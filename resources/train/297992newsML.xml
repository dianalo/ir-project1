<p>Weak technicals, which triggered a wave of selling, sent SIMEX Nikkei March futures plummetting more than 500 points to rest precariously over its psychological support level of 18,000, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was strictly technicals and the way the stops were situated which set off a wave of reaction,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>After hitting a high of 18,770, the benchmark Nikkei 225 March contract ended down 525 points at 18,155 on a turnover of 18,800.</p>
<p>It saw some selling around 18,500 in the afternoon ahead of the options expiration in Osaka, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The futures tend to gravitate towards the (option) strike price ahead of the expiration,&quot; the dealer said. &quot;In this case, it was 18,500.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said major Japanese and European institutions were among active sellers, and were soon joined by nervous locals.</p>
<p>&quot;When March fell below 18,500, technicals overtook and stops triggered, sending the futures below 18,100,&quot; said the dealer.</p>
<p>The March contract was expected to consolidate around the 18,000 level for the next couple of days. An upward rally was expected given a lack of new bearish domesitic news, dealers said. -- Angela Tan (65 8703083)</p>
