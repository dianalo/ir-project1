<p>Vasily Tsibliyev, commander of the Mir space station, said on Thursday he and his flight engineer should not be made scapegoats for the ageing craft's problems.</p>
<p>But the Russian cosmonaut said after landing safely in the steppes of Kazakhstan with flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin that they were also not heroes for saving the ship.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very easy to find someone to shoot, pop, pop, and he's gone. Who does this help?&quot; a tired but talkative Vasily Tsibliyev said as he was flown back to Moscow after the landing.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you can't look for who is guilty.&quot;</p>
<p>Tsibliyev was manually docking Mir with its cargo resupply ship on June 25 when the two craft collided in the worst accident in Mir's 11-year stay in space.</p>
<p>Russian media said Tsibliyev, who later developed heart irregularities during the flight, was responsible. President Boris Yeltsin said last week &quot;human factors&quot; appeared to have caused the accident.</p>
<p>But space officials also thanked Tsibliyev and Lazutkin for their good work on Thursday and Yeltsin issued a statement praising their &quot;persistence, courage and heroism&quot;.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev called for a patient review of Mir's recent woes as officials draw their final conclusions.</p>
<p>&quot;The commission will examine the question calmly,&quot; he said, seated by Lazutkin in a flight cabin with a table laden with watermelon. &quot;We'll know all that they have established and they will know what we know.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mir crew closed off the punctured Spektr module immediately after the accident, saving the ship and probably their own lives, but the commander said that did not make them heroes.</p>
<p>&quot;What is heroism? Someone who perishes under a tank in an explosion, I understand that to be heroism,&quot; he said. &quot;We are alive and have returned.&quot;</p>
<p>The two cosmonauts, who spent six months in orbit, were originally slated to do the repairs to fix the damage done in the June 25 collision.</p>
<p>But the job was given to a replacement crew, who reached the orbiting Mir a few days ago, after Tsibliyev developed an irregular heartbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we're sorry we couldn't do the repairs and that there were many things we wanted to do in the station,&quot; the commander said, dressed in sneakers and a light space uniform.</p>
<p>Lazutkin, who seemed tired but smiled frequently, joked when asked about his experiences on Mir, which both cosmonauts described as very difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;I was my first flight so unfortunately or fortunately I had nothing to compare it to,&quot; he told the handful of reporters on board. &quot;It was an interesting flight.&quot;</p>
<p>Tsibliyev said: &quot;It was an interesting flight because we were in situations that no one has encountered.&quot;</p>
<p>On the final leg of their long journey home after entering the earth's atmosphere in their Soyuz capsule and an hour-long helicopter ride from the Kazakh steppe, the cosmonauts took a three-hour flight back to Moscow.</p>
<p>They enjoyed some red wine and a meal of caviar, chicken, sausage, cucumbers and boiled potatoes.</p>
<p>The mood was festive and some on the space recovery team broke out vodka to celebrate the crew's safe return.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank God we're home,&quot; Tsibliyev said.</p>
