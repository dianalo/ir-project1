<headline>UK gilts tread water, end touch firmer.</headline>
<text>
<p>1625 GMT - UK gilts off highs but slightly up on the session in quiet market with few domestic factors to provide direction. Outlook positive but dealers see little activity ahead of Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls.</p>
<p>* June gilt futures end up 3/32 at 112-03.  </p>
<p>Market sentiment remained broadly positive following Monday's PMI and money supply data, suggesting moderate growth in the economy with no unduly worrying signs of inflationary pressure, dealers said.</p>
<p>This helped nudge gilts higher in early trade.</p>
<p>&quot;If the market were to move lower, I've got a lot of people who'd love to get in...but I don't think it will,&quot; the salesman said.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke holds his monthly monetary meeting with Bank of England Governor Eddie George on Wednesday but no change in base rates is expected.  </p>
<p>With few domestic factors likely to influence the market this week, investors sought guidance overseas, anxiously awaiting Friday's U.S. non-farm payroll figures.</p>
<p>&quot;Payrolls and further down the road the (March 25) FOMC will cause the market to tread water for a while,&quot; said Nigel Richardson, head of bond strategy at Yamaichi International.</p>
<p>&quot;It is deadly dull right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the House Budget Committee that the most likely outlook for the U.S. economy was continued growth and low inflation.  </p>
<p>Gilts mildly outperformed Bunds in the session, with the 10-year gilt/Bund spread narrowing to 177 basis points by the end of the session from 179 on Monday.</p>
<p>June short sterling futures ended the day up eight basis points at 93.55, implying official interest rates of around 6.45 percent at the end of the second quarter compared with the present 6.0 percent.</p>
