<p>Interbank rates fell across the board as funds returned to the banking system through maturities and from the retail sector, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said one-week interbank rate was at 7.0 percent against 7.50/60 on Thursday and one-month at 7.30/35 percent against 7.35/40.  </p>
<p>Two-week money was quoted at 7.10/20 percent against 7.40/50, three-week was at 7.20/25 against 7.35/40.</p>
<p>Three-month to one-year money were at 7.30/35 percent against 7.35/40 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>The overnight rate on Thursday closed at 5.0 percent against a steady 8.6/7 percent in the last few days as a couple of large local banks started lending.</p>
<p>The dealers said the large banks, whose lending pulled down the overnight rate on Thursday, were reporting being flushed with funds returning from the retail sector following the Chinese Lunar New Year and Moslem Eid al-Fitr festivals.  </p>
<p>An estimated three billion ringgit had left the banking system temporarily for the two festivals.</p>
<p>In addition, the maturity of a 500 million ringgit Bank Negara bill issue added to the liquidity on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks are really flush today,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>He said Bank Negara has limited the number of days on which it accepted cash deposits from banks to Wednesday and Friday. Only when the cash is deposited with the central bank can commercial banks use the funds in the interbank market.</p>
<p>No confirmation was available from Bank Negara.  </p>
<p>Only after cash is deposited with the central bank do funds become available to banks' treasuries to trade in the interbank money market.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the change in central bank's system, our branches have been holding cash for nearly a week before they could deposit it,&quot; said the head of dealing at a large bank.</p>
<p>Dealers said interbank rates would ease further in the coming week unless Bank Negara intervened in the market.</p>
