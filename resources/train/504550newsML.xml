<p>Manchester United stayed on course to win the English premier league for the fourth time in five years when they beat Blackburn 3-2 in a pulsating Lancashire derby on Saturday.</p>
<p>Blackburn, the only other club to win the premier league since its inception in 1992, battled hard in the spring sunshine and gave United a scare in the dying minutes when Paul Warhurst scored Rovers second, but United were never seriously troubled.</p>
<p>Following a surprise home defeat by Derby last week and their 1-0 reverse to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup on Wednesday, Ferguson kept his side in Germany on Thursday for an extra day's training -- and the move paid off.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of coming back at two in the morning after the match, we stayed the extra day, carried out some treatment in Germany and trained there. It certainly worked for us on this occasion,&quot; Ferguson said afterwards.</p>
<p>United even survived a rare penalty miss from their French skipper Eric Cantona, whose weak 22nd-minute spot kick was easily saved by Tim Flowers.</p>
<p>Goals from Andy Cole (32nd minute), Paul Scholes (43rd) and Cantona (80th) secured the points for United, while Billy McKinlay (34th) and Warhurst (88th) scored for Rovers.</p>
<p>There was no talk of the end-of-season fixture congestion which has dominated the headlines for most of the last week after the victory either.</p>
<p>Ferguson refused to be drawn on the issue, merely explaining that he rested David Beckham because he wanted his three freshest players in midfield.</p>
<p>While United were winning at Blackburn to move on to 66 points with five matches remaining, Arsenal kept in contention with a 2-0 home win over Leicester to move on to 63 points with four matches to play.</p>
<p>Arsenal's French manager Arsene Wenger, who has been involved in a war of words with Ferguson over the United's manager bid to have the season extended, said afterwards: &quot;I have always said Manchester United were a very good team who are competitive in every game they play.</p>
<p>&quot;All we can do is finish the season as best we can and pick up as many points as possible. It is very important for us to be in Europe next season.&quot;</p>
<p>Arsenal beat an under-strength Leicester, who play Middlesbrough in a replay of the League Cup final next Wednesday, with goals from Tony Adams (35th) and David Platt (66th) and keep the pressure on third-placed Liverpool.</p>
<p>Roy Evans's men, beaten 3-0 by Paris St Germain in the Cup Winners' Cup on Thursday, travel to relegation-threatened Sunderland on Sunday and must win to keep their title hopes alive.</p>
<p>They are currently six points behind United but have a match in hand and play United at Anfield next Saturday.</p>
<p>With Middlesbrough playing Cheserfield and Wimbledon meeting Chelsea in the F.A. Cup semifinals on Sunday, only three other premier league matches were played.</p>
<p>In the most important of those, Southampton beat West Ham 2-0 to move out of the relegation zone.</p>
<p>The Saints won despite having Jason Dodd sent off for violent conduct after 44 minutes and Jim Magilton missing a penalty after 24 minutes.</p>
<p>A Michael Evans header after 13 minutes and a second from Israeli striker Eyal Berkovic nine minutes before the break moved Southampton up from 19th to 16th -- although they are only three points better off than last-placed Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>Everton won for only the third time in 17 league matches -- their first victory under caretaker player-coach Dave Watson -- when they beat Tottenham 1-0 with an 11th-minute headed Gary Speed goal separating the teams.</p>
<p>Tottenham, whose season has been wrecked by injury, had more bad luck with Danish midfielder Allan Nielsen and Irish defender Stephen Carr failing to finish the match because of injuries.</p>
<p>The result just about banishes Everton's fears of relegation while Derby's 2-1 win over Aston Villa guarantees their premier league status for next season.</p>
