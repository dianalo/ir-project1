<p>Security Council members on Monday called on combatants in Afghanistan to work again toward a negotiated peace despite signs that full-scale fighting will resume as the winter snows melt.</p>
<p>The 15-member council, in an open debate, took no action but put its views on record in advance of a Wednesday conference in New York among interested governments exploring ways to get a settlement of the war.</p>
<p>Norbert Holl, the German diplomat who serves as special U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, briefed members behind closed doors and blamed all sides for believing in a military victory.</p>
<p>&quot;Every Afghan party has a bad record when it comes to sincere will and determination for peace,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The purist Islamic Taleban movement has already conquered about 75 percent of the country and the capital of Kabul and is advancing north against its enemies, led by Uzbek General Abdul Rashid Dostum and Ahmad Shah Masood, the former government's military chief.</p>
<p>A.R. Ghafoorzai, the acting foreign minister of the Afghan government ousted by the Taleban, told the council the Taleban was preparing a &quot;massive attack&quot; against northern Afghanistan. He also appealed to Pakistan's new government to &quot;curtail the flow of arms and assistance to a group in Afghanistan that wants to impose a draconian military rule.&quot;</p>
<p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have been accused of sponsoring the Taleban, while Russia and Iran are said to be funnelling arms to the opposition. U.S. officials have been accused of being ambivalent toward the Taleban.</p>
<p>But U.S. representative Edward Gnehm called reports that Washington had given support to the Taleban &quot;disinformation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We do not support the Taleban or any other group,&quot; he said. &quot;But neither do we put blame on the Taleban for the ills of Afghanistan for which all parties are responsible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The United States government has repeatedly urged an end to the fighting and a practical dialogue in the spirit of compromise,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have also encouraged others to make this key point, in particular to the Taleban: stability cannot be achieved if one group tries to rule all of Afghanistan on its own,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Britain's ambassador, Sir John Weston, said &quot;the parties continue to receive arms from the outside.&quot; He said the European Union had adopted an arms embargo and other countries should do the same.</p>
<p>Chile's ambassador Juan Somavia warned the council not to soften its opposition to the Taleban's treatment of women, who are banned from the workplace and schools, forced to wear veils over their faces and punished severely if they disobey.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want this council to look to one side if a political agreement is finally achieved that would agree to the practices that are being perpetrated against women.&quot;</p>
<p>Women's rights, he said, should not be &quot;sacrificed on the altar of peace.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said the international community was giving mixed signals to combatants. &quot;In the contemporary world no faction would get involved in a civil war without external support. They (the factions) all know that any military victory is more advantageous than a negotiated peace.&quot;</p>
