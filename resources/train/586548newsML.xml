<headline>Dow Chemical says on track to meet goals.</headline>

<p>Dow Chemical Co president William Stavropoulos told shareholders Thursday that the company is &quot;rapidly closing in&quot; on its key financial goals, which include earning three percent above its cost of capital.</p>
<p>Stavropoulos told shareholders that the $20 billion-a-year company also is on track to earn a 20 percent return on equity and to achieve eight percent growth over the current business cycle. Dow considers the current business cycle to have begun in 1992. A company spokeswoman declined to predict when the company expects the current business cycle to end.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our sales in the Asia Pacific region are growing rapidly, and we expect them to triple by the year 2005,&quot; Stavropoulos said.</p>
<p>He also said DowElanco, the agricultural chemicals venture that Dow announced Thursday it is taking full control of, will see its sales grow to $5 billion by 2005 from $2 billion today.</p>
<p>Such performance chemicals now make up 50 percent of Dow's operating income and Stavropoulos said he would like to see that grow to 60 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;Despite our size, we still have plenty of room to grow... and to grow profitably. Over the course of the next cycle, we expect our growth initiatives to add $10 billion in new sales.&quot;</p>
<p>Dow also is aggressively cutting its investment costs. A new aniline plant at the BSL plant in eastern Germany is being built for 35 percent less than a traditional facility. &quot;And we'll do even better in the future...reducing capital costs by 50 percent for each successor plant we build,&quot; Stavropoulos said.  </p>
<p>Dow board members also said they would vigorously fight against silicone-gel breast implant litigation naming the company as a defendant. Although the company maintains that it never made, sold or did research on breast implants, plaintiffs have claimed that it is liable because of industrial silicone testing it did in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p>Dow wrote off its investment in Dow Corning Corp, its silicone joint venture with Corning Inc which was once the world's largest breast implant maker. Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection in May 1995.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will not give away our company on lawsuits that in our mind are basically ill-founded,&quot; said Dow Chemical board chairman Frank Popoff.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, breast implant protestors attended the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;It's time for Dow Corning to take responsibility and quit hiding behind the bankruptcy court because we need a settlement now, not later,&quot; said Betty Tilley, a Cincinnati woman who blames her former implant for joint pain, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and other ailments.</p>
<p>&quot;For some women, it might be too late. They are dying,&quot; she said.</p>
