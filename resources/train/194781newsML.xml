<p>Senior Chinese Politburo member and parliamentary head Qiao Shi is due to arrive in Vietnam late on Sunday, marking the second top-level visit between the two communist countries in just months.</p>
<p>Foreign ministry officials said Qiao would meet Vietnam's three top leaders on Monday and Tuesday as well as his National Assembly counterpart, Nong Duc Manh, and former prime minister Pham Van Dong.</p>
<p>Qiao, associated with the tougher line taken by Beijing against Taiwan earlier this year, was also scheduled on Tuesday to lay a wreath at the mausoleum in Hanoi of Vietnam's late president and spiritual leader, Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>Diplomats and other analysts said Qiao's visit is significant as it comes only months after that of Premier Li Peng, who in late June by became the highest foreign official to attend a Vietnamese Communist Party Congress.</p>
<p>But they also point out that despite party-to-party ties the two countries have a long history of troubled relations.</p>
<p>In 1979 China sent its military pouring over the border into Vietnam to punish Hanoi for its invasion of Cambodia a few weeks earlier.</p>
<p>China was repulsed, but border differences from that period are still unresolved, as are territorial differences over island-chains in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Pro-China groups in Vietnam's government have traditionally been associated with military or security elements in the leadership.</p>
