<p>A new computer and improved procedures at the Department of Finance helped the agency collect more than 1,500 percent more a year in unpaid taxes from city vendors, city Comptroller Alan Hevesi announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a follow-up audit by the comptroller's office, it was determined that the percent increase comes to an average of nearly $1 million a year more recouped by the department, compared to $55,000 collected under its old system, the comptroller said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the years, the city will collect millions more in unpaid taxes from vendors as a result of improvements made at the Department of Finance, which were spurred by a 1992 Comptroller's Office Audit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Each year the city pays hundreds of millions of dollars to vendors while, at the same time, trying to collect millions of dollars in back taxes from some of them.</p>
<p>The comptroller's audits recommended to the department, among other things, the use of computers. The follow-up audit sought to determine whether the recommendations from the prior review were addressed by the new system.</p>
<p>The audit found that all the recommendations have been implemented.</p>
<p>The Department of Finance collects about $11 billion annually in various city taxes, including real estate, general corporation, hotel occupancy and commercial rent taxes.</p>
