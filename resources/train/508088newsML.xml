<p>------------------------(April 14)-----------------------------</p>
<p>*Stocks ended weaker but off lows in muted reaction to the Dow's sharp fall on Friday. Volume 215.7 million, value A$552.3 million, 1,038 stocks traded, 265 steady, 180 up, 593 down  </p>
<p>Australian shares ended mildly weaker on Monday in a muted reaction to a sharp sell-off on Wall Street on Friday which followed a surprising jump in U.S. wholesale prices.</p>
<p>The Australian Stock Exchange's benchmark All Ordinaries index ended 14.4 points lower at 2,366.1, well off its intra-day low of 2,349.1. The June share price index closed five points down at 2,356, a 10.1 point discount to the underlying index.</p>
<p>Dealers said investors marked down blue chip issues by about one percent early but recovered nearly half these losses over the course of the session as bargain hunters emerged.  </p>
<p>&quot;You can't draw too many conclusions - total market turnover was pretty low. Overall, the market is behaving logically when you consider Australia's economy is in a different phase to America's,&quot; a Brisbane-based dealer said.</p>
<p>The dealer said the low turnover also reflected a considerable amount of investor caution in respect of possible further volatility on Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;I think if Wall Street market bounces even slightly tonight you should see quite a few buyers step into the market tomorow morning,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>Major bank issues remained in the spotlight following last week's release of the much-awaited Wallis inquiry into Australia's financial system.</p>
<p>Westpac Banking Corp and Commonwealth Bank of Australia were the best supported of the big four, both finishing slightly firmer after opening lower.</p>
<p>There was also good buying interest in oil and gas hopeful Cultus Petroleum Ltd. Cultus shares continued to push higher on positive sentiment over its prospects in Victoria's Otway Basin and the possibility of the company obtaining new exploration permits in that area.  </p>
<p>In other markets, Australian bond yields ended a thinly traded session higher in the wake of Friday's sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, although the short end gave up only a little ground. The yield on 10-year T-bonds closed at 8.02 percent, up 0.08 points from Friday's close.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar sagged more than 1/3 of a cent through a slow Monday session as the weight of worry over eroding yield premiums undermined support.</p>
<p>At 5.20 p.m (0720 GMT), the local dollar was quoted at US$0.7805/10 compared to its Friday close at US$0.7857/62.  </p>
