<p>NARODNA OBRODA - Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik, currently on a two-day visit to Moscow, and his Russian counterpart, Alexander Livshits, discussed a promised Russian $50 million loan for the completion of Mochovce nuclear power plant. The money should come as a part of the repayment of Russian debt to Slovakia, which totals some $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>- Kozlik said Slovakia wanted the Russian debt repayments to total at least $160 million a year.</p>
<p>- The Slovak Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SOPK) has called for the government and the central bank to urgently approve measures to help stabilise the interbank market.</p>
<p>- The SOPK said turbulent development with interbank rates had made credits too expensive for entrepreneurs and that this was slowing down restructuring of the entire economy.</p>
<p>- President Michal Kovac is considering calling the two planned referenda - on NATO membership and on direct presidential elections - on the same day.</p>
<p>- 1996 sugar production totalled 226,000 tonnes, some 68,000 tonnes more than in 1995. The amount will fully cover the country's annual sugar production, for the first time since 1989.</p>
<p>- Only 4,419 privatisation bonds have changed hands in anonymous trading on the O-T-C RM-System since the beginning of the year. The bourse registered 374,714 orders to sell the bonds.</p>
<p>- The ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) would win some 24.5 percent of votes if an election had been held at the end of January. The opposition Christain Democratic Movement (KDH) would finish second with 12.7 percent, followed by Democratic Union (DU) with 12.2 percent. The two minor coalition partners, the Slovak National Party (SNS) and the Workers Party (ZRS), had showed only 5.2 and 4.6 percent of political preferencies, respectively.</p>
<p>HOSPODARSKE NOVINY - Slovakia's industrial production is expected to continue to increase in February, according to a survey by the Slovak Statistical Bureau.</p>
<p>- The Bratislava Stock Exchange is planning to start derivatives trading in November.</p>
<p>- Slovakia's sole oil refiner Slovnaft said it now controlled some 70 percent of the country's petrol stations, mainly through its subsidiary Benzinol.</p>
<p>- Modernisation programmes of Slovakia's engineering industry will require investment of around 14 billion crowns over the next four years. About 55 percent of the investment should be covered by loans, 27 percent own resources and the remaining part subsudies.</p>
