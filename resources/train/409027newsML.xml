<headline>Ringgit rebounds as offshore parties sell dollar.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-02-27</dateline>

<p>The ringgit rebounded against the dollar as the market discounted worries about the possibility of a U.S. rate hike, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said dollar/ringgit sales by offshore players broke a dollar-support level at 2.4850. &quot;There was heavy offshore selling,&quot; said a Malaysian bank dealer.</p>
<p>He said the next strong support for dollar/ringgit was at 2.4780.</p>
<p>The dollar's weakness was also linked to its retreat against the yen in Tokyo, dealers said. &quot;The yen has came off,&quot; said another dealer.  </p>
<p>Research house MMS International said there was also market talk the dollar/ringgit fall was due to a corporate samurai bond issue of $400 million.</p>
<p>The ringgit had started on a weak note following overnight dollar gains after comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan which hinted of an interest rate hike.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.4833/43 per dollar against 2.4810/20 at the end of Kuala Lumpur trading on Wednesday.</p>
