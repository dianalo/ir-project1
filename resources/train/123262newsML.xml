<p>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed's bodyguards detained and disarmed several men who had been following him on Thursday, his press service said.</p>
<p>Lebed, who is involved in a bitter war of words with Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, told a news conference on Wednesday he was being followed.</p>
<p>The press service of President Boris Yeltsin's Security Council, of which Lebed is the secretary, said in a statement that the detained men said they had been ordered to follow Lebed by a senior interior ministry official.</p>
<p>Weapons and unspecified special equipment had been found on them, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;A.Lebed disciplined the detainees briefly and they were released afterwards,&quot; the statement said. It gave no more details.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the interior ministry.</p>
<p>Kulikov accused Lebed on Wednesday of trying to seize power by force while Yeltsin prepared for heart surgery. Lebed has dismissed the accusations and threatened to sue Kulikov.</p>
