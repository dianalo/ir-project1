<p>Japan crude imports for the first half of 1997 show a subtle but significant decline in sales volumes from Qatar, a trend which Japan traders attribute to recent quality concerns over the country's Qatar Marine grade.</p>
<p>Qatar, whose crude represents a small but consistent slab of the Japanese crude diet, sold an average 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 1997. The figure marks a 6.7 percent loss from 1996 levels, and a nine percent loss from 1995 levels.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a worry for us that the quality of Qatar Marine has dramatically changed because the grade was co-mingled with the much heavier Al Shaheen crude,&quot; a trader with a Japanese refiner said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Qatar Marine -- a composition of crude oil from the Idd El Shargi, Maydan Mahzam, Bul Hanine and other less significant oil fields offshore Qatar -- experienced an initial 40,000 bpd boost in production in 1996 thanks to new volumes from the Al Shaheen field.</p>
<p>But traders say Al Shaheen's introduction to the then 200,000 bpd Qatar Marine production pool was less than welcome due the new grade's lower 33 American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity.</p>
<p>The lower a crude grade's API number, the heavier and less valuable it is in terms of quality.</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout much of this year we witnessed a steady drop-off in the API gravity of Qatar Marine, because of blending with Al Shaheen and, to some extent, Al Khaleej,&quot; one Japanese trader said.</p>
<p>Qatar's Al Khaleej field, which went onstream in early March, produces roughly 17,000 bpd of crude with a heavier quality than Al Shaheen.</p>
<p>Recognized global specifications for Qatar Marine crude oil list the grade at about 36.2 API gravity. But traders say that figure dropped to below 32 earlier this year.</p>
<p>The grade's API gravity is said to have improved to levels of 34/35, since buyers complained in March to state firm Qatar General Petroleum Corp (QGPC) and, as of June, the producer stopped including Al Shaheen and Al Khaleej in the Qatar Marine blend, traders say.</p>
<p>&quot;QGPC was flexible enough to adjust the price in response to our complaints and cut out the Al Shaheen, but the quality of Qatar Marine is still something less than it used to be,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Since the Qatari producer began keeping Al Shaheen separate, the heavier grade has gained growing acceptance in Asia thanks to lucrative pricing.</p>
<p>At least two cargoes were sold to Japanese refiners last week at a reported price of Dubai minus 53 cents.</p>
<p>Traders say the grade's production volumes have grown to roughly 100,000 bpd.</p>
