<p>Zapata Corp said Tuesday its board decided against selling or liquidating the company after reviewing a previously disclosed proposal from Michael Heisley.</p>
<p>The company said it will instead pursue a new multi- industry strategy that includes expanding into various businesses and said it &quot;is currently pursuing a possible significant acquisition&quot; as part of its new strategy.  </p>
<p>The company said it will not recommence its self tender, which ended February 2, following receipt of the Heisley proposal. However, it said the board still believes Zapata stock is undervalued and has authorized purchases of up to five million shares of Zapata common stock.</p>
<p>The company said Chief Executive Malcolm Glazer has said he will not sell Zapata any of the estimated 10.4 million shares he beneficially owns. Zapata said that, if it repurchases all five million shares authorized, the percentage of its common stock beneficially owned by Glazer would rise to about 42.3 percent.  </p>
<p>The company said it will enter into an agreement with Glazer in which he will not take any action take the company private.</p>
<p>The company also said its board reaffirmed its commitment to adding two or more independent directors to the board in 1997.</p>
