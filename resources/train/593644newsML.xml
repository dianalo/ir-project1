<title>BANGLADESH: Bangladesh evacuates people on cyclone's path.</title>
<headline>Bangladesh evacuates people on cyclone's path.</headline>
<dateline>CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh 1997-05-18</dateline>

<p>Thousands of volunteers started evacuating millions of people from the path of a cyclone heading towards the Bangladesh coast from the Bay of Bengal on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Around 15 million people live on the coast and nearby islands, and it's a difficult task to get them away from the feared cyclone,&quot; one cyclone official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already started the process because the cyclone now looks definitely heading towards our coast,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Witnesses said thousands of people were taken to cyclone shelters by trucks and other vehicles as strong wind and rain had started hitting the coast.</p>
<p>&quot;This operation may be hampered when the storm gains strength as night grows,&quot; said police Inspector Abu Yusuf supervising the evacuation.</p>
<p>At least 33,000 government and Red Crescent volunteers fanned out in Bangladesh's coastal areas on Sunday after weather officials said the storm, with winds up to 200 kph (120 mph), might hit the coast by early Monday.</p>
<p>They said the entire coast was likely to be swept by rainstorms before the cyclone makes its actual landfall. It could trigger waves of up to four metres (12 ft) that could swamp widespread coastal areas, including islands.</p>
<p>Fishermen have been warned not to leave port and coastal officials had been told to hoist &quot;great danger&quot; signals.</p>
<p>According to a latest bulletin from the Storm Warning Centre the cyclone was located 510 km (316 miles) south southwest of Chittagong port at 3 p.m. (0900 GMT) on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The storm is advancing at a speed of 25 kph (16 miles an hour). The speed may gather momentum and in that case the storm is expected to hit the coast after midnight,&quot; Amirul Hussain, regional director of the Meteorological Department, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The volunteers have been asked to closely monitor the situation and standby for large scale evacuation,&quot; said Abdul Wahab, a Bangladesh Red Crescent field official.</p>
<p>&quot;Sitting on the cyclone's eye are the ports of Chittagong and Mongla and the Cox's Bazar resort,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials at the Chittagong port said some 24 ships, now berthed at jetties, would be moved soon to outer anchorages.</p>
<p>&quot;We are taking this precaution so the ships do not collide during the storm and jam the channel by sinking,&quot; said Quamrul Islam, Harbour Master of Chittagong port.</p>
<p>Mongla port officials said they were taking similar action.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one man was killed and five injured when lightning struck them near Cox's Bazar on Sunday afternoon, local officials said.</p>
<p>State-run radio and television frequently broadcast storm warnings.</p>
<p>People fleeing their homes or being moved to cyclone shelters have been asked to keep drinking water, food and other essentials underground for the cyclone's aftermath.</p>
<p>Bangladesh's worst cyclone in 1991 killed more than 138,000 people and left millions homeless.</p>
