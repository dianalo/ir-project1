<p>Rescue workers searched for more bodies from the wreckage of a bombed Indian train and officials said the army had launched a search operation for suspected tribal guerrillas.</p>
<p>Officials said more victims were expected from the wreckage but not as many as 300 initially believed killed. Almost 60 have been found since the blast on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Rescue operations are still being carried out by the police,&quot; a police official in Guwahati, the capital of the northeastern state of Assam, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A senior army official told Reuters in Calcutta the army had cordoned off the site of the blast and was helping operations.</p>
<p>&quot;We have started an offensive against the separatist rebels responsible for the blast,&quot; the army official, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters in Calcutta by telephone.</p>
<p>Three of the train's 19 coaches -- each crammed with up to 100 people leaving for the New Year holiday -- were destroyed in the blasts after the train left Kokrajhar station in Assam state for Delhi, police said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which authorities blamed on Bodo tribal guerrillas who have waged a violent separatist struggle for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>The Bodos have demanded a separate tribal state north of the Brahmaputra river since the early 1980s. Their campaign took a violent turn at the end of the decade.</p>
<p>By Tuesday afternoon 59 bodies had been recovered at the site of the attack in the town of Sensapani, some 200 km (125 miles) west of Guwahati, authorities said.</p>
<p>Dozens of mutilated bodies, some of them children, lay on a soft rice paddy field near the tracks. Darkness and the remoteness of the region initially hampered rescuers and compounded confusion over the number of dead.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all flesh and one can't distinguish bodies,&quot; the army official said.</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda condemned the attack. The visiting Israeli President Ezer Weizman in a letter to Sharma said he was outraged by the bombing of the train.</p>
<p>Police said a remote-controlled device was used to blow up the Delhi-bound Brahmaputra Mail, an express train named after the sacred river that flows through India's north-east.</p>
<p>About 54 survivors lay huddled in a remote hospital in Alipurduar town in neighbouring West Bengal state.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the injuries were head injuries and fractures. All the local people volunteered to help and donated blood,&quot; Niyati Roy, a nurse at the hospital, said.</p>
<p>The injured were lying on dirty sheets. Cats roamed the hospital wards.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a backward place in India. There are no specialist doctors. There is a shortage of equipment, insufficient staff and communications are bad,&quot; said Roy.</p>
