<p>The United Nations on Monday authorised the start of a long-delayed &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal with Iraq, enabling Baghdad to make a limited return to the world oil market for the first time since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Under the plan, concluded in May but held up by disputes over implementation, Iraq will be able to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods after six years of sanctions.</p>
<p>Security Council President Francesco Paolo Fulci of Italy called it &quot;the largest humanitarian operation ever launched by the United Nations in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after notifying council members that Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had given the final go-ahead, Fulci said: &quot;More than 20 million innocent Iraqi civilians will be finally saved from starvation and untold suffering.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It means that anaesthesia will finally available for surgery. It also means that four out of 10 newborn children will no longer die before they reach age one,&quot; Fulci said.</p>
<p>Both the oil sales and the purchase of humanitarian supplies are subject to close U.N. monitoring. If all goes well, the Security Council may renew the deal when the initial six months expire.</p>
<p>Under Security Council resolution 986 of April 1995, on which the plan is based, the initial six-month period was scheduled to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies stressed that the agreement did &quot;not signal an end or the first step toward the end of the sanctions regime against Iraq, against (President) Saddam Hussein's regime.&quot;</p>
<p>A prime condition for the full lifting of sanctions, which includes a ban on normal oil sales, is word from the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of disarming Iraq that all its weapons of mass destruction have been scrapped.</p>
<p>The head of the commission, ambassador Rolf Ekeus, is now on one of his periodic visits to Baghdad, trying to account for Iraq's arsenal of SCUD missiles.</p>
<p>In giving the green light, Boutros-Ghali said: &quot;This is a victory for the poorest of the poor of Iraq, for the women, the children, the sick and the disabled. I hope the humanitarian dimension will always prevail in the work of the United Nations.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) has said 4,500 children under the age of five were dying each month from hunger and disease while the U.N. World Food Programme estimated about 180,000 children under five were malnourished.</p>
<p>Iraq will be able to export slightly under 600,000 barrels of oil a day, according to current prices. It exported over three million barrels a day before the Gulf War.</p>
<p>The proceeds will be placed in an escrow account in the New York branch of the Banque Nationale de Paris.</p>
<p>Some $1.32 billion of each $2 billion from the oil sales will go for humanitarian supplies, including $260 million earmarked for goods for the largely Kurdish-populated north.</p>
<p>Of the remainder, $600 million will be funnelled into a U.N. compensation fund to pay Gulf War reparations. Another $20 million will go to the cash-strapped U.N. weapons commission while administrative and operational costs account for most of the rest.</p>
<p>After months of negotiations, the United Nations and Iraq signed an agreement covering the oil deal last May 20. But its implementation was further delayed until Iraq accepted all U.N. conditions on Nov. 25.</p>
<p>These include the stationing of some 150 U.N. inspectors to ensure that food and other supplies reach all sectors of the population, not just those favoured by the Iraqi government. Another 32 inspectors from Lloyd's Register will check on the import of the humanitarian goods.</p>
<p>In addition, 14 U.N. inspectors from the Dutch-based Saybolt company, already in place, will monitor the outflow of Iraqi oil at three locations -- at a pipeline metering station at Zakho, on the Iraq-Turkish border; at the Turkish terminal of Ceyhan; and at the Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr.</p>
<p>Most of the oil is to be exported through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline. The last element to fall in place was a report to Boutros-Ghali last Friday that the metering equipment at Zakho, previously out of order, had been repaired and was now functioning.</p>
