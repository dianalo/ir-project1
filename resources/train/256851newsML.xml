<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-RICHTER BLANKS SABRES, GRETZKY REACHES ANOTHER MILESTONE.</headline>
<dateline>BUFFALO, New York 1996-12-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mike Richter stopped 30 shots for his first shutout of the season and Wayne Gretzky reached another milestone in his storied career with his 1,800th assist as the New York Rangers blanked the Buffalo Sabres 3-0 on Friday.</p>
<p>Alexei Kovalev had a goal and an assist in New York's three-goal second period.</p>
<p>Richter, who recorded his 15th career shutout, made nine saves in each of the first two periods and 12 in the third, extending his personal unbeaten streak to seven games (6-0-1) as Buffalo suffered its sixth shutout loss this season.</p>
<p>Ulf Samuelsson gave Richter the only goal he would need with a powerplay tally at 7:38 of the second.</p>
<p>Gretzky earned his milestone assist on Kovalev's goal just over two minutes later. He cut down the right wing and centred the puck to Kovalev, who got behind the Buffalo defence and flipped a wrist shot past Dominik Hasek.</p>
<p>Gretzky picked up a second assist on Brian Noonan's powerplay goal at 15:59, completing the scoring.</p>
<p>The Rangers were once again without injured captain Mark Messier. But Gretzky has risen to the challenge with four goals and 11 assists in the last eight games.</p>
<p>In San Jose, Patrick Lalime stopped 20 shots for his first NHL shutout and Tomas Sandstrom scored twice as the surging Pittsburgh Penguins blanked the Sharks 4-0 for their sixth straight win.</p>
<p>Jaromir Jagr took a pass from Kevin Hatcher, who recorded two assists, and scored his league-leading 30th goal with six minutes left in the first to give the Penguins a 2-0 lead.</p>
<p>The Czech star has points in 13 straight games with 15 goals and nine assists in that span.</p>
<p>Sandstrom scored 6:51 into the second period and 7:53 into the third, both times with the teams skating four a side.</p>
<p>In St Louis, Murray Craven and Kevin Miller scored 3:35 apart late in the second period to lift the Chicago Blackhawks to a 4-1 victory over the Blues.</p>
<p>Chicago is 5-0-1 in St Louis since the Blues moved into the new Kiel Centre last season.</p>
<p>Jeff Hackett made 20 saves as Chicago ended a four-game slide by sending the Blues to their fourth straight home loss.</p>
<p>Craven's goal snapped a 1-1 tie with 5:03 left in the second. Miller scored on the power play with 1:28 to go, unleashing a blistering slap shot that beat Grant Fuhr, who finished with 30 saves.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, Bob Corkum broke a tie with 4:06 left in the second period and Keith Tkachuk set up a pair of goals to lead the Phoenix Coyotes to a 4-2 win over the Senators.</p>
<p>Shane Doan passed from behind the Ottawa net to a charging Corkum, who one-timed a shot over goaltender Damian Rhodes to give the Coyotes a 3-2 lead. Doan added an empty-netter with 15 seconds left in the game to ice the win for Phoenix, which got a 24-save performance from goalie Darcy Wakaluk.</p>
<p>Jeremy Roenick and Brad McCrimmon also scored for the Coyotes. Aklexei Yashin and Alenandre Daigle scored both Ottawa goals in the first period.</p>
<p>In Dallas, Andy Moog stopped 24 shots and Greg Adams scored the go-ahead goal late in the second period as the Stars scored a rare 2-1 home win over the Vancouver Canucks.</p>
<p>Moog faced only five shots in the third period and diving defenceman Sergei Zubov broke up Vancouver's best scoring opportunity by keeping Pavel Bure from getting off a shot on a breakaway until he had passed the Dallas goal.</p>
<p>Richard Matvichuk scored the first goal for Dallas, which won for just the third time in its last 10 home games. Adams snapped a 1-1 tie with 5:23 left in the second.</p>
<p>Lonny Bohonos scored his first NHL goal at 13:09 of the second to break up Moog's shutout bid.  </p>
<p>In Anaheim, J.F. Jomphe set a franchise record by scoring twice in a 13-second span late in the second period and Dmitri Mironov had two goals as the Mighty Ducks held on for a 5-4 victory over the Washington Capitals.</p>
<p>Jomphe lifted Anaheim into a 3-3 tie when he took a pass from Jari Kurri, cut down the right wing and beat goaltender Jim Carey with 2:09 to go in the middle period.</p>
<p>Jomphe put the Ducks ahead at 18:01, firing in a wrist shot from the left faceoff circle.</p>
<p>Peter Bondra recorded a hat trick for Washington with a short-handed goal, an even strength tally and a powerplay goal with 31 seconds left. He could have had a fourth goal but fired wide on a penalty shot in the final minute of the second period.</p>
