<p>The Egyptian company that runs the SUMED oil pipeline will shut down one of its terminals for 24 to 48 hours probably in the third week of July as part of an expansion project, an official at the company said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be named, told Reuters that the firm had rescheduled tankers that load crude at SUMED's Sidi Kerir terminal on the Mediterranean and the brief closure would not affect average throughput.</p>
<p>&quot;The exact date has not yet been set but it will take 48 hours maximum to finish this, fitting more pipes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>SUMED, which is 50 percent owned by the Egyptian government, runs across Egypt from Ain Sukhna at the head of the Gulf of Suez to the Mediterranean. The other SUMED shareholders are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>The official denied market talk that the pipeline would shut for four days from July 23 for maintenance. &quot;During 21 years of operation, we have never completely shut down. We always work round affecting throughput,&quot; he added.</p>
