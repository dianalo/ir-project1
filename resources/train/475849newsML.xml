<p>Organisers of a mass march in Strasbourg against the rise of France's far-right National Front said on Sunday that the protest marked a turning point in efforts to curb the party and its fiery leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen.</p>
<p>But the peaceful daytime march was marred by clashes between police and young people on Saturday night, and Le Pen and other Front leaders dismissed the demonstration as meaningless, saying the protesters and not their party were to blame for France's woes.</p>
<p>Witnesses said three policemen were injured by stonethrowers trying to reach the congress building. Police responded with tear gas and made seven arrests. Three officers were wounded.</p>
<p>Police later clashed with demonstrators at a rock concert in the city centre, firing tear gas at hundreds of young people after some of them set fire to a car and threw bottles at them.</p>
<p>Some 15 shop windows were shattered throughout the city during the night, officials said. They said 40 people were taken into custody, and 34 remained behind bars on Sunday, including nine who were to be brought before a magistrate later in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The danger does not come from the National Front but from the other side,&quot; Le Pen said at the start of a three-day party congress in the eastern city.</p>
<p>He told the 2,200 delegates: &quot;I want you to go tell the French people they have nothing to fear from the National Front and everything to hope for.&quot;</p>
<p>The party congress is electing leaders and plotting strategy for March 1998 general elections in hopes of breaking into parliament, where it currently has no seats despite Le Pen's 15 percent showing in the 1995 presidential election.</p>
<p>Optimistic about their prospects, Front leaders even began setting out an ambitious legislative programme for next year including the introduction of a preference in education, jobs and social benefits for &quot;native-born&quot; French people.</p>
<p>Other elements of the programme would bar France from European monetary union, send home immigrants and empower citizens to pass laws through a referendum.</p>
<p>Le Pen chose Strasbourg for the congress because it gave him his highest score in 1995 -- 26 percent of the vote in a city that is home to the European parliament and the Council of Europe, set up after World War Two to foster democracy and human rights across the continent.</p>
<p>The march, organised by an ad hoc coalition of mostly leftist groups, attracted tens of thousands of people who came from Spain, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium as well as France.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the first day of the reconquest of minds lost to the National Front,&quot; said Greens leader Dominique Voynet, who marched with Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin, Communist chief Robert Hue and Strasbourg's Socialist mayor Catherine Trautmannn.</p>
<p>The Front has appeared to soar in strength and influence in recent months. Since the 1995 presidential poll, it has won four town halls, including the Provence town of Vitrolles last month.</p>
<p>It also weighed heavily in the centre-right government's decision to tighten immigration laws, giving it the appearance of setting the national agenda on an issue troubling many voters.</p>
<p>While publicity about the party and its outspoken leader is often negative, Le Pen basks in the media spotlight, convinced that all publicity is good publicity.</p>
<p>The congress will re-elect him as party president, choose a central committee and draft an election platform and campaign strategy. Le Pen, 68, the party's founder, is unopposed and has refused to discuss a successor.</p>
