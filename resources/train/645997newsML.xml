<p>Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga plans to reshuffle her 23-member cabinet on Monday, state radio announced on Sunday.</p>
<p>It gave no details but the report follows weeks of speculation and media reports of the impending reshuffle, which will be the first since Kumaratunga's People's Alliance (PA) coalition won power in parliamentary and presidential polls in 1994.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe said he had no information about the planned reshuffle but said an announcement would be made on Monday.</p>
<p>Newspapers have said Kumaratunga plans to either remove Srimani Athulathmudali, Minister of Transport, Highways, Environment and Women's Affairs or prune her portfolios because of policy differences with her.</p>
<p>Athulathmudali heads the Democratic United National Front (DUNF), a member of the PA coalition.</p>
<p>Kumaratunga is also reported to be planning to give another portfolio to Labour Minister Mahinda Rajapakse because he has been criticised by the business lobby for being seen as pro-labour.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports said Kumaratunga was also planning to hand the media portfolio to Posts and Telecommunications Minister Mangala Samaraweera, one of her confidants and a member of her kitchen cabinet.</p>
<p>The media portfolio is now held by Dharmasiri Senanayake who is also Minister of Tourism and Aviation.</p>
