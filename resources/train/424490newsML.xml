<p>British electronic, ceramic and plastic industrial materials company Cookson Group Plc said on Thursday it expected to resume earnings growth in the second half of this year after profits turned lower in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect trading conditions to remain unchanged for the balance of the first half. A return to growth in earnings is then anticipated, the extent of which is dependent upon both the recovery in the electronics industry and the course of sterling,&quot; chief executive Richard Oster said.</p>
<p>Oster said sterling's strength could cut between five million pounds and 10 million pounds ($8.1 million and $16.1 million ) off earnings this year but he said the problem was not significant because most of its businesses manufactured and sold products in the local currency.</p>
<p>Oster described 1996 as a &quot;year of pause&quot; as the company reshaped its business towards technology-led activities and disposed of its loss-making units. Pretax profit before exceptional items dropped by eight percent to 166 million pounds, while group turnover rose four percent to 1.88 billion pounds.</p>
<p>Despite the drop in earnings, Cookson raised its final dividend to 4.7 pence per share from 4.5 pence a year earlier, bringing the total dividend to 8.6 pence, up from eight pence.</p>
<p>Oster said the company's Advanced Refractories, Engineering Products and Plastics divisions continued to maintain a satisfactory performance.</p>
<p>But Cookson Matthey Ceramics, the joint venture with Johnson Matthey, still faced difficult conditions in the zircon business, while business at the Electronics division, where sales in organic terms dropped two percent last year and profits shrank 18 percent, remained little changed.</p>
<p>But Oster said he was optimistic for electronics.</p>
<p>&quot;We should certainly see an improved year in electronics too...book-to-bill ratios on equipment are now over one-to-one. It's the same with semi-conductors, personal computers, telephones and generally electronics worldwide, driven by consumer products and automotive,&quot; Oster said.</p>
<p>Oster said Cookson was well poised for growth and its positive cash flow figures had surprised the City. Cash flow totalled 11 million pounds last year, down from 50 million a year earlier. Oster said Cookson had been expected to post negative cash flow.</p>
<p>A company source said Cookson, which has now disposed of all its loss-making businesses in a radical restructuring programme, could sell more businesses to fund growth and make possible acquisitions in the Asian-Pacific region and Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a possibility of more disposals, perhaps one or two, and that would give a cash mountain over the next four years of over 500 million pounds to help grow the businesses worldwide,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;Acquisitions would be across the board but with an eye to expanding geographically in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. It would go across all divisions but primarily electronics materials and ceramics,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Cookson shares, which have dropped by almost a fifth since the start of the year on worries about the group's profitability, were up four pence at 233-1/2p in London. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds)</p>
