<p>The operating life of oil platforms in the UK North Sea is being extended as technology improves, operators weigh up the implications of shutdown and new operators with cheaper overheads move in, an industry expert said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Technology is getting better and operators can now squeeze more crude out at the end of a field's life,&quot; said Nick Terde, editor of the Quarterly Review of the North Sea Abandonment Market.</p>
<p>Improved technology has extended the life span of fields and platforms and new wells have been drilled at some fields, extending production for two to three years.</p>
<p>One field, Alwyn North, was scheduled for abandonment in 1999 but now will be operating until at least 2025 following the discovery of fresh reserves.</p>
<p>Also emerging is a breed of end-of-life operators, companies that come in and take over the running of fields in their mature days.</p>
<p>Smaller operators, these companies reverse production economics compared with a field's start-up operator.</p>
<p>Terde's report said Canadian oil company Talisman Energy Inc, which recently purchased the ageing Beatrice, Buchan and Clyde platforms, saw them all surviving at least until 2000.</p>
<p>U.S. oil company Oryx Energy Co has pushed the abandonment date for its Murchison and Hutton installations to 2001 and 2002, respectively.</p>
<p>Public reaction to the disposal of platforms once fields are shutdown are also important considerations for operators who have not forgotten the negative publicity Royal/Dutch Shell attracted over its Brent Spar rig in 1995.</p>
<p>Next in line to cease operations in the North Seae  are the Heather, Hutton and Maureen fields.</p>
<p>Heather's operator, Unocal Corp, is intending to topple the platform jacket, but Amoco Corp is still examining the options on its Hutton North West installation. Maureen operator Phillips Petroleum is marketing the refloatable around the world.</p>
<p>Following are latest revised shut down dates for UK North Sea platforms:</p>
