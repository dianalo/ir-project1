<title>USA: CME hog calls mostly higher, pork bellies higher.</title>
<headline>CME hog calls mostly higher, pork bellies higher.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-27</dateline>

<p>Early calls on CME hog futures ranged from up 0.300 cent a lb to off 0.100 while pork bellies were called 0.250 to 0.500 cent higher, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Most analyts expect renewed demand in hog futures after Thursday's late profit taking. Another round of higher cash markets Friday morning and rising wholesale pork values should boost futures prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>Pork cutout values rose $1.91 to $1.82 per cwt Thursday and moved up to highest levels since August 21.</p>
<p>Larger packer kill capacity is driving live prices higher especially with cash pork prices rising, they said.</p>
<p>However, some analysts again look for a mixed trend ahead of Friday's quarterly USDA Hogs and Pigs report, especially after posting new contract highs in October and December Thursday and then easing. Much of the report is already in the market but trade may still be uneven at times, they said.</p>
<p>Average indications on Friday's report point to all hogs as of September 1 at 96.2 percent of a year ago in a range of 95 to 97.5 percent. Kept for breeding estimates averaged 96.8 percent in a range of 94 to 99 and kept for market estimates averaged 96.5 and ranged 95 to 98 percent of last year.  </p>
<p>But farrowing intentions for September/November and December/February averaged near 100 percent and the high end of expectations ranged from 102 to 105 percent. A figure of 100 percent or more would signal a return to increasing hog production by the large producers, analysts said.</p>
<p>Pork belly futures look higher following another advance in cash belly prices despite fairly active slaughter.</p>
<p>Rising cash shows very good demand for product, they said.</p>
<p>USDA estimated week to date slaughter through Thursday at 1,451,000 head, above 1,420,000 a week ago in the same period and also above 1,432,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>Despite the greater amount of pork moving into the supply pipeline, cash belly prices rose to as much as $82 per cwt Thursday, the highest level since August 28.</p>
