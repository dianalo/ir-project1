<title>HONG KONG: Hong Kong's shadow lawmakers study flag laws.</title>

<p>Hong Kong's controversial provisional legislature on Saturday looked at more bills before the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in July, further risking legal challenge from the territory's Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The sitting also marked the first time a senior Hong Kong government official has attended the interim assembly, despite Governor Chris Patten's refusal to assist the chamber.</p>
<p>China set up the provisional legislature last year to replace the currently elected Legislative Council after Patten introduced wider suffrage in defiance of Beijing's protests.</p>
<p>Two bills which would give legal protection to Chinese national and regional flags and emblems in Hong Kong passed the initial hurdle in the shadow legislature -- the first and second readings.</p>
<p>The third and final reading would be carried out before China takes over from the British at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party, the territory's largest, has threatened to sue the interim body if it passes any laws or meets in Hong Kong before July 1.</p>
<p>The Democrats say it is constitutionally illegal to have two legislatures operating at the same time.</p>
<p>The two pieces of legislation were the second and third being introduced to the interim legislature, which has held all its meetings in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen to avoid challenges to its legality.</p>
<p>According to the bills, a person would be punished for &quot;publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling on&quot; China's red flag and Hong Kong's post- colonial bauhinia flag and emblems.</p>
<p>The punishments included three years in jail and a maximum fine of HK$50,000.</p>
<p>Currently there is no law against desecration of the British Union Flag in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Fanny Law, who has been seconded to the office of Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa from the colonial government, attended the provisional legislature meeting and introduced the two bills.</p>
<p>Law, who is now director of Tung's office, shrugged off criticism her attendance posed a conflict of interest. &quot;Civil servants should be politically neutral,&quot; she told reporters outside the meeting hall in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong government spokeswoman said Tung had promised he would not put seconded officials in difficult positions and he needed to address the problem himself.</p>
<p>&quot;If seconded civil servants are tasked to carry out any duties which may be perceived as putting them in a difficult position, it will be for the Chief Executive-designate to address such a perception,&quot; an official from the government information service said by telephone.</p>
<p>Patten has repeatedly said his government would not assist the provisional legislature which would reverse his electoral reform replacing the currently elected Legislature Council.</p>
<p>Britain has said the interim body is illegal and unnecessary, while pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong condemn the move by China as a way of snuffing out democracy after the handover.</p>
