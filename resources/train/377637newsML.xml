<p>Bad weather again disrupted the Alpine skiing world championships on Friday, forcing organisers to crowd three races into a final day which may see some women competing twice.</p>
<p>The women's combined downhill, called off on Thursday and Friday due to high winds and snow, was re-scheduled for 1200 GMT on Saturday, when huge crowds are expected to watch Alberto Tomba in action later at night.</p>
<p>Before that, the regular women's downhill will be held at 0930 GMT. The men's slalom at 1700 and 2000 will then be the final event before the closing ceremonies.</p>
<p>As things stand, the re-scheduling is likely to affect the German women Katja Seizinger and Hilde Gerg most.</p>
<p>Seizinger is the 1994 Olympic downhill champion and a frontrunner for the world title. She is also well placed with Gerg, another good downhiller, for the combined title.</p>
<p>There are 19 starters in the combined downhill and only a handful of them have any real chance of a medal, although if the weather again turns nasty the race could be shortened, giving downhillers less chance to make up time.</p>
<p>The slalom leg of the combined was held on Thursday. Italy's Morena Gallizio was fastest and carries a 2.30 second lead but has little experience of downhills.</p>
<p>The combined remains the most doubtful of Saturday's three races since the regular downhill takes precedence.</p>
<p>If the downhill cannot go ahead at 0930, it will be delayed until later in the morning which would then force the cancellation of the combined downhill.</p>
<p>Italy's super-G champion Isolde Kostner complained the combined seemed to have been set for a better time until it was explained to her that the reasoning was to give the regular downhill as much of a chance as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd be much happier for the race to be at 1 pm,&quot; she said. &quot;That's the time we all trained for.&quot;</p>
<p>The Italian, her country's favourite for the gold, added however that weather forecasts she had seen made it very doubtful the downhill would be at 0930 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;All the forecasts say it will get better in the early afternoon,&quot; the 21-year-old said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not nice to be up there in the bar wondering whether it will go ahead or not for hours at a time,&quot; she said. &quot;We've had to do that too often already this season.&quot;</p>
<p>The women had two speed races in a day on December 7 in Vail, where a World Cup super-G was followed by a downhill.</p>
<p>Two women's downhills were also scheduled for the same day in Bad Kleinkirchheim, Austria, in January because of bad weather but only one was eventually staged.</p>
<p>The last two world championships in Japan and in southern Spain in 1993 and 1996 were also hit by bad weather.</p>
<p>The decision to postpone Friday's race was made after officials had already delayed the start by an hour because of wind and snow, which began falling overnight and dumped several centimetres on the Kandahar piste.</p>
<p>The weather improved considerably later in the day but much work needed to be done in preparing the piste.</p>
<p>Organisers had said earlier that the postponement could, in a worst case scenario, extend the championships to Sunday or Monday although that would cause major problems.</p>
