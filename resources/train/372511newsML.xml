<headline>Emerging debt prices up as Bulgarian Bradys lead.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Most emerging debt prices ended the New York trading session higher, with Bulgaria outperforming others and major Latin credits tightening 15 to 20 basis points, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bullish sentiment continued to propel Bulgaria Brady bonds higher on the heels of the previous session's gains, they said.</p>
<p>At 1700 EST/2200 GMT, Bulgaria's FLRBs were 1-7/8 stronger at 44 bid, and its IABs were 1-1/8 firmer at 56-5/8 bid. The country's discount bonds were 3/4 higher at 60-1/2 bid.  </p>
<p>Bulgaria's outgoing Socialists agreed to give an interim cabinet wider powers to negotiate and conclude agreements with international lenders to help pull the country out of its economic crisis.</p>
<p>Among other emerging debt issuers, Russian Vnesh US$ performed well, gaining 1/2 to 83-1/4 bid.</p>
<p>Among Latin credits, Argentine FRBs were quoted 1/8 higher at 91-3/8, Brazilian &quot;C&quot; bonds were 1/2 stronger at 80-1/2 bid, while Mexican pars were 5/8 firmer at 77-1/4 bid. Venezuelan FLIRBs were 1/4 better at 91 bid.  </p>
<p>&quot;We saw some decent price action in the major Latin credits: Argentina, Brazil and Mexico....We've seen a lot of money going into those countries,&quot; another Brady trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a lot of demand, not only on the debt side but the equities side,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Among the major credits, Peru and Mexico debt tightened by about 20 basis points, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico was catching up....Yesterday it was kind of lagging, and today it caught up with the rest of the countries,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>In Peru, talks between the government and Marxists hostage-takers are not expected to lead to a quick solution to the crisis. Both sides have agreed to a pact of silence, leaving others to speculate as to what points were discussed during a four-hour meeting held Tuesday.</p>
<p>Regarding Ecuador Bradys, the appointment of Fabian Alarcon as president failed to boost the country's debt amid sluggish activity, traders said.</p>
<p>Ecuadorean bonds posted losses, with par bonds quoted off 7/8 at 45-1/8 bid, and PDI bonds down 1-1/8 at 60-7/8.  </p>
<p>&quot;Ecuador has widened....We continue to see some major client liquidations out of there,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>In the government market, the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was unchanged at 97-11/32 to yield 6.71 percent at the close.</p>
