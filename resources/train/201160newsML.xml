<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard has condemned attempts to rewrite Australian history as one long apology for past wrongs, such as the exploitation of Aborigines.</p>
<p>Injustices had been committed, but on balance Australian history was a heroic achievement of which its people should be proud, Howard told a meeting of his Liberal party.</p>
<p>Australians had to &quot;ensure that our history as a nation is not written definitively by those who take the view that Australians should apologise for most of it,&quot; he said in a speech on Monday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;This black-arm-band view of our past reflects a belief that most Australian history since 1788 has been little more than a disgraceful story of imperialism, exploitation, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination.</p>
<p>&quot;I take a very different view.&quot;</p>
<p>The prime minister, whose Liberal-National government was elected in March, has been accused of inadequately dealing with a sudden debate on immigration and aboriginal welfare that has gripped the nation.</p>
<p>Howard was slow to criticise controversial Independent member of parliament Pauline Hanson, who has said that aboriginal welfare is too generous and that Australia is in danger of being swamped by Asian immigrants.</p>
<p>But Howard has rejected the views expressed by Hanson. His government says it is changing aboriginal welfare to produce concrete results rather than merely feed money into an ineffectual bureauacracy.</p>
<p>Australia's 260,000 Aborigines, many living in outback communities, suffer poor health, short life expectancy, high rates of imprisonment and very low employment.</p>
<p>Some economic historians believe Aborigines' living conditions in 1788, when British settlers arrived, were far ahead of those enjoyed by most people in England.</p>
<p>Howard's government has slightly reduced the size of the immigration programme and intends to skew it in favour of skilled migrants rather than those seeking reunion with relatives who are already living in Australia.</p>
