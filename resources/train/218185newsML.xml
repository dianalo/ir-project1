<p>Britain and the Gulf oil state of the UAE will sign a defence cooperation pact on Thursday, ending years of haggling and opening up prospects of more military sales in one of the world's wealthiest arms bazaars, diplomatic sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo is due in the United Arab Emirates' capital Abu Dhabi for what the British embassy said would be talks with senior members of the Arab state's federal government.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said he would meet Sheikh Mohammed bin Zaid al-Nahayan, armed forces chief of staff and chairman of the UAE Offsets Committee, and his younger brother Sheikh Hamdan bin Zaid, minister of state for foreign affairs.</p>
<p>An agreement would be signed by Portillo and Sheikh Hamdan, one source said.</p>
<p>The UAE already has defence pacts with the United States and France that have helped smooth the way for defence-related orders worth more than $4.3 billion in the last three years.</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi has been using its French pact signed in December, under which Paris pledges to rush 70,000 rapid reaction force troops and air power to the UAE if it is threatened, as a model for all others.</p>
<p>A senior UAE official confirmed Sheikh Hamdan (corrects name from Hamad) would sign the agreement.</p>
<p>Asked whether Britain had met some of the UAE's demands for a pact along the lines of the one with France, the official said: &quot;You know we will only sign something that is good...It is not a photocopy of the French accord. In some ways yes (as firm as the French accord) and in others not...but in part and parcel it is a good accord.&quot;</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said during a visit to Abu Dhabi earlier this month that the two countries were close to an agreement on defence cooperation.</p>
<p>Agreement has been held up by arguments over what law should govern British forces serving in the UAE. UAE officials insisted any British troops deployed in their country must be liable to UAE jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Portillo said on a previous visit to Abu Dhabi they had to find a solution which was consistent with the tradition of armed forces being responsible to their own governments when they were in their service, even in another country.</p>
<p>Britain already has defence agreements with two of the UAE's five partners in the security-conscious Gulf Cooperation Council, Kuwait and Qatar.</p>
<p>But its role as protector of the small, sparsely-populated oil states on the Arab side of the Gulf has been superseded by the United States, which maintains a fleet of warships including an aircraft carrier in the strategic waterway.</p>
<p>UAE Foreign Minister Rashid Abdullah al-Nuaimi said on Saturday foreign troops deployed in the Gulf were essential to preserve the region's security and stability.</p>
<p>It will be Portillo's second visit to the volatile region in less than two weeks. On November 17 he signed a $825 million arms deal with Qatar, with which Britain already has a defence agreement.</p>
<p>The Qatari deal was described by Western diplomats and industry sources as a coup for Britain, whose defence companies have been losing lucrative Gulf business to U.S. and French competitors since the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>It involved GKN Piranha armoured personnel carriers, Vosper Thorneycroft patrol boats, British Aerospace Hawk trainers and Starburst missiles made by Short Missile Systems, a joint venture between Canadian-owned Short Brothers and Thomson-CSF of France.</p>
<p>The UAE has spent $6 billion on procuring arms over the last 10 years and is negotiating for a fleet of 80 long-range strike aircraft, a package worth another $6 billion.</p>
<p>But the defence pact appears to have come too late for that. Britain was no longer on the short-list, official sources said earlier this year, and only American and French companies were left in the running.</p>
