<p>KEL Holdings Ltd, a unit of UDL Holdings Ltd, is expected to raise HK$100 million by issuing 100 million new shares at HK$1.00 each in its initial public offering (IPO) of shares, market sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The issue price represents a price to earnings multiple of 7.2 times on a fully-diluted basis and 5.8 times on a weighted average basis, sources said.</p>
<p>Dividend yield is about 5.2 percent and net asset value per share is HK$0.45, they said.</p>
<p>KEL forecasts its net profit to be no less than HK$52 million for the year ended in March 1997, up from HK$44 million in 1996, said one analyst after attending a company presentation on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company is scheduled to hold a press briefing unveiling its listing plan on Wednesday. Its IPO is expected to run from April 10 to 15 and dealing in shares is expected to begin on April 24, they said.</p>
<p>KEL is involved in the design, supply, installation and maintenance of electrical and mechanical (E&amp;M) engineering services and environmental engineering services such as waste water handling, water treatment and sewage treatment works.  </p>
<p>Last month, the marine engineering group UDL said it would list separately its wholly-owned subsidiary KEL and UDL shareholders would be offered one KEL share for every seven UDL shares held.</p>
<p>Amsteel Corporate Finance (H.K.) Ltd is the sponsor of the issue and UOB Asia Ltd is the co-sponsor, it said.</p>
