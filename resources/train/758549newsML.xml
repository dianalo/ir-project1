<headline>UK's Blair says Charles can wed Camilla - report.</headline>

<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair is ready to give government approval for royal heir Prince Charles to marry his lover Camilla Parker Bowles, the Sun newspaper reported.</p>
<p>But the prime minister's blessing will depend on the couple winning the support of the British people and the Church of England, the tabloid said in its Monday editions.</p>
<p>Charles has been taking steps to give Camilla greater public exposure as the woman in his life.</p>
<p>But many Britons blame her for the break-up of Charles's 15-year marriage to Princess Diana and say they could never accept Camilla, who is also divorced, as the next queen of England.</p>
<p>The Sun quoted a close friend of Blair as saying: &quot;His instincts tell him that if Charles and Camilla wish to marry they sould be allowed to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;But he would be pretty mindful of any church opposition.&quot;</p>
<p>As prime minister, Blair has sweeping powers to advise Queen Elizabeth over the succession to the throne.</p>
<p>He has made it clear that he has no sympathy with some Labour Party members who want to do away with the monarchy.</p>
<p>One of Blair's closest aides, Minister without Portfolio Peter Mandelson, has had talks with Charles, 48, Camilla, 50, and Diana, 36.</p>
<p>Camilla hit the headlines earlier this month when Charles hosted a glittering 50th birthday party for her at his country residence, Highgrove.</p>
