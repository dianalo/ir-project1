<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices fell Thursday in moderate trade, as buyers eyed sinking crude and lackluster utility demand, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Resid prices certainly came off pretty hard with crude. You can't find a buyer for anything right now,&quot; said one cash trader, noting utility interest even before the crude slide was almost non-existent.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent skidded $1.25 to the $19.50-75 area, with NYH November paper done early at $19.65 but quoted later at $19.00-50, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH December one percent paper, sold early at $20.15, was talked later in the $19.50-75 area. Q1 paper was quoted late at $19.40-65, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in NYH lost a dollar or more, with 2.2 percent now pegged at $18.50-75 and three percent at $17.75.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent eased a quarter to $18.25-50, while three percent fell $1 to the low-$17 area.</p>
<p>No USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York City gate baseload gas sold Thursday at $3.38/mmBtu versus NYH one percent November paper at a $3.06/mmBtu equivalent. December gas in New York was quoted near $4/mmBtu compared to NYH one percent December paper at a $3.12 equivalent.</p>
