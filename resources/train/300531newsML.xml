<title>MALAYSIA: Ringgit eases against dollar on covering.</title>
<headline>Ringgit eases against dollar on covering.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-01-10</dateline>

<p>The ringgit eased against the dollar on Friday as players squared their short-dollar positions ahead of the weekend, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The ringgit is taking a breather. This is expected as its rise has been quite drastic,&quot; said a local bank dealer in Kuala Lumpur. The ringgit jumped about 400 points this week to an eight-month high of 2.4800 a dollar on Thursday.</p>
<p>Its rise was capped by commercial dollar demand and speculation of intervention by Bank Negara Malaysia.</p>
<p>At 1000 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.4848/55 a dollar against 2.4805/15 at close of Kuala Lumpur on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the ringgit rise on Thursday was helped by a news report which quoted Deputy Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar as saying the government was comfortable with the recent strengthening of the ringgit.</p>
<p>Demand for the ringgit has picked up significantly following a survey of financial institutions in Singapore and London which showed that the Malaysian unit was likely to be the most favoured Asian currency this year.</p>
<p>A Singapore-based European bank dealer said a lot of U.S. funds were switching from the Singapore dollar into the ringgit.</p>
