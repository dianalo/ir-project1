<p>Two of Germany's top regional banks on Monday revealed plans to merge into a Bavarian banking giant second only to market-leader Deutsche Bank AG, marking the first significant shake-up in an industry long viewed as ripe for consolidation.</p>
<p>Bayerische Vereinsbank AG and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank AG, both Bavarian specialists in mortgage lending and ranked fourth and fifth respectively among listed commercial banks, aim to join forces as of October to form Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG.</p>
<p>The new bank will have combined assets of 743 billion marks ($416 billion), outranking Dresdner Bank AG and not far off Deutsche, whose total assets in 1996 were 886 billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is not an exaggeration to say that this is the realisation of a vision in Europe's banking market,&quot; Hypo-Bank chairman Eberhard Martini told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Hypo-Bank and Vereinsbank alone are too small to realise the economies of scale which are necessary on the enlarged market. By merging they have reached a volume which will enable them to remain competitive and to act autonomously in the future European market.&quot;</p>
<p>Germany's banking industry has been awash with merger talk for a year, with the &quot;Bavarian solution&quot; presented today seen as one of the likeliest options for an industry revamp.</p>
<p>The merger, which averts the danger of one or both of the Bavarian banks being swallowed up by a Frankfurt rival, is a shot in the arm for Munich, the fiercely independent leading business centre in the southern German region.</p>
<p>The news was immediately welcomed by Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber, widely understood to have been a driving force in securing the deal. Investors also gave the plans a firm thumbs-up, sending bank shares leaping ahead.</p>
<p>Vereinsbank shares, which have nearly doubled on merger talk in the past year, rose 3.4 percent to 85.70 while Hypo-Bank jumped 14 percent to 66.70 marks, having earlier traded just under the 75-mark takeover offer price at 73 marks.</p>
<p>Shareholders in Hypo-Bank will be offered shares in insurer Allianz AG at a rate of one Allianz share per six Hypo-Bank shares held, equating to a price of around 75 marks per share. This will give Vereinsbank a stake of up to 45 percent in Hypo-Bank, which it will use as the basis for a full merger .</p>
<p>The Allianz shares will come from Vereinsbank's 10 percent stake in the insurance group, of which it plans to retain two percent. Allianz, in turn, will own some 15 percent of the new bank and hopes to use its network as a distribution outlet.</p>
<p>Shareholders will be asked to give formal approval by spring 1998. The German cartel office must also approve the deal but analysts said this was unlikely to be problematic.</p>
<p>Analysts had mixed views of the plan. Commerzbank immediately raised its recommendation on the top five listed German banking stocks to a &quot;buy&quot;, while Salomon reduced its recommendation on Vereinsbank to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot;.</p>
<p>Salomon analyst Matthew Czepliewicz said he was concerned that the new bank would not be able to achieve its earnings goals because of political pressure not to shed too many jobs.</p>
<p>The merger is expected to cost around 1.3 billion marks in restructuring costs but the banks said it would also cut expenses by much as one billion marks per year in five years and spark a &quot;marked increase&quot; in earnings.</p>
<p>Vereinsbank chairman Albrecht Schmidt and Hypo-Bank's Martini, both of whom have said they are available to head up the new bank, refused on Monday to specify how many jobs of a combined 40,000 would be shed.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not embarking on a cost defensive but on a quality offensive,&quot; Schmidt said. &quot;We need every hardworking and qualified man and woman on board our larger ship in order to make progress on this stormy world market.&quot;</p>
<p>Martini conceded that there were strong overlaps between the banks but said both banks have reduced staff in recent years and that branch closures would lead to better staffing levels at the branches remaining.</p>
<p>The banks together had staff turnover of 2,000 employees per year, Martini added, signalling that job cuts could thus be carried out in a very socially acceptable manner.</p>
<p>Expectations that the financial services sector was on the brink of a shake-up gained fresh currency in recent weeks after news of a merger of two insurers under Munich Re.</p>
<p>Rumours had been rife that a major deal was underfoot since last August, when Deutsche Bank triggered merger frenzy by announcing it had a 5.2 percent stake in Vereinsbank.</p>
<p>The rationale behind mergers is clear. Germany is regarded as heavily overbanked with more than 3,600 commercial, public and cooperative banks battling for market share, and a rate of one branch per 1,100 inhabitants.</p>
<p>The top five banks, led by Deutsche, have a joint market share of just 14 percent and are struggling to make their costly retail branch networks more efficient.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what we have now is the solution for Bavaria. What will be interesting now is what happens elsewhere.&quot; said Commerzbank AG analyst Dieter Hein.</p>
<p>Other major corporates responded cautiously.</p>
<p>Dresdner Bank AG , the current number two bank in Germany, which could have merged with Hypo-Bank under one of the alternative scenarios, said in a statement that it did not expect the merger to disrupt its strategic links to Allianz.</p>
<p>Deutsche gave a cautious welcome to the plans, terming its stake in Vereinsbank &quot;a good investment&quot;. Viag, which indirectly owns 10.24 percent of Vereinsbank, said it would retain its stake in the bank. ($ = 1.787 German Marks)</p>
