<headline>Prague bourse says plans to delist 400 shares.</headline>

<p>The Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) said on Monday that it would de-list around 400 mainly low-liquidity shares by the end of June, starting with an initial 100 by the end of March.</p>
<p>Jiri Franc, general secretary of the PSE, said the exchange would look at shares which fell into the following three categories over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>1) Those whose trade turnover was below 200,000 crowns ($7,160).</p>
<p>2) Those with a market capitalisation under five million crowns.</p>
<p>3) Those which have failed to trade for more than five days.</p>
<p>Issues which fail to fulfil conditions one and two or one and three would be eligible for de-listing, Franc said.</p>
<p>There are currently 1,751 shares on the PSE, many of which are small companies which were listed as a direct result of the Czech Republic's massive voucher-for-shares privatisation programme completed in early 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all about a step towards standard conditions. All issues were put there because of coupon privatisation. We want on the bourse those companies which themselves want to be there and will fulfil (release of) information obligations,&quot; said PSE chairman Tomas Jezek.</p>
<p>Jezek is a vocal campaigner for greater transparency and tighter regulations on the Prague bourse and said the move would bring the PSE more into line with prevailing conditions on the international capital markets.</p>
