<p>The dollar rose to a 2-1/2 month high against the Japanese yen Tuesday but pulled back slightly against the German mark after rising on Monday to its highest level in more than 7-1/2 years.</p>
<p>Currency traders largely ignored news the Clinton administration and Republican leaders reached an agreement to balance the federal budget by the year 2002.</p>
<p>The dollar came under pressure early in the day after U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in an interview that Japan had clearly stalled on its pledge to open up its automotive sector to U.S. automakers.</p>
<p>But the market reversed course later in the day, as dealers who had bet the dollar would fall were forced to buy once the currency held above key technical levels.</p>
<p>After climbing briefly to 118.45 yen, the dollar settled at 118.35 yen late on Tuesday (corrects day from Monday to Tuesday), its highest close since May 13 and up from 117.87 yen on Monday.</p>
<p>A weak yen would result in higher U.S. imports of Japanese goods and raise the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, long a bone of contention between the two countries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dollar fell against the mark, but managed to pare the bulk of its morning losses.</p>
<p>&quot;Heavy selling out of Europe today failed to break the dollar's back,&quot; said Stephen Flanagan, senior dealer at Credit Agricole Indosuez.</p>
<p>The dollar got some additional help from Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick, who said in a German newspaper interview that the German central bank must be very careful when assessing the weak mark against the backdrop of a weak German economy.</p>
<p>Koebnick also was quoted as saying that the Bundesbank will ensure the &quot;stability pact&quot; against inflation despite rising import prices.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 1.8365 marks, down from 1.8440 marks on Monday when it touched its highest level since November 1989.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the British pound weakened to $1.6275 from Monday's close of $1.6327. The dollar rose to 1.5180 Swiss francs compared with 1.5150 on Monday. It fell to Canadian $1.3847 from C$1.3859.</p>
