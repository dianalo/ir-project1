<p>The Chinese yuan closed down at a two-week low of 8.2955 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai on Monday due to profit-taking, traders said.</p>
<p>The close was down from 8.2944 last Friday and the lowest close since April 15 when the yuan ended at 8.2959.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Friday was 8.2943.</p>
<p>Dealers said the yuan failed to maintain its upward trend on Friday after rises earlier last week, which caused profit-taking on Monday and forced it to fall for most of the session.  </p>
<p>The yuan opened higher at an intraday high of 8.2940 and consolidated for most of the session, hitting a low of 8.2958 late in trading, traders said. Trading was active with most business done at 8.2950, they said.</p>
<p>One dealer said Friday's fall made traders cautious and some sold the local currency to take profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The yuan moved mostly above the key 8.2950 level last week and it needed a technical correction,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A second dealer said pro-yuan sentiment was strong despite the fall on Monday and that he expected it to rebound shortly.  </p>
<p>&quot;The yuan will fall sharply,&quot; he said. &quot;A brief movement around the 8.2950 will be good for further rises.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the yuan to rise slightly on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The market will close for the Labour Day holiday from Thursday to Saturday, resuming on Sunday, an exchange official said.</p>
<p>The yuan closed up at 6.5410 from 6.5625 against 100 Japanese yen and down at 1.0713 from 1.0700 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
