<headline>Germany says has Bundespost pensions under control.</headline>

<p>Germany said on Wednesday the cost of early retirement by civil servants working for the old state post office would not hit state finances this century and did not threaten Bonn's bid to join European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Extra costs of 7.5 billion marks ($4.4 billion) by 1999 will instead be borne temporarily by the successors to the Deutsche Bundespost -- partly privatised Deutsche Telekom AG, Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Postbank AG.</p>
<p>The contributions paid by the three firms to so-called &quot;support funds&quot; will be refunded out later from dividend income and privatisation revenues received by the state, Post Ministry spokesman Christian Hoppe told a news conference.</p>
<p>Hoppe was responding to a report in the Frankfurter Rundschau daily which said the unexpected pensions gap could ruin Germany's bid to join EMU and alleged Bonn had resorted to &quot;financing tricks&quot; to fix the problem.</p>
<p>But Finance Ministry spokeswoman Barbara Eckrich, rejecting allegations that the government was resorting to any such tricks to qualify for EMU, said the pensions arrangement would have no impact on German efforts to control state borrowing, to take part in the launch of the euro currency, planned for 1999.</p>
<p>No extra costs would be faced by the state before then, she said. &quot;Meeting the Maastricht treaty is seen by Germany and its partner states as a long-term goal. That is our goal and we will achieve it,&quot; she told reporters.</p>
<p>The deficit pension payments are for civil servants at the three companies, which were spun off from the Bundespost in a reform implemented in 1995. Since then the hiring of civil servants -- who are difficult to sack -- has stopped.</p>
<p>The Post Ministry explained that the support funds needed 43.5 billion marks in extra cash between 1995 and 1999.</p>
<p>Yearly payments to the funds by Deutsche Post are four billion marks, by Telekom 2.9 billion and Postbank 310 million marks -- totalling 36 billion marks over the period.</p>
<p>The outstanding 7.5 billion marks will be paid in &quot;early&quot; by the companies -- and returned by the federal government on the basis of dividend and privatisation revenues later.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the so-called financing trick, but no government funds will be required,&quot; Hoppe said. &quot;This interim financing applies only to 1995 to 1999 and will be repaid with dividends after 1998 and via privatisations from 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>Still open is the question of financing total federal funding needs of 75 billion marks by the year 2010, and Hoppe said the outstanding gap was around 20 billion marks. The three firms are due to pay in 80 billion marks to the funds.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom, which listed more than 25 percent of its capital on international stock exchanges last year, declined to comment on the report. A spokesman emphasised, however, that the government was liable for any pension fund deficits.</p>
<p>The German government can only sell of further shares in Deutsche Telekom prior to the year 2000 with the approval of the Telekom management.</p>
