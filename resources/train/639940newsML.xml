<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks end at eight-year lows in thin trade.</title>
<headline>Thai stocks end at eight-year lows in thin trade.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-06-05</dateline>

<p>Thai stocks closed at new eight-year lows on Thursday on sustained sales of bank and finance issues, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index finished 4.82 points off at 548.05 on thin 2.8 billion baht trade. The SET-50 index dipped 0.47 points to 38.55.</p>
<p>&quot;Finance and bank shares were heavily sold in the afternoon. Both sectors led the market decline,&quot; said one broker at a local brokerage house.</p>
<p>Losers outnumbered gainers 213 to 85 with 89 issues staying unchanged.  </p>
<p>Brokers said investors were concerned about financial health of most cash-strapped finance firms which have struggled to cope with a prolonged stock market slump and a sluggish economy.</p>
<p>Siam Commercial Bank led the bank decline after a Standard and Poor's announcement of its negative outlook, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Siam Commercial Bank came under selling pressure today. S&amp;P's comment about its outlook really hurt the stock,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>Siam Commercial lost seven baht to close at 111.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P on Thursday said it assigned a BBB-plus long-term and A-2 short-term counterparty ratings for senior obligations of Siam Commercial's $1.5 billion global medium term note programme. It also gave a BBB long-term rating for its dated subordinated debt.</p>
<p>It said the bank's rating outlook was negative.</p>
<p>The negative outlook reflected S&amp;P's concerns that the economic downturn and resulting asset-quality problems will be higher and more prolonged than anticipated.</p>
<p>Thai Farmers Bank dropped two to 97.50.</p>
