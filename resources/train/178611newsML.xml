<p>Kuwait advised parents against leaving children with domestic help after a 3-1/2 year-old boy was raped by a family driver, an Interior Ministry statement said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;This vicious crime...is the responsibility of trusting, lenient parents...who fail to monitor the behaviour of domestic servants and drivers,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>A ministry official said no further details on the rape case were immediately available.</p>
<p>The statement criticised parents who grant domestic help &quot;the right to care for their children, leaving them with (servants) in the absence of a social role for the family.&quot;</p>
<p>The ministry urged parents against leaving children alone with servants &quot;to avoid exposing them to such acts&quot;.</p>
<p>It is common for Kuwaitis and many foreign residents in the oil-rich state to hire domestic help and drivers. There are more than 200,000 people employed as domestic workers in Kuwait which has a population of about two million.</p>
