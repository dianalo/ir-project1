<headline>U.N. says report lost on Serb war crime suspects.</headline>

<p>A U.N. report that Serb war crimes suspects were working as policemen in northwest Bosnia went astray for more than three months before being discovered, the U.N. police commissioner in Bosnia said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Peter Fitzgerald told reporters that U.N. police officers in the Prijedor area had found out in July that names of three Bosnian Serbs listed on the Serb police duty roster also appear on a list of war crimes suspects.</p>
<p>But the report was not submitted to the U.N. police headquarters in Sarajevo until a few days ago, he said, even though the U.N. police in Prijedor had sent the report to the regional office in Banja Luka shortly after the names matched.</p>
<p>&quot;I sincerely regret that the report made on July 12 was not brought to my notice at that time. This was a genuine mistake on the part of the (U.N.) International Police Task Force,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An October 27 report by the U.N. confirmed employment of a fourth suspect in Omarska police station, some 30 km (18 miles) east of Prijedor.</p>
<p>International officials said on Tuesday that four suspected war criminals wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia were enforcing law and order in the Prijedor area.</p>
<p>The area gained notoriety in 1992 for some of the war's worst atrocities in several detention camps for Moslems and Croats.</p>
<p>The four suspects are wanted by the Tribunal for crimes alleged to have been committed in the camps.</p>
<p>The Tribunal called on Wednesday for the immediate arrest of the four suspects.</p>
<p>The Tribunal described the suspects' employment as police officers as another blatant disregard for international law by the Serb authorities in northwest Bosnia.</p>
<p>NATO's peacekeepers in Bosnia steer clear of &quot;manhunts&quot; to arrest suspects and say they will detain such persons only if encountered in the normal course of their duties. The U.N. police is also not mandated for such action.</p>
<p>Fitzegarld said that he had sent a senior police officer to Prijedor to establish personal identification of the Serb police officers.</p>
<p>The investigation should also reveal &quot;what went wrong with our reporting system that this serious matter was not reported to my headquarters at the time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Fitzerald said that name matching was not enough to establish that Serb policemen were indeed persons wanted by The Hague tribunal.</p>
<p>&quot;Although they are believed to be serving as police officers, there is no (U.N.) police monitor in Prijedor who knows them either by name or by sight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The three officers in the Prijedor police station were reported as Mladen Radic, Miroslav Kvocka and Nedjeljko Timarac. The fourth is Zeljko Mejakic, who's picture is on the war crimes poster.</p>
<p>&quot;We have information that they are there. I have my people inquiring as to the position that they hold...It's a question of getting a clear identification of these people,&quot; Fitzerald said.</p>
<p>He said he had sent a letter to the Serb interior minister asking for the immediate removal, arrest and extradition to The Hague of the police officers.</p>
