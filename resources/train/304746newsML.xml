<p>Farah Inc said on Tuesday that its leased factory in Galway, Ireland, caught fire, which is forcing the company to consider whether it should continue operations in Ireland.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported in the January 5 fire, but certain inventory and manufacturing equipment were damaged in the fire, Farah said.</p>
<p>The company said it believes that its losses are insured, but the company may post a charge up to $2.5 million if it closes its facilities in Ireland.  </p>
<p>No exact cause to the fire has been determined, but faulty machinery is believed to have set the fire, Farah chief financial officer Russell Gibson said.</p>
<p>The Galway facility and Farah's Kiltimagh, Ireland facility produce 45 percent of the garments sold by Farah's U.K. subisidiary, Farah said.</p>
<p>Farah said it has increased commitments with outside contractors to make up for lost inventory.  </p>
<p>The time involved in rebuilding the Galway facility and the impact on the Kiltimagh facility is forcing the company to evaluate its operations in Ireland, Farah said.</p>
<p>Farah said the fire is not expected to have a significant impact on its plans or future operating results.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Farah said it plans to expand its John Henry products at Sears Roebuck &amp; Co as well as its womenswear line.</p>
<p>Also, Farah said, its Australian results have set records in the first quarter, Farah said.</p>
