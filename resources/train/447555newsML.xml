<p>France said on Monday that Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko's health was &quot;a source of concern&quot; in the clearest indication so far that the cancer-stricken ruler's physical condition is declining as fast as his grip on power.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu's health is an additional source of concern in the Zairean crisis,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told a regular briefing, a day after the president was admitted to a hospital in Monaco for more prostate cancer treatment.</p>
<p>As Tutsi rebels led by Laurent Kabila advance relentlessly through eastern Zaire, capturing the third-largest city, Kisangani, virtually without a fight on Saturday, Mobutu has been convalescing from prostate cancer at his luxury French Riviera villa.</p>
<p>A spokesman there said the 66-year-old president was taken to Princess Grace hospital in Monte Carlo on Sunday afternoon for &quot;additional treatment&quot; but suggested he might be released as early as Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The spokesman, Gad Cohen, said he &quot;totally denied&quot; all reports that Mobutu, 66, was in a serious condition.</p>
<p>It was the first time that Mobutu's aides have talked of &quot;treatment&quot; in Monaco. They had described his previous visits to the clinic as being for routine tests.</p>
<p>France is the last outside power to back Mobutu. Foreign Minister Herve de Charette this month called him &quot;undoubtedly the only person capable of contributing to solving the problem&quot;.</p>
<p>It has accused Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi of backing Kabila and tried in vain to mobilise Western powers to intervene militarily, ostensibly to provide relief to Rwandan Hutu refugees trapped by the rebels' advance.</p>
<p>The ragged Zairean army has lost a fifth of the country's territory to the rebels since they launched their offensive last October, with troops looting and retreating.</p>
<p>Kabila has refused United Nations calls for a ceasefire and vowed to go all the way to Kinshasa to &quot;liberate&quot; Zaire.</p>
<p>The rebels, advancing on several fronts, said they were aiming next for the southern mining hub of Lubumbashi, capital of mineral-rich Shaba province. Pweto, 400 km (250 miles) north east of Lubumbashi, fell on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mobutu, one of Africa's longest-serving strongmen, was given a triumphant welcome when he returned to Kinshasa in December by crowds who believed he could save the country from collapse.</p>
<p>But after ordering a counter-offensive, hiring hundreds of white mercenaries and shaking up the army command, he refused to negotiate with the rebels or compromise with his political foes and withdrew to his jungle palace in Gbadolite, about 1,000 km (600 miles) from the capital.</p>
<p>Mobutu, after a second visit to Zaire, returned to France on February 21 for more medical tests and, according to his son and spokesman Mobutu Nzanga, had planned to go home last week. But his departure was delayed.</p>
<p>Before he was taken to hospital on Sunday, an official in his entourage had said Mobutu might return to Zaire later this week but there were no final plans for him to do so.</p>
