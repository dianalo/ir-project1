<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities were largely flat on Tuesday, mostly tracking their Treasury counterparts.</p>
<p>Mortgage experts said that overall, trading was fairly thin amid a quiet afternoon session. Investors were awaiting Wednesday's release of the February consumer price index (CPI), they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll see if CPI confirms or denies (producer prices) from last Friday,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Other than that, there will be a lot of sitting and waiting,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>A market-friendly CPI should keep spreads to Treasuries in a narrow range, said traders.</p>
<p>&quot;We probably will not widen unless something drastic happens in our market,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>However, if consumer prices show a much stronger-than-expected reading, spreads might widen in anticipation of an upward move in short-term interest rates at next Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, he said.</p>
<p>In key coupons, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent paper was unchanged at 99-02/32, yielding 94 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.  </p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues were unchanged as well, at 99-04/32 and 99-10/32, respectively.</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury note was also unchanged at 96-21/32 to yield 6.72 percent.</p>
<p>The February CPI, due Wednesday at 0830 EST/1330 GMT, is expected on average to have advanced a moderate 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent increase in January, according to a Reuters poll of U.S. economists.</p>
