<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Pasminco smelter expansion in jeopardy.</title>

<p>Pasminco Ltd said on Wednesday a proposed expansion of its zinc smelter in Tasmania by about 50 percent was in jeopardy due to negotiations over additional power.</p>
<p>Pasminco has been studying the possibility of lifting annual zinc-making capacity at the Hobart smelter by about 100,000 tonnes to 310,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Recent negotiations so far with the Hydro Electric Commission of Tasmania over supplies additional cheap power have failed to make headway John Winckel, executive general manager of metals for Pasminco told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Cheap hydro-electric power enabled the smelter to operate in the island state of Tasmania, where otherwise it would be too costly given high freight costs, Winckel said.</p>
<p>The only compelling reason to having a smelter in Hobart is to take advantage of the low cost of hydro-electric power,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In almost all other regards, particularly freight, it's not a place to have a smelter.&quot;</p>
<p>Pasminco operates the Rosebury zinc mine in Tasmania, which supplies about half the smelter's raw feed. The rest is shipped in, Winckel said.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for the commission said the negotiations were &quot;proceeding in the proper manner,&quot; but declined to comment on specific details of the talks.</p>
<p>He said Pasminco's current power contract expires this year and that the company was regarded as an important customer.</p>
<p>However, Winckel said the commission has failed to &quot;come to the party&quot; so far over negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can't get a decent number out of the Hobart expansion, we'll put our money elsewhere,&quot; Winckel said.  </p>
<p>Excess zinc concentrates from the Century mine in Queensland, which Pasminco plans to purchase from RTZ-CRA, could potentially supply intermediate concentrates to the Hobart plant, Winckel said.</p>
<p>About half of Century's planned output is already earmarked for Pasminco's Budel smelter in Holland.</p>
