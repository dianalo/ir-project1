<p>Sri Lanka's health ministry on Tuesday denied reports of an outbreak of cholera, saying it was safe for tourists to visit the Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>A ministry statement said several Russian newspapers had reported an outbreak of cholera in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It did not name the Russian newspapers but quoted them as saying that some people diagnosed with cholera in that country had contracted the disease in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&quot;The last case of cholera was reported in Sri Lanka in 1993,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministry of health wishes to inform all persons intending to visit Sri Lanka that there is no danger of contracting the disease in this country,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Tourism is one of the biggest foreign exchange earners for Sri Lanka and the number of tourists visiting the country has risen by about 20 percent in the first few months of this year.</p>
<p>Tourist arrivals dropped by 25 percent in 1996 following the bombing of the Central Bank and a commuter train in Colombo, killing a total of some 160 people.</p>
