<p>Japan's economy grew at a marginal rate in the three months to September after contracting in the previous quarter, the government said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said gross domestic product (GDP) -- a key gauge of the economy's health -- rose a real 0.1 percent in the July-September period from the previous quarter. This translated into a rise of 0.4 percent on an annualised basis, it said.</p>
<p>The EPA said the growth figures, which were better than many economists had expected, confirmed that the Japanese economy was continuing to recover.</p>
<p>GDP, which measures the country's output of goods and services minus net income from overseas production, had fallen a real 0.7 percent in the April-June period from the previous quarter, or 2.9 percent on an annualised basis.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters had been divided over whether the July-September data would show a modest decline or some growth, with forecasts ranging from an annualised fall of 3.8 percent to a rise of 1.2 percent.</p>
<p>The annualised growth rate of 0.4 percent was stronger than the average of analysts' forecasts, which had been for an annualised drop of 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically we knew that the third quarter is going to be weak. But it's good that it's actually slightly positive,&quot; said Jesper Koll of J.P. Morgan in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;Good news. Capital investment expenditure is continuing to drive Japanese economic growth,&quot; Koll told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Particularly weak data would have intensified Japan's debate about the need to spend more out of public coffers to keep the fragile recovery on track. The Finance Ministry is opposed to such a move because it places priority on efforts to reduce the nation's huge budget deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;We have confirmed that the gradual recovery is continuing. This will become clearer in the October-December period,&quot; Economic Planning Agency Vice Minister Shimpei Nukaya told a news conference after the statistics were released.</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible for us to achieve the government forecast of about 2.5 percent growth (in GDP) this fiscal year.&quot;</p>
<p>But despite the growth in the economy, he said he still wanted Japan's central bank to keep its easy monetary policy.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan has kept the nation's key interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent since September last year to nurture the tentative recovery from the slump that followed the bursting of the 1980s &quot;bubble&quot; economy of inflated asset prices.</p>
<p>The EPA said Japan would need 0.63 percent GDP growth in each of the last two quarters of this fiscal year, which ends next March 31, to achieve the 2.5 percent target for the year.</p>
<p>Private consumption fell slightly in the July-September quarter. Public investment also fell in the period while private corporate investment rose, Nukaya said.</p>
