<p>The European Union would insist on human rights clauses in planned trade and cooperation agreements with New Zealand and Australia, despite opposition from both countries, a senior EU diplomat said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've said we can change the wording somewhat, but we will be absolutely insistent we have some reference to human rights,&quot; Aneurin Hughes, European Commission ambassador to Australia and New Zealand, told Reuters in Wellington.</p>
<p>Speaking at a briefing on EU-New Zealand relations, Hughes said he was confident of clinching the accords despite differences over the human rights provisions, which Wellington and Canberra see as superfluous.</p>
<p>On the timing of the accords, Hughes said: &quot;We will start another bout of negotiations in October with both New Zealand and Australia. I very much hope we can still do it more or less in parallel by the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The EU has been making mixed progress on a range of agreements with New Zealand leading up to the proposed framework pact, an umbrella accord on trade and cooperation that would include regular consultation at the top political level.</p>
<p>The two sides have already initialled a mutual recognition agreement on product standards that will make it easier for their manufacturers to export to each other's markets. An accord on veterinary standards is also close to being finalised.</p>
<p>However, they are stalled in separate negotiations on a wine industry agreement, where one stumbling block is protection of geographical names and traditional labels such as 'champagne', 'grand cru' and 'appellation controlee'.</p>
<p>Hughes said the range of proposed agreements with Australia was similar.</p>
<p>The EU insists on human rights clauses in all the framework agreements it signs. Its draft proposals to Australia and New Zealand say both accords are based on mutual respect for the International Declaration on Human Rights, and may be suspended by either side if these are abrogated.</p>
<p>&quot;For us that creates a problem, in the sense we've never signed an agreement which links trade with human rights...It's a question of principle,&quot; a New Zealand Foreign Ministry official said. The EU was showing &quot;no flexibility at all,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Australia also says it prides itself on its human rights record and sees no reason to link the issue with trade.</p>
<p>The EU is New Zealand's second biggest export destination after Australia, accounting for just under 16 percent of total exports and providing its main market for lamb, apples, venison, kiwifruit and wine.</p>
<p>The 15-member EU also is Australia's second largest market for merchandise exports and the largest source of its imports.</p>
