<p>A Mexican priest who cast doubt on whether the country's beloved Virgin of Guadalupe actually appeared in 1531 resigned on Friday as abbot of the holy site where the miracle allegedly took place.</p>
<p>Monsignor Guillermo Schulemburg created an uproar in this fervently Catholic nation when he said in May the virgin's apparition was a symbolic event that never took place.</p>
<p>Many Mexican Catholics called for him to step down.</p>
<p>Schulemburg, however, said his resignation was not related to the controversy he stirred up in a magazine interview.</p>
<p>&quot;It was spontaneous,&quot; Schulemburg said. &quot;It was not due to any pressure, not at any level, not of any kind. At my age (80), I should dedicate myself to other things.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1963, Pope John XXIII gave him the lifelong appointment as abbot of the Basilica de Guadalupe, where according to local beliefs, a dark-skinned virgin appeared before the humble Juan Diego in a miracle considered sacred by Mexicans.</p>
<p>Juan Diego was beatified, a key step toward sainthood, by Pope John Paul in 1990.</p>
<p>Schulemburg said in the interview, published in the local Catholic magazine Ixthus and reprinted by Reforma newspaper, that Juan Diego &quot;is a symbol, not a reality.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said Juan Diego symbolised the marriage of Catholicism and traditional Indian religious beliefs and his beatification had recognised a &quot;cult&quot; and not a real person.</p>
<p>When the uproar would not die down, Schulemburg said his comments had been misinterpreted and said his faith in the miracle remained unwavering.</p>
