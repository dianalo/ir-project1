<p>Hong Kong stocks reversed a strong opening to slide into negative territory on Friday morning on selling of property and property-related shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm still a buyer of this market, but not today,&quot; said Gary Wong, sales director at Vickers Ballas. &quot;Cheung Kong may be set to go to HK$100 but I'm not buying today.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index shed 32 points to 13,166 after leaping nearly 137 points at the open. Turnover was a robust HK$2.18 billion after 30 minutes of trade.</p>
<p>Brokers said that measures aimed at curbing speculation in the property market would have only a short term negative impact. Investors have been worried by the possibility that the government may impose measures to curb speculation in the property market and slow rising prices.</p>
<p>The market opened strongly after overreacting on Thursday to the rising trend in the U.S. long bond yield, one overseas-based broker said. The Hang Seng Index lost 256.82 points to close at 13,198.11 on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the benchmark U.S. 30-year bond finished at 96-25/32, up 1-4/32, to yield 6.75 percent on Thursday, versus Wedneday's closing yield of 6.84 percent, a trend equity markets were more pleased with.</p>
<p>Utilities showed strong gains to lead the market, while properties trended into negative territory. The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index also rebounded 0.94 percent to 1.022 in early trade.</p>
<p>The market was led up in early trade by buying in Hongkong Telecom. The share gained HK$0.70 to trade at HK$13.50 on speculation that Singapore Telecom would be taking a stake in the company.</p>
<p>China Light and Power put on HK$0.30 to HK$33.90, while Hongkong Electric eased HK$0.10 to 26.90, just above Hutchison's general offer price of HK$26.50.</p>
<p>Banking giant HSBC Holdings added HK$1.00 to HK$166.50 and Bank of East Asia climbed HK$0.50 to HK$34.70. Guangdong Kelon led the H share sector with a gain of HK$0.30 to HK$5.60.</p>
<p>Brokers said they were confused as to the short-term outlook for the property sector, but said they had a confident positive long-term view. Developers were hardest hit in early Friday morning trade. New World Development and Cheung Kong both lost HK$0.75 to HK$50.50 and HK$71.50. Henderson Land eased HK$0.50 to HK72.50 and Sun Hung Kai Properties lost HK$0.25 to HK$92.00.</p>
