<p>The Czech National Bank (CNB) said on Monday that it expected turbulance around the Czech crown which will begin to float on Tuesday, and that it was still ready to defend the currency to keep it stable.</p>
<p>&quot;We have liquid funds at our disposal exceeding $10 billion for the support of the crown,&quot; CNB open market operations director Ludek Niedermeyer told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Bank officials at the news conference described the new exchange rate regime announced on Monday as a &quot;controlled float,&quot; but would not elaborate.</p>
<p>The central bank earlier announced that the crown's fluctuation band against a mark/dollar basket would be scrapped from Tuesday, but that the German mark would be &quot;decisive&quot; for the crown's exchange rate. Officials declined to further define what this would mean.</p>
<p>&quot;In the first hours (of Tuesday trading) we expect turbulence. We are ready to support the market, add liquidity,&quot; Niedermeyer said.</p>
<p>Governor Josef Tosovsky said &quot;the central bank will do everything in order to let the stability of the currency be affected as little as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials said the bank would still issue a daily fixing rate for the crown against other currencies, but that would be a service to the public and not a basis for market operations.</p>
<p>After the announcement on floating the crown, the central bank raised its key discount rate to 13 percent from 10.5 percent, indicating that it was still going to keep a tight hold on monetary policy.</p>
