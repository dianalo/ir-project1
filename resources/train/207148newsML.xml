<headline>German cabinet approves hike in pension costs.</headline>

<p>The German cabinet agreed on Thursday to hike pension contributions to record levels to ensure the pay-as-you-go state retirement scheme remains funded in a period of high unemployment and sluggish growth.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's team accepted Social Affairs Minister Norbert Bluem's proposed increase in contributions to 20.3 percent of gross income from 19.2 percent, to take effect from the start of 1997.</p>
<p>The increase must be approved by the Bundesrat upper house of parliament, controlled by opposition Social Democrats (SPD) who have lambasted the government's pension policies.</p>
<p>Germany's pensions scheme is seen by economists as a financial time bomb which -- with the unemployment insurance scheme -- is seen as threatening sustained adherence to the fiscal discipline imposed by European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>Bluem said the increase had been unavoidable. &quot;The economy and jobs market have developed less well than expected in autumn 1995, when the contributions for 1996 were set,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bluem added that financial shortfalls in funding the state pension scheme had been drawn from a special reserve, and this &quot;safety cushion&quot; would have to be restocked next year so that it can cover one month's pension costs.</p>
<p>Most of the increase resulted from topping up the reserve, but 0.2 percent came from a wave of early retirement among Germany's greying population.</p>
<p>Bluem said this trend would be stopped by a law pushing back the retirement age, but added that it would only take hold from 1998 onwards.</p>
<p>The pensions hike comes as a setback to Kohl's efforts to reduce labour overheads, but Bluem said it would have come out even bigger had it not been for austerity measures in the government's current Programme for More Jobs and Growth.</p>
<p>Bluem said more would need to be done to help the pensions system cope with changes in the workplace and in the demographic profile of the population.</p>
<p>&quot;Our pensions system has sufficient capacity for such measures... abandoning its fundamental principles is not open to discussion,&quot; Bluem said.</p>
