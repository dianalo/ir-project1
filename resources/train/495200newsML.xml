<p>An Australian government politician and a recently retired colleague are to be charged with fraud over travel and car entitlements, Attorney-General Daryl Williams said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The charges, against National Party lower house member Michael Cobb and former Liberal upper house member Bob woods, follow police investigations, Williams said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Both men will now be expected to respond to the charges in court,&quot; Williams said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The director of public prosecutions (DPP) today gave notice that summonses are being issued against former Senator Dr Bob Woods and the Member for Parkes, Mr Michael Cobb, in relation to allegations of fraud against the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>&quot;As is usual and appropriate when matters are before a court, none of myself, the AFP (Australian Federal Police) and the DPP will be commenting further pending the hearing of these charges,&quot; Williams said.  </p>
<p>No further details, including likely court dates, were given.</p>
<p>Woods, a senator from New South Wales state, retired from parliament in March, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.</p>
<p>Woods and Cobb, a Member of the House of Representatives for the outback New South Wales seat of Parkes, have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
