<p>UK average earnings probably remained unchanged in March aided by flat pay settlements, but financial sector bonuses and increasing demand for skilled labour are stoking an underlying uptrend, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Reuters consensus poll of forecasts suggests underlying average earnings grew 5.0 percent in March unchanged from February.</p>
<p>The data are due along with April unemployment figures at 0830 GMT on Wednesday. Unemployment is forecast to fall 40,000 in April compared with a 41,000 fall in March.</p>
<p>&quot;With pay settlements showing no signs of accelerating, and the actual rate of average earnings growth falling to 4.1 percent in February, we expect the underlying rate to stick at five percent in March,&quot; said Dharshini David, economist at HSBC.</p>
<p>But bumper bonus payouts from financial institutions presents the upside risk.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very dependent on the number of bonus payments made in March,&quot; said David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders.</p>
<p>Analysts said the picture emerging was of demand for labour pulling earnings higher, particularly in the service sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Recruitment bottlenecks have emerged in both the BCC and PMI surveys, and we expect earnings growth to rise back up to five percent or more later this year,&quot; Deutsche Morgan Grenfell economist James Barty said in a research publication.</p>
<p>Demand for labour in the financial sector is also likely to show up in another sharp decrease in the unemployment rate for April.</p>
<p>However, analysts said the unemployment numbers are still being distorted by the introduction of the job seekers allowance which introduced new, stricter terms for claimants.</p>
<p>&quot;The labour market is tightening, but not to the extent that the figures are showing,&quot; said Schroder's Philpotts. &quot;The growth is confined to quite a small number of sectors.&quot;</p>
<p>He said most of the growth was in the financial services sector where &quot;we are seeing a small re-run of the late 80s.&quot;</p>
<p>Recruitment bottlenecks in recent months and the job seeker's allowance were still partly accountable for the growth trend in the jobs market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is growing at above trend rate at the moment but we're still not anyway near the late 1980s,&quot; said Philpotts.</p>
<p>The growth trend in employment was supported by an increase in the number of full-time workers, analysts said. Previous recoveries have been largely buoyed by an increase in part-time work.</p>
