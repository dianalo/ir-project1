<headline>SOCCER-BRIGHTON FANS WALK OUT AT END OF ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>More than 2,000 Brighton fans staged a non-violent protest during their team's league match against Hereford on Tuesday, by walking out of the game which still had 15 minutes to go.</p>
<p>The fans were protesting about the demise of the club who were in the F.A. Cup final 13 years ago but are now lying 92nd and last in the English League. </p>
<p>Brighton lost 1-0 to stay rooted to the bottom of the third division and the walk-out ended another black day in their recent troubled history.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday they failed in their latest bid to find a temporary home.</p>
<p>Brighton, whose heavily criticised board sold their Goldstone Ground and have to move next May, approached London club Fulham to discuss the possibility of ground-sharing until a proposed new stadium is built in Brighton.</p>
<p>But Fulham, also of the third division, said an agreement with their local council prevented them sharing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sympathetic to Brighton's problems but there's no question of anyone else but Fulham playing at Craven Cottage,&quot; club chairman Jimmy Hill said.</p>
<p>Brighton have recently been in discussion with south coast neighbours Portsmouth about sharing their Fratton Park ground, but Portsmouth have yet to make a decision.</p>
<p>Brighton, who played against Manchester United in the 1983 FA Cup final, are looking increasingly likely to be relegated from the English league into non-League football if they are still in existence next season.</p>
