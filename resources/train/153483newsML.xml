<p>Singapore jet fuel was actively offered at slightly lower prices on Wednesday, while gas oil continued to be well supported as regional demand improves, traders said.</p>
<p>They said four offers were seen at $30.70-$30.75 for mid November lifting fob, slightly under Tuesday's $30.80. Traders said unlike gas oil, jet fuel demand has not picked up substantially except from Indonesia, which bought about 1.5 million barrels for November, and from anticipated Japanese demand for December. Indonesia bought an early November jet fuel cargo from a German trader at 40cents over Singapore quotes c+f.  </p>
<p>Jet fuel demand was also seen from Taiwan which has issued a tender for December arrival which closes November 6.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps slipped to $30.10 for November earlier on weaker crudes and IPE gas oil, before rising to trade at $30.30 and $30.40, 5-10 cents below Tuesday. Physical market remained strong with a Chinese trader offering as high as $30.75 a barrel for Nov 17-21 lifting fob, facing no bids. Traders said Chinese bids were around $235 a tonne c+f, with sellers at $240.</p>
<p>Gasoline slipped on ample supplies. A Thai cargo of 200,000 barrels of 92-octane lifting mid-November was offered displacing earlier talk of no further uncommitted Thai November cargoes.  </p>
<p>Singapore refiners were also heard with remaining November gasoline. But only bids were heard at lower levels from Tuesday's deals with 97-octane bid at $25.65 a barrel for November 23-27 lifting, down from $25.85 and 95-octane bid at $24.80 for November 14-29 lifting, down from $24.90. Regional demand was limited to Taiwan which emerged with its usual requirements - a 250,000 barrel-cargo each of unleaded and leaded 95-octane for delivery December 16-30 and 6-10. The tender closes November 5. But Taiwan cancelled its last tender requirement for December 1-15 delivery due to high international prices. -- Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3084)</p>
