<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss shares end up but below highs.</title>
<headline>Swiss shares end up but below highs.</headline>
<text>
<p>1430 GMT - Swiss shares ended above Monday's close, but fell back from the day's highs after a weaker Wall Street opening, dealers said.</p>
<p>A weaker tendency in the Swiss franc was helpful to industrials while financials were mostly lower, a trader noted. Actively-traded Roche certificates added 60 francs to 9,190.</p>
<p>* Blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) advanced 9.8 points, or 0.27 percent, to to 3,694.2 points.</p>
<p>* Broad Swiss Performance Index (SPI) up 6.24 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,366.90.</p>
<p>* SMI September futures up 6.0 to 3,699.  </p>
<p>Sentiment was described as good after investors seemed to have resigned themselves to the possibility of an interest rate hike in the U.S.</p>
<p>* Among major insurers, which had gained around two percent on Monday, Swiss Re and Zurich were weaker. Swiss Re fell 12 francs to 1,313. Winterthur added five francs to 754.</p>
<p>* UBS gave up five francs to 1,177.</p>
<p>* Nestle rose 10 francs to 1,423 amid some foreign buying ahead of the release of Nestle's half-year profit figures, expected on Friday.  </p>
<p>* CS Holding added 0.25 francs to 124. Dealers said there were rumours that CS may make an offer for Austria's Creditanstalt Bankverein.</p>
<p>Other traders thought an offer unlikely as CS Holding was busy implementing a major restructuring project announced earlier this year.</p>
<p>* Among second-tier shares, Valora recovered from recent losses. Adecco, Jungfaubahn Holding and Globus posted gains.</p>
<p>* Suedelektra was lower after Monday's half-year report.</p>
