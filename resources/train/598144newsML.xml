<headline>Excerpts of White House statement on Burma.</headline>

<p>The following are excerpts from President Clinton's announcement Tuesday imposing economic sanctions against Burma:</p>
<p>&quot;Pursuant to section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208) (the &quot;Act&quot;), I hereby report to the Congress that I have determined and certified that the government of Burma has, after Sept. 30, 1996, committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma.  </p>
<p>&quot;Further, pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703 b) (50 U.S.C. 1631), I hereby report that I have exercised my statutory authority to declare a national emergency to respond to the actions and policies of the government of Burma and have issued an executive order prohibiting United States persons from new investment in Burma.  </p>
<p>&quot;The order prohibits United States persons from engaging in any of the following activities after its issuance:</p>
<p>-- entering a contract that includes the economic development of resources located in Burma</p>
<p>-- entering a contract providing for the general supervision and guarantee of another person's performance of a contract that includes the economic development of resources located in Burma</p>
<p>-- purchasing a share of ownership, including an equity interest, in the economic development of resources located in Burma  </p>
<p>-- entering into a contract providing for the participation in royalties, earnings, or profits in the economic development of resources located in Burma, without regard to the form of the participation</p>
<p>-- facilitating transactions of foreign persons that would violate any of the foregoing prohibitions if engaged in by a United States person</p>
<p>-- evading or avoiding, or attempting to violate any of the prohibitions in the order.  </p>
<p>&quot;Consistent with the terms of section 570(b) of the Act, the order does not prohibit the entry into, performance of, or financing of most contracts for the purchase or sale of goods, services, or technology. For purposes of the order, the term 'resources' is broadly defined to include such things as natural, agricultural, commercial, financial, industrial and human resources.</p>
<p>&quot;However, not-for-profit educational, health or other humanitarian programs or activities are not considered to constitute economic development of resources located in Burma.  </p>
<p>&quot;In accordance with section 570 (b), the prohibition on an activitiy that constitutes a new investment applies if such activity is undertaken pursuant to an agreement, or pursuant to the exercise of rights under an agreement that is entered into  with the government of Burma or a non-governmental entity in Burma, on or after the effective date of the Executive Order.  </p>
<p>&quot;My Administration will continue to consult and express our concerns about developments in Burma with the Burmese authorities as well as leaders of ASEAN, Japan, the European Union, and other countries having major political, security, trading and investment interests in Burma and seek multilateral consensus to bring about democratic reform and improve human rights in that country.</p>
<p>&quot;I have, accordingly, delegated to the Secretary of State the responsibilities in this regard under section 570 (c) and (d) of the Act.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to issue regulations in exercise of my authorities under IEEPA and section 570 (b) of the Act to implement this prohibition on new investment. All Federal agencies are also directed to take actions within their authority to carry out the provisions of the Executive Order....</p>
<p>&quot;In the weeks and months to come, my administration will continue to monitor and assess action on these issues, paying careful attention to the report of the U.N. Special Rapporteur appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Commission and the report of the U.N. Secretary General on the results of his good offices mandate.</p>
<p>&quot;Thus, I urge the regime in Rangoon to cooperate fully with those two important U.N. initiatives on Burma.&quot;</p>
