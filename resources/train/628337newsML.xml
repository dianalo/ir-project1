<p>A Turkish MP announced his resignation from the coalition True Path Party on Friday, robbing the Islamist-led government of its absolute majority in parliament.</p>
<p>True Path deputy Yildirim Aktuna, a former health minister in the government, handed out copies of his resignation letter at a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I will fax it to (True Path leader) Tansu Ciller after this news conference,&quot; said Aktuna, well-known for his anti-Islamist views.</p>
<p>The resignation takes the number of MPs in Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's beleaguered government to 275, one less than the absolute majority needed to win any vote of confidence at the 550-member assembly.</p>
<p>But Erbakan still has a simple majority of two over the secularist opposition. Two seats are vacant.</p>
<p>The government has slowly been falling apart since the powerful army began pushing it in February to crack down on Islamist activism.</p>
<p>Aktuna, the fifth True Path MP to resign in the last week, said still more defections were on the way.</p>
<p>Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, was to meet Ciller later on Friday for talks on possible early elections.</p>
