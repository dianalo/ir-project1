<p>The Colombian government will be looking to build on the $1.3 billion it earned from its privatization program in 1996 by focusing on the energy sector in 1997, a Finance Ministry official said Monday.</p>
<p>The star buys will include stakes in the country's second largest electricity generating company and in one of Latin America's largest open-cast coal mines in northern Guajira province, said Clemente del Valle, head of public credit at the ministry.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are several significant and complex privatizations planned for next year,&quot; Del Valle said. He added, however, that firm dates had not yet been set for the opening of the bidding processes.</p>
<p>The government will be selling its 49 percent stake in Energa de Bogota, the country's second largest generating company which provides 25 percent of the national power supply.</p>
<p>It will also be putting a 57 percent share of Empresa de Energa del Pacfico on the auction block. The company, valued at $500 million, supplies a maximum 850 megawatts of power to 260,000 customers in southwest Colombia.  </p>
<p>Last week, the government, through its Mines and Energy Ministry, reaped a total 949.1 billion pesos with the sell-off of the 1,000 megawatt Chivor and 499 megawatt Betania hydroelectric plants and the sale of a 14.25 percent stake in the gas and oil fired Termocartagena plant.</p>
<p>Three 40 megawatt gas and oil-fired generators currently run by the state oil company Ecopetrol will come under the gavel once again after the Mines and Energy Ministry failed to find a buyer for them last week.  </p>
<p>Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar said recently that he hoped the sweeping privatization of the energy sector would lead Colombia's current generating capacity of 10,000 megawatts to double by the year 2010.</p>
<p>In addition to the power companies, the government will be looking to sell its 50 percent holding in the Cerrejn Zona Norte coal mine in Guajira. The mine, operated jointly with U.S. multinational Exxon Corp, is estimated to contain 921 million metric tonnes of recoverable reserves. Annual production hovers at around 15 million tonnes.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the mining sector, the government will sell its stake in the Cerro Matoso SA nickel plant, the fourth largest producer in the world. Workers bought 2.32 percent of the state's 47.7 percent stake in the nickel giant for 4.17 billion pesos in mid-December. Controlling partner Gencor of South Africa is the favorite to snap up the remaining shares when it is put on the auction block.</p>
<p>The biggest privatization of 1996, meanwhile, was the sale of an 80 percent stake in the Banco Popular bank to Colombian finance magnate Luis Carlos Sarmiento for 271.9 billion pesos. The move made Sarmineto the country's largest individual banker.</p>
