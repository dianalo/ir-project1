<p>The debut of inflation-indexed U.S. bonds and data on December's durable goods orders should garner the attention of bond market participants on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But a selloff from lofty levels in both stocks and bonds late Tuesday had some economists doubting that much forward momentum could be sustained Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The employment cost index provided some relief, but we still have the same basic economic scenario. ... growth and tight labor markets and the risks are to the upside,&quot; said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.  </p>
<p>Durable goods orders were scheduled for release at 830 EST/1330 GMT. Consensus estimates had December orders increasing by 1.2, and excluding defense orders rising by 2.2 percent. In November, both figures declined, by 1.6 percent and 3.4 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Treasury will hold its first sale of $7.0 billion of inflation-indexed securities Wednesday at 1300EST/1800 GMT. Moran looked forward to the sale.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of firms and traders don't know where to bid on these securities and that should make for an interesting learning experience,&quot; Moran said.</p>
