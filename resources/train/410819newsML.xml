<title>NETHERLANDS: ABN AMRO caution not shared by analysts.</title>
<headline>ABN AMRO caution not shared by analysts.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch analysts were prepared to go on Friday where ABN AMRO NV feared to tread by forecasting higher 1997 profits for the Dutch bank.</p>
<p>They expect net profit to grow by between 14 and 16 percent to 3.76-3.84 billion guilders with earnings per share (EPS) rising by between 11 and 13 percent to 10.30-10.50 guilders.</p>
<p>Announcing a 26 percent lift in 1996 net profit on Thursday, ABN AMRO declined to make a forecast for 1997, citing increasing uncertainty about the outlook for financial markets.</p>
<p>Buoyant securities markets contributed to strong growth in commissions and results from financial transactions in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;By giving no '97 outlook, we think ABN AMRO is too conservative,&quot; F van Lanschot Bankiers analyst Jean-Paul van Bavel said in a research note.</p>
<p>He said the first two months of 1997 had been positive, adding that the bank would benefit from the higher dollar, the first contribution from Standard Federal Bancorp and healthy autonomous growth.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO is buying Standard Federal for $1.9 billion.</p>
<p>Van Bavel said 1996 earnings, which rose to 3.30 billion guilders from 2.62 billion in 1995, were pressured by non-recurring provisions of up to 500 million guilders.</p>
<p>He maintained his 1997 EPS estimate of 10.30 guilders although the 1996 EPS figure of 9.26 was below his estimate.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the outlook for the Dutch financial sector remains good and we rate ABN AMRO as an outperformer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Heinie Hakker of BZW said the 1996 results were in line with his expectations, adding that bank officials were reluctant at a briefing today to make a 1997 forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, I find it hard to imagine that 1997 will not show reasonable EPS growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He is forecasting EPS of 10.50 guilders, a rise of 13.4 percent.</p>
<p>Hakker expected low loan loss provisions because of a new system of charging movements to a new fund for general banking risks (FAR) against the profit and loss account.</p>
<p>He said the stronger dollar in 1997 and the high level of provisions in 1996 would also be in the bank's favour.</p>
<p>ING Barings analyst Daan Worm said ABN AMRO was afraid the favourable climate for investment banking that existed in 1996 would change.</p>
<p>But he had allowed for lower results from trading in forecasting a rise in net profit to 3.76 billion guilders and EPS to 10.34 guilders in the current year.</p>
<p>He also said the Dutch group had been conservative in charging a large amount of costs against profits in 1996, indicating the quality of earnings was high.</p>
<p>Hans Pluijgers of Kempen and Co said ABN AMRO would benefit in 1997 from growth in its loan portfolio, U.S. acquisitions, improved market position in Europe and the bulk of costs charged in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;I am mildly positive about the financial markets,&quot; he added. But he said he would have to lower his estimates in the event of a downturn in international markets.</p>
