<p>Singapore gas oil traded lower on Monday in a slow market dominated by sellers while jet fuel values are now almost on par with gas oil, traders said.</p>
<p>Only one 150,000-barrel gas oil cargo was bought by a Singapore trader from a Japanese trader at $25.30 per barrel for May 20-24 lifting free-on-board basis, 20 cents below Friday's traded levels. About 10 offers were seen.</p>
<p>Traders said $25.00 appeared to be a good support level as seen in the swaps market when buyers emerged when prices slipped to that level and was quoted at the end of the day at $25.10/$25.20 for May.</p>
<p>Asian prices could also come under pressure if prices in the West continued to weaken, traders said. On Friday gas oil futures in London lost $5.50 per tonne for May, but was closed on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders also said that the Singapore traders, who have bought over 18 million barrels so far, could suffer losses if prices continued to fall when they have not managed to place all their purchases.</p>
<p>Jet fuel was bid at $25.10 and $25.30 for May 20-24, with a European major intent on selling at $25.10 but nothing was traded.</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) has issued a tender to sell 25,000 tonnes of jet fuel for June 4-6 lifting, which will close on May 9. ADNOC sold the same volume to a US trader in its last tender for May 14-15 lifting at a 25-cent-per-barrel premium to Singapore spot quotes, fob.</p>
