<headline>FDA has some authority over tobacco - U.S. judge.</headline>

<p>A federal judge ruled Friday that the Food and Drug Administration can regulate sales and labeling on cigarettes but cannot regulate the promotion and advertising of tobacco products.</p>
<p>The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge William Osteen appeared to be a mixed one for the tobacco industry and anti-smoking forces. The U.S. tobacco industry had challenged new curbs on advertising and marketing of cigarettes imposed by federal regulators as unconstitutional.  </p>
<p>Osteen heard arguments in February that the FDA had overstepped its authority and was violating U.S. free-speech guarantees with its new rules limiting the sale and advertising of cigarettes. His ruling may be appealed.</p>
<p>The battle dates back to August 1995, when President Bill Clinton authorised the FDA to regulate how cigarettes are sold and marketed in a bid to curb smoking by children.</p>
<p>The FDA rules would ban free samples and billboard ads near schools and playgrounds, limit vending machine sales, ban sponsorship of sports events and the use of cigarette brands on hats, T-shirts and other products.</p>
<p>The rules would also restrict ads in some publications and require retailers to see photo identification for cigarette purchasers under age 27. Some of the rules took effect in February and others were to take effect later this year.</p>
