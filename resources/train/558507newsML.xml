<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian wages growth &quot;a little high&quot; - Costello.</title>
<headline>Australian wages growth &quot;a little high&quot; - Costello.</headline>

<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Sunday that wages data released last week showing 4.6 percent annual growth were &quot;a little high&quot; for both the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the government.</p>
<p>While inflation was not a barrier to interest rate cuts, wages needed to be watched carefully, Costello said in a television interview on the Seven network when asked about the outlook for interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got inflation under control, that is no longer a barrier,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>&quot;But to keep it under control it's important that we are actively vigilant on the wages front,&quot; he said, adding that was why the average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) numbers released last week were important.</p>
<p>The data showed AWOTE rose 1.3 percent in the three months to February, and were 4.6 percent higher over the year, the strongest annual growth since the year to November 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;They were a little high I think for the Reserve (Bank) and us,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>Economists see 4.5 percent as the RBA's limit on wages growth, beyond which it then becomes a threat to low inflation.  </p>
<p>With the rise in the consumer price index running at 1.3 percent in the year to March, Costello said there was no need for wages to chase prices, and the public should realise they could improve their financial position with increases of up to four percent.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what people should be thinking about. And the bonus of those sorts of wages outcomes is that we can get relief on the interest rate front as well -- we can have it both,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>For that reason it was foolish to seek larger claims, &quot;because in the end all that will happen is it will be taken out of your back pocket on the interest rates,&quot; Costello said.</p>
