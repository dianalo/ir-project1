<p>World Trade Organisation Director-General Renato Ruggiero has voiced confidence that ministers from around the globe meeting next week can give a major push to a further opening of international markets.</p>
<p>In a letter to Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong, who will chair the WTO's first-ever Ministerial Conference, Ruggiero acknowledged the gathering must make some difficult decisions on controversial issues.</p>
<p>But he said negotiations in Geneva over the past few weeks on a declaration to be issued by the ministers from the 125 WTO member states had provided a &quot;solid basis&quot; for accord in Singapore on its text.</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident that the Declaration which emerges will be one in which all WTO members can take pride,&quot; Ruggiero wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Declaration, to be a key text guiding the two-year-old body towards the end of the century, would be one &quot;in which all WTO members can reaffirm their commitment to the great shared undertaking that is the multilateral trading system,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The conference, formally the WTO's supreme authority, opens on Monday and the Declaration is due to be issued when it wraps up five days later on December 13.</p>
<p>But before it can be completed, ministers must decide how it will handle trade and labour, investment, competition policy and government procurement -- the so-called &quot;new issues&quot; developing countries are determined to exclude from the WTO agenda at this stage.</p>
<p>In his letter to Yeo, Ruggiero recognised that no consensus had been found on these issues among missions to the WTO headquarters in Geneva and that differences remained on some other points.</p>
<p>The United States, backed by a major international labour union grouping currently holding its general assembly in Singapore, is arguing loudly for the trade body to take on board at least the possibility of working towards a &quot;social clause.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. Acting Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, a senior European Union official representing Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, and Ruggiero are due to address the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions on Sunday.</p>
<p>The EU is split on the labour issue, with France and Belgium firmly behind Washington but Germany, Britain and Spain -- all with conservative governments -- opposed.</p>
<p>Ruggiero himself, although he has avoided public comment, is believed to consider the issue too divisive and could harden the positions of developing countries in other areas -- like investment -- where some are more flexible.</p>
<p>But WTO officials strongly denied that the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Michel Hansenne, who has indicated support for a trade-and-labour link, had been barred from the Singapore meeting.</p>
<p>An ILO official in Geneva said on Friday Hansenne had been invited to speak but had then had the invitation withdrawn after developing countries objected.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hansenne himself asked if he could speak, as did several other international organisations who only have observer status with the WTO,&quot; one WTO official in Singapore said.</p>
<p>&quot;Consultations among members showed there was no support for any of them speaking -- the agenda is already crowded with so many ministers due to speak. Mr Hansenne was advised accordingly. There was no question of 'uninviting' him, and he is still welcome to come.&quot;</p>
