<p>CBOT soybean futures ended sharply lower on Monday as funds sold at least 25 million bushels amid bleak demand prospects, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the trade gained a little bit of confidence that we've reached a level where demand is going to slow down with competition from South America,&quot; said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities. &quot;We'll find out Thursday on our export sales and crush reports.&quot;</p>
<p>Brazilian soybeans were priced at $300.20 per tonne FOB Paranagua for April shipment while U.S. supplies were quoted at $313.80 per tonne, FOB U.S. Gulf, export sources said.</p>
<p>Traders said high prices were also slowing domestic demand. They pointed to news Friday that Cargill Inc's processors in Kansas City, Guntersville and Norfolk would be shutting down temporarily this summer due to poor margins.</p>
<p>Weak stopping of deliveries posted against the March pressured nearbys, said Mark Cermak of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>&quot;March beans dragged everything down,&quot; Cermak said. &quot;There's a million (bushels) beans bouncing around and nobody wants them.&quot;</p>
<p>Soybeans closed 25 to 6-1/4 cents per bushel lower with May down 24-1/2 at $8.25.  </p>
<p>Cash basis levels continued to weaken, confirming declining demand. The basis in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was at 17 cents under the May on Monday, down eight cents from the previous Monday, cash sources said.</p>
<p>Three Cargill Inc soybean processing plants were scheduled for down-time this summer, a Cargill spokeswoman said Friday. That move was expected to further cut into domestic demand for soybeans and contributed to declining basis levels, floor sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The basis around here confirms there's plenty of grain in the pipeline nearby,&quot; U.S. Commodities' Roose said.</p>
<p>The May contract closed below the four-day moving average but well above the 20-day and moving average signals remained positive despite Monday's sharp slide, chartists said. Resistance was pegged at $8.44-3/4 per bushel in the May with first support at $8.13-1/4.</p>
<p>Funds were noticeably absent in morning trade but were aggressive sellers by midday. Traders said Cargill Investor Services sold seven million bushels May while Refco Inc sold two million May and 1.5 million July. Rosenthal Collins and Griffin Trading each sold 2.5 million May.</p>
<p>In options trade, Goldenberg-Hehmeyer bought 500 May $8.50 calls at 31 cents and sold 1,000 May $9.00 calls at 15 cents. Cargill Investor Services bought 500 November $7.00 puts at 38 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated by CBOT at 86,000 contracts, compared with Friday's actual volume of 78,703 contracts.</p>
