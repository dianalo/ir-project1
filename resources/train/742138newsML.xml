<title>SOUTH AFRICA: SAFRICA LABOUR MINISTER TO COMPLETE TERM OF OFFICE.</title>
<headline>SAFRICA LABOUR MINISTER TO COMPLETE TERM OF OFFICE.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-07-21</dateline>

<p>Labour Minister Tito Mboweni would complete his full term of office up to the next general election in 1999, a labour ministry spokesperson said on Monday.</p>
<p>She was reacting to a newspaper report that Mboweni would quit his post next year, possibly taking up a full-time position within the ruling African National Congress (ANC).</p>
<p>&quot;He won't be leaving before his term of office is over,&quot; the spokesperson told Reuters.</p>
<p>Mboweni on Friday told journalists that he was considering his options after his term of office ended in 1999, but shrugged off suggestions that he could join the private sector.</p>
<p>He indicated that he was more inclined towards a full-time position within the ANC but did not elaborate further.</p>
<p>Mboweni has over past months tried to move labour and business closer to each other over controversial proposed new labour legislation.</p>
<p>The Basic Conditions of Employment Bill is due to be tabled in parliament by September 15 but so far there has been little agreement between labour and business over key issues including a reduced working week, maternity leave provisions and Sunday work pay.</p>
<p>The labour ministry is currently involved in bilateral discussions with both parties in an effort to reach consensus well ahead of the September 15 deadline.</p>
