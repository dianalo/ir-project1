<p>China has thrown open the doors to its defence industry to foreign investors in an about turn aimed at ensuring it has the high-tech weaponry needed to fight battles of the future, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Commanders of its backward but secretive defence sector, drawing lessons from the Gulf War, have endorsed a plan to let foreign companies join in defence electronics projects next year -- rather than fall even further behind.</p>
<p>&quot;China has learned the lessons of the Gulf War and that is to adopt high technology,&quot; said a defence analyst who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Beijing announced on Sunday it wanted foreign investors to lend a hand in its defence electronics industry, adding that the sector should no longer be veiled in secrecy.</p>
<p>It highlighted an endorsement of the policy shift from Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission and a leader who has long been linked to modernisation of the armed forces.</p>
<p>China's armed forces have turned to a leaner -- but meaner -- fighting machine since the 1991 Gulf War shocked military planners with the devastating, long-range firepower of aircraft and cruise missiles.</p>
<p>They have trimmed the ranks of the now three-million-strong People's Liberation Army, but have stepped up spending on defence weaponry.</p>
<p>Overall spending in the published defence budget will rise by 14.7 percent this year to $9.7 billion. That is widely believed to be only a portion of real defence spending.</p>
<p>Beijing has also shown a willingness to demonstrate its firepower -- as it did with war games and missile tests off Taiwan last year -- alarming its Asian neighbours and even the United States.</p>
<p>But analysts said despite the occasional outbursts of sabre rattling, China had a long way to go to modernise its armed forces.</p>
<p>&quot;China's defence forces are backward but with pockets of excellence,&quot; said a military analyst in Beijing.</p>
<p>Those pockets of excellence now include substantial doses of Russian hardware and military technology, introduced as relations between the two former communist rivals improve and Moscow searches for hard cash.</p>
<p>Beijing has already added Russian missile components to its own home-grown missile programme and has beefed up its air force with Russian Su-27 fighters as well as advanced engine technology, analysts said.</p>
<p>Its fleet of some 100 diesel-powered submarines -- with only 1950s technology -- has been strengthened by two Russian Kilo class submarines, a recently commissioned, domestically-developed Song class conventional submarine and five nuclear submarines, analysts said.</p>
<p>China was also looking to add punch to its ship-mounted missile defence systems to extend their range from 15 km to 40 km (nine to 25 miles).</p>
<p>But Beijing has been forced to bring in its new weaponry into an obsolete communications system, and that appears to be the focus of the latest drive, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The electronics sector of communist China's military is its weakest area by far. It has to absorb technology from Western countries if it wants to bring its military into the modern age,&quot; said an analyst in Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now it is far, far behind the system of Taiwan, which has been getting significant foreign help for years.&quot;</p>
<p>That view is widely shared.</p>
<p>&quot;They need a system that can provide rapid and highly reliable communications between headquarters and commanders in the field,&quot; said a Western defence analyst in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;That could be where the foreigners come in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But China's drive to modernise its forces still faces a huge hurdle with curbs imposed by the West after the bloody crackdown on dissent in Beijing in 1989.</p>
<p>Analysts said that accusations that Beijing has diverted to military use U.S.-produced computers purchased by civilian companies has made the curbs an even more difficult obstacle to overcome.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to see Western companies helping the Chinese develop a new super class of missiles anytime soon,&quot; said a foreign analyst.</p>
