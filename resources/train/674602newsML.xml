<headline>Indonesia rupiah lower, swaps up on Thai spillover.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-06-19</dateline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was lower against the dollar and swap premiums increased in late trading on Thursday following a spillover of the crisis in Thailand.</p>
<p>Dealers said volume was modest, but the underlying tone had turned biddish on the dollar, aided by relatively ample domestic liquidity.</p>
<p>Thai's finance and commerce ministers resigned on Thursday, sparking a slew of unloading of regional currencies, including the rupiah. Offshore investors continued to overborrow the rupiah, fearing the central bank might take action to control the swap market.  </p>
<p>Offshore purchases lifted the dollar through the 2,430 barrier, but further rises were limited by local selling.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said short dollar covering ahead of the weekend was also among the factors which caused the softening.</p>
<p>He said the dollar upturn could not maintain for very long because operators would need more rupiah due to the month-end factor and half-year book closing.</p>
<p>&quot;There could be some window-dressing approaching the six-month reports. People would need more rupiah,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,430.75/31.00 at 0845 GMT against an opening 2,427.75/28.50.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,430.25/30.50 and 2,428.0/28.3, respectively.</p>
<p>Overnight rupiah was at seven percent. Overnight swaps were at 0.25/0.30 and tom/next at 0.3/0.5 points.</p>
<p>One-month swaps edged up to 13.75/14.25 from 13.50/14.00, two to 29.5/30.5 from 27.5/29.5, three to 42.00/42.25 from 41.0/42.0 and six to 82.0/83.0 from 81.0/82.0 points.</p>
<p>The central bank raised its intervention band by one point to 2,423/2,615 and its conversion band also by one point to 2,423/2,471 on Thursday.</p>
