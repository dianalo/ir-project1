<title>GERMANY: Main German parties slip in local state election.</title>
<headline>Main German parties slip in local state election.</headline>

<p>Both Germany's main parties, Christian Democrats (CDU) and Social Democrats (SPD), lost ground in local elections in the northern state of Lower Saxony, preliminary official results released on Monday showed.</p>
<p>Big winners across the state in Sunday's vote were the environmentalist Greens, who leapt to 9.0 percent from 6.3 percent in the previous round of local elections in 1991.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU, which has just pushed a tough package of cuts in welfare spending and employee benefits through the Bonn parliament, fell 1.4 points to 41.6 percent.</p>
<p>The SPD, who rule alone in the Lower Saxony state government under popular local chairman Gerhard Schroeder, fell 1.6 points to 38.5 percent.</p>
<p>The centrist Free Democrats (FDP), junior members of Kohl's coalition cabinet in Bonn, fell 1.2 points to 4.6 percent.</p>
<p>Christian Wulff, chairman of the CDU in Lower Saxony, said he was satisfied with the result, although premature talk in Bonn of plans to reform taxes and speculation that pensions might have to be cut had cost his party core voters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still easily the biggest party in the state at local level, the SPD took the biggest loss of all the parties,&quot; he told national ARD television.</p>
<p>The SPD has failed nationwide to make substantial gains on the back of the government's austerity programme.</p>
<p>Herbert Schmalstieg, the ruling SPD mayor in the state capital Hanover who faces a run-off against a CDU candidate to keep his job, saw problems for his party above all in the rise of the Greens.</p>
<p>&quot;In all the big cities...SPD and Greens together have a majority, and the SPD lost ground everywhere, and lost ground substantially, in favour of the Greens,&quot; he told regional NDR television.</p>
<p>&quot;In the long term the SPD can't be happy that, on the one hand, a majority exists (for left-of-centre parties) but that on the other hand the majority is only maintained thanks to the SPD losing ground and the Greens gaining.&quot;</p>
<p>The leftist Greens for the first time put up candidates in all the state's municipalities and communes.</p>
<p>Surveys showed they also benefited more strongly than other parties from the lowering of the voting age in Lower Saxony to 16 years from 18, the first time this has happened in Germany.</p>
<p>The Greens are usually seen as the most natural coalition partner for the SPD to try to regain power in Bonn, where Kohl's centre-right coalition has ruled for 14 years.</p>
<p>But senior SPD figures have noted the danger that, if they become too closely associated with the Greens, they only lose ground to the environmentalists while failing to gain ground in the political centre.</p>
