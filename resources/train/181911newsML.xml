<p>Britain headed for a new showdown with its European Union partners on Tuesday, threatening to veto reforms crucial for the bloc's expansion unless they agreed to overturn a law limiting the EU working week to 48 hours.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major fired off a letter to European Commission President Jacques Santer and fellow EU leaders minutes after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that Britain must obey the controversial Working Time Directive.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unacceptable and must be remedied,&quot; Major wrote.</p>
<p>He said introducing laws that would shackle Britain's flexible labour market was counter to the spirit of the opt-out he won from Social Chapter legislation during negotiations on the Maastricht treaty on economic and political union in 1991.</p>
<p>Major said he would demand treaty changes at the Inter- Governmental Conference (IGC), due to end next year, which is discussing how to adapt the EU's institutions so the 15-nation bloc can expand to take in new members from eastern Europe.</p>
<p>He said he would use his veto to block a conclusion to the IGC unless the Maastricht treaty was amended to prevent workplace laws being introduced &quot;through the back door&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not see how new agreements can be reached if earlier agreements are being undermined,&quot; Major, who brought EU business to a virtual standstill for several weeks earlier this year in a row over mad cow disease, told his fellow leaders.</p>
<p>Major later clashed in parliament with opposition Labour leader Tony Blair in a sign that the issue could become a big factor in Britain's general election, due by May.</p>
<p>Although Labour has moved closer to the Conservatives on many aspects of European policy, it strongly backs the 48-hour week and would sign the Social Chapter.</p>
<p>Major, by contrast, plans to fight for re-election on the claim that flexible markets have turned Britain into the &quot;enterprise centre of Europe&quot;, enabling it to cut unemployment and attract the bulk of foreign investment into the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;Britain wants good jobs, not worthless directives,&quot; Major said in parliament. &quot;We cannot agree that our competitiveness should be undermined in this way.&quot;</p>
<p>A prominent pro-European member of the ruling Conservative party, Edwina Currie, criticised Major's tactics. &quot;Thumping the table in Europe is childish, petulant and useless,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>But Major will have paid more notice to complimentary comments made by anti-European &quot;Euro-sceptics&quot; whose carping has dogged his six years as prime minister. Papering over cracks in his party is crucial if Major is to have any chance of overhauling Labour's commanding lead in the opinion polls.</p>
<p>The ECJ ruled that Britain must comply with the working time directive because the Commission had been right to introduce it under European health and safety provisions, which allowed Britain to be outvoted by its European partners.</p>
<p>Britain had appealed to the Luxembourg court, arguing that the issue has nothing to do with health and safety.</p>
<p>EU Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn criticised Britain for &quot;threatening to hold the IGC to ransom&quot; and defended the directive as an essential health and safety measure.</p>
<p>Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang said it could cost British industry as much as two billion pounds ($3.31 billion) a year to implement the directive, which also guarantees rest periods and holidays.</p>
<p>But trade unions saluted the ruling and the TUC umbrella body said three affiliated unions were preparing test cases in the event of the government refusing to implement the directive. ($1=.6050 Pound)</p>
