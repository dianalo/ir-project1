<p>British hopeful Tim Henman will put his rapidly improving game to the test on Friday night in a third- round showdown with Australian Open second seed Michael Chang.</p>
<p>Henman, carrying the hopes of a success-starved nation after his quarter-final appearance in Wimbledon last year, is looking to do even better at Melbourne Park but must first beat Chang at one of the world number two's favourite venues.</p>
<p>Billed as the day's biggest centre court attraction, the match will pit the two players against each other for the first time and give Henman a chance to build on the promising form which has him leading the 1997 win lists.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Briton is on a high after beating world number four Goran Ivanisevic on the way to winning the tournament in Sydney last week.</p>
<p>So too is Chang, who beat world number one Pete Sampras in an exhibition match last weekend, though he was not completely content with his first two victories here.</p>
<p>Chang, a finalist here last year, has not tasted grand slam success since winning the French Open as a 17-year-old in 1989.</p>
<p>In other matches, seventh seed Thomas Enqvist, Sweden's flagbearer after the retirement of Stefan Edberg, will fight to turn the tide of history when he meets Spain's Sergi Bruguera in a third round encounter on centre court.</p>
<p>Bruguera has won all their three previous matches.</p>
<p>Women's world number one Steffi Graf should have no trouble in her seemingly predestined march to the Open final. She plays Argentina's Ines Gorrochategui, ranked 97 places below her, for a place in the final 16.</p>
