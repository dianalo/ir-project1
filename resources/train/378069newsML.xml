<p>The Budapest Stock Exchange's index fell two percent on Friday following the release of a mixed batch of corporate results, traders said, adding that a general upwards movement on world markets had little effect.</p>
<p>The market had been biting its nails in the last few days over oil and gas company MOL's 1996 results but the company's better-than-expected figures failed to make up for other companies' disappointing performances, notably chemicals maker TVK.</p>
<p>The BUX index closed at 5,520.40 points, down 115.59, while futures tumbled for all maturities by between 181 and 285 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of worse-than-expected earnings reports exceeded the number of better-than-expected reports and the market began to panic,&quot; said Kalman Schuszter of New York Broker Budapest. &quot;Those with good figures were influenced by other (poor performers).&quot;</p>
<p>MOL surprised the market, reporting an IAS consolidated net income of 22.2 billion forints in 1996 against 1.1 billion in 1995, and consequently jumped to 3,320 forints before later coming down to close at 3,195, up 100.</p>
<p>&quot;MOL came out with extremely good results, but mainly TVK had such weak figures that it dragged the market down with it,&quot; Schuszter said. TVK tumbled 16 percent to close at 2,200 forints, down 420.</p>
<p>&quot;The link between TVK's fall and the results is evident,&quot; one trader said earlier today. &quot;Nevertheless, I don't fully understand why it's falling so sharply as expectations of its results were not very good anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the market many companies which published their 1996 figures moved downward.</p>
<p>Chemicals Borsodchem fell almost five percent to close at 6,040, down 310, while pharmaceuticals Egis dropped 450 forints or more than four percent to end at 10,400 forints, even if its figures were in line with expectations of many.</p>
<p>Home improvement product maker Graboplast, which published figures on Thursday afternoon, bucked the trend and closed at 7,795 forints, up 75. Traders said the group's figures were good but the rise was limited by the fact that expectations were already factored in.</p>
<p>&quot;Expectations were good but I think Graboplast's price already reflects the results,&quot; one trader said earlier.</p>
<p>Despite the market's fall on Friday, Schuszter was optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;There were companies which performed well in 1996, so there's no reason to say that the profitability of Hungarian companies fell,&quot; he said.</p>
