<title>MALAYSIA: Defence officials seen joining Asia security talks.</title>
<headline>Defence officials seen joining Asia security talks.</headline>

<p>Defence officials for the first time will join the annual security talks the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) holds with Asian and Western powers, diplomats said at the weekend.</p>
<p>Asia's premier security conference brings together ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- and key powers and trading partners, including Australia, the United States, Russia, China, Japan, India, the European Union, South Korea, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Senior officials of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), who met this week in Malaysia's resort island of Langkawi, agreed to invite defence officials at the 21-member grouping's annual meeting in July.</p>
<p>The talks have always taken place at the foreign ministers' level. A proposal, adopted unanimously in Langkawi, would allow senior defence officials to join the meeting, one Western diplomat who attended the Langkawi meeting said.</p>
<p>&quot;ARF is supposed to be a forum about security but there's never been any security officials at the meetings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>If foreign ministers of the member countries adopt the recommendation, as expected, defence officials would join the next ARF ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur on July 27, an Asian diplomat said.</p>
<p>The ARF was set up four years ago as a way to eventually solve potential conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is supposed to evolve through three stages, from discussion of issues to preventive diplomacy and finally to conflict resolution.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now we're between step one and step two,&quot; the Western diplomat said. &quot;We're groping toward preventive diplomacy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some countries are enthusiastic about ARF being more than a talk shop and having real clout in settling disputes. Others are extremely reluctant to go forward in that way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China, which has several territorial disputes with countries in the region over islands in the South China Sea, is adamantly opposed to allowing ARF -- and by extension the United States and Europe -- a role in settling disputes.</p>
<p>Cambodia, Laos and Burma -- expected to join ASEAN this year -- are also ARF members and so is Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The forum broke new ground last year when Western members raised the issue of Burma's oppression of a pro-democracy movement led by nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi at the conference, despite ground rules that generally ban discusssion of another country's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Burma's latest swoop against democracy campaigners almost certainly will be raised at the coming meeting, diplomats said.</p>
<p>China's disputes over the Spratlys -- a string of islands and atolls in the South China Sea believed to contain oil and minerals -- could also get an airing at ARF.</p>
<p>The Chinese, at a meeting with ASEAN officials last month, agreed to discuss the competing claims with ASEAN as a group. Previously, Beijing had insisted on bilateral discussions.</p>
<p>&quot;They say that one day and the next day they're sending boats to Mischief Reef,&quot; one diplomat said, referring to a Spratly island claimed by China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>China and Taiwan claim all of the Spratlys, while ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam claim parts of them.</p>
