<headline>Arafat says he expects Israel to close tunnel.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1996-09-29</dateline>

<p>President Yasser Arafat said Palestinian anger would fade if Israel closed a controversial tunnel but he did not want to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unless it would advance the peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;The closing of the tunnel would show prudent judgment. We expect the situtation at the tunnel to go back to the way it was. Then the storm will fade,&quot; he told Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper in an interview published on Sunday.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the tunnel, showing ancient ruins revered by Jews but running near Islamic sites, 55 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died in clashes.</p>
<p>Arafat said he was ready to meet Netanyahu one-on-one if Israel closed the tunnel and set a timetable for implementing Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. But he said there was no point in a meeting for the sake of meeting.</p>
<p>Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli police on Sunday at the reopening of the tourist tunnel near the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site. The tunnel had been closed for two days for the Jewish sabbath.</p>
<p>Israeli workmen last week punched a second entrance in the tunnel, saying it would allow more visits. The opening prompted Palestinian protests and international condemnation.</p>
<p>Netanyahu accused Arafat of &quot;cynically&quot; exploiting the tunnel issue. Palestinians called the opening an Israeli attempt to &quot;Judaise&quot; Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Arafat said Netanyahu -- elected in May on a promise to take a hard line on Israeli security -- had &quot;hurled a bomb&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The conflict between us is political,&quot; Arafat said. &quot;When the religious element is added, it's hard to control the situation. Does Netanyahu know this?&quot; Arafat said in the interview conducted on Saturday.</p>
<p>He denied charges by some Israeli politicians that Palestinian police were ordered to fire on Israeli soldiers: &quot;When our police opened fire, it was only because they felt endangered and protected themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>He said his police had been armed to fight violent opponents of the peace process and maintain order. &quot;What would they have us arm it (the police) with -- toy pistols?&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat said Netanyahu had proposed in a phone call from Germany, where the Israeli leader was on an official visit last week, that they meet together with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>The Palestinian leader said he was ready for such a meeting, even if it included American and European officials.</p>
<p>He brushed aside Netanyahu's assertion that earlier meetings Netanyahu and other Israeli cabinet ministers held with him amounted to progress.</p>
<p>&quot;With Netanyahu everything begins and ends with a meeting. I hope the situation will change. I propose a challenge to Netanyanu: to make public the protocol of our meeting, and then everybody will know that the meeting didn't move us forward,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
