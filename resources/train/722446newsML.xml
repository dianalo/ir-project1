<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle trade on Friday was extremely slow at $62.00 per cwt, unchanged from Thursday, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 100 heifers that would likely grade select and choice sold in Kansas. There were no reported sales in the Panhandle, they said.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices rebounded Thursday from a low of $61.00 to $61.50 on Wednesday to close the week at the same price it began on Monday.</p>
<p>Prices were underpinned Thursday by stronger than expected packer demand and sharply higher CME live cattle futures.  </p>
<p>Showlists in the Panhandle were sold out at most feedlots, with a weekly movement of 113,500, well above the estimated showlist of 103,000. Weekly sales in Kansas were near 92,500 head, slightly over the showlist of 91,000, the sources said.</p>
<p>Strong packer buying was linked to brisk beef sales this week, they said. Beef moement this week totaled 1,281 fabricated loads, compared with 707 during the previous holiday shortened week, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>Outlooks for continued strong beef demand next week sparked optimism among feedlot operators who said owners would most likely price cattle at $65.00 early next week.</p>
