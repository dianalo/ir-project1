<p>India's Congress party on Sunday said it was formally staking its bid to form a new federal government.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday Congress said it was withdrawing support for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 15-group United Front coalition government, which has held power for just nine months.</p>
<p>&quot;I met the President (Shankar Dayal Sharma) today and told him that we are withdrawing support to the United Front government and I also staked our claim to form a government,&quot; Congress president Sitaram Kesri told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have told the president that the support we had extended to the government on the hope that they will support secular forces which has not come about so we are withdrawing our support,&quot; Kesri added.</p>
<p>Ghulam Nabi Azad, a senior Congress party official told reporters: &quot;The Congress party is not in favour of any fresh elections. The Congress parliamentary party has requested the party president (Kesri) to formally write to the president to stake the party's claim.&quot;</p>
