<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shekel unchanged against dollar.</title>

<p>The shekel closed unchanged against the dollar in very thin trading as the market awaited the Bank of Israel's interest rate announcement later on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was quiet and mixed today as investors wait for the interest rate announcement. The market expects the central bank will lower the rate by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point,&quot; said a dealer at Bank Hapoalim.</p>
<p>The central bank's key lending rate now stands at an annualised 15.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Only a cut of more than 0.5 percentage point will have a real impact on trading. During the day trading was very volatile because volume was low and every deal moved the market,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.2470 shekels, unchanged from Friday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, closed at 3.6551 shekels against 3.6662 on Friday.</p>
<p>On the crosses the shekel traded against the yen at 2.8889 shekels per 100 yen against 2.9181 on Friday and against the mark at 2.1450 shekels against 2.1654 on Friday.</p>
<p>In late afternoon the dollar was trading at 3.2440 shekels.</p>
