<headline>Use of SLGS as hedge is an &quot;abuse&quot; - U.S. official.</headline>

<p>Municipal bond market players that use State and Local Government Series securities, or SLGS, as a hedge are engaging in an &quot;abuse&quot; of the program, a top Treasury Department official warned on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to clarify that this is an abuse,&quot; said Roger Anderson, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, in the agency's strongest statement to date on the issue. He added, however, that Treasury has no plans of folding the program.  </p>
<p>Treasury last October issued final regulations designed to make the SLGS program easier and less costly for state and local governments that want to refinance and invest proceeds from tax-exempt bonds.</p>
<p>Recently, municipal market participants warned Anderson that a loophole in the revised program could lead to abuses by localities if uncorrected.</p>
<p>Their April 29 letter told Anderson he could effectively cure the problem by stating publicly that Treasury will reject any SLGS applications where the applicant intends to use the securities for an interest rate option or hedge.  </p>
<p>&quot;SLGS were created to help tax-exempt issuers comply with the arbitrage restrictions,&quot; Anderson said in a speech at a Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We put a lot of effort into making them more attractive and easier to use. But subsidizing speculation is not one of our goals,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Anderson said Treasury officials discussed whether the agency should continue to allow tax-exempt bond issuers to put open market Treasuries into escrow accounts. But the decision was made that &quot;we are not going to prohibit that,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Anderson said Treasury explored whether to let bond firms use SLGS for hedging under some circumstances. &quot;If we could be paid for this option maybe we could permit it, but we haven't figured out how to do that yet,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
<p>Anderson outlined two scenarios that Treasury does not consider improper use of SLGS.</p>
<p>He said currently the subscription deadline, depending on the size of the subscription, is either five or seven days before settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;If an issuer subscribes for SLGS earlier, say 15 days before settlement, and there's negative arbitrage in the escrow, and then 10 days before settlement the SLGS rates have gone up, there's nothing to prevent that issuer from canceling that earlier sub and resubscribing at the higher rate,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's also permissible for an issuer with an existing escrow of open markets to sell those open markets and subscribe to SLGS, as long as the transactions happen at the same time,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
