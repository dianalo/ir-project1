<title>USA: US mortgage-backeds slump in line with Treasuries.</title>

<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-16</dateline>

<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities slipped in line with Treasuries on Wednesday, falling as much as 7/32 in current coupons by late afternoon.</p>
<p>Yield spreads between current coupons and Treasuries widened by a whisker after a brief rally that followed the release of a key inflation gauge, said a New York-based trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Yield spreads widened after Treasuries got a little push from consumer prices earlier in the day,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The September Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose an overall 0.3 percent, in line with a Reuters poll.  </p>
<p>The core CPI, which excludes food and energy price fluctuations, also rose 0.3 percent in line with average forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend is that you are going to have some seasonal widening as yearend gets closer,&quot; said another trader. &quot;We show (yield spreads) a little bit wider in the past couple of days, but if I had to make a bet, they will tighten short term.&quot;</p>
<p>By late afternoon, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent coupons were off 7/32 at 99-06/32, yielding 110 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.  </p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent pass-throughs were off 6/32 at 99-06/32, and Freddie Mac 30-years were down 7/32 to 99-09/32.</p>
<p>The 10-year note was off 5/32 to yield 6.57 percent. -- Jeff Coelho, 212-859-1562</p>
