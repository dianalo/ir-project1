<title>LITHUANIA: BOURSE HOPES FOR MORE FOREIGN INTEREST.</title>
<headline>BOURSE HOPES FOR MORE FOREIGN INTEREST.</headline>

<p>Lithuania's Stock Exchange hopes a May 15-16 conference in Vilnius will generate more foreign interest in the bourse, which has been struggling to regain the momentum it had during a bull run in January.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the first possibility to meet with foreign investors and to give them a full introduction to the Lithuanian securities market,&quot; said Rimantas Busila, General Director of the National Stock Exchange of Lithuania.</p>
<p>Brokers are also hoping that the conference will attract more foreign money into the local market.</p>
<p>&quot;Any kind of conference is important,&quot; said Tomas Andrejauskas, a broker with Suprema. &quot;That's marketing.&quot;</p>
<p>But Andrejauskas said any new interest resulting from the conference would not be seen quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't say it will affect the market within a week... perhaps in half a year,&quot; Andrejauskas said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that it will be helpful because there are no institutional investors in Lithuania,&quot;  said Grazina Bachiuliene, a broker with Vilfima.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no pension funds in Lithuania, and there are very few insurance companies...and they are interested in very safe investments,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;In Lithuania, it's a new kind of investment, and it's difficult to start when you see the prices going down,&quot; Bachiuliene added.</p>
<p>Share prices have been falling steadily, with a few hicups, since their brief but spectacular rise in January, when they soared to record highs.</p>
<p>But dealers and the bourse hope that long-term foreign investors will be lured by bargain prices, improved financial results, increased transparency, and the upcoming sale of key state assets.</p>
