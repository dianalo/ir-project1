<headline>Canadian 88 CEO blasts Morrison results.</headline>

<p>Canadian 88 Energy Corp chief executive Greg Noval said on Thursday that year-end results released on Wednesday by takeover target Morrison Petroleums Ltd were misleading and did nothing to change the company's value.</p>
<p>&quot;Morrison's doing their posturing and we're doing ours, but there's nothing that's changed here,&quot; Noval said in a phone interview from Winnipeg, his latest stop in a whirlwind tour to sell his bid to investors.  </p>
<p>He said that valuations put forward late last year by Nesbitt Burns, now one of Morrison's financial advisers, showed that the company's stock was fully valued at C$8.</p>
<p>Canadian 88 has bid C$10 cash, to a maximum of C$140 million, or 1.5 of its shares for each Morrison share. The hostile offer is valued at C$652 million.</p>
<p>&quot;I venture to say that if we withdrew our bid, the stock would be back at eight bucks,&quot; Noval said.</p>
<p>Morrison on Thursday was up 0.25 to C$10.55 in Toronto, a 52-week high, after announcing record financials on Wednesday and disclosing interest from other potential bidders.  </p>
<p>Noval disputed Morrison's disclosure that its finding and development costs dropped to as low as C$3.88 a barrel of oil equivalent of proven reserves and C$2.13 per BOE of proven plus probable reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;That's not accurate at all,&quot; he said. &quot;Actually, we've just gone over it with our (chartered accountant) and analyzed it and it works out to nine bucks.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said that Morrison was taking financial credit for proceeds from asset sales that had yet to be completed.  </p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, Morrison entered into deals to sell non-core oil and gas properties for proceeds of C$77 million. It also said on Wednesday it would close its new royalty trust, based on cash flow from an Alberta gas plant and British Columbia oil pipeline, next week for proceeds of C$180 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It's our understanding that these transactions are all effective in January, so they are sort of announcing reserves, production and numbers that they now don't have,&quot; Noval said, adding he believed much of Morrison's sharply higher cash flow and earnings in 1996 resulted from higher commodity prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they're leveling with their shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>Noval said he believed that talk about potential white knights in the wings for Morrison was little more than speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just some arbitrage guys playing around with their stock,&quot; he said. &quot;We've had 30 meetings in Canada last week and 25 so far this week, mostly in the U.S., and our offer is being very well received.</p>
