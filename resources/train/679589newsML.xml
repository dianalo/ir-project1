<headline>FOCUS-Euro tobacco stocks ease, shrug off deal.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tobacco stocks dipped modestly in Europe on Monday but they mostly shrugged off a record-breaking $368.5 billion settlement in the United States between the tobacco industry and state negotiators.</p>
<p>In London and Madrid, analysts said tobacco stocks were down but only because investors who had anticipated a settlement sold to take profits on shares bought before the pact was announced on Friday.</p>
<p>By the time the London stockmarket closed, Britain's B.A.T. Industries Plc shares were down 22 pence, or 3.6 percent, at 567 but the day's low of 563p.</p>
<p>&quot;The deal was a fairly good one for B.A.T., but the shares had a good run (up) ahead of the news,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;People bought on the rumour and sold on the fact.&quot;</p>
<p>On Friday, U.S. state attorneys general said tobacco firms had agreed to pay $368.5 billion over 25 years for personal injury claims and health programmes.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies would also be banned from advertising on billboards, vending machines, sports promotions and using human and cartoon characters on cigarette packages. Health warnings will have to occupy 25 percent of the front of cigarette packs.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress still needs to approve the landmark deal, which some European analysts said could dampen initial enthusiasm for tobacco shares in the near-term.</p>
<p>&quot;Tobacco shares have been quite buoyant over the last few weeks, and we have to bear in mind that this proposed deal still has to go through Congress,&quot; said Simon Willis, industry analyst at Charterhouse Tilney in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The companies have got the best deal they can get, and if the deal is altered at all in this process, it can only get worse.&quot;</p>
<p>But some analysts saw tobacco shares rebounding in relief that nearly three months of intense and uncertain negotiations have ended, allowing investors to refocus on individual companies.</p>
<p>London analysts expected B.A.T., whose Brown and Willamson unit is part of the U.S. deal, to turn its attention now to a demerger of its tobacco and insurance businesses to boost shareholder value.</p>
<p>In Madrid, analysts were also more focused on Spanish tobacco group Tabacalera SA's diversification plans. Last week, the company said it would buy 20 percent of duty-free shop operator Aldeasa, which was seen boosting the group's retail presence.</p>
<p>Tabacalera, which is 52-percent state-owned, fell 20 pesetas to 7,900, while the IBEX-35 index rose 40.03 points to 6,801.95.</p>
<p>But again, analysts attributed Tabacalera's 0.25-percent loss to profit-taking after strong gains earlier this year.</p>
<p>Some analysts also dismissed any ideas that a change in U.S. law would have an trickle down impact in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;It's wrong to see a settlement in the States as an opportunity to pursue tobacco companies in other countries,&quot; one analyst in Paris said. &quot;There are big differences in legal structure that make it harder for plaintiffs to pursue the tobacco industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Sophoclis Dodopoulos, managing director of Greece's fourth-largest cigarette maker, SEKAP, said: &quot;The anti-smoking campaign hysteria has not produced the desired results. In some cases, it has had a reverse effect with consumption rising.&quot;</p>
<p>Dodopoulos noted that year-over-year 1996 cigarette consumption in Greece rose 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happening in the U.S. is a different story,&quot; he said. &quot;You must comprehend Greek reality. This is all foreign.&quot;</p>
