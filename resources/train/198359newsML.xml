<p>East Timor was reported quiet on Monday after a week of orderly demonstrations culminating in the return of Nobel Peace laureate Bishop Carlos Belo to the capital Dili at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is very quiet,&quot; a resident contacted by phone told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is happening. Everything is normal,&quot; a diplomatic source in close contact with the territory said.</p>
<p>Belo returned to Dili on Saturday from Jakarta, where he had been the target of official and media criticism and protests over an interview with a German news magazine in which he reportedly said the Indonesian military had treated East Timorese like dogs.</p>
<p>He had attended an annual meeting in Jakarta of Roman Catholic bishops from around Indonesia. He has so far declined to comment on the magazine interview report.</p>
<p>Thousands of people welcomed him back to Dili and attended prayers at the city's cathedral at which Belo called for a halt to demonstrations, residents said.</p>
<p>Demonstrations initially led by students at the University of East Timor had started in support of the bishop last Tuesday, which also marked the anniversary of the killing of at least 50 people by Indonesian troops in Dili in November 1991.</p>
<p>The Norwegian embassy in Jakarta said Belo had been issued a visa to receive the Nobel peace prize at a ceremony in Oslo next month. The bishop was the joint recipient of the 1996 award together with East Timor-born independence activist Jose Ramos Horta, who lives in Australia.</p>
<p>The official Antara news agency reported that Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had said after meeting his Vatican counterpart, Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, in Rome that Belo should stay out of politics.</p>
<p>&quot;The Indonesian government has always recognised and respected Bishop Belo in his position as leader of the Catholic Church in East Timor but takes strong exception (to) him engaging in politics,&quot; Alatas told reporters.</p>
<p>Indonesian troops occupied the former Portuguese colony in December 1975 and East Timor was declared Indonesia's 27th province the following July in a move not recognised by the United Nations.</p>
