<p>Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan said on Tuesday he had sacked the commander of the defence force who had earlier demanded that Chan resign over the prime minister's decision to hire mercenaries.</p>
<p>Chan said in a statement the Papua New Guinea cabinet had decided late on Monday to sack Brigadier General Jerry Singirok and replace him with Colonol Alfred Aikung. Chan's statement confirmed television reports of the sackings late on Monday.  </p>
<p>&quot;After a meeting long into Monday night, the Papua New Guinea cabinet has removed Brigadier General Jerry Singirok from his position as Commander of the Defence Force,&quot; Chan said in the statement.</p>
<p>Chan said he was intensely concerned at the actions Singirok took on Monday, including demanding that Chan and his senior ministers resign within 48 hours or he would call for the government to be forced aside.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a democratically elected government and as the representatives of the people we will not be stood over by a member of the disciplinary forces who is supposed to be acting on the expressed wishes of the people, through the elected represenatives,&quot; Chan said.</p>
<p>Chan said he had the support of 3,000 police and had reassured all Papua New Guinea citizens that he and the cabinet were in complete control of the situation.</p>
