<headline>KL overnight rises on squaring ahead of weekend.</headline>
<text>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 (Reute) - The overnight interbank rate rose to 8.7/8 percent against 8.4/5 previously as banks rushed to square up their positions ahead of the weekend in a liquidity-short market, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said some Bank Negara agents continued lending, but the market was too short to prevent a spike up in rates.</p>
<p>&quot;They were not really injecting money this afternoon. They were just helping people square up,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Interbank rates rose despite fresh injection of funds into the banking system by Bank Negara Malaysia, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said rates started rising soon after the central bank's agents stopped making offers in mid-morning trading.</p>
<p>&quot;The funds were obviously not enough. Once the agents stopped, merchant banks and other small guys started bidding rates up,&quot; said the head of money dealing at a local bank.</p>
<p>There was no confirmation of the funds injection from Bank Negara, which does not usually comment on its market operations.</p>
<p>He said rates would have gone up further but for a persistent rumour about a possible cut in banks' statutory reserves requirement (SRR).</p>
<p>Banks in Malaysia have to maintain a certain percentage of their deposits in liquid assets, mainly government paper.</p>
<p>Dealers said one-week money was at 8.6/7 percent against 8.00/30 on Thursday, one-month at 8.4/5 percent against 8.0, three-month at 8.3/5 percent against 7.8/8.0 and six-month at 8.0/8.3 percent against 7.8/8.0.</p>
<p>Bank Negara is said to have injected funds over the past 10 days to help ease market tightness.</p>
<p>Recent heavy buying of the ringgit by the central bank to defend the currency from speculative attack had caused a liquidity squeeze.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were down across the board to reflect the rebound in interest rates, futures dealers said.</p>
<p>At noon, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was down eight points to 92.32, or an implied yield of 7.68 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract was down eight at 92.54, or 7.46 percent.</p>
