<p>Hong Kong stocks ended firmer on Tuesday and the Hang Seng index hits its highest close since February 1994, buoyed by Wall Street's high and the view that a near-term rate hike would not hit stocks hard, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;With precious little news on the domestic front, Hong Kong remains tied to the U.S. interest rate outlook -- which now looks limited to a 0.25 percent hike,&quot; said James Osborn, sales director at ING Barings.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed up 53.71 points, 0.46 percent, at 11,621.61, off an intra-day high of 11,645.35. The blue-chip barometer last closed higher at 12,157.57 on February 4, 1994.</p>
<p>Turnover was a healthy HK$7.05 billion, just shy of Monday's HK$7.56 billion, and borkers cited the rise in turnover as the single most bullish factor in the market on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of funds that are underweighted in Hong Kong were active, trying to participate in the market's gains,&quot; said Alvin Owyang, associate director at OCBC Securities.</p>
<p>Some cautioned buying activity was partly artificial, padded by the futures related buying of hedge funds.  Others saw the market's limited advance on heavy turnover in fundamental terms.</p>
<p>&quot;The index's hesitation at 11,600 (the previous 1996 intra-day high) suggests investors are confused about the correct valuation for the market,&quot; Osborn said. &quot;We are still waiting to see how institutional funds will reallocate their Asian funds.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hang Seng pushed through 11,600 at the open but returned to waver around that level for most of the day.</p>
<p>The commercial and industrial index, which includes the territory's largest trading conglomerates, led the market rising 1.01 percent compared with the Hang Seng's gain of 0.46 percent.</p>
<p>Utility counters followed in a catching up exercise, having lagged the market for some time.</p>
<p>Swire Pacific was the star blue chip, gaining HK$1.00 to HK$69.50. Brokers said the share is benefitting from improved sentiment surrounding the residential property market.</p>
<p>Hutchison put on HK$0.70 to HK$49.80 and China Light added HK$0.20 to HK$34.50.  HSBC was unchanged at HK$140.50.</p>
<p>China-incorporated H shares significantly underperformed the market with the Hang Seng Index Chinese Enterprise Index showing a decline of 0.47 percent.</p>
<p>Maanshan Iron rose HK$0.02 to HK$1.41, but Jingwei Textile fell HK$0.03 to HK$1.03 and Guangshen Rail dropped HK$0.07 to HK$2.925.</p>
