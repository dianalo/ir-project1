<p>A South Korean court sentenced a U.S. serviceman to 15 years in jail on Thursday for murdering a Korean prostitute in a case that sparked renewed protests over the presence of U.S. forces in the country.</p>
<p>Eric Munnich, 22, from Chicago, confessed at his trial to stabbing the woman to death in a drunken rage during a quarrel over payment for sexual services.</p>
<p>A defence lawyer, who declined to be named, quoted Munnich as saying the sentence was too heavy and he would appeal on the grounds that the prostitute had begun the fight.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had demanded life in jail, but the judge explained he had handed down a lesser sentence because Munnich was drunk at the time of the murder and emotionally unstable as a new arrival in South Korea.</p>
<p>Resentment over the special legal status of the 37,000 American troops in the country was inflamed when U.S. military authorities rejected a South Korean request to hand him over to Korean custody pending his trial.</p>
<p>Munnich is still in U.S. military detention, but if his conviction is upheld he would serve his sentence in a Korean jail.</p>
<p>Several hundred protesters demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy in Seoul after a funeral service for the prostitute. The commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, General John Tillely, called the murder &quot;tragic and nonsensical&quot;.</p>
<p>U.S. forces are stationed in South Korea to deter aggression by North Korea. The two Koreas have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce.</p>
<p>The body of Lee Ki-sun, 44, was discovered in a boarding house near a U.S. military base north of Seoul in September.</p>
