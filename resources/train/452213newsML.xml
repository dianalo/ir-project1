<p>Belgian hurdler Jonathan Nsenga has been suspended for three months after testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine at this month's world indoor athletics championships in Paris, the Belgian athletic federation said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said Nsenga, who was sixth in the 60 metres hurdles final, would not ask for a second test as that would only delay the suspension.</p>
<p>She said Nsenga had been careless in taking Chinese herbs which contained ephedrine.</p>
<p>&quot;There are extenuating circumstances...It was not indicated that the herbs contained ephedrine,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I got Asian herbs prescribed which apparently contained ephedrine but it was not on purpose, I didn't know at all,&quot; Nsenga told Belgian RTBF television.</p>
<p>He criticised the lack of medical guidance for athletes in Belgium.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no structure...there is no medical unit... we're left on our own and that's a pity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Belgian union itself had asked for Nsenga to be tested by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) after he broke the national 60 metres hurdles record twice in Paris.</p>
