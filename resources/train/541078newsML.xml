<headline>Former U.S. envoy re-arrested in HK passport case.</headline>

<p>A former top U.S. immigration official had a fleeting taste of freedom on Friday before he was re-arrested by Hong Kong's anti-corruption police moments after an appeals court ruled he had been convicted of the wrong crime.</p>
<p>Jerry Stuchiner, 45, was sentenced to 40 months in jail last August after he admitted possessing false travel documents.</p>
<p>But the five Honduran passports he carried were blank except for an official stamp and signature. By legal definition, a travel document must include a photograph.</p>
<p>Stuchiner was freed after three appeal court judges ruled he had been charged with the wrong offence and the conviction was unsustainable, government radio reported.</p>
<p>But investigators from the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) were waiting for Stuchiner as he stepped out of the Supreme Court building and took him to be charged with possessing equipment to make forged passports, it said.</p>
<p>The radio later said Stuchiner had been charged and was being held in ICAC custody. He was scheduled to appear in district court on Tuesday.</p>
<p>An ICAC official said a statement would be issued later.</p>
<p>Stuchiner was first arrested last July by the ICAC, which was working with U.S. Justice Department officials probing a smuggling ring that took illegal migrants from Asia to the United States.</p>
