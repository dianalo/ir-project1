<headline>Lawyers for Saudi bomb suspect granted more time.</headline>

<p>Lawyers for a Saudi suspect in the bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia last year were granted more time on Thursday to prepare their case.</p>
<p>Court-appointed public defender Francis Carter sought the delay, saying everything alleged in the indictment against his client, Hani al-Sayegh, &quot;has occurred half-way around the world.&quot; U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan said he had &quot;absolutely no reluctance&quot; in granting a request to postpone proceedings until July 30.</p>
<p>Sayegh, 29, is accused of acting as the driver and lookout in the June 1996 attack on Khobar Towers, a U.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia. He was arrested in Canada and deported to the United States on June 17 after striking a deal with U.S. officials under which he would plead guilty to lesser charges arising from an unrelated, anti-American plot hatched in the Middle East but never carried out.</p>
<p>As part of the plea bargain, he would cooperate with U.S. authorities and tell them what he knows about the Khobar Towewrs bombing. Sayegh, whose case already has been postponed twice, was said to be reconsidering the arrangement.</p>
<p>According to his immigration lawyer, Michael Wildes, he maintains he was not involved in any way in the Khobar Towers bombing. &quot;He has no information whatsoever, at all, as to who perpetrated this atrocity or any details in this regard,&quot; Wildes said before his client's June 26 court appearance.</p>
<p>Sayegh, being held in a safe house at an undisclosed location, told the New York Times in a telephone interview published on Tuesday that he was in Iran at the time of the bombing. He said his passport bears a stamp showing he entered Iran before the June 25 attack and that a Kuwait airline manifest showed he left Iran for Kuwait shortly afterward.</p>
<p>Attorney General Janet Reno, asked on Thursday how concerned she was that Sayegh had changed his story, replied: &quot;I can't comment on a pending matter such as that, except to say that what we're determined to do is to try to get to the truth.&quot;</p>
