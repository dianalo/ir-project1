<p>- One day before key heroin trafficking suspect Li Yun-chung is due to be extradited to the United States, authorities are still in the dark over a 20 million baht bribe he allegedly paid to buy his freedom and flight to Burma. Li, or Phongsak Rojjanassakkul, was re-arrested in Rangoon in late April and sent back to Thailand on May 17. In a swift 20-minute special hearing two days later, the Criminal Court ruled in favour of Li's request for immediate extradition to the U.S. and the date was fixed for tomorrow. (THE NATION)</p>

The businessman, who identified himself only as Kang, says customs officers ask him to buy back his own cargo for 330,000 baht. (BANGKOK POST)</p>

<p>- Thailand will protest against Indonesia and Malaysia increasing their tariffs from 5 percent to 45 percent on petrochemical products, as they are on the ASEAN accelerated tariff reduction programme. Petrochemical products are on the ASEAN Free Trade Area's (AFTA) &quot;Fast Track&quot; tariff cut programme and Indonesia and Malaysia must reduce import duties on them to between 0-5 percent by January 1, 2000 if their old tariff rates were above 20 percent.
