<dateline>TOKYO 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Japan's Rikadenki Kogyo Co Ltd were ask-only on Monday morning after it said last week that banks are likely to suspend its right to make fresh transactions as of March 5.</p>
<p>As of 0126 GMT, shares in the measuring instrument maker were ask-only at 175 yen. The shares were last traded at 365 yen on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement on Friday that banks were likely to suspend its right to engage in fresh transactions as of March 5 because of its failure to honour promissory notes for a second time. The company said that it had not decided whether to continue its business or to restructure, but added that it would make public its decision soon.  </p>
<p>The Rikadenki shares, traded on the over-the-counter market, are likely to be put under surveillance on March 5, when banks actually take such a step, an official of the Japan Securities Dealers' Association said on Monday.</p>
<p>Rikadenki said it had suffered from falling prices for its mainstay industrial measuring products in the face of tough competition from domestic rivals. It has posted a current loss for eight successive years, it said.</p>
