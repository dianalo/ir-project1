<headline>&quot;New&quot; owner Citgo wants labor talks at Ill. plant.</headline>

<p>Less than a year after a lengthy labor dispute was settled at an oil refinery in Lemont, Illinois, workers at the plant have been told that the &quot;new&quot; owners want to renegotiate the contract.</p>
<p>Citgo Petroleum Corp, U.S. unit of Venezuela's state-owned Petroleos de Venzuela (PdVSA), said Thursday it wants to renegotiate the contract that was ratified last year by the union and its then owners, Unocal Corp and PDV America Inc, PdVSA's main U.S. holding company.</p>
<p>Citgo spokesperson Kate Robbins said the company wants to renegotiate the pact because it did not have a say in its drafting.</p>
<p>&quot;Originally, the previous labor contract was negotiated with a different owner, UNO-VEN. Citgo was not involved in the drafting,&quot; said Robbins.</p>
<p>However, according to a union official who didn't want to be named, the Oil and Atomic Workers Union (OCAW) will maintain that Citgo's beneficial owner was one of the signatory's to last year's agreement and therefore it should remain in force.</p>
<p>The deal completed between Unocal and PDV America three weeks ago left Unocal with the UNO-VEN corporate entity and $250 million in cash.</p>
<p>The UNO-VEN assets, including the 153,000 barrels per day plant, were transferred to a newly created company, PDV MidWest Refining, which in turn gave an operating contract to Citgo.</p>
<p>Union sources say Citgo is looking to invoke a law used by many new owners in order to force a new contract on workers. The law, the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court ruling Burns Security Services versus National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), essentially declared that new owners are not bound by labor contracts agreed with the previous owners.</p>
<p>&quot;This is deja vu all over again,&quot; said the union source. &quot;I can't believe that when they negotiated the contract last year, which all the parties said was to their satisfaction, that it was in good faith.&quot;</p>
