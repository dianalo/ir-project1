<p>Hong Kong stocks staged an early rebound in Friday morning trade then swiftly fell on heavy selling of property stocks as uncertainty over the details of government plans to curb property prices caused market jitters.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index was down 100.34 points, or 0.67 percent, at 14,955.40 after surging to an early high of 15,179.53 points following new record highs on Wall Street overnight.</p>
<p>Turnover was HK$6.36 billion after the first 55 minutes of trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The property sector is still affected by government plans to cool down residential prices,&quot; said Ricky Tam, senior research analyst at Delta Asia Securities.</p>
<p>Shares in Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd fell HK$1.00 to HK$72.75 and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd shed HK$1.25 to HK$87.50.</p>
<p>But shares in HSBC Holdings Plc limited the market's fall rising HK$3.00 to HK$241.00.</p>
<p>&quot;The London stock market went to new highs and HSBC is one of the London index stocks,&quot; said Tam.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected some bargain-hunting, particularly in the red chip sector, on Friday after stocks tumbled on the first trading day under China on Thursday.</p>
<p>Among the most actively traded stocks, red chip China Everbright Technology Ltd rose HK$0.20 to HK$3.00.</p>
<p>China Resources Enterprise Ltd surged HK$1.00 to HK$36.00 and China Merchants Holdings (International) Co Ltd rose HK$0.70 to HK$22.40.</p>
<p>&quot;People have to put their money somewhere. They are not going to put it in property so red chips still have some momentum,&quot; said Geoff Galbraith, institutional sales trader at NAVA SC Securities.</p>
<p>Tam said the Hang Seng Index should find some support around 14,900 points. The blue chip index fell 141.05 points on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;If 14,900 can't hold, then the market tone is likely to change to the downside,&quot; said Tam.</p>
