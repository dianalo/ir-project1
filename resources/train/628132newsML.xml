<title>MALAYSIA: Malaysian activists protest ASEAN meeting on Burma.</title>
<headline>Malaysian activists protest ASEAN meeting on Burma.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysian rights activists on Friday protested Burma's planned entry into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ahead of a weekend meeting expected to decide when Rangoon will be admitted to the regional grouping.</p>
<p>&quot;We call on ASEAN governments to abandon their failed policy of constructive engagement and deny ASEAN membership (to Burma),&quot; Fan Yew Teng, spokesman for the group of 22 Malaysian non-governmental organisations, said in a memorandum.</p>
<p>The activists, carrying placards calling Burma's military rulers &quot;murderers, criminals and drug traffickers&quot;, staged the protest outside the foreign ministry, where they handed over the memorandum to a ministry official.</p>
<p>Fan said that since ASEAN launched its &quot;constructive engagement&quot; policy in 1991, &quot;there has been absolutely no movement on the part of (the military government) towards democracy by way of handing power to the duly elected representatives of the Burmese people&quot;.</p>
<p>ASEAN says its policy toward Burma is aimed at reforming the regime from within and keeping it from becoming isolated.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers from ASEAN -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- were due to arrive in Kuala Lumpur on Friday for the meeting on Saturday.</p>
<p>ASEAN has already decided to admit Burma, Cambodia and Laos as a group this year. The meeting is to decide exactly when.</p>
<p>Malaysia, this year's ASEAN chairman, has been pressing for the three to be inducted at ASEAN's annual ministerial meeting scheduled for July 24-25 in Kuala Lumpur. Another proposal would admit the three at an informal ASEAN summit in December, to which Japan, South Korea and China have also be invited.</p>
