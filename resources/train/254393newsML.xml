<headline>Regulator's review to speed metal market changes.</headline>

<p>Changes will take place in metal markets in the next few years, whatever the outcome and recommendations of a wide-ranging review of the London Metal Exchange (LME) by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB).</p>
<p>The report by the SIB, Britain's top financial markets watchdog, which is due to be released later this month, was commissioned by the LME after the Sumitomo Corp scandal erupted in June this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the LME) had been changing for some years, anyway. Sumitomo and the SIB will probably accelerate that process,&quot; one senior trader said on Friday. The Sumitomo scandal shocked the market in June, when the Japanese company fired its head copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka. He was said by Sumitomo to have admitted running up losses of $2.6 billion in unauthorised copper trading.</p>
<p>Industry sources say the SIB may suggest changes, such as daily reporting of inventory movements, revealing ownership of those inventories in warehouses, and more transparency on market positions.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;the LME's membership needs opening out...There are many mining companies who are just not involved, who are not members in any shape or form, and Board entry is very much restricted to the LME ring,&quot; another senior trader said. So the structure of the LME's board is likely to be different, with wider industry and non-ring dealing representation, and perhaps a figure-head Chairman who is not so closely identified with the Exchange, some suggested.</p>
<p>Another possibility is a two-tier management structure to oversee the market, similar to the separate LME Board and Committee that prevailed before the 1985 tin crisis and the subsequent re-organization of the Exchange.</p>
<p>Christopher Gilbert of the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) earlier this week called for client position reporting and publication of large speculative and hedge positions -- measures encompassing better transparancy.</p>
<p>Britain's Financial Services Act, which was enacted in 1986, should also be amended to make market manipulation illegal in Britain, Gilbert said.</p>
<p>However, the alleged manipulation by Sumitomo's Hamanaka, which may stretch back 10 years, cannot be blamed entirely on the LME and its form of trading which is different from other global derivative exchanges.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the LME has performed very well in this. The problem is that internal controls are not keeping up with changes in trading,&quot; one leading source said.</p>
<p>A common factor linking Sumitomo to other cases of so called &quot;rogue traders&quot; such as the former Barings' trader Nick Leeson has been the failure from within to monitor and check trading activities, not inherent faults in the derivatives or their markets.</p>
<p>Therefore, more emphasis needs to be placed on &quot;beefing-up&quot; these internal controls, with more vigilance by senior management, rather than a &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to superstar traders and their high profits, industry sources said.</p>
