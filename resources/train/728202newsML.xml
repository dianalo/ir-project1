<p>Jan Ullrich of Germany emerged as cycling's new man to beat on Tuesday when he took a remarkable lead of nearly three minutes with a devastating finish to the 10th stage of the Tour de France.</p>
<p>Ullrich, the first German to wear the leader's yellow jersey since 1978, crushed his rivals, including his Telekom team leader and defending champion Bjarne Riis, with a powerful breakaway on the steep climb to the finish at Arcalis in Andorra.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old German was one minute eight seconds ahead of second-placed Italian Marco Pantani and third-placed Frenchman Richard Virenque, in the 252.5-km stage in the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>Klaus Peter Thaler was the last German to wear the prized yellow jersey which he held for two days 19 years ago. No German has ever won the Tour.</p>
<p>Ullrich was 2:38 ahead of Virenque overall. Spaniard Abraham Olano, tipped before the Tour as a strong contender to fill the void left by compatriot Miguel Indurain who retired after five wins, was 4:46 adrift overall with Riis another seven seconds behind and Pantani 5:29.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt a great joy (putting on the yellow jersey). Ever since the first time I watched the Tour de France as a boy I wanted to become a cycling professional and one day wear it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I had not thought about the yellow jersey before the Tour. I thought about helping Bjarne Riis. But yesterday I felt good and thought I must try. Today I believed I could.&quot;</p>
<p>Ullrich already looked strong as he came in fourth behind Frenchman Laurent Brochard on Monday in the first mountain stage of the Tour. He moved up to second overall then just 13 seconds behind Frenchman Cedric Vasseur, who is now 10th and 7:31 adrift.</p>
<p>Virenque, first over the line on the Tour's highest climb of 2,407 metres at Port d'Envalira and who took over the polka dot best climber jersey from his Festina team mate Brochard, said: &quot;Today we saw a great Ullrich.&quot;</p>
<p>On the longest day of the Tour -- Ullrich won in 7:46:06 -- the leading group remained compact right into Andorra, the likes of Riis and Olano making up on the descents the time they gave away on the climbs.</p>
<p>Then in the principality, Frenchman Jean-Philippe Dojwa of the Mutuelle de Seine et Marne team made a solo break on the day's fifth of six climbs at Ordino and remained ahead until Ullrich made his attack some 10 km from the Arcalis finish.</p>
<p>Riis somehow managed to draw new strength in the final climb when he had looked out for the count. He embraced and congratulated Ullrich afterwards.</p>
<p>The Dane said he and Ullrich had not discussed the German going out on his own, but he said: &quot;We have to accept that the way he was riding so strongly he should go for it..&quot;</p>
<p>Ullrich denied he had thoughts of victory on the Champs Elysees in Paris on July 27.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many days still to come, very hard days in the Alps,&quot; Ullrich said.</p>
<p>All the riders stopped 45 km from the Luchon start at the Portet d'Aspet climb for a minute's silence in memory of Fabio Casartelli at the Italian's memorial on the roadside where he was killed in a fall in 1995.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 192-km 11th stage heads out of Andorra and down to the Mediterranean at Perpignan.</p>
