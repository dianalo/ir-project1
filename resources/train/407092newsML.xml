<headline>Hungary shares end lower after Greenspan comments.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-02-27</dateline>

<p>Most Budapest Stock Exchange shares which traded on Thursday closed steady to lower as both Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments on the U.S. economy and the lack of Hungarian corporate news made investors uncertain, traders said.</p>
<p>The BUX index finished at 5,603.09 points, down 13.93.</p>
<p>&quot;The shares dropped due to a little correction after recent rises and also due to Greenspan's comments,&quot; said Gabor Borda of Concorde. &quot;Greenspan called the (share) market overheated and that makes people think.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan warned of excessive optimism over the U.S. economy and too large rises in U.S. equity prices over the last two years. Traders said interest rate hike expectations in the U.S. usually weakens demand on the BSE.</p>
<p>They said the BSE was otherwise trendless on the lack of fresh corporate news.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is cautious, waits and does not dare to buy,&quot; New York Broker's Attila Gazdik said. &quot;There are no negative (domestic) news&quot;.</p>
<p>News about the oil and gas company MOL's oil exploration and production contract with Syria and the continuation of drug maker Richter's privatisation did not provide enough incentive for price rises.</p>
<p>Richter, following Thursday's general trend, eased and finished at 12,250 forints, down 50.</p>
<p>MOL traded slightly above Wednesday's closing price for most of the session but closed steady at 3,155 forints.</p>
<p>Packaging company Cofinec was boosted to 5,600 forints by a large block deal of 55,000 shares, and closed at 5,580 forints.</p>
<p>Traders said Cofinec's BSE prices followed the stock's firming on London's SEAQ, but added that they did not see fundamental reason for its rise.</p>
