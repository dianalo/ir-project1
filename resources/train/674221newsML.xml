<p>The European Union on Thursday expressed its concern at the murder of two human rights campaigners in Colombia a month ago and by the &quot;deplorable&quot; human rights climate in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Union is gravely concerned by the murder of two members of the organisation CINEP...as well as by the deplorable state of human rights in Colombia, including the grave personal risks that are faced by human rights defenders and the unacceptable high levels of impunity in Colombia,&quot; the Dutch EU presidency said in a statement.</p>
<p>Five gunmen smashed their way into a Bogota apartment on May 19 and shot dead Mario Calderon and his wife Elsa, who both worked for the Centre for Research and Popular Education (CINEP), a human rights centre run by Jesuit priests.</p>
<p>The centre's deputy director, Father Hernan Gonzalez, blamed a right-wing death squad for the murders.</p>
<p>&quot;The EU urges the Colombian government to now make a very serious effort to fulfil its commitment to ensure the protection of all human rights...for everyone, including those who actively promote and defend these rights in Colombian society,&quot; the Union said.</p>
<p>Human rights groups say campaigners in Colombia are often accused by military and government officials of being leftist sympathizers and mouthpieces for communist guerrillas who have waged a war against the state for three decades.</p>
<p>&quot;While acknowledging that many of the acts of violence are not committed by government forces, the EU deplores the murders and disappearances of elected public officials and candidates for public office as well as the forced and sometimes violent displacement of many rural communities that have taken place in the current year,&quot; the Union said.</p>
<p>Mario Calderon's father-in-law also died in the attack. His mother-in-law suffered bullet wounds but survived and his 2-year-old son escaped death by hiding in a closet.</p>
