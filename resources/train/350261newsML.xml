<p>Optimism that the Federal Reserve would leave monetary policy unchanged at its meeting this week drove the prices of U.S. Treasury securities higher Monday.</p>
<p>Investor optimism was fueled by a weaker-than-expected January report from the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM), one that indicated some slowing in manufacturing and a sizable drop in supplier deliveries.</p>
<p>The 30-year long bond ended 19/32 higher at 96 30/32 to yield 6.74 percent, down from 6.79 percent late Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The (Wall) Street got very complacent to the short and when the NAPM numbers hit -- numbers that were favorable for the Fed remaining on hold -- we had a lot of short covering. Some people were forced back into the market,&quot; said a trader at a primary dealership.</p>
<p>It was a day that also saw the return of retail investors.</p>
<p>&quot;I trade the front of the curve and all I heard were people telling me to bid,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>The NAPM quashed any lingering doubts among many investors that the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would vote to tighten policy at its meeting Tuesday and Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The economy remains vigorous. Nonetheless we are seeing some slowing in the first quarter and the market has responded to incipient signs of that,&quot; said Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh. Many of the factors that contributed to the 4.7 percent increase in fourth quarter growth simply were one-time events or unsustainable, he said.</p>
<p>The next major reading on the economy comes Friday with the January employment report. A Reuters consensus called for the creation of 237,000 payrolls, a 5.2-percent jobless rate, and a 0.2-percent gain in average hourly earnings.  </p>
<p>Berner said payrolls may show some consolidation, but he still saw solid growth of at least 3.0 percent in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Given that we are a relatively high-yield economy, there's a lot of incentive to move money into our markets, especially from Japan,&quot; Berner said, a factor that will continue to support the bond market.</p>
<p>Also underpinning bond prices are hopes a deal can be worked out in Washington on a balanced budget by 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;Both sides are showing a lot of comity and good feeling, but I'm skeptical they'll reach agreement,&quot; Berner said.  </p>
<p>Kathy Bostjancic, money market analyst at UBS Securities Inc., said trading activity slowed after the initial flareup in wake of the NAPM release.</p>
<p>Much of the early trading activity was the result of dealers scrambling to cover shorts, Bostjancic said. Volume fell off throughout the remainder of the session.</p>
<p>&quot;With the FOMC meeting, people are just going to sit tight for a while -- even though there's virtually no expectation of a change in monetary policy,&quot; Bostjancic said.</p>
<p>As-expected and largely ignored were small rises in December U.S. personal income and personal spending.  </p>
<p>The Treasury Department's auction of three- and six-month bills produced averages of 5.00 percent and 5.08 percent, respectively. The Fed intervened during its usual midmorning period by injecting reserves into the banking system via a round of overnight system repurchase agreements.</p>
<p>Also posting gains on Monday were the two-year note, up 3/32 at 100-even and at 5.87 percent, the five-year, up 7/32 at 100-7/32 and at 6.20 percent, and the 10-year note, up 12/32 at 100-12/32 and 6.45 percent.</p>
