<title>UK: Brazil global bond trading just over reoffer level.</title>
<headline>Brazil global bond trading just over reoffer level.</headline>

<p>Brazil's $750 million five-year global bond was trading just above its 265 basis points reoffer spread on Tuesday, the deal's lead managers said.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Securities quoted paper at a 275/265 b.p. yield spread, while a new issues trader at SBC Warburg said the deal was &quot;bid at 99-3/8 for a 275 b.p. spread&quot;.</p>
<p>The deal, launched on Monday, was sold around 40 percent into Asia, 20 percent into Europe, 20 percent into Latin America and 20 percent to the U.S., SBC Warburg said after the pricing.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg said it was encouraged to see such strong demand from Asian investors many of whom were new to the LatAm sector.</p>
<p>The pricing, at a yield substantially below similar-dated deals from Argentina and Mexico which both have higher credit ratings, was no little talking point prior to launch.</p>
<p>Brazil argued its credit ratings were too low. Gustavo Franco, director of international affairs at the central bank, told bankers in London last Friday that an upgrade was overdue and rating agencies were putting too much emphasis on the past.</p>
<p>Brazil is rated B1 by Moody's Investors Service and B- by Standard and Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>Franco also said the deal was the first in a series of benchmarks Brazil planned in an effort to obtain cheaper debt.</p>
