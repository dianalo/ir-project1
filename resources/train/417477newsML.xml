<p>A peaceful end to Peru's hostage crisis remained elusive on Monday, as the Peruvian government and rebels failed to reach agreement despite a Cuban offer of asylum for the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas.</p>
<p>Government negotiators met MRTA representatives at a Red Cross safe house for the eighth time since the siege began 76 days ago, but talks guarantors said afterward both sides were just digging in behind their bargaining positions.</p>
<p>&quot;The commission of guarantors can indicate that both sides are completing their proposals, which without encompassing agreement will clearly establish their positions,&quot; Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent -- one of three guarantors -- told reporters in a prepared statement after the meeting.</p>
<p>The downbeat communique was a dash of cold water after a surprise trip by President Alberto Fujimori to the Dominican Republic and Cuba raised the possibility of a Caribbean asylum for the 20-odd hostage takers in a deal to end the siege.</p>
<p>The MRTA's European spokesman provided further pessimism by saying the rebels were not interested in asylum.</p>
<p>Monday's meeting was carried out in a &quot;cordial&quot; atmosphere, Vincent said, but MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa did not attend. He was represented by his second-in-command, Rolly Rojas.</p>
<p>The presence of Cerpa was seen as a positive sign when he first left his stronghold in the captured Japanese ambassador's residence to take part in the fourth round of talks.</p>
<p>The talks will continue on Wednesday, Vincent said.</p>
<p>Fujimori earlier told a news conference in Havana that Cuban leader Fidel Castro had agreed to grant the guerrillas asylum if all sides agreed to a way out of Latin America's longest-running hostage siege.</p>
<p>&quot;Cuba is willing to cooperate in the framework for this asylum but not to participate as a mediator,&quot; Fujimori said.</p>
<p>Peruvian media reported the Dominican Republic may take six rebels.</p>
<p>But the MRTA's international spokesman said the guerrillas would not be lured out of the residence by promises of asylum.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not thinking about leaving Peru,&quot; spokesman Isaac Velasco told reporters in Pamplona, Spain, where he was attending a book presentation.</p>
<p>The heavily-armed Tupac Amaru guerrillas stormed a cocktail party at the residence on Dec. 17. They captured hundreds of hostages, but released most of them to keep 72 heavyweight bargaining chips.</p>
<p>Their main demand is the release of 400 jailed comrades. Fujimori has ruled this out, but hinted at other concessions.</p>
