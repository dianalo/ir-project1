<p>China's top crematorium will use a brand-new, specially-purchased incinerator to cremate paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to try to avoid his ashes being mixed with those of lesser men, Chinese sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Babaoshan crematorium in western Beijing, where almost all Chinese leaders are reduced to ashes after they &quot;go to meet Marx&quot;, had arranged in advance to import and install a new furnace for Deng, who died late on Wednesday night, they said.</p>
<p>Officials at the crematorium had been afraid that, if an existing incinerator were used, some of Deng's ashes could be mixed with those of other clients, the sources said.</p>
<p>A Babaoshan official contacted by telephone said he was unaware of new incinerator purchases and that the crematorium had yet to receive any directions on handling Deng's remains.</p>
<p>&quot;The funerals of Chinese leaders are generally held in Babaoshan, but... we are not clear at the moment if Deng Xiaoping's funeral will be held here,&quot; he said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Beijing has long tried to protect precious farmland by curbing the traditional practice of burial for the dead and by encouraging cremation instead, a policy promoted by Deng.</p>
<p>The late Chairman Mao Zedong received neither treatment. His corpse was preserved after his death in 1976 and is displayed in a mausoleum built to his memory in central Beijing's vast Tiananmen Square.</p>
