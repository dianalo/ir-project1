<p>Israelis soldiers killed a Palestinian and wounded three others in a clash in a West Bank village near Jerusalem on Tuesday, the army said.</p>
<p>An army spokesman said the soldiers were attacked by Palestinian residents of the Hizmeh village north of Jerusalem during operational activity.</p>
<p>&quot;The force responded with fire killing one Palestinian, wounding one moderately to severely and wounding two others lightly,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said the army was in contact with Palestinian police about the incident.</p>
<p>A Palestinian witness told Israel Radio he thought the gunmen were civilians but security sources said they were soldiers from an undercover unit who patrol the West Bank in civilian clothes, often dressed to look like Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;Three Jews went into the village and caused trouble...They were not soldiers,&quot; the witness said.</p>
<p>The prime minister's office issued a statement saying Benjamin Netanyahu had been briefed about the incident.</p>
