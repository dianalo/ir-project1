<p>Air cargo and trade executives are worried that the U.S. government will impose trade sanctions against Colombia when it reviews its relationship with drug-related countries next week.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government imposes sanctions, such as a tax on flowers, it would be a major blow to the air cargo and the flower industry in South Florida,&quot; said B.F. Spohrer, president of Miami-based Challenge Air Cargo. He is also chairman of the World Trade Centre Miami.</p>
<p>Currently flowers from Colombia enjoy a special trade status and no duty is charged.</p>
<p>Last March 1, President Bill Clinton decertified Colombia as a reliable ally in the drug war, saying the Colombian government was not doing enought to combat the cartels.</p>
<p>By law, each year the president must review the anti-drugs efforts of countries that are on the black list.</p>
<p>This year 32 countries will be reviewed in a report called the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which the State Department compiles from all government agencies involved in the drug war, a State Department spokesman said.</p>
<p>Although decertified, Colombia faced only mild sanctions over the last year and some feel that stance will continue.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not need any sanctions right now. We prefer it like this, we do not want it to get worse,&quot; Guillermo Mejia, Miami- based commercial director for Colombian all-cargo Tampa Airlines S.A.</p>
<p>But fears also are rising that the U.S. government might propose tougher measures such as a tax on flowers or other goods.</p>
<p>Colombian and trade interests have been lobbying, taking out advertisments in newspapers and organising forums to press their case with Washington. Spohrer said World Trade officials met Florida Governor Lawton Chiles, who in turn called Clinton to urge him not to impose sanctions on Colombia.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is sitting around biting their nails to see what happens,&quot; Spohrer said.</p>
<p>Any sanctions could pinch Miami and its airport. Colombia is Miami International Airport's biggest trading partner, with 227,000 tons of air cargo to and from Colombia, according to 1995 statistics from Metro-Dade Aviation Department.</p>
<p>Brazil is the next closest with one-third that amount.</p>
<p>Flowers are the largest single import at the airport, with 167,000 tons coming in in 1995, according to Metro-Dade Aviation.</p>
