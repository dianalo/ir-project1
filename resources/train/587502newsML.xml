<dateline>ALGIERS 1997-05-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Algeria's general election on June 5 comes more than five bloodstained years after authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election that Islamists were poised to win.</p>
<p>The years of bombs, massacres and political manouevring killed an estimated 60,000 people. Here are the landmarks on the path to the poll from which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) is excluded:</p>
<p>1992</p>
<p>January - President Chadli Benjedid resigns. Diplomats said he was ousted because the FIS led December's round of the general election. Half-finished election scrapped. Five-man High Council of State led by Mohamed Boudiaf set up as collective presidency.</p>
<p>February - Violence begins, state of emergency declared.</p>
<p>March - Court outlaws Islamic Salvation Front.</p>
<p>June - Boudiaf killed. Ali Kafi takes over one week later.</p>
<p>July - FIS leaders Abassi Madani, Ali Belhadj sentenced to 12 years jail each for subversion. Shooting erupts in Algiers.</p>
<p>August - Bomb kills 10, wounds 124 at Algiers airport.</p>
<p>1993</p>
<p>January - First executions of Moslem fundamentalist activists. Emergence of Armed Islamic Group (GIA) to rival FIS armed Islamic Salvation Army.</p>
<p>July - Retired army general Liamine Zeroual appointed defence minister. He pledges dialogue with all to end strife.</p>
<p>September - First foreigners, two Frenchmen, killed by Moslem rebels. More than 100 die in months that follow.</p>
<p>October - GIA gives foreigners to Dec 1 to leave. Thousands flee as attacks, especially on French, increase death toll.</p>
<p>1994</p>
<p>January - Kafi steps down as president, Zeroual succeeds.</p>
<p>May - Authorities set up Transitional National Council, a quasi-parliament to overlook proposed laws.</p>
<p>August - Zeroual starts dialogue with five opposition parties. Talks boycotted by leading secular parties who accuse president of trying to reach deal with fundamentalists.</p>
<p>October - President breaks off talks with FIS, accusing it of intransigency. Announces presidential election to be held.</p>
<p>December - GIA gunmen hijack Air France plane in Algiers. Three passengers killed. Plane stormed in Marseille, hijackers die.</p>
<p>1995</p>
<p>January - Suicide car bomb in central Algiers; at least 42 dead, nearly 300 wounded. Armed Islamic Group claims attack.</p>
<p>November - Zeroual wins Algeria's first multi-candidate presidential poll. Moderate Islamist party leader Mahfoud Nahnah come second.</p>
<p>1996</p>
<p>March - Seven French monks kidnapped. Found dead in May.</p>
<p>May - President unveils plan for proportional representation, two-chamber parliament and ban on parties using Islam to gain power. Promises general election in 1997.</p>
<p>November - Twenty people killed in night attack on village, setting pattern for series in which hundreds are murdered. Late in month, referendum approves proposed political reforms.</p>
<p>1997</p>
<p>January - Zeroual announces election for June 5. Four days later, Algeria's most powerful UGTA union leader, Abdelhak Benhamouda, assassinated. He had announced he planned to form his own party to compete in poll.</p>
<p>January-February - More than 300 people killed in attacks during Moslem holy month of Ramadan ending Feb 9.</p>
<p>April - Moslem rebels kill at least 93 people, including 43 women and girls, in worst single massacre of five years.</p>
<p>May 15 - Campaigning starts for election, preceded by an overnight massacre of 30 people south of Algiers.</p>
