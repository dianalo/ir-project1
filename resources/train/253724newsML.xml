<headline>RTRS-Freak hail storm hits Australian wine town.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-12-12</dateline>

<p>A freak storm lasting only about 10 minutes, but which send down a shower of hailstones some the size of tennis balls, swept through a town in one of Australia's major wine growing areas overnight, leaving one man dead.</p>
<p>Singleton, 150 km (93 miles) northwest of Sydney, was on Thursday declared a natural disaster area after hundreds of homes, a school and hospital were badly damaged by the storm, said New South Wales state government minister Richard Face.</p>
<p>The Insurance Council of Australia said the damage bill from the ferocious hailstorm in the Hunter Valley, a major wine growing area, was expected to be tens of millions of dollars.  </p>
<p>&quot;We'd expect it to be big,&quot; said Terry McMullan, executive manager of the council.</p>
<p>Most injuries were minor, but one man was killed when he lost control of his car after its windscreen was smashed by hail and hit a tree.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a devastating storm,&quot; said Face, the minister responsible for the Hunter Valley.</p>
<p>&quot;There were hailstones as big as tennis balls. Some people collected them and put them in freezers,&quot; he told reporters.  </p>
<p>&quot;But it was not just the size of the hail but the ferocity with which they came down because of the winds and torrential rain. They stripped trees and smashed the entire roof of a school and forced the evacuation of a hospital.&quot;</p>
<p>A convent had some 200 windows smashed and a nearby church lost all its valuable stainglass windows.</p>
<p>However, the storm had a narrow path and there were no reports of damage to vineyards.</p>
