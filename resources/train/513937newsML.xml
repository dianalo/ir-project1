<p>French bond futures finished MATIF pit-trading flat on Wednesday after an early technical push fizzled out and the consequent retreat was accentuated after strong U.S. industrial production data.</p>
<p>Thursday's key external influence will be the release of German Ifo business confidence index, expected at 0800 GMT.</p>
<p>Early short-covering and a technical push to test the 129.32 50 percent retracement level between the year's highs and lows failed to stimulate buying in the June 10-year future early in the day, after which the contract started sliding, traders said.  </p>
<p>Market optimism following an inflation-benign U.S. consumer price report on Tuesday gave way to renewed speculation about a U.S. rate hike in May after the release of March industrial production data showed a rise of 0.9 percent versus expectations in the market of a 0.6 percent increase.</p>
<p>Many expect a slowdown in the United States in the second half of the year but see a risk of turbulence from strong U.S. figures before that.</p>
<p>Traders said there was little activity in the cash market in Paris and that futures were looking to other markets for direction.  </p>
<p>PIBOR three-month interest rate futures also lost ground in the afternoon, with the June contract settling two basis points lower at 96.68.</p>
<p>Yields on the 5.50 percent OAT due 2007 stood at 5.71 percent, versus 5.70 on Tuesday, with the spread showing no divergence from its German equivelent at minus 13 basis points.</p>
<p>From inside France, the market will also feel the influence on Thursday morning of the auction of 22-24 billion francs of BTANS, the 4.75 April 12, 1999 note and the 4.75 March 12, 2002 BTAN.</p>
