<p>Polygram NV president and chief executive Alain Levy said on Wednesday that the company expected to resume profit growth this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are optimistic that we will return to earnings growth,&quot; Levy told a news conference, talking about the outlook for 1997.</p>
<p>However, he said it was too early in the year to specify the level of growth the company was expecting.  </p>
<p>Polygram said that it would be shedding a total of around 550 jobs as part of a previously announced restructiuring of its music business. The company said last October that it would cut around 400 jobs under its $90 million restructuring.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer Jan Cook said the restructuring would pay back in the next two or three years. He said the job cuts would trim the annual wage bill by 50 million guilders.</p>
<p>Earlier, the international music and film group reported a fall of almost 18 percent fall in 1996 earnings. Net income after extraordinary items dropped to 608 million guilders from 741 million guilders in 1995.</p>
<p>PolyGram took a post-tax charge of 114 million guilders for the reorganisation of its music operations in the results.</p>
