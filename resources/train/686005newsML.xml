<p>Genetic-engineering can help palm oil erode the market share of soybean and olive oils, an expert said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Scientists in the United States have modified canola oil to make it look more like coconut oil for industrial use,&quot; Nam-Hai Chua, chairman of the scientific advisory board at the National University of Singapore, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;They are encroaching on our market share and we have to mount a response,&quot; he said in an interview on the fringes of an international food conference in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Chua, who is also head of the laboratory of plant molecular biology at Rockefeller University in New York, said there was a general perception that the high content of saturated fatty acids found in palm oil was not good for health.</p>
<p>&quot;Six-seven years ago, there was a negative campaign by the soybean growers of the United States against Malaysian palm oil,&quot; he said. &quot;They were using it as a competitive measure.&quot;</p>
<p>He said bio-technology could be used to reduce the acid content in palm oil and raise its mono-unsaturated fatty acid level to make its properties similar to olive oil.</p>
<p>&quot;Then the health issue will no longer be valid and they (soybean growers) will have to think of other things, while you expand greatly the product use of palm oil,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Indonesia is the world's top producer of palm oil after neighbouring Malaysia. Palm oil is used to make cooking oil, soaps and detergents, cosmetics and fabric softeners.</p>
<p>Chua said bio-technology can help countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia harvest different sorts of products with higher value and expand their market share.</p>
<p>&quot;Palm oil can compete with temperate oils, and can begin to erode the market share of olive oil and soybean oil,&quot; he said, adding that bio-technology can no longer be ignored when considering business issues.</p>
<p>&quot;It can reconfigure the supply chain,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said breakthroughs in genetic-engineering of plants were just the tip of the iceberg, adding that there would be waves of second and third generation products.</p>
<p>Bacteria-resistant rice plants, vegetables with longer shelf-lives and flowers that bloom longer are some of the many advances chalked up through genetic-modification of plants.</p>
