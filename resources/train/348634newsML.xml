<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Friday with most institutions unwilling to trade in the last session before the Chinese Lunar New Year, traders said.</p>
<p>Total turnover fell to 2.69 million lots from 2.75 million lots. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>The most active three-day contract fell sharply to 3.98 percent from 37.4 percent on Thursday, probably due to the appraoch of the long annual holiday, one trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The holiday mood dominated the market, resulting in dull trade today,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>&quot;The absence of new issues and listings on the A share markets also helped today's dive,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The repo rates were likely to go up after the two-week holiday as trading on the market by state-owned banks has been banned, traders said.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up with institutional support for better sentiment in the last session before the holiday, traders said.</p>
