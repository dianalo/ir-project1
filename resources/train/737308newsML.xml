<p>Austria's ATX index on Thursday rallied to its highest close since the index was recalculated in January 1991, thanks to demand for a handful of market heavyweights -- particularly OMV and VA Stahl.</p>
<p>Traders forecast the market would remain buoyant although the expiry of July futures and options contracts on Friday could temporarily weigh on prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Many tried today to roll over their positions into August. That'll continue tomorrow,&quot; said one trader, confident of a smooth expiry.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's not all rolled over, then there could be a bit of selling pressure at expiry,&quot; cautioned another.</p>
<p>The ATX index added on 22.95 points, or 1.63 percent, to 1,429.29 -- just off the day's high at 1,431.28. Of its constituents, 18 advanced, one fell and two were unchanged.</p>
<p>OMV was the most actively traded issue, gaining 2.81 percent to 1,683 schillings on turnover of 112,830 lots.</p>
<p>Steelmaker VA Stahl led ATX gainers, up 3.76 percent or 23 schillings to record a new high at 635. Cartonboard maker Mayr-Melnhof also recorded a new high, up 3.24 percent at 670.</p>
<p>Insurer Wiener Staedtische was the sole ATX decliner, albeit losing just 0.05 schillings to 1,094.95.</p>
<p>The broad-based Vienna bourse index added on 6.07 points or 1.2 percent to 511.92</p>
<p>The July ATX future jumped 16.4 points to 1,432 on turnover of 2,463 contracts.</p>
