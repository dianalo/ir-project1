<p>American Greetings Corp., the No. 2 greeting card seller in the United States, Wednesday said it would overhaul its largest greeting card line in a bid to reflect changing demographics.</p>
<p>The &quot;All New American Way&quot; marketing strategy will replace 80 percent of the birthday and everyday cards offered by the company, putting more than 100 million new cards in store shelves over 16 months beginning in July.</p>
<p>The new cards will reflect multiculturalism, changing attitudes toward aging and changing family dynamics, the company said.</p>
<p>For example, American Greetings will introduce smaller note-sized cards that can be slipped into a child's lunch box. In addition to traditional &quot;Get Well&quot; cards, it will make cards that express words of encouragement to someone with a long-term illness.</p>
<p>New multicultural everyday cards, with phrases such as &quot;Muchas Gracias&quot; will also be included, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said the new marketing strategy is based on changing lifestyle and demographic trends.</p>
<p>&quot;These emerging trends are changing consumer attitudes and will drive purchasing decisions going forward,&quot; said American Greetings President Edward Fruchtenbaum. &quot;This is a magnitude of change in greeting cards seen only once each generation.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said it does not expect the overhaul to affect earnings.</p>
<p>Analysts had been expecting the overhaul and noted that the greeting card industry was essentially a fashion business that keeps changing.</p>
<p>&quot;Every year, they freshen up probably 30 percent of their line anyway,&quot; said Rudolf Hokanson, an analyst who follows the company for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. &quot;Now they're going to do 80 percent in one swoop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a marketing announcement,&quot; he said. &quot;It just tells me the company's continuing to do (its) job.&quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, Cincinnati-based Gibson Greetings Inc. the No. 3 greeting card maker which is in the midst of overhauling its offering, chided the industry for being out of touch.</p>
<p>&quot;When a major company in the industry says that 80 percent of their product line is incorrect, it tells me how far away this industry is from its consumer,&quot; said Gibson Chief Executive Frank O'Connell.</p>
<p>Everyday and birthday card sales accounted for 44 percent of American Greetings' $2.16 billion sales in 1996, compared with 22 percent for holiday cards, which will not be affected by the change, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said it will roll out its marketing plan next year when the cards will arrive in stores.</p>
<p>American Greetings fell 12.5 cents to $33.75 on Nasdaq.</p>
