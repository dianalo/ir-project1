<p>NOTES: (a) In the second quarter of 1996, Guess recorded a non-recurring reorganization charge of $3.6 million ($2.1 million or $0.05 a share, on an after-tax basis) in conjunction with the company's initial public offering on August 7, 1996.</p>
<p>(b) Effective January 1, 1997, the company changed its method of accounting for product display fixtures located in its wholesale customers' retail stores, whereby the costs for such fixtures will be capitalized and amortized over five years using the straight-line method. In prior years, these costs had been expensed as incurred. The Company believes that this new method will more closely match the long-term benefit that the product display fixtures provide with the expected future revenue from such fixtures. The new method has been applied retroactively to product display fixture acquisitions of prior years. The effect of the change on the quarter ended and six month period ended June 29, 1997 was to increase earnings by about $0.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively (or $0.02 and $0.02 a share, respectively), excluding the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of $4.0 million (after reduction for income tax expense of $2.7 million) is included in earnings for six months ended June 29, 1997.</p>
<p>(c) Pro forma adjustments include the elimination of certain expenses in connection with the initial public offering and include (i) the reduction of salaries and bonuses paid to Maurice, Paul and Armand Marciano (the Principal Executive Officers), (ii) the decrease in depreciation and operating costs associated with an aircraft owned by the company which was sold in contemplation of the IPO, (iii) the elimination of the minority interest in Guess Europe, BV and Guess Italia, S.r.l. resulting from the merger of Marciano International with and into the company, and (iv) adjustments for Federal and state income taxes (about 40 percent rate) as if the company had been taxed as a C corporation rather than an S corporation. Prior to its initial public offering, the company was taxed as an &quot;S&quot; corporation and did not pay full corporate income taxes. For additional information regarding the nature of pro forma adjustments, refer to the company's Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>(d) For comparison purposes only, earnings per share amounts for 1996 are calculated on a fully diluted basis, whereby all of the shares outstanding immediately following the Company's initial public offering in August 1996 were considered to be outstanding at June 30, 1996. 1997 shares are the weighted average of actual shares outstanding during the first quarter.</p>
