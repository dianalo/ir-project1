<title>ZIMBABWE: ZIMBABWE MONEY RATES SOFTER AFTER TENDER.</title>
<headline>ZIMBABWE MONEY RATES SOFTER AFTER TENDER.</headline>
<dateline>HARARE 1996-09-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market slipped on Friday in sympathy with the benchmark treausry bill rate which came down at Thursday's weekly auction, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation rates dropped recently and obviously trading rates also had to come down in line with that,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Inflation fell to 17.7 percent in August from 22 percent in July, and analysts attributed this to a reduction in food prices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Friday, discount houses were taking up 91-day central bank paper at 21.46 percent, down from the 22.49 percent set at last week's tender, and were also selling them softer at 21.25 from 22 percent.</p>
<p>NCD bills maturing after 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought and sold lower at 23 and 22 percent respectively from Thursday's 23.5 and 22.75 percent while bankers acceptances slid to 21.75 and 21.25 from 22.75 and 22 percent across the board.</p>
<p>Call money shed half a percentage point to 21.50 percent in a market which opened with a surplus figure of Z$382 million from Z$600 million the previous day.</p>
