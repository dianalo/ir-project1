<p>Several thousand Rwandan refugees crossed into Rwanda from Tanzania on Friday while hundreds of thousands flooded back towards their camps after Tanzanian troops blocked them from moving deeper into Tanzania.</p>
<p>While some walked into Rwanda, thousands more broke through a Tanzanian army cordon around Benaco camp. Soldiers at first beat some with sticks but gave up when it was clear they had been overrun.</p>
<p>Earlier nearly half a million Rwandan and Burundian refugees trekked away from their camps near Tanzania's border with Rwanda to avoid being repatriated by the end of the month, a deadline announced by the Tanzanian government and UNHCR last week.</p>
<p>But confronted by roadblocks manned by Tanzanian troops, a vast tide of refugees turned back to their camps, only to find they had been sealed off by troops who at one point fired tear gas canisters to keep them on the road towards the border.</p>
<p>A UNHCR official, who declined to be identified, estimated some 5,000 crossed the border on Friday into Rwanda and another 300,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees were on roads heading back towards their camps which they had fled since Sunday.</p>
<p>It was unclear where the returning refugees would go but it appeared Tanzanian troops might put them all in Benaco camp, which had a population of some 162,000 before the exodus.</p>
<p>Hundreds of refugees dropped their bundles of belongings on the roadside and sprinted across vegetable fields to reach Benaco camp but many appeared resigned to going back to Rwanda.</p>
<p>Many Hutu refugees have said they fear reprisals or punishment for the 1994 genocide of Tutsis if they return to Rwanda but others have said they would be willing to return if they had no choice.</p>
<p>Refugees who wanted to sit down were told to keep moving. But the troops were good-natured and did not menace refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;A huge mass has just turned round, tens of thousands. They are heading north towards the border and Benaco camp. It is an absolutely incredible sight right to the horizon as far as you can see,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the World Food Programme (WFP).</p>
<p>&quot;The people we had been watching for the past 24 hours going southeast are now going north along the same road,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The refugees were loaded down with piles of belongings. One child sat on the handlebars of a bicycle clutching a duck.</p>
<p>Reporters estimated more than 100,000 refugees headed back towards Rwanda after setting out on what they said would be a marathon trek to asylum in Kenya or as far south as Malawi, 850 km (530 miles) away.</p>
<p>&quot;Go back to the camps and you will get fed. We don't want you here. We want you to go back,&quot; Tanzanian army Colonel Urbano Nguvumali told refugees on the road.</p>
<p>But thousands of refugees slipped away before the roadblocks were set up and it was not clear how the Tanzanian authorities would round them up and send them back to Rwanda.</p>
<p>The exodus had threatened a repeat of events in Zaire in November when over half a million Rwandan Hutus fleeing a revolt by Zairean rebels left camps to return to Rwanda while many fled or were driven by Hutu militia deeper into Zaire.</p>
<p>Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, appealed to Tanzanian authorities on Thursday to redirect the refugees back towards their camps but without using force.</p>
<p>Aid workers said it appeared the refugees, many of them elderly, turned back peacefully as the grip of Hutu intimidators over them had been broken once they left the camps.</p>
<p>U.N. officials, who had been in despair earlier on Friday at the exodus, were delighted as they watched the return flow.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very pleased to see a returning trend,&quot; said Anne Willem Bijleveld of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) in Ngara.</p>
<p>UNHCR blamed Hutu intimidators for the exodus.</p>
<p>The Hutu Interahamwe militia played a leading role in the 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis before being driven into exile in Zaire and Tanzania by Tutsi rebels who formed a new government. The Interahamwe fear reprisals if they return home and want to keep the mass of refugees with them in exile.</p>
