<p>The United States and Canada agreed on Monday to coordinate their domestic plans for getting rid of toxic chemicals from the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner and Canadian Minister of the Environment Sergio Marchi, meeting in Washington, also agreed to work together to find out how big a problem cross-border smog is and to coordinate environmental research.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes accord actually meshed existing Canadian and U.S. targets and deadlines for eliminating spills, run-off and emissions that deposit 13 dangerous contaminants, such as mercury and PCBs, in the lakes. But Browner called the agreement a &quot;milestone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's new is we both agree to meet the same targets,&quot; Marchi said at a news conference, adding that making the international commitment would put pressure on both countries to fulfill the targets.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes contain almost one-fifth of the world's surface fresh water and supply drinking water to almost half the 33 million people in the United States and Canada who live in the area, according to the EPA.</p>
<p>The cross-border air pollution agreement, along with other accords signed on Monday bolstering existing environmental cooperation, was less concrete than the water agreement, with no deadlines or targets for emissions curbs.</p>
<p>It called for the two sides eventually to reach an agreement on a scientific definition of the cross-border smog problem and then to identify solutions.</p>
<p>Canada's smog standards are far more stringent than existing ones in the United States and proposed new U.S. standards would not go far enough to stem pollution blowing into Canada, Canadian officials said.</p>
<p>Attempting to fend off criticism that Canada had backed down on its smog concerns, Assistant Deputy Environmental Minister Robert Slater said: &quot;It's a very deliberate step-at-a-time approach.&quot;</p>
<p>Marchi and U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt also signed an agreement to coordinate protection of endangered species that cross the two countries' border.</p>
<p>Environmental groups were quick to slam the accord, saying it would do nothing because Canada does not yet have its own law to protect threatened species, and legislation in progress would do little to protect wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement provides no legal protection for trans-boundary endangered species, and only reinforces the lack of protection on the Canadian side of the Canada-U.S. border,&quot; the U.S. Endangered Species Coalition and its Canadian counterpart said in a statement.</p>
