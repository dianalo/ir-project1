<p>The Singapore rubber market was thin at the close on Tuesday as some tire manufacturers engaged in a bit of shortcovering as the trade tried to shake off the effects of holidays in Japan and Thailand, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;One manufacturer bought some 300 tonnes from me for prompt shipment of RSS3 at 109 (U.S.) cents. That's about the biggest piece of business done this afternoon. Volumes were still pretty thin,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Another trader said Bridgestone and another tire producer was said to have bought some SIR20 rubber for forward shipment, but no further details were available.  </p>
<p>&quot;The deal was done. but I'm not sure at what price,&quot; a trader said, adding there was also some forward buying seen for TSR20 rubber.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't really much. The level of trades done remains on the thin side,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>A holiday on Monday in Japan and Thailand weighed on the market as players trickled back to their offices, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 0945 GMT, July RSS3 was seen unchanged at 109.25 U.S. cents a kg. July RSS1 was seen at 158.00 Singapore cents (US$1.09) a kg from 158.50 cents.</p>
