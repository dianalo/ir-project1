<p>The Russian equities market is certain to grow by hundreds of billions of dollars and commercial banks will play a strong role in that growth, Russian Finance Minister Anatoly Chubais said on Friday.</p>
<p>Chubais gave a strong nod towards a market where banks play a key role, creating German-style ties between banks and industry. This is already clear in Russian financial-industrial groups, but Chubais told a news conference Russia would develop on its own terms.</p>
<p>Chubais settled a turf battle for regulatory control of the securities market by giving the Central Bank the ability to license commercial bank activities as of January 1, 1998, effectively guaranteeing a strong bank presence in the equities market.</p>
<p>Current securities market licences for banks running until October will be extended to January, he said.</p>
<p>The settlement is part of an agreement reached on Thursday between the Ministry of Finance, the Federal Commission for the Securities Market, which wants full control of licensing and envisions a U.S.-style securities market, and the Central Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars of potential growth of the volume of the Russian equities market,&quot; Chubais told a news conference. &quot;The decisions taken yesterday make it possible to talk about that with certainty.&quot; Chubais said Russian stock market capitalisation could grow by dozens of times as new issuers came to market.</p>
<p>Russian market capitalisation has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year to $90 billion currently, chiefly on sharp price appreciation of a handful of leading shares. Chubais gave no time frame for his forecast.</p>
<p>He said new rules would abolish the division of regulation between the equities and other securities markets, clearing up uncertainty that had held back both investors and issuers.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody has shares, but no one has any funds,&quot; he said of Russian industry, stunted by a cash-flow and investment crisis.</p>
<p>He said commercial banks would be an important supporter of the shares market as in Germany, where banks have long-term relationships with companies in which they hold shares.</p>
<p>In the U.S.-British model stockmarkets are economic centres driven by active share trading by mutual fund and other large investors. German share markets are much smaller as many shares are held long-term by commercial banks.</p>
<p>About 60 registered financial-industrial groups linking major industries and banks already control a large part of the Russian economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russian system has characteristics copying those of the German system, I mean the real interest and the real positions of the commercial banks not only in credit activity but in acquiring shares,&quot; Chubais said.</p>
<p>He said the Russian market, with a trading system similar to the U.S. over-the-counter NASDAQ system, would develop uniquely -- and had far greater potential for growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russian securities market will be the best securities market in the world, and neither the German or the Americans have shown the potential for growth that we have already this year,&quot; he said.</p>
