<p>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will likely decide at a meeting Tuesday which of the state's power customers will be allowed to choose their electricity vendor, commission officials said.</p>
<p>The issue, listed on the CPUC's agenda for its meeting in San Francisco, is another key step by the state toward breaking up California's traditional utility monopolies by introducing open competition among power suppliers.</p>
<p>The CPUC must decide between allowing open access for all of California's electricity consumers in January or phasing in restructuring over a period of perhaps several years.  </p>
<p>Under state legislation passed last year, deregulation of the electricity industry must begin next January and be completed by January 2002, but details of how this is going to be implemented are being left to the CPUC.</p>
<p>In April, a CPUC administrative law judge issued a draft decision calling for across-the-board electricity deregulation in January.</p>
<p>But late last month, CPUC president Gregory Conlon issued an alternate timeframe for restructuring, which called for opening up just 1,800 megawatts (MW) of power generation to competition on January 1.  </p>
<p>This would be only about five percent of peak summer power demand, measured at about 35,235 MW in 1994, for PG&amp;E Corp, Edison International, and Enova Corp, the state's three biggest investor-owned utilities.</p>
<p>Conlon said he believed it was prudent to proceed slowly in the beginning to test the abilities of both the utilities and alternative suppliers to process customer requests.</p>
<p>His plan provides for a mid-1998 &quot;checkpoint&quot; to assess the market's progress, with January, 2002 as the worst-case deadline for full phase-in.</p>
<p>Conlon's proposal echoes the CPUC's original plan to gradually introduce open competition and is viewed favorably by Edison International and PG&amp;E.</p>
<p>In a filing to the commission, San Francisco-based PG&amp;E said &quot;some initial phase-in...would allow a smoother integration of new processes with ongoing customer service requirements during the winter storm season.&quot;</p>
<p>Two other commissioners on the five-member board, Jessie Knight and Josiah Neeper, have said publically they support allowing across-the-board deregulation in January.</p>
