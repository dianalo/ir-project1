<headline>FOCUS-Oil sideways but traders warn OPEC on cheating.</headline>

<p>World oil markets shuffled sideways on Wednesday as OPEC oil ministers met in Vienna and Iraq prepared to start exporting oil again.</p>
<p>But senior oil traders saw a chance of more prices falls if OPEC failed to plug at least some of the leaks in its much abused quota system.</p>
<p>Prices have already dropped 25 percent this year to $18 a barrel.</p>
<p>Brent blend crude oil, the world benchmark grade, was down six cents at $17.81 at 1255 GMT on Wednesday but was well above a recent 12-month low of $17.32.</p>
<p>OPEC heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Iran were turning up the heat on the cartel's biggest quota violator, Venezuela, to press it to cut excess production and help ratchet up prices.</p>
<p>The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is currently pumping some 2 million barrels per day (bpd) above it's self imposed ceiling of 25.03 million bpd.</p>
<p>But delegates at the meeting, which is expected to freeze the current ceiling for the next six months, doubt the pressure on Venezuela would have much impact.</p>
<p>&quot;OPEC is going to become important again in the future but they must act now to stop the cheating,&quot; said Bob Finch heading of trading at Vitol SA in London, the world's largest independent oil trading and refining company.</p>
<p>A failure to address overproduction at this meeting will &quot;almost certainly hit prices&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Iraq said it expects to resume exporting oil under a U.N. oil-for-food pact early next month, ending three weeks of uncertainty which had helped buoy sagging crude prices.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the accord implemented last December, Iraq is permitted $2.14 billion worth of oil over 180 days to raise money for food and medicine.</p>
<p>Iraqi exports during the first phase of the deal averaged 660,000 bpd -- equivalent to the output of OPEC minnow Qatar -- but could increase exports to around 740,000 bpd when the second phase starts.</p>
<p>If oil prices fall further, export flows from Iraq could increase and pile more pressure on to the market, said traders.</p>
<p>&quot;The market does not need, or want, a million barrels a day from Iraq right now,&quot; said Nigel Saperia, managing director of the oil trading division of Bankers Trust International in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The only positive thing from this OPEC meeting is if Saudi Arabia manages to keep its temper,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Brimming oil tanks are already beginning to weigh on prices for next winter.</p>
<p>In Europe and the United States, winter heating oil stocks are about 20 percent and 13 percent above year ago levels. And traders say the summer gasoline season in the West stalled at the starting line.</p>
<p>Even a large slug of unexpected oil demand from Nigeria this week failed to help prices.</p>
<p>But despite a bearish mood among many traders there are signs of better demand ahead.</p>
<p>Oil demand in Asia, eastern Europe, Latin America and China is booming and helping to offset more sluggish demand in Western industrialised nations.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris sees world oil demand putting in a big seasonal jump of 3.2 million bpd in the fourth quarter this year from the current third quarter.</p>
<p>But the IEA is less bullish on demand for the full 1997 year than OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia sees world oil demand rising some 2.5 million bpd this year, a Gulf source said while the IEA predicts a rise of just 1.8 million bpd.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia sees demand for OPEC crude at some 27 million bpd this year which is in line with estimates of current actual output, the Gulf source says.</p>
