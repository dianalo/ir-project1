<p>The London Stock Exchange faces the risk of losing capital inflows to its European neighbours if Britain remains outside of the European Monetary Union (EMU), LSE chairman Gavin Casey said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The exchange, Europe's busiest bourse, has not publicly stated its view on whether Britain should join the EMU.</p>
<p>Casey, expressing his personal opinion before a group at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, acknowledged that the international investment community may find London a less attractive place to do business if Britain doesn't join the EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are not in the first wave of the EMU and we show no intention of joining ... that could mean that more money will flow inside the Euro regime at the expense of the markets on the edge of it,&quot; he said. &quot;That is one of the dangers.&quot;</p>
<p>Casey said the exchange is planning for both scenarios.</p>
<p>If Britain opts out of the EMU, the LSE, which already employs a trading platform to account for a number of foreign currencies, will simply treat the EMU as another currency.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on what precise strategy the exchange will pursue to maintain its market share if Britain doesn't join the EMU. &quot;We'll adapt,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Casey, who took the helm of the LSE in June, after a bitter controversy over radical reforms forced his predecessor out, said the LSE will be &quot;as competitive&quot; as any other exchange once its programme to cut costs is fully implemented during the next year.</p>
<p>One major component of its strategy to reduce costs will be the introduction of the electronic order book in October, which will replace its system where market makers set prices.</p>
<p>Casey said he was hopeful that London will capture a sizeable portion of flotations resulting from the wave of privatisations sweeping across the globe.</p>
<p>The LSE already has a lion's share of international listings. At the end of 1996, the exchange had 536 depositary receipts, twice as many as New York.</p>
<p>Additionally, growth of emerging markets will translate into one trillion dollars worth of shares by the end of the century that will need to be listed and traded, Casey said.</p>
<p>&quot;It could bypass London or go through London,&quot; he added.</p>
