<p>Fast-rising Belorussian Vladimir Samsonov zeroed in on his first world table tennis title on Sunday by upsetting world number one and title-holder Kong Linghui to reach the final.</p>
<p>The lanky 21-year-old from Minsk inflicted a 21-15 21-18 17-21 21-17 defeat on the Chinese player, who also holds the Olympic crown, to earn a title tilt on Monday against former champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden.</p>
<p>Waldner, 10 years older than his opponent, defeated Yan Sen of China 21-17 21-14 21-12 to move within a match of adding a second world title to the one he captured in 1989. He also lost the 1987 and 1991 world finals.</p>
<p>Samsonov, who lives and trains in Duesseldorf, will go into battle with the memory of a 21-6 21-7 victory over Waldner in the team event last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he didn't sleep very well before that day because it was too easy. This will be much tougher, six and seven against Waldner, this is not known,&quot; Samsonov said.</p>
<p>Samsonov was as proud to win for Europe as he was to score his fourth victory over a Chinese player in the event.</p>
<p>&quot;Last time China won everything and I thought that could happen again but now we have an all-European final. This is important for the game,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kong, tired after a five-set quarter-final victory over compatriot Ma Wenge earlier in the day along with three doubles matches, could not stay with the 1.89-metre tall Samsonov in the first two games.</p>
<p>He bounced back to take the third, winning two of the best points of the match from 19-17 to force a fourth game. It was close all the way but Samsonov won five points on his own serve to move from 11-9 down to 14-11 ahead.</p>
<p>Kong got within a point at 17-16 but two forehand errors, a forehand winner from Samsonov and a backhand out of court by Kong ended it.</p>
<p>&quot;I played so many matches I was very, very tired. I couldn't concentrate,&quot; Kong said.</p>
<p>&quot;This was our fourth meeting and I won the other three but they were all very close.&quot;</p>
<p>In the earlier quarter-finals, Kong outlasted Ma 16-21 22-20 14-21 21-15 21-12 while Samsonov shredded the tough defence of Ding Song of China and won easily 21-13 21-9 21-10.</p>
<p>Waldner scored a 21-17 21-14 21-12 victory over 1993 world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien of France in the quarters and after beating Yan was asked how well he was playing and how long he could continue.</p>
<p>&quot;The game is developing every year and as I'm getting older I must be getting better,&quot; he said. &quot;When I cannot win the big tournaments, then I will stop.&quot;</p>
<p>In the women's final, world and Olympic champion Deng Yaping, 24, defeated compatriot Li Ju 21-12 21-19 21-7 21-12 and will face another Chinese in the final.</p>
<p>Her opponent will be 19-year-old Wang Nan, who subdued team mate Wu Na 29-31 21-10 21-16 21-15.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing special about her game except her experience,&quot; Wang said of her final opponent Deng.</p>
