<p>Stocks ended mixed on Monday as investors sold blue-chip shares to buy stocks of smaller companies, and bonds rose for the second straight session.</p>
<p>The dollar surged and the German mark tumbled after a Socialist victory in French parliamentary elections over the weekend raised doubts about Europe's proposed single currency.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 41.64 points to 7,289.40. Beyond the blue-chip market, however, gainers outpaced losers by 1,534 to 968 on volume of 432.6 million on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;We're continuing to see some rotation out of big stocks and into small stocks,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow has made a strong move over the last couple of weeks and it looks like some people are cashing in now,&quot; Ackerman said. &quot;There are a lot of economic numbers ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>Other broader market measures also rose. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks added 2.76 points to 383.52, the American Stock Exchange index, also weighted toward smaller stocks, edged up 1.79 to 607.17, and the Nasdaq index added 4.47 to 1,404.79.</p>
<p>Analysts said a slew of economic data -- including the monthly employment report due Friday -- probably would put a damper on demand for blue-chip stocks for the next few days.</p>
<p>Even after Monday's decline, the Dow stands nearly 900 points higher than it did April 11. In contrast, smaller stocks have only recently begun to shake off a malaise that had extended for more than a year.</p>
<p>If investors were cautious to start the week, that concern intensified with release of the week's first important economic indicator, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index.</p>
<p>The index, a gauge of manufacturing activity compiled by purchasers at about 300 major corporations, rose to 57.1 in May, soundly beating economists' forecasts for a 53.9 reading, as well as April's level of 54.2. A reading above 50 percent signals the manufacturing sector is growing while one below that level points to contraction.</p>
<p>Analysts said some of the strength appeared to be linked to special factors, such as the end of a strike at a Chrysler Corp. engine plant. But even after such factors, analysts said the index hinted that the upcoming jobs report would be a strong one.</p>
<p>The bond market largely shrugged off the report, and the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury climbed 3/32, or 94 cents on a $1,000 bond, reducing the yield to 6.90 percent from 6.91 percent at Friday's close.</p>
<p>The dollar jumped to 1.7305 marks from 1.7055 late on Friday, after rising to 1.7320 earlier, the highest level in almost a month.</p>
<p>The dollar edged up to 116.59 yen from 116.25, and made headway elsewhere as traders sold other European currencies amid the uncertainty over monetary union.</p>
<p>Coffee prices fell sharply for the second straight day as nervous speculators cashed in profits from a five-month rally.</p>
<p>At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, July futures closed down 22.45 cents a pound at 253.95 cents -- down 20 percent from last Thursday's high of 318 cents, the highest price for coffee since 1977.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index lost 58.5 points to 4,562.8, the biggest decline since a 65-point loss on April 1. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average rose 383.04 points or 1.91 percent to 20,451.85.</p>
