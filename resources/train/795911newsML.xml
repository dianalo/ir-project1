<p>Hungary's Ministry for Agriculture maintained its five million tonnes wheat crop forecast on Wednesday and said the quality of the crop would be better than some experts suggested earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;About 45 percent of the wheat will be above either euro or B1 standard,&quot; State Secretary Fulop Benedek told a news conference.</p>
<p>Both standards set a minimum protein content of 11.5 percent, Hungary's B1 milling wheat has to have a 28 percent gluten content while the euro requirement is 26 percent.</p>
<p>The euro standard also requires a certain starch to sugar ratio, indicative of germination, not included in the Hungarian standard.</p>
<p>He said 14 days of consecutive rains did lower the quality of the wheat crop but the damage was not as significant as sources outside the ministry suggested.</p>
<p>Milling wheat spot and futures prices rose some 45 percent over the last month due to worries that only a small percentage of an otherwise high wheat crop would be of milling quality.</p>
<p>December milling wheat futures rose to 30,180 forints per tonne on Tuesday from 22,400 forints on July 14 while the May 1998 maturity rose to 33,650 forints from 24,700 over the same period.</p>
<p>Benedek added that with more than 90 percent of the wheat harvesting done, he expected it to be completed this weekend, weather permitting.</p>
<p>He said Hungary's total grain crop will be between 12 and 13 million tonnes this year, over one million tonne more than last year's.</p>
<p>Benedek said Hungary's seed wheat supply was certain to be assured as the germination of seed wheat was between two and six percent and the 220,000 to 250,000 tonnes of raw seed wheat would satisfy domestic demand.</p>
<p>He also said spring barley harvesting was about 85 percent finished while rye and oat harvesting stood at 40 and 25 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>He said autumn barley was harvested from 166,000 hectares and the average yield was 4.1 tonnes per hectare, 40 percent above last year's figure.</p>
