<headline>Thai stocks close slightly up after listless day.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>Thai stocks edged slightly higher Monday after a flat day's trade saw most investors sidelined pending a policy statement by Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan and a meeting on US interest rates tomorrow, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET Index rose 0.09 points to close at 872.76. The SET-50 closed up 66.26 up 0.07 points on trade worth 2.368 billion baht.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very quiet today, what interest there was seemed to be local,&quot; said a senior trader at Dynamic Eastern.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think we were waiting for the Fed meeting, if it doesn't change tomorrow, and I don't think it will, we might see the SET up a little,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meets tomorrow to reassess US interest rates to which Thailand is especially sensitive given its rising current account deficit.</p>
<p>Few surprises are expected from a policy statement by Thai finance minister Amnuay Viravan tomorrow but with the Index near 42 month lows investors were not taking chances, traders said.</p>
<p>Among top stocks Krung Thai Bank lost 0.50 baht to 61.00, Thai Telephone shed 3.25 to 30.50 and IFCT put on two to 76.</p>
