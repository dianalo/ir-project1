<p>Russia's soccer championship reaches a tense climax on Sunday when Spartak Moscow, Alania Vladikavkaz and outsiders Rotor Volgograd bid to clinch the league title.</p>
<p>Alania and Spartak are joint top with 69 points after 33 matches and Rotor, two points behind in third place, have a mathematical chance of overtaking them if both slip up.</p>
<p>If two or all three of the teams finish level on points, an unprecedented play-off or play-offs will be required, regardless of goal difference.</p>
<p>Defending champions Alania have home advantage against seventh-placed Lokomotiv Nizhny Novgorod. Rotor are also at home to struggling Uralmash Yekaterinburg, who will be desperate for a win to avoid relegation.</p>
<p>Spartak, champions three times in a row between 1992 and 1994, have the hardest task with a difficult trip to ninth-placed Zenit St Petersburg.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the match of the season for Spartak. We absolutely have to get three points,&quot; said Andrei Tikhonov, Spartak's international midfielder and top goalscorer.</p>
<p>Spartak will need to lift themselves after being ousted from the UEFA Cup by Germany's Hamburg. Spartak drew 2-2 at home on Tuesday but went down 5-2 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Zenit, coached by former Russian national team chief Pavel Sadyrin, beat Spartak 2-0 in Moscow earlier in the season and have the added incentive of a promise of cash from St Petersburg city authorities next season if they finish in the top eight.</p>
<p>Alania are close to repeating their shock success of last season even though Vladikavkaz is only a few kilometres from Chechnya, the North Caucasus region where Russian troops fought separatists for almost 21 months until August 31.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no easy matches now. We'll go for victory and see if luck is with us,&quot; Alania coach Valery Gazayev said.</p>
<p>Rotor, who recently led the championship in a season in which the top three have regularly swapped places, are in a gloomy frame of mind after a shock 2-0 defeat last week which all but ended their hopes of a first league title.</p>
<p>Boris Bobrov, the league's general director, said no date had been set for a possible play-off or play-offs.</p>
<p>Leading standings (tabulate under games played, won, drawn,</p>
<p>lost, goals for, goals against, points):</p>
<p> Alania Vladikavkaz	   33   21   6   6   61   34   69</p>
<p> Spartak Moscow		 33   20   9   4   68   33   69</p>
<p> Rotor Volgograd		33   20   7   6   56   26   67</p>
