<p>Shares in Pace Micro Technology Plc were down 41-1/2p or 18.32 percent to 187 by 0838 GMT after the satellite and cable television equipment manufacturer's current trading statement disappointed investors, market makers said.</p>
<p>The company said it expected to achieve its original budget for this year but did not anticipate any &quot;over performance&quot; from new contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;The market had been hoping new deals in the pipeline would translate into better results but that doesn't seem to be the case,&quot; one market maker said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a pretty downbeat statement.&quot;  </p>
<p>Pace, which reported first-half pre-tax profits of 10.2 million stg versus 400,000 stg a year ago, said the strength of sterling had put pressure on selling prices and margins.</p>
<p>Although the company said it had hedged short-term currency positions, the pound's dramatic advance, had caused it &quot;to re-evaluate our approach to local currency pricing, purchasing and manufacturing,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Turnover in the first six months more than doubled to 117.6 million stg but the company said growth prospects in the second half of the current financial year were dependent upon broadcaster subscriber growth.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is particularly true in a number of the digital satellite markets, where the necessary package of attractive programming and receiver pricing incentives is not yet in place,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Last week Pace confirmed it was one of the candidates to manufacture digital decoders for BSkyB Plc, which plans to launch a 200-channel digital satellite service this autumn.</p>
<p>But Pace said that the satellite broadcaster had not advised it of firm plans for the service.</p>
<p>The company said margins in the first half due suffered due to start up costs but it expects them to improve in the second half through new product designs featuring higher level of integration and component cost reductions.</p>
<p>The company also reported a net trading cash inflow of 2.9 million stg.</p>
