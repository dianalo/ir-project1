<p>U.S. corporations continue to line up to bring deals to market as demand for corporate paper persists and issuers captialize on lower rates to finance debt, dealers said.</p>
<p>Among deals expected to come to market Tuesday is the Philip Morris $500 million 10-year A2/A rated note offering via Lehman Brothers. Price talk on the issue is 76 to 78 basis points over comparable Treasuries.</p>
<p>Another expected to tap the market is Mead with a $550 million multi-tranche debt deal, syndicate sources said.  </p>
<p>The four-part Mead deal is expected to consist of the following maturities, syndicate sources said:</p>
<p>--five-year issue</p>
<p>--20-year with price talk of 65 basis points over Treasuries</p>
<p>--40-year with price talk of 40 basis points over Treasuries</p>
<p>--50-year with price talk seen in low 80s.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of paper being put away,&quot; said one high-grade syndicate ssource. &quot;We just have to wait and see how these upcoming deals perform and that will set the tone.&quot;  </p>
<p>Mead's 40-year tranche is puttable in the 10th year, sources added.</p>
<p>Also on the new issue agenda is a $700 million multi-tranche investment-grade corporate bond offering from Sherwin-Williams via Salomon Brothers, sources said.</p>
<p>The company will sell $100 million three-year notes, $100 million five-year notes and $200 million 10-year bonds in a public deal.</p>
<p>The second part of the deal, which will be sold privately via a 144A offering, consist of $150 million in 30-year bonds and $150 million in 100-year bonds, sources added.  </p>
<p>Looking ahead, sources said Union Carbide Corp was getting set to bring a $250 million 30-year capital securities deal, callable in 10 years, as early as this week.</p>
<p>International CableTel Inc was expected to tap the private placement market with $300 million in 10-year 144A senior notes and $100 million in 144A preferreds due 2009 via Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities, sources said.</p>
<p>Also, TCI Satellite Entertainment was preparing to bring its $350 million two-part debut debt offering via joint lead managers Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities and Merrill Lynch.</p>
