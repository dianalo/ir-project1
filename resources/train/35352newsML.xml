<p>Dutch chemicals giant Akzo Nobel snapped up a loss-making viscose factory in east Germany in the early 1990s at a bargain price but prospects for textile production in the region are gloomy, industry specialists say.</p>
<p>Rather than investing an estimated 300 million guilders in a new plant, Akzo said it chose to buy Werk Elsterberg from East Germany's privatisation agency Treuhand for less than half that.</p>
<p>Five years on, the Elsterberg Werk textiles plant is still in the red, but hopes to make its first operating profit in 1997 on annual sales of around 75 million marks.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do our utmost, and everything goes all right, we could break even next year,&quot; said Moritz Gimpel, Akzo's viscose production manager said during a tour around the site.</p>
<p>Akzo and Treuhandsanstalt have invested 160 million marks to date in new assets for the completely depleted plant, which makes an annual 5,000 tonnes of viscose. A viscose price war has recently broken out in eastern European countries.</p>
<p>Akzo is tight-lipped over the amount of money it pumped into Elsterberg and how much came from Treuhand, but large subsidies were an inherent part of the country's privatisation programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Akzo paid no more than half of that 160 million, probably a lot less. That means it almost got it for free, but in return it has certainly agreed to be committed to the plant for a longer period,&quot; said analyst Nils van Elzelingen at NIB Strating.</p>
<p>Akzo might have second thoughts about its acquisition, as it has recently begun preparations to transfer labour-intensive viscose processing activities from its expensive West German and Dutch viscose plants to the Polish city of Gorzow.</p>
<p>East German wages are still only 65 percent of West German salaries, but they are rising. Polish labour costs are one-tenth of West German wages.</p>
<p>&quot;Polish labour is much cheaper, and so many companies are moving to Poland that it will inevitably become very attractive for textile producers. The future of textiles makers is not in (Western) Europe,&quot; Van Elzelingen said.</p>
<p>So far, Elsterberg has escaped plans for job cuts, but the processing jobs there would also be at risk if wages continued to rise, said Akzo's board member Friedrich Froehlich.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are able to agree a long-term wage contract with the unions, we could keep all jobs here in Elsterberg,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Production of viscose itself would not be moved from German and Dutch sites as labour costs in those units were less important, he said.</p>
<p>But Elsterberg, which has 460 staff, may be in the running to become the production site for a viscose-related fibre called Newcell that Akzo is developing with Britain's Courtaulds on the basis of that firm's lyocel cellulose fibre.</p>
<p>Froehlich said wages in Britain were similar to those in East Germany and location in Britain was also possible.</p>
<p>&quot;We keep our options open. We haven't taken a decision yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the German state of Saxony is trying to lure foreign investment to the region in an attempt to cut jobless rates from the current 15-20 percent of the workforce.</p>
<p>But Froehlich said Akzo had not yet talked subsidies with Saxony's prime minister Kurt Biedenkopf, who was guest of honour at an Akzo presentation in Dresden.</p>
<p>However, subsidies can only be a temporary solution said Van Elzelingen. &quot;This industry faces cut-throat competition. Akzo's diapppointing fibres results have shown that it is very hard to make a decent return for a European producer.&quot;</p>
<p>Akzo bought Elsterberg in 1991 because of its location in the heart of a textiles region and also because rivals were eying the plant.</p>
<p>Before Communist nationalisation in 1949, the site belonged to Vereinigten Glanzstoff-fabriken, which was later taken over by Akzo. After German reunification, the Saxon textiles manufacturing industry has largely collapsed.</p>
