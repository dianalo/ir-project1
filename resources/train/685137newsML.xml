<p>Gadzooks Inc said Wednesday that it expects sales and earnings for the second quarter ending August 2 to be less than current analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>The apparel company issued a news release saying sales through the first three weeks of June were not tracking at levels necessary to provide a strong lead-in for July, the most important sales month of the company's second quarter.  </p>
<p>The company said it would fall short of the analysts consensus estimate of $0.25 per share for the second quarter.</p>
<p>The company reported earnings of $0.18 per share for the second quarter of the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The company said that during the second quarter, there has been an abrupt shift in one of the key junior apparel fashion trends that had emerged strongly during the first quarter.</p>
<p>The company said it believes that store sales have also been hurt by its earlier decision to reduce overall inventories to boost inventory turns.</p>
<p>This, the company said, did not allow it to react quickly enough to fast-changing fashion trends during the quarter, such as the sudden surge in demand for young men's fashion tops.</p>
<p>The company said it is now &quot;aggressively increasing store-level inventories,&quot; including moving in back-to-school products earlier than last year.</p>
