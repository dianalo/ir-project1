<p>A caller identifying himself as a guerrilla commander on Saturday promised in a live radio broadcast that all the roughly 340 captives hostages trapped in the Japanese ambassador's residence would be set free on December 24.</p>
<p>&quot;On the 24th at 10 at night absolutely all the hostages will be freed,&quot; the man, who identified himself as &quot;Comandante Evaristo&quot; said on air in what the Radio Programas del Peru station described as a call from the besieged Japanese embassy residence.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already had a very concrete meeting with the peace commission, now we are requesting they send us large bottles of water because water is short,&quot; the caller added. &quot;We are treating the hostages as prisoners of war.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no way to verify the information but Radio Programas told listeners the caller was the same person who had spoken earlier to them from the residence.</p>
<p>Red Cross spokesman Roland Bigler told Reuters minutes after the call that his organisation had not been able to establish whether it was genuine.</p>
<p>Police sources said earlier they identified &quot;Commander Evaristo&quot; as Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, the leader of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).</p>
<p>They said he led MRTA rebels who stormed the residence last Tuesday, taking prisoner a glittering array of diplomats and government officials.</p>
<p>The call took Peru by surprise as no breakthrough in the four-day-old crisis seemed imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;Evaristo&quot;'s promise came as the ordeal for the hostages in Peru dragged towards a fifth day with no sign of serious negotiations about ending it.</p>
<p>As a top doctor said the dignitaries held captive inside the Japanese embassy residence in Lima faced a possible cholera epidemic from their foul conditions, President Alberto Fujimori's government stuck to its hard line.</p>
<p>Red Cross spokesman Bigler told Reuters earlier in the day that as far as he knew, no serious negotiations had started between the two sides about ending the siege.</p>
<p>&quot;You can act as an intermediary only with those who want to be connected,&quot; Bigler said.</p>
<p>Talks about humanitarian issues such as supplies of food and water have been going on but Bigler said he knew of no government message to the guerrillas via the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Well known for his strongarm tactics, Fujimori turned down all of the MRTA's demands.</p>
<p>For their part, the roughly 20 heavily armed rebels repeated Friday night they would not give in until the government set free more than 400 of their jailed comrades, some of whom are serving life sentences.</p>
<p>As a gesture of good faith the guerrillas released a group of 38 hostages on Friday night into the arms of frantic, weeping relatives, some of whom hurled themselves onto the roofs of ambulances in their desperation to embrace their loved ones.</p>
<p>&quot;My prayers were heard, now we must keep praying for those who are still inside the residence&quot; said Jenny Bumachar, a relative of one of those released.</p>
<p>Victims still in the building Saturday were suffering from stinking overcrowded toilets, poor food, stifling heat and a lack of room after a fourth night sleeping on the floor in crumpled and smelly suits, Red Cross officials said.</p>
<p>Repeating earlier fruitless appeals, hostages early on Saturday thrust up to an embassy window signs begging the government to allow running water to be reconnected.</p>
<p>To pass the long hours inside, the guerrillas organised discussions with the captive ambassadors and government officials on political topics, released hostage Manuel Romero told local media.</p>
<p>Rebels allowed small field toilets to be taken inside to relieve bathroom overcrowding, Red Cross coordinator Jens Amlie said. The guerrillas earlier refused to allow portable toilet cabins to be set up in the grounds of the residence.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori, closeted with generals and security advisers, gave no sign of relaxing his hawkish stance.</p>
<p>He has not made any public comment since the crisis broke but did meet a small group of local newspaper editors on Friday in private to say he had no plans to even talk to the rebels.</p>
<p>Apparently contradicting that statement, Congress president Victor Joy Way said on Saturday in a television interview that the government &quot;had ruled out military action&quot; to end the crisis and was negotiating &quot;serenely and peacefully.&quot; He did not mention police action or the use of force in general.</p>
