<title>UK: Crude tanker rates little affected by Iraq news.</title>

<p>Crude oil tanker rates failed again to move significantly on Tuesday despite fresh news of imminent Iraqi sales under a recent oil-for-food deal, brokers said, but they painted a bearish picture for many routes.</p>
<p>&quot;Iraq has not had much impact,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>A senior oil official at Turkey's Tupras said a tanker would load Iraqi oil out of Ceyhan on December 13-14 but brokers said they had not seen any fixtures out of that port.</p>
<p>Iraq is expected to export some 600,000 barrels per day from Ceyhan and the mideast port of Mina al Bakr. Loadings at the latter were expected delayed until late this week.</p>
<p>Rates for million-barrel and two-million barrel vessels moving from West Africa to the U.S. Gulf were easier and chartering activity was slack. Rates for the smaller vessels were assessed at around W90 and Suezmaxes at around W105.</p>
<p>&quot;I think rates should stay weak because owners are keen just to get their ships fixed for Christmas,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Rates for 250,000 tonne Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) moving from the Mideast to Japan were stable at W62.5 while Mideast/Singapore numbers were closer to W50.</p>
<p>BP fixed the 300,000 tonne Alamoot for the Mideast/South Africa journey and paid W45, which brokers said was softer.</p>
<p>Mideast/South Korea routes were weak, too, and the fixture of the 253,000 tonne Flandre at W54 represents a fall of some three points from last week.</p>
<p>Caribs/upcoast U.S. routes for 70,000 tonners were steady and worth around W150. This compares with W110 paid by Agip for the 74,000 tonne Bona Spray taking fuel oil from Puerto Miranda to Italy. UK/Cont rates for 80,000 tonnes were steady and fixtures were seen at or below W100.</p>
