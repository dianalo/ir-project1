<p>American Israeli Paper Mills (AIPM) said on Wednesday that falling paper prices combined with the delayed effect of lower raw material prices caused profit margins to fall sharply in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The company, an Israeli maker of paper and paper products, also had lower earnings from its Hogla paper products subsidiary after selling a 49.9 percent stake in it to Kimberly-Clark Corp last June.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, AIPM reported that third-quarter net profit fell to 8.62 million shekels from 16.04 million in the year-earlier period, although revenues rose to $284.19 million shekels from $277.22 million shekels.</p>
<p>Although quantity sales of writing and printing paper were higher in the three months, prices were down more than 30 percent, the company said. Prices for pulp declined from their 1995 peak of $1,000 a tonne to $500 in June 1996, but the company did not benefit because it was working off stockpiles accumulated when pulp prices were higher.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a significant gap between current purchase prices for pulp and the average price of stockpiled pulp,&quot; AIPM said.</p>
<p>As a result, AIPM saw a decline in operating profit to 15.49 million shekels in the quarter from 23.69 million shekels a year earlier. The operating margin fell to 5.45 percent from 8.54 percent.</p>
<p>Thanks to a 38.6 million shekel capital gain from the Kimberly-Clark deal, AIPM's nine-month net profit rose to 71.44 million shekels from 52.45 million shekels a year earlier. Without the gain, net would have been 32.8 million shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;The fruits of the strategic partnership are expected to be realised in the profit and loss statement only starting next year with the expansion of (Hogla's) product line,&quot; AIPM said.</p>
