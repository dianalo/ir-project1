<p>New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch said on Friday that business confidence was high and interest rates were falling because people expected the conservative National Party to lead the next government.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister is perfectly correct in saying businesses are relaxed about the election outcome -- they know National's policies are best for New Zealand and they expect Jim Bolger will still be prime minister,&quot; Birch said in a statement quoting an opinion poll in the National Business Review.  </p>
<p>The NBR poll showed 62 percent of voters thought Bolger would be the next prime minister, compared with nine percent for New Zealand First leader Winston Peters and five percent for Labour's Helen Clark.</p>
<p>Birch said all political polls also showed National would be easily the biggest party after the general election on October 12. &quot;Obviously, that puts National in the best place for determining the shape of the next government.&quot;  </p>
<p>Recent polls show the main opposition parties, while trailing National individually, may collectively gain a majority in the election, New Zealand's first under proportional representation.</p>
<p>Birch's comments follow repeated warnings by Bolger that a left-wing coalition would roll back reforms and bring economic turmoil.</p>
<p>Opponents have accused Bolger of scare tactics and countered that the financial markets appear relaxed, with interest rates falling in recent days and the New Zealand dollar sitting close to eight-year highs.  </p>
