<p>COFFEE -World market for March 26, 1997</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London closed firmer but off their highs following scale-up origin selling. The market was supported by news that Indonesia's coffee exports could come down by 10 to 20 per cent this year to around 4.3-4.7 mn 60-kg bags because of heavy rains and winds which pounded its coffee farms. March added $58 to close at $1,615 per tonne, while May closed $60 higher at $1,627 per tonne.</p>
<p>Arabica futures in New York ended sharply higher for the second day in a row with producers noticeably absent. After Wednesday's close, the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) said it its latest monthly report that the supply prospects for arabica coffee in the third quarter of 1997 continued to look tight and vulnerable to disruptions. The group lowered its estimate for the Central American 1996/97 crop to 15.4 mn 60-kg bags from its previous forecast of 15.8 mn bags.</p>
<p>ACPC estimated that world coffee availability could fall to 17.91 mn bags in the third quarter of 1997 from 18.37 mn bags in the same quarter a year ago. These figures underline that the supply tightness is likely to spill over into the second half of the year. March added 7.55 cents/lb to close at 186.85 cents/lb, while July closed 3.35 cents/lb higher at 172.00 cents/lb.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>ACPC - The original ACPC's 1996/97 (July/June) export program called for participants to limit their shipments of green coffee to 53.55 mn bags. In January, however, the ACPC's council, in a belated response to the slump in prices in the last quarter of 1996 cut this figure, even though the market was by then already rising strongly. At its meeting in Rio de Janeiro on January 23, the decision was taken to cut by 1.3 mn bags the export ceiling of 26.28 mn bags originally fixed for the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>Against the background of sharply rising prices the technical group is now recommending that only an 800,000 bag reduction is needed. The proposal from the group is that the 300,000 bag cut in the export allocation for arabica coffee (both washed and unwashed) that was decided in January in Rio should now be restored and that, additionally, Latin American producers of the washed type should be allowed to ship 200,000 bags more in the first half than originally agreed under the 1996/97 export program.</p>
<p>The cut of 1 mn bags in the January/June robusta allocation decided in January should still stand, the group says. Delegates said that the proposed changes in the ACPC's 1996/97 export program took account of the tighter market for arabica than robusta coffee this year, underlined by recent price movements.</p>
<p>In its survey of the crop situation in Brazil, the ACPC reports that current signs - particularly the high level of export - point to 1996/97 (April/March) output of 28 + mn bags, with forecasts for 1997/98 ranging from 18 to 27.5 mn bags. It says that its own local survey shows that there has been a steep decline in the productivity of older trees, which is largely weather- related, but that new plantings and trees stumped immediately after the damaging mid-1994 frosts appear to be very productive.</p>
<p>In its survey of consumption developments, the ACPC reports that shipments are running well above use - suggesting stock rebuilding at all stages of the pipeline. However, the ACPC is worried over the effects of price rises on consumption. It said a ten per cent rise in the real cost of coffee in the United States, according to the ACPC's estimate of the short-term elasticity of demand, translates into a two per cent reduction in consumption.</p>
<p>With the US prices to retailers up 25 per cent so far this year, it says, this implies a five per cent cut in consumption if the hike is fully passed on to coffee drinkers.</p>
<p>CANADA - Canada imported 218,710 bags of coffee in December 1996, 9.2 per cent more than was imported the same month the previous year. That brought total imports in 1996 up to 2.739 mn bags, 9 per cent more than was imported the previous year.</p>
<p>Main suppliers of green coffee in 1996 were Guatemala (210,600 vs 201,500 bags), Mexico (232,000 vs 122,100 bags), Brazil (303,500 vs 263,000 bags) and Colombia (477,400 vs 390,900 bags).</p>
