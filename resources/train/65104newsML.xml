<title>UK: Yugoslav debt talks delayed but no problems - source.</title>
<headline>Yugoslav debt talks delayed but no problems - source.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-19</dateline>

<p>A Yugoslav source on Thursday said the delay in talks with bankers on rescheduling the country's commercial debt was due to hitches in fixing dates, rather than any serious problem.</p>
<p>The two sides were expected to hold technical talks around September 14 before another full round of negotiations later this year.</p>
<p>But the Belgrade daily Nasa Borba said the discussions had been delayed indefinitely.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a delay in (bankers) going to Belgrade...it is a problem of getting the right dates in diaries,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;They need to get a meeting when everyone can attend. It (the Nasa Borba story) implies negotiations have broken down, and that is certainly not the case. It's a timing issue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Creditors last met Yugoslav officials in London in July to discuss rescheduling the $2 billion of commercial debt it inherited after the violent collapse of the former Yugoslavia five years ago.</p>
<p>The Belgrade newspaper quoted an unnamed source on the Yugoslav negotiating team saying that an advance team from National Westminster Bank, which is advising Belgrade, had asked for a &quot;more realistic&quot; document on the country's economic condition to present to the London Club of creditors.</p>
<p>Few bankers expected speedy progress in trying to reschedule the debt, nearly the last major East European commercial debt restructuring left to be rescheduled.</p>
<p>&quot;They aren't ready to talk about nuts and bolts, maybe just general terms. We don't anticipate anything happening this year of significance,&quot; said one trader, active in the Yugoslav secondary debt market.</p>
<p>Some of the major issues hanging over the talks are how Belgrade plans to share out former Yugoslav assets with the other successor republics and the question of its International Monetary Fund membership.</p>
