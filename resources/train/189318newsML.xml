<p>Shares of jeweller Tiffany &amp; Co slid a bit Thursday despite solid third quarter profits and higher operating margins. Although the earnings topped Wall Street expectations by two cents a share, they may not have met &quot;whisper&quot; numbers, analysts said.</p>
<p>The stock fell 2 to 36-1/8 after Tiffany posted third quarter earnings per share of $0.26. First Call had put Wall Street consensus estimates at $0.24. Tiffany earned $0.19 last year. Sales rose to near $211 million for the quarter compared to $188 million last year.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think there has been a lot of over-reaction in the retail sector over the last week or so,&quot; said Kimberly Walin, a Furman Selz analyst who tracks New York-based Tiffany.</p>
<p>Tiffany shares rose 1-1/2 on Wednesday ahead of the release of the third quarter earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps people expected more, but the quality of the quarter was fabulous. People are also very spooked about Christmas for all retailers. Tiffany was one of the few that had a good Christmas last year, and we think trends will hold up very well for them,&quot; Walin said.</p>
<p>She raised 1996 earnings estimates  $1.56 a share from $1.55 and bumped up 1997 profit estimates to $1.80 from $1.78.</p>
<p>Another analyst also speculated that investors may have been betting ahead of earnings that Tiffany would streak past the estimates and were disappointed by the results.</p>
<p>Tiffany said U.S. retail sales climbed 14 percent to $99.7 million in the quarter, and same-store sales in the United States rose 9.0 percent. For the year-to-date, U.S. same-store sales rose 11 percent.</p>
<p>Tiffany said its policy is not to comment on its stock price.</p>
