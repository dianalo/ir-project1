<p>The people of Northern Ireland feared for their children's future on Tuesday after a shaky lull in a long guerrilla war was blown apart by two carbombs at the heart of Britain's military garrison.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all sick about it,&quot; said a middle-aged shopowner in Belfast's Sandy Row area, where murals pay homage to Protestant guerrillas who fought and killed Catholics in the name of British rule until a truce two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;My daughter, she's 19 and she's driving about in her own car. Now every time she goes out about I feel afraid that she's going to be involved in a bomb scare.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel for the kids. We thought the kids were going to have a better future than we've had for the last 25 years, now it's gone,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A kilometre (mile) away on the Catholic Falls Road, British security forces checked vehicles in the morning rush hour.</p>
<p>Catholic Nationalists looked forlornly back at a peace that had passed and forward at the spectre of a Protestant backlash.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm 32, and the first six years of my life are the only time that I can remember when there were no bombs going off,&quot; said a man tensely as he walked to work.</p>
<p>&quot;I have three kids. I don't want them to go through the 26 years of what I went through -- and it's probably going to be worse.&quot;</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours after suspected Irish Republican guerrillas struck their first blow at a British army target in Northern Ireland since 1994, people on both sides of the religious divide prayed the region would not be thrown into new sectarian strife.</p>
<p>The Irish Republican Army (IRA), fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland, ended a 17-month truce last February with a wave of bombs which had targeted only mainland Britain.</p>
<p>No-one has claimed responsiblity for Monday's attack on the barracks at Lisburn, near Belfast, but British Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said the IRA was a prime suspect.</p>
<p>Ordinary Protestants said extremists loyal to British rule of the province might be on the verge of ditching their own ceasefire and striking back.</p>
<p>&quot;I really hope and pray that they won't but I think they will,&quot; the Sandy Row shopkeeper said gloomily.</p>
<p>During the dark days of unremitting guerrilla warfare, the IRA launched gun and bomb attacks on security forces and reduced town centres to rubble, killing Protestant and Catholic civilians alike.</p>
<p>Protestant extremists groups sent killer squads into Catholic neighbourhoods, striking at nationalists at random to undermine support for the IRA and strengthen the majority Protestants' ties with London.</p>
<p>&quot;My attitude now is if we're going to have a civil war, have it and get it over with, and whoever's left let them pick up the pieces,&quot; a gloomy Protestant man said doing his morning shopping.</p>
<p>In Catholic Andersonstown people were downcast by the bombing  &quot;The majority of people would be against it, but it was inevitable,&quot; said a woman at a bus stop.</p>
<p>She said Britain should have brought both Republican and Loyalist politicians into high-level talks immediately after the rival extremist groups declared their ceasefires.</p>
<p>Britain refuses to give the IRA's political arm, Sinn Fein, a seat in current multi-party political talks because the IRA refused to call a new truce.</p>
<p>A Catholic man in his 30s said Britain should have done more to save the peace. He hoped it could be rebuilt.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just the continuation of a war.</p>
<p>&quot;War can be called to halt any time, in the same way that war was called to a halt in the Middle East and South Africa, when those in positions (of power) have the will and the breadth of vision to deal with the concrete problems underlying the situation.&quot;</p>
