<p>A lack of strong investors has created a selective bankruptcy process for Slovak firms considered incapable of surviving, Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik told the economic daily Hospodarske Noviny on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply, we lack strong investors for launching the bankruptcy mechanism. The problem is that this economy cannot manage to pull even a solution of such big problems. We must proceed selectively,&quot; Kozlik told the paper in an interview.</p>
<p>He added that sales of troubled firms to foreign investors would not work because &quot;neither banks nor the state would then get their outstanding debt&quot;.</p>
<p>Despite a problem of mounting inter-company debt, companies rarely declare bankruptcy in Slovakia.</p>
<p>Last month, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said his cabinet intended to accelerate and simplify the bankruptcy process, and eliminate the corporate debt from the inside of the state, which may total as high as 75 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, the government agreed with a bill on the law on corporate revitalisation, setting specific untraditional forms, criteria, and strategies aimed at unleashing companies' economic potential.</p>
<p>The proposed revitalisation forms range from a debt deferment plan to debt relief, and a combination of the two. &quot;(But) we are not going to hand out anything,&quot; Kozlik said.</p>
<p>He said the bill is limited to problems which have occurred up to the end of 1996, and sets a three-year term for the government to proceed with the programme and another three-year term for the firms to complete their revitalisation projects.</p>
<p>The law must still be approved by parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time we distinguish between the fields this help is directed to. I presume we will support special (military) production, engineering companies. A special committee on the ministerial and bank president level will assess that,&quot; Kozlik added.</p>
