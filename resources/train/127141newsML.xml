<p>The European Commission is probing allegations that European producers of special steel are operating a price-fixing cartel, steel industry and legal sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Under investigation is the practice of adding to the price of special steel products an &quot;alloy charge&quot; to compensate for erratic movements in the price of nickel and chrome, which are used in the making of stainless steel.</p>
<p>The Commission had no immediate comment, but an industry source told Reuters a probe had started less than a year ago following complaints from users of special steel. Such users include the automobile, building and machinery sectors.</p>
<p>Avesta Sheffield AB, a 50-percent subsidiary of British Steel, said in its annual report earlier this year it was among the companies being investigated.</p>
<p>&quot;Discusions with the EU have taken place and are still taking place but they have not been to our premises,&quot; said Avesta spokesman Alf Wedmalm.</p>
<p>A Brussels-based antitrust lawyer said Commission officials had carried dawn raids at the premises of a number of companies. Avesta said it had not received any such surprise visit.</p>
<p>Besides Avesta, the most important companies in the special steel producing sector include Germany's Thyssen and Krupp, Usinor Sacilor's unit Ugine and Acciai Speciali Terni SpA which is controlled by Krupp.</p>
<p>The steel sector has been a Commission target before. In February 1994 the Commission fined 16 European companies a total 100 million European currency units ($120 million) for fixing the price and sharing the market for steel beams.</p>
<p>In the present case, however, the practice of fixing alloy charges is hardly secret and has been in place practically since the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in the early 1950s. The ECSC is one of the EU's founding institutions,</p>
<p>&quot;The practice has existed for 50 years&quot;, the source said.</p>
<p>A rise in alloy charges following a higher demand for nickel and chrome some 18 months ago appears to have triggered the complaints.</p>
<p>The industry source denied that producers were in a position to dictate the rules saying special steel users were powerful enough to influence prices on their own.</p>
<p>Outside the steel industry the Commission in 1994 also imposed fines totalling a record 248 million European currency units (Ecus) on 42 European cement producers and associations found guilty of operating a market sharing agreement.</p>
<p>Last July the Commission announced that it would reduce or drop fines for companies that would help it to bust cartels.</p>
