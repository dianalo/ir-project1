<p>Israeli shares ended slightly higher on Tuesday in selective trading as investors awaited fresh information, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 0.36 percent, or 1.08 points, to 303.85 on all-share turnover of 228 million shekels against 210 million shekels on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0.27 percent higher at 310.31.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is stabilising at the current level. We saw some profit-taking but the market did not decline because new money is coming in from the mutual funds,&quot; said a trader at Tachlit Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that by the end of the month the Maof will still be around 310 or slightly lower,&quot; the Tachlit trader said. &quot;Investors are also waiting to see what Neeman is going to do in the Treasury.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Yaacov Neeman, an attorney and former Treasury director-general, to the finance portfolio on Monday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is waiting for new information...particularly the release of the June consumer price index next Tuesday,&quot; said Baruch Glicksberg at Clal Insurance. &quot;Analysts predict that the CPI will rise by 0.6 percent. A lower rise would send the market upwards.&quot;</p>
<p>Glicksberg added that the shekel's decline at the end of June is not expected to influence the CPI.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors were afraid that a sharp decline of the shekel would lead to higher inflation but now it seems that the shekel is stabilising at 3.35-3.36 shekels to the dollar,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The shekel has lost 4.3 percent against the dollar since the government instituted changes in the exchange rate mechanism and the Bank of Israel slashed interest rates on June 18.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Bank Leumi, which gained 0.5 percent to 571 agorot on turnover of 12.9 million shekels; Industrial Buildings, which rose 3.5 percent to 704 agorot on turnover of 11.8 million shekels; and Bank Hapoalim, which closed unchanged at 779 agorot on turnover of 9.1 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.57 shekels)</p>
