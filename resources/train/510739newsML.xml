<p>Alaska on Monday joined a string of other states in suing tobacco makers, charging the companies have created more than $100 million in medical costs for Alaska and engaged in consumer fraud and conspiracy to conceal the addictive nature of their product.</p>
<p>The 150-page lawsuit, filed in Alaska Superior Court in Juneau, also charged that tobacco companies and their industry research groups used deceptive tactics to target teen-agers and contributed to the delinquency of minors, Alaska Attorney General Bruce Botelho said.</p>
<p>Botelho announced the lawsuit during a special joint hearing of the Alaska House and Senate Health, Education and Social Services committee in the state capital in Juneau.</p>
<p>Alaska has been considering such a lawsuit for months, but delayed filing it in order to determine the appropriate strategy, Botelho said. &quot;In candor, one of our major concerns was, as a small state, our ability to bring forward this action,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A key factor in the decision to file a lawsuit, Botelho said, was the recent move by Brooke Group Ltd's Liggett Group Inc., one of the companies named in Alaska's lawsuit, to settle complaints brought by other states and to make public internal documents about the dangers of tobacco,</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, the decision by the Liggett Group to turn state's evidence has just put it over the top, so that one would have to say it would have been irresponsible for us as a state not to join in this effort where we have an opportunity to recover substantial public monies that have been expended for the public health,&quot; Botelho said.</p>
<p>The defendants named in the lawsuit included R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a division of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. ; Philip Morris Cos. Inc. ; Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., which is owned by B.A.T Industries Plc ; Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Tobacco Co.; and the Liggett Group Inc.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also names as defendants industry research groups such as the Washington-based Tobacco Institute and the New York-based Council for Tobacco Research USA Inc.</p>
<p>Alaska's complaint came three months after four tobacco companies -- Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard and Brown &amp; Williamson -- filed a preemptive lawsuit against the state in U.S. District Court in Anchorage.</p>
<p>The lawsuit said any attempt by the state to try to recover federal Medicaid costs would be a violation of the companies' business practices and an unfair restriction of their business.</p>
<p>Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, a witness at Monday's hearing, said Alaska officials were wise to wait for other states to gather legal evidence in their cases against the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>He and other attorney generals pursuing similar lawsuits will aid Alaska's case, Woods said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all working closely together,&quot; he said. &quot;Anything we have in Arizona or Illinois or Texas or wherever, we will share with your attorney general here.&quot;</p>
