<p>The opposition Labour Party, strongly tipped to win Britain's general election by May, warned trade union allies on Tuesday against staging the kind of strikes that damaged its left-wing predecessors.</p>
<p>The party, now dubbed New Labour with a centrist appeal in competition with the ruling Conservatives, told working-class supporters to shun mischief-making industrial disputes.</p>
<p>Labour would not tolerate stoppages by &quot;armchair revolutionaries&quot;, employment spokesman David Blunkett said.</p>
<p>The party has been out of power for nearly two decades after having been politically torpedoed by waves of industrial unrest, led by left-wing militants.</p>
<p>The annual conference of the Trades Union Congress has touched off a bout of tough-talking about unionists from both Tony Blair's revamped Labour and the Conservatives of Prime Minister John Major, lagging 20 points in opinion polls.</p>
<p>The government said on Monday it was considering ways of curbing strikes and Labour said it,too, was studying the issue.</p>
<p>Blunkett, in a newspaper article written ahead of a key speech to top trade unionists, proposed stronger arbitration procedures to avoid costly strikes.</p>
<p>&quot;An incoming Labour government is not going to tolerate the activities of armchair revolutionaries whose only interest is disruption and who see disputes as an opportunity for mischief-making,&quot; he wrote in London's Evening Standard.</p>
<p>Blunkett said if Labour won the next general election, it would aim to &quot;foster a very different climate, one of cooperation which will prevent genuine disagreements erupting into strikes&quot;.</p>
<p>But if that failed, Labour wanted to see trade unions agree to settle disputes by arbitration rather than calling their members out on strike.</p>
<p>Strikes have been on the increase this summer, with both the Royal Mail postal service and the London underground disrupted by repeated one-day stoppages.</p>
<p>In a hint of government action, Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang said: &quot;We now think is it's time to go a little bit further, one more step, in the light of the way in which in monopoly services it is still possible for trade unions to hold the public to ransom.&quot;</p>
<p>Trade unionists dismissed as union-bashing Lang's statement, which newspapers said could mean a compulsory one-month cooling off period before a strike could be called.</p>
<p>Blunkett said the underground drivers' union and management were looking at setting up an arbitration panel that could meet to resolve problems before a dispute erupted.</p>
<p>He said that could be the model for a wider system.</p>
