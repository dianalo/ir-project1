<p>NWE gas oil prices were  weaker on Wednesday but trade was thin with volatile futures keeping buyers relaxed, traders said.</p>
<p>Bearish U.S. crude and gasoline stock builds sent futures markets tumbling in early trade and slack demand in Europe put pressure on barge and cargo differentials adding a further 50 cents to $1 to overall losses.</p>
<p>Traders said the API report for distillates was mildly bullish, showing a 1.1 million barrel draw in U.S. stocks, but benchmark gas oil futures fell around $3, tugged lower by weaker crude and NYMEX gasoline futures.</p>
<p>In the key ARA market brokers said supportive buying interest from one major was less evident today, adding to the general dearth of demand.</p>
<p>However, German inland traders said thin buying interest was fuelling strong competition for business and weaker ARA markets were allowing importers to remained competitive.</p>
<p>Premiums for prompt lifting barges eased around 50 cents to June IPE +50 cents/$1.50 a tonne fob Rotterdam with sellers of early June liftings heard around June IPE $1.50 a tonne fob ARA.</p>
