<p>Shares in Banco Popular undercut Spain's stock indices on Tuesday after first half results disappointed expectations, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>At 1010 GMT Popular was down 800 pesetas, 2.11 percent, to 37,200 while the Ibex-35 blue chip index was down 0.81 percent to 7,111.04.</p>
<p>Popular said first half attributable profit rose 4.2 percent to 31.41 billion pesetas from 30.13 billion pesetas.</p>
<p>Analysts focused on net interest income, which fell 2.9 percent to 86.75 billion pesetas, and customer loans, which grew 5.6 percent from end-1996 and 10.9 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>&quot;These results were below expectations...Financial charges have not decreased as quickly as we were expecting, and this has impacted the whole profit and loss account,&quot; said Javier Bernat, analyst at Inverban brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;While (key money) rates continue to fall or stabilise, it seems their net interest income isn't going to be one of the best,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Expectations that a pick-up on the consumer side of the economy would be translated into increased demand for loans seemed to be taking time filtering through.</p>
<p>&quot;What surprised us were customer loans, as they should be seeing better growth. Obviously it makes you more pessimistic,&quot; he said, adding that Inverban would likely revise down its target price.</p>
<p>&quot;In Popular everyone expected better results. The problem is in net interest income. Everyone said buy Popular because it would improve on consumer spending,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;But lower interest rates seem to be affecting them a lot, with narrow margins,&quot; she added.</p>
