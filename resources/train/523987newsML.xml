<p>Hansapank's consolidated results for the first quarter were welcomed by the market on Monday although traders said the rise in its shares may not go much further.</p>
<p>The bank's shares jumped on news it made a first quarter consolidated group net profit of 136.1 million kroons versus 52.5 million kroons.</p>
<p>The market responded positively to the news taking the stock to a high of 288 kroons versus 269.50 kroons. It was trading at 285 kroons by 1000 GMT, up 15.50 kroons.</p>
<p>&quot;The group figures are very good,&quot; Sander Danil, analyst with Tallinna Pank said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you take out extra-ordinary items such as the profit from share trading at the beginning of the year and the sale of the stake in Hoiupank, the subsidiaries' share of the profit is still quite large,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hansapank said that its subsidiaries also made profits in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The banking business made a profit 96.4 million kroons, its leasing operation 21 million kroons, its Latvian subsidiary 6.9 million kroons, the asset management company 8.4 million kroons and the insurance business 300,000 kroons.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures are very good and and it has positively affected the stock's price,&quot; said Urmas Ninne, equities trader with Hoiupank.</p>
<p>But traders said that the shares were not expected to move much higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Most the rise has already happened,&quot; said Gunnar Maemets, a trader with Forekspank.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expecting a correction later today to bring the quick rise back down,&quot; Ninne added.</p>
<p>In the long term also, it is expected that these first quarter results will be exceptional.</p>
<p>&quot;The second quarter results will not be as good as the first and they could be one quarter to one third lower than these figures for the first quarter,&quot; Danil said.</p>
