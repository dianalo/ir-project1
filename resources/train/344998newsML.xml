<p>Romanian electricity authority Renel plans to raise $100 million in the international bond markets, an official at Merrill Lynch said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch is lead manager of the deal, expected to be a five-year floating-rate note private placement.</p>
<p>Dealers said there could be a put after three years.</p>
<p>&quot;The structure is not finalised yet. Roadshows have been held in Asia, but the timing is not yet clear because it is a private placement,&quot; the Merrill Lynch official said.</p>
<p>The next public Eurobond by a Romanian borrower was likely to be for state bank Banca Comerciala Romana which announced plans for a deal last year.</p>
<p>It is due to issue a Eurobond for between $75 million and $100 million at three years, also via Merrill Lynch. Roadshows were likely to start within the next few weeks, dealers said.</p>
<p>Also in the pipeline are deals for the cities of Bucharest, Constanta and Brasov.</p>
<p>The Romanian government, which first tapped the bond markets in June 1996 with a $225 million three-year Eurobond, said in December it needed nearly $3.0 billion of external debt.</p>
<p>The central bank would raise loans for up to $1.5 billion and the Finance Ministry would raise the rest.</p>
<p>&quot;Romania is actively looking at the market, but have not decided which currency to tap,&quot; said a syndicate manager at a European bank. &quot;They may opt for a five-year dollar deal.&quot;</p>
