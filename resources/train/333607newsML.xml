<p>France's Giat Industries, as part of obligations to offset a $3.62 billion tank deal with the United Arab Emirates, will on Monday announce a new investment in a shipping firm, an industry source said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The UAE Offsets Group (UOG) and Giat will announce a deal under which the French weapons manufacturer will invest in an Abu Dhabi-based shipping company, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a shipping company that operates ships and carries goods internationally,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the firm had been operating for some time, but would not give its name or put a price tag on Giat's investment.</p>
<p>But the key question is whether the new venture will be able to inject sufficient momentum into Giat's drive to meet its hefty offset obligations, industry executives said.</p>
<p>Giat won a $3.62 billion UAE order in 1993 for Leclerc main battle tanks, making it the biggest offset player in the oil-rich Gulf Arab state that has emerged as a key customer in the international arms bazaar.</p>
<p>The industry source forecast the new shipping deal would enable Giat to meet between seven and eight percent of its offset obligation. So far, the company has met 40 percent of its requirements under the programme, he estimated.</p>
<p>Giat is required to complete its offset obligation by 2003. The company has launched several offset ventures that include a racing and polo club, an engineering systems and maintenance firm and a company to promote the use of natural gas.</p>
<p>Asked whether the new shipping venture would boost Giat's efforts to meet its obligations before the deadline, a Western diplomat said: &quot;It all depends on how profitable the company is. It's not the value of investment that counts, it's what they get out of it.&quot;</p>
<p>The UOG was launched in July 1990 when the UAE activated a plan to purchase billions of dollars worth of high-tech weapons.</p>
<p>It has since signed multi-billion dollar arms deals and major weapons companies from the United States, Britain and France have been in fierce competition for lucrative contracts.</p>
<p>But some firms say they are entangled in the programme's list of conditions and complain of a lack of investment opportunities in the UAE.</p>
<p>They cite, for example, a key demand that requires firms to invest in projects with local investors in 49/51 joint ventures that generate added value to the UAE over a period of seven years equivalent to 60 percent of the sales contract's value.</p>
<p>Firms that fail to do so are obliged to pay the equivalent of 8.5 percent of that 60 percent and are barred from doing business in the UAE.</p>
