<p>Greek metals trading firm Mytilineos got shareholder approval for a public offering of about 3.0 billion drachmas ($10.9 million) and the transfer of its shares to the bourse's main market.</p>
<p>The offering, which will take place around mid-July, will raise the company's share capital by 15 percent with an issue of 880,880 new shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The price will be close to the prevailing market price at the time,&quot; board chairman Vangelis Mytilineos told shareholders.</p>
<p>Issue advisors will be Midland-Pantelakis Securities and National Securities. Lead underwriters for the offering will be National Bank and Midland Bank-Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the offering will be placed with foreign institutional investors, he told Tuesday's annual shareholders meeting.</p>
<p>In accordance with Athens stock exchange regulations, current shareholders will waive their rights to participate in the issue. This is required when companies transfer to the main market, he said.</p>
<p>Mytilineos is presently a small-cap listing on the bourse's so-called parallel market.</p>
<p>Proceeds will help retire short term bank debt and will finance fixed asset investments in mines.</p>
<p>Management forecast sales will grow 70 percent this year to 43.4 billion drachmas from 26 billion in 1996. Pretax earnings will advance to 2.2 billion, up 77 percent on 1.24 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales have exceeded 19 billion in the January-to-May period and we expect to post first half turnover of 23-24 billion drachmas from 14 billion in 1996,&quot; Mytilineos told shareholders.</p>
<p>Noting that the new deals with Trepca mines have improved profit margins to about 5.0 percent, he said first half pretax earnings will more than double from 597 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The company will pay a dividend per share of 50 drachmas for fiscal 1996 versus 28 a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Assuring substantial quantities of metals from Balkan and eastern European countries boosted our sales abroad. Volumes were especially high in copper, lead, zinc and aluminium. Our sales abroad accounted for 31 percent of the company's turnover in 1996,&quot; Mytilineos said.</p>
