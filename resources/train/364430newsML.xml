<p>German shares ended bourse trade at a record closing level, as the strength of the dollar above the 1.66-mark threshold lifted the market and prompted market players into a flurry of buying activity.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index of German blue-chips ended floor trade up 33.87 points, or 1.09 percent, at 3,138.01 points in early floor trade.</p>
<p>Dealers were surprised by the strength of the dollar, which continued to rise over the session amid expectations of no major changes in economic policy coming from this weekend's G7 finance minister's meeting in Berlin.</p>
<p>Traders were also focusing on the 1330 GMT release of U.S. jobless data for January, which could have an unsettling effect on afternoon trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>The main mover behind the index was the electronics giant Siemens AG which was among the volume leaders over the session and whose 3.50 percent rise drove DAX gains over the session.</p>
<p>The share ended up 2.90 marks at 85.80 marks after Bayerische Vereinsbank and Dresdner Bank raised their ratings on the Munich-based electronics group.</p>
<p>The group was boosted later on by news that it had won a 180 million mark order to supply equipment for the D2 mobile phone network of Mannesmann Mobilfunk.</p>
<p>Earlier on, Siemens said it had won a miblie telephone order worth more than 350 million marks in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Other corporate news early on was confirmation that the diversified utility Veba AG had ended its telecommunications alliance with Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless Plc.</p>
<p>Veba shares ended up 20 pfennigs at 91.70 marks, way off early highs, after saying C&amp;W would sell its 45 percent stake in Vebacom for 2.21 billion marks, and buy out Veba's half of C&amp;W Europe SA for 90 million.</p>
<p>Traders said Veba, which will also hold on to its 10.4 percent stake in C&amp;W, paid a fair price to buy out C&amp;W but were unsure to predict an outlook for Veba shares.</p>
