<headline>Gutfreund backs Optima's new Universal Bond fund.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Former Salomon Brothers supremo John Gutfriend has backed the launch of a new Universal Bond Fund from the Optima Group, to be marketed worldwide, which aims to offer equity-like returns but with the security of bonds.</p>
<p>Optima specialises in organising multi-manager diversified programs or single manager specialised funds.</p>
<p>This time it has linked up with Havell Capital Management run by Theresa Havell, until recently a partner at the New York-based money management firm Neuberger &amp; Berman where she built a $12 billion fixed income business over 10 years.</p>
<p>The fund is a dollar-denominated Bermuda-based investment company with a minimum investment of $1.0 million. It will be capped at $400 million &quot;to enable us to remain nimble&quot;, Havell said. The initial offer period closes on December 16.</p>
<p>Gutfreund said he had been impressed by Havell's strategy of building a highly diversified portfolio with modest leverage.</p>
<p>&quot;I get many ideas offered to me but this seemed to be common sense backed up by a proprietary trading model that is a little different,&quot; he added. &quot;It could be especially successful when cold (market) winds start to blow.&quot; A portfolio run using the model has generated a cumulative return of 42.7 percent (net of proforma fees) between January 1995 and September 1996, against 19.2 percent for the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment Grade Index over the same period.</p>
<p>Fees are one percent management plus a 20 percent incentive fee with a &quot;high water mark&quot; which means that underperformance in any one year must be recouped the next year before the usual annual fees click in.</p>
<p>Havell said she analyses fixed income securities by credit, duration, volatility and currency. &quot;We identify some 30 &quot;cells' or sectors and our diversification means we are rarely invested in fewer than eight to 10 of these at any one time.&quot;</p>
<p>Investment grade holdings will be limited to one percent and subinvestment grade 0.5 percent of the fund and returns will be boosted by gearing, which is also restricted to 1.5 times the principal value of the fund, or around $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The optimal point of the yield curve is relatively low duration of two to three years and we will leverage up from there,&quot; Havell added.</p>
<p>The fund will take on US mortgage-backed bonds, investment grade in general, emerging market debt, supranational agency instruments and low investment grade paper in the US.</p>
<p>&quot;We also will take futures, options and currency forwards but not any synthetically derived securities -- we would prefer to construct those ourselves,&quot; Havell said.</p>
