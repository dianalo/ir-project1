<title>CHINA: Shanghai copper ends sharply up on LME gains.</title>
<headline>Shanghai copper ends sharply up on LME gains.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shanghai copper futures continued the rises of the past three days on Thursday in active trading due to heavy overight gains on the London Metal Exchange (LME), traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on Wednesday night had little impact on the futures markets.</p>
<p>The most active May 1997 contract ended at 23,130 yuan ($2,788) per tonne, rising 420 yuan. It opened at an intraday low of 22,900 and hit a high of 23,240.</p>
<p>March rose 380 to 22,800, April 360 to 22,950, June 420 to 23,130, July 430 to 23,120, August 630 to 23,190.  </p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 71,580 tonnes from 38,010.</p>
<p>Copper opened higher on stop loss buying triggered by overnight LME gains but profit-taking limited any further rises, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Firmer futures prices on the world market pushed Shanghai copper up but the possibility of a correction is greater after the continuous rises earlier this week,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Open interest did not rise in line with the prices, and this would show little potential of further rises,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;There were expectations of increases in domestic demand and firmer prices on the world market,&quot; a second trader said. &quot;Many investors thinks copper will rise further in the mid-term despite the possibility of corrections.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts expected copper to stay strong in the mid to long term despite those correction concerns.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended up following copper's trend. March rose 60 to 15,470 yuan per tonne, April 50 to 15,800, May 90 to 16,000 and June 10 to 16,100.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 1,180 tonnes from 1,720.</p>
