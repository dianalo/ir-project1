<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices on Monday were expected to stay steady amid directionless talks as Chinese demand appeared to be dwindling, traders said.</p>
<p>Cash 180-cst cargoes for loading in October were bid/asked at $115-$118 per tonne on Friday.</p>
<p>China currently has fewer enquiries as it has already purchased about three to four fuel oil cargoes for delivery in October over the past two weeks, a trader said.  </p>
<p>Indications into South China market were heard at between $125 and $126 per tonne on a cost-and-freight (c-and-f) basis. Traders said increased supplies from Kuwait has placed a cap on any potential price rise while the usual supplies were expected from Iran, they said.</p>
<p>The major who was seen bidding for cargoes on Friday might bid again to cover its requirements for power utilities, traders said.</p>
<p>Some traders noted that the market has been very quiet in the past week as major players were not bidding or offering aggressively in the market.  </p>
<p>October paper, was bid/asked at $115.25/116.00, little changed from Friday's quotes at $115.50/$116.00.</p>
