<p>Two people were killed and 65 injured when a gravel truck rammed into a moving train in central Taiwan late on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;The truck driver, identified as Chen Cheng-chin, 33, was killed instantly, while two cars of the train were derailed because of the impact,&quot; an officer told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>One of the train's 200 passengers was killed, police said. Five were critically injured.</p>
