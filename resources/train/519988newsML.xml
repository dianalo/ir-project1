<p>LIFFE wheat firmed in thin volume, pumped up by May/July spreads, traders said.</p>
<p>July was most active, with 189 of a total 545 lots. It last traded 1.35 stg higher at 101.50.</p>
<p>But much of the volume consisted of 100 lots of May/July done at a 3.00 stg spread, one trader said. &quot;It's been a bit of a dull day,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The market got its reaction to Thursday's EU decision to halt the weekly open market wheat export tender out of its system quickly. The reaction was not necessarily what the EU commission, eager to prevent domestic prices rising too much, wants.</p>
<p>&quot;If anything it was a bit bullish,&quot; the trader said. He pointed out that the EU move confirms traders' view that the weather is a major factor in the market. The very fact that the EU is moving to put a lid on strong prices underlines their strength.</p>
<p>The end to the weekly tender is not much earlier than normal, he said, so it will not necessarily do much to increase domestic availability.</p>
<p>Steady markets in France and elsewhere helped keep prices up, although there was some late profit taking. And there has still been no real rain, the trader said.</p>
<p>Barley trade was limited to 15 lots, 10 of them on November, which last traded 0.30 stg higher at 96.00 stg.</p>
