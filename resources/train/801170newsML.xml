<p>Kyushu Oil Co Ltd, the sole refiner on Japan's southern island of Kyushu, said on Thursday that it had raised the capacity of its crude distillation unit (CDU) by 6,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) to 142,000 bpd.</p>
<p>&quot;We received government permission for the expansion in mid-July, and have started operations with the increased capacity,&quot; a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>Kyushu Oil is one of the five refiners in Japan that has received approval from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to expand crude distillation unit (CDU) capacity this year, a ministry official said.</p>
<p>The four other refiners are Tonen Corp, Taiyo Oil Co Ltd, Kygnus Sekiyu Seisei KK and Kyokuto Petroleum Industries Ltd.</p>
<p>Tonen will raise the capacity of the No 1 CDU at its Kawasaki plant by 15,000 bpd to 80,000 bpd while the unit is closed for routine maintenance work in September.</p>
<p>The topper is expected to resume operations with the expanded capacity in early October.</p>
<p>Taiyo Oil plans to raise the capacity of its two toppers at the Kikuma plant on Shikoku, the smallest of Japan's four main islands, by a total 10,000 bpd.</p>
<p>The capacity of the first topper will be raised by 8,000 bpd to 67,000 bpd later this month, and the second CDU by 2,000 bpd to 32,000 bpd in September.</p>
<p>Kygnus Sekiyu Seisei raised the capacity of its topper at the Kawasaki plant, near Tokyo, by 10,000 bpd to 80,000 bpd in June.</p>
<p>Kyokuto Petroleum's 143,000 bpd topper at its Chiba plant, which is currently closed for routine maintenance, is scheduled to resume operations on August 16 with a greater capacity of 155,000 bpd.</p>
