<p>APAC TeleServices Inc shares fell nine at 12-1/2 at mid-day Monday after reporting first quarter earnings that were below the consensus and warning that results for 1997 will be hurt by a major contract.</p>
<p>&quot;They missed their quarter,&quot; GS2 Securities analyst John Larson said.</p>
<p>APAC reported earnings of $0.18 a share, up from $0.10 a year ago, but below the First Call consensus of $0.20 a share.</p>
<p>Larson added that APAC management told a conference call they are &quot;not uncomfortable&quot; with a 1997 revenue estimate of $380 million, which is below the prior consensus.  </p>
<p>Larson said he did not have an exact consensus estimate for 1997 revenues, but said he believed the Street had expected revenues for the year &quot;a little above $400 million.&quot;</p>
<p>APAC's revenues for 1996 amounted to $276.4 million. It earned $30.6 million or $0.64 a share in 1996.</p>
<p>APAC said certain costs related to a large outsourcing client hurt first quarter results, and warned that the contract would hurt revenues, margins and earnings for the balance of 1997.</p>
<p>Larson said the large client is United Parcel Service of America Inc, which was later confirmed by an APAC spokesman.</p>
<p>Larson said the UPS contract accounted for nearly 30 percent of APAC's first-quarter revenues.</p>
