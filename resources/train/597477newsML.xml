<p>Parliament in Ukraine on Tuesday scuppered hopes the former Soviet republic's 1997 budget would be passed this month by postponing reading the draft to June.</p>
<p>Deputies voted against a proposal by party group and committee leaders to stay in session for the final week of May instead of going to their constituencies as they do one week a month.</p>
<p>President Leonid Kuchma, addressing a meeting of industrialists and businessmen on Monday, again criticised parliament for resisting economic reforms and for being unable to pass the budget and a tax reform package underpinning it.</p>
<p>Parliament's deputy speaker, Viktor Musiyaka, said on Monday that faction and committee leaders had set up conditions to push through the budget and that it would be read at the end of May.</p>
<p>Ukraine needs the budget approved to pave the way for a three-year Extended Fund Facility loan from the International Monetary Fund worth $2.5-$3 billion.</p>
<p>The first budget draft was approved by deputies in December last year but sent back to the government for amendments.</p>
<p>The author of the tax reform package, Viktor Pynzenyk, has since resigned in anger at the failure to pass reforms and been replaced as Deputy Prime Minister for reforms by Serhiy Tyhypko, a dynamic young banker.</p>
<p>The cabinet beefed up Tyhypko's authority on Tuesday by making his decisions on reforms binding for legislative bodies, businesses and organisations.</p>
<p>Kuchma last week appointed Tyhypko head of a temporary central bank council whose goal is to secure conditions to ensure its monetary and credit policies are fulfilled.</p>
