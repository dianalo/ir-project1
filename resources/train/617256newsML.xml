<headline>FOCUS - Ymos sees brighter profits outlook.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>German auto parts group Ymos AG announced on Tuesday that net profits dipped 13 percent last year, but said the results were heavily affected by extraordinary income and costs and profits were set to improve.</p>
<p>Group net profit last year fell 2.4 billion marks ($1.4 billion) to 16.4 billion marks as sales rose seven billion marks to 957 billion marks.</p>
<p>Ymos, which makes metal door parts, interior fittings and injection parts, said the sale of its locking systems unit last year and high restructuring costs played havoc with its financial performance.</p>
<p>But the company said that in terms of operating profits, business was about to improve.</p>
<p>&quot;Ymos will end the 1997 business year with clearly improved operating earnings. However we will only return to profitable territory in operating business in 1998,&quot; Ymos said.</p>
<p>But despite the optimistic outlook, the company's major shareholder is continuing to consider selling its stake.</p>
<p>Ymos chairman Klaus Troester told a news conference steel maker Cockerill Sambre SA, is to decide by September on a possible sale of its shares.</p>
<p>Belgian group Cockerill owns 95 percent of the German firm and has said in the past it wanted to end its involvement in the auto business.</p>
<p>Troester said, however, he did not expect the company's share price to collapse if Cockerill goes ahead with the sale.</p>
<p>&quot;A short-term share crash is not to be expected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cockerill bought Ymos in February 1989 when the original owners of the company, the Becker and Wolf families, were unable to provide the company with sufficient capital.</p>
<p>Ymos said in the first four months of this year sales rose by 13 million marks to 207 million marks and pre-tax profits advanced by about 10 million marks.</p>
<p>The company did not release operating results for 1996.</p>
<p>The sale last year of its locking systems unit added 93.4 million marks to the group result, while earnings were reduced by high restructuring costs and spending on risk provisions.</p>
<p>Following the sale of its locking systems business, Ymos said it planned to achieve sales of 650 million marks in the current year.</p>
<p>Ymos shares last traded at 103.10 marks on Monday. No shares had been traded by mid-afternoon on Tuesday.</p>
