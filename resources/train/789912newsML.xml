<headline>AFFLUENT OVER-35S BOOST UK DEPARTMENT STORES-STUDY.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-11</dateline>

<p>Affluent over-35 year-olds' preference for shopping in department stores is driving a revival of this type of shop in Britain, according to a new study published on Monday.</p>
<p>The stores, often dismissed as outmoded, are  enjoying a renaissance and will continue to boost their share of the country's retail sales, said retail consultants Verdict.</p>
<p>&quot;Social and demographic changes will make department stores one of the most attractive and dynamic of retail sectors over the next five years,&quot; Verdict predicted in its latest survey of these retailers.</p>
<p>Last year total department store sales rose by five percent to 7.6 billion stg, and the leading firms increased their turnover by 6.6 percent, outpacing retail sales growth of 5.3 percent.</p>
<p>Verdict said more affluent over 35s, bored with mass market shops, were looking for the distinctive brands and high quality environment for their shopping activities offered by department stores.</p>
<p>But not all stores were joining in the upswing. Older shops with poor locations would remain under pressure, and further closures were expected, Verdict said.</p>
<p>But there would also be expansion, with as many as 15 major new stores opening over the next four years, it predicted.</p>
<p>John Lewis and Debenhams are the two market leaders, followed by House of Fraser.</p>
<p>Privately-owned John Lewis regained the top slot from Debenhams last year as strong like-for-like sales growth, plus expansion, pushed its market share up by 1.5 percent to 20.8 percent.</p>
<p>The firm is expected to increase selling space by another 15 percent over the next three years.</p>
<p>Debenhams, soon to be demerged from parent Burton Group Plc, has made progress by converting concession space to own-bought merchandise and from opening new stores.</p>
<p>House of Fraser, with 12 percent of the market last year, is in the process of tailoring its products more closely to its customers.</p>
<p>Verdict expects the chain to expand its selling space over the next four years.</p>
