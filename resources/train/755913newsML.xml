<p>Belgian Filip Dewulf overcame second-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov 7-5 7-5 in the quarter-finals of the $535,000 Generali Open on Friday.</p>
<p>Tenth-seeded Dewulf, who recorded his only ATP Tour win at the 1995 CA-Trophy in Vienna, will next meet Spain's Galo Blanco who beat Austria's Stefan Koubek 6-7 6-2 6-4.</p>
<p>Saturday's other semifinal will be contested by the Czech Republic's Slava Dosedel and Julian Alonso, a 19-year-old Spaniard making his third appearance in an ATP tournament.</p>
<p>World number six and 1996 French Open champion Kafelnikov also lost his quarter-final battle in Stuttgart last week against Spain's Alberto Costa.</p>
<p>The Russian, sidelined for four months at the beginning of the year after breaking a finger in his right hand, said: &quot;This year is not going as well as I imagined.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I only won a single tournament (at Halle last month). So, I'm not really looking to what position I finish the year in the rankings.&quot;</p>
<p>Kafelnikov made a strong start against 10th-seeded Dewulf and led 4-1 before his form began to waver and he dropped serve at 4-3. The pair then exchanged breaks until showers interrupted play at 5-5.</p>
<p>After the rain Dewulf  broke for 6-5 and took the set on serve. The Belgian began the second set with a quick break but dropped serve twice to trail 3-5.</p>
<p>A then weary looking Kafelnikov failed to hold his serve twice and handed Dewulf the match.</p>
<p>Dosedel eliminated ninth-seeded Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay 7-5 6-4, while Alonso beat Argentine Hernan Gumy 4-6 6-3 7-6.</p>
<p>Dosedel, who on Thursday sent top seed and local hero Thomas Muster crashing, will be making only his second semifinal appearance in 1997 after Munich.</p>
