<p>Two Mexican army officers went on trial on Tuesday for alleged negligence in the deaths of 14 soldiers who died on a desert survival course in July, officials said.</p>
<p>The two officers -- a captain and a lieutenant -- face charges of &quot;abandoning their command&quot;, Gen. Eulalio Fonseca, commander of the northern military region where the incident took place, told reporters.</p>
<p>A patrol of 39 soldiers under the command of the two officers, whose names were not revealed, got lost in the desert region known as Laguna Salada near the city of Mexicali in late July during survival training.</p>
<p>Fourteen of the soldiers, aged between 18 and 21, died of dehydration in the exercise. Temperatures in the region can reach above 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p>&quot;They have to look out for people, follow people closely, to evaluate them at the end of the course,&quot; Fonseca said, describing the officers' responsibilities on such courses.</p>
<p>TV station Hechos said the officers could face the death penalty under Mexican military law. Defence Ministry officials were not available to discuss the sentence the two officers could face.</p>
