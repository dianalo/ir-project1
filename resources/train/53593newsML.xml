<p>Greek depos and forex forwards were fluctuating narrowly in late unexciting dealing and ecu/drachma eased after the central bank's fixing where players bought 80 million ecus, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Depos and forex forwards are steady in late dealing,&quot; a money dealer at a foreign bank said. &quot;Ecu/drachma eased after the fixing where 80 million ecus were bought by banks.&quot;</p>
<p>Drachma liquidity is tight and traces forex developments, the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank tries to dissuade banks from going long ecu, short drachma by keeping the ecu/drachma stable which negates the interest rate differential,&quot; he said. &quot;The Bank of Greece knows that drachma liquidity is tight and tries to help that way.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bank of Greece drained overnight liquidity at 12.40 percent.</p>
<p>All late polls showed the two major parties, the conservatives and the socialists, tied in first place with smaller parties holding on to gains recorded in earlier polls.</p>
<p>The crucial debate between Prime Minister Costas Simitis and conservative leader Miltiadis Evert is going to take place tonight.</p>
<p>Early elections will be held September 22 but the market has taken a positive attitude towards them on the ground that the winner will have no option but to follow Greece's EU convergence plan.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 159.20/30 drachmas from Friday's 159.320 fix, the dollar at 240.69/79 drachmas from 240.940 and the Ecu at 301.16/20 from 301.500 drachmas.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 12.15-12.55</p>
<p>** T/N at 12.25-12.75</p>
<p>** S/N at 12.30-12.80</p>
<p>** One week at 12.40-12.90</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 12.50-13.00</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 12.50-13.00</p>
<p>** One month at 12.50-13.00</p>
<p>** Two months at 12.50-13.00</p>
<p>** Three months at 12.50-13.00</p>
<p>** Six months at 12.60-13.10</p>
<p>** Nine months at 12.80-13.30</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 13.00-13.50</p>
