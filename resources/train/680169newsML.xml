<p>Japan's Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka will visit China on Tuesday, aiming to mend ties between the two nations after recent spats and explain what was discussed at the recent Group of Seven (G7) nations' summit.</p>
<p>&quot;This year is the 25th anniversary of the normalisation of Sino-Japan relations, so naturally, his agenda is to confirm or strengthen ties between the two countries, particularly on the economic side,&quot; a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Also minister Mitsuzuka is certainly prepared to explain the discussions that took place in Denver,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka, who attended the summit meeting of G7 leaders in Denver, Colorado, from June 20 to 22, is scheduled to hold talks with top Chinese officials during his four-day trip.</p>
<p>He will meet with Chinese Premier Li Peng, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and central bank officials in Beijing and then travel to Shanghai where he will meet officials before heading back to Tokyo on Friday, MOF said.</p>
<p>Although there is speculation that China will be the next nation to join the G7 after Russia's participation this year, ministry sources said that inviting China into the circle would be too premature and that the topic would not be discussed.</p>
<p>Japan is the only Asian nation in the elite grouping, which also includes the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Germany.</p>
<p>This will be the first visit by a Japanese finance minister to China in two years, since Masayoshi Takemura's trip in 1995 when China was struggling to rein in inflation.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka's trip follows a recent series of diplomatic visits by Japanese state ministers, a sign of willingness on both sides to work harder to improve relations, officials said.</p>
<p>Trade Minister Shinji Sato went to China earlier this month, offering Japan's support to its long campaign to gain membership in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), while urging Beijing to open up its markets further for an early entry.</p>
<p>In March, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda went to China to sign an agreement to lift a ban on grant aid imposed by Tokyo in protest at Chinese nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is expected to visit China around September, with Chinese premier Li paying a reciprocal visit to Japan afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst is over. We can't deny that the relationship with China was awkward last year. Although individual issues are yet to be resolved, the relationship has improved considerably since last year,&quot; a diplomatic source said.</p>
<p>Relations between the two worsened last year amid disputes over a contested island group in the East China Sea and Hashimoto's visit to a controversial Tokyo war shrine.</p>
<p>The disputes, along with friction over Chinese nuclear weapons testing, the Japan-U.S. security pact, China's missile tests and war games off Taiwan, had helped drive relations to what Japanese officials called their lowest ebb since 1972.</p>
<p>Japanese officials said that Mitsuzuka will not bring up diplomatic issues, although the Chinese side may do so. The talks are expected to stick to economic issues, an area where there is no noticeable friction, officials said.</p>
<p>The two sides will likely discuss economic conditions in both countries and in Asia, especially in regard to Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty from July 1.</p>
<p>They will also discuss bilateral economic relations, where Japan is China's biggest trading partner. Japan has been running a trade deficit with China, but this is partly due to Japanese firms' shifting of their output abroad, officials said.</p>
