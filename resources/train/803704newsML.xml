<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodia Khmer Rouge set alliance to fight Hun Sen.</title>
<headline>Cambodia Khmer Rouge set alliance to fight Hun Sen.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1997-08-15</dateline>

<p>Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas said on Friday they had joined forces with ousted co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh's senior military commander to fight the government's powerful leader Hun Sen.</p>
<p>In a report on their clandestine radio, the long-time propaganda mouthpiece of the Maoist movement, the rebels said Khmer Rouge and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had formed a joint military command with royalists fighting government troops in the northwest of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;On August 13, 1997, the national resistance forces...designated a joint general staff to fight the (Vietnamese) communists and their puppet Hun Sen,&quot; said the radio report monitored in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>It said the alliance included General Nhiek Bun Chhay, Ranariddh's senior military commander, and Ei Chien, the former Khmer Rouge commander who defected to the government last year.</p>
<p>Neither could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Ousted First Prime Minister Ranariddh's rag-tag forces have been fighting the government in the northwest since the prince and his royalist forces were overthrown by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, his coalition government partner, on July 6.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge have condemned the coup and broadcast frequent verbal attacks on Hun Sen, who was with the Vietnamese forces that invaded Cambodia in 1978 and later toppled the Khmer Rouge regime.</p>
<p>Ranariddh was negotiating with the rebels for several months and reportedly reached an alliance with them just before Hun Sen's July 6 power grab.</p>
<p>Late last month, the guerrillas purged their infamous leader, Pol Pot, in an apparent effort to sanitise their image and any alliance with Ranariddh.</p>
<p>Ranariddh, whose name was not mentioned in Friday's broadcast, is in Thailand and was not available for immediate comment.</p>
<p>The United States has condemned any future political role for the Khmer Rouge, under whose 1975-79 rule more than a million Cambodians died of overwork, torture, execution, starvation or disease.</p>
<p>Ranariddh, eager to court international support, has said he will not cooperate with the rebels.</p>
<p>But royalist troops said on Thursday they were fighting alongside Khmer Rouge rebels in O'Smach, the last major town held by opposition forces.</p>
<p>Hun Sen's forces have pressed closer to O'Smach in recent days and on Thursday the powerful leader ordered his army to seize O'Smach immediately.</p>
<p>The fighting alliance between royalists and Khmer Rouge mirrors their partnership in the 1980s, when they were part of an opposition force fighting a Vietnamese occupation forces and Hun Sen's Hanoi-backed government.</p>
<p>The rebels signed a peace agreement in 1991 that paved the way for U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but later reneged on the deal and fought a low-intensity guerrilla war against the coalition government that emerged from the poll.</p>
<p>Hun Sen and Ung Huot, Ranariddh's replacement as first prime minister, flew to Beijing this week to seek the blessing of Ranariddh's father, King Norodom Sihanouk, for the new government.</p>
<p>Ung Huot told reporters on his return to Phnom Penh that they had won endorsement from Sihanouk who is in Beijing receiving medical treatment.</p>
<p>Sihanouk later said he had not given his blessing and that, by law, Ranariddh was still co-premier with Hun Sen.</p>
