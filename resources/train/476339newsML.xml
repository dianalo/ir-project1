<p>The dollar could go for a rollercoaster ride this week, buffeted by key economic data, concerns about Wall Street stocks and Japanese banks, as well as any remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin during his trip to Japan on Friday, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a very volatile week,&quot; said Dimitri Balatsos, president of Tesseract Partners Inc, a global investment advisory firm.</p>
<p>&quot;You have all kinds of numbers coming out in the U.S. and overseas,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Experts' views on how the dollar will fare turned partly on whether they focused more on the threat of higher U.S. inflation or the ailing Japanese banking sector.</p>
<p>The dollar, for all practical purposes, has &quot;topped out&quot;, said Balatsos, who also predicted the Federal Reserve interest rate hike last week is just the first of several.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation is not nearly as benign as many people had thought at the end of the year and as recently as a month ago because many people underestimated the underlying strength of the economy and the tightness of the labor market,&quot; he said.</p>
