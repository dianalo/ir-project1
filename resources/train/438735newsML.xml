<p>Hungarian customs officials seized over 80,000 cartons of American cigarettes worth $1 million hidden in two Macedonian-registered trucks on the Hungarian-Yugoslav border, an offical said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The cigarettes were discovered in two refigerated trucks, one which came through the border post of Roszke yesterday morning and one yesterday evening,&quot; customs spokesman Jeno Sipo told Reuters.</p>
<p>The first truck was carrying frozen peppers and the second a consignment of apples, he said.</p>
<p>Customs officials' suspicions had been raised by the fact that the goods, which were bound for Germany, were not being kept at freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>&quot;We were suspicious when we discovered the cargoes were being carried at zero degrees and not colder,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The two drivers, both with Macedonian passports, were being held pending further investigation, Sipos said.</p>
