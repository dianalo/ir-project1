<headline>Egypt paper slams U.S. senate panel on aid.</headline>

<p>An Egyptian government newspaper said on Friday &quot;blind bias for Israel&quot; had made a U.S. Senate subcommittee approve a foreign aid package with no money set aside for Egypt.</p>
<p>The daily al-Akhbar was referring to a decision on Wednesday by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations which meant that for the first time since Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, of the two only Israel would be assured of a share in the annual U.S. foreign aid budget.</p>
<p>Subcommittee chairman Mitch McConnell charged that Egypt was &quot;cosying up&quot; to Libya-- which is on the U.S. list of countries that supports terrorism -- through growing military, economic and political ties.</p>
<p>He also said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had undercut negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the West Bank town of Hebron and took the lead in suspending multilateral peace talks between Arabs and Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;The Senate subcommittee issued its decision based on blind bias to Israel that pays no regard to objective facts nor even to the interests of the United States itself,&quot; said al-Akhbar.</p>
<p>&quot;Senator Mitch McConnell was misleading and turned facts upside down when he said Egypt was delaying the peace process despite the fact that Egypt's efforts to boost peace are appreciated by world governments, particularly the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;The fingers behind this senator and the position of his subcommittee are not at all hidden but are clear and exposed for all to see. He must know that Egypt has been subjected to many pressures in its history but it never gave in and it never will,&quot; al-Akhbar added.</p>
<p>The Senate subcommittee's effort runs counter to the Clinton administration's policy of continued aid to Egypt, which received $2.1 billion last year.</p>
<p>The State Department, which would be free to provide aid to Cairo from the rest of the U.S. foreign aid budget, on Thursday stood by its request for more than $2 billion in aid specifically targeted for the Cairo government.</p>
