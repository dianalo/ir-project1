<p>Allstate Corp said Tuesday it continues to build its international insurance business overseas, with an eye to offering coverage in markets such as China and, potentially, Latin America.</p>
<p>&quot;These are what I'd call seeds,&quot; Allstate President Edward Liddy told reporters. &quot;In three or five or 10 years, we think they'll grow into something substantive. But they are not going to produce large amounts of revenue or large amounts of income overnight.&quot;</p>
<p>Allstate, which had operating income of $1.6 billion and revenue of $24.3 billion in 1996, is setting up a representative office in China.</p>
<p>&quot;In China, we're primarily interested in working with the Chinese government to formulate what the texture and look and feel of an automobile insurance market ought to be,&quot; Liddy said.</p>
<p>Allstate is also interested in the Indian insurance market, which is dominated by a state-owned life insurance company that may be privatized. &quot;We would very much like to help them do that,&quot; Liddy said.</p>
<p>In Asia, Allstate already has life insurance joint ventures in Korea and Indonesia, and two ventures in Japan to offer life insurance and auto coverage.</p>
<p>Liddy added that Allstate plans to set up an operation in the Philippines, mostly likely in 1998.</p>
<p>In other international markets, Allstate is looking to expand in Italy and Spain. It already offers auto insurance in Germany, selling products directly without agents.</p>
<p>Liddy said Allstate is not active in Latin America, but does see potential in that market in the future.</p>
