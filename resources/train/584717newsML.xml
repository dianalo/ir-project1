<p>June Brent crude futures prices were untraded at midday in Asia, but were indicated lower after API data revealed a higher-than expected rise in U.S. stocks.</p>
<p>June Brent on SIMEX was quoted at $19.25/$19.45 per barrel after London fell 10 cents overnight to settle at $19.62.</p>
<p>July was quoted at $19.15/19.45 compared with London's close at $19.46.</p>
<p>However, NYMEX crude futures were 29 cents down from New York at $21.08 after the American Petroleum Institute (API) data.  </p>
<p>After the close of New York trading, API said crude stocks rose in the U.S. last week 6.94 million barrels when a 750,000-barrel build had been expected. Gasoline stocks surged 6.5 million, against expectations of 1.0 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It's obviously API driven on ACCESS but the price fall is quite mild when you consider we have come up a long way,&quot; one broker said. June had gained almost $1 since last week.</p>
<p>Despite the NYMEX sell off, June was being supported at $21.00 -- the current intraday low -- with bids backed by healthy volumes.</p>
