<p>Differences between the West and non-aligned states over on-site inspections remained unresolved on Thursday as a two-week review of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention moved towards its close.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the West was hoping the final declaration to be issued on Friday would support a speeding up of negotiations to establish a system for verification.</p>
<p>&quot;We're making steady progress but there are still major points to be resolved,&quot; a Western diplomat said. &quot;We still hope to get there with a consensus final declaration.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States, keen to neutralise the danger of terrorists or rogue states using biological agents or toxins, wants agreement to be reached by 1998 for international experts to conduct on-site inspections of suspected programmes.</p>
<p>Biological weapons, often called &quot;the poor man's atomic bomb&quot; because they are cheap to make and disperse, include deadly anthrax and botulism.</p>
<p>But non-aligned countries, including Pakistan, have a different disarmament agenda based on non-intrusiveness. Many are keen to do away with current export controls while resisting the idea of on-site inspections under a future treaty protocol.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main issues is the question of export controls which the non-aligned want done away with. The Western Group doesn't accept that,&quot; the Western diplomat added.</p>
<p>Experts from many of the 138 states which have ratified the global treaty banning biological weapons are taking part in the regular review conference, held every four years.</p>
<p>During the talks, the United States has said it suspects 12 countries -- including Russia, China and Iraq -- of having active biological weapons systems at various stages.</p>
<p>Delegates are arguing over what to say in the declaration about two major infractions committed since the last talks in 1991 -- the discovery of Iraq's programme that year and President Boris Yeltsin's admission in 1992 that Russia had inherited an offensive biological weapons programme from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be difficult to say anything. If you mention one, you probably have to mention the other,&quot; a Western envoy said.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation is pushing hard for the conference declaration to strongly urge an adhoc group negotiating a legally-binding verification system to intensify its efforts.</p>
<p>The European Community has also endorsed a 1998 target date for the verification system to be in place.</p>
<p>&quot;The Western Group is keen to give the ad hoc group a boost and try to get it to intensify its work,&quot; a Western diplomat said. &quot;But there are those who are doing their best to water it down -- basically some non-aligned, Russia and China.&quot;</p>
<p>To be effective, an inspection regime for biological weapons would cover not only military but private research laboratories. The commercial secrets of pharmaceutical and biogenetic industries would have to be protected, according to diplomats.</p>
<p>Also to be addressed is a last-minute proposal by Iran which wants the Convention amended to formally prohibit the use of biological weapons -- which the Cold War era pact fails to do.</p>
<p>Many states have argued that the current text, which bans developing, producing, stockpiling or otherwise acquiring biological weapons, implicitly and effectively prohibits use.</p>
<p>&quot;We are fiddling with the wording on the Iranian proposal. It shouldn't be impossible to resolve,&quot; a Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;No decision will be taken on the amendment itself. What is under discussion is how to proceed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Britain's ambassador Sir Michael Weston has chaired the session and is due to give a final press conference on Friday.</p>
