<p>The U.S. space agency fuelled the space shuttle Columbia for launch on Tuesday, hoping to dodge Florida's notorious afternoon thunderstorms, officials said.</p>
<p>Columbia was to blast off from the Kennedy Space Centre at 1:50 p.m. EDT (1750 GMT), 47 minutes earlier than originally planned.</p>
<p>NASA managers took the unusual step on Monday of moving up the launch time because of a forecast for thunderstorms and rain showers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the opportunity to launch a little earlier to hopefully get out of town before the thunderstorms show up,&quot; shuttle programme manager Tommy Holloway said.</p>
<p>Early on Tuesday, launch controllers loaded the shuttle's giant strap-on fuel tank with a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen rocket fuel.</p>
<p>U.S. Air Force meteorologists offered an improved weather forecast, giving the shuttle a one-in-three chance of getting off the launch pad on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The best weather was expected at the opening of the shuttle's two and 1/2 hour launch window.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is the earlier we go in the day the better,&quot; launch weather officer Scott Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Apart from weather concerns, the shuttle's three-day countdown had been trouble-free and engineers reported no unexpected technical problems.</p>
<p>Columbia and its crew of seven were to make a second attempt at a 16-day research mission that was cut short in April after just five days because of a troublesome power generator.</p>
<p>The shuttle was returned to the launch pad in near-record time for the rerun of the mission, but NASA managers insisted safety was not compromised.</p>
