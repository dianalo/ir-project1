<p>Investigations into bribery and match-fixing allegations in Portugal and Belgium could soon be complete, UEFA secretary general Gerhard Aigner said on Friday.</p>
<p>A special UEFA committee has been poring over reports and conducting interviews for the last six weeks.</p>
<p>The investigating committee might be prepared to submit a report to the executive committee at its next meeting on April 18 and announce its findings soon afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;I know the group has been working very hard, talking and seeing people,&quot; said Aigner. &quot;I can't tell you anymore because I am not involved but I can say we are interested in getting to a conclusion quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>UEFA media director Frits Alstrom confirmed the inquiry was close to wrapping up, &quot;perhaps as early as Easter&quot;.</p>
<p>The focus of the investigations in Belgium is Anderlecht's 1984 UEFA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>A Belgian has been charged with blackmail after he claimed the club had arranged for him to bribe the referee and subsequently paid him to keep quiet about it.</p>
<p>Anderlecht lost the first leg 2-0 but won the home second leg 3-0.</p>
<p>The Belgian has since claimed the club asked him to bribe another referee in a match earlier in the same UEFA Cup campaign.</p>
<p>Belgian media reported this week that an Anderlecht official gave evidence to the UEFA inquiry.</p>
<p>The head of Portugal's referees association resigned in November amid a series of match-fixing allegations that rocked the country's soccer officials.</p>
<p>One club chairman and a referee were jailed on bribery charges and Portuguse justice minister Joise Vera Jardim has said there as many as 10 soccer corruption cases pending.</p>
