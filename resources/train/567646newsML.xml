<p>Fresh off his bold decision to give the Bank of England greater independence, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown will get to face a much tougher subject next week -- Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>Expectations are high in Brussels that when Brown meets EU finance ministers for the first time on Monday he will carry on where his predecessor, Kenneth Clarke, left off -- constructive engagement which puts British interests first.</p>
<p>&quot;I must say it is no secret that Kenneth Clarke has been extremely constructive in the work of EU finance ministers,&quot; said one senior EU official.</p>
<p>&quot;Since there are no marked differences of position of the British parties on the single currency, we expect that this constructive attitude will continue.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke, who is now running for the leadership of the Conservative party, has long been respected in EU circles for his measured and positive approach towards economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>His successor is also judged to have got off to a stellar start by offering Britain's central bank free rein in setting interest rates. But on the single currency, officials say there is less opportunity for such bold strokes given the constraints of the government's policy.</p>
<p>In negotiations with its EU partners in 1992, Britain secured an opt-out to the single currency, preferring instead a wait-and-see policy that would allow it to judge the benefits of membership.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Labour's position will be pretty much the same as that of the Tories,&quot; said another EU diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a matter of analysing the benefits on their economic merits.&quot;</p>
<p>An abrupt reversal of this policy stance is not even contemplated. Brown himself said it was unlikely for Britain to join EMU in 1999, its planned start date.</p>
<p>Indeed, a decision to join on schedule would involve an almost monumental struggle, not the least of which is convincing a hostile British public that euro membership would be beneficial.</p>
<p>Labour has promised a public referendum ahead of any decision to join the single currency. Moreover, given the opt-out, the current government would have to publicly declare its intention to join before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Failure to do so would almost automatically rule out its membership in 1999.</p>
<p>Equally important, EU officials say any desire to participate in EMU would involve re-joining Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism -- another Maastricht treaty requirement.</p>
<p>Given Britain's ignomonious exit from the ERM in September 1992, such an option is not even on the table.</p>
<p>A more likely scenario would be for Britain to join the euro bloc before the introduction of banknotes and coins in 2002.</p>
<p>Apart from the intense media attention that is likely to accompany Brown's visit to Brussels, EU ministers will review the budget policies of all 15 EU nations.</p>
<p>Under the so-called excessive deficits procedure, the group is likely to endorse recent efforts made by Finland and the Netherlands in curbing public expenditure.</p>
<p>The two countries will then join Ireland, Luxembourg and Denmark in having met the deficit and debt criteria for monetary union.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be an examination of the economic convergence programmes of Spain and Portugal. Both countries are struggling to meet the preconditions of EMU.</p>
<p>Among the two, analysts say Portugal may stand the best chance for early membership.</p>
