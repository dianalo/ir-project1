<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A stronger Swiss franc helped to support the short end of the Swiss debt market, despite nervousness tied to U.S. data.</p>
<p>Dec Confederate bond futures ended firm but off highs after U.S. gross domestic product and home sales data.</p>
<p>U.S. single-family home sales fell 0.5 percent in September to an annual rate of 816,000 units, higher than the 768,000 forecast. The U.S. advance gross domestic product rose of 2.2 percent in the third quarter, above the 1.8 percent forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is relatively nervous after the numbers,&quot; one Swiss trader said. The market also awaits U.S. jobs data.  </p>
<p>The strong Swiss franc helped the short end of the market.</p>
<p>The franc remained steady even after the Bank of England raised the minimum lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>Tension over planned European currency union kept the Swiss franc trading firm after recent declines and took some upward pressure off of Swiss money rates. On Tuesday six leading German economic institutes told the German government it would fail to meet criteria for joining European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) next year, the reference year for countries hoping to join at the 1999 start-up date.  </p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Raimut Jochimsen also criticised France for fudging its budgetary bookkeeping in order to meet EMU standards.</p>
<p>A 125 million Swiss franc issue for Cayman Island-domiciled investment firm Sigma met with moderate success.</p>
<p>The 3-1/4 percent deal, priced at 105.15, was quoted in afternoon trade at minus 1.80 minus 2.00 on the issue to yield 3.17 percent.</p>
<p>One trader said the bond, though triple A rated, suffered somewhat from lack of investor recognition.  </p>
