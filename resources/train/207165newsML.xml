<p>Burundi's prime minister said on Thursday that France recognised his country's leaders, who seized power in a July coup, as the central African state's &quot;de facto government&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Burundian government is there, it is the de facto government...we think that the French government has recognised it and this is a good thing for peace in the world,&quot; Pascal Firmin Ndimira told a news conference during a visit to Paris.</p>
<p>Ndimira said his visit was intended to explain to Paris the transitional government's strategy for national reconciliation. France had shunned an earlier Burundian official visit.</p>
<p>He said he had made progress in relations, citing talks with French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain and aides to President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry declined comment on Ndimira's remarks, saying its ties with Burundi were unchanged since French policy was to recognise only states and not governments.</p>
<p>But France's decision to allow officials to meet Ndimira was in itself a breakthrough.</p>
<p>When Burundian Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama came to Paris in August, the French Foreign Ministry dubbed it a private visit and ruled out official talks.</p>
<p>Following the coup, Burundi's neighbours imposed an economic embargo on the African state and the European Parliament urged European Union member states to refuse to recognise Major Pierre Buyoya's new regime.</p>
<p>In a non-binding resolution approved in September, the European Parliament urged an extension of the ban on weapons and ammunition to put further pressure on the Burundi leadership to restore democracy.</p>
<p>Ndimira said his government had set in place a transitional &quot;document&quot; intended to guide the country's return to democracy and was making progress in healing national divisions.</p>
<p>He said the government also welcomed the recent return of 30,000 Burundian refugees from eastern Zaire and denied charges of mistreatment levelled by the human rights group Amnesty International.</p>
<p>&quot;The Burundi government is doing all it can to assist them, and has done its best to make them feel welcome upon their return,&quot; Ndimira told reporters.</p>
<p>Amnesty International, in a report released in London on Thursday, said the returning refugees were &quot;being forced back to Burundi to face the same terrible human rights abuses that caused them to flee in the first place&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;No refugees should be forcibly returned to a country which has seen as many as 500 returnees reportedly killed by the Burundi security forces in recent weeks,&quot; the group said, stating it had documented cases of killings, disappearances and ill-treatment occurring almost daily throughout the country.</p>
<p>Burundian Hutu refugees fled Burundi two years ago to escape the violence following the massacre of up to a million Tutsis in neighbouring Rwanda.</p>
<p>Ndimira said Burundi's refugee problem was far smaller than in Rwanda, which has been flooded by the return of hundreds of thousands of its people fleeing eastern Zaire to avoid fighting between Zairean forces and Tutsi rebels.</p>
<p>He estimated that Burundi had no more than 120,000 refugees remaining in eastern Zaire and urged them to all return home.</p>
