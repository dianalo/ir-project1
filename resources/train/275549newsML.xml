<p> TIFFE Euroyen 3M (U)     99.30		   99.30</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The key September Euroyen futures contract ended Tuesday's TIFFE day session flat after moving in a narrow range. Volume was light at 24,542 contracts.</p>
<p>September hit an intraday low of 99.29 in sympathy with a drop in Japanese government bond (JGB) futures, which was triggered by the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) decision to reduce the amount of outright bond purchases in this morning's operation, traders said.  </p>
<p>JGBs fell after the BOJ announced that it was offering to buy only 100 billion yen worth of bonds, compared with the usual 200 billion yen, traders said.</p>
<p>A BOJ official said the bank reduced the amount of its outright bond purchases due to an easing of the year-end fund shortage and a slowdown in bank note growth.</p>
<p>The key March JGB futures contract closed down 0.42 at 125.60, after falling as low as 125.49.</p>
<p>In the Euroyen futures market, there was some selling related to interest rate swap (IRS) payments in the three- to four-year sector, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Euroyen futures weakened at one point after the JGBs' fall. However, the Nikkei 225 average's afternoon nosedive led people to realise that Japan is in no condition for an interest rate hike. Hence, it is difficult for players to take short positions,&quot; said a city bank trader.</p>
<p>Traders said some position-adjustment selling is likely in the coming days but the September contract looks well-supported around 99.25.</p>
<p>In the interbank money market, key unsecured overnight call money was traded at 0.49 percent, up from 0.48 percent on Friday.  </p>
<p>Tokyo markets were closed for a holiday on Monday.</p>
<p>The BOJ injected a net 200 billion yen into the money market in the morning, maintaining a neutral stance.</p>
<p>One-, two- and three-month certificates of deposit (CDs) were offered at 0.51 percent, unchanged from Friday.</p>
