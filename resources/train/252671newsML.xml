<p>New car sales in Western Europe fell by 5.2 percent in November from the year before, ending several months of growth, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Passenger car registrations fell to 903,300 last month in the 15-member European Union, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, compared with 952,400 in November 1995.</p>
<p>By contrast, sales jumped 14.6 percent in October and 12.2 percent in September against figures for a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales from January to November rose 6.4 percent from the same period in 1995, ACEA said in a statement.</p>
<p>James Rosenstein, ACEA communications director, said some of the growth in recent months had been artificial and the November figure more accurately reflected Europe's slow economic growth, high unemployment and high taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;The economic fundamentals are not very positive in Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>November registrations plummeted by 21.8 percent in France after a state incentives scheme ended. They fell 5.5 percent in Britain, 0.8 percent in Germany and 11.4 percent in Italy, where sales had soared by 22.9 percent in October.</p>
<p>Rosenstein said Italy's October rise was high mainly because sales the previous year had been unusually low due to a big truckers strike.</p>
<p>Major European carmakers all saw their sales fall, but Japanese sales rose 2.8 percent to 93,713, giving them a 10.4 percent share of the market.</p>
<p>The Volkswagen group maintained its mumber one position in West European car sales, with a 17.9 percent market share in November. But its registrations fell by 0.5 percent to 162,000.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based General Motors group was in second place with a market share of 12.2 percent, but sales fell 7.7 percent to 110,491.</p>
<p>Sales fell at France's PSA, which groups Peugeot and Citroen, by 13.2 percent to 100,942. Renault sales fell 7.5 percent to 87,786, for a 9.7 percent share of the market.</p>
<p>Ford group sales dropped 6.9 percent to 98,921. They also fell at Italy's Fiat group by 9.5 percent to 106,500.</p>
