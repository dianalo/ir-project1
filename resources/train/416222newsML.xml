<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah stable in late trading.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah stable in late trading.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-03-03</dateline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in slow late trading on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading was dull on lack of fresh leads.</p>
<p>They said some players were trying to drive up the market in the morning with suggestions that the central bank's intervention may be widened, but apparently had failed.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no momentum in the market. Trading is driven by liquidity conditions,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said the tone was biddish on dollars due to ample rupiah supply, but worry of tighter liquidity this month on higher tax payments due to the fiscal year-end capped the upside.  </p>
<p>Dealers said operators wanted to play safe and remain conservative as the March 31 fiscal year-end approached.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said he expected tax payments to pick up in the middle of the month. Another factor operators focused on was the upcoming new reserve requirement rate effective on April 16.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,396.75/97.00 at 0900 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,3997.25/98.00. Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,396.60/96.90 and 2,396.40/96.80, respectively.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were not clear why overnight dollars were slightly tight on Monday.  </p>
<p>Overnight dollar was last at 5.875 rupiah against the usual rate of 5.25 percent. Some said it was taken at six percent.</p>
<p>Overnight rupiah was at 5.5 percent in the afternoon. The central bank did not offer overnight bilateral papers (SBIs).</p>
<p>Some attributed the central bank policy to its attempts to curb sustained strong capital inflows.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 9.75/10.25, two at 21.25/22.75, three at 33.5/34.5 and six at 71.75/73.00 points.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia raised its intervention band by one point to 2,383/2,575 and the conversion band to 2,383/2,431 on Monday after depreciating the rupiah two points last week.</p>
