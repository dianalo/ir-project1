<title>COLOMBIA: Prison warned of Colombian drug lord's escape plot.</title>

<p>Prison authorities cancelled Colombian cocaine king Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela's hospital check-up this weekend after receiving a tip he was planning to escape, national TV reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The NTC news programme said a letter had been sent to the chief prosecutor's office, warning of the break-out bid being plotted by the jailed No. 2 leader of the once-mighty Cali drug cartel and some of his former henchmen who are still on the run from justice.</p>
<p>A spokesman at the prosecutor's office on Sunday was unable to confirm whether a letter had been received and if it had been forwarded to the National Prisons Institute (INPEC).</p>
<p>Miguel Rodriguez, like his imprisoned brother Gilberto, the former cartel chieftain, suffers from heart problems and undergoes regular examinations at one of Bogota's top hospitals. The latest hospital visit had been scheduled for Saturday, NTC said.</p>
<p>The brothers were sentenced to jail terms 10 days ago that will in practice see them walk free in five years.</p>
<p>An anonoymous judge slashed potential maximum sentences of 24 years after the drug lords admitted their role in heading a vast criminal empire, whose tentacles stretched across the globe, for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>The terms caused uproar in Colombia and the United States.</p>
<p>The chief prosecutor's office has appealed the sentences and evidence is emerging that the brothers admitted only a small part of their total criminal enterprise -- which could lead to a fresh trial and stiffer sentences for the undeclared crimes.</p>
