<p>The Singapore government unveiled a series of measures on Saturday designed to cut the availability of subsidised housing loans for property purchases in the public sector.</p>
<p>The moves end subsidised housing loans for those with incomes over Singapore $8,000 ($5,555) per month, and limit the number of subsidised housing loans for all home buyers.</p>
<p>Around 86 percent of Singaporeans live in flats built by the government, and about 90 percent of these flats are owned by the people who live in them.</p>
<p>The new measures also include new credit assessment criteria to bring the provision of public housing loans more into line with the practices of the private sector market.</p>
<p>&quot;These are preventative measures to ensure Singaporeans do not buy flats beyond their means,&quot; a spokesman for the Ministry of National Development said in a written statement in answer to questions from Reuters.</p>
<p>In Singapore, public housing is provided by the Housing Development Board (HDB) and Singaporeans can use savings held with the government's compulsory retirement savings scheme, or Central Provident Fund (CPF), to help buy flats.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to encourage HDB flatowners to sell their existing flats, get a big loan to buy another flat and be indebted in their old age,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>At present, public housing owners pay mortgage interest rates at substantially lower levels than commercial rates, which are around six percent.</p>
<p>Under the new measures, home buyers are limited to just two government subsidised housing loans in a lifetime.</p>
<p>&quot;The two loans allow buyers to pay for their first flat and upgrade to the second. Applicants can continue to move to a third flat, but they will have to pay market interest rates on the third mortgage loan,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The government spokesman said the new measures were not expected to affect the selling prices of new flats in the public sector.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be some downward pressure on the resale flat prices with the new measaures. However, the impact is difficult to assess at this moment,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>On Friday, Singapore property stocks plunged sharply on rumours about the government's planned changes to the public housing market.</p>
<p>Analysts say any changes to the public housing market would have an impact on the private housing sector because the two were linked. (US$ = 1.44)</p>
