<title>RUSSIA: Russian parliament renews attack on Yeltsin health.</title>
<headline>Russian parliament renews attack on Yeltsin health.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-01-15</dateline>

<p>The communist chairman of Russia's lower house of parliament accused President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday of causing a profound social crisis because of his poor health.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing a systemic crisis in the state, which is manifested in a crisis of authority,&quot; Gennady Seleznyov told the State Duma in a short address opening the new session following the New Year recess.</p>
<p>&quot;It is mainly because the functioning of the institution of the presidency has got out of line,&quot; he said, stepping up attacks on Yeltsin in the opposition-dominated parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Constitutional power has been concentrated in it and the president finds himself in a position of being unable to exercise it...We deputies cannot ignore the public's worry.&quot;</p>
<p>Seleznyov, however, made no comment on a motion put forward on Tuesday by fellow communist Viktor Ilyukhin that the Duma should look into forcing Yeltsin to step down on health grounds.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old president is in hospital with pneumonia. Due to heart trouble and a coronary bypass operation, he has spent just a few days at work since being reelected on July 3.</p>
<p>Despite his attack, Seleznyov wished Yeltsin a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said on Tuesday evening that his condition was improving. Officials said on Wednesday morning that they would have no further comment until the afternoon.</p>
<p>Seleznyov, whose speech on Wednesday prompted angry rebukes from several liberal lawmakers, said on Tuesday that the motion to remove the president had no chance of success, partly due to the vagueness of the constitution.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers hope Ilyukhin's motion, which will be studied by the Duma's legal department this week, may at least help clarify the legal basis for an ailing leader stepping down.</p>
<p>The communists have long criticised the concentration of power in the president's hands under the 1993 constitution drawn up under Yeltsin and approved in a referendum.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's recent incapacity has prompted some calls even among his supporters for parliament to be given greater authority. Some liberals fear that Yeltsin's successor could be a hardline communist or nationalist and that it would be better to dilute the presidential mandate now.</p>
