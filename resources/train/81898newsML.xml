<p>Afghanistan's Taleban Islamic militia entered Kabul in tanks and on foot overnight on Friday, meeting little resistance from government forces which had abandoned the city hours before, witnesses said.</p>
<p>There was no fighting in Kabul.</p>
<p>Celebratory bursts of machine-gun fire and occasional explosions echoed across the city at dawn but the Afghan capital was relatively calm as Taleban fighters set up checkpoints to search vehicles, the witnesses said.</p>
<p>All key government installations appeared to be in Taleban hands including the Presidential Palace and the Ministries of Defence, Security and Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>No government forces were visible on the city's streets.</p>
<p>Troops had been seen leaving the city some hours before, on the only government-controlled road out of Kabul.</p>
<p>Witnesses said tanks, artillery and trucks loaded with soldiers headed north, apparently towards Jabal us-Sharaj, the headquarters of military chief Ahmad Shah Masood at the entrance to the Panjshir valley.</p>
<p>The fate of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, his military chief Ahmad Shah Masood, and Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was not immediately known.</p>
<p>Deputy foreign minister Adbul Rahim Ghafoorzai told Reuters Television at the United Nations late on Thursday government troops were leaving Kabul to avoid a &quot;bloodbath&quot;, and that Rabbani was considering handing over power.</p>
<p>&quot;Masood has decided to retreat to territory north of the city because he didn't want Kabul city to turn into a bloodbath,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;The president is in the outskirts to the north and by tomorrow (Friday) will announce his decision whether to leave the capital,&quot; he said adding that the president would take the advice of other members of his high council.</p>
<p>He said he thought &quot;there will be a transfer of power, to whom we do not know.&quot;</p>
<p>He hoped that Afghanistan's former King, Zahir Shah, ousted in 1973 and now in Rome, would return to the country as even the Taleban would accept him in a leadership role.</p>
<p>Kabul itself was quiet on Friday.  Civilians were walking in the streets in the morning past Taleban fighters manning checkpoints and crossroads.</p>
<p>Some people were returning to their homes in the eastern suburbs laden with belongings after fleeing earlier fighting.</p>
<p>Taleban forces entered the city from the west, east and south at about 1.00 a.m. (2130 GMT Thursday).</p>
<p>They stopped in one street in the diplomatic Wazir Akbar Kahan Li neighbourhood and set up a loudspeaker and recited from the Koran for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The Taleban captured Kabul after a two day offensive in which hundreds of people were killed on both sides, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>The Taleban advance began after the Islamic rebels took the town of Sarobi, 70 km (44 miles) east of the capital on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Masood spokesman Amrullah told reporters on Thursday in Kabul that government forces would fight to the death to defend the capital but added: &quot;If Kabul were to fall tomorrow it would not mean resistance would be over&quot;.</p>
