<p>Spanish truckers went back to work on Thursday after a two-week strike that caused billions of pesetas of losses but was seen as a victory for the young conservative government in its first big labour conflict.</p>
<p>The truckers called off the strike late on Wednesday after the government met some, but not all, of their demands.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no deal, but strictly from a sense of responsibility it has been decided not to continue (with the strike),&quot; the truckers said in a statement early on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a renouncing of any of the truckers' claims, which we will continue defending.&quot;</p>
<p>The transporters got promises for a cut in diesel prices and a long overdue restructuring of the entire transport sector, but a key demand for early retirement at age 60 was not met.</p>
<p>Analysts said the protracted work stoppage would hit February's Spanish industrial production index and unemployment figures.</p>
<p>It clogged roads, ports and border crossings last week, causing severe food shortages and halting car production and other manufacturing at plants in Spain, Portugal and Germany.</p>
<p>But there was general agreement that the nine-month-old conservative government had ridden out the crisis, in which police escorts were needed to get supplies past angry pickets and idle trucks lining Spain's highways, in good form.</p>
<p>&quot;The government handled it well, holding out against the violent attacks and giving some consessions,&quot; economist Valentin Fernandez of Credit Lyonais said. &quot;If they had ceded everything it could have set a dangerous precedent.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspaper El Mundo, which backed the conservative Popular Party government ahead of last year's election, praised the administration's response to the strike but said it desperately needed to overhaul the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The victory could be pyrrhic if an immediate restructuring of the road transport sector is not put into action after being put off shamelessly since 1986,&quot; El Mundo said.</p>
<p>Labour Minister Javier Arenas said he was happy the strike was over but he was worried about how it had damaged the economy.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 people had to be laid off because of the strike, which hit industry and agriculture particularly hard causing losses estimated in the billions of pesetas.</p>
<p>Nearly all of Spain's car production plants had to be shut down at some point including Renault, PSA Peugeot-Citroen, SEAT, Nissan, Santana, Opel, Ford, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>&quot;In some cases it could be called a strike, in other cases it could be called public altercations that have been negative for our economy and negative for employment,&quot; Arenas said.</p>
<p>The government had accused some of the more radical protesters of having links to Basque separatist rebels and acting violently more to create public disturbance than to get labour concessions.</p>
<p>In the northern regions, pickets firebombed trucks and attacked drivers and buses.</p>
<p>The Basque business association Confebask said the region had suffered from a drop in exports and cancelled contracts due to the &quot;forced inactivity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It regrettably caused multi-millions of losses and will have big consequences for the future of our companies,&quot; Confebask said in a statement.</p>
