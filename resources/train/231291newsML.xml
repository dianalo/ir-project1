<title>USA: Judge legalizes gay marriages in Hawaii.</title>
<headline>Judge legalizes gay marriages in Hawaii.</headline>
<dateline>HONOLULU 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>A judge in Hawaii ruled Tuesday that same-sex marriages are legal, making the state the first in America to recognize that gay and lesbian couples are entitled to the same privileges as heterosexual married couples.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Judge Kevin Chang found that the Hawaiian state government had failed to establish a &quot;compelling state interest&quot; to justify the prohibition against same-sex marriages, said Dan Foley, a lawyer for three same-sex couples who sued the state in a landmark case.  </p>
<p>Foley, who was jubilant after his meeting with Hawaii Circuit Court Judge Chang to learn of his ruling, told reporters, &quot;I couldn't have gotten more, we got 100 percent.&quot; Hawaii's Deputy Attorney General, Rick Eichor, declined comment.</p>
<p>Foley first filed his suit in 1990 on behalf of three same-sex couples and in 1993 the Hawaiian Supreme Court ordered attorneys for the state to show &quot;compelling&quot; reasons why state discrimination against gay marriages was justified.</p>
<p>The case was responsible for legislative moves at national and state level to bar recognition of legalized gay marriages in order to save states not sanctioning such unions from having to pay benefits afforded to heterosexual married couples.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, President Clinton signed into law the &quot;Defense of Marriage&quot; act, prohibiting federal agencies from giving spouses in same-sex marriages the same benefits as those received by heterosexual couples.</p>
