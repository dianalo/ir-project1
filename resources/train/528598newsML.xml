<title>BELGIUM: Denmark critical of use of structural fund aid.</title>
<headline>Denmark critical of use of structural fund aid.</headline>

<p>Denmark is questioning the use of the European Union's regional funds for direct support to businesses, saying it risks creating jobs in receiving regions only at the expense of employment in other member states.</p>
<p>Copenhagen, traditionally critical of state handouts, will raise the issue at a meeting of EU industry ministers in Luxembourg on Thursday.</p>
<p>EU structural funds, worth some 35 billion European currency units ($40 billion) a year, are a mix of grants to help poorer regions catch up with their healthier neighbours.</p>
<p>In a note submitted to Thursday's meeting, Denmark said the funds were designed to strengthen economic development in weaker regions without damaging opportunities for growth elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is therefore whether it is appropriate to give direct support to businesses via the structural funds -- particularly in prosperous EU countries -- which could have the effect of distorting competition,&quot; it said. &quot;Should not the general (EU) treaty rules on state aid and competition be applied instead?&quot;</p>
<p>Denmark said other EU countries had also seen production and jobs move to regions in other member states in order to benefit from regional state aid or structural fund support.</p>
<p>&quot;In such cases there is no question of new undertakings or jobs being created by but simply of jobs being moved within an otherwise unchanged industrial structure,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Danish initiative is seen as a reaction to two recent cases where the loss of jobs in Denmark may have been caused by structural fund support to firms in other EU regions.</p>
<p>Recently, Boston Scientific Corp, a high-growth U.S. medical equipment specialist, decided to close its operations in Denmark and Belgium to expand in Galway, western Ireland.</p>
<p>In view of this development, Denmark calls for greater attention to be paid to the effects of structural policy and regional state aid on competitive conditions in the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim being to determine how the structural policy can best assist the least favoured areas without this resulting in plant closures in other parts of the Community,&quot; the note said.</p>
<p>EU officials say some countries, such as Belgium, share the Danish concerns, but that other member states insist that the discussion should not only focus on the structural funds.</p>
<p>French car maker Renault's decision to close its Vilvoorde plant in Belgium sparked a heated debate on the issue last month.</p>
<p>Renault decided to close a plant in Belgium, with the loss of 3,100 jobs, and increase production in the Spanish northern province of Castille-Leon. The province is eligible for EU and Spanish funds as one of the EU's poorest.</p>
<p>Without naming the firm, EU Regional Affairs Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies reacted sharply in a statement last month.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither present competition rules, nor the structural fund regulations, can sufficiently prevent companies from abusing the system by moving their activities in such a way as to maximise the aid they receive from public sources,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Wulf-Mathies, who is in charge of EU structural funds, warned that this could &quot;no longer be tolerated&quot; and that she had the &quot;firm intention&quot; to prevent such behaviour in the near future.</p>
