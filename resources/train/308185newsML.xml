<headline>RUGBY LEAGUE - Strong sales for first Warriors game.</headline>
<text>
<p>AUCKLAND, Jan 16 - The Auckland Warriors will have plenty of support for their first pre-season Super League match against the North Queensland Cowboys in Invercargill, NZPA reports.</p>
<p>Southland Rugby Union chief executive John Brookland said ticket sales had been strong for the Saturday, January 25, game.</p>
<p>&quot;And as far as Southland Rugby is concerned, we're pleased to see such top-level sport come to Southland and Invercargill and the response so far justifies their decision to play the match here,&quot; Brookland said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are also additional factors like having Matthew Ridge lead the side for the first time and that it might well be the first Super League match in Australasia.&quot;</p>
<p>It is understood around 12,000 tickets have been sold for the ground, which has a capacity just over 16,000.</p>
<p>The Warriors' other pre-season matches are against the Adelaide Rams in Tonga on February 6 and the Western Reds in Wanganui on February 16.</p>
