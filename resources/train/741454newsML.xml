<p>Like a reformed alcoholic, only total abstinence will cure Brazil from the hyperinflation of the past, Central Bank Director of Monetary Policy Francisco &quot;Chico&quot; Lopes said in an interview published Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;In Brazil, if we had inflation of 50 or 60 percent, we would sink straight back into hyperinflation,&quot; Lopes told Globo newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a social catastrophe. We are like former alcoholics and only total abstinence will cure us,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The Brazilian government's &quot;Plano Real&quot; economic stability plan has successfully brought inflation down from a peak of almost 5,000 percent a year three years ago to about 10 percent last year.</p>
<p>As he and other officials have done all week, Lopes ruled out any change in foreign exchange or monetary policy in the wake of currency devaluations in Asia.</p>
<p>Market jitters over a possible domino effect, forcing a Brazilian devaluation, pounded stocks in Sao Paulo and across the region this week, shaving more than 10 percent off the Bovespa stock index.  </p>
<p>But Lopes said Brazil was completely committed to stability and the fight against inflation, and would stick to its forex and monetary policies until full stability was assured.</p>
<p>&quot;During this transition, which could take years, we will have the vulnerability of a wide current account deficit and dependency on external financing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lopes criticized Thailand, the first of the so-called &quot;Asian Tigers&quot; to succumb to currency speculators, for allowing its currency to devaluate.  </p>
<p>&quot;Thailand will pay dearly for this. Thailand is trying to do something impossible: remain an Asian Tiger when it no longer is.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopes also insisted that Brazil was committed to controlling public spending because &quot;if we lose discipline in our economic policy, we make ourselves vulnerable to attack,&quot; he said.</p>
