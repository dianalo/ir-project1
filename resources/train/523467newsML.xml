<headline>EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS -  WSC - 21-APR.</headline>
<text>
<p>Severe flooding continues in the US Northern Plains and upper Midwest from the eastern Dakotas into western Minnesota, also in southern Manitoba, Canada. Many rivers, especially the Red River near Fargo and Grand Forks, North Dakota, have continued to rise over the past few days and are at all-time record levels. Although no major storminess is expected during the next several days, this flooding situation is going to be very slow to diminish.  </p>
<p>Typhoon Isa, with 110 mph winds, is southeast of Japan in the western Pacific near 22.1n/138.8e, moving north-northeast at 15 mph. A turn more to the northeast is expected during the next day or two as the storm weakens.  It is expected to pass well to the southeast of Japan, out to sea, with time, but remains a major threat to any shipping in the region for the next 48 hours.  </p>
<p>There are no other emergency statements at this time.</p>
