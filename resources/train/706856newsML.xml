<p>Repairs began on the Estoril racing track on Friday, paving the way for a possible staging of the Portuguese Formula One Grand Prix later this year.</p>
<p>The repairs began after the government agreed to take control of the circuit by forming a new company jointly with a private company Grao-Para. The state holds a majority 51 percent stake and Grao-Para the remaining 49 percent.</p>
<p>The repairs have to be finished by August 31 before the International Automobile Federation (FIA) takes a decision on whether to stage the Portuguese Grand Prix this year.</p>
<p>FIA announced in May that the October 26 race would be switched to Jerez, Spain, because of doubts that repairs needed on the twisting Estoril circuit would be completed on time.</p>
<p>But FIA subsequently said the Portuguese Grand Prix might still be held at the Estoril circuit before the end of the year providing all the Formula One teams gave their consent.</p>
<p>If it does take place, it would mean an extension of the season and the addition of an 18th Grand Prix to the 1997 world championship.</p>
