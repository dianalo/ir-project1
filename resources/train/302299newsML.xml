<headline>CHINA, TAIWAN TAKE DIPLOMATIC WAR TO AFRICA.</headline>

<p>China and Taiwan took their diplomatic war to Africa on Monday, with senior officials of the two countries canvassing for friends in two separate corners of the continent.</p>
<p>While Beijing's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met government leaders in the impoverished Sahelian state of Niger, his Taipei counterpart, John Chang, began his own regional sweep in southern Africa.</p>
<p>Qian arrived in Niger on Sunday for a 48-hour visit and talks with President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara before going on to Mauritania, Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe.</p>
<p>Chang, who arrived in Pretoria the same day, travels to Malawi, Swaziland, Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, Gambia and Senegal. He returns to Taipei on February 2.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very apparent that the diplomatic war across the Taiwan Strait is now in the ascendant in Africa,&quot; Taiwan's state-run Central News Agency said as Chang left.</p>
<p>Aid-hungry Africa has been a central battlefield for the decades-old diplomatic war between Taiwan and China -- political rivals since a civil war separated them in 1949.</p>
<p>China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and has pursued a relentless campaign to isolate Taipei internationally.</p>
<p>While Taiwan struggles to win foreign ties with its strong economic muscle, China uses financial aid plus its diplomatic clout as a permanent member of the Security Council, to lure poor states.</p>
<p>Both are uncompromising on the question of recognition, breaking ties and instantly cutting off aid to any African state that establishes diplomatice relations with the other.</p>
<p>In a bizarre example of pragmatic diplomacy, Niger recently switched allegiances back and forth between Taipei and Beijing, with the two Chinese states having to up the aid ante each time to remain competitive.</p>
<p>The competition between China and Taiwan has played into the hands of African states in search of a lifeline after being shunned by the West over democracy or human rights.</p>
<p>Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, has been warmly embraced by China since falling foul of traditional Western partners after the November 1995 execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight minority rights activists.</p>
<p>Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi visited China last year with a large delegation of businessmen. Information Minister Walter Ofonagoro followed to sign a cultural agreement.</p>
<p>China has since secured a contract worth more than $500 million for the rehabilitation of eastern Port Harcourt harbour facilities for the export of coal, as well as a railway deal.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that China's relations with Nigeria are at an unprecedented level,&quot; a Nigerian commentator said, adding that Nigeria would draw closer to China as long as the West wielded a threat of U.N. sanctions on Nigerian oil. Nigeria expects China to veto any oil sanctions resolution.</p>
<p>South Africa, the biggest of Taiwan's only 30 diplomatic allies, announced in late 1996 that it would switch recognition to Beijing from Taipei by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Despite Pretoria's decision, Taiwan has said it hopes to maintain the highest level of relations with South Africa after their formal diplomatic ties were severed. Its aid projects there would depend on the level of new relations.</p>
<p>Chang told reporters at Johannesburg airport that Taiwanese investors were jittery over South Africa's decision.</p>
<p>&quot;They became nervous about the future of investment,&quot; said Chang, speaking during a stop en route to Malawi. He returns on January 19 for talks with South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo to map out a future relationship.</p>
