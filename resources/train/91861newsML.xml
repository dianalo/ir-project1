<p>Italian bonds, rattled by recent bickering between France and Italy over European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), are set to benefit as the two countries strive to improve relations, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Franco-Italian summit starts on Thursday in Naples, when Italian prime minister Romano Prodi meets French president Jacques Chirac to discuss EMU.</p>
<p>It comes after a week which has seen Chirac cast doubt on Italy's EMU credentials and accusations from Italy of a plot to keep them out of the union.</p>
<p>&quot;It's kiss and make up time,&quot; said David Brown, chief international economist at Bear Stearns International in London. &quot;France is going to try to make up for its gaffs this week by being very public in its support for the lira going back into the ERM (exchange rate mechanism) and being part of EMU.&quot;</p>
<p>Chirac triggered a row on Tuesday by saying Italy might not be fit to join a single European currency from the proposed start date of 1999.</p>
<p>The French president, in the face of Italy's threats to cancel the summit, recovered by praising Italy's tight budget, adding that he hoped Italy would be among the front-runners.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market was keen to see Italy making clear progress towards EMU, with re-entry into ERM a priority, after the lira crashed out in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;A return to the ERM is worth five to 10 basis points off the BTP/Bund spread,&quot; said Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase in London. &quot;If Italy wants to be in EMU in 1999, it must be back in the ERM by the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The spread between the yields on 10-year Italian bonds (BTPs) and comparable German Bunds was 239 basis points (2.39 percentage points) by midsession.</p>
<p>Brown said he expected the spread to fall to 200 basis points over the next three to four months, although he said there was a chance it would make that move within the next four weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's got far more chance of going below 200 than of heading back to 300,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The BTP/Bund spread was above the key 300 basis point level in mid-September.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were also watching the summit for indications of what the lira's ERM central rate would be. Mark/lira currently trades around 995.25.</p>
<p>&quot;We're watching for the French to say the lira can't go back in until it's at 950.00 per mark,&quot; said Brown.</p>
<p>He said that rate was more helpful to France than to Italian domestic manufacturers and Italy should rejoin ERM as soon as possible before further currency strengthening.</p>
<p>Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW in London, said international investors were still keen on picking up BTPs.</p>
<p>She said the market was looking for an excuse to take the BTP/Bund spread lower over the next few months and ERM membership could be the trigger.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why Spain is doing better,&quot; said Reed. &quot;Its ERM membership helped to hold the currency.&quot;</p>
<p>Schmidt said the long end of the Italian yield curve offered the safest investment, and investors who were overweight in Bunds might start to consider switching into the high yielders.</p>
<p>Analysts said the summit might persuade investors that Italy's EMU membership was a more likely proposal than previously.</p>
