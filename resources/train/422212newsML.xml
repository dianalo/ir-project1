<p>Australian Employment Minister Amanda Vanstone said on Wednesday the number of foreigners wanting to study in Australia had surged, despite the recent damaging race debate.</p>
<p>Student visa applications from October to January, 1997, were 11 percent higher than the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Total spending by foreign students in Australia jumped 21 percent to A$2.8 billion in fiscal 1995/96 from A$2.3 billion in the year to June 30, 1995.  </p>
<p>Australia was wracked by a damaging race debate after independent parliamentarian Pauline Hanson warned in a September speech the country was being swamped by Asian immigrants.</p>
<p>The row sparked allegations of an increase in abuse against Asians in Australia and reports some foreign students were being victimised.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures indicate that our neighbours give no credibility to the so-called Hanson racism debate, a treatment which it fully deserves,&quot; Vanstone said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;International students are making a strong contribution to improving Australia's trade balance and play a very important role in the Australian economy,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>A study by the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research found last year that about 86 percent of Australia's 70,000 foreign students came from Asia.</p>
