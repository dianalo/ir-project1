<p>A Democratic senator warned the Clinton administration on Thursday that the Senate likely would reject a treaty to fight global warming that did not require developing countries to limit their heat-trapping pollution.</p>
<p>Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia said his resolution that calls on the administration to seek commitments from developing countries as well as from industrialised countres had 61 Senate signatures.</p>
<p>Appearing before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee, Byrd said failure to include developing countries in a treaty to reduce pollution that is warming the atmosphere would put &quot;a mountain&quot; in front of chances for Senate ratification.</p>
<p>The United States is negotiating a treaty with other industrialised nations to reduce pollution from burning fossil fuels that is causing a build-up of carbon in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If countries reach an agreement, the deal still would have to be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate.</p>
<p>Also testifying before the panel, Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth said it would be virtually impossible to get a treaty that requires developing countries to immediately start limiting their emissions when the United States and other industrialised countries are responsible for most of the carbon build-up.</p>
<p>Instead, he said, developing countries should be brought into the treaty as their economies grow under a subsequent negotiation that the United States is calling for.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't have this kind of evolutionary process, we're not going to get anywhere,&quot; Wirth told the subcommittee.</p>
<p>But Byrd said a deal that did not include developing countries such as China &quot;is inherently unsound and ineffectual on its face.&quot;</p>
<p>Byrd, whose coal-producing home state would be hit by limits on fossil fuel use, has become one of the main critics of the administration's efforts to get an international global warming deal.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that if the treaty we are negotiating today does not equally commit developing nations like China to binding commitments, there will be no incentive for China and other nations of the developing world to make responsible and environmentally sound choices as they develop, and there will be no incentive for the Senate to approve such a treaty,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After the hearing, Wirth told reporters he did not believe that Byrd's resolution was a &quot;poison pill&quot; for eventual Senate ratification of a treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;What this is saying is it is important to bring in developing countries....over a period of time, and the question is what is that schedule going to be,&quot; Wirth said.</p>
<p>Wirth also told reporters the United States could not agree to the European Union's call for industrialised nations to reduce emissions to 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010 because &quot;it's not feasible. We physically could not do a 15 percent reduction by the year 2010.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he hoped to have the plan for targets and timetables for emissions reductions U.S. negotiators will seek in the climate talks by late summer or fall, before the negotiation's final session in December.</p>
