<p>Children's Broadcasting Corp said Friday it had signed a letter of intent to sell its owned and operated AM radio stations to Global Broadcasting Co Inc for a total of $72.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Although it is CBC's present intention to continue its mission to create and distribute children's programming content responsive to today's kids and families, CBC has been forced to alter its operations because of ABC/Disney's method of entering the children's radio market,&quot; said Christopher Dahl, Children's Broadcasting president and chief executive officer.  </p>
<p>The CBC radio stations to be sold include: WJDM-AM 1660, New York; KPLS-AM 830, Los Angeles; WAUR-AM 930, Chicago; WPWA-AM 1590, Philadelphia; WCAR-AM 1090, Detroit; KAHZ-AM 1360, Dallas/Ft. Worth; WWTC-AM 1280 and KYCR-AM 1570, Minneapolis; KIDR-AM 740, Phoenix, Ariz.; KKYD-AM 1340, Denver; KMUS-AM 1380, Tulsa, Okla.; KTEK-AM 1110, Houston, and WZER-AM 540, Milwaukee.  </p>
<p>&quot;The sale of our AM properties will allow us to develop ancillary audio streams for (radio) programming and to continue to serve our existing network of radio station affiliates, while significantly reducing our costs of operations.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, the company will pursue to its conclusion the ABC/Disney litigation while exploring other options,&quot; Dahl said in a statement.</p>
<p>The proposed sale requires completion of a definitive purchase agreement, due diligence and approvals by shareholders and the Federal Communications Commission.  </p>
<p>In September, Children's Broadcasting filed suit alleging that Walt Disney Co's Disney/ABC was trying to &quot;missapropriate CBC's unique radio programming format and force Children's Broadcasting out of the children's radio market.&quot;</p>
<p>The wsuit alleges that ABC and Disney have used a relationship between CBC and ABC, since terminated, to obtain confidential business information about CBC that ABC and Disney used to develop and market a competing children's network.</p>
<p>Children's Broadcasting shares were up two points at 5-5/8 Friday afternoon.</p>
