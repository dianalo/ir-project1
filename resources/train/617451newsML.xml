<title>USA: Fed expected to add reserves via term system repos.</title>
<headline>Fed expected to add reserves via term system repos.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-27</dateline>

<p>The Federal Reserve is likely to add temporary reserves to the open market Tuesday via term system repurchase agreements to address a post-holiday-weekend reserve need, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The (open market operations) desk should be in with term system repos to address (pressure following a long weekend),&quot; said an analyst at MMS International.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking for two-day system repurchases,&quot; said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. &quot;But there's some uncertainty. They might go farther out and do a six-day.&quot;  </p>
<p>Moran said the Fed would be addressing a seasonal add need. As the summer vacation season begins, the public's currency holdings increase, draining reserves from the banking system. The Fed has to replace those reserves, he said.</p>
<p>With that add need growing in coming weeks, a permanent injection of reserves could come at any time during the period, via an outright purchase of bills or, less likely, a coupon pass, analysts said. The Fed has conducted a bill pass within two weeks after Memorial Day in six of the last seven years, though the add need this year is not so large as to make one certain, analysts said.  </p>
<p>At midmorning the federal funds rate stood at 5-9/16 percent, above the Fed's 5-1/2 percent target.</p>
