<p>U.S. telephone group WorldCom Inc is confident of winning a licence to operate fixed-line telecommunications in Singapore from 2000, the head of its international division said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Colin Williams, president of WorldCom International, said his company's focus on sophisticated data phone services, rather than voice transmission gave it an advantage.</p>
<p>WorldCom is bidding for a Singapore phone licence jointly with local industrial group SembCorp and state-owned railway Singapore MRT Ltd (SMRT).</p>
<p>&quot;We would view ourselves as the logical choice for the licence. The government is clearly looking for innovation and new services and far less emphasis on conventional telephony. That stands us in good stead,&quot; Williams said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;SembCorp is very strong in media and owns Pacific Internet, a leading Internet Service Provider, while SMRT is enormously attractive because it brings rights of way and an ability to construct at relatively low cost the sort of optical fibre leads that are needed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>They are competing with two other consortiums for the right to challenge the existing monopoly telephone company, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel), for phone customers.</p>
<p>The government is to award one or two licences next year for services to begin from April 2000.</p>
<p>The strongest bid on paper is from a group made up of British Telecomunications (BT), Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and two state firms, Singapore Technologies and Singapore Power.</p>
<p>The other bid is from the consortium that already runs Singapore's second mobile phone network, MobileOne (M1), made up of Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless, its unit HongKong Telecommunications Ltd, Keppel Telecom and Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>Analysts see the WorldCom group, which announced its intention to bid just one day before the deadline for initial submissions on May 31, as possibly the weakest of the three.</p>
<p>BT and NTT both have huge financial resources and through BT's new American partner, MCI, can offer access to global telephone services. M1 already has a foothold in the Singapore mobile phone market, liberalised on April 1.</p>
<p>Williams said WorldCom, which saw its first quarter 1997 revenues jump 62 percent year-on-year to US$1.68 billion, largely on the back of data services to corporate customers, was prepared to invest heavily in Singapore and the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The world is changing very rapidly and telecoms in the future will no longer be focused on voice traffic but on data,&quot; which were WorldCom's strength, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the global telecoms market today, it is about 80 percent voice and 20 percent data. But if you look five years hence, it is going to be a complete flip, reversed, with about 80 percent data -- much of it Internet -- and 20 percent voice,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Voice is growing by 15 to 20 percent in Southeast Asia, but data is growing by 50 to 100 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>He said WorldCom's experience in constructing new networks was also invaluable.</p>
<p>&quot;None of the other foreign competitors have anything like that reputation or experience in building fibre networks. We've built 60 in the last five years. Our network in London is almost exactly the size of Singapore,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Williams said WorldCom was committed to enhancing Singapore's role as an Asian telecoms hub.</p>
<p>&quot;Singapore is a natural hub and is very high on the priority list for our customers in the United States and Europe. It is probably the number one or number two country in this area for many of our customers.&quot;</p>
