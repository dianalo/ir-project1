<p>Mexican department store sales fell 6.7 percent in December compared with the same month in 1995 suggesting comsumption was still in the doldrums, the National Association of Department Stores (Antad) said.</p>
<p>It added that self-service store sales were off 3.7 percent in the same period, and offered little hope for a rebound in 1997.  </p>
<p>&quot;Compared with the rest of 1996, the month of December showed the sixth biggest fall in department store sales and was ninth in terms of self-service stores. This indicates there continues to be very strong resistance to a pick-up in domestic consumption,&quot; a statement said.</p>
<p>Over the year, department sales plummeted 9.4 percent, a sharp drop considered it compared with 1995, the year Mexico suffered its worst recession in 50 years. Clothing was off 6.5 percent, the &quot;various&quot; category fell 8.2 percent, and large appliances dropped 12.6 percent.  </p>
<p>Self-service store sales fell 8.6 percent in 1996 versus 1995, with supermarket sales off 7.85 percent, clothing off 14.3 percent and general merchandise down 8.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim for 1997 is to stop the decline, with expectations being for zero growth as an average over the year,&quot; Antad said. Long-term, it was barely more up-beat.</p>
<p>&quot;The sales levels of 1994 will not be recouped until after the year 2000,&quot; it said, referring to the year before the government devalued the peso and plunged the country into economic crisis.</p>
