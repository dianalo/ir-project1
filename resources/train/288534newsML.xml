<title>NEW ZEALAND: Brierley ringfences Air NZ 'A' shares.</title>
<headline>Brierley ringfences Air NZ 'A' shares.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-01-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brierley Investments Ltd, now classified as a foreign company, has ringfenced its Air New Zealand 'A' shares in a New Zealand company, group communications manager Mike Drogemuller said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Drogemuller played down the impact of the change, saying it was merely a housekeeping matter. He declined to comment on whether the move was aimed at avoiding an enforced sell-down of Brierley's stake.  </p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't comment on any speculation that we would be forced to sell our stake. It really is a matter of complying with the OIC (Overseas Investment Commission) requirements, and that's all it is. We have complied with what they want,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>BIL was removed from the second schedule of the OIC's exemption notice on December 20 last year, meaning it is officially a foreign company.  </p>
<p>Asian investors now own more than a quarter of Brierley Investments, with Malex Industries Bhd of Malaysia holding 20 percent and the Singapore government owning a further six percent.</p>
<p>Air New Zealand 'A' shares must remain under New Zealand control, while 'B' shares can be owned by anyone. The A and B share division was stipulated when Air New Zealand was privatised in 1989.</p>
<p>Brierley owns 55 percent of the Air New Zealand 'A' shares, and 30 percent of its 'B' shares.  </p>
<p>BIL's Air New Zealand 'A' shares have been tipped into BIL NZ Assets Ltd, which was set up in early December. BIL NZ Assets was added to the schedule when BIL was removed, despite it being effectively owned by Brierley Investments.</p>
<p>OIC assistant secretary Peter Hill said BIL NZ Assets had been structured so control of the company was ringfenced from Brierley Investments.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a ringfenced entity which met our parameters of still being New Zealand-controlled, notwithstanding that it is a...subsidiary of Brierleys,&quot; Hill told Reuters.  </p>
<p>He said BIL NZ Assets met the OIC's requirement that the directors were citizens and residents of New Zealand, and that 75 percent of the directors, including the chair, were independent of BIL.</p>
<p>Directors of BIL NZ Assets are Telecom chairman Peter Shirtcliffe, Wrightson chairman Sir Ron Trotter, Wellington QC Bill Wilson, and Brierley Investments and Air New Zealand chairman Bob Matthew.  </p>
<p>The OIC said its policy was to include on the second schedule to the Overseas Investment Exemption Notice 1995 companies which are more than 25 percent overseas-owned if they can establish control is clearly in New Zealand hands.</p>
<p>The OIC said it had concluded that it was inappropriate to continue listing BIL on the schedule.</p>
<p>Drogemuller said he could not comment on plans for Brierley's half share in fishing company Sealord and its stake in Tasman Agriculture, which may also be affected by the parent company's removal from the schedule.</p>
