<title>USA: Warner-Lambert shares surge on drug news.</title>
<headline>Warner-Lambert shares surge on drug news.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The stock of Warner-Lambert Co jumped Monday afternoon on a favorable report about its new diabetes drug and on data showing increased new prescription sales of its anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor.</p>
<p>Shares were up 4-1/16 to 139-3/16.</p>
<p>A report Monday in the Financial Times said &quot;powerful clincial evidence&quot; for the the effectiveness of diabetes drug troglitazone, marketed by Warner-Lambert as Rezulin in the United States since March, would be presented this week at a conference in Helsinki.  </p>
<p>Sankyo of Japan, which developed the drug, has licensed it to Glaxo Wellcome Plc for sales in Europe.</p>
<p>The report said Glaxo will present data showing the drug decreases the risk of kidney and heart disease, a leading cause of death in diabetes patients.</p>
<p>Glaxo's shares were up 1/8 to 44-1/2.</p>
<p>Data showing improved sales of Warner-Lambert's cholesterol fighting drug Lipitor also helped send its shares higher.  </p>
<p>Warner-Lambert spokesman Stephen Mock said the latest weekly  data from market researcher IMS International showed Lipitor increased its market share of all cholesterol lowering drugs to 20.9 percent from 20.7 percent during the week ending July 11. He said the data showed sales of Zocor, the leading anti-cholesterol drug sold by Merck &amp; Co, had slipped to 26.9 percent from 27.4 percent.</p>
<p>Merck's shares were off 1-7/8 to 104-1/2.</p>
<p>&quot;We're certainly pleased with the performance of Lipitor since we only released it 20 weeks ago,&quot; Mock said.</p>
<p>He said Warner-Lambert would detail full Lipitor sales results when the company releases its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert launched Lipitor in February. It is being co-marketed by Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>Pfizer's shares were down 1/2 to 58.</p>
