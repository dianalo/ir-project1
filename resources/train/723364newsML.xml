<text>
<p>A lieutenant in the internal affairs investigation department of the Los Angeles police pleaded not guilty Thursday to unlawfully having sex with a 17-year-old girl he met on the Internet.</p>
<p>Steve Twohy, 43, allegedly had intercourse with the girl, who lived with her mother, five times between November and February.</p>
<p>The relationship apparently began after they &quot;met&quot; in a computer &quot;chat room,&quot; prosecutors said.</p>
<p>At his arraignment, the 19-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, was granted bail of $10,000 and is on suspension pending the case. A preliminary hearing was set for Aug. 21.</p>
<p>His lawyer told reporters Twohy's defence would be that he believed the girl was over 18 years old.</p>
<p>Besides the unlawful sex charges, Twohy is also charged with illegal use of a police computer. He faces up to six years in prison if convicted.</p>
