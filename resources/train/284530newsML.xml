<title>GERMANY: German shares tread water in quiet IBIS DAX trade.</title>
<headline>German shares tread water in quiet IBIS DAX trade.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>German shares recover some lost ground in late electronic trade on Thursday, with the index down over one percent, but still boosted by the ongoing strength of the dollar and a firmer opening on Wall Street.</p>
<p>A 101-point fall in the Dow Jones index on the last session of the year had earlier pushed the market down to 2,829.12 points, but by 1436 GMT the index recovered somewhat to stand at 2,845.77 points, down 34.30.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the strength of the dollar at 1.5452/57 marks was underpinning the market and making the possibility of any serious losses unlikely.  </p>
<p>The possibility of further losses being averted depended largely on what happened on Wall Street. Wall Street took a downward turn early on and the IBIS DAX index fell accordingly to near its daily lows at 2,836.14 points, a drop of 1.53 percent.</p>
<p>At 1455 GMT the Dow Jones Industrial index was down 40.03 points at 6,408.24 points.</p>
<p>March DAX futures were also well down in late electronic trade, down 53 points at 2,851.5 points.</p>
<p>Among the big losers were the chemical stocks, whose fortunes are generally linked to the strength of the dollar.  </p>
<p>Hoechst AG was down nearly three percent at 70.10 marks, while Bayer was down 2.62 percent at 61.35 marks and BASF was down 2.40 percent at 57.73 marks.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX took a further hammering when worse-than-expected NAPM figures dragged Wall Street down further.</p>
<p>Dealers said that volumes were low and market players did not expect a resumption of normal activity until next Monday when more traders returned to work.</p>
