<headline>CBRS says ratings outlook stable for Canada banks.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-02-12</dateline>

<p>Canadian Bond Rating Service said on Wednesday its ratings outlook for Canada's big, profitable banks remained stable amid signs of continued strength over the next two years.</p>
<p>A sustainable economic recovery in Canada, the United States and parts of Europe and Asia boded well for the so-called Big Six banks, CBRS said in a semi-annual review.</p>
<p>&quot;In the context of these economic factors and the financial strength of the major Canadian banks, CBRS' rating outlook remains stable,&quot; the rating agency said.  </p>
<p>The major banks reported record combined earnings of C$6.26 billion in fiscal 1996, up 21 percent from a record C$5.18 billion in fiscal 1995.</p>
<p>The banks begin reporting their results for the first quarter ended January 31 later this month.</p>
<p>CBRS said the net non-performing loan ratio for most banks is at its lowest point in more than a decade. The banks also have a healthy level of reserves which leaves them well-positioned for a future economic downturn. &quot;The current increasing trend in consumer bankruptcies and delinquencies is not seen as a major problem overall,&quot; CBRS said.  </p>
<p>CBRS said several major issues will be at the forefront of the banking industry in 1997.</p>
<p>As the economic expansion continues and loan portfolios are growing, the banks are facing liquidity erosion as well as capital pressure.</p>
<p>Low-cost retail deposit funding is being displaced by mutual funds, creating a growing need to fund through the wholesale money markets.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that Canadian banks are all pondering asset securitization as a means of relieving these balance sheet pressures,&quot; CBRS said.  </p>
<p>Electronic banking will remain a major focus as the Big Six strive to cut costs by shifting consumers away from using tellers.</p>
<p>Bricks-and-mortar bank branches are being transformed into sales centers, CBRS said, adding that &quot;rationalization of the branch network is inevitable.&quot;</p>
<p>The group is also expected to continue to grow outside of Canada as they follow their corporate customers offshore. CBRS warned that maintaining balance sheet growth and profitability will be difficult with a &quot;Canadian-only strategy.&quot;</p>
