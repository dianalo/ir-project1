<p>Singapore copper premiums firmed this week after previous low prices triggered fresh demand while a strike at a Chilean copper mine sparked little interest, industry sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Premiums over London Metal Exchange (LME) cash prices rose to around $100 a tonne from last week's $80, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cash prices have firmed up by $25-$30 per tonne on back of techinals and good demand from the region,&quot; said a U.S trader.</p>
<p>Traders cited increased copper demand from Malaysia, on a pick-up in the cable and wire production industry, and better sales in Indonesia.</p>
<p>&quot;There is just a lack of supplies in the region,&quot; one Japanese trader said. &quot;I have received a lot of inquiries recently but I have no availability to offer.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S trader also attributed the rise in premiums to good demand from China.</p>
<p>He said Chinese buying interest emerged when LME three-month copper fell to $1,900 a tonne. Prices have since recovered to be indicated around $1,960 in early London trade on Friday.</p>
<p>But traders said the pick-up in copper prices may curb Chinese demand in the short term.</p>
<p>On Thursday, industry sources said that copper stored in Shanghai warehouses, which has baffled the market over its ownership, has been offered in small lots to European metal trading houses.</p>
<p>The copper was being offered at a high premium in order to set a benchmark price for its eventual sale to China's strategic stockpile, one Chinese trader said.</p>
<p>A European trader in Beijing said he had been offered copper by the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) at around $2,100 a tonne -- a level reflecting the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price plus a premium of $130.</p>
<p>CNIEC has previously declined to comment on the reports.</p>
<p>Traders said a stike at Chilean state mining company Codelco's Salvador copper mine had been largely discounted.</p>
<p>They said the strike had little bearing on the market as the mine was considered to be small and there was reasonable availability in the wider world market.</p>
<p>There was also a slight firming in Singapore aluminium premiums this week reflecting fresh buying interest when prices slipped to a low in mid-week, traders said. The market's fundamentals are considered steady to firm, said the U.S trader.</p>
<p>The Asian zinc market remained buoyant as it continued to garner support from a firm  U.S market, traders said.</p>
<p>They said with Southeast Asian demand growing at five percent a year and production stagnant, regional zinc prices were expected to be supported for the rest of the year.</p>
