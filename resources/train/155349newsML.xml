<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Wednesday rejected a Chinese demand to remove a lighthouse at the heart of a heated row over disputed islands in the East China Sea, Japanese officials said.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's remarks came in a meeting with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Foreign Ministry officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;As a nation ruled by law, there are legal limits to what can and cannot be done,&quot; a ministry official quoted Hashimoto as telling Tang. &quot;We must ask you to understand this.&quot;</p>
<p>Hashimoto was responding to Tang's demand that Japan tear down a lighthouse erected on one of the islands earlier this year by a Japanese ultra-nationalist group, the Japanese officials said.</p>
<p>The lighthouse triggered protests from China and Taiwan, which also claim the Japanese-controlled but uninhabited islands, called the Senkakus in Japanese and Diaoyus in Chinese. The row flared up again last month when a pro-China Hong Kong activist died during protest activities near the islands.</p>
<p>The official Japanese position on the lighthouse is that it was erected on private property and that the government has no right to remove it. However, the government has refused to sanction the lighthouse as a formal navigation aide.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Tang held talks with his Japanese counterpart Shunji Yanai and demanded that Japan remove the lighthouse. Tang said the dispute and Hashimoto's visit to a controversial shrine honouring Japanese war dead in July is souring bilateral ties.</p>
<p>The Yasukuni Shrine issue did not come up in Wednesday's brief meeting between Tang and Hashimoto, the Japanese officials said.</p>
<p>Senior Japanese Foreign Ministry officials also said Sino-Japanese relations were in the worst state since normalisation in 1978.</p>
<p>Government sources said Hashimoto was planning to send a special envoy to China, probably ex-premier Noboru Takeshita, to diffuse tensions but the matter has been set aside until the inauguration of Hashimoto's next government on November 7.</p>
<p>It remained to be seen whether Hashimoto could get ties with China back on track before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum's summit in the Philippines next month, where he is expected to hold a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</p>
