<p>Canada's Transport Minister said on Monday that he thinks the financial restructuring plan of Canadian Airlines Corp will succeed without a federal government rescue of the ailing carrier.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we will have a bankruptcy, because the Benson plan will work,&quot; David Anderson told reporters after a luncheon speech.</p>
<p>The minister was referring to a restructuring plan proposed by Canadian Airlines Chief Executive Kevin Benson, which includes, among other things, a 10 percent cut in the wages of the carrier's workers.  </p>
<p>The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW), which represents 3,700 Canadian Airlines employees, has said it is opposed to the wage cutbacks.</p>
<p>Anderson said the Canadian government has ruled out floating Canadian Airlines with a grant or loan. The Calgary-based company's operating unit, Canadian Airlines International Ltd. (CAI) is Canada's second national air carrier.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question of (the government) investing or providing any loan,&quot; Anderson said.  </p>
<p>The minister said the government would not step in with financial aid because Canadian has not asked for help and because Benson has said he would refuse such taxpayer assistance.</p>
<p>Anderson said it is up to Canadian, its employees and AMR Corp, which has a 33 percent stake in CAI, to agree on a viable restructuring plan.</p>
<p>&quot;Proposals for simply throwing money at the problem instead of carrying out a restructuring of the problem in this situation would simply not work,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
<p>&quot;After a loss over the last 10 years of C$1.3 billion we understand there must be a restructuring,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Benson's restructuring plan includes a C$48 million reduction in service fees paid annually to Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR, which owns American Airlines. -- Reuters Montreal bureau (514) 985-2434</p>
