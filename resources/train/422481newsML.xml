<p>Jakarta call money was traded at 7.5/8.0 percent on Wednesday on sustained ample liquidity.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity remained ample but operators were cautious, trying to keep aside as much liquidity as they could.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a chance for operators to prepare for higher tax payments and to boost rupiah reserves to meet the new reserve requirement rate in April,&quot; one state bank dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no joke. The rise to five percent from three percent is quite significant,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Longer-term rates remained soft on ample condition. One-month was at 10.75 and three at 13.0 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its bilateral rates stable and did not offer overnight SBIs. It offered seven-day SBIs at 6.5 percent, 14-day at 8.5 percent and one-month at 10.75 percent.</p>
<p>The average overnight interbank rate on Tuesday was at 8.28 percent. Bond dealers said prices were edging up slightly on Tuesday afternoon on sustained demand.</p>
<p>They attributed it to new mutual funds looking for attractive fixed returns in the bond market.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark PLN V/A bond eased slightly to around 15.0 percent on a price of 107.25 percent.</p>
