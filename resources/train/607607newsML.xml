<headline>Israeli official's criticism &quot;a joke&quot; - Netanyahu.</headline>

<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed as &quot;a joke&quot; criticism by the deputy finance minister who resigned this week over the Israeli leader's &quot;screw-ups&quot;.</p>
<p>The deputy minister, David Magen, quit Netanyahu's 11-month-old government on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;What did this man do for a full year at the finance ministry except renovate his office? Nothing. He criticises the government and the prime minister? It's a joke,&quot; Netanyahu said in remarks published by the newspaper Maariv on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to address these things at all,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>Magen told Israel Radio on Tuesday he was quitting so he could speak freely on matters that troubled him. He called it &quot;stupid&quot; for the prime minister to agree to give up $50 million in U.S. aid to help Jordan at a time of government budget cuts.</p>
<p>Magen said certain remarks by Netanyahu along with &quot;all sorts of major screw-ups and mistakes&quot; prompted him to quit the ministry job and devote his full efforts to parliament where he is part of Netanyahu's Likud-Gesher-Tsomet faction.</p>
