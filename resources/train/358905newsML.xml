<headline>Sony Oct-Dec entertainment oper income up 13.6 pct.</headline>

<p>Sony Corp said on Wednesday that group operating income from its entertainment units rose 13.6 percent to 31.7 billion yen in the three months to December against the same period a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Sony's entertainment revenues largely come from its troubled Hollywood film-making unit, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and record unit, Sony Music Entertainment.</p>
<p>Sony overhauled its Sony Pictures management last year, naming new heads of Sony Pictures and both its subsidiaries, Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures.</p>
<p>Sony said the sales of its cutting-edge 32-bit home game player, the PlayStation, rose significantly.</p>
<p>Sony said the yen's year-on-year decline against other major currencies increased its October/December group sales by about 110 billion yen.</p>
<p>&quot;If the value of the yen had remained the same as in the third quarter of the previous year, sales would have been approximately 110 billion yen ($948 million) lower than the reported figure,&quot; Sony said in its statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;In the entertainment business, operating income increased from the same period of the previous year, reflecting the strong performance of the music group outside Japan as well as the yen's depreciation,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Operating income in the pictures group declined from the prior year due to the disappointing performance of several motion picture releases, offset to some extent by strong television syndication profits and favourable home video results,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>In a geographical breakdown, group sales and operating revenue in the United States topped the list at 489.7 billion yen, up 31.8 percent from the same period a year earlier, followed by Japan's 459.8 billion yen, up 21.0 percent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, group sales and operating revenue in Europe rose 17.4 percent to 409.1 billion yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Overseas sales rose significantly in all geographic areas due to overall sales advances of electronics products as well as favourable sales in the entertainment business,&quot; the statement said.</p>
