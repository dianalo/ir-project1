<p>German coffee roaster J.J. Darboven told a news conference on Tuesday sales volumes in 1997 may be curtailed by necessary retail price rises.</p>
<p>The company would keep unchanged the origin mix in its high quality blends even if this was causing additional costs.</p>
<p>&quot;We will use the same green coffees as ever, we'd rather sell less coffee than compromise on quality,&quot; group chairman Albert Darboven said.</p>
<p>The family-owned group sold 25,688 tonnes of roasted coffee in 1996, up from 24,000 in 1995, but Darboven said earnings had been unsatisfactory amid a decline in retail prices, but he would not elaborate.</p>
<p>Darboven, along with most German roasters, is set to raise prices by 1.50 marks per 0.5 kg as of March 10, in a bid to pass on dramatically higher raw materials costs and an unfavourable mark/dollar ratio.</p>
<p>Further price increases have not been ruled out.</p>
<p>The 1996 German coffee market average was 7.01 marks, with Darboven's products some 0.47 marks more expensive.</p>
<p>Darboven has an estimated market share of eight to nine percent in Germany from sales in supermarkets, tied outlets in some regions, as well as hotels, canteens and airlines.</p>
<p>Within the total, sales to supermarkets rose by 8.3 percent to 13,012 tonnes while sales to users outside private households rose by five percent to 3,950 tonnes.</p>
<p>Darboven has a 10 percent share in this sector, which it said generated higher intrinsic revenue but was hit by a decline in tourism and slimmer business expense accounts.</p>
<p>International group manager Luc de Vries said the company would grow in eastern Europe, where an increase in tourism generated demand for its coffee and preparation systems. --Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275</p>
