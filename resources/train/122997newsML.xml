<p>Bear plays dominated coffee options activity this week as implied volatilities came under pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>After an uneventful expiry of November options on Wednesday, interest shifted to the second-month January $1,400 puts with coffee sellers interested in defending against the downside.</p>
<p>One strategy involved buying the January $1,400 put and selling the March $1,550 or $1,600 call to finance the put -- a deal that traders say places emphasis on protecting the buyer of the put from downside risk without having to pay up.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have coffee, you want to protect the downside and if the market goes up you have the coffee anyway,&quot; said one market maker.</p>
<p>&quot;You set the level that you are prepared to sell your coffee, and $200 above the market is quite a good sell,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Coffee futures have been trapped in a narrow range this week, with a daily dose of origin selling keeping a lid on any upside attempts.</p>
<p>Traders reckoned prices could drop further when Central American produce comes on stream after generous supplies from Africa and the Far East this year.</p>
<p>Robusta players have ignored recent bullish movements on the arabicas market, where the market had corrected lower into a good area of support. On Thursday, January futures stood $9 lower before the close at $1,425 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;The bearish fence just sums the sentiment up,&quot; said the options trader.</p>
<p>The January $1,750 and $1,900 call spread was also in the spotlight as players rolled down their strike parallel to the futures market.</p>
<p>Volatilies were a touch off last week's levels. January at-the-money calls and puts were trading around 27-29 percent while March calls came under increased pressure, trading at 24-25 percent.</p>
<p>The expiry of November options triggered some delta hedging on Wednesday as the futures approached the $1,550 mark where some 550 lots of open interest had accumulated.</p>
<p>Traders said last minute buying pushed November futures $20 higher just before the midday expiry but the contract stopped short of the options trigger at $1,547.</p>
<p>Options turnover reached 4,025 lots so far this week.</p>
