<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Wednesday were seen steady to $1.00 per cwt lower on continued light packer demand and projections for increased marketings, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Marketings were seen expanded by improved weather conditions in the Midwest following recent frigid temperatures and snow, which had slowed movement earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to the plant were seen $1.00 lower and could range $54.50 to $55.50. Illinois top prices at the plant were seen steady and could range $55.50 to $56.00.  </p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top plant prices for hogs were expected steady and could range $54.00 to $55.00.</p>
<p>Packers reportedly have enough hogs to work with and were bidding lower to offset soft pork demand, market sources said.</p>
<p>There were 60.25 loads of pork and 8.0 loads of trimmings reported sold near midday at mixed prices, USDA said in the U.S. carlot pork report.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hog receipts Wednesday were estimated at 105,000 head, compared with 90,000 a week ago and 101,000 a year ago, USDA reported.</p>
