<p>Australian bond yields were stable against a backdrop of easier U.S. Treasuries with the market reasonably confident that Thursday's quarterly wages data will not prevent a rate cut.</p>
<p>Median forecasts for second quarter average weekly ordinary time earnings, which are due at 11.30 a.m. (0130 GMT), centre on a 0.8 percent rise for an annual growth rate of 4.1 percent, according to a Reuters survey of economists.</p>
<p>Analysts said even if the outcome is the top of the expected range at 1.1 percent, it would still leave the annual rate below the Reserve Bank's 4.5 percent 'line in the sand'.  </p>
<p>&quot;All this talk of a rate cut is nothing new to the market as we've had 50 basis point priced in for sometime. But if wages come out stronger than the market thinks you could see the short end come under a lot of pressure,&quot; one bond trader said.</p>
<p>If the wages data does prove tame, there will be strong expections for a 1/2 point cut in current 5.5 percent official interest rates, even as early as Friday.</p>
<p>However, the local market's rally since April is showing signs of strain while it waits for a rate cut and the 10-year bond yield may find it difficult to go much lower that Wednesday's 3-1/2 year low of around 6.40 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's not a lot the market can do until we get a cut, unless you start looking for 75 basis points, but then you are getting into dangerous territory,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The market rallied briefly on a benign inflation report on Wednesday, which showed annual underlying inflation below the RBA's target at 1.7 percent, but the outcome was not that much below median expectations to push bond futures into uncharted territory.</p>
<p>The September 10-year bond futures contract touched a 3-1/2 year high of 93.595 on Wednesday, just short of the all-time record of 93.630.</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The market rebounded against the dollar bloc after Wednesday's underperformance which was seen as overdone given the stunningly low inflation outcome. U.S. Treasuries gave up some of Tuesday heady rally amid profit-taking.</p>
