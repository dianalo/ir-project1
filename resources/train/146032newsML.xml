<p>Apple Computer Inc., struggling to remain the teacher's pet among computer makers, is turning a modified version of its handheld Newton organizer into an inexpensive portable computer for students.</p>
<p>The computer maker on Monday will unveil the Apple eMate 300, an $800 machine that looks like a grown-up's laptop with a keyboard and a flip-up screen, but in a rugged casing that can survive rough handling.</p>
<p>Apple plans to sell the machine directly to elementary and high schools, beginning early next year, as an alternative to personal computers. For the price of a $2,500 multimedia PC, a school can buy three eMates, Apple executives said.</p>
<p>&quot;The federal government says we need to get to a three-to-one student-to-computer ratio by the year 2000,&quot; said Jim Groff, general manager of Apple's information appliances group. &quot;I would say the eMate is the only credibled vehicle for accomplishing that.&quot;</p>
<p>More vital to Apple, the product could keep educators from abandoning the company as the leading supplier of computers for classrooms, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The potential for something like this in a classroom setting is tremendous,&quot; said Mike McGuire, a mobile computing analyst at Dataquest Inc. &quot;This will be an indication to educators that Apple is one of the few companies spending time extending computing to more and more kids.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple needs a distinctive product to set itself apart from other personal computer makers crowding into the education market, analysts said.</p>
<p>Although Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., still enjoys strong educational sales, sales of IBM-compatible personal computers by companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. are growing much faster.</p>
<p>Apple's computer has always been the favored tool for teaching children how to use computers. But in the face of Apple's uncertain future and a flood of cheap PCs, schools are less likely to remain loyal.</p>
<p>For the 1996-1997 school year, of all the computers that schools plan to buy, 56 percent will be Apple Macintoshs and 40 percent IBM-compatible machines, according to a recent report by Quality Education Data, an education market researcher. In the previous school year, the purchasing plans were 61 percent Macintosh and 38 percent PC.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers are overwhelming in favor of PCs,&quot; said Carole Cotton, president of CCA Consulting Inc., another tracker of technology purchases by schools.</p>
<p>&quot;No school district can afford to make a mistake&quot; when picking computers they will use for years, she noted.</p>
<p>Apple's Groff said, however, that the eMate is not the company's answer to competitors' inroads.</p>
<p>Instead, he said, the device was built for schools asking for a cheap, powerful computer that can offer educational software and Internet connections -- as well as endure rough handling by kids.</p>
<p>&quot;When we introduced the Newton three years ago, it was a solution in search of an application,&quot; Groff said. Education turned out to be one of the best applications, he said.</p>
<p>Along with the eMate, Apple plans to unveil a beefier version of the Newton MessagePad on Monday. The new MessagePad 2000 features better Internet capabilities, easier connection to PCs and built-in word processing and spreadsheet software.</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, that the eMate is the more interesting device. Teachers and students will like it because it is not as esoteric and hard to run as a traditional personal computer.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids are having to learn more about how to run a computer than about reading and writing,&quot; McGuire said. &quot;The ability to have the kid just turn on the device and get right into the writing assigment is really valuable.&quot;</p>
<p>The eMate weighs four pounds (1.8 kg) and fits into a backpack. It can run for a week on rechargeable batteries, according to Apple.</p>
<p>The machine features a built-in word processor, drawing and equation-drawing programs and an address book. With an optional modem and software, students can browse the Internet.</p>
<p>Still, the eMate could be a tough sell for Apple.</p>
<p>Because its software is based on the Newton operating system, it cannot run the thousands of educational programs written for the Macintosh and for PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.</p>
<p>Apple executives are confident, however, that the eMate will help the company place more its computers on students' desks.</p>
<p>&quot;There's 52 million screaming (grades) K-to-12 children to sell to,&quot; said Robert Kondrk, Apple's manager of education product lines. &quot;We've known for years this is an opportunity, but we didn't have the technology to do it before. We do now.&quot;</p>
