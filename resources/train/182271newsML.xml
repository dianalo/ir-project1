<p>Defence Minster Igor Rodionov warned on Tuesday that Russia's political and economic instability had become &quot;extreme&quot; and poor military readiness could have dire consequences, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>The agency also quoted Rodionov, who has been campaigning for better funding for the army, as telling top generals that &quot;the armed forces have reached a borderline, beyond which any further fall in their combat readiness may lead to 'unpredictable, catastrophic consequences'.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;According to his words, political and economic instability in Russia have become 'extreme',&quot; Interfax said.</p>
<p>Rodionov was speaking at a meeting of Russia's top brass due to discuss results of combat training in 1996. The meeting was being attended by Kremlin chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais and Russia's top security officials.</p>
<p>Rodionov has been ringing alarm bells about the state of affairs in the military for some time, trying to get more funding for the armed forces this year and in the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>Interfax also quoted Rodionov as saying that the strategic and military situation in the world could lead to military conflicts threatening Russia's security.</p>
