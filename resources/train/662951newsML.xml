<title>UK: Eurobond focus firmly on dollars with more to come.</title>
<headline>Eurobond focus firmly on dollars with more to come.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-16</dateline>

<p>Dollar bonds continued to be the favoured Euromarket currency, with three significant transactions launched on Monday.</p>
<p>Japan-guaranteed Japan Finance Corp for Municipal Enterprises (JFM) issued a $400 million 10-year bond at 23 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes.</p>
<p>Bankers said the pricing was fair -- with a 10-year Asian Development Bank bond trading at 18 b.p. over -- but there was an overhang of supply in the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;JFM is an attractive deal but some investors have been put off by the large amount of recent supply in 10 years,&quot; a trader at a European bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't start to perform for a few days,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An official at lead manager Merrill Lynch said despite the large quantity of 10-year paper around, JFM appealed because it was the only government-guaranteed borrower.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a long time since a Japan-guaranteed borrower has tapped the market,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;At 23 b.p. over JFM looks good value. There has been a lot of interest from Asian investors in particular, with around 50 percent of the bonds placed there.&quot;</p>
<p>Abbey National's $400 million three-year bond was favoured by traders over Hitachi Credit Corp's $200 million five-year bond, which was considered slightly too tight.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) will issue a $500 million five-year bond. Spread talk was seven basis points over U.S. Treasury notes.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical could launch a $300 million five-year at 31 b.p. over via DKB and Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten might bring a $750 million to $1.0 billion five-year bond at around 10 b.p. over.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Russia's 10-year bond for at least $1.0 billion is expected to surface. Spread talk was around 375 b.p. over.</p>
