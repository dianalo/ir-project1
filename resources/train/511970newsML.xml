<title>BELGIUM: Global role seen for Australian zinc industry.</title>

<p>Australia's new zinc mine developments and increasing production mean that the country will have an important ongoing role in the global zinc industry, an Australian industry expert said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Addressing the Zinc and its Markets conference in Brussels, Rob Webster of Western Metals Ltd said the market for zinc concentrate and refined metal was moving through a period of robust, steady growth in demand, particularly in galvanising.</p>
<p>&quot;The medium-term outlook for mine and smelter production suggests expected capacity over the next several years may well fall short of the market's requirements,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The zinc market was suffering from a structural deficit, with the decline in exports from eastern bloc countries likely to accelerate towards the end of the decade as industrial production in these countries increased.</p>
<p>Also, China was expected to become a net importer of concentrate, and possibly metal, towards the end of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Given Australia's proximity to east Asia, the country could be well placed to benefit from rapid economic growth in the region provided companies made sure costs were not such that they could not continue &quot;in bad times&quot;, Webster said.</p>
<p>Australian zinc production was currently at record levels, with mine production from 11 operations resulting in aggregate output of around one million tonnes.</p>
<p>However, much of Australia's future production was already contracted to European smelters, &quot;leaving a significant imbalance in the region&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Webster cited forecasts which put world economic growth at 4.0 percent in 1997 but east Asian growth at 7.0 percent. By 2001 world growth would be 3.7 percent but east Asia would still outpace it, growing at 6.3 percent.</p>
<p>World slab zinc consumption would grow to 8.587 million tonnes metal in 2001 from 7.525 million in 1996, while in east Asia the amounts would be 1.552 million tonnes in 2001 and 1.208 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Net Australian zinc in concentrate production capacity was expected to rise by 250,000 tonnes, or 25 percent, in 2001, with North American production remaining broadly steady, modest gains expected in South America and a significant increase in new capacity in Europe.</p>
