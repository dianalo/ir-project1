<p>Newcastle's title hopes face another severe test on Saturday when second-placed Arsenal visit St James' Park looking for their first win there since November 1988.</p>
<p>Both teams are looking to bounce back from midweek defeats in the League Cup and Saturday's game will be an indication of the resilience of both sides.</p>
<p>Newcastle were despatched 3-1 by Middlesbrough while Arsenal went down 4-2 at Liverpool in which their ageing, but usually still-firm defence was exposed by some incisive Liverpool raids.</p>
<p>Newcastle, boosted by the return of England skipper Alan Shearer last week, will again be without Shearer's England strike partner Les Ferdinand who is expected to return in a fortnight after recovering from a fractured cheek bone. He is back in training, but will not be available on Saturday.</p>
<p>Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan is likely to recall  defender John Beresford, who suffered a calf injury during their UEFA Cup tie in France against Metz 10 days ago.</p>
<p>For Arsenal, Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp remains doubtful with a thigh strain while England goalkeeper David Seaman is out with a rib problem. Their places are likely to go again to Welsh striker John Hartson and veteran goalkeeper John Lukic who both played in the Liverpool defeat.</p>
<p>Even without Ferdinand, Newcastle have a potent strike-force which, like Liverpool, will put the 30-something backline of Lee Dixon, Steve Bould, Tony Adams and Nigel Winterburn to the test.</p>
<p>Following last week's blood-and-guts local derby with Tottenham, followed by Wednesday's defeat at Anfield, another severe examination will say plenty about just how seriously Arsenal's title challenge is to be taken. Newcastle are currently on 29 points, Arsenal on 28.</p>
<p>	 Bould, who was 34 earlier this month and scored the</p>
<p>winning goal when Arsenal last won at Newcastle, told the London Evening Standard on Friday: &quot;I can't think that any other team in modern football has had the same defenders together for as long as us. I don't know what the secret is. Perhaps it's simply that we have Tony Adams.&quot;</p>
<p>Bould was sent off at Liverpool but is eligible to play on Saturday which means Arsenal will field the same back four as they did in their last win at Newcastle eigtht years ago.</p>
<p>Adams is likely to again be the dominant force at the back and was inspirational when Arsenal beat Tottenham 3-1 last week, scoring Arsenal's second -- and what was effectively the winner -- with two minutes to go. Adams, like Bould has been playing far more forward under new French coach Arsene Wenger than he ever did under long-time coach George Graham, and their forays into the attack have added a new dimension to Arsenal's play with opposing fans jeers of &quot;Boring, boring Arsenal&quot; now rendered obsolete.</p>
<p>Since Newcastle beat Manchester United 5-0 five weeks ago, their league results have been mixed with a win, a defeat and two draws.</p>
<p>Including cup matches they have drawn three and lost one of their last four and will be anxious to end a relatively bad run and at least repeat their 2-0 win over Arsenal in this fixture last season.</p>
<p>A week after that game last January Newcastle lost an ill-tempered League Cup quarter-final 2-0 at Highbury in which Frenchman David Ginola was sent off for a foul on Dixon and rival managers Keegan and Bruce Rioch were involved in angry exchanges with each other on the touchline.</p>
<p>Rioch has since gone, Wenger has arrived and Arsenal have flourished under his new, enlightened leadership. Last time Arsenal won at Newcastle, they ended the season as champions. A repeat performance on Saturday would reduce the odds of history repeating itself, but Newcastle have learnt plenty of lessons since last season -- and Shearer would like nothing better to get the better of his England team-mate Adams and move Newcastle four points clear at the top.</p>
