<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin began a new summer holiday on Monday but would remain in control of affairs of state, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;The head of state's holiday has only just begun,&quot; the agency quoted Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying, adding that the president was currently in a Kremlin residence near Moscow.  </p>
<p>Interfax said Yastrezhembsky did not exclude that Yeltsin could spend some time in other places. He would continue working on various documents and might meet &quot;one state offical or another&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;One must give B. Yeltsin a chance to rest and recover his health after the elections,&quot; Interfax quoted Yastrezhembsky as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;(Yeltsin) controls internal and international policies, daily receives a big packet of documents from Moscow, which demand his intervention...Many of those documents return to the president's administration the same day,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin went on a two-day trip outside Moscow last week to check out a holiday home.</p>
