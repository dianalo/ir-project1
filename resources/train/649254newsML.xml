<title>UK: British watchdog sees petrol review done by autumn.</title>
<headline>British watchdog sees petrol review done by autumn.</headline>

<p>The Director General of Fair Trading confirmed on Tuesday that a review of the wholesale and retail petrol markets in Britain was already underway and he will decide by this autumn whether further actions were necessary.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Office of Fair Trading said earlier that it would soon launch a review of allegations that the ferociously competitive petrol market was driving independent retailers out of business.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect our review to be completed by the autumn and I will then decide whether there are any issues which merit closer examination by the MMC (Monopolies and Mergers Commission) or whether some other remedy is necessary,&quot; John Bridgeman, Director General of Fair Trading, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The OFT was already committed to carrying out a review this year, following the previous one in 1993, and consultants have been hired to assist in the processing and analysis of data on the market, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are examining the effects of changes in the market's structure since the MMC report of 1990,&quot; he said. &quot;This will, of course, include the move of supermarkets into petrol retailing and the effect of this on other outlets.&quot;</p>
<p>A price war in the UK petrol market was sparked in early 1996 after Esso Petroleum, a unit of U.S. oil giant Exxon Corp, launched its Pricewatch campaign promising to match its lowest-priced competitors.</p>
<p>The growing presence of supermarkets, who sell petrol at the cheapest prices, and a downstream industry ripe with overcapacity also led to a near 10 percent reduction in the number of filling stations last year, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>A Parliamentary hearing last year explored whether motorists were enjoying unrealistically cheap petrol prices, which on average are the cheapest in Europe.</p>
