<p>Russia, plagued by a breakdown in law and order after the fall of communism, is now winning the battle against crime, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the difficulties of the transition period, the criminal situation is under control,&quot; Kulikov said during a meeting with British Home Secretary Michael Howard.</p>
<p>He said overall crime fell 4.7 percent in 1996, with 2.6 million registered crimes. The total number of murders last year -- 29,406 -- fell below 30,000 for the first time in several years, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are completely satisfied that the number of serious crimes, including murder, was down 10.5 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kulikov, speaking briefly in front of reporters at the start of the meeting, made no mention of the high-profile criminal groups which appear to operate at will in Russia.</p>
<p>A series of murders -- such as the apparent contract killing of a prominent American businessman at the entrance to a Moscow subway -- remains unsolved.</p>
<p>Many crimes, including rape, go unreported because victims consider it futile to turn to the authorities.</p>
<p>But Kulikov commended the work of the police and said 75 percent of all murders were solved. &quot;This allows us to conclude that most regional internal affairs organs are highly capable and professional,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said, however, that crime increased in 18 regions of Russia, especially in the northern Caucasus which he said was partially related to the turmoil in separatist Chechnya.</p>
