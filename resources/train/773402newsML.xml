<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. cash crude prices were mostly steady  for grade differentials, while outright crude levels declined in a  sluggishly traded Friday session.</p>
<p>September West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was 10-15 cents weaker at  $19.95-20.05 a barrel, with the September/October roll at minus 10-6  cents.</p>
<p>The combination of summer trading patterns and the &quot;day-after&quot; effect  of an industry function in Houston Thursday night, resulted in a quiet  morning for players.</p>
<p>Midland/WTI was the only grade heard sold, done at a steady 28 cents  discount to the September WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>Other barrels in the Gulf attracted steady to slightly weaker bids,  led by Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James at premiums of 22-26 cents  and Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire at 25-15 cents under WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>West Texas Sour/Midland faded to talk at -$1.50/40, after selling  mostly between $1.40-35 under benchmark this week.</p>
<p>Gauging when Iraqi oil will be lifted for export again is the standard  concern in the market. Signals from the United Nations indicate approval  of Baghdad's aid distribution plan early next week, eliminating the  final bureaucratic delay to implementing the second round of &quot;oil-for-food&quot;  accord sales.</p>
<p>Reports said U.S. trader Bayoil had provisionally fixed a 337,000  deadweight tonne tanker to sail with Iraqi crude from the Turkish  port of Ceyhan.</p>
<p>&quot;The way it looks is that Bayoil and others expect to see that oil  back on the market at the start of August,&quot; said a crude broker in  the Gulf.</p>
