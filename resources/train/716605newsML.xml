<p>U.S. municipal bond prices ended Wednesday's session up about 1/4 to 3/8 point, as traders said new issues received good demand.</p>
<p>&quot;There was institutional selling in here, but most of these deals did pretty well,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I saw a lot of retail in there, too, so maybe 'retail/retail' has finally acclimated to the new levels here,&quot; he added, referring to increased to demand from individual retail investors, as opposed to retail investors represented by mutual funds.</p>
<p>Traders also noted that the Blue List of secondary market offerings had dropped to $1 billion from about $1.5 billion over the past several sessions, another indication of a pick-up in demand.</p>
<p>Market participants said the stronger government market also led munis higher on Wednesday, as the long bond rose 10/32 at 100-27/32 to yield 6.56 percent.</p>
<p>Government securities held onto midday gains after the Treasury auctioned $8 billion of inflation-indexed 5-year notes at an average yield of 3.744 percent. Analysts predicted a yield in the range of 3.72 percent to 3.74 percent.</p>
<p>In late day muni repricings, Lehman Brothers said it lowered yields in several maturities on California Housing Finance Agency's $134 million bond deal.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. said it repriced Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's $120 million bond deal, lowering maturities five basis points in all maturities.</p>
<p>In competitive action, Bear Stearns said it had a $58.6 million balance on the day's largest new issue, a $265 million Washington general obligation offering.</p>
<p>In the muni secondary, bids on Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, Pa., MBIA 5-3/8s of 2024 fell three basis points from Tuesday's close to 5.50 percent.</p>
<p>Florida Ports Financing Commission MBIA 5-3/8s of 2027 were two basis points lower, at 5.56 percent.</p>
<p>Muni futures also showed improvement. September futures closed 10/32 higher to 119-11/32, while September T-bonds were 9/32 higher at 113-29/32. The MOB spread widened to 174 ticks from 173 at the close Tuesday.</p>

<p>Negotiated offerings total $197 million in seven sales, with a $100 million Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey deal through Lehman Brothers topping the list.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, 10 sales totaling $165 million are scheduled. A $40 million Kansas City deal at 1000 EDT is the largest.</p>
<p>Thursday's economic indicators include initial claims for the week ended July 5. Economists surveyed by Reuters expect the figure, which is set for release at 0830 EDT, to be 341,000.</p>
