<p>Children playing with a computer near a Buddhist temple on the banks of the river Ganges gave Oscar-winning Gabriele Salvatores the spark for &quot;Nirvana&quot;, a nightmarish sci-fi plunge into cyber-space.</p>
<p>&quot;I was in India in Benares and I saw the children by the temple. That made me think that the central question of Buddhist philosophy is that the life we lead is not real,&quot; the Italian director, 44, said in a beach interview at the Cannes film festival on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The same goes for virtual reality, and it will be more and more difficult to establish the difference between reality and non-reality,&quot; the director said of his latest movie, which is light years away from the bitter-sweet &quot;Mediterraneo&quot; which won him the Oscar for best foreign film in 1991.</p>
<p>Videogame designer Jimmy (Christophe Lambert), under pressure to meet a Christmas 2005 deadline for his latest creation, sees his life take a turn for the worse when his computer hero Solo (Diego Abbantuono) suddenly rebels at the futility of a role in which he is shot dead again and again after each &quot;Game Over&quot;.</p>
<p>In his quest to zap Solo out of cyberspace -- the only relief Jimmy can give him -- the computer wizard goes on the run in a megalopolis carved into ghettos, including an Indian-inspired underground city where religion co-exists with high technology.</p>
<p>Cyber-enthusiasts navigate clandestinely between reality and virtual reality, sometimes having their brains sucked out by the computer network's police in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't change your destiny just like that. If you can't change the game, the only way out is to stop playing. It's suicide, that's true, but it's not really a negative choice,&quot; said Salvatores, whose credits include &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot; and &quot;Puerto Escondido&quot;.</p>
<p>Special effects and humour feature prominently in the oppressive universe Salvatores took three years to create for &quot;Nirvana&quot;, produced by a French firm and distributed by Miramax in the United States.</p>
<p>Locations were scouted in Morocco and India before the team decided to film in the plant of a former Alfa Romeo factory in Milan.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a European film, even if it's a science-fiction movie. If I'd been American, I'm not sure I would have put humour in such a film.</p>
<p>&quot;Humour is my way of seeing things. And there's something comical about seeing characters in a video game trying to rebuild their lives,&quot; Salvatores said.</p>
<p>His theme, which he dubs &quot;contamination between man and machine&quot;, echoes last year's Cannes shocker &quot;Crash&quot; by David Cronenberg which tracked the sexual highs of perverts obsessed by car crashes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very philosophical thriller, which raises many questions but even in this virtual universe, it preserves its European character,&quot; said Emmanuelle Seigner, who haunts Lambert in the film.</p>
