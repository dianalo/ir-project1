<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer on Friday warned that fixed exchange rates between nations lacking sufficient convergence would be both dangerous and counterproductive.</p>
<p>Speaking about globalisation in general, Tietmeyer said such developments were important and gaining momentum, but stressed &quot;fixed exchange rates with insufficient convergence would be dangerous and counterproductive&quot;.</p>
<p>Such a fixed system would sooner or later lead to conflict between nations and would not stand up to the test of unforgiving financial markets in the long term.</p>
<p>In fact, Tietmeyer added that in today's multi-faceted world of large industrial nations and regions, the necessary political and economic convergence could hardly be achieved or be secured for the long term.</p>
<p>&quot;Cooperation always becomes difficult when it needs to pull all nations into one boat,&quot; he said. &quot;We already see how difficult it is to make tax systems compatible, let alone harmonise them, within the European Union.&quot;</p>
<p>European countries are currently working towards economic and monetary union, scheduled to begin in January 1999 with a single euro currency.</p>
<p>Turning to the euro, Tietmeyer said: &quot;It cannot be ruled out, that in a case of extreme political differences, for example between Europe and the United States, that there could be certain phases of greater (international exchange rate) fluctuation.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tietmeyer added that a sustainable and stable euro would without doubt bring benefits, such as lower interest rates and improved competition.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank president warned, however, that the euro could not automatically lead to Europe's economic success, stressing that such success depended largely on how willing and able nations were to deal with their structural problems.</p>
<p>The German central bank, seen as Europe's most uncompromising defender of currency stability, was formulating its policy with the best interests of the euro in mind, Tietmeyer said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what the Bundesbank is working for -- not because we have a fetish for stability, but out of our reponsibility for a permanently competitive, prosperous and at the same time conflict-free Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
