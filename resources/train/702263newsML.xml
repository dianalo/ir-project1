<title>USA: U.S. Plains fed cattle near standstill - feedlots.</title>
<headline>U.S. Plains fed cattle near standstill - feedlots.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sales near midday Wednesday were too slow in Kansas for a market test and inactive in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area, several feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Packer bids were light at $62.00 per cwt and passed by owners pricing cattle at $63.00.</p>
<p>Outlooks for further sales at $63.00 were slim amid ideas that active trade at that level on Tuesday, combined with hefty supplies of formulated and contract cattle provided packers with comfortable inventories for next week, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we go to $62.00, its going to be real tough, because some people are already starting to lose money at $63.00,&quot; a Kansas cattle feeder said.</p>
<p>At $63.00, owners were breaking even or losing $10.00 to $15.00 per head, or more, depending on when the cattle were put on feed and on feed costs, sources said.</p>
<p>Current declining feed costs softened the impact from weak fed cattle prices, but not enough to prevent some owners from losing money, they said.</p>
<p>Major packers will be closed on Friday, July 4, in observance of the U.S. Independence Day holiday.</p>
