<p>Clean tanker rates in most major lifting sectors on Friday held steady in thin activity, brokers said.</p>
<p>Middle East activity was lacklustre with rates on 55,000 tonners to Japan settling at W167.5.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was generally slow and they expected rates to remain flat until mid-September.</p>
<p>No 70,000 tonners were fixed though Mitsubishi took one of two vessels to Japan on the 55,000 tonner Sitamona.</p>
<p>There were a dearth of fixtures in the Mediterranean/Black Sea region.</p>
<p>Demand in the UK/Continent for 20,000 tonners was extremely thin, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been quieter on the smaller ships. We've only seen activity involving a 60,000 tonne cargo,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Rates remained at W195, but brokers said there was an underlying strength in the market amid a perceived lack of tonnage.</p>
<p>Brokers said rates in the Caribbean up the U.S coast had fallen. Vessels carrying 30,000 tonne cargoes slipped 15 Worldscale points to W225.</p>
