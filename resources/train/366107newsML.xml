<p>WellPoint Health Networks Inc's Executive Vice President for Finance and Information Services Howard Phanstiel said the company was comfortable with reports that it may beat 1996 earnings per share consensus estimates of $2.98.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Smith Barney Healthcare Services Conference in New York, Phanstiel said the company sees 15 percent compounded annual growth in earnings per share going forward to the year 2000.</p>
<p>WellPoint reported third quarter earnings of $0.68 per share.  </p>
<p>Phanstiel also said that the company hopes to close the acquisition of the group health and related businesses of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co by the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>WellPoint had announced earlier in February that the deal had not closed at the end of January as had been expected because of a suit filed by SelectCare Inc, a Detroit network manager of doctors and hospitals, which alleged that the deal would violate certain agreements between SelectCare and John Hancock.  </p>
<p>Speaking of medical cost trends, Phanstiel said that cost trends increases in California were zero to negative in 1996 and about five percent nationally.  He said he sees a two to three percent trend increase next year in California and a continuing rate of five percent nationally.  He added that he expected premiums to rise so that margins would remain the same.</p>
