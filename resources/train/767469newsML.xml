<headline>FOCUS - Chinese still seen short after zinc plunge.</headline>

<p>A spectacular 20 percent plunge in world zinc prices in just one hour, on rumours that beleaguered Chinese smelters had covered huge loss-making short positions, was only partly justified, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they're still short,&quot; a Japanese dealer said in Singapore following Tuesday's drama, when three-month zinc prices shed nearly $300 a tonne from seven-year highs in frenzied early trade on the London Metal Exchange (LME).  </p>
<p>&quot;I believe they tried their best to reduce their positions. I don't think they managed to reduce it all in one day. The fall in zinc prices yesterday was caused more by the fact that the price could not be supported by fundamentals,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The metal hit a low of $1,370 before recovering to close at $1,480, compared with a seven-year peak of $1,675 on Monday.</p>
<p>A Chinese industry official told Reuters on Wednesday the sharp fall in zinc was still not enough to wipe out the losses faced by its smelters who maintained net short positions.  </p>
<p>&quot;We still need to wait. The drop is not enough,&quot; the official from China National Nonferrous Metals Corp's (CNNC) import and export company said by telephone from Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We must see how much the difference is between the current price and the price at which we sold,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the difference is still very big, it is difficult to offset all the short positions.&quot;</p>
<p>The official said the smelters would rather deliver on their contracts than lose money.  </p>
<p>A metals dealer in Tokyo said he believed relatively large amounts of short positions remained in the September zinc contract on the LME, which would cause further volatility.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think fundamentals in the zinc market are bearish. The world markets, especially the European market, are still tight on good demand,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Zinc may recover above $1,400 and will be supported at the level,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The smelters had faced huge losses on their zinc contracts -- at one point estimated at over $100 million -- after selling between 200,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the metal when prices reached $1,100 a tonne earlier this year.</p>
<p>On Monday, a senior Chinese industry source said between a half and two-thirds of the Zhuzhou smelter's estimated 90,000 tonnes of short positions had had already been covered.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, a Chinese smelter official said the &quot;short&quot; position was still intact.  </p>
<p>Japanese dealers generally were sceptical about rumours that a deal had been struck between Chinese short holders and major Swiss metal merchant Glencore, believed to be on the other side of the market, controlling many of the long positions.</p>
<p>Singapore-based dealers were divided on the extent to which the Chinese smelters had managed to cover their positions.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure the Chinese covered part of it. But the extent of how far they've squared their position is difficult to say,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>He noted that the backwardation, the premium of spot to forward prices, in LME zinc remained high. That would indicate some of the short positions are still there.</p>
<p>&quot;Rightfully, the back shouldn't be at this level. The market (in three-month zinc) should be back to $1,300-$1,370 if the Chinese had squared their positions,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The cash to three months backwardation remained volatile and was indicated at $70 at the LME close on Tuesday, compared with $50 bid earlier in the day and nearly $100 on Monday.</p>
<p>Another Singapore-based dealer disagreed and said he was certain the Chinese had covered almost all their positions.  </p>
<p>&quot;I would think they've pretty much liquidated it. At least 80 percent. They've been squeezed out of their shorts. If they are still short, the market would be up in the air.&quot;</p>
