<p>Russia's embattled government won a key victory on Sunday when it persuaded parliament, dominated by the communist and nationalist opposition, to approve the 1997 draft budget on its first reading.</p>
<p>Visibly relieved that a threat to Russia's economic stability had been lifted, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin hailed the decision as a triumph for good sense and cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;I am satisfied. There is nothing that I could take offence at today,&quot; he told reporters as he left the State Duma (lower house of parliament).</p>
<p>&quot;In our country we have so many problems, we need to work like this all the time,&quot; Chernomyrdin said.</p>
<p>The draft will go to second and third readings on December 25, the day President Boris Yeltsin is expected to make his first trial visit to the Kremlin after heart surgery last month.</p>
<p>After Sunday's vote, the presidential press service quoted Yeltsin as saying he valued the joint efforts of the government and the Duma to get the budget approved. The president is currently recuperating at a country residence outside Moscow.</p>
<p>The draft will be submitted to the upper chamber, the Federation Council, after its third reading in the Duma.</p>
<p>The Communist Party said it had decided to back the government's spending plans in the interests of national unity. Its leaders had called for a rejection of the draft on December 6 when the budget was last debated.</p>
<p>&quot;The style of work characterised by confrontation with the executive power does not take us anywhere. We need to change our style,&quot; said Yuri Maslyukov, a leading communist and chairman of the Duma committee for economic policy.</p>
<p>Echoing this view, Nikolai Kharitonov, leader of the conservative Agrarian Party faction, said: &quot;Our main task now is to pass this disgusting budget with one aim in mind -- to maintain stability in society.&quot;</p>
<p>Not all deputies agreed. Nationalist Sergei Baburin, who is also deputy speaker of the Duma, said the government and most opposition parties had cut a deal at the expense of ordinary Russians struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p>The communists and their allies had initially opposed the budget partly because they said it did not allocate enough funds to protect millions of Russians who have lost out during the country's painful shift to a market economy.</p>
<p>In a bid to win the opposition's support Chernomyrdin vowed to pay most government debts and create an investment fund.</p>
<p>But Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov told parliament on Sunday that the opposition reserved the right to block the budget in later readings if these conditions were not met.</p>
<p>He also urged Yeltsin to sack Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's chief of staff and a hate figure for the opposition which says he has amassed unlimited power during Yeltsin's illness.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, who celebrated four years at his post on Saturday, denied the government had made compromises.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not say that we came to any agreements or conditions,&quot; he told NTV. He said most of the communists' proposals were in the budget anyway but said some articles could be reviewed in later readings.</p>
<p>Chubais's position was not linked to the budget. &quot;I would not want the main law on the economy, the budget, the law by which the country lives, to be mixed up with politics,&quot; Chernomyrdin said.</p>
<p>The government also received a boost on Friday from the International Monetary Fund which decided to renew monthly payouts of a $10 billion loan to Russia.</p>
<p>The IMF gave the go-ahead for the release of roughly $336 million, citing &quot;improved revenue performance&quot;. It had previously criticised Russia's tax collection record.</p>
