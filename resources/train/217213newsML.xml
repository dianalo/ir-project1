<headline>NZ's Labour and Alliance representatives to meet.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-11-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Labour Party leader Helen Clark and Alliance Party leader Jim Anderton on Wednesday said representatives of their parties would meet at 5.00 p.m. (0400 GMT).</p>
<p>They said the two parties would discuss the &quot;issues paper&quot; prepared by the Alliance some weeks ago, and the issue of support for a Labour-New Zealand First government.</p>
<p>New Zealand First holds the balance of power after inconclusive elections last month and has been negotiating separately with both the National caretaker government and the Labour opposition party to form a coalition.  </p>
<p>Labour and New Zealand First jointly hold 54 seats in the 120-seat parliament against 53 for National, Act and United. The Alliance has said it would remain outside a coalition, but could give support on certain matters.</p>
<p>The Alliance has presented a policy paper to Clark, covering issues such as health, education, superannuation, the environment and foreign investment.</p>
