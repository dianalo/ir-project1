<p>ReliaStar Financial Corp and Security-Connecticut Corp said Wednesday they reached further agreement regarding the previously announced acquisition of Security-Connecticut by ReliaStar.</p>
<p>Terms were amended since, based on the recent closing prices of ReliaStar common stock, it is probable that the exchange price in the deal will exceed $64.30 a share, the companies said.  </p>
<p>Security-Connecticut said its board has indicated that, if conditions of the merger have been satisfied on June 24, it expects to designate a lower exchange ratio for the deal and to declare a special cash dividend of $0.67 a share prior to the closing.</p>
<p>ReliaStar said it had advised Security-Connectict that it would exercise its right to terminate the deal unless Security-Connecticut designated a lower exchange ratio.</p>
<p>ReliaStar also said it is willing to consent to the special dividend, which would effectively increase the total transaction value to $50.50 per outstanding share of Security-Connecticut stock.</p>
<p>In February, ReliaStar said it would acquire Security-Connecticut in a stock exchange deal that was valued at the time at $488 million, including debt. Under that agreement, the final exchange radio would be determined based on the average closing price of ReliaStar common stock during a 20-day trading period preceding the date on which all conditions for the merger are satisfied or waived.</p>
<p>ReliaStar shares were off one at 69-1/8. Security-Connecticut shares were off 1/8 at 51-1/4.</p>
