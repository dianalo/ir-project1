<title>DENMARK: Bonds, bucks boost Danish shares.</title>
<headline>Bonds, bucks boost Danish shares.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-04-09</dateline>

<p>Danish share prices closed higher on Wednesday, boosted by renewed buying interest, the firmer dollar and a recovering local bond market.</p>
<p>&quot;The positive undertone on the market looks like continuing, it seems that investors have regained confidence. The market could well continue further up tomorrow, provided that U.S. shares behave themselves (this evening),&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 1.61 point up, at 154.04, in overall bourse turnover of 1.17 billion crowns. The KFX June future rose 1.45 point to 153.70, with 40 contracts, each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Attention on Thursday will be on Sophus Berendsen and A.P.Moeller, both due to publish their 1996 annual reports.</p>
<p>Analysts, on average, expect Berendsen to announce a 47 percent increase in profits before tax and associated company earnings. Its share closed two crowns up, at 827 crowns.</p>
<p>Dealers said that results for A.P.Moeller, which gives few clues to earnings and costs, were hard to predict. The group's two constituent shares D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg were respectively up 1,000 crowns to 184,000 and unchanged at 264,000 crowns.</p>
