<p>This is how major world bond markets were trading in late European business on Tuesday.</p>
<p>GERMANY - German Bunds gave up some gains in late trading after failing to move convincingly above the key 97.00 level but traders remained unruffled saying no immediate sell-off was in sight. The December Bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) was trading at 96.77, down 0.05 from Monday's settlement price.</p>
<p>BRITAIN - UK gilt futures shed their earlier gains to end unchanged on the day following a slide in U.S. Treasuries prompted by Fed Governor Janet Yellen's comments on the U.S. entering an inflationary danger zone. The September long gilt future on LIFFE was trading at 107-08/32, unchanged from Monday's settlement price.</p>
<p>FRANCE - French bonds pared early gains to settle slightly higher after bearish comments on inflation from a U.S. central banker fanned fears of a U.S. interest rate rise, sending U.S. bonds lower late in the session. The September notional bond future on the MATIF in Paris settled at 123.90 up 0.08 from Monday's settlement price.</p>
<p>ITALY - Italian bonds and futures continued their positive tone seen in the past four sessions and closed firmer, but off session highs, boosted by the firmer lira tracking the strong dollar and with the market more optimistic over the country's key 1997 budget, traders said. The December bond future on LIFFE was trading at 116.53 up 0.23 from Monday's settlement price.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - U.S. Treasury prices traded at session lows at midday with securities after remarks by Federal Reserve Board Governor prompted the loss of early gains and pushed the market lower, market analysts said. The September Treasury bond future on the Chicago Board of Trade was trading at 107-06/32, down 18/32 from Monday's settlement price. The long bond was quoted to yield 7.13 percent.</p>
<p>JAPAN - Key December Japanese Goverment Bonds (JGB) futures closed slightly down, as Tokyo stocks rallied and BOJ conducted a tight operation. In after hours trading the September future on LIFFE was trading at 121.20, down 0.05 from Monday's settlement price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>EUROBONDS - Jumbo deals were launched thick and fast Tuesday in one of the primary market's busiest mornings of the year. EIB and TVA launched their back-to-back swapped 10-year dollar and mark offerings. Both will be priced later. Italy emerged with a $1.5 billion five-year deal that had been advertised in Asia as a $1.0 billion deal. It will not be increased. Pricing due at 24 b.p. over. Spain surprised players with a 150 billion yen 10-year.</p>
