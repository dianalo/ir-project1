<headline>NZ dollar steady at the close, seen range-bound.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-10-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The New Zealand dollar trod water around the 70 U.S. cent mark on Tuesday to close just a touch firmer, and dealers expected it remain bound within its US$0.6985-7010 range for the time being.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just trapped in that range,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;There still seem to be good sellers on any rally above 70 (US) cents and certainly there's buying interest between 0.6980 and 0.6990.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kiwi closed at 0.6995/02 and at 66.76 on its Trade-Weighted Index, up slightly from its 0.6987/94 and 66.70 local open.  </p>
<p>One dealer said the Australian dollar had been a bit weaker on the day and had weighed on the Kiwi, but continued Eurokiwi issuance was almost an expectation these days and was keeping the New Zealand currency comfortably within its present range.</p>
<p>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development set a NZ$100 million April 1998 issue overnight.</p>
<p>There were rumours in the market of a large samurai issue, but no confirmed reports. Debt market dealers said rumours suggested a NZ$400-$450 million samurai may have gone through.</p>
<p>The Kiwi was seen trading a 0.6985-7010 range overnight.</p>
