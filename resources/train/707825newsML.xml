<p>---------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* Canada's dollar opened flat at C$1.3740 (US$0.7278) in light trading on Friday after a touch of profit-taking last night in overseas trading, traders said. * They said the Canadian dollar would trade within a narrow range of C$1.3730 (US$0.7283) and C$1.3755 (US$0.7270) with U.S. markets closed for the July 4 Independence Day holiday.  </p>
<p>Wateridge said that an apparent economic slowdown in the United States had created an ideal environment for continued strengthening of the Canadian currency.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided at the end of its Federal Open Market Committee meeting that unexpectedly low economic growth in the second quarter justified a decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that U.S. non-farm payrolls grew by only 217,000 in June, while unemployment rose to five percent from 4.8 percent.  </p>
<p>Analysts had said that any number over 240,000 would have been considered inflationary and led to some weakening in the value of the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>The tame numbers were spawning a strong Canada dollar rally that would likely continue through next week, said one trader at a Canadian bank.</p>
<p>Overseas, all eyes were on the British pound, which has soared against major currencies as investors take advantage of Britain's robust economic growth and rising interest rates.</p>
<p>The pound is at a five-year high against the German mark.  </p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canadian dollar dipped to 82.58 Japanese yen from Thursday's 82.68 yen and climbed to 1.2752 German marks from Thursday's 1.2749 marks.</p>
