<p>About 75,000 supporters of Sri Lanka's ruling People's Alliance government gathered in Colombo on Saturday in a show of strength ahead of local elections, party sources said.</p>
<p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike addressed the 12th annual convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the main political group of the eight-party ruling alliance.</p>
<p>Local government elections are scheduled to be held before the end of April.</p>
<p>The polls, postponed three times by Kumaratunga's government using emergency regulations that govern the country, are seen as the first test of the People's Alliance's popularity after it won presidential and general elections in 1994.</p>
<p>The polls were originally due to be held by the end of June, 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Whilst fighting a brutal war (against separatist minority Tamil guerrillas), we have launched several major development programmes for our people,&quot; Kumaratunga told the gathering.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced we will win the local government elections handsomely,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The opposition United National Party (UNP), which ruled for 17 years before the alliance, controls more than 75 percent of local government bodies.</p>
<p>The government has not yet announced a date for the election, but has called for nominations to be handed over on February 5.</p>
<p>The UNP accused the government of using the emergency to disguise its unpopularity prompted by high inflation and a perceived inability to defeat the rebels on the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did the government postpone elections? Because they can't face the public,&quot; UNP's general secretary Gamini Athukorala said. &quot;They know they are heading towards a political earthslip.&quot;</p>
<p>Emergency rule was imposed to deal with a 14-year war against Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in this predominantly Sinhalese island's north and east.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war.</p>
<p>The government earlier scrapped plans to hold the election in the north and east after moderate Tamil political parties said the region was not conducive for a free and fair poll.</p>
<p>&quot;But we're rooting for the government in this election,&quot; said Mavai Senathiraja, an MP for the Tamil United Liberation Front, a moderate Tamil party with five seats in Sri Lanka's 225-member parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;If they win, it is a clear sign that the people approve of the government and its policies,&quot; Senathiraja said.</p>
<p>The government needs the people's approval if it is to get a peace plan it has proposed aimed at ending the war passed through parliament and then at a referrendum.</p>
<p>The peace plan, devolving wide-ranging powers to Tamils through a constitutional rivision, is currently being debated by a parliamentary select committee.</p>
<p>Tamil parties support the plan, but the UNP, whose votes are needed to get it passed through parliament, has yet to say where it stands.</p>
<p>&quot;The government winning this election would send a message to the UNP. They would have less reason not to support the plan,&quot; Senathiraja said.</p>
