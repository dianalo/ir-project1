<p>German phone titan Deutsche Telekom set bells ringing on the Tokyo stock market on Tuesday as Japanese investors and dealers rushed to trade the newly listed share.</p>
<p>By the end of the day more than seven million Deutsche Telekom shares had changed hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as Japan joined the trading frenzy seen in Europe and the United States on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue was popular even before it listed all over the world,&quot; said Tadahiro Kamogawa, general manager of the stock information department at Yamaichi Securities. &quot;It's only natural that the shares got off to a good start here, carrying over the enthusiasm from Frankfurt and New York.&quot;</p>
<p>The 7.2 million share trade volume in Deutsche Telekom pulled in a close second to the most heavily traded domestic share on the first section of the Tokyo bourse, hotel operator Gajoen Kanko with about 7.3 million.</p>
<p>But the share's price, which climbed to end higher in other bourses, slipped to close lower in Tokyo as a post-launch buying spree seen on overseas bourses invited profit-taking in the Tokyo time zone.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom shares debuted on the foreign stocks section of the Tokyo bourse at 2,500 yen, but shed 60 yen to close at 2,440 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors who had bought in overseas markets sold off in Tokyo today, inflating the trade volume as a result,&quot; a broker at a second-tier brokerage said.</p>
<p>Brokers added that as the yen conversion of the Frankfurt closing share price was about 2,520 yen, some market participants, especially dealers, bought and prevented the price from falling past the 2,400 yen level.</p>
<p>&quot;This sort of price and volume movement is typical of newly listed foreign stocks in Japan,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The formerly state-owned firm's listing is the first by a U.S. or European company in Tokyo since 1993. Nearly five years ago the exchange prided itself on having 127 foreign issues, but low liquidity, huge costs and the strong yen against the dollar forced many to leave, TSE officials said.</p>
<p>So far this year, 11 firms have delisted, and after Exxon Corp goes in December, only 66 will be left.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue went public worldwide, which means that serious, big Japanese investors didn't necessarily have to buy in Tokyo,&quot; a &quot;Big Four&quot; broker said.</p>
<p>Some market sources warned that the nature of the shares cooled off investor sentiment in Tokyo and that the attention was unlikely to last for long.</p>
<p>&quot;The share is seen as a good investment as its dividend yield is high, not necessarily because its price is expected to grow,&quot; said Kokusai Securities strategist Kenzo Doi.</p>
<p>Some smaller brokerages said they had received few buy orders from customers as the stability of the share price was disappointing for investors seeking fast profits.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike domestic issues, Telekom prices will mirror the international market as well, and fluctuations could be muted,&quot; a foreign broker said.</p>
<p>The shares were first listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange priced at 28.5 marks ($19) in what was Europe's biggest ever flotation. They started trade on Monday at a 16.5 percent premium and closed at 33.90 marks, with about 38 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Trade on Wall Street was also heady, with the issue closing 14 percent higher at 2-39/64 above the $21-1/2 pricing and with million shares traded. ($1=112 yen, 1.50 marks)</p>
