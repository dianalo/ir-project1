<p>It's a Snip, bidding to become the ninth horse to win two years in succession in the 106-year history of the Pardubice steeplechase, leads a British raid to this city east of Prague on Sunday.</p>
<p>Last year's winner, one of a trio of British horses expected for the controversial four-and-a-quarter mile event (6.9 km), has the considerable advantage from the saddle of Richard Dunwoody, one of the world's most accomplished jump jockeys.</p>
<p>The Pardubice, a unique test of man and horse, includes a series of demanding obstacles and has been compared to the Grand National at Aintree, a race Dunwoody has won twice.</p>
<p>Race organisers have made the course easier in recent years, including modifying the daunting Taxis jump with its tough, high, wide fence and deep ditch. </p>
<p>This and various other changes among the other 30 jumps followed massive protests and the embarassing 1993 outcome when only one horse managed to finish.</p>
<p>A total of 21 horses have died in the Pardubice over the years.</p>
<p>Rounding out the trio of British challengers looking to win part of the 2.5 million crown ($92,000) purse are Irish Stamp and Veleda II.</p>
<p>Irish Stamp, to be ridden by Norman Williamson, has a clear chance and is rated considerably higher in England than It's a Snip, although the latter's proven ability over the course will be a major factor.</p>
<p>Of the others, Polish-trained Scater is also expected to make a bold show.</p>
<p>Despite its long history, the Pardubice has only recently regained its former status.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past everyone in Britain knew of the enormously difficult course but they didn't have much interest,&quot; said Nigel Miller, one of the organisers who has worked to bring the British contingent here.</p>
<p>&quot;But this year, one of the biggest hits of the season is to come here for a two-day trip to one of the most historic races around.&quot;</p>
