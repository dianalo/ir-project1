<title>USA: SEC yield-burning probe targets Orange County deal.</title>
<headline>SEC yield-burning probe targets Orange County deal.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA ANA, Calif. 1997-07-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has subpoenaed bond documents from Orange County, Calif., as part of the agency's sweeping yield-burning investigation, county officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>SEC investigators in Washington subpoenaed offering documents from the southern California county, seeking information about a 1994 refunding by the South Orange County Public Financing Authority.</p>
<p>Orange County officials said they sent the requested documents to the SEC. &quot;We have yet to hear anything further from the SEC,&quot; county public finance manager Tom Beckett said.  </p>
<p>Beckett said the SEC's yield-burning investigation appeared not to be related to the county's 1994 municipal bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>Orange County, one of the nation's richest, filed for bankruptcy protection in December 1994 after sustaining losses estimated at more than $1.6 billion on risky investments. The county emerged from bankruptcy one year ago.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy shocked Wall Street, and prompted both SEC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to launch investigations focusing on disclosure in county bond documents and on the way the county sized its note sales.  </p>
<p>The South Orange County Public Financing Authority's $239 million special tax revenue bonds, 1994 Series C, refunded eight outstanding community facilities district bonds, according to county officials.</p>
<p>The August 1994 deal was underwritten by PaineWebber Inc and Stone &amp; Youngberg LLC. Officials at both firms were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>The SEC subpoena was dated April 17, and was issued as part of the agency's broad investigation of yield burning, according to Orange County bond documents obtained by Reuters.  </p>
<p>Yield burning refers to allegations that bond underwriters overcharged states and localities in recent years for U.S. Treasury securities purchased to help refinance outstanding bonds. SEC officials have said that the agency has over 20 yield-burning probes underway across the country.</p>
<p>Orange County officials said it was not clear what impact the commission's investigation would have on the 1994 refunding bonds. If the SEC were to find that yield burning took place, the IRS could be drawn into the probe to determine whether the interest on the bonds should be taxable.</p>
<p>SEC officials were not immediately available to comment on the yield-burning probe. As a general rule, the SEC will neither confirm nor deny its investigations.</p>
