<p>France faces the dilemma of breaking its own laws or depriving French TV viewers of seeing next year's World Cup finals if it allows a U.S. brewer to advertise at the World Cup venues.</p>
<p>The Anheuser-Busch brewery has signed a contract with world soccer body FIFA worth about 100 million francs ($25 million) for the right to advertise its Budweiser beer in the 10 World Cup stadiums during the June 10-July 12 tournament next year.</p>
<p>But France's Evin Law prohibits the televised broadcasting in France of competitions held in stadiums where there are advertisements for alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>The advertisements themselves are not illegal but broadcasting them is.</p>
<p>&quot;A June 1994 amendment has made it legal to put up panels advertising alcoholic drinks at sporting venues,&quot; a spokeswoman for France's Sports ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;And a 1995 code of good conduct allows the broadcasting in France of events taking place abroad at venues where there are such panels,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is trying to find a way of resolving the problem by amending this code to include international events taking place in France.</p>
<p>&quot;They should reach a solution after the holidays, in September.&quot;</p>
<p>But if the problem is not resolved, France faces the possibility of the whole world being able to watch the sport's biggest showcase apart from the people of the country in which it is being played.</p>
<p>The French government, while under pressure from the powerful U.S. brewery to find a solution, must at the same time try to avoid antagonising local drinks producers by making exceptions only for foreign companies.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the World Cup organising committee said they could do nothing about the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not down to us. We just have to respect a French law that was there before we were created,&quot; he said.</p>
