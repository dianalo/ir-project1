<p>It started last year with just bad jokes.</p>
<p>But now, investors are not only railing against the U.S. Treasury's 10-year inflation-protected securities (TIPS), but many have started dumping them from their portfolios.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as inflation doesn't look like a problem, you would do better buying fixed (10-year notes) versus indexed ones,&quot; said Sam Kahan, chief economist and president of ASK Financial Research Ltd.  </p>
<p>Money market participants said numerous fixed-income funds sold blocks of the 10-year inflation-indexed securities earlier this week. They added that the amount perceived to have been sold ranged from $250 million to $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>Investors seem to be content with the view that inflation is not a problem, evidenced by a 0.3 percent decline in the May producer price index and just a scant 0.1 percent increase in the May consumer price index.</p>
<p>The low-inflation scenario combined with the Treasury's decision last week to do away with two regular 10-year note auctions led to a large rally in the nominal 10-year note.  </p>
<p>The buying spree brought yields on the issue down to 6.40 percent on Wednesday from near 7.0 percent in mid-April.</p>
<p>In contrast, the 10-year TIPS, which was sold at 3.65 percent on April 8, was at 3.64 percent late Wednesday. It was at 3.55 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Consequently, the spread between the nominal and 10-year TIPS has narrowed to its lowest level ever at 275 basis points from 333 basis points in late March.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless inflation picks up, there is risk to further spread widening and (TIPS) underperformance,&quot; said Hussein Malik, Treasury market strategist at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.  </p>
<p>&quot;The 10-year sector has outperformed the rest of the market as well, but still, (a narrowing of the spread by) 55 basis points is pretty extreme.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, traders said the lack of liquidity in the TIPS is a point of concern among players.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, for instance, GovPX trading volume in the 10-year TIPS was $62 million against the over $4.0 billion traded in regular 10-year notes.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is a limited audience who can trade and buy (TIPS),&quot; said Bill Kirby, co-head trader at Prudential Securities Inc. &quot;They are still not something the overall public is comfortable with.</p>
<p>&quot;No one knows how to hedge them. We are still going through the feeling out process,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Kirby and other players suspect that once the Treasury develops a TIPS yield curve, the inflation-linked securities might become more popular.</p>
<p>So far, Treasury has sold only 10-year TIPS.</p>
<p>The inaugural auction on January 29 for $7.0 billion brought in heavy demand and a lower than expected yield of 3.449 percent. The Treasury re-opened the issue and added $8.0 billion of the notes on April 8 with a 3.65 percent return over inflation. Demand was considerably lighter.</p>
<p>In July, Treasury will sell five-year TIPS and in 1998, Treasury will sell 30-year TIPS.</p>
<p>&quot;Once we get a curve, we will be able to put together something,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;Now, there's a limited audience.&quot;</p>
