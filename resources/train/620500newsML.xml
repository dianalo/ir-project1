<p>CBOT wheat futures closed mixed as the market found late support, mainly in the nearby contracts, on a surge in old crop soybeans, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat was struggling to stay even early and tumbled at one stage during trading, on fund long liquidation tied to improving conditions of the U.S. wheat crop.</p>
<p>&quot;The crop looks good and harvest is coming on,&quot; a trader said referring to bearish inputs for CBOT wheat futures.</p>
<p>USDA Tuesday said the U.S. winter wheat crop as of Sunday was rated 51 percent good to excellent, above the 50 percent in that category the previous week.</p>
<p>Traders said the crop should show another hike in conditions next week due to recent helpful rain in the Plains.</p>
<p>USDA Tuesday reported the U.S. spring wheat seeding at 83 percent complete as of Sunday, ahead of 65 percent a year ago and equal to the 83 percent average.</p>
<p>Friday's CFTC Commitments of Traders report showed wheat futures were vulnerable to more long liquidation. As of May 20, CFTC said funds in the wheat market were long by roughly 80 million bushels and short by about 74 million bushels.</p>
<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat closed 3-1/2 cents per bushel higher to four lower, with July up 3-1/2 at $3.67.  </p>
<p>LIT America sold six million bushels of July, FIMAT Futures sold 4.5 million July and Iowa Grain sold two million bushels of July, traders said. Funds sold an estimated 15.0 million bushels of wheat futures Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Cargill Inc bought three million bushels of July, Merrill Lynch Futures bought two million July and Cargill Investor Services bought 1.5 million bushels of July, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 27,000 contracts, above the 26,481 traded Tuesday.</p>
<p>In wheat options, FIMAT Futures sold 600 July $3.80 calls at five cents and sold 600 July $3.50 puts at four cents, traders said. Refco Inc bought 450 July $4.00 calls at 1-1/2 cents and sold 250 July $3.50 puts at 4-3/4 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat options volume was estimated by the CBOT at 9,000 contracts, below the 9,655 traded Tuesday.</p>
