<headline>Mercury Finance sued in class action - lawyers.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mercury Finance Co and some of senior officers are accused in a clsss action lawsuit of misrepresenting or omitting material information concerning Mercury's results for its 1994, 1995 and 1996 fiscal years, lawywers for the plaintiffs said Thursday.</p>
<p>Wolf Popper LLP and Miller Faucher Chertow Cafferty and Wexler said the suit filed on January 29 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was on behalf of purchasers of Mercury securities during the period January 30, 1994 through January 28, 1997.  </p>
<p>On January 29, Mercury said that 1996 net income would be restated to $56.7 million from $120.7 million, 1995 profits would be cut to $76.9 million from $98.9 million and 1994 earnings would be $83 million instead of the $86.5 million originally reported.</p>
<p>Mercury's previously disseminated financial statements materially misstated its financial condition and masked an alarming decline in operating results, the law firms said.</p>
<p>Mercury attributed the material misstatement of earnings and financial condition to unauthorized entries made by the company's principal accounting officer, James Doyle. Mercury said that Doyle has disappeared.</p>
<p>The law firms said that Doyle and Mercury chairman, president, and chief executive John Brincat, sold tens of thousands of shares of Mercury stock at inflated prices.</p>
<p>A Mercury spokesman was not immediately available to comment on the suit.</p>
<p>Trading of Mercury shares have been halted since before the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders early this morning said Mercury traded at 4-1/4 overseas, down from 14-7/8, the last NYSE trade in the share on January 28.</p>
