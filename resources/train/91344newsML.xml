<title>USA: Gang arrests tied to murder of rap star Shakur.</title>

<p>About a dozen suspected gang members were arrested on Wednesday for a series of shootings in southern California that may be linked to the murder of rap star Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas last month, police said.</p>
<p>ABC radio news reported that one of the men taken into custody was a suspect in Shakur's killing, but police declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>The man's mother told Los Angeles radio station KFWB that he was in Las Vegas the day of Shakur's murder but that he was not involved in it.</p>
<p>Police Capt. Steve Roller said the suspects arrested on Wednesday were all accused of crimes committed in Compton, a small town adjacent to downtown Los Angeles that has strong ties to the &quot;Gangsta&quot; rap movement.</p>
<p>But Roller said an investigation showed that some of the shootings &quot;may have been in retaliation&quot; for the attack on Shakur. Las Vegas detectives were in Compton to possibly interview the gang members taken into custody, he said.</p>
<p>Shakur was shot four times on Sept. 7 as he rode in a car with Death Row Records executive Marion &quot;Suge&quot; Knight after attending the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon heavyweight championship boxing match.</p>
<p>Police said the shots came from a white Cadillac that drew alongside Knight's BMW. Knight was only slightly injured, but Shakur died of his wounds six days later.</p>
<p>Roller said Compton police, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms made early morning raids on 37 locations armed with 19 arrest warrants.</p>
<p>He said the crimes involved 12 shootings and three killings and that some were a &quot;response&quot; to Shakur's murder. All occurred after Sept. 7 and involved a war between two rival street gangs, police said.</p>
<p>Shakur, whose best-selling &quot;Gangsta&quot; songs often mirrored his own troubled life, was free on $1.4 million bail at the time of his death after serving eight months in a New York prison for taking part in a sexual attack on a woman fan.</p>
<p>Shakur, who had the words &quot;Thug Life&quot; tattooed across his abdomen, was shot five times in 1994 during a robbery in the lobby of a Manhattan hotel.</p>
<p>Shakur, who recorded under the stage name 2Pac, burst onto the rap scene in 1991 with his best selling album, &quot;2Pacalypse Now,&quot; and went on to sell more than $90 million in albums.</p>
<p>He was also a fledgling actor carving out a second career on the big screen. He starred with Janet Jackson in the 1993 film, &quot;Poetic Justice,&quot; and had recently completed two other movies, playing a detective in &quot;Gang Related&quot; and a heroin addict in &quot;Gridlock.&quot;</p>
