<p>Lawrence Singleton, convicted in California of raping a teenage girl and chopping off her arms, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a charge of stabbing to death a prostitute in Florida.</p>
<p>Singleton, who served eight years in prison for the California attack and moved back to his Florida birthplace after his release, was arraigned on a charge of first-degree murder in the Feb. 19 killing of Roxanne Hayes, 31.</p>
<p>Police called to Singleton's home near Tampa found him blood-spattered and standing by the nude body of Hayes, who police said had 99 prior arrests, most for prostitution. She had been stabbed repeatedly in the chest.</p>
<p>Singleton, 69, denied killing Hayes to the first deputy on the scene, then said to reporters as he was led away: &quot;They framed me the first time but this time I did it.&quot;</p>
<p>Singleton, dressed in an orange jailhouse jump suit, slippers and a blue demin jacket, appeared subdued and looked down at his feet as assistant state attorney Lyann Goudie told Judge Bob Mitcham that Florida would seek the death penalty.</p>
<p>Singleton spoke only once, answering softly &quot;no sir&quot; when Mitcham asked him if he had ever used any other names.</p>
<p>Court records indicated Singleton had assets of $500 in cash and a $600-a-month pension.</p>
<p>Assistant public defender John Skye offered a plea of not guilty on behalf of his client and asked Mitcham to bar the state from attempting to subpoena psychiatric records from a local hospital that treated his client after a suicide attempt in early February, days before the killing.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Mr. Singleton currently under a suicide watch?&quot; Mitcham asked. When Goudie said no, Mitcham ordered her to &quot;look into that matter.&quot;</p>
<p>A hearing was set for March 18 on the motion to suppress psychiatric records. No trial date was set. Skye asked for time to assemble records from California.</p>
<p>Singleton served eight years of a 14-year California sentence for raping and mutilating Mary Vincent in 1978. When he was released on parole, no community in California would accept him and he spent a month after his release living on the grounds of San Quentin prison before moving to Florida.</p>
