<p>Britain's poor families using pre-payment metres pay more for gas than their wealthier counterparts under competition and the opportunities for them to shop around for gas are limited, industry groups said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The higher cost of supplying gas to households on pre-payment meters has encouraged new suppliers to &quot;cherry-pick&quot; more affluent customers who pay for gas by direct debit, leaving low-income families not only with higher gas bills but also with no choice of gas supplier, speakers told a seminar held by TransCo and the National Energy Action charity in London.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be mindful that those consumers that are the least vocal and the least organised tend to be the in lowest income groups. There is a lack of appreciation in the industry of the plight of these disadvantaged customers,&quot; said Martin O'Neill MP, Chairman of the Trade and Industry Select Committee.</p>
<p>The removal of cross-subsidies which existed in the old monopoly system under British Gas means that low-income consumers in the competitive market are charged as much as 34 percent more for their gas, said Sue Slipman, Director of the Gas Consumers Council.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the high costs of the current system and the lack of subsidies in the competitive market, we need to re-examine the value of (pre-payment meters)...We do not wish to see the elderly, vulnerable consumers picking up the tab,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>And discrimination against customers using pre-payment meters is set to worsen, with TransCo, which owns and operates meters, threatening to charge suppliers for some non-emergency call-out visits. Transco is the pipeline and transport arm of BG Plc.</p>
<p>As a result, there is little or no incentive for poorer families to switch away from Centrica, the supply arm of the newly demerged British Gas.</p>
<p>In Southwest England, the first region in Britain to be opened up to competition, just one percent of customers that switched away from Centrica used pre-payment meters. Sixty-two percent of the switchers were direct debit customers, said Ruth Evans, Director of the National Consumers Council.</p>
<p>Under the old British Gas monopoly pre-payment meters were seen as an effective means of managing debt and reducing disconnections among low income households.</p>
<p>When the so-called &quot;Quantum&quot; meters were introduced by British Gas, disconnections fell from 80,000 a year to 15,000.</p>
<p>But the new entrants to the market, such as the regional electricity companies, have genuine concerns about supplying pre-payment customers, speakers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Quantum meters are expensive, they are not geared up for competition, they are geared up for one supplier, and administration is difficult,&quot; said the GCC's Slipman.</p>
<p>Slipman called for action to encourage the new suppliers to take on low-income customers. This could include the introduction of lower cost pre-payment meters, or the development of schemes such as Fuel Direct in which fuel bills are paid directly from government benefits or pensions.</p>
<p>But if this doesn't work, the government and industry regulator Ofgas will have to consider a return to cross-subsidies, Slipman said.</p>
<p>&quot;If lower administration costs do not produce a socially acceptable price gap, we will need a subsidy for low-income consumers, either through a levy on the industry or through a direct, targeted state benefit,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Speakers noted that despite discrepancies in tariffs charged to different types of consumers, competition has brought lower prices to all.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas prices after VAT are 20 percent lower than before (competition), and not all the benefit is going to higher income customers...although low-income customers haven't got the same benefits as others so far&quot; said Malcolm Keay, Director of the Energy Policy and Analysis Unit at the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
<p>Two million households in Britain are now able to pick their gas supplier under the first two phases of the introduction of competition to the domestic sector, which will take full effect in 1998.</p>
<p>The first pilot area covering Devon, Cornwall and Somerset was opened to competition in April last year. The second pilot kicked off in Avon and Dorset on February 10 and was widened to cover Kent and East and West Sussex on March 7.</p>
