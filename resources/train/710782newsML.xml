<p>Mexico's elections on Sunday can be viewed as a sign that democracy is planting firm roots, and that perception should keep U.S. capital flowing south of the border, U.S. analysts said Monday.</p>
<p>Mexicans voted for change, handing the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) its first loss of a Congressional majority since 1929, but the stability of the electoral process has led U.S. economists to conclude that the United States and Mexico will move steadily toward closer integration.  </p>
<p>&quot;The results are undoubtably positive,&quot; said Jose Luis Daza, J.P. Morgan's emerging markets research head. &quot;Mexico is in a prolonged period of integration with the U.S. We will see very strong inflows of capital on a sustained basis.&quot;</p>
<p>With 80 percent of the votes counted in the lower house race, the PRI had garnered 38.23 percent of the vote, short of the 42.2 percent needed for a majority. The rightist National Action Party (PAN) had nabbed 27.31 percent and the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) 25.22 percent.  </p>
<p>In the race for Mexico City, a high-profile post previously named by Mexico's president, veteran PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas trounced his opponents.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term, the markets, particularly the Mexicans, are viewing this quite favorably,&quot; said Joe Petry, chief Latin America economist at Citicorp Securities.</p>
<p>Petry added that given that the election had little violence and was deemed free and fair, the financial markets expected the PRI would be able to work with the opposition.  </p>
<p>The poll results spoke to voter dissatisfaction with the PRI's hegemony over Mexican politics, as well as to anger at the government's handling of the 1995 financial collapse that plunged the country into recession.</p>
<p>But U.S. analysts said that Mexico would likely stick to its economic plan of greater liberalization and integration with its partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the United States and Canada.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the fact that the PRI has to share power or Cardenas will control Mexico City will bring back the process of Mexico closing itself off,&quot; said David Martinez, managing director of Fintech, an investment management company.</p>
<p>&quot;Direct foreign investment will continue to grow because of lower wages and direct access to the U.S. market,&quot; Martinez added.</p>
<p>Mexican equities should provide greater returns, based on the export sector and growing domestic consumer demand, than bonds, where the short-term Cetes bill had already posted a strong rally this year, U.S. analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There may be some more room in the equity markets. There are a lot of sectors that continue to improve,&quot; Petry said. &quot;Consumer sectors that have lagged still offer opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>Greater democratization should also spread the benefits of the country's economic reform, as the nation breaks loose of the patronage systems and corruption established during nearly seven decades of PRI rule, analysts said.</p>
<p>Mexican markets rallied in relief at the election's peaceable outcome. The peso rocketed 4.7 centavos to 7.8960/7.900 on the benchmark 48-hour contract. Overnight Cetes rates swooned by nearly 300 basis points to 17.76 percent. The bolsa broke yet another intraday record, jumping 1.033 percent, in the latest of a string of new highs.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan's Daza said the peso would likely continue to appreciate in real terms as foreign capital continues to flow into Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;The momentum at this stage looks pretty good for Mexico,&quot; Daza said. &quot;The economy will continue to grow. The country is moving well toward democracy, markets are responding well to events, the economy is very well balanced.&quot;</p>
