<p>Germany's DAX index surged on Wednesday to its seventh consecutive record closing high in bourse dealings, underpinned by the dollar rising to 1.76 marks in European dealings and higher German debt prices.</p>
<p>Dealers said they saw no signs the market would soon break its uptrend but warned that the advance may have to slow.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still very buoyant and there's no sign of the DAX giving up steam anytime soon,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;But we may need a brief pause and could face some profit-taking.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX ended up 49.46 points at 4,055.86 points, while the IBIS DAX was at the same level in post-bourse trade.  </p>
<p>Traders only last week were saying it may take a few weeks for the DAX to break 4,000 points. Several research houses were now targeting 4,100 points by the end of the week.</p>
<p>But some were sceptical, saying the advance must slow to head off profit-taking and for trading volumes to grow.</p>
<p>One weak spot was retailer Metro AG, in favour after saying it might buy a Dutch cash and carry firm.</p>
<p>But Metro chief executive Klaus Wiegandt told the group's annual general meeting in Cologne that expectations for Metro's shares was too high, triggering a sell-off from a new high of 228 marks to end the bourse down 7.40 marks at 209 marks.  </p>
<p>Dealers said analysts at several German and international research houses have recently recommended the Metro stock, including Goldman Sachs which raised its rating on Wednesday to &quot;outperform&quot;.</p>
<p>But top DAX shares were generally higher across the board as the banking, automobile and chemical sectors benefitted from the stronger dollar. Volkswagen AG rose 18 marks to 1,485 marks after saying it would shift production of its Golf estate wagons to Karmann GmbH through mid-1998 because its overall production capacity was limited due to strong demand for its models.  </p>
<p>BMW AG was also higher, rising 13 marks to 1,504 marks on prospects for export-driven companies, such as BMW, turning in higher profits due to the strong dollar.</p>
<p>Banking stocks were among the most-traded of the session, with Commerzbank AG advancing 1.50 marks to 52.20 marks, Deutsche Bank AG up 90 pfennigs at 104.40 marks and Dresdner Bank AG leading the pack by gaining 3.15 marks to 68.20 marks.</p>
