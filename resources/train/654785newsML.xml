<title>AUSTRALIA: Aborigine files against Australia uranium mine.</title>
<headline>Aborigine files against Australia uranium mine.</headline>

<p>A traditional Aboriginal land owners group in Australia's Northern Territory has launched a legal challenge to halt development of a uranium mine near the Kakadu National Park.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the Aborigines lodged documents in the Federal Court claiming the issuing of a mining lease in 1982 for the Jabiluka project, located 20 km north of the existing Ranger uranium mine, was not proper or legal, the Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corp said in a statement.</p>
<p>The claim was lodged on behalf of traditional owner Yvonne Margarula against Northern Territory and Federal governments.  </p>
<p>The claim alleges the Northern Territory government does not own the uranium and did not have the authority to issue a lease to mine uranium.</p>
<p>Uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd is seeking Federal government approval to build a uranium mine at Jabiluka, and is expected to hand a final environmental impact assessment to Environment Minister Robert Hill shortly, ERA's chief executive Phillip Shirvington told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;That's due to be given to the government shortly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the next day or two ERA was likely to announce an exact date for handing in the assessment, Shirvington said.  </p>
<p>The government then has a 42 days to consider the assessment, he said.</p>
<p>Shirvington said the project had the support of other traditional owners in the region of the mine and was willing to meet with Margarula.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is concerned a traditional owner feel the need to take legal action when the company has offered to meet her social concerns about the impact of mining and to follow all due processes necessary for the negotiations with traditional owners on Jabiluka,&quot; Shirvington said.  </p>
<p>Barring new delays, Shirvington said he expected approval for the mine in January or February, with production commencing in 2000.</p>
<p>Jabiluka and ERA's existing uranium mine, Ranger, are leases which lie within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park.</p>
<p>The possibility of developing Jabiluka was opened up in 1996 after Prime Minister John Howard abolished the three mines only policy of his predecessor Paul Keating, which limited uranium mining in Australia.</p>
<p>ERA is 68 percent owned by resources group North Ltd  </p>
