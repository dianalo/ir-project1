<p>Three North Koreans are seeking asylum in South Korea from a third country, a Seoul intelligence official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>State radio said the three were now in Hong Kong. The official at the Agency for National Security Planning identified them as relatives of a defector who came to Seoul last year, but he declined to give details of their whereabouts.  </p>
<p>&quot;Three North Koreans are waiting in a third country to come to South Korea,&quot; said the official, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>He said they were the mother and younger brother and sister of Hong Jin-hee, 28, who defected in January, 1996, and is now a student at Seoul's Korea University.</p>
<p>South Korea is awaiting the arrival of Pyongyang's highest-ranking defector, Hwang Jang-yop, who was flown to the Philippines last week from Beijing after almost five weeks sheltering at a South Korean mission.</p>
<p>A string of defections from North Korea in recent months has been prompted by food shortages and economic collapse in the impoverished nation.</p>
