<headline>INSIGHT -FTSE TO EDGE UP TO 5,030, VOLATILE LATER.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-14</dateline>

<p>A slow start on the London stock market could see the FTSE 100 index float near 5,030 then ease a little, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>But heightened tension later in the day may produce larger swings in the market as it tries to find direction and stave off a fall below 5,000, they added.</p>
<p>Some psychological damage was done on Wednesday when the FTSE dipped below 5,000 intra-day, and there is a chance that further instability will take the index to levels approaching 4,985.</p>
<p>By 0738 GMT, the FTSE was up 20.3 at 5,023.9.  </p>
<p>Conventional wisdom would indicate the market's recent volatility should mean it is entering a bear phase, but unless interest rates are set to rise further, there is a chance the FTSE can pull itself together and make another fling to higher levels, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is need of consolidation,&quot; said Richard Marshall, a director at Investment research of Cambridge Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;A four-month uptrend has been broken on the FTSE, but the advance/decline line (for the total market) has been picking up,&quot; he added implying investor attention is being drawn towards smaller capitalised stocks.  </p>
<p>Currency upheavals have forced investors to take profits in the equity market and as this happens, there is still a significant proportion of investors waiting to buy shares at lower levels -- and this is causing wild swings in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;This usually happens towards the end of a trend,&quot; said Marshall.</p>
<p>Wild swings may occur later in the day after the release of U.S. retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for July which economists forecast to have risen 0.2 percent. A figure very much larger than this will send then market down and a smaller figure should send it higher.</p>
