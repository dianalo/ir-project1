<p>Krupp Hoesch Stahl AG, part of the steel division of Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, said on Monday depressed European steel prices had put it in the red in 1996, and no improvement was in sight this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Intense competition on the European steel market, and ruinous prices, led Krupp Hoesch Stahl AG into the loss zone in 1996,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company said it would soon begin slashing costs, particularly for coking coal, which it may begin to import if its domestic supplier Ruhrkohle AG does not lower its prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Revenues were far below (our) production costs,&quot; it said. &quot;No improvement is in sight for 1997.&quot; No concrete figures or comparisons were immediately available.</p>
<p>Krupp Hoesch Stahl AG is the largest unit of the parent company's steel division, manufacturing &quot;long steel&quot; products such as I-beams. A spokesman said the division as a whole was still profitable due to healthy operations in stainless steel.</p>
<p>Krupp Hoesch Stahl said it had devised an &quot;optimisation plan&quot; to return to competitiveness by cutting costs in all possible areas, including coke and personnel.</p>
<p>The plan, which will be presented to the supervisory board on February 5, includes both investment and rationalisation measures, it said.</p>
<p>Krupp said it had been buying coke in recent years from Ruhrkohle AG at above-market prices, and that it was prepared to begin importing coke if Ruhrkohle did not cut its prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The solution of the problem of uncompetitive coke costs is of existential significance for the Dortmund facility,&quot; it said.</p>
