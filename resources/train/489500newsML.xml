<p>(Corrects headline from &quot;Hilton Head Island women's results.&quot;)</p>
<p>Top seed Martina Hingis picked up her sixth and most hard-earned singles title of 1997 Sunday, outdueling fourth-seeded Monica Seles in the final of the $926,250 Family Circle Magazine Cup.</p>
<p>Hingis, undefeated this year in 31 matches, beat Seles in the finals of a WTA Tour event for the second straight week, 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-5).</p>
<p>The Swiss 16-year-old rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the third-set tiebreak and received a first-prize payday of $150,000. Hingis dropped just three games in a straight-sets victory over Seles in the final of last week's Lipton Championships.</p>
<p>Hingis, the youngest number one player in women's tennis history, unseated Germany's Steffi Graf at the top of the WTA Tour rankings last Monday.</p>
<p>Seles, playing in only her second tournament of the year, suffered her third straight loss to Hingis, also having lost in the final of the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland last November.</p>
<p>&quot;If you are 5-2 down in the tiebreaker and you know you have to play against the wind, you just try to make her (Seles) do the mistakes,&quot; said Hingis. &quot;I just fought back and tried to move her around and make her tired. She just played much better, much more clever this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Seles was seeking her 39th career singles title and her first since the Nichirei International last September. She was making her Hilton Head debut after withdrawing from three previous Family Circles due to injuries.</p>
<p>&quot;I just wanted to go out there and take it a point at a time and go for my shots,&quot; said Seles. &quot;I did that most of the time, and in the key points I didn't do that.</p>
<p>&quot;I had some great points, and it was a great match, and it was a lot of fun to play. I really think I played more my game a little bit and attacked more, which in the past I didn't do.&quot;</p>
<p>Hingis was playing in her eighth successive final, dating back to last year. She has also won the Australian Open, the Sydney International, Pan Pacific Open, and the Open Gaz de France.</p>
