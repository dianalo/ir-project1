<p>Steve Forbes, the millionaire former presidential candidate, criticised Congress and the Clinton administration on Monday for offering a tax cut that he said was far too small.</p>
<p>The administration and the Republican Congress are working on a deal to balance the budget and cut taxes by $85 billion over five years.</p>
<p>&quot;That much-vaunted tax cut is less than 1 cent on the dollar. It should be five to eight times what they're proposing,&quot; Forbes said at a trade convention here.</p>
<p>&quot;They say they're balancing the budget,&quot; he added. &quot;The way they keep the books is an abomination.&quot;</p>
<p>Forbes, the publisher of the financial magazine bearing his name, criticised his own Republican Party and the Clinton White House for being adrift.</p>
<p>Although he has given no clear answer to whether he would run again for president in 2000, Forbes has continued to give speeches around the country. After making quick early gains in public opinion polls during the 1995 primary season, the often wooden Forbes faded and eventually quit the Republican contest won by Bob Dole.</p>
