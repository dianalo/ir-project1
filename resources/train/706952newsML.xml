<title>UK: Oil slips on profit-taking but no big dip seen yet.</title>
<headline>Oil slips on profit-taking but no big dip seen yet.</headline>

<p>World oil prices ticked lower on Friday, following through from Thursday's heavy slump as dealers took profits from gains early in the week.</p>
<p>Prices came under pressure as dealers gave the thumbs down to support from U.S. gasoline demand and saw brighter prospects for the resumption of Iraqi crude exports under the terms of the UN's food-for-oil deal.</p>
<p>North Sea Brent blend, the benchmark for international markets, closed 15 cents down at $18.07 a barrel after a 71 cent slide on Thursday.</p>
<p>But dealers said that oil prices showed no immediate sign of any further falls after Brent hit bottom in early June at $17.32 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the market has firm proof Iraq is exporting again prices won't move far off $18,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Dealers said heavy Nigerian demand over the next couple of months to plug a hole in domestic gasoline supplies would help keep European refineries busy.</p>
<p>Nigeria was forced last week to order the import of 33 petroleum product cargoes to end a fuel crisis in one of the world's biggest oil producing countries.</p>
<p>Helping keep a lid on prices are rising stocks of diesel and heating fuel in the United States, the world's biggest oil importer. Inventories rose by a hefty four million barrels last week to stand nearly 17 million barrels above year-ago levels, according to data released by the American Petroleum Institute (API) this week.</p>
<p>Distillate inventories usually rise during the northern hemisphere summer when demand for heating oil is at a minimum but dealers say a disappointing gasoline season has prompted refineries to start stockpiling ahead of time.</p>
<p>Dealers watching a regular dripfeed of news on the likely timing of renewed Iraqi exports now are awaiting presentation of a new aid distribution plan by Iraq to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>
<p>Iraq, which shipped some 660,000 bpd under the first phase of the plan, could export nearer a million barrels daily to meet its permitted $2 billion of sales in the second phase.</p>
<p>The UN accord's renewal took effect on June 8 but Baghdad delayed restarting exports because it was unhappy with the cumbersome plan for distributing food and medicine.</p>
