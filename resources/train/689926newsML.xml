<headline>Indian gilt prices rise on bank rate cut.</headline>

<p>Prices of Indian government securities rose on Thursday following a cut in a key bank rate by the central bank but dealers said the rise was checked by high call money rates.</p>
<p>They said prices rose on expectations of a fall in interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>A one percentage point cut on Wednesday in the rate the central bank lends to banks is seen leading to a fall in bank lending rates. The central bank also announced a one percentage point cut in the maximum interest payable on deposits with maturities of 30 days up to one year.</p>
<p>Bankers said they will consider cuts in their prime lending rates over the next few days after consulting their respective boards of directors.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices rose today in anticipation of a fall in interest rates in the near future,&quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank. &quot;Most banks are expected to announce cuts in both deposit and lending rates in the next few days.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said prices rose around 20-25 paise in actively traded securities and would have risen further but for the high call money rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Call money rates, being around 9-10 percent today, kept the price rise in check,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Otherwise prices would have risen further.&quot;</p>
<p>The 12.14 percent 2000 government of India stock rose to 101.64 rupees from Tuesday's 101 while the 13.05 percent 2007 improved to 102.50 from 102.40, dealers said.</p>
<p>The 12.59 percent 2004, auctioned by the central bank on Wednesday at par, started trading at 100.10 and rose to 100.30, dealers said.</p>
<p>Treasury bills maturing in September yielded 6.75-6.90 percent while April bills yielded 9.0 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>Call money ended at 9.25-9.75 percent, marginally down from opening quotes of 9.25-10.0 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said most of the day's trade was done between 9.25 and 9.75 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expect call money rates to ease to around 6.0 percent after the Reserve Bank of India repurchases securities worth 51 billion rupees on Saturday when it reverses a repo auction held on June 23.</p>
