<p>Closed-escrow sales of California detached homes jumped 17.6 percent during July from a year ago, according to a report released on Monday.</p>
<p>The California Association of REALTORS and Transamerica's MetroScan real estate service said in a report that median home prices increased during July from a year ago in 145 of more than 300 selected California cities and areas surveyed.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite rising mortgage interest rates earlier this year, the California housing market recovery continued during July,&quot; California Association of REALTORS President Rick Snyder said.  </p>
<p>Statewide, 504,500 existing, single-family detached homes closed escrow during July on a seasonally-adjusted, annualized basis, down 0.6 percent from a revised annualized rate of 503,570 homes sold in June. The July sales pace jumped 17.6 percent from the July 1995 annualized rate, when 425,690 homes were sold, according to the report.</p>
<p>The statewide median price of an existing, single-family detached home sold during July was $182,780, virtually unchanged from $182,820 in June. The July median price increased 1.4 percent from July 1995, when the median-priced home sold for $180,250, the report said.  </p>
<p>Fixed mortgage interest rates averaged 8.24 percent during July, down from an average of 8.32 percent in June, but up from 7.61 percent in July 1995.</p>
<p>Adjustable mortgage interest rates averaged 5.98 percent in July, up from 5.92 percent in June and 5.83 percent in July 1995, the report said.</p>
