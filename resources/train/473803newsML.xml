<headline>NCB says restructuring may include sale of HQ.</headline>

<p>Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) said on Thursday that restructuring steps it is considering include the possible sale of its main office in Tokyo.  </p>
<p>&quot;No formal decision has been made yet on whether to sell our main office, but such a sale is being considered as one of our possible restructuring measures,&quot; an NCB spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The spokesman added that the bank was considering many possible restructuring steps, but he stopped short of saying when the bank will make public the measures.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Kyodo news agency reported that NCB would unveil its restructuring plans in early April, including the sale of its main office in Tokyo. The plans also include integration of some of its branches in Tokyo, further job cuts and closure of its loss-making overseas branches, it said.</p>
<p>NCB could earn an estimated 100 billion yen by selling its main office and some of its branches, with the money going to help write off its hefty bad loans, Kyodo said.</p>
<p>NCB would be expected to lease back its headquarters, it said.</p>
<p>NCB has lagged behind other major Japanese banks in writing off its problem loans, and wants catch up in an attempt to regain the trust of the financial markets, Kyodo said.</p>
<p>It said NCB would put priority on writing off its problem loans in the fiscal year ending on March 31.</p>
<p>NCB may even post a loss in 1996/97 in order to carry out the write-offs, as long as it can maintain its capital adequacy ratio at above eight percent, it said.</p>
<p>NCB aims to raise the amount of monthly debentures it issues to above 50 billion yen by the autumn, Kyodo said.</p>
