<p>Japan's Finance Ministry said on Thursday it will ban Nikko Securities Investment Trust and Management Co, an affiliate of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, from establishing new trust funds for one month from June 2, a MOF statement said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is truly regrettable that such illegal acts were conducted at Nikko Securities Investment Trust and Management Co,&quot; Atsushi Nagano, director-general of MOF's securities bureau, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bureau has instructed the company to take appropriate steps to strengthen the management of its investments and to clarify responsibilities by reforming its administrative structure, in order to prevent such illegal acts, the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that the bureau will do its best to prevent such things from happening again so that the credibility of investment trust funds will not be damaged.  </p>
<p>Nikko Securities Investment Trust and Management has said that an in-house investigation confirmed it conducted illegal dealings in 1994 involving trading in foreign bonds at prices above their market prices.</p>
<p>In a statement issued following MOF's decision to take punitive action, the company said it will do its best to prevent such illegal actions from recurring.</p>
<p>&quot;We view with seriousness the fact that the dealings violated the law. We keenly feel responsibility for the deed and we are reflecting deeply on it,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The company is five-percent owned by Nikko Securities.</p>
