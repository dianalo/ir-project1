<p>Turkey's state oil refinery Tupras, which reported a sharp rise in losses in its Q1 results, cannot sustain its existence unless the government adopts a proposed key law to rescue it, Energy Minister Recai Kutan said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have prepared the law to eliminate tax burdens on refineries and enable them to adopt a retail pricing system just like in Western countries,&quot; Kutan told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless the law is put into practice, Tupras cannot sustain its activities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tupras, which runs three refineries in Turkey and controls 86 percent of the market, reported on Monday a loss of 26.9 trillion lira in the first three months of 1997, up sharply from 1.8 trillion lira in the same 1996 period.</p>
<p>Officials say its losses are largely due to the pricing system used in Turkey, which requires refineries to pay taxes amounting up to 180 percent in total.</p>
<p>&quot;But the treasury has some fair objections to the new law,&quot; Kutan said.</p>
<p>The financial burden to be created by taking losses off Tupras will likely be borne by the treasury, already cash-strapped due to heavy domestic and foreign debt servicing.</p>
<p>The government has prepared a draft law to adopt a automated pricing system (OFM), designed to end losses of refinery companies -- Tupras and Atas, mainly owned by the Mobil/BP partnership.</p>
<p>The OFM is a mechanism which adjusts retail sale prices of petroleum products, taking its base on the Mediterranean benchmark prices set by Platt's Oilgram index.</p>
<p>According to the OFM, a fixed tax instead of the current four tax items that refineries are required to pay will be determined on the basis of either of lira per tonne, dollar per tonne or ECU per tonne.</p>
<p>The scheme will not tolerate local petrol prices fluctuate outside an allowed band, controlled by the government.</p>
<p>Atas, citing losses of $55 million for 1996, closed its main operation in October and has since continued to carry out an intermittent, minimal production with purposes of storing.</p>
<p>Officials have said the privatisation of Tupras, one the government's favourite companies to sell off to bring money to the ailing economy, depends on turning it to a money maker from the loss-making status.</p>
