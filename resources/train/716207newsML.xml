<headline>Mexican says he was on vacation, not kidnapped.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>The heir to one of Mexico's most controversial political dynasties, allegedly kidnapped by a clandestine group of peasant activists last week, reappeared on Tuesday, insisting he had only been to Europe on vacation.</p>
<p>Newspapers said Ruben Figueroa Smutny, 30, was ambushed last week in a Mexico City suburb in what they called an attack by members of PROCUP, an outlawed radical party believed to have links with Mexico's Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR).</p>
<p>But Figueroa denied any attack had taken place and said no ransom had been paid to anyone.</p>
<p>Reporters called to a news conference in the cobblestoned suburb of Coyoacan said Figueroa looked red-eyed and exhausted when he faced the news media.</p>
<p>He declined to identify the country or countries he had visited, saying only that he had travelled to Europe. He did not produce any air tickets as proof.</p>
<p>Figueroa's father, Ruben Figueroa Alocer, a former governor of the troubled southern state of Guerrero who resigned in disgrace last year, denied reports that his son had been captured and said he was vacationing abroad.</p>
<p>But his mother, the family lawyer and a number of friends confirmed the kidnapping took place.</p>
<p>In Mexico families often deny such incidents to prevent police intervention and to discourage further kidnap attempts.</p>
<p>Figueroa's father is head of a dynasty that has long been among Mexico's most powerful. He stepped down as governor in 1996 after being accused of playing a role in the massacre of 17 peasants in Guerrero in June 1995.</p>
<p>An attempted coverup by means of a videotape fabricated to prove the police had acted in self-defence caused an outcry after national television broadcast footage showing police placing weapons in the dead peasants' hands.</p>
<p>Figueroa's grandfather, Ruben Figueroa Figueroa, also a former Guerrero governor, was kidnapped by an earlier guerrilla organisation, Lucio Cabanas' Party of the Poor.</p>
