<text>
<p>ARA bunkers were slightly weaker on Thursday with the lacklustre state of the high sulphur barge market weighing on prices, brokers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST was put at $94/$96 fob against $96/$97 fob and 180 CST material, which remains in tight supply, was quoted around $102/$104.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand's pretty healthy,&quot; said one broker. &quot;I think the dead barge market is holding prices down.&quot;</p>
<p>Hamburg prices played catch-up with Rotterdam with 380 CST put at $99/$100 - some $3 lower than Wednesday. &quot;It's not to busy but we're picking up bits and bobs,&quot; said a local broker.</p>
<p>Mediterranean bunkers were static with 380 CST in Algeciras quoted at $102/$104 and in Augusta at $109/$111.</p>
<p>In Piraeus, demand was average and prices were steady at $102/$104 for 380 CST and $109/$111 for $180.</p>
<p>In Durban, prices were also unchanged with 180 CST quoted at $96 to $98 and diesel put at $215/$216.</p>
