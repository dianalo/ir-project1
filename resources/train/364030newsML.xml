<p>Outlook for Finnish financial markets next week according to economists, analysts and dealers:</p>
<p>*Nokia's full-year 1996 earnings and Wall Street key for overall stock market sentiment, several other large domestic companies will publish 1996 earnings,</p>
<p>*Markka seen supported by rising dollar vs mark, markka trading volumes not expected to pick up in near term,</p>
<p>*2004 bond and T-bills seen attractive in auctions. FOCUS ON NOKIA'S EARNINGS AND U.S. STOCKS</p>
<p>Nokia's 1996 earnings and the performance of Wall Street shares will play important roles for the overall sentiment on the Finnish bourse, analysts said.</p>
<p>Several other Finnish companies will publish full-year 1996 reports and market operators expect to be busy.</p>
<p>Martti Larjo, analyst at Merita Securities, said the profitability of Nokia's mobile phones division is expected to have picked up in H2 from H1. He saw an operating profit of slightly less than one billion markka for the division in H2.</p>
<p>Nokia's 1996 report (median profit forecast 3,851 million markka) is due on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jukka Huuskonen, chief analyst at Arctos Securities, said Merita's report would be of interest as it is expected to give clues how banks are performing in an environment of robust domestic economic growth.</p>
<p>Merita's results (median profit forecast 1,273 million markka) are due on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Also reporting next week are Metsa-Serla, Huhtamaki, Silja, Kesko, Raisio, Rautaruukki, TT Tieto, Amulehti and Nokian Renkaat. MARKKA SEEN SUPPORTED BY DOLLAR/MARK GAINS</p>
<p>The rise of the dollar against the German mark is expected to support the markka next week, senior forex dealers said.</p>
<p>One chief dealer saw DEM/FIM in a 2.950-2.975 range, while another chief dealer plotted a 2.94-2.98 range.</p>
<p>On Friday, U.S. January producer prices are due at 1530/1330 GMT while industrial production and capacity utilisation will be released at 1615/1415 GMT. FINNISH 1996 GDP DUE THURSDAY, JANUARY CPI FRIDAY</p>
<p>On Thursday, preliminary Finnish 1996 GDP data will be published at a Statistics Finland  news conference at 1000/0800 GMT.</p>
<p>On Friday, January CPI and construction costs are due at 0700/0500 GMT.</p>
<p>Postipankki's chief economist Tarja Heinonen forecast a rise in CPI of 0.3 percent month-on-month and 0.9 percent year-on-year. According to economists and analysts, domestic economic data are expected to be largely ignored by the markets. GOOD DEMAND FOR 2004 BOND AND T-BILLS SEEN IN AUCTIONS</p>
<p>&quot;Demand (for the 2004 bond) is expected to be good,&quot; said Matti Hannuksela, head of money market and bond trading at OKOBANK, adding that markka bonds looked attractive due to the steep yield curve.</p>
<p>The State Treasury Office will auction 9.50-percent 2004 bonds on Thursday.</p>
<p>T-bill maturities to be auctioned by STO at the regular weekly auction on Tuesday are 91-days, 183-days and 365-days.</p>
