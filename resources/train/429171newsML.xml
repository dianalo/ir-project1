<title>JAPAN: Internet father worries about offspring.</title>

<p>He could be called one of the fathers of the Internet in Japan but Koichi Suzuki isn't sure whether the new communications tool is a good fit for the Japanese.</p>
<p>Suzuki and his partners set up Internet Initiative Japan Inc. in 1992, the country's first Internet service provider, and at that time the Internet was a fairly radical concept.</p>
<p>Suzuki, now president and chief executive officer of IIJ, had to do battle for more than a year with Japan's mighty Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to win approval to operate in Japan's highly regulated telecommunications system.</p>
<p>IIJ is now the largest Internet service provider in the country and it has built a strong communications backbone within Japan and is forging strong links to the United States and to other Asian countries.</p>
<p>But it was not given a lot of hope when it first started up. Suzuki said he had to invest heavily with his own money after not getting any support from big name Japanese investors. Ironically he got more of his investment from offshore where the Internet was not seen as such a novelty.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people couldn't understand why we started IIJ,&quot; Suzuki recalled in an interview.</p>
<p>In a country of consensus that does not seem to produce folkloric business types such as Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates or Intel Corp. Chairman Andy Grove, Suzuki certainly seems to stand out.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Suzuki -- by his own admission -- employs more of a Western style decision-making process where he leads from the top rather than waiting for the traditional consensus to gel around an idea or direction for a company.</p>
<p>And at first glance it would appear that despite Suzuki's efforts, consensus has not been reached on the usefulness of the Internet in Japan. While many countries are making great strides on the Net, even in many other Asian countries, the land of the rising sun seems slow to awake to the new medium.</p>
<p>&quot;The Internet does not fit so well with the Japanese people,&quot; Suzuki said.</p>
<p>He said Japanese tend to work best together in groups and so perhaps the solitary experience of surfing the Web to see the world is a more difficult concept for many in Japan. The cost is also high as the Japanese do not have the luxury of flat rate phone calls.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most observers believe the Net is now probably in for a major expansion here.</p>
<p>Takahiko Umeyama, an analyst with International Data Corp. in Tokyo, said strong sales of personal computers into the home and office could be a precursor of greater Internet use.</p>
<p>While Japan has been a leader in electronic goods for many years, the use of personal computers has been trailing other Western countries. Introduction of Windows 95 by Microsoft has ignited the market, however, and sales of PCs soared nearly 40 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>IDC, meanwhile, is forecasting that the number of Internet users will jump from 5.3 million in 1996 to 10.8 million in 1997 and to 18.6 million in 1998.</p>
<p>A slew of new products from Japan's huge computer industry could reinforce the growing consensus that the Internet is the place to be.</p>
<p>Toshiba Corp., in just one example, will introduce in April in Japan a pocket size, pen-based communicator called the Genio that will connect with the PHS wireless phone system to allow browsing on the World Wide Web as all as host of other fax and organisational functions.</p>
<p>But even if the Net does finally explode here, Suzuki over at IIJ is somewhat wary, despite the fact his company would prosper in any upswing.</p>
<p>He would like to see Japan develop a strong base on the Net and build good connections to other Asian countries. He is wary of too much access just with the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Internet is not just a communications tool; it is also used to access culture. If Internet destroys culture it is not good for me,&quot; he said.</p>
