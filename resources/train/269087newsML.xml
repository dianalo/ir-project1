<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were quoted mixed on Friday, with dealers saying a government stock issue which closed on Thursday was not likely to have much impact on the system.</p>
<p>They said the seven year issue, through which government had hoped to raise over Z$1 billion, was ill-received because most players felt the 15.50 percent yield was too low. On Friday most players were seeking to off-load all the excess money they had stashed for the stock issue by way of purchasing treasury bills.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very active. People have lots of money and they want to buy treausury bills,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Discount houses were trading treasury bills at 17.85 percent after the tender rate remained unchanged at 18.07 percent at Thursday's weekly auction.</p>
<p>NCD bills maturing after 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought and sold firmer at 19.50 and 18.25 percent respectively from 19 and 18 percent while bankers acceptance bills continued steady at 18.25 percent (buying) but were firmer at 17.75 percent from 17.50 percent (selling).</p>
<p>Call money was unchanged at Thursday's 18 percent, with central Reserve Bank figures indicating an opening market surplus of Z$432 million.</p>
