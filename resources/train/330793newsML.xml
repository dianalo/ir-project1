<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright vowed on Friday to &quot;tell it like it is&quot; to China on human rights issues and the future of Hong Kong, but said U.S.-Chinese relations could not be held hostage to any one issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I will tell it like it is on the human rights issues and on Hong Kong to the Chinese when I meet with them,&quot; she said at her first news conference since being sworn in as Warren Christopher's successor on Thursday.</p>
<p>Referring to the many issues in the U.S.-China relationship, Albright said: &quot;It cannot be held hostage to any one issue.&quot; She cited what she called China's positive dealings with the United States on North Korea and Cambodia.</p>
<p>&quot;But there are some on which we differ - and human rights is one of them,&quot; she said. &quot;So we have made it clear that... what happens with Hong Kong is very important to the overall relationship.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Clinton administration voiced concern over what it called Chinese attempts to water down civil liberties in Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese control at midnight on June 30 after one and half centuries of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the important point here is that we understand the importance of Hong Kong as it reverts to China,&quot; she said, noting that Washington would watch to see if it was done &quot;in a way where the civil and human rights of the people who live in Hong Kong are respected.&quot;</p>
<p>She said she discussed Hong Kong earlier in the day with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind &quot;as one of the issues that we would have to address ourselves to.&quot;</p>
