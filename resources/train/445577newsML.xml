<p>Eli Duro slumps in the twilight of a waterfront hotel bar, nursing an Italian beer and musing aloud on the &quot;time of the pyramids&quot;. Suddenly a muffled explosion breaks his narrative.</p>
<p>The bar's plate glass windows buckle visibly and rattle in their frames. Residents of the port city of Vlore are fishing Albanian style by tossing hand grenades into the harbour.</p>
<p>Eli, who works at the hotel, complains that the kitchen freezer is full of fish forced on him by hooligans who have too much to carry away.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the 'time of the pyramids' our only guests have been foreign journalists,&quot; Eli explained.</p>
<p>&quot;I try to persuade them to eat them but we don't have a cook any more and anybody who wants a fish has to cook it himself. Most of the journalists prefer to make pasta.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;time of the pyramids&quot; refers to the recent era when ordinary people thought they could get rich overnight by investing in local pyramid schemes promising stupendous returns.</p>
<p>Suspicious at first, Eli, 20, finally succumbed two months ago and invested $9,000 in Vlore's local pyramid plan, known as &quot;Gjallica&quot;.</p>
<p>The money represented not only his savings from two years of work as a labourer and waiter in Greece, but most of the proceeds from the sale of his parents' home as well.</p>
<p>&quot;With the money we had left my parents and brother and sister and I moved from our little village here to Vlore where we rented a house. None of us had a job but that wasn't a worry since we were going to be rich,&quot; Eli said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then one day all the members of the Albanian parliament showed up in town and wanted their money back from Gjallica, and of course they got it. The next day Gjallica closed its doors and that was the end for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Albanian families were bankrupted by the collapse of nine pyramid schemes. Wealthier southern Albania, where people had money to invest, was hardest hit.</p>
<p>Blaming President Sali Berisha for their troubles, southerners rebelled and drove out the army and the secret police. Civil order disappeared. Weapons depots, banks, food stores and factories were looted and burned.</p>
<p>With the naming of a new prime minister last week the government just managed to maintain control over the north.</p>
<p>Berisha last week bowed to longstanding opposition demands for an all-party government and fresh elections and widespread unrest appears to have calmed after an enhanced police presence in Tirana and other towns.</p>
<p>But he has defied demands by the rebels -- and increasing suggestions from Western dignitaries -- to step down.</p>
<p>Many young Albanians like Eli couldn't care less. Talk about politics or revenge bores them. They want out.</p>
<p>&quot;As for me, I will get to Italy or Greece. I am young and I can make money again,&quot; Eli explained. &quot;But I worry about my family. There is no future here. What will they do? They have no money, they no longer own a home.&quot;</p>
<p>The conversation is interrupted by long bursts of automatic gunfire ripping through the night.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten days ago the sound of that shooting was music to my ears. Now I'm sick of it. Everything is in the hands of the mafia,&quot; Eli said.</p>
<p>&quot;In my home village the chief of police is a convict, a man who just escaped from jail. It's horrible. These people are criminals and they are destroying everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Army and state security forces are nowhere to be seen in Vlore. Real power, as in most of the south, resides with clan-based mafia organisations which have long smuggled drugs, arms and people from Albania into Europe, especially Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking back on the time of the pyramids it seems foolish to have lost all our money,&quot; Eli said.</p>
<p>&quot;But we Albanians were not the only ones. In the time of the pyramids this hotel was completely full of Italians who lived here and made investments also. Now they are gone. The hotel is almost empty and the town is destroyed.&quot;</p>
