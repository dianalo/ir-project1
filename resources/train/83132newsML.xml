<p>U.S. and European Union trade chiefs said Saturday they had reached a deal to break a logjam on an information technology agreement that both sides said they would like to see launched at a high-level meeting of the World Trade Organization later this year.</p>
<p>European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told a news conference they had struck a deal that would allow talks to begin among the major trading partners on what products should be covered by a global information technology accord.</p>
<p>Brittan said the deal, which calls for postponing a January meeting of the U.S.-Japan semiconductor industry council until at least March, &quot;broke the logjam&quot; that was holding up the ITA.  </p>
<p>Brittan said negotiations on the ITA would begin next week in Geneva.</p>
<p>&quot;We couldn't start negotiations until the roadblocks had been removed,&quot; Brittan said at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of trade ministers from the European Union, United States, Japan and Canada, the so-called Quadrilateral (Quad).</p>
<p>In a statement, the Quad members said that the first meeting of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Council, agreed to in July, would be delayed until March to allow time for WTO members to agree to the global agreement to eliminate tariffs on a wide range of information technologies by 2000.</p>
<p>U.S. trade officials had hoped the ITA could be launched at the first meeting of WTO trade ministers in Singapore in December.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a market access agreement worth tens of billins of dollars to the Quad countries alone,&quot; Barshefsky said.  </p>
<p>If efforts to achieve a global ITA fail, then the U.S., Japan semiconductor council will meet as planned. But a successful conclusion of the ITA will open the door to European participation in the U.S., Japan arrangement, trade officials said.</p>
<p>In an effort to break another logjam in an other area, the Barshefsky and Brittan said they would improve their market opening offers in telecommunications.</p>
<p>The Quad members said in a statement that the desire is to provide leadership for other countries to improve their offers as well and complete negotiations by a February 15 deadline.</p>
<p>Global telecommunciation talks stalled earlier this year after the United States complained that other countries had not sufficiently improved their offers.</p>
