<p>Bulgaria's population is expected to fall by one million to about seven million by 2020 as a low birth rate, economic crisis and high emigration take their toll, the National Statistics Institute said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend for a fall in the population is exceeding even the most pessimistic forecasts,&quot; the Institute's deputy head Kiril Gatev told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said the death rate far outstripped the birth rate and by 2020 every fourth Bulgarian would be a pensioner.</p>
<p>Bulgaria's population of 8.3 million at the end of 1996 is expected to fall to some 8.1 million by the year 2000 and to between 6.9 million and 7.4 million in 2020, Gatev said.</p>
<p>The birth rate fell to 8.6 per 1000 in 1996 from 12.1 per 1000 in 1990 against a death rate of 14 per 1000 in 1996.</p>
<p>Some 650,000 mostly young people left the impoverished, formerly communist country between 1989 and 1996, looking for a better life abroad, the Institute's figures show.</p>
<p>In 1989, some 218,000 ethnic Turks left for neighbouring Turkey after the then-communist regime banned them from using Moslem names and practising their religion, although many of them later returned.</p>
<p>In 1996 some 66,000 Bulgarians emigrated compared to 54,000 the previous year, mainly educated young people looking for a better future in countries such as Germany, Austria, the United States, Canada and South Africa, Gatev said.</p>
