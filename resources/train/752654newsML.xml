<headline>Argentine bonds rise, lifted by Ecuador rating.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-07-24</dateline>

<p>Argentine bonds closed much higher Thursday, helped by U.S. Treasuries and a credit rating of Ecuadorean debt by Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was very firm. It was helped by short-covering in the afternoon,&quot; said a trader at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 rose 3/8 to 95-1/8 while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 4 due 2002 rose $0.50 to 119.5.</p>
<p>News from Moody's that it had assigned a B1 credit rating on Ecuador's foreign-currency debt boosted the local market.</p>
<p>The news was uplifting in that by putting Ecuador on the same level as Argentina and Brazil, it led some to speculate that Argentina will get an upgrade from Moody's.</p>
<p>&quot;One could think&quot; this would lead to an Argentine upgrade, said the trader. &quot;It is one conclusion to draw from the news,&quot; he said, pointing to the fact that many consider Argentina's economic fundamentals much stronger than Ecuador's.</p>
<p>Another trader reported that he saw some big buying by U.S. funds of FRB bonds this session, testifying to the fact that there are investors who see lot more value in the Argentine market.</p>
<p>In the money markets, three-month peso BAIBOR rates rose to 7.1/8 percent from 7.0 percent.</p>
