<p>The Philippine armed forces is studying a Russian offer of a fleet of MiG-29 aircraft to help modernise the country's ill-equipped air force, military sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>If the government takes up the offer, it will most likely include a countertrade arrangement under which part of the payment will be in the form of commodities, said a senior officer, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>A Russian diplomatic source said representatives from Moscow Aviation Production Organisation (Mapo) were expected to visit the Philippines in the next few weeks to discuss the proposal.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary Renato de Villa told Reuters last month the Philippines planned to spend about $2 billion over the next five years to modernise the defence forces with more fighter planes and patrol ships.</p>
<p>The five-year weapons acquisition plan is the first phase of a 15-year military modernisation programme which would cost a total of $12 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is trying to offer the Philippines something for modernisation,&quot; the Russian source said. He said he did not have details of the offer for MiG-29s.</p>
<p>Philipine armed forces chief General Arnulfo Acedera and senior officers for planning and logistics visited Russia last August and were shown several of the fighters.</p>
<p>The Philippine air force temporarily grounded its fleet of 10 ageing F-5 fighter jets in January after one of the aircraft nose-dived into a river bank, killing two people, including its pilot.</p>
<p>Investigators said the crash was apparently caused by mechanical failure.</p>
<p>Most of the country's fighter jets were acquired from the United States in the 1960s.</p>
