<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said on Sunday the central bank is under no pressure to change its current &quot;steady hand&quot; monetary policy.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after a Group of Seven meeting, Tietmeyer said:  &quot;I do not see any room for a change in interest rates, either for a reduction or for an increase.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank chief noted that German interest rates are already at historic low levels and that any further easing of monetary policy might be inflationary.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer's remarks come at a time when the German economy is starting to show signs of life after turning in growth of only 1.4 percent last year. Bonn is banking on faster economic expansion to qualify for European monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has left its discount and Lombard interest rates unchanges for a year at 2.50 and 4.50 percent respectively while its key money market rate, the repo, has been left unchanged at three percent since August.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer's remarks followed an upbeat assessement on the economy from Finance Minister Theo Waigel who said that German economic conditions are favorable with inflation and interest rates low at the same time that foreign trade is picking up.</p>
<p>One of the keys to Germany's economic recovery is the strength of the mark.</p>
<p>The German currency fell to its lowest level since February 1994 at 1.7372 to the dollar in early Tokyo trading on Monday -- a level favoring exporters and at the same time raising fears of higher German inflation.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said he was opposed to any weakening of the German currency and that the central bank would try to keep the mark from continuing its downward trend.</p>
<p>A weak mark can push German inflation higher because more marks are needed to pay for imported goods such as energy, which is often priced in dollars.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said currency market rates now &quot;more or less&quot; reflect economic fundamentals and that he could not &quot;go along&quot; with a recent forecast that the mark could fall to a yearly average of 1.80 against the dollar.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's reluctance to prime the ecomoic pump comes at a crucial time for Germany with Waigel hoping for economic growth of 2.5 percent this year, a rate he figures will enable Bonn to trim its budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) -- the level needed to qualify for EMU.</p>
<p>In 1996 the German budget deficit stood at 3.8 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Although many private economists believe Germany will fail to meet that goal, Waigel said here that he remained confident in his forecast of a 2.9 percent deficit ratio in 1997, promising further budget steps if the target is endangered.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer indicated there was little he could do for Germany's other major economic problem -- unemployment.</p>
<p>With 4.3 million out of work, German joblessness is at its highest levels since World War Two.</p>
<p>The German central bank chief quoted International Monetary Fund managing director, Michael Camdessus as telling today's G7 meeting that there was little that monetary policy could do to solve Europe's unemployment problems.</p>
