<p>Israeli shares ended a new year's winning streak, closing lower in what traders described as a technical correction to an 8.9 percent rise over five sessions.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv stock exchange's benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 0.97 percent, or 2.24 points, to 227.60 on all-share turnover of 133 million shekels against 172 million shekels on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 1.10 percent lower at 235.59.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks healthy. After a very sharp rise the long awaited correction finally came. During the last three months the market rocketed and now it's time to take profits,&quot; said Michael Weiss at Evergreen Capital Markets who added that the immediate outlook was unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;The correction is very good for the market. If nothing dramatic happens on Wall Street the market will continue to rise soon,&quot; said Danni Scharia at Capital Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite today's decline the market was mixed and activity continued to be relatively high. The market is also affected by the fact that mutual funds specialising in small-capitalisation stocks returned to buying,&quot; Scharia added.</p>
<p>The most active share was Israel Chemicals, which gained 0.5 percent to 316 agorot on turnover of 6.2 million shekels.</p>
<p>The second active share was Africa Israel Investments, which plunged 29 percent to 201,159 agorot on volume of 6.1 million shekels.</p>
<p>Africa was traded today for the first time without its insurance business. On Sunday, shareholders will receive shares in Leumi Insurance Holdings. The distribution is part of a multi-faceted transaction under which Italian insurer Generali is buying control of Leumi Insurance.</p>
<p>Africa's 01 issue dropped 23 percent to 23,357 agorot.</p>
<p>Koor Industries, fell 1.75 percent to 19,951 agorot on turnover of 5.0 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.25 shekels)</p>
