<p>Swiss environmentalists suffered a setback on Tuesday when the interior ministry rejected their demand to block imports of foods containing genetically altered products.</p>
<p>In recent months consumer groups and government bureaucrats have wrangled over use of genetically altered products in a common ingredient, soy lecithin. Opponents fear manipulated products pose a health risk.</p>
<p>Chocosuisse, the Swiss chocolate producers' association, complained that the latest uproar was an example of ever tougher conditions confronting the domestic industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The terrain upon which local chocolate producers are forced to operate is like a minefield,&quot; said Chocosuisse.</p>
<p>Producers are not likely to drop the lecithin, although they are making every effort to keep domestic products free of altered soy, which is widely used outside of Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no chocolate without lecithin. It is an emulsifier which is used in production to bind fat with the sugar. Emulsifier is in every chocolate, and 99 percent of this lecithin is from soy,&quot; said a Chocosuisse spokesman.</p>
<p>Chocosuisse warned that if the climate did not become friendlier for Swiss chocolatiers, they might have no choice but to move some production outside the country.</p>
<p>The government's decision was bittersweet for consumer groups and the industry. Groups opposed to the use of gene-altered soy now plan to ask the highest Swiss court to block the imports.</p>
<p>Kraft Jacobs Suchard recalled 500 tonnes of chocolate bars from the Swiss market which it thought might contain gene-altered soy lecithin. The recall was of &quot;Toblerone&quot; bars, triangular shaped to resemble the Matterhorn Alpine peak.</p>
<p>In the case of Kraft Jacobs Suchard, a unit of U.S. food group Philip Morris Inc, the mix-up was an accident. &quot;It was never our intention to use it. We have publicly stated that we want to use unmodified products as long as they are on the market,&quot; said Suchard (Schweiz) President Walter Anderau.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman at the firm said the government's decision on Tuesday would not change its plans to recall the chocolate.</p>
<p>&quot;We still stick by our decision to recall our products,&quot; she said, From now on, the company would also seek to have its raw materials independently verified as being free of altered soy rather than relying on the supplier.</p>
<p>Producers complain that it is increasingly difficult and expensive to ensure that chocolates meet Swiss gene standards. They argue that gene-altered soy is already in wide use elsewhere, including in the United States, and in many parts of Europe.</p>
