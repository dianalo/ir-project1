<headline>Toronto stocks end down after triple witching.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toronto stocks fell slightly on Friday as quarterly triple-witching -- the expiry of futures, options, and options on futures -- kept trading volatile, traders said.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index fell 1.28 points to 6511.43 in brisk dealings of 88.4 million shares worth C$1.43 billion ($1.02 billion).</p>
<p>Nine of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes rose, but the important gold sector fell 2.82 percent. Gold futures prices on Comex fell $3 an ounce for August contracts.</p>
<p>Declining stocks led advances 454 to 506, with 88 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>Hot stocks included Cineplex Odeon Corp., which confirmed on Friday that it was in merger talks with Loews Theaters Group, a unit of Sony Corp.</p>
<p>Cineplex would not disclose financial details, but analysts told Reuters they expected Cineplex to issue shares to Loews, which adding its 900 screens to Cineplex's 1,550 would make the new company the second largest theater operator in North America.</p>
<p>Cineplex shares rose 0.11 to 2.73 a share on 897,900 shares.</p>
<p>In other news, Inco Ltd. fell 0.20 to 43.45 after the union representing striking miners at Inco's Sudbury, Ontario nickel mine broke off talks after the company's latest offer failed to address union demands.</p>
<p>Local 6500 of the United Steelworkers of America said the ball was in Inco's court to resume talks on an earlier proposal from the union.</p>
<p>Inco's 4,670 miners in Sudbury have been on strike since midnight on June 2.</p>
