<p>Socialist Lionel Jospin agreed to form a new government on Monday after French voters humiliated President Jacques Chirac and swept the left to power, raising fresh questions over Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>The Gaullist president saw his greatest political gamble backfire when voters turfed out the centre-right government and returned the left to power.</p>
<p>Chirac had called a snap parliamentary election, 10 months early, to seek a friendly majority for the rest of his seven-year term until 2002.</p>
<p>Instead, he now faces five years of power-sharing or &quot;cohabitation&quot; with Jospin, his ideological rival and the man he beat for the presidency in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The president of the republic offered to appoint me as prime minister. I accepted,&quot; Jospin told reporters on the steps of the presidential palace after a 55-minute meeting with Chirac. He said he planned to form a government &quot;quickly, this week&quot;.</p>
<p>Sunday's result shifted European politics further to the left, a month to the day after a landslide election victory for Britain's Labour Party.</p>
<p>The French, preoccupied with record unemployment, punished Chirac at the polls for broken promises on jobs and taxes. They spurned his call for a &quot;new elan&quot; to prepare for a single European currency from January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The Socialists generally favour the planned single currency, the euro, but will rely for their parliamentary majority on Communists who oppose it.</p>
<p>Jospin has also ruled out further austerity to meet qualifying targets for the euro, including ceilings on the budget deficit, inflation and public debt.</p>
<p>Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, insisted that the planned single currency would go ahead as planned.</p>
<p>&quot;Germany and France remain for me the most important partners. We want to go further in Europe. The euro can be launched under strict adherence to the criteria and the planned timetable,&quot; Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel declared.</p>
<p>Financial markets were less certain. Forty market makers, economists and political analysts polled by Reuters put the chances of euro starting on time at 72 percent -- down from 82 percent on May 14.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel EMU will still go ahead, but the uncertainty has increased,&quot; said David Brickman, European economist at Yamaichi.</p>
<p>&quot;The uncertainty comes from the type of policies pursued and whether France will meet the budget deficit criteria as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.&quot;</p>
<p>Laxer qualifying standards for membership of the single currency would increase the chances of a &quot;softer&quot; euro with a wider membership from the outset, including countries such as Spain and Italy.</p>
<p>Edgar Meister, a board member of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, said the voyage towards economic and monetary union (EMU) may enter &quot;rougher waters&quot; in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;Since yesterday the constellation has been altered so that we might know in the next few weeks, not in 1998, whether the euro will be a stable currency,&quot; Meister said.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank is embroiled in a row with its own government over EMU. It has described as creative accounting a plan by Bonn to revalue gold reserves to plug gaps in public finances.</p>
<p>European Union foreign ministers took a cautious  approach to the French election outcome.</p>
<p>Asked about whether the Socialist victory could force a delay to EMU, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said: &quot;This is much too early for me to predict...We have to wait and see what position the new French government will take in this respect.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar soared to near four-week peaks against the mark and French franc in Europe, buoyed by the renewed uncertainty over the euro.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't know how this is going to play out so they're saying give me dollars, sterling, yen, Swiss francs -- anything that isn't involved in EMU,&quot; said Nigel Morgan, economic strategist at Old Mutual Portfolio Managers.</p>
<p>Socialist policies are seen by markets as less favourable to the corporate sector, as the party wants to halt privatisations of companies like France Telecom or Air France.</p>
<p>The Paris stock market plunged more than three percent at one point, though it later bounced back and turned positive as traders were forced to cover short positions.</p>
<p>The Socialists have pledged to create 700,000 jobs for young people, half of them in the public sector, over the next three years, and to cut the working week from 39 hours to 35 over five years without loss of pay.</p>
<p>But the Communists want much faster action on both pledges, as well as wage hikes for the low paid.</p>
<p>Final results showed the Socialists and their allies won 273 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly and the Communists 38. The ecologists won seven, their first seats in parliament.</p>
<p>The outgoing centre-right coalition, which had held 464 seats in the outgoing Assembly, crashed to 257, while the far-right National Front won one.</p>
<p>It is the third time in 11 years that French voters have condemned their leaders to awkward power-sharing between a president and prime minister of opposing parties.</p>
<p>In two previous spells of &quot;cohabitation&quot;, from 1986 to 1988 and from 1993 to 1995, the late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand claimed pre-eminence in foreign affairs and left day-to-day domestic policy to centre-right governments.</p>
