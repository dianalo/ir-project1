<p>Swiss shares ended firmer in selective trading on Thursday, with the focus on pharmaceuticals Novartis and Roche, and on cement prducer Holderbank, dealers said.</p>
<p>The market was supported at the start by Wall Street's gains on Wednesday. Firmer Swiss bond prices and a higher dollar were also seen as positive.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Swiss market index of leading shares ended 40.1 points higher at 4,665.7.</p>
<p>The all-share Swiss Performance Index gained 24.82 points to close at 2,952.14.</p>
<p>Roche saw selling while Novartis was sought during Thursday's dealers said. Roche certificates eased 80 francs to finish at 11,754.</p>
<p>Novartis registered shares gained 55 francs to end at 1,835 after it reported first quarter sales numbers.</p>
<p>Dealers said Novartis gained attention after the group's first quarter sales figures came out on Thursday above analysts' expectations. Roche had disappointed the market with its sales figures released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Novartis' first quarter sales were eight percent higher on a local currency basis.</p>
<p>Roche's first quarter sales rose three percent in local currencies.</p>
<p>Holderbank rose 28 francs to 1,144. Dealers said the cement producer's announcement of a restructuring earlier this week was seen as positive by analysts.</p>
<p>UBS reacted little, if at all, to statements made at its annual shareholders' meeting. Its bearer rose six francs to 1,328. Chief executive Mathis Cabiallavetta said at the bank's annual meeting that UBS had a very good start to the current year and was confident of a good result for the year.</p>
<p>Sulzer rose 14 francs to 994. The stock gained on share analyst recommendations, as well as order figures for the first quarter, which rose ten percent.</p>
<p>Winterthur fell 11 francs to 999 in late trading on a major sell order, one dealer said.</p>
<p>Options and futures trade on Soffex was high ahead of Friday's April expiry. Speculative demand was strong in UBS options. Volume was also up for Novartis.</p>
<p>A total of 136.687 options changed hands in a call-put-ratio of two to one. Implied volatilities remained high, dealers said.</p>
<p>Turnover in SMI futures was 14.465.</p>
