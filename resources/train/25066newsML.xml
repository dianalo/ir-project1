<headline>Woman in U.S. sex scandal ran cleaning service.</headline>
<dateline>WOODBRIDGE, Va. 1996-08-30</dateline>

<p>Sherry Rowlands, the callgirl whose alleged year-long affair with President Bill Clinton's top political adviser caused his resignation on Thursday, told her neighbours she ran a one-woman cleaning service.</p>
<p>The townhouse Rowlands shared with her sister and niece in this suburb about 30 miles south of Washington stood empty late on Thursday and all the shades were drawn. Journalists at the site said Rowlands' sister and niece loaded some luggage into their car earlier on Thursday and drove away.</p>
<p>Neighbours told local television stations Rowlands, 37, was pleasant and always ready to help out. Most were surprised about the revelations that led to the resignation of Clinton political strategist Dick Morris.</p>
<p>Several said Rowlands had told them she operated a cleaning service.</p>
<p>One relative of Rowlands told the Washington Post that a man announcing himself as Dick Morris called the town house in Prince William County about once a week for several months.</p>
<p>In its Friday editions, the paper also quoted the relative as saying that Rowlands had once shown family members a magazine photograph of Morris and described him as her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Rowlands lived in Pittsburgh and Virginia Beach and has three sons who live with her ex-husband, the Washington Post reported.</p>
<p>Morris' resignation followed a report that the married 48-year-old political strategist had a year-long affair with Rowlands at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington, his base while working for Clinton.</p>
<p>The report was published by the supermarket weekly tabloid Star magazine and reprinted in Thursday's edition of the New York Post. The Post said the tabloid had photos and videotapes to back up its story.</p>
<p>The Star said Morris bragged to Rowlands about how powerful he was and let her secretly listen to phone conversations with the president.</p>
<p>Richard Gooding, who wrote the Star story, told the local ABC affiliate that Rowlands had fallen on hard times and was &quot;not terribly proud&quot; of her work for an escort service.</p>
