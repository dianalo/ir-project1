<p>Singapore high sulphur fuel oil prices on Tuesday rose with a 380-cst cargo seen traded at $97, at least $4 per tonne higher than market assessments, industry sources said.</p>
<p>A European major sold to mideast bunker trader a 20,000 tonne cargo of 380-cst at $97 per tonne for August 3-7 loading.</p>
<p>Traders considered the traded price to be high, saying that the market was not that strong since there are adequate supplies in the region.  </p>
<p>A local trader who has to date purchased a total of 160,000 tonnes of fuel oil for July and August loading was notably absent from the market.</p>
<p>A few traders said the mideast bunker trader was covering a short position while others said it may sell the cargo to the local trader later.</p>
<p>Swaps were firmer with July and August last quoted at $99.25/$100 per tonne, up from Monday's quotes of $98.50/$99.25.  </p>
<p>Sentiment in the low sulphur waxy residue (LSWR) market remained strong despite Pertamina's additional allocations of 300,000 barrels for July, as the total volumes for July was still smaller than previous months.</p>
<p>Traders said most of the additional supplies were allocated to Indonesia's affiliate Permindo.</p>
<p>Pertamina initially allocated just 2.3 million barrels of LSWR for July. The additional allocations would bring Pertamina's total July export volumes to 2.6 million barrels.</p>
<p>This is significantly lower than Pertamina's June allocation at 3.1 million barrels.  </p>
<p>The reduced supplies from Indonesia was due to a shutdown of a 100,000 barrel-per-day crude unit at Cilicap refinery.</p>
<p>The smaller allocations coupled with strong demand in Japan because of a heatwave have pushed up LSWR prices in Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;Total demand is expected to amount to 3.4-3.5 million barrels while supply is just about 2.6 million barrels,&quot; said a trader from Jakarta.  </p>
