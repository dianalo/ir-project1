<p>Political turmoil undermined Turkish stocks on Tuesday as investors largely kept to the sidelines amid mounting uncertainty over the lifespan of the Islamist-led government.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100  .XU100 closed 0.42 percent lower at 1,435 on late selling after opening slightly higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The downtrend continues. It will continue like this unless political uncertainties are removed,&quot; said Hakan Derinkok of Polen Securities.</p>
<p>But brokers expected the index to encounter strong support at the 1,420 level.</p>
<p>The index has fallen 6.39 percent since the market opened on April 24 after a week-long holiday.</p>
<p>A threat from Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to push for early elections did not trigger any strong wave of selling in the afternoon session as share prices had already bottomed out, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today at any moment, whoever wants it, we are ready for elections,&quot; Erbakan told his Islam-based Welfare Party amid intensified opposition efforts to bring down his coalition with the conservative True Path Party.</p>
<p>Betul Bilgen, assistant general manager of Evis Securities, said investors had begun to think about alternative government models to replace Erbakan's troubled coalition, now just 10 months old.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock exchange is awaiting the new government model,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Bulent Ecevit, leader of Democratic Left Party, is holding talks with other opposition leaders on forming a government excluding Welfare, at odds with army over the implementation of anti-Islamist measures demanded by the top brass.</p>
<p>Turkish money markets kept calm.</p>
<p>Bond rates remained steady at around 98 percent and the lira closed at 135,270 versus the U.S. dollar, down from Monday's close of 135,200.</p>
<p>Bankers said the central bank's tight grip on the markets helped the lira remain stable.</p>
<p>But businessmen cautioned that the political crisis had further weakened the economy, already hit by big fiscal deficits and high inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget deficit has risen sharply. An 18-percent inflation in the first quarter has made it impossible to achieve the annual target (of 57 percent),&quot; said Hasan Ozmen, chairman of Izmir Trade Bourse.</p>
<p>Erbakan admitted on Tuesday for the first time that his government's 1997 budget was in trouble, confirming widespread scepticism among economic analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget was balanced in the first and second months. I am following it closely and in the third month big difficulties began to emerge,&quot; he told his party meeting in parliament.</p>
