<headline>Indian call money quoted higher, gilts sharply up.</headline>
<dateline>BOMBAY 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Indian call money was quoted in the 4.0-4.5 percent range in early trade Thursday but few trades were done as it was the fortnightly reporting day for banks, dealers said.</p>
<p>Call money ended Wednesday at 0.75-1.25 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said call money opened higher on Thursday on higher quotes by lenders seeking to push up rates after Wednesday's central bank auctions of government securities.</p>
<p>The RBI mopped up 11.79 billion rupees at an auction of 364-day treasury bills and 30 billion at a six-year bond auction.</p>
<p>&quot;Lenders are trying to drive rates up,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;But very few deals will be struck today as it is the reporting day.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said prices of government securities rose in early deals, after the RBI set a lower than expected cut-off yield at Wednesday's six-year bond auction.</p>
<p>The RBI set a cut-off of 11.83 percent against market expectations of 11.90-11.95.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are realigning on the new security,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Prices will be firm today and may rise further.&quot;</p>
<p>The 11.83 percent 2003 bond auctioned at par on Wednesday traded on Thursday at 101.25 rupees, dealers said.</p>
<p>Among other securities, the 12.59 percent 2004 rose to 104 rupees from its last traded price of 102.90 and the 12.50 percent 2004 jumped to 103.80 rupees from 102.75.</p>
