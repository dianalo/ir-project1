<title>UK: Tanker rates seen steady to weaker in Q2 - MSI.</title>
<headline>Tanker rates seen steady to weaker in Q2 - MSI.</headline>

<p>Tanker freight rates are likely to hold or even edge lower in the next quarter after their recent rise, Independent shipping consultant Maritime Strategies International(MSI) said on Monday.</p>
<p>However, MSI said VLCC and Suezmax earnings would rise again in the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;There were rate gains in all tanker sectors in January, but Aframaxes and product tankers were the star performers with average earnings reaching their highest levels since mid-1991,&quot; MSI said in its monthly Freight Forecaster analysis.</p>
<p>MSI said the rapid improvement in tanker earnings was in part due to strong seasonal demand which boosted world crude oil production to 74.8 million barrels per day (bpd) -- up 900,000 bpd on December levels.</p>
<p>It said that average Very large crude carrier (VLCC) earnings jumped by $6,000 per day in January to $19,200 with further gains at the beginning of February.</p>
<p>But it said that as the benefits of increased seasonal demand and the stimulus of the first full month of Iraqi crude oil exports moderated, it &quot;anticipated a lull in rates in the second quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However, the summer surge in westbound longhaul demand due to North Sea oil platform maintenance will push earnings close to $25,000 per day in July,&quot; it said of VLCC earnings.</p>
<p>The positive outlook for earnings could force charterers to be more active in the time charter market, MSI said, adding that softening newbuilding prices would increase the probability of a VLCC ordering boom.</p>
<p>MSI said it expected the Suezmax market to build on its growth over the last 12 months to average earnings in January of more than $20,000 per day. New highs for 130,000 dwt vessels would be reached later in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The upside potential of the Suezmax sector has been capped by the now well established competition from VLCCs on Suezmax trades,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>However, MSI added Suezmax owners are also showing a willingness to exploit new opportunities. It gave examples of a regular export trade developing from Venezuela and potential opportunities into the US West Coast to meet a shortfall in supply caused by a slowdown in Alaskan production.</p>
<p>Average Aframax earnings fell back by mid February, from rapid gains to around $22,100 per day in January for 80,000 dwt vessels, MSI said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, Aframax rates continue to follow a seasonal pattern and MSI expects the peak period for North Sea oil platform maintenance during June to August will produce a downturn in rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Product freight rates have also followed seasonal patterns and MSI forecast earnings for 30,000 dwt vessels would fall back over the next six months from spot highs of $18,300 per day in January as gas oil inventories were rebuilt and U.S. refinery maintenance programmes started up.</p>
