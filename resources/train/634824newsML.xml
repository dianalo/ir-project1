<title>UK: Oil markets unmoved by prospect of more Iraqi oil.</title>
<headline>Oil markets unmoved by prospect of more Iraqi oil.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>World oil markets were unruffled on Tuesday by news that the United Nations was likely to extend its &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal with Iraq.</p>
<p>The Security Council is expected to adopt a resolution as early as Wednesday allowing Iraq to sell another $2 billion worth of oil over the next six months.</p>
<p>Brent Blend crude, the world benchmark grade, was down eight cents at $19.44 a barrel at 0916 GMT in London. It has averaged $19.39 in the past four months.</p>
<p>The rollover of the Iraqi deal is &quot;already built into the market,&quot; said Bob Finch, head trader at Vitol SA, the world's largest independent oil trading and refining company.</p>
<p>The only uncertainty in oil markets had been whether the United States would approve an extension of the plan.</p>
<p>But on Monday a source familiar with Washington policy said the U.S. &quot;will be looking favourably toward the rollover&quot;.</p>
<p>The current deal, a humanitarian exception to the broader economic sanctions in place since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, expires on June 7.</p>
<p>Under its terms, Baghdad was allowed to use oil earnings to buy food, medicines and other necessities for ordinary Iraqis who have suffered under the sanctions regime.</p>
<p>    Oil markets have been volatile in recent weeks and   dealers</p>
<p>are waiting to see if the normal seasonal pick up in gasoline demand in the United States will be enough to underpin prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no urge to move out of the current price range,&quot; said Nigel Saperia, managing director of the oil division at Bankers Trust International in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally there's too much oil around but frankly there always is at this time of year,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Despite an overhang of prompt oil, due in part to overproduction by OPEC, the forward outlook is more balanced with winter demand likely to mop up unsold barrels, said traders.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and OPEC heavyweight, expects rising world oil demand to keep crude prices buoyant for the remainder of the year, a Gulf source said recently.</p>
<p>The source, familiar with oil policy in the kingdom, said Saudi expectations for demand on Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries crude this year had been revised higher.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia saw demand on OPEC oil at around 27 million barrels a day (bpd) on average this year compared to a previous projection of 26.3 million bpd made at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Whereas world demand looked set to rise by some two million bpd this year, extra supplies in 1997 from non-OPEC nations would reach only one million bpd.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have what most people see as 27 million bpd from OPEC and no more than an extra one million coming from non-OPEC then the market will continue balanced to tight,&quot; the Gulf source said.</p>
<p>For the second year running analysts have cut their forecasts for non-OPEC supply growth because new North Sea fields have failed to come on stream when planned.</p>
<p>Dealers are looking for two sets of industry figures this week to shed light on the market.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute publishes its latest figures for gasoline stocks, which have been running well below year ago levels.</p>
<p>On Friday the International Energy Agency in Paris, the West's oil watchdog, is due to release figures estimating global oil demand for next winter and beyond.</p>
<p>&quot;The key may well be how oil demand in Asia develops over the rest of the year,&quot; said Scott Carter, senior oil trader at U.S. refiner Tosco in London.</p>
<p>Asia is set to stay one of the fastest growing areas of oil demand over the next few years with Western demand rising relatively slowly.</p>
