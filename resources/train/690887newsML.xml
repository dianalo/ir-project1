<p>Australia's refining industry on Thursday warned it was seriously considering closing down plants unless profitability was restored to sustainable levels.</p>
<p>The Australian Institute of Petroleum, which represents the four locally-based refiners, issued the warning after it released an independent report outlining the slump in profits.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the Australian refineries may have to close and that's a possibility that's been flagged by one or two of the four refining companies,&quot; institute executive director Jim Starkey told reporters on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Australia's eight refineries are run by the Royal Dutch/Shell group, Mobil Corp, British Petroleum Plc and Ampol, a joint venture between Caltex Australia Ltd and Pioneer International Ltd.</p>
<p>Ampol, Australia's largest refiner and marketer, and Shell have both canvassed the possibility of plant closures.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time I have heard the refiners talking about the possibility of refinery closures and they are at a point where it's being considered as a serious possibility,&quot; Starkey added.  </p>
<p>The annual report, prepared by accountants Ernst and Young, showed that underlying refinery earnings for calendar 1996 in Australia represented a return of just 5.2 percent on equity.</p>
<p>Net sales revenue for the four refiners rose 10 percent in 1996, but on a per-unit basis net sales revenue has fallen 12 percent in real terms for all products since 1992, it said.</p>
<p>Net profit, adjusted for a revaluation of stocks, amounted to a total A$222 million, it lowest level since the annual survey of refiners' profits began in 1992.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are now looking at a really low level of new investment now being put into the industry...,&quot; said the institute's manager of government and public policy, Ewan Macpherson.</p>
<p>Capital expenditure totalled A$623 million in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a major reduction year on year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The institute said refiners needed a freer hand to restructure its retail network of service stations in order to improve profitability to sustainable levels.</p>
<p>The institute said current laws inhibits the extent to which retailers can control the retail market by limiting the number of service stations they can operate to five percent.  </p>
<p>Refiners want this restriction loosened.</p>
<p>Australia has about 9,000 service stations.</p>
<p>The number is shrinking as competition, a glut of cheap imported petrol and a squeeze on profit margins from refineries to the petrol pump reshapes the industry, the institute said.</p>
<p>The local refiners own about 3,400 local service stations but claim current laws limit their ability to respond to new, independently owned stations mushrooming around the country.</p>
<p>The independents, including surpermarket chain Woolworths Ltd, are selling a lot of Asian product into Australia.  </p>
<p>In response, refiners want to close many of their smaller service stations, merge them or build new ones able to compete with the large, independent outlets.</p>
<p>&quot;The need is urgent because the companies are bleeding,&quot; Starkey said.</p>
