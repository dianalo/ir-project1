<p>The Malaysian ringgit is the most favoured Asian currency to buy in 1997, according to a survey of financial institutions in Singapore and London released on Friday by the independent consultancy group I.D.E.A.</p>
<p>&quot;Malaysian fundamentals continue strong and indeed the ringgit outlook for the end of the first half of 1997 looks biased to 2.49 (to the U.S. dollar),&quot; the consultancy firm said in a statement analysing the survey results. For the end of 1997 respondents forecast a rate of 2.50 to the dollar.</p>
<p>The ringgit now trades at more than 2.52 to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>However, I.D.E.A. said there was a more marked preference for the ringgit out of Singapore than in London, with U.K. operators favouring the Indonesian rupiah.</p>
<p>David Lewis, head of research in Asia for I.D.E.A., said the company surveyed about 75 financial institutions around Southeast Asia and in London and New York.</p>
<p>The survey found a difference in views in London and Asia on the prospects for a change to the foreign exchange rate regime in Indonesia in which the government only permits a narrow trading band for dollar-rupiah.  </p>
<p>I.D.E.A. said the London viewpoint on Indonesia was to expect a widening in the permitted trading band for dollar-rupiah in the first half of 1997 with a projection for the spot currency value of 2,400 by mid-1997.</p>
<p>It said Asian-based traders expected a band widening in the second quarter (corrects from second half) of 1997, and forecast a first quarter (corrects from mid-year) spot rate of around 2,409. Dollar-rupiah today is around 2,362.</p>
<p>In the case of the Thai baht, London players were more uncertain about future levels than Singapore respondents. I.D.E.A. said this may be due to more fear among offshore players of a major policy change in Thailand.</p>
<p>&quot;The million dollar question here is whether exports will pick up and, if they do, will this be enough to kick-start the economy,&quot; the analysts said.</p>
<p>In terms of political risk the survey found that banks overall did not regard Hong Kong as place in the region suffering the most political risk, despite the British colony's handover to China at the end of June.</p>
<p>&quot;That dubious honour goes to Indonesia, a by-product of 1996 riots, parliamentary elections this year and presidential polls in 1998,&quot; the analysts said.  </p>
<p>Respondents picked the Philippine peso as the currency most likely to rise to prominence in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Both centres favour the peso to become more important in terms of forex trade this year,&quot; I.D.E.A. said.</p>
<p>Other currencies mentioned by survey respondents as rising in prominence were the Chinese yuan, the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean won.</p>
