<headline>OPINION - Too early for Philippine inflation celebration.</headline>

<p>The Philippine government's fiscal and monetary authorities must be both perplexed and disappointed. Despite a series of feel-good economic news - higher GNP growth, lower unemployment and, more recently, a lower than expected inflation rate - the Manila stock market remained unimpressed. Under normal circumstances, such a mix of good news would have started a bull run. Yet foreign players have stopped buying while quite a number have unloaded and packed up.</p>
<p>As the September inflation rate was being unveiled, self-congratulatory statements were being issued by Philippine monetary and economic authorities from two distant places - Manila and Washington. It is not clear whether such self-congratulations are in order, however. Perhaps it's a bit too early for a celebration party.</p>
<p>Is the trend towards lower inflation sustainable? Let us look at the facts and their implications. A 4.4 percent inflation rate for September would move the actual average inflation closer to the government's revised target of 8.5 percent. But meeting this thrice-revised target will not be a cinch.</p>
<p>Despite the sharp drop in the inflation rate in September, the average inflation rate from January to September still stands at 9.7 percent. But that is still significantly higher than the government's original target of 5.0 percent (refer to the 1996 Budget Call and the revised Medium-Term Development Plan), or the adjusted inflation target of 6.0 to 7.0 percent (refer to the Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing). The bottom line is that the actual average inflation rate for 1996 will be higher than the 8.1 percent inflation rate in 1995 and the three sets of targets for 1996. That's retrogression, not progress.</p>
