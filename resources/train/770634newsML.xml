<p>Being a punk rock legend is usually a mixed blessing.</p>
<p>As the Sex Pistols demonstrated, if they do not die in pathetic circumstances (Sid Vicious), they grow old, write their memoirs and become minor celebrities (John Lydon). But some punks continue to churn out provocative work, working on the fringes of a music industry that never embraced the genre unless it was tidied up for MTV and called &quot;grunge.&quot;</p>
<p>Detroit's MC5 broke up nearly a decade before MTV was launched in 1981, but in six years the hell-raising band embraced causes that would be too revolutionary for most groups today, with the possible exception of fiery Los Angeles quartet Rage Against the Machine.</p>
<p>Singer-guitarist Wayne Kramer, who co-founded the band with his boyhood friend, the late Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith, in 1966, is helping to keep the MC5's memory alive, as well as furthering his own musical career. Making up for lost time, he is promoting &quot;Citizen Wayne,&quot; his third solo album in three years for Los Angeles-based punk rock label Epitaph Records.</p>
<p>After the demise of the MC5, Kramer turned to heroin and spent two years in prison for selling cocaine to an undercover cop. After overcoming a methadone addiction, he got married and slowly resumed his musical career in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Now 49, he is criss-crossing the United States and Europe in a van playing gigs wherever club owners will have him.</p>
<p>LEGEND BUSINESS NOT ALL THAT GREAT</p>
<p>&quot;The legend business is not all it's cracked up to be,&quot; he told Reuters in a recent interview at a West Hollywood restaurant near his home. &quot;I'm struggling to make a living in rock 'n' roll, just like every band out there.&quot;</p>
<p>Like any artist, he wants to reach as many people as possible. But what sort of people? &quot;The average 17-year-old, jean-wearing, skateboarding, suburban, baseball cap-sideways kid doesn't know the story of Wayne Kramer or the MC5, so how do I reach them? How do we find these people that are interested in something more than mindless kiddie culture?&quot;</p>
<p>Not that he is elitist or anything but Kramer has survived enough shifts in contemporary musical tastes to know people have short attention spans. He figures his core audience is aged 20 to 35 and he is surprised at how many women turn up.</p>
<p>For their money, audiences get to see Kramer justify his inclusion in British magazine Mojo's list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. Backed by a tight rhythm section, he delivers socially conscious songs that dwell on such topics as urban decay, government corruption and the ever-elusive American dream. With his past, he knows of what he speaks.</p>
<p>As an encore, he might perform the MC5's &quot;Kick out the Jams.&quot; Many of the songs from &quot;Citizen Wayne&quot; refer to that era and he calls the ambitious album &quot;auto-mythological,&quot; but there is no rose-coloured nostalgia. &quot;I don't think anyone of any intelligence could honestly call themselves an optimist. But I do believe that we could be prisoners of hope. I don't see anything out there that really encourages me, 'Oh boy, everything's gonna work out fine,'&quot; he said.</p>
<p>BAND LED ATTACK ON THE ESTABLISHMENT</p>
<p>As the house band for the radical White Panther Party, which promised &quot;rock &amp; roll, dope and f---ing in the streets,&quot; the MC5 helped lead pop culture's attack on the establishment. The quintet helped pave the way for punk rock but it was a tough fight. The band's three albums sold poorly and legal and internal problems abounded.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of my job is to try to tell the last great untold story of the '60s: What happened in Detroit and what happened to this band the MC5? The record's the soundtrack,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll write the memoirs when I'm old and sitting up on that rocking chair, smoking a joint, dispensing wisdom to all the young bucks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Revolution in Apt. 29&quot; pokes fun at what he describes as &quot;champagne Marxists, college students who talk the talk, and then, 'I can't smash the state today, I've got classes.'&quot; It recalls the occasion in 1968 when the MC5 was the only band to play for protesters at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, after the likes of the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson Airplane were no-shows.</p>
<p>&quot;Count Time&quot; is Kramer's prison song but with a humorous angle. &quot;Nobody wants to hear a melodramatic 'woe is me, I was locked up in a penitentiary,'&quot; Kramer said.</p>
<p>He is happy to dispense one piece of free advice now: &quot;My attitude is to have nothing to do with law enforcement whatsoever. Have no contact with them and never joke with them and never play games with them. They've got badges, they've got guns, and if they feel threatened they'll use them both against you. That's a lot of power.&quot;</p>
