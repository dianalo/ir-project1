<p>The government's plans to exempt small firms from the law on unfair dismissals as part of a new drive to cut red tape and boost Britain's competitiveness could itself be anti-competitive, the Labour party said on Monday.</p>
<p>The opposition party's education and employment spokesman, David Blunkett, said the proposals could encourage some companies to break into smaller units to be designated as small firms.</p>
<p>&quot;A basic entitlement for employees should not depend on the size of the company, but on a basic set of minimum standards for all individuals,&quot; Blunkett said in a statement.  </p>
<p>He was responding to an announcement by the government that it will consult on a recommendation by its Deregulation Task Force that small firms should be exempted from the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals in respect of unfair dismissal legislation for new employees.</p>
<p>The government said it would consider whether some other provision, such as an extended qualifying period for new employees in small firms, would be appropriate.</p>
<p>The proposed change would not affect current employees or extend to other grounds for access to industrial tribunals.  </p>
<p>Other deregulation initiatives, announced by Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine at a news conference, include:</p>
<p>-- Repealing the Trustee Investments Act by a deregulation order this autumn. This will save charitable trusts at least 40 million stg a year by removing restrictions on where they can invest for the best retruns.</p>
<p>-- Cutting the number of government surveys and statistical forms, saving industry 17.5 million stg a year by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>But the government rejected a recommendation that it delay implementation of new regulations covering activity centres.</p>
<p>It also said it would go ahead with consultations on whether to regulate the private security industry, contrary to the panel's advice that any public concerns could be met by imposing a new legal duty on employers not to hire convicted criminals.</p>
