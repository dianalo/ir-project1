<p>Yen-denominated gold futures ended mostly lower on Thursday, as spot gold prices were under selling pressure ahead of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting on Friday to discuss a gold sales plan, traders said.</p>
<p>Most active benchmark August ended two yen lower at 1,337 yen, down from the day's high of 1,345 yen.</p>
<p>Other contracts ranged from five yen per gram weaker to three yen firmer.</p>
<p>Bullion slipped to $381.90/382.40 per ounce at 0734 GMT, on selling by overseas investors, against $383.00/383.50 in New York on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The spot gold market was nervous due to IMF talks on possible gold sales, and spot gold may probe support at $380 per ounce,&quot; a trading house trader said. Producers' selling was detected in the spot gold market during Asian hours.</p>
<p>In the gold futures market, early bargain-hunting buying in response to the yen's drop ebbed in the afternoon session, pressured by the bearish spot gold market.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold futures are more sensitive to bearish factors recently, rather than to bullish factors,&quot; an analyst at a commodity broker said.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium futures also settled weaker.  </p>
<p>Sentiment in platinum group metals remains bearish, with no bullish factors in sight. Amid a lack of buying interest by private investors, selling by trade houses weighed down prices.</p>
<p>Platinum futures ranged from four to eight yen per gram lower with benchmark August finishing down four at 1,368 yen.</p>
<p>Palladium futures ranged from five yen per gram weaker to four yen higher. Benchmark August was down three at 433 yen.</p>
<p>Silver futures were mixed, ranging from 1.1 yen per 10 grams lower to 0.6 yen firmer. Benchmark August was down 1.1 yen at 181.1 yen.</p>
