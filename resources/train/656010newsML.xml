<p>Russia hammered a belated nail in the coffin of the Soviet Union on Thursday by lowering Soviet flags from its Black Sea ships and replacing them with blue-and-white tsarist banners.</p>
<p>To the strains of the Soviet anthem, Russian Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev oversaw the removal of probably the last flag bearing the image of a hammer and sickle still flying officially on former Soviet territory.</p>
<p>&quot;St Andrew's flag -- the pride of Russian sailors -- is again being raised on the ships of the Black Sea Fleet today, on Russia's main state holiday,&quot; President Boris Yeltsin said in an address Sergeyev read out to the sailors.</p>
<p>Years of bickering over the Fleet's division between Russia and Ukraine had left Moscow's lion's share in limbo -- while its sister ships in the Russian navy sailed under the flag of Peter I as the Fleet did when it was founded in the 18th century.</p>
<p>But the two countries signed a much-delayed friendship treaty last month and settled terms for the ships' presence on Ukrainian territory for another 20 years, and Russia seized the chance to raise its naval flag on Constitution Day.</p>
<p>Memories of the Fleet's 200-year history are so strong it had become a symbol for Russian nationalists' post-Soviet claims to Sevastopol and the Crimean peninsula, ceded by Nikita Khrushchev to Kiev in 1954 and now in independent Ukraine.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Fleet's bravest moment was in the 1850s when sailors sunk their ships in Sevastopol Bay to stop invading British, Turkish, Italian and French forces who bombarded the port for 349 days from taking the port.</p>
<p>&quot;The unparalleled feat of the Black Sea sailors who defended Sevastopol during the Crimean War is etched on the people's memory forever,&quot; Yeltsin wrote.</p>
<p>But its fate as it rots in the bays of Sevastopol seems all the more bitter to Soviet veterans when they recall how the Fleet defended the port from a Nazi siege during the Great Patriotic War as World War Two is known in Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;The heroes' everlasting glory was augmented by Black Sea sailors during the Great Patriotic War. The 250-day defence of Sevastopol will remain a sumbol of courage and unbending determination for all future generations,&quot; Yeltsin wrote.</p>
<p>But the division of the fleet has also sparked division among locals, with sailors who once served side-by-side now serving for two different national navies.</p>
<p>One Russian officer who attended the ceremony voiced the opposition of many of his colleagues to the division of the fleet, split 50-50 with Kiev giving up most of its ships in return for debt forgiveness.</p>
