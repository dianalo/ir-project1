<p>Inter-Regional Financial Group Inc said Tuesday its Dain Bosworth brokerage unit had record pre-tax earnings for 1996 of $64.6 million, up from $43.3 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Dain's revenues for the year rose to $408.8 million from $351.5 million.  For the fourth quarter, Dain's earnings increased to $18.9 million from $13.9 million, and revenues rose to $107.6 million from $95.1 million.</p>
<p>Inter-Regional said its Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc unit earned $31.5 million in 1996, up from $18.0 million a year ago.  Its revenues rose to $212.0 million from $187.5 million.  </p>

<p>&quot;In 1997, we expect continued strong performance from Dain Bosworth in the northwestern quadrant of the United States, and we expect to profitably capture more of the dynamic growth in the Southwest through Rauscher Pierce Refsnes,&quot; Irving Weiser, chairman of Inter-Regional, said in a statement.</p>
