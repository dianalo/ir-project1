<p>Indonesian benchmark tyre-grade SIR20 offer prices remained weak in slow late trading on Friday, but sentiment on latex was seen firm, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;SIR20 prices remain weak. There are some enquiries from Singapore and the U.S. but no deals are heard despite recent price falls in various cities,&quot; one Medan-based dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said SIR20 offer prices for October/November were at 56.00-56.50 U.S. cents/lb fob Medan and at 55.75-56.25 cents fob Palembang, Surabaya and Padang, and at 55.25-55.75 cents fob Jambi and Pontianak.  </p>
<p>They said falls in Tokyo on Friday also dampened the already weak market sentiment.</p>
<p>One Medan-based dealer said sentiment on latex was likely to firm up next week due to talk of possible supply falls following the loading of some 2,000 tonnes of latex in Medan to the U.S.</p>
<p>High amoniac grade latex prices were last traded at 2,240 rupiah/kg in Medan and at 2,230 rupiah/kg in the western Javanese cities of Bandung and Tangerang, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Medan-based dealer said he sold SIR3CV at 150 U.S. cents/kg recently, but added prices were likely to fall as the state-owned plantations were making offers at around 137 cents/kg.</p>
