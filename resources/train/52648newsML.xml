<p>The Venezuelan government will stick to its economic adjustment program in spite of the windfall of unexpected revenues thanks to a recent rise in oil prices, Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The adjustment program will continue even if oil rises to a $1,000 per barrel,&quot; the colorful minister told reporters after a meeting with cabinet colleagues.  </p>
<p>Venezuelan oil export prices have climbed to a five-year high of $20.40 per barrel following U.S. military intervention in Iraq last week. Government officials have said the higher-than-expected oil prices will bring in more than $2.5 billion in unbudgeted revenues.</p>
<p>Petkoff, who fought against the government as a communist guerrilla in the 1960s, said the government was more concerned about the non-oil sector of the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obvious that the oil sector is going to grow more than was expected, but we are more interested in the non-oil sector where there will be no revision,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The non-oil sector will contract in 1996 before recovering next year, Petkoff said. He gave no specific figures.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic growth will come next year just as was expected before (U.S. President Bill) Clinton began bombing (Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything to do with structural and institutional reforms, the privatization program, the restructuring of the state, reform to severance payments, all this continues as if Clinton were not doing anything,&quot; Petkoff added.</p>
