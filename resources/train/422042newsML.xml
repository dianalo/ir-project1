<p>Britain's cable television industry won 257,392 new subscribers in the 1996 fourth quarter, the highest quarterly increase ever in new subscribers, a watchdog group reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Independent Television Commission (ITC), in its quarterly report on cable television statistics, said a total of 1,872,962 homes subscribed to cable television as of January 1, 1997, resulting in a record-high penetration rate of 22.4 percent.</p>
<p>The penetration rate refers to the percentage of homes subscribing to cable television out of the total number of homes where the service is available, also known as the number of homes passed. There were 8,351,310 homes passed as of January 1, the ITC said.</p>
<p>The 22.4 percent penetration rate compared to 21.2 percent as of October 1, 1996, and a 22 percent rate as of January 1, 1996.</p>
<p>The cable television system operators, which also offer telephone service via their cable systems, had a total of 2,588,123 homes connected to television and/or telephone services as of January 1.</p>
<p>Newport was the cable franchise area with the highest penetration rate at 42.2 percent. Out of the approximately 100 franchise areas with more than 2,500 subscribers, Newport was one of 13 with a penetration rate over 30 percent, according to the ITC report.</p>
<p>The cable television industry in Britain has been plagued by a high rate of contract turnover but the ITC report gave no figures for so-called &quot;churn.&quot;</p>
