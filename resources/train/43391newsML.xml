<p>Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said late on Tuesday he would not reverse constitutional reforms which effectively bar his main opponent Kenneth Kaunda from standing for election in this year's presidential polls.</p>
<p>&quot;The position is that the Constitution of Zambia Amendment Act 1996 has already been enacted and is now the supreme law of the land,&quot; he said in a radio and television broadcast.</p>
<p>&quot;The (new) provisions of the constitution are the expression of the people's long-standing submissions in all the post-constitutional review commissions,&quot; Chiluba said.</p>
<p>The president had held talks with Kaunda, his predecessor, last month over the controversial new laws.</p>
<p>But another meeting scheduled for Monday, September 9, collapsed when Kaunda refused to attend the talks, saying it would be futile as the president was not being sincere in discussions with the opposition.</p>
<p>The constitutional changes have been widely condemned by the international community as an attempt by Chiluba to prolong his own term in office.</p>
<p>Western governments led by the United States have threatened to cut or freeze aid to Zambia unless the changes are reversed.</p>
<p>Kaunda, leader of the United National Independence Party (UNIP), led the country from independence in 1964 up to 1991.</p>
<p>He wanted to challenge Chiluba for the presidency in the polls later this year but the amended constitution rules him out of the race because his parents were not Zambian, but Malawian, and because he has ruled for more than two terms already.</p>
<p>Another clause banning traditional leaders from engaging in active politics bars Kaunda's deputy, Chief Inyambo Yeta, from standing in his stead.</p>
<p>Six leaders of the UNIP party including Yeta are currently on trial for treason, accused of being behind the Black Mamba, a shadowy group in whose name bombs have been planted in several parts of Zambia to protest at the constitutional ban on Kaunda.</p>
<p>The bombs exploded at the presidential residence, Lusaka's international airport -- killing a policeman -- and at offices of a state-run newspaper. Kaunda has accused the government of fabricating the charges in an effort to discredit his party.</p>
<p>Chiluba did not announce a date for the presidential and parliamentary polls, which must be held before the end of October this year.</p>
