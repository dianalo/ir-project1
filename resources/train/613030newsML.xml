<p>France voted on Sunday in the first round of a parliamentary election that will either renew backing for conservative President Jacques Chirac or condemn him to share power in an uneasy tandem with left-wingers.</p>
<p>Voting by France's 39 million electors began more briskly than in the past two National Assembly polls despite fears of mass abstentions after a lacklustre campaign.</p>
<p>Turnout by midday (1000 GMT) was 22.74 percent, under sunny skies across much of the country, up from 21.4 percent in 1993.</p>
<p>Polling stations close at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) when first results, and pollsters' predictions of the overall winners, will be broadcast. A runoff will take place on June 1 in districts where no candidate wins more than 50 percent support.</p>
<p>Voters are choosing between the ruling centre-right, which promises reforms to scale down state control and a Socialist-led opposition pledging vigorous state job creation and a shorter working week to attack record 12.8 percent joblessness.</p>
<p>Opinion polls before a blackout last week showed that Prime Minister Alain Juppe's coalition was likely to retain power for the next five years, saving Chirac from awkward &quot;cohabitation&quot; with a left-wing government.</p>
<p>But the left was within reach of an upset. A total 6,389 candidates, including a record 1,469 women on a day coinciding with Mothers' Day in France, are standing for election to the 577-seat Assembly.</p>
<p>Juppe, shown by opinion polls last year to be the least popular prime minister since 1958, had to submit to an unexpected identity check when he voted in the southwestern city of Bordeaux where he is a candidate.</p>
<p>When a polling official asked him to identify himself, Juppe replied: &quot;Usually, it's enough to be well known&quot;. The official refused to budge, obliging Juppe to show his identity card.</p>
<p>Chirac, who called the vote saying France needed a &quot;new elan&quot; to help prepare for a single European currency, voted in Sarran, a village in central France.</p>
<p>Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin, who campaigned with the slogan &quot;Let's change the future&quot;, voted in Cintegabelle in the southwest where he is hoping to win re-entry to the National Assembly after losing his seat in 1993.</p>
<p>Many ordinary voters in Paris seemed to prefer shopping for Mothers Day dinners rather than voting -- markets were crammed with people as voters trickled into polling booths.</p>
<p>News bulletins devoted most time to the conviction in northwestern France of a man who killed a nine-year-old girl by lacing her medicine with cyanide, mistaking her antibiotics for those of his mistress's husband.</p>
<p>Chirac, who gambled in calling the vote 10 months early and two years into his own seven-year term, has said he will not resign if the left wins. But he has warned voters that a period of enforced &quot;cohabitation&quot; could weaken France's voice abroad.</p>
<p>With official campaigning banned from Friday midnight, no one was allowed to pass out pamphlets on Sunday, or shake hands with voters or kiss babies.</p>
<p>Juppe has cautioned that the initial results may be hard to interpret -- the combined left may get more of the first-round vote than the centre-right but still end up losing on June 1.</p>
<p>Runoffs between leading candidates are held in constituencies where no one takes at least 50 percent of the vote on Sunday.</p>
<p>Backers of the small extreme-right National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen are likely to be key arbiters of runoffs where their own candidates are eliminated -- in general they swing the election to the centre-right.</p>
<p>Juppe said he would maintain his austerity policies to help France qualify for a single European currency. He promised a public spending freeze, tax cuts, an accelerated privatisation programme and a reduction in both the size and role of the civil service to give more scope for private initiative.</p>
<p>The Socialist and Communist opposition said it would cut unemployment, the highest in the Group of Seven industrial nations, by creating 700,000 youth jobs and reducing the work week from 39 to 35 hours without loss of pay.</p>
<p>Jospin has ruled out taking any further austerity measures to enable France to qualify for the euro common currency from its creation in 1999 and he set conditions for joining, including the participation of Italy and Spain from the outset.</p>
