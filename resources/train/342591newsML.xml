<p>NKK Corp said on Wednesday it plans to spend 15 billion yen to repair a suspended blast furnace at its Fukuyama plant in Hiroshima, western Japan.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said NKK, Japan's second biggest crude steelmaker, had decided to repair the No.2 furnace in the 1998/99 business year because its No.5 furnace at Fukuyama and No.1 furnace at its Keihin plant have become obsolete.</p>
<p>The Fukuyama plant's production capacity is expected to remain unchanged at just under 10 million tonnes after the renovation, NKK said.  </p>
<p>Steel production at the No.2 furnace was suspended in August 1994. The Fukuyama plant has three furnaces.</p>
<p>The company said it has yet to decide when the No.2 furnace will resume operations.</p>
<p>The No.2 furnace has an annual production capacity of about two million tonnes of crude steel.</p>
<p>The Nihon Keizai Shimbun economic daily reported on Wednesday that NKK will restart a blast furnace to meet increasing demand for steel in Asia and boost the Fukuyama plant's production capacity to 12 million tonnes a year.</p>
<p>&quot;That story was totally incorrect. We don't have plans to boost production capacity. We can cope with rising demand for steel with our current facilities as our facilities are not operating at full capacity,&quot; the NKK spokesman said.</p>
<p>Industry sources say furnaces of Japanese steelmakers are now operating at about 80 to 90 percent of capacity.</p>
