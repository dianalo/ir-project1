<title>UK: C&amp;W sees German telecom deal lifting earnings.</title>
<headline>C&amp;W sees German telecom deal lifting earnings.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cable and Wireless Plc said on Wednesday that its German telecom alliance with Germany's Veba AG would boost earnings, cash and its balance sheet because German utility RWE had joined the fold.</p>
<p>The alliance, called Vebacom, would have an agreed asset value of 4.8 billion marks and would reduce C&amp;W's start-up costs as Germany's telecom markets are liberalised.  </p>
<p>C&amp;W will keep hold of its 45 percent stake in Vebacom.</p>
<p>But under the new deal, hammered out after RWE quit a former alliance with British Telecommunications and Viag, the network and services operations of Vebacom and RWECOM would be combined into two new companies.</p>
<p>These would be a services company and a network company, with Cable &amp; Wireless effectively owning 22.5 percent of the new grouping. RWE will contribute net cash of about 2.5 billion marks plus existing assets to the two new companies.</p>
<p>As the new companies will be overcapitalised, about two billion marks will be returned to the alliance partners.  </p>
<p>Cable &amp; Wireless' share would be 450 million marks, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The new alliance will, in my view, be the leading competitor in Europe's biggest national market,&quot; said Richard Brown, the chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless.</p>
<p>&quot;Cable &amp; Wireless will play a key management role as the international telco (telecom group) in the alliance. This will combine with the acknowledged strength of Vebacom's telecoms operations and RWE's access to extensive network infrastructure.</p>
<p>He noted that the group would be in a prime position to compete against German telecom giant Deutsche Telekom as the EU telecom market moves towards liberalisation in 1998.  </p>
<p>&quot;This transaction underscores the value of our investment in Germany, materially reduces our exposure to start-up losses and will favourably impact our earnings, cash and balance sheet,&quot; Brown stated.</p>
<p>Vebacom will have a 51 percent stake in the services company -- called Servco -- and a 49 percent shareholding in the network company -- dubbed Netco. RWECOM, in which RWE will have a 75 percent stake and Veba 25 percent, will take 49 percent and 51 percent in the two respectively.</p>
<p>The deal is subject to regulatory approval.</p>
