<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices on Friday remained directionless and were expected to be stuck in a range with most players looking to the crude market for a lead, traders said.</p>
<p>Bid/asked for cash 180 cst supplies for October loading were likely to hover between $115 and $117 a tonne--similiar to Thursday's levels, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;At this price, people are cautious to take length,&quot; one major said.</p>
<p>Players are looking to sell to China where bids were seen around $128 per tonne, cost-and-freight basis, one trader said.  </p>
<p>Sources report the recent sale of an 80,000-tonne 380 cst cargo from Kuwait for loading in mid-October at about $2.10 premium to Singapore spot quotes, on a c-and-f basis.</p>
<p>They said another 80,000-tonne cargo would be shipped in October from Kuwait to Singapore.</p>
<p>Despite the rise in imports some traders remained bullish on lower stocks in Singapore which for the week ending September 25 stood at 9.737 million barrels--below the typical 10-11 million barrels earlier this year, according Singapore's Trade Development Board data.  </p>
<p>October paper, was bid/asked at $115.50/116.50, slightly firmer than Thursday's quotes at $115.25/$116.25.</p>
