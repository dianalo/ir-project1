<p>It was a cold night when Oetzi lay down on an Alpine pasture to rest his arthritic bones.</p>
<p>Some 5,300 years later, his frozen, tattoed body was dug out of a glacier in a remote Tyrolean valley, leading experts to hail him as the world's oldest mummy.</p>
<p>The iceman was found in September 1991 by German tourists on the 3,000 metre (9,000 feet) high Similaun glacier in the Oetz Valley, after which he is named.</p>
<p>Since then, 40 teams of experts from around the world have been working on the man who came in from the cold, believed to have died from exhaustion at an age of about 45.</p>
<p>&quot;The iceman is in good condition,&quot; said Werner Platzer, head anatomist at Innsbruck university.</p>
<p>Oetzi is being kept in a sarcophagus at a steady temperature of minus six degrees centigrade (21.20 Fahrenheit) and at a humidity of 98 percent at the Institute of Alpine Prehistory, a home specially created for him.</p>
<p>Studies of the iceman found he had probably been about 164 centimetres (5.3 feet) tall at the time of his death, but that he has since shrunk to 159 centimetres.</p>
<p>His weight seems to have droped to about 40 to 50 kg (88 to 110 pounds) just before his death. Scientists found that he had suffered from worms and ensuing diarrhoea.</p>
<p>However, there are also signs that Oetzi fell prey to other ailments. The 57 tattoos found around various joints of his body led scientists to conclude that in neolithic times tattoos were used for therapy -- and that Oetzi sufferred from arthritis.</p>
<p>So far 50 tiny probes have been taken from his body using titanium instruments in order not to leave any trace. These samples have accumulated to a total 2.5 grammes (less than 0.1 ounce), Platzer said.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the professor examined the mummy's sexual organs, which Austrian newspapers speculated had been damaged when he was dug out of his glacial grave.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is still were it should be&quot;, Platzer said. &quot;It's only that it's shrunk so much one could get the idea it was missing.&quot;</p>
<p>Both his lungs as well as his liver were in an advanced state of atrophy, Platzer said.</p>
<p>The next project will be modelling an exact replica of the neolithic alpinist's skeleton. This and further projects will likely take two more years at a cost of some 100 million schillings ($10 million).</p>
<p>Thereafter, Oetzi will probably travel to Bolzano, the capital of Italy's South Tyrol (Alto-Adige), where he will be put to final rest in a museum.</p>
<p>The Italian government has claimed the rights on the mummy because it was found some ten metres (yards) on the Italian side of the Oetztal Alps.</p>
<p>Last month a discovery near Linz, in northern Austria threatened to steal Oetzi's place as the country's favourite mummy.</p>
<p>Local archaeologist Manfred Pertlwieser unearthed remains dating back some 6,500 years -- the skeleton of a girl aged 12 to 13.</p>
<p>Pertlwieser is convinced that his find was once mummified but later suffered irreversible damage because of rising humidity. The skeleton is in excellent condition given its age and has given experts valuable clues to the child's life and early death.</p>
<p>&quot;Her story is a tragedy,&quot; Pertlwieser said. &quot;The body language shows that the little girl was suffering from hypothermia and died while she lay at the family's fireplace.&quot;</p>
<p>He believes her family was unable to bury her because it was winter and the earth was frozen.</p>
