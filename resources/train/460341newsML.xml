<p>A nine-year-old Miami boy who said his stepfather beat him constantly, finally called the emergency number 911 to plead for help, police said on Friday.</p>
<p>Police rushed to the house and later arrested the man, Wayne Anthony Bevan, on a charge of aggravated child abuse.</p>
<p>The boy called Miami police on Tuesday afternoon when his stepfather left the house after allegedly giving him another beating.</p>
<p>&quot;He picked me up and threw me on the floor really hard,&quot; the child told a 911 dispatcher. &quot;I don't know where he is right now but when he comes home he says he's going to do something else to me and I'm very scared.&quot;</p>
<p>He gave his name and address then asked: &quot;Can you help me...how long is it going to take you guys to come?&quot;</p>
<p>The boy's mother Jenny Bevan has also been arrested on charges of child neglect. Relatives are looking after the boy, whose name was not released, and his younger brother.</p>
