<p>The Senate on Tuesday began hearings into financing of the 1996 presidential campaign which involve a tangled web of allegedly illegal foreign contributions and improper use of the White House to solicit funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The allegations before us are serious...These matters go to the basic integrity of our governent and our electoral process,&quot; Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chairman Fred Thompson said as he gaveled open the long-awaited and potentially explosive hearings.  </p>
<p>The four weeks of hearings will look into President Bill Clinton's campaign ties to foreign money, with current and former senior White House aides ordered to appear before investigators. Democrats have also called for Republican party officials to testify on allegations they also received possibly improper contributions from Asian donors.</p>
<p>Thompson said the lengthy hearings will look into illegal foreign contributions, money-laundering, influence-peddling, violations of the conflict of interest laws, the improper use of the White House in fund-raising activities and questions of whether our government's domestic and foreign policies were affected by political contributions.&quot;</p>
<p>The Tennessee Republican has not revealed the names of the first witnesses. They will not be called to testify until Wednesday.</p>
<p>In televised opening remarks Thompson cited efforts by both Taiwan and China to influence U.S. foreign policy including the administration's decision to permit Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to visit his college alma mater, Cornell University in New York.</p>
