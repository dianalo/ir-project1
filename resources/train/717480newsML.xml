<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition on Wednesday appeared to have overcome some of the worst tensions in its 14 years in power to wrap up this year's budget talks and stay on target to join European monetary union.</p>
<p>Party leaders from the coalition of Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU) and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) were set to agree on the last details later in the day and cabinet was to approve the budget on Friday.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel, after more than a week of negotiating with federal ministers on spending targets, has completed the draft budget and will present it to cabinet on Friday, the Finance Ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a draft for the 1998 budget that conforms to the constitution,&quot; a Finance Ministry spokeswoman told reporters in Bonn, confirming that the budget planning included financing for the Eurofighter military jet.</p>
<p>Tax reform talks with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), however, appeared to be making little headway.</p>
<p>Government sources had said that the budget planning includes 850 million marks in financing for the Eurofighter in 1998 and 1.2 billion marks in 1999. Bonn plans to buy 180 aircraft.</p>
<p>&quot;It is correct that the Eurofighter financing is included in the budget planning,&quot; the spokeswoman added.</p>
<p>The coalition leaders are expected to give their blessing on Wednesday evening to a supplementary budget for 1997 and the draft budget for 1998.</p>
<p>The government has given no details of the supplementary budget or the 1998 budget plans, but with the deal wrapped up coalition sources began leaking figures.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget was hit by Germany's postwar-record unemployment levels. Costs related to unemployment drove up the financing requirements of the Labour Ministry, the single largest item in the federal budget, so that the labour budget is now expected to surge to over 140 billion marks from original plans of 127 billion marks.</p>
<p>As a result total federal spending will rise to 459 billion marks this year, compared to original budget plans of 440.2 billion, and the budget deficit will surge to 70 billion marks from previous forecasts of 53.3 billion.</p>
<p>Coalition sources said government spending in 1998 would total 461 billion marks. That is up from an original target of 447 billion because of high unemployment and weak tax revenues.</p>
<p>Waigel has already confirmed he plans a budget deficit of around 58 billion marks next year.</p>
<p>Tax receipts have also been lower than originally expected and created additional financing gaps of around 30 billion marks this year and next year.</p>
<p>The government coalition came close to the breaking point as Waigel refused to rule out tax increases and the FDP dug in its heels and the government finally agreed not to raise taxes.</p>
<p>Despite progress on the budget, talks with the SPD on trying to break a logjam over tax reform appear to be stuck.</p>
<p>Government legislation to introduce 30 billion marks in income tax cuts over the next two years passed in the lower house last week but was defeated by the opposition-controlled upper house.</p>
<p>The mediation committee of both houses of parliament is set to begin meeting on Thursday to try to reach a compromise, but preliminary meetings this week of government and opposition tax experts broke off on Tuesday without coming any closer.</p>
