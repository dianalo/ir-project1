<p>Dentsu Inc, the world's largest advertising agency, said on Tuesday it had opened a new office in Vietnam in response to rapid growth in the economy and the advertising industry.</p>
<p>Tokyo-based Dentsu said in a statement received in London that total advertising expenditure in Vietnam was doubling every year and was expected to continue to grow quickly due to foreign investment.</p>
<p>Dentsu opened its first office in Vietnam three months ago, in the commercial centre of Ho Chi Minh City. It opened its second &quot;representative office&quot; in the capital, Hanoi, on October 1.</p>
<p>Dentsu said total advertising expenditure in Vietnam had shot up from $8.0 million in 1992 to $12 million in 1993, $70 million in 1994, $140 in 1995 and $270 million in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;This repeated doubling suggests a strong likelihood of continued expansion in the industry,&quot; Dentsu said.</p>
<p>It said Vietnam's rapid economic growth and an increasing amount of Japanese investment made it an attractive market for advertising.</p>
<p>Dentsu said Vietnam's Gross Domestic Product rose 9.5 percent in 1995, the fastest rate since Hanoi adopted wide-sweeping economic reforms in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;This result means that Vietnam's economy has grown at a rate exceeding 8.0 percent for four consecutive years since 1992,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Dentsu said Japanese companies made 47 different investments in Vietnam totalling $1.13 billion in 1995, which placed Japan second only to Taiwan in terms of the biggest foreign investors in Vietnam.</p>
<p>It said advertising in Vietnam, which abandoned a centrally-planned economic system in the 1980s, was meant to &quot;make a positive contribution to the public profit&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;With the entrance of foreign corporations, however, the introduction of a free economy and the policy of opening up to the outside world, the advertising business is becomingly increasingly active,&quot; Dentsu said.</p>
<p>&quot;Dentsu's establishment of another representative office in this energetic market is a response to this market activity,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Advertising Age, the U.S. weekly, ranks Dentsu as the world's biggest ad agency, with $1.93 billion gross income. The second biggest is U.S.-based McCann-Erickson Worldwide.</p>
