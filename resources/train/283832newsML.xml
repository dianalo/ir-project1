<p>Two incumbent opposition members have won re-election to Singapore's parliament, dashing ruling People's Action Party (PAP) hopes of a clean sweep, according to official results announced early on Friday.</p>
<p>But in other single-member districts, the PAP knocked out two opposition incumbents seeking another term in Thursday's general election.</p>
<p>Workers' Party candidate Low Thia Khian and Singapore People's Party candidate Chiam See Tong each held onto their seats. The Singapore Democratic Party's two incumbents lost.  </p>
<p>Earlier it was announced that Singapore Democratic Party leader Chee Soon Juan was also soundly defeated in his bid for a seat in parliament.</p>
<p>The PAP also won the other six single-member constituencies at stake in the election, and one four-member multi-member constituency.</p>
<p>Returns from 18 other seats up for grabs in Thursday's election were to be announced later. The PAP had already taken 47 seats in the 83-member parliament on Nomination Day December 23, when the opposition failed to contest them.</p>
