<p>			TOP STORIES</p>
<p>The Times Of India</p>
<p>CONGRESS PARTY WITHDRAWS SUPPORT TO GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>The Congress party withdrew its support to the minority United Front government, causing political uncertainty. The Congress party later staked claim to form its own government, though it had only 140 members of parliaments in a house of 543. The Congress president met the president and handed over a letter stating that the party was withdrawing support to the 10-month-old government as it had failed to strengthen secular forces. It said the efforts of the government were determined to marginalise the Congress and to allow urgent national issues to take a back seat.</p>

<p>The Economic Times</p>
<p>FUTURE OF FINANCE BILL UNCERTAIN</p>
<p>The fate of the Finance Bill introduced in the lower house of parliament became uncertain with Congress party withdrawing support to the government. Since the Finance Bill was pending with the house, any new government could declare it null and void. Thus, technically, a new budget could be presented by a new government. However, most political parties do not appear inclined to derail the Finance Bill in its entirety. A Law Ministry official said there was no immediate crisis in regard to the government finances as the Appropriation Bill enabling it to draw money until July from the Consolidated Fund of India was already passed.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>FOREIGN DEBT FUNDS SET TO CROSS $1.3 BLN</p>
<p>The bourse regulator was in the process of clearing close to a billion dollars worth of foreign institutional investor (FII) debt funds. This would take the total of India-dedicated FII debt funds past the $1.3 billion mark, the limit set by the government for external commercial borrowings falling under FII debt for 1996/97. The Union Bank of Switzerland put in a single application for a $500 million debt fund, the largest of its kind so far. FII debt funds worth $425 million from Citicorp ($50 million), Buchannan Capital ($200 million) and Guinness Mahone ($175 million) were cleared. Clearance for the UBS fund was awaited.</p>

<p>INDIA BUSINESS OF DUN &amp; BRADSTREET RESTRUCTURED</p>
<p>The Indian businesses of the erstwhile Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) were being restructured into three separate companies to be fully-owned by Cognizant Corporation, the new Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp and AC Nielsen. This followed the reorganisation worldwide of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp into the three companies. Two new fully-owned companies would be set up in India, and the 100 percent ownership of the former D&amp;B Corporation in D&amp;B (India) transferred to Cognizant Corp. An initial investment of $5 million would be split between the three companies. The government approved setting up the two new companies and for the transfer of stake in the third.</p>

<p>Financial Express</p>
<p>BULLISH FOREIGN INVESTORS NOW TURN CAUTIOUS</p>
<p>Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) who had turned bullish on India after the budget now are cautious following the withdrawal of support to the government by the Congress party. The divestment process was likely to be disrupted. Most FII firms opined the reforms would not be destabilised, regardless of which party came to power. Until March 30, it was estimated that around $1 billion was invested in Indian stocks by international investors. Given the bullishness, an additional $500 million was expected to pour in over the next few months.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>BANKERS FEAR SLOWDOWN IN PROJECT LENDING</p>
<p>The withdrawal of Congress party support to the government was likely to slow down investments, feared bankers. This would lead to a crunch in the banking industry, which was already reeling under slow growth in non-food credit demand. All investment decisions would be shelved and corporates would adopt a wait and watch policy. Amid growing apprehensions that credit demand would show further slackness, bankers ruled out the possibility of slashing prime lending rates.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>INFLATION DOWN TO 7.65 PERCENT</p>
<p>The inflation rate fell by 0.13 percentage point to 7.65 percent for the week closing March 15. The inflation rate was 7.78 percent in the previous week. The official wholesale price index (WPI) for all commodities for the week ending March 15, 1997, stood at 322.2 (provisional) as against 322.6 (provisional) down 0.1 percent. The final WPI for all commodities for the week ending January 18 stood at 319.8 as against the index of 320.4 (provisional) on February 2. The annual rate of inflation for the week ending January 18, 1997, based on final index calculated on a point to point basis was 7.3 percent, as against 7.5 percent for the week based on provisional index.</p>

<p>Business Standard</p>
<p>NO PANIC SELLING BY FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS</p>
<p>Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were unlikely to react drastically to the political upheaval. The Bombay bourse index could slide 250-300 points over the coming two trading sessions. There would be no panic selling by the FIIs and they were not expected to unload stocks in a substantial way. The FIIs would decide on their presence in volatile trading conditions. Another key factor would be the stability of the party that would come to power. A senior official of a British-based global investment bank said the crucial issue would be the passing of the budget.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>STOCKS PLUMMET ON KERB</p>
<p>Fears of a reversal of tax reforms and uncertainty over the formation of a new government sent prices of key pivotals crashing down in one of the longest kerb sessions. Prices of key pivotals slumped by over six percent over their previous official closing levels on the Bombay bourse. Even as a sell-off was expected across the markets over the next two days, the focus would move to the National bourse (NSE). Market players expected most stocks to open at circuit filter levels at the NSE. Trading on the kerb commenced immediately as news of the withdrawal of Congress support to the government trickled in.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>RUPEE MIGHT SINK AGAINST DOLLAR</p>
<p>Bank treasury officials expected the money and foreign markets to turn volatile in the coming days in the wake of the Congress party bringing down the government. They predicted the rupee to weaken to the 36 rupee level against the dollar. However, inter-bank call rates were unlikely to react immediately, though rates would begin to inch upwards. Besides, government securities were expected to come under selling pressure leading to a drop in prices. Bank heads were worried over this as March 31 was the last day of the current fiscal when they have to draw their balance sheets.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>NEW EXPORT IMPORT POLICY TO BE UNVEILED</p>
<p>The government would unveil its new export-import (EXIM) policy as per schedule irrespective of the Congress party's withdrawal of support to the ruling front. But Pranab Mukherjee, a former finance minister belonging to the Congress party, said the government should not announce a new policy as it would be unethical at this stage. He said the government should continue with the existing policy. Manmohan Singh, who initiated the reforms program as finance minister, said it was for the government to decide whether it was right or constitutionally correct to announce a new EXIM policy.</p>

<p>The Observer</p>
<p>TELECOM COMMISSION  MEETS CELLULAR OPERATORS</p>
<p>The Telecom Commission was moving towards a deal with prospective basic and cellular service operators in the private sector. The Commission chairman held discussions with prospective basic service operators individually to learn their problems. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) would go for an interim settlement on the controversial interconnect charges. This would be fixed at 30,000 rupees per port. The final decision would be left to the Telecom Regulatory Authority. The marginal differences over the assignability clause and other points in the proposed licence and interconnect agreements would also be settled.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>TRADE CHAMBERS WORRIED OVER FATE OF BUDGET</p>
<p>The apex chambers of commerce were more worried about the fate of the proposed budget for the current financial year than the political uncertainty and prospects of mid-term polls looming over the country. Captains of industry felt the withdrawal of support by the Congress party to the United Front government would impact the industrial and economic growth adversely. Stressing the need for an early resolution of the political uncertainty, they pointed out that any political uncertainty at this crucial juncture could slow down the economic growth and erode the confidence of foreign investors in India.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>INDUSTRY FLABBERGASTED AT TURN OF EVENTS</p>
<p>The business community was shocked after the Congress party suddenly withdrew its support to the government. The industrial community was frantically trying to ascertain the fate of the budget announcements, which were pro-corporate. Captains of the industry were of the opinion that industrial growth, which had gained momentum following the corporate and investor friendly budget, would be the victim of the latest political development. Even if a Congress government heads a new coalition government, it was unlikely that the economic polices would be reversed.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Business Line</p>
<p>RAIL FREIGHT HIKE TO STAY</p>
<p>The Railway Ministry clarified the freight and fare hikes proposed in the Rail Budget would come into effect on April 1. However, the fate of the expenditure proposals, which contained sops for the Northeast and Bihar, hung in balance. Technically, the tariff proposals could be passed even without parliamentary approval as several speakers had ruled that the Railways was a service provider for which a price was charged and not taxed.</p>
