<p>European Union leaders are expected to call at their summit on Saturday for an active role in reviving the threatened Middle East peace process, French President Jacques Chirac said on Friday.</p>
<p>He said France and Italy had agreed at bilateral talks to ask their partners to issue the call at the Dublin meeting, adding: &quot;I believe that everyone will agree with it.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement would affirm &quot;the desire of Europe to take part in relaunching the peace process&quot;, Chirac told a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was due to meet separately later on Friday with Prodi in Naples and with Chirac in Paris to brief them on this week's inconclusive Washington Middle East summit.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton called the talks after five days of bloody clashes between Israelis and Palestinians. More than 70 people were killed in violence triggered by the opening of an Israeli tunnel in Jerusalem near Moslem holy sites.</p>
<p>The Washington meeting brought together the leaders of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan but had no European presence.</p>
<p>France, which has irked some of its EU partners with its own Middle East initiatives, and other European countries have been irritated by their apparent exclusion from U.S.-driven efforts while footing the bill for economic aid in the region.</p>
<p>Chirac said Saturday's statement would stress the need for a European role &quot;in the face of the intolerance and hatred which has seemed to want to regain the upper hand in this region&quot;.</p>
<p>It would also refer to the &quot;considerable&quot; financial effort Europe was making, including aid and reconstruction help for the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>The special Dublin summit has been called to discuss the EU's own workings.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said it was for EU leaders to make clear their views on how the Middle East peace process should be conducted.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important in the light of recent developments that the heads of state and government...give a sense of direction and (express) the way they think this process should go,&quot; Dini told Reuters.</p>
