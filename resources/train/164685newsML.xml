<p>Despite political instability and stunted prospects for Arab-Israeli peace, the Middle East shows signs of a modest economic upturn, according to the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>The region's disparate economies could double growth this year to an average four percent and post the lowest inflation this decade.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1996 growth will be twice what it was between 1993 and 1995,&quot; Mohamed El-Erian, deputy director of the Fund's Middle Eastern Department said.</p>
<p>Regional gross domestic product growth averaged two per cent in those years.</p>
<p>El-Erian was speaking ahead of the third Middle East and North Africa (MENA) summit in Cairo next week where the IMF will present a study on economic prospects and reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Nineteen-ninety-six will be the first year of positive per capita growth since 1992,&quot; El-Erian said in an interview with Reuters and the Middle East News Agency.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation is the lowest this decade,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the unexploited emerging market...the best proof of that is the rush by Moody's to rate these countries,&quot; he added, referring to the credit ratings published by the U.S. firm.</p>
<p>El-Erian acknowledged that he was looking at the half-full rather than the half-empty glass in a region plagued by war, political oppression, economic mismanagement and corruption.</p>
<p>MENA runs from the Atlantic to the borders of Pakistan, comprising the economies of the Arab League, Israel and Iran.</p>
<p>Despite its oil wealth the region is slipping down the growth tables to sub-Saharan African levels while its population soars at an average three percent a year.</p>
<p>The MENA summits were set up after the 1993 Israel-PLO agreement on Palestinian self-rule, to give an economic underpinning to peace. But that accord and the whole Arab-Israeli peace drive has stalled.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes there are uncertainties but there is also potential,&quot; El-Erian said. He said the region had suffered from &quot;an information failure&quot; prompting some investors to lump all MENA countries together and dismiss them, just like some investors had done with Latin America in the 1980s. The Middle East had untapped resources and skills, he said.</p>
<p>He said the non-oil countries Tunisia and Jordan, which had adopted IMF structural reforms, had averaged growth of four percent and six percent respectively between 1990 and 1995.</p>
<p>Egypt had slashed its fiscal deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP from 20 percent since 1991, and turnover on the Cairo stock market in the first nine months of 1996 was bigger than the past five years combined.</p>
<p>He said many countries were following Israel, Tunisia and Morocco in negotiating trade agreements with the European Union, a commitment to liberalising trade and investment policies.</p>
<p>Yet the region needs faster and more sweeping economic, fiscal and monetary reform if it is to attract the private sector investment that the IMF sees as an engine of growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The Middle East lags behind in trade liberalisation. This has had a negative impact on growth and foreign investment and on consumers who have low-quality and high-priced goods,&quot; El-Erian said.</p>
<p>Without radical economic change the global economy could pass the Middle East by.</p>
<p>&quot;The region risks being marginalised,&quot; he said.</p>
