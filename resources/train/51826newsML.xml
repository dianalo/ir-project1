<p>Lech Walesa, who discussed Poland's EU and NATO aspirations with French President Jacques Chirac on Friday, warmly praised him as a rare politician who, when in power, kept promises he made in opposition.</p>
<p>But the former Polish president, concerned over Chirac's stress on reassuring Russia over planned expansion of the Western defence pact, urged him to take firm, &quot;manly decisions&quot; on securing Poland's admission.</p>
<p>Walesa, who led the Solidarity union to its 1989 victory over communism, welcomed Chirac's assurances in Warsaw of French backing for Poland's key foreign policy goals of entry into both the EU and NATO.</p>
<p>&quot;I discussed such matters with Mr Chirac when he was still in opposition, and I am impressed that as president he is keeping to his word and acting on it. This rarely happens,&quot; Walesa said after the half-hour meeting in a Warsaw hotel.</p>
<p>On Thursday Chirac told parliament in Warsaw that he hoped Poland would be in the European Union by the year 2000 -- widely seen as an optimistic date.</p>
<p>Chirac also backed its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) although he emphasised the need to avoid humiliating Russia or renewing divisions across Europe.</p>
<p>In this context, Chirac called for a summit on NATO which would involve the 16 existing members, candidate states from the former Soviet bloc, and other states including Russia.</p>
<p>Walesa, a militant advocate of NATO membership during his presidency which ended in his election defeat by ex-communist Aleksander Kwasniewski last year, has long sought full, fast Polish entry, unqualified by compromise with Russia.</p>
<p>He said he told Chirac it was important to neither humiliate nor indulge Russia -- which opposes NATO expansion as a threat to its security.</p>
<p>&quot;On NATO, manly decisions are needed -- which do not humiliate anyone or cause divisions in Europe -- but are manly,&quot; said the former shipyard electrician, who remains a prominent voice in Poland's opposition.</p>
<p>After meeting Walesa Chirac flew to the historic southern city of Krakow, for the last leg of his three-day Polish visit -- his first as president to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The French leader was applauded by several thousand well-wishers as he strolled round Krakow's main square in the rain -- local flower sellers gave him a bouquet and youngsters regaled him with French folk songs.</p>
<p>Before returning to Paris, Chirac was due to visit the former Auschwitz death camp, where World War Two German invaders murdered up to 1.5 million people -- most of them Jews brought from around Europe including France. -- Anthony Barker +48 22 653 9700</p>
