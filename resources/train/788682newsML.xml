<p>A key aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted on Friday as saying he opposed Israel's &quot;sucking up&quot; to Arabs.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, it's no secret that I do not like to chase after and suck up to the Arabs, including the Jordanians, including the Egyptians, including all of them,&quot; Avigdor Lieberman, director general of Netanyahu's office, told the newspaper Maariv.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to protect our own honour. If something annoys me sometimes, it's that I feel humiliated, from the point of view of national honour, around this running after and this sucking up to the Arabs,&quot; he told the Israeli daily in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not inferior to anyone in the Middle East.&quot;</p>
<p>The Russian-born Lieberman made the comments when asked why he made sure not to be around during the visit of Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan to Israel on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The prince was on a mission to save Middle East peacemaking, battered by a suicide attack on an Israeli market that killed two bombers and 13 other people and by Israel's groundbreaking in March for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Lieberman said, for example, that while Israeli officials crowded Egypt's embassy to celebrate the Egyptian independence day, Egyptians would not do the same on Israel's national day.</p>
<p>Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab states to have peace treaties with Israel.</p>
<p>The burly Lieberman said that he was proud of his right-wing credentials and that he had no disagreements with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&quot;I've already said a number of times that right of me is only a wall...I am here, among other things, because our red line is shared. The prime minister set it and it is acceptable to me,&quot; Lieberman said.</p>
