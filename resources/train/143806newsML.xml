<title>USA: National carlot beef trade weekly review - USDA.</title>
<headline>National carlot beef trade weekly review - USDA.</headline>
<dateline>DES MOINES 1996-10-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Boxed beef trading was generally weak on moderate demand and mostly moderate offerings the week ended Thursday, USDA said.</p>
<p>Retail and HRI demand was fairly good for immediate needs, while good forward interest was noted on rib cuts. Light export demand continues to suppress the domestic market.</p>
<p>Round and most loin cuts trended lower throughout the trading period as processors were forced to control inventories on these cuts. Choice chuck cuts struggled to maintain steady levels, while Select chuck cuts trended lower as these cuts were more abundant.  </p>
<p>Rib cuts traded higher on good demand and offerings were rather light especially on the Choice product. Closely trimmed items traded uneven on moderate demand as Choice cuts were generally steady, while Select cuts trended lower.</p>
<p>Beef trimmings traded sharply lower on light to moderate demand and fairly heavy offerings. Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items were generally steady on moderate demand and offerings.</p>
<p>For the week - Select and Choice rib primal 2.00 to 3.00 higher; Select and Choice chuck primal steady to 2.00 lower; Select and Choice round primal 1.50 to 2.00 lower; Select and Choice loin primal 1.00 to 2.50 lower; Closely trimmed items steady to 1.00 lower; Beef trimmings 4.50 lower; Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items generally steady.</p>
<p>The Estimated Composite of Boxed Beef Cutout values of Choice 1-3 550/700 carcasses Dn 0.62 at 106.71; 700/850 Dn 1.08 at 104.38; Select 1-3 550/700 carcasses Dn 1.22 at 98.17; 700/850 Dn .90 at 96.39.</p>
