<p>California rock group No Doubt will try to enter the record books next week in an event organizers are dubbing the world's biggest &quot;virtual&quot; public appearance by a band.</p>
<p>The Grammy-nominated group will use satellites and two-way video technology to perform and talk with fans on three continents on Tuesday. The event will also be broadcast live over the Internet and on Canadian video channel MuchMusic.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be the world's biggest 'virtual' public appearance by a band,&quot; said Rob Goldstone, head of international marketing with HMV Record Stores. &quot;I think personally this is the way of the future.&quot;</p>
<p>The event -- which is expected to cost more than $250,000 -- is being sponsored by HMV, a division of EMI Group Plc, as well as Seagram Co.'s Universal Music unit and CHUM Ltd.'s MuchMusic.</p>
<p>The event will originate in Toronto, with No Doubt performing in MuchMusic's &quot;Intimate and Interactive&quot; showcase. The program is similar to MTV's Unplugged series, except that artists take breaks between songs in order to field questions from fans.</p>
<p>For the No Doubt performance, the format has been expanded using satellite technology, so fans at HMV stores in Toronto, New York, Sydney, Australia and Singapore will see and be seen by the band and can ask live questions. HMV officials said they expected at least 10,000 fans to gather at the four sites.</p>
<p>Goldstone said HMV had spoken with the producers of the Guinness Book of World Records and were hoping the event would be included in next year's edition in a new catagory for &quot;virtual&quot; public appearances.</p>
<p>MuchMusic will broadcast the event live on its video channel in Canada and the United States, where it is available in 15 million households. The station is also making the show available over the Internet through its website and was preparing for &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of hits.</p>
<p>&quot;It is way bigger than (what) we've ever attempted before but it's not untried territory,&quot; said Denise Donlon, director of music programming with MuchMusic. &quot;If anybody can pull it off I think we can.&quot;</p>
<p>No Doubt, who this year was nominated for a Grammy for best new artist, has sold more than 10 million copies of its &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; album.</p>
