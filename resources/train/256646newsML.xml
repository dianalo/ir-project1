<p>The Oslo Bourse will extend trading hours by one hour from March 3 in the hope of attracting more foreign investors.</p>
<p>Bourse director Kjell Froensdal, explaining the decision in a speech on Thursday night, said the bourse was worried it was losing business to the Stockholm, London and New York exchanges by closing at 4 p.m. (1500 GMT) -- a time when the competing markets are open for trading.</p>
<p>The Norwegian stock exchange, one of the smallest in Europe, recently decided to extend opening hours by one hour to 5 p.m.(1600 GMT). Simultaneously, bond market dealing will be extended by one hour to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>The decision was made over the objections of brokers, who complain about long hours already. The bourse opens at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;We hear what the brokers say, but we want to try something,&quot; Froensdal said. &quot;If we don't improve business we won't keep people in the office for an extra hour.&quot;</p>
<p>Big Norwegian companies such as Norsk Hydro ASA and Kvaerner ASA are traded on several foreign bourses as well as in Oslo.</p>
<p>Froensdal said it was important to stay tuned to the needs of foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a marginal market to many foreign investors,&quot; Froensdal said. &quot;They can leave here, but if they left the British or American markets they might as well drop out of stocks entirely.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign investments, including British and U.S. pension funds, now represent about 35 percent of the market value of Norway's bourse stock, up from 21 percent 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Froensdal stressed the need for closer cooperation between the Nordic stock exchanges to increase economy and enhance foreign investors' focus on Oslo as well as on Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen.</p>
<p>&quot;So why would we need a joint Nordic bourse?&quot; he asked. &quot;We are doing fine here in Oslo.</p>
<p>&quot;But investors are looking for liquidity. It is also becoming more and more expensive for a small bourse like the one in Oslo to keep up with technological development.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the Oslo Bourse had been a pioneer in promoting cross-border trading in equity derivatives. A year ago the bourse and the Norwegian Futures and Options Clearing House agreed to set up a link with the Swedish derivatives exchange OM and its London equivalent OMLX.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a good record (in cooperation),&quot; Froensdal said.</p>
<p>The system, under which foreigners will be able to trade in Oslo derivatives via London and Stockholm, goes into operation on February 14. Oslo handles only 6,000 contracts a day to make it one of Europe's smallest derivatives markets.</p>
