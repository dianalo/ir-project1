<headline>LIFFE cocoa trims gains, sterling rises again.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>LIFFE cocoa futures trimmed some gains to end Wednesday midsession higher but near session's floor after early buying dried up, traders said.</p>
<p>The market came under pressure towards the close from buoyant sterling. The British unit eclipsed Tuesday's six-year high to reach a fresh peak at 2.9760 marks.</p>
<p>The sterling denominated futures had a sluggish start but the momentum soon picked up as light buying re-emerged.</p>
<p>Benchmark September was driven to a high of 1,053 stg a tonne but ended just three stg up at 1,046.</p>
<p>Despite the late pull-back, traders said the market's outlook remained constructive.</p>
<p>Overall, the market did well on Tuesday despite soaring sterling.</p>
<p>Immediately, the market could easily breach its minor target at 1,060 before attempting to conquer the next barrier at the 1,087-1,108 chart gap basis September.</p>
<p>Support is seen intact at 1,000, the lows seen last week after the blistering rally that pushed values to one-year peak of 1,170 stg a few days earlier.</p>
<p>Since then, the market had been struggling to return to the 1,060 area and ultimately the key 1,100 resistance.</p>
<p>But traders said recent volatility was purely technical and had not altered the positive fundamental picture.</p>
<p>Broker GNI said overnight news from Abidjan which put Ivorian cocoa arrivals at 1.05-1.06 million tonnes up to July 4 against 1.148 million last year could be viewed by some as a sign of lower supply.</p>
<p>&quot;But this ignores the fact that virtually no mid-crop cocoa has yet been delivered,&quot; it said in a commentary.</p>
