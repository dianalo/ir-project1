<title>BELGIUM: Belgians lobby court over child sex abuse case.</title>
<headline>Belgians lobby court over child sex abuse case.</headline>

<text>
<p>More than 5,000 people demonstrated across Belgium on Sunday in favour of a judge and an examining magistrate who face removal from a case of child sex abuse and murder which has scandalised the country.</p>
<p>About 1,000 gathered outside the country's highest court, the Cour de Cassation, in Brussels and handed in a petition signed by 300,000 people in support for the two men, whose impartiality has been questioned by the defence.</p>
<p>Belgians have been profoundly shocked by the discovery of a paedophile ring believed responsible for the deaths of several children. About 2,000 people demonstrated in Antwerp in favour of the two men and smaller rallies were held elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Cour de Cassation must rule on Monday on whether magistrate Jean-Marc Connerotte and public prosecutor Michel Borlet should be removed from the inquiry into the paedophile ring because they accepted a free meal.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers for one of the chief suspects say they compromised their impartiality by accepting the dinner from the Marc and Corinne group, set up to help grieving parents and protect children.</p>
<p>The two investigators have won enormous public support for their inquiry after the discovery in August of the bodies of two eight-year-old girls followed a few weeks later by the discovery of the bodies of two teenagers.</p>
<p>Cars arriving for the demonstrations sported placards reading &quot;Connerotte and no one else.&quot;</p>
