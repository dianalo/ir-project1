<headline>Volvo Trucks seen making U.S. purchase.</headline>

<p>Volvo Trucks is seeking to acquire a rival in the North American market in its bid for world leadership in heavy truck production, analysts say.</p>
<p>They said the truckmaker is analysing possible candidates for a takeover -- and most fingers point to Allentown, Pa.-baed Mack Trucks Inc., which is owned by French automaker Renault SA.</p>
<p>&quot;They are most certainly looking to buy something in the North American market,&quot; said Hans Westerberg, analyst at Den Danske Bank (DDB).</p>
<p>&quot;Karl-Erling Trogen (chief executive officer of Volvo Trucks) has clearly spelled out that an acquisition is in order to strengthen the company's market position in North America,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Volvo Trucks declined to comment directly.</p>
<p>&quot;There is currently restructuring going on in the truck production industry, and Volvo Trucks is, of course, playing a part in that,&quot; spokesman Stefan Lorentzson said in an interview. &quot;Internally, we work with a lot of different scenarios, but, of course, we won't give detailed comment about them.&quot;</p>
<p>Volvo Group CEO Leif Johansson has not ruled out the possibility of a North American acquisition, and his stated intention is for Volvo Trucks to become the world's leading heavy truck producer by 2005.</p>
<p>&quot;Johansson has pointed out that an acquisition of some sort is on its way and that it will be significant,&quot; said John Lawson at Salomon Brothers in London. &quot;I still think, however, that he will want to wait a couple of quarters after his recent appointment before he is ready to close a big deal.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts say North America is a target for Volvo because its domestic truck industry is not large enough to supply the market on a long-term basis.</p>
<p>A purchase would give Volvo access to a wider sales and distribution network, which would enable it to grow in an important and profitable market.</p>
<p>&quot;In the long run, Volvo Trucks isn't large enough in North America,&quot; said Lawson. &quot;The problem is, however, that there are no truck producers to buy.&quot;</p>
<p>Although Mack is seen as the most likely candidate, other possible targets include Paccar Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., and Chicago-based Navistar International Corp., analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The most probable acquisition is Mack. But it's all down to timing ... whichever board of directors decides to leave the heavy truck market in North America next,&quot; DDB's Hans Westerberg said.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt whether Renault will sell Mack on its own. What might happen is that it looks to find a partnership solution for its European truck operation, and sells Mack in that package,&quot; said Philippe Barrier, analyst at Societe Generale in Paris.</p>
