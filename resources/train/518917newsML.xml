<p>Cultus Petroleum NL is on target to become a major oil and gas producer over the next few years with profits expected to climb accordingly, managing director Don Beard said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Beard told Reuters in a telephone interview from Sydney that Cultus planned to spud several wildcat -- high risk/high return -- oil wells in the near future which could see a &quot;quantum leap&quot; in the company's oil and gas production.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to be a totally different company,&quot; Beard said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given success with these things, profits are going to increase substantially.&quot;  </p>
<p>Cultus posted a net profit of A$3.43 million for the six months to December 31, which included a $4.18 million abnormal debit. Beard said he expected Cultus to be more than double its first half profit in the second half.</p>
<p>&quot;Our profit would have been close to the best it has been had those abnormals not occurred, so we'd expect the second half to be better than that. We'd be hopeful of doubling that at least in the second half,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Beard expected the company's market capitalisation to breach A$1 billion &quot;in the the next couple of years&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the wildcat wells to be spudded shortly was in the Bonaparte Basin, on the offshore boundary of the Northern Territory in Western Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a potential there for a few hundred million barrels or more of oil,&quot; Beard said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's in an area where oil has been already discovered, although not commercially, so it's in a good hunting ground and we'll probably spud that in perhaps July of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;If that were to be successful, that certainly would change the face of Cultus.&quot;  </p>
<p>Beard said the company planned to start drilling its Maari oilfield, offshore Taranaki in New Zealand, in November or December, depending on the availability of rigs.</p>
<p>He said the Maari field had the potential to produce 100 million barrels of oil, making it one of the largest oilfields in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Cultus was in the process of farming out 70 percent of the Maari investment to a major international company which would cover the drilling costs of the first one or two wells.</p>
<p>Beard declined to name the company but said the agreement would be announced within a month.</p>
<p>Cultus has a 25 percent interest in the WA-241-P Cornea field in the Browse Basin, offshore Western Australia, which analysts say could hold up to 500 million barrels of oil.</p>
<p>&quot;We see enormous potential up in Cornea,&quot; Beard said.</p>
<p>&quot;We know we've got an oil column of 20 metres plus, we believe it could be as large as 60 metres through the testing we've done there, and that of course indicates that this could be a very, very large feature.&quot;</p>
<p>Beard said Cultus was confident of securing more exploration blocks in the area, which could double prospective production.</p>
<p>Cultus also has an interest in the Hutton field in the North Sea which would provide it with cash flow to fund other exploration.</p>
<p>&quot;We purchased a cash flow there that's going to be producing something like A$14 million worth of revenue annually for a $3-4 million profit, so that's not too bad and they're the sorts of funds that we can use to drill the wildcats,&quot; Beard said.</p>
<p>He said an exploration block in the Timor Sea, offered to a consortium of companies led by Cultus, would be accepted.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll accept it. It's got a couple of nice plays in there.&quot;</p>
<p>Cultus, listed in Australia and New Zealand, has seen its share price rise by more than 600 percent over the past year on oil and gas discoveries and the propect of more.</p>
<p>Beard said the shares were not over-rated at A$2.94 and NZ$3.15 and he expected them to rise further in due course.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a fairly complex business and it is a business that takes enormous risks, but people seem to like it,&quot; he said.</p>
