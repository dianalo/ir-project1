<p>Singapore stocks ended broadly firmer in robust trade on Wednesday as retail investors mopped up small-capitalised shares, dealers said.</p>
<p>The small-capitalised stocks included paper maker New Toyo, machine tool maker Excel Machine and healthcare group Raffles Medical. All of which touched new year highs.</p>
<p>New Toyo hit Singapore $0.955 before ending up S$0.055 cents at S$0.95, while Excel hit S$0.78 before settling at S$0.775, up three cents. Speculation that Raffles could be a potential takeover candidate fuelled it to a new high of S$1.01 before it ended at S$0.98, up seven cents.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrials Index ended 17.52 points down at 2,023.86, dampened by car retailer Cycle &amp; Carriage. The issue ended 30 cents lower at S$14.80.</p>
<p>Infrastructure firm Van der Horst led the actives with over 25 million shares traded as investors were drawn in by its earnings prospects. It ended 21 cents up at S$2.48.</p>
<p>Banks were among gainers after the Monetary Authority of Singapore said on Tuesday prospects for financial services remain bright. DBS Foreign ended 50 cents up at S$18.50.</p>
<p>Total market volume was an active 180.8 million shares with 256 gainers to 117 losers.</p>
