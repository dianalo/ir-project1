<headline>Begemann starts B-share listing procedure.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-01-30</dateline>

<p>Industrial investment firm Royal Begemann Groep NV is free to begin listing procedures on the Amsterdam bourse for its controversial B-shares, a spokesman for the Amsterdam stock exchange said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Begemann wants to set up the shares, which it has called &quot;certificates of justice&quot;, to give investors the chance to benefit should it win its damages claim against the government and stock exchange in the aftermath of an insider trading case.</p>
<p>The company last June said it would claim 900 million guilders in damages relating to the failed insider dealing charges against its former chief Joep van den Nieuwenhuyzen.</p>
<p>Former Begemann chairman Van den Nieuwenhuyzen was acquitted last year of insider trading in the so-called HCS affair. He has laid a separate 300 million guilder claim for the personal damage he suffered during the affair.</p>
<p>&quot;The B-shares were created as part of the Bega-claim against the government and the Amsterdam stock exchange because of the affair which took place regarding Mr. Van den Nieuwenhuyzen,&quot; Begemann spokeswoman Wilke van Thiel said.</p>
<p>&quot;These shares give the shareholders the right to money arising from the claims,&quot; she said. &quot;If there's money paid on these claims then it goes directly to the shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>Van Thiel said shareholders would be entitled to one B-share for every existing share they held as a retrospective interim dividend payment. The company paid no interim dividend when it reported a first half net profit of 14.2 million guilders in September.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam stock exchange spokesman declined to comment on the nature of the new B-shares but said Begemann could now prepare a prospectus for bourse approval. Van Thiel said she expected a prospectus could be submitted within two months.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed with Begemann to start the formal procedure to come to a listing,&quot; the exchange spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said further questions would need to be answered before a listing could be finalised. &quot;What exactly are the assets of this stock? Is it an empty shell or is it real?&quot;</p>
<p>Van Thiel said Begemann was still preparing its damages case. &quot;We're working on the case but we don't know when it will be presented, it could take years,&quot; she said.</p>
