<p>The Budapest Stock Exchange closed higher in thin turnover on Monday bolstered by gains in some heavy-weight stocks but analysts believed the market was directionless.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very quiet market, there's not a lot of direction on the market and...people are really adopting a sort of balanced position on the market at the moment,&quot; said Stephen O'Sullivan, analyst at MC-BBL in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a lot of new money coming in, not much redemptions.&quot;</p>
<p>The BUX index finished at 5,398.69 points, up 83.23. BUX futures closed higher for all maturities, rising by between 118.00 points and 237.50 points. June BUX ended at 5,720.50 points, up 118.00.</p>
<p>Spot share turnover totalled a meagre 1.39 billion forints.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess one of the problems we see at the moment is typically the turnover on the markets, all are very low across the whole of eastern Europe and Russia,&quot; O'Sullivan said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not a lot of buying interest, there is not a lot of selling interest either, particularly on the Russian market and that feeds through to eastern Europe as well.&quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the chemicals, OTP Bank and pharmaceuticals Richter were the main driving force behind the rise of the index.</p>
<p>TVK gained 75 forints to end at 2,375 with some foreign buying, while Borsodchem gained 180 forints to end at 6,380. OTP Bank rose 100 forints to finish at 3,990, while Richter added 390 forints to 11,450.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts were divided over the market's short-term outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not accidental that investors bought heavily in December and January, I expect this to continue sometime as the market has been standstill for quite a while,&quot; said Laszlo Baranyai of Gog Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the market might perhaps benefit from part of the capital which turns away from the Czech market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But O'Sullivan had a different view.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people are now waiting perhaps to see changes in earnings growth and see whether it will stimulate new money.&quot;</p>
