<p>Florida's Dade County tentatively agreed Friday to give the City of Miami $12.6 million in cash from the Miami Sports and Exhibition Authority.</p>
<p>&quot;The city of Miami desperately needs the money,&quot; Miami City Manager Ed Marquez told the county's finance and trust funds committee.</p>
<p>The authority's board had already agreed to the plan. Dade's finance committee approved it Friday and sent it on to the full county commission for a vote on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The donation still requires approval from the state oversight board appointed by Gov. Lawton Chiles to help Miami end its $68 million budget deficit for the year that began Oct 1.</p>
<p>The city sports authority receives a share of revenues from the county's convention development taxes. Miami asked that it be allowed to spend the $12.6 million of that money currently held by the authority.</p>
<p>By law, the money must be spent on projects related to tourism and conventions. Miami can meet that requirement by spending the money on capital and operating expenses for the Miami Convention Center, Coconut Grove Exhibition Center and Orange Bowl Stadium, freeing up general fund revenues for other uses.</p>
<p>Miami is the Dade County seat. In light of Miami's deficit, county commissioners asked County Manager Armando Vidal for an update on Dade's financial situation.</p>
<p>Vidal reported that the county's budget has always been balanced, its general fund balance has progressively increased over the past 10 years, and ad valorem property assessments had an average annual growth rate of 4.1 percent over the past decade.</p>
<p>Vidal said the county was &quot;one of the most financially stable county governments in Florida&quot; and its bonds &quot;receive a strong reception in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>Dade general obligation bonds are rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that we're fiscally healthy,&quot; Assistant County Manager David Morris told the finance committe.</p>
