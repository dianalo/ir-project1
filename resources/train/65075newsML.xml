<p>The controversial chairman of British sportscar maker and auto engineer Lotus Group, Romano Artioli, has promised to announce a new partner for the company &quot;within days&quot;, a company spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Public relations manager Alastair Florance told Reuters the partner's identity was not yet being revealed and he declined to comment on news reports it was Korea's Daewoo Motor Co.</p>
<p>Armed with plans to boost production of the newly-launched lightweight Elise roadster, Artioli told a staff briefing earlier this week that a deal was near, Florance explained.</p>
<p>&quot;He said to the staff that he has found a partner...and in the next few days we will have cause for celebration.</p>
<p>&quot;He did not tell them who the partner is,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>There has been extended uncertainty over Lotus' ownership since last year, when Italian car company Bugatti Automobili -- like Lotus owned by Artioli-controlled, Luxembourg-registered Bugatti International SA -- went into receivership.</p>
<p>Matters came to a head during this summer when local management tried to force Artioli's hand and sell the firm before it hit liquidity problems, but found themselves ousted.</p>
<p>The chairman has since been running the company at its Norfolk headquarters in eastern England and is now making the same promise his previous directors made two months ago.</p>
<p>In July, the British directors said they were close enough to a deal to see one being announced by the end of that month.</p>
<p>Instead they found themselves with neither jobs nor a deal.</p>
<p>Daewoo Motor, part of South Korean industrial conglomerate, or chaebol', Daewoo Group, has made no comment during a period of widespread industry and media speculation throughout this year that it may link up with Lotus.</p>
<p>It has been the most frequently-named potential partner in the trade press, closely followed by a British engineering consortium led by former racing driver Brian Henton.</p>
<p>Other names in the frame, all unconfirmed as suitors, have included British auto engineering and design group Mayflower its U.S. aluminium supplier Alcoa, engineering consultant Ricardo and Britain's Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR).</p>
<p>Despite the constant speculation that he is about to cut and run from his connection with Lotus after just three years as an owner, Artioli confirmed this week he planned to make more cars.</p>
<p>According to Florance, the Italian chairman told employees that an extended agreement with chassis supplier Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk Hydro ASA of Norway, meant the Elise production could be raised to a rate of over 2,500 a year.</p>
<p>During the summer deliveries have started of the cars that retail at 20,000 pounds ($31,180) each.</p>
<p>The previous plan was to produce just 750 of these cars a year but Florance said the decision to boost output was because deposits have been received for more than 2,000 cars.</p>
<p>Most of Lotus's 1,100 employees work in its engineering consultancy side and only about 300 people manufacture its cars, which include the evergreen Esprit in new turbo V8 guise.</p>
<p>In its last financial year the group made a pretax profit of about 4.5 million pounds on sales of 67 million.</p>
