<headline>Change brewing for Japan's public financial bodies.</headline>

<p>Japan must reform its public financial institutions as they are taking business away from the private sector and are a drain on public money, government officials and analysts say.</p>
<p>They say these institutions have ventured into areas beyond their originally stated purpose and should be privatised or even abolished to ease the government's burgeoning fiscal deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;The financial markets will undergo a huge change under the 'Big Bang' reforms... Taking into account the changes in the economic situation, we plan to conduct a review of government- affiliated financial institutions,&quot; said Hakuo Yanagisawa, secretary-general of an administrative reform panel of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).</p>
<p>He told Reuters in an interview the LDP would seek to abolish or privatise as many of those institutions as possible.</p>
<p>Koko Sato, the panel's chairman, said a reform plan would be unveiled by the LDP in early May.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with these financial bodies is that they are taking business away from the private sector, said Akihiko Noda, an economist at Fuji Research Institute Corp.</p>
<p>Unlike the period after World War Two, when the private sector was unable to meet demand for funds and government-affiliated bodies were set up to fill that void, private banks are now capable of supplying ample funds, Noda said.</p>
<p>Government-affiliated financial bodies receive loans from the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme (FILP), which collects funds mainly through postal savings and public pension systems and then funnels them to government agencies.</p>
<p>According to the Bank of Japan, the total outstanding loans of government-affiliated financial institutions, which include two banks and nine finance corporations, were worth 137.89 trillion yen as of end-December 1996.</p>
<p>If government-affiliated financial bodies are privatised, the government will gain revenues by selling shares and the proceeds can be used to help cut the fiscal deficit, Noda said.</p>
<p>Efforts to reform government-affiliated financial institutions and the FILP as a whole have gained momentum recently as awareness of the need for fiscal reform has grown, said Kunji Okue, an economist at the research department of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;Reform efforts by the (Prime Minister Ryutaro) Hashimoto cabinet were all prompted by the seriousness of the fiscal deficit,&quot; Okue said.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the nation's debt from ballooning further, the government must dispose of problem loans held by government-affiliated agencies, Okue said.</p>
<p>&quot;Government-affiliated financial institutions have few assets and cannot dispose of their problem loans by selling them,&quot; Okue said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even merging and restructuring such organisations and reducing the number of workers will not be that effective at reducing their problem loans,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government should think about setting up a public trust fund to get rid of the bad loans at government-affiliated agencies, similar to the one set up to resolve the bad debt problems of failed mortgage companies, Okue said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka has said that Japan's government-affiliated financial institutions had a total of 869.2 billion yen worth of loans whose interest payments were in arrears by six months or longer as of March 31 last year.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said loans that were in arrears accounted for 0.76 percent of the outstanding loans of government-affiliated financial institutions.</p>
