<headline>ANTEC sees &quot;substantial&quot; Q1 charge.</headline>

<p>ANTEC Corp said Friday it expects to take a &quot;substantial&quot; integration charge in the first quarter related to its planned merger with TSX Corp.</p>
<p>On Thursday, ANTEC and TSX said their shareholders approved a merger that would leave ANTEC as the surviving entity in a deal valued at $195.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It is anticipated that we will take a substantial integration charge in the first quarter of 1997 in connection with the consolidation of TSX into ANTEC...,&quot; John Egan, chairman, said in a statement.  </p>
<p>While the amount of the charge has not been quantified as yet, he added, &quot;Our goal is to make changes which will reduce our combined expenses by as much as 10 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This merger provides opportunity to become more competitive as we eliminate duplicative functions in the combined entity and seize operational and logistical effiencies,&quot; Egan said.</p>
<p>ANTEC reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.08 a share, down from $0.12 a year ago. For the year, it earned $0.59 a share, including a gain of $0.10 from the sale of distribution operations in Canada.  </p>
<p>In 1995, it had a loss of $0.16 a share after a non-recurring charge of $21.7 million.  Excluding items, ANTEC earned $0.49 a share in 1999, up from 1995 earnings of $0.42.</p>
<p>Gross profit improved to 26.9 percent in the fourth quarter from 21.9 percent in the 1995 period.  For the year, gross profit rose to 24.5 percent, a gain of 1.1 points.</p>
<p>Sales dropped to $121.3 million for the fourth quarter, from $168.5 million a year ago, and to $604.4 million for the year, from $658.2 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;The sales decline resulted from the de-emphasis on certain low margin products, primarily in our Telewire distribution business, as well as the expected year over year absence of our Canadian distribution business,&quot; Egan said. &quot;In addition, we were very disappointed in the abrupt decline in TCI (Tele-Communications Inc ) sales that resulted from their unexpected announcement of a capital spending reduction program.&quot;</p>
<p>TCI, a large cable television operator in the United States, now accounts for about 19 to 20 percent of ANTEC's sales, down from as much as 43 percent in some quarters two or three years ago, Jim Bauer, senior vice president of administration, told Reuters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, ANTEC's percent of international sales have risen to about 23 percent of total sales currently, from three or four percent a few years ago, Bauer added.</p>
