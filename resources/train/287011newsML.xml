<p>Cambodian police used fire hoses on Saturday in an attempt to disperse hundreds of protesting garment workers in the capital, injuring at least 12 people and taking two bystanders into custody, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The break-up of the four-hour protest, which began at Tack Fat Garments and moved to central Phnom Penh, was the first police intervention in recent unrest by garment workers who have held seven demonstrations in the past three weeks.</p>
<p>Led by Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who recently helped form a garmet workers union, about 500 workers demonstrated outside factory gates early on Saturday.</p>
<p>Newly-elected factory worker representatives held talks with managers in an attempt to secure an improved pay package, reduced working hours and better working conditions.</p>
<p>Two male bystanders accused of trying to incite a riot were detained at a nearby police station for questioning, police said.</p>
<p>Workers then marched towards to city centre where they were met by armed police and three fire trucks. Firemen turned three hoses on the demonstrators, knocking down several female workers, Sam Rainsy and a cameraman, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Some protesters suffered cuts and bruises, they added.</p>
<p>About 10 other female workers were slapped or struck by police, said one garment worker. She said a policeman hit her with a rifle butt on the back of the head.</p>
<p>Chief of penal police Mok Chito said police used the hoses to try to subdue the protest, which he said was illegal.</p>
<p>The march ended at Independence Monument in a city centre traffic circle where Sam Rainsy and Chea Soeun, an adviser to managers at the factory, agreed to meet later in the day. About 100 police and six fire trucks ringed the circle.</p>
<p>Human rights workers said the rising labour unrest, which follows the formation of Cambodia's first-ever trade union in December, marked the beginning of a modern labour movement.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time in Cambodia that workers are organising democratic demonstrations. They now understand the definition of human rights,&quot; said one human rights worker.</p>
<p>However, late last month Ministry of Interior officials proposed regulations that could be used to crack down on demonstrators.</p>
<p>The garment industry is one of Cambodia's fastest growing sectors, employing about 16,000 workers at about 34 factories, according to the Industry Ministry.</p>
<p>Van Sou Ieng, chief of the Cambodian Garment Manufacturers' Association, has said labour unrest was scaring off investors.</p>
