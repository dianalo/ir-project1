<title>MALAYSIA: Briton in Malaysia custody case given visit rights.</title>
<headline>Briton in Malaysia custody case given visit rights.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>A British woman embroiled in a child custody battle with her estranged Malaysian husband obtained on Tuesday a Moslem court order that permits her to visit her son without interference from the father.</p>
<p>Jane Brummit, also known by her Moslem name of Aishah Jane Abdullah, alleged that Ismail Ariffin physically abused her recently when she visited their 20-month-old son, Sunni Sazali, the national Bernama news agency reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Brummit was granted the order by a Syariah Court in northern Penang state, where the couple were married in 1994 and had lived before their break-up. Ismail was not represented by counsel in the court, Bernama said.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Briton from Winchester, who converted to Islam, filed an application for a divorce from Ismail on December 3 after he travelled to Britain in October and brought their son back to Malaysia.</p>
<p>She is also seeking custody of Sunni, who is currently being cared for by Ismail's family in Penang.</p>
<p>Ahmad Munawir Abdul Aziz, Brummit's lawyer, told reporters on Tuesday that the court gave Ismail, 29, a month to reply and fixed March 4 for submissions from both parties.</p>
<p>Brummit said that as Sunni was now under the care of Ismail's family, the court had ordered that the child remain there pending the outcome of the case, Bernama said.</p>
<p>Ismail, a freelance artist, had accused Brummit and her mother of taking Sunni to England via Thailand without his knowledge in March this year.</p>
