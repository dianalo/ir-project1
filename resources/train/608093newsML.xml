<p>The Indian government hopes to gain transit rights for its citizens through Bangladesh to help develop India's remote and alienated northeastern region, Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gujral was speaking in Agartala, capital of the northeast state of Tripura, on the fourth day of a five-day tour to the hilly region, which is largely separated from the rest of India by Bangladesh and connected only by a narrow strip of land.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to open a new chapter for the region with the cooperation of the people of the area and all national and regional parties,&quot; Gujral said.</p>
<p>For decades, northeastern rebels from tribal or vaguely Maoist groups have sought independence, saying New Delhi has failed to address the economic problems of the oil- and mineral-rich region.</p>
<p>Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Tripura and Mizoram -- five of the seven northeastern states called the &quot;seven sisters&quot; -- have each been hit by simmering insurgency movements. Inter-tribal warfare has added to the security problems.</p>
<p>The prime minister was greeted by a general strike in Assam state, where he arrived on Monday, and insurgent tribals killed 11 paramilitary soldiers in an ambush on Wednesday in Manipur, where Gujral was scheduled to arrive on Thursday.</p>
<p>The general strike was first called in Manipur on Thursday by the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), which accused New Delhi of violating human rights in the state.</p>
<p>Gujral said he expected India's proposal for transit through Bangladesh would lead to economic development of the neglected region and help end the insurgencies.</p>
<p>The time and cost of transporting goods to and from the region is expected to be cut if transit rights are granted.</p>
<p>India and Bangladesh earlier this year signed a landmark treaty to share the waters of the Ganges river. The treaty removed a major hurdle in relations between New Delhi and Dhaka, paving the way for other issues to be resolved.</p>
<p>Gujral said the government was ready to hold unconditional talks with insurgents within the framework of the Indian constitution, adding that his centre-left government was committed to solving the region's problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything can be solved through negotiations. The United Front government is approaching the problems of the northeast with a view to achieving a breakthrough,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Gujral promised a separate industrial policy to boost job opportunities in the northeast.</p>
