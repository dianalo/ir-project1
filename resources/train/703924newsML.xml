<p>Luxembourg Treasury Director Yves Mersch said on Wednesday that Luxembourg had no plans during its six-month European Union presidency to fix conversion rates for currencies joining economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have a plan to fix indicative (single currency) rates,&quot; Mersch told a European Parliament monetary subcommittee. &quot;There is a difference between a discussion of how to fix indicative rates and actually fixing them.&quot;</p>
<p>There has been considerable speculation in recent weeks that a method would be found during the Luxembourg presidency for fixing exchange rates to the euro, which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>Many EU policymakers are worried about the potential market turbulence that could result from the prolonged uncertainty over how currency rates would be fixed.</p>
<p>Mersch said it was clear a way had to be found to avoid a situation in which financial markets were unsure how exchange rates would be locked against the new single currency.</p>
<p>But over the next six months, he said, the Luxembourg presidency had no specific mandate to actually devise a plan to fix the rates.</p>
<p>&quot;There will probably be some informal discussions, but no formal procedures,&quot; Mersch said.</p>
<p>One of the more popular methods advanced for locking currency rates has been adoption of the central parity rates within the current European Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p>
<p>Since most currencies in the grid are presently trading close to their central parities, officials say a decision to use the parities as the conversion rates for EMU would alleviate undesired market speculation.</p>
<p>Under the Maastricht Treaty the EU is constrained in deciding in advance what the conversion rates would be against the euro, a decision that will have to wait until December 31, 1998, one day prior to the single currency's launch.</p>
<p>But some pre-announced method for conversion is widely seen as a necessary step and would perhaps be unveiled when the participating countries are chosen in the spring of 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We are conscious of the fact that you cannot have everything building up to a certain date and then have a very long night,&quot; Mersch said.</p>
