<p>Japan's industrial output is expected to have risen in May from the previous month, but economists say that would largely be a reaction to three consecutive months of declines and would not point to a strong upturn in production.</p>
<p>Economists polled this week by Reuters forecast increases ranging from 1.2 percent to 3.0 percent in May output, compared with a revised month-on-month drop of 0.5 percent in April.</p>
<p>The Trade Ministry expects major manufacturers' output to show a 2.7 percent rise in May.</p>
<p>Industrial output data for May and forecasts for June and July will be released on Friday at 1.30 p.m. (0430 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;The figure will show a rise in reaction to the falls of the three previous months, but it won't mean that production is particularly strong,&quot; said Yasuhiko Ushikubo, a senior research economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).</p>
<p>He also said production would be supported by car exports, which continued to reap the benefits of the weak yen during the early part of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong exports are behind the (rise in production),&quot; added an economist with Nomura Research Institute.</p>
<p>But economists said production was unlikely to jump soon, pointing out the fall in private demand following the rise in the national consumption tax to five percent from three percent on April 1.</p>
<p>Despite the flow of exports, domestic sales of vehicles fell 9.4 percent in May from a year earlier, dropping for the second consecutive month.</p>
<p>Sales at department stores in May also declined 5.1 percent from a year earlier along with those at chain stores, which fell 4.6 percent from a year earlier in May.</p>
<p>&quot;There seems to be a gap between firms' plans for production and actual demand. If we see a build-up of inventories in the April-June period, there will be a possibility of cuts in future production,&quot; said an economist at Sanwa Research Institute.</p>
<p>Economists also said the real focus was on production beyond July, to see whether the effects of the April tax rise on the economy had tapered off.</p>
<p>&quot;We knew production was going to take a breather in the April-June quarter following the tax hike. Everyone wants to know whether it'll be able to pick up again in the July-September period. In that sense, the July forecast is the focus,&quot; said IBJ's Ushikubo.</p>
<p>The following is a breakdown of economists' forecasts for May:</p>
<p>				     mth/mth	     yr/yr</p>
<p> Daiwa Bank Research	   +1.2 pct	    +4.0 pct</p>
<p> Kankaku Research Institute  +1.6 PCT	    +4.5 pct</p>
<p> IndustriaL Bank of Japan    +2.3 pct	    +5.3 pct</p>
<p> Nikko Research Center	 +2.3 pct	    N.A.</p>
<p> Sanwa Research Institute    +2.3 pct	    +5.2 pct</p>
<p> BZW Securities Japan	  +2.5 PCT	    +5.5 pct</p>
<p> Nomura Research Institute   +3.0 pct	    +5.9 pct</p>
