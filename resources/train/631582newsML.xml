<p>Syrian Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam said on Monday that Israel's stance on Middle East peace makes regional economic summits useless and that it would be better for Arabs to hold their own economic meeting.</p>
<p>But Khaddam told reporters in Cairo that barring Israel from a Middle East North Africa (MENA) economic summit in Qatar in November would be against the point of the gathering.</p>
<p>Khaddam was speaking after he and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for talks on the Middle East peace process and regional affairs.</p>
<p>Qatar is hosting the 1997 economic conference, the fourth since the landmark 1991 Madrid Middle East peace conference which launched peace negotiations. Israel attended all three previous conferences.</p>
<p>Syria and some Gulf Arab states favour postponing this year's MENA summit until Middle East peace talks resume.</p>
<p>Qatar's foreign minister has said Israel could be invited to the MENA summit if it changed its position in peace talks.</p>
<p>Asked if Israel should be barred from the MENA gathering in Doha later this year, Khaddam said:</p>
<p>&quot;The economic summit was set up for the sake of Israel and to establish Israel as a member and partner in the region. Therefore, holding the summit without Israel will stand in the way of achieving the ends of those who worked for such summits.</p>
<p>&quot;If we want to hold such summits, why not hold an Arab economic summit?... Why do we concentrate on such summits in light of current Israeli policy, which obstructs the peace process and cancels the points of reference of peace in the region. It is not useful,&quot; Khaddam said.</p>
<p>Talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been stalled since March when the Jewish state began building a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem and a bomber killed himself and three Israeli women in a Tel Aviv cafe.</p>
<p>Syria has strongly condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for refusing to swap occupied Arab lands for peace and for expanding Jewish settlement in occupied areas.</p>
<p>Syrian-Israeli peace talks are stalled over the fate of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967. Syria wants a full Israeli pullback from the strategic plateau.</p>
<p>Israel broke off peace negotiations with Syria over a year ago, before Netanyahu took office.</p>
