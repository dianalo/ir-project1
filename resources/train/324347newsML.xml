<p>Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, reportedly ill with inoperable cancer, said on Wednesday presidential elections would be held this year as scheduled.</p>
<p>Although the authoritarian nationalist leader did not say he would seek a third term in office, his announcement put an apparent end to speculation that his party would manoeuvre to avoid a presidential vote should Tudjman feel too ill.</p>
<p>In his annual &quot;State of the Nation&quot; address to parliament, Tudjman, 74, described &quot;tasks in the current, 1997 year&quot; and made clear presidential elections due in the second half of 1997 would be held on schedule.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, the presidential election is of no less importance. It is the state administration's duty to create conditions so it can be carried out normally,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Western diplomats have said Tudjman's illness was so serious he might have to step down in a matter of months.</p>
<p>Analysts believe the HDZ, its popularity in rapid decline over corruption and mismanagement of the economy, has no popular candidate to replace Tudjman, who has steered the country since its independence from federal Yugoslavia in 1991.</p>
<p>Independent weeklies had said the HDZ might instead change the constitution so the parliament, in which it holds the majority, could directly elect the head of state.</p>
