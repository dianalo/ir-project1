<p>Colombian stocks ended higher for the fifth consecutive session in active trading that saw gains led by brewer Bavaria, Banco Ganadero and Cementos del Caribe.</p>
<p>Medellin's IBOMED general price index closed up 1.04 percent at 16,971.31 on trading volume of about 1.4 billion pesos. Bogota's IBB ended up 1.23 percent, meanwhile, closing at 1,105.21 on a volume of 1.7 billion pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;The most liquid shares continue rising on demand from foreign funds,&quot; said one Medellin-based broker.  </p>
<p>He said expectations of a drop in domestic interest rates were also positive for equities since they took some of the premium off investment by locals in the fixed income market.</p>
<p>Bavaria, flagship of the Julio Mario Santo Domingo industrial group, rose 2.84 percent to an all-time high of 7,898 pesos per share in Medellin as investors continued pouring money into the stock on news of the company's recent announcement of a planned share split.</p>
<p>Ganadero, the country's largest bank in terms of assets, saw its preferred stock rise 2.26 percent in Bogota to end at 271 pesos per share, meanwhile.  </p>
<p>Traders said the bank was one of several companies whose heavily traded blue-chip shares had benefitted from an ongoing trend by some investors out of securities and into stocks.</p>
<p>Cementos del Caribe was the day's biggest winner by far, closing up 3.72 percent in Bogota at 5,601 per share as investors continued to favor it and other companies belonging to the highly diversified Sindicato Antioqueno conglomerate.</p>
<p>The conglomerate's Compania Suramericana de Seguros, also closed higher, ending up 0.87 percent in Medellin at 23,411 pesos per share.</p>
