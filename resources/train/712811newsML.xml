<headline>Hungary BUX ends at fifth closing high in row.</headline>

<p>Hungarian share prices finished at a fifth successive closing high on Tuesday, driven by the absence of any bad news rather than on the back of any fresh development, market participants said.</p>
<p>The BUX index finished at a preliminary 7,241.09 points, up 43.27.</p>
<p>Market participants said it would be time for some downward corrections but they added the market might survive the summer with a slightly positive tone on the back of the country's positive assessment.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of positive corporate earnings and improving macrgeconomic figures the market may maintain its levels and would not fall,&quot; said Robert Cselovszki of WestLB Investment. &quot;At least the market points to this direction.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, however, that he maintained his opinion that a minor correction will come due to summer holidays.</p>
<p>An analyst expected the market's slightly positive trend to remain, as the cash inflow into the Hungarian market would continue, albeit at a slower pace.</p>
<p>&quot;A mildly positive trend will prevail for some more weeks, simply because there isn't any bad news,&quot;0said Andrea Dicso, analyst at Bank Austria-Investment Rt.</p>
<p>BUX futures also continued their upward moves, boosting yield content. September BUX finished at 7,439 points, compared to Monday's settlement price of 7,400 points.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, pharmaceuticals Egis Rt EGIS.BU remained among top gainers, adding almost five percent or 650 forints, to finish at a new closing high of 14,300 forints.</p>
<p>Chemicals TVK maintained its rally and finished at a new high of 3,720 forints, up 90.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, tinned food manufacturer Globus firmed to a new high of 2,750 forints, before retreating to finish at 2,500 forints, up 100.</p>
