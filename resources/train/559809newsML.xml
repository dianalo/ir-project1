<headline>Texas separatist killed in shoot-out with police.</headline>
<dateline>FORT DAVIS, Texas 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Police Monday shot and killed one of two Republic of Texas separatists who escaped from the group's compound in the west Texas mountains over the weekend, a police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;A Justice of the Peace was called to pronounce him dead,&quot; police spokeswoman Sherri Deatherage Green said. &quot;The other suspect is still at large.&quot;  </p>
<p>The man -- whom police did not name -- was shot and killed after he fired on a pack of bloodhounds and at a police helicopter, Green said.</p>
<p>Police dogs on Monday tracked the two men, identified as Mike Matson, 48, and Richard Keyes, 21, through rugged terrain in the Davis Mountains where they have been hiding since Saturday, she said.</p>
<p>Keyes is wanted on state kidnapping charges and Matson is wanted for questioning, police said.</p>
<p>The two men, dressed in camouflage and armed with an assault rifle, a deer-hunting rifle and a .9mm pistol, left the compound hours before Republic of Texas leader Richard McLaren signed a cease-fire and surrendered.</p>
