<p>British scientists said on Monday they thought they have isolated a gene which is an important precursor of the deadly Alzheimer's disease that causes progressive dementia.</p>
<p>Researchers at Applied Biogenes Ltd told Reuters they have applied for a patent for their work, which could allow doctors to identify people most at risk from the disease and prevent it from taking hold.</p>
<p>The discovery also offers the hope of discovering drugs to combat Alzheimer's, which affects around 800,000 people in Britain alone and is almost impossible to diagnose and treat. A high-profile sufferer is former U.S. President Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Applied Biogenes said its researchers have found a gene which deposits a key protein associated with Alzheimer's in the brain.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have this gene it doesn't necessarily mean you will get Alzheimer's,&quot; he said. Other factors also contribute to the onset of the condition.</p>
<p>But he added that as a result of the work, &quot;development of a simple method for either diagnosis of the predisposition to this disease or prognosis can be achieved.&quot;  </p>
<p>The next step for Applied Biogenes' molecular biologists will be to look at ways of blocking or modifying the action of the gene to stop Alzheimer's from developing, and working on drugs for its prevention.</p>
<p>The spokesman said it may be several years before patients can benefit from the discovery of the gene.</p>
<p>The company, which employs just five people, eventually intends to license its technology to pharmaceutical companies, although no talks have been held with potential partners.</p>
<p>Applied Biogenes said it may also have isolated a gene which predisposes people to multiple sclerosis, although work on this project was not as far advanced as on Alzheimer's.</p>
