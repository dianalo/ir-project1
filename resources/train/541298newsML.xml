<p>A majority of French voters say that Gaullist President Jacques Chirac failed to keep most of his key 1995 campaign promises, according to a poll published on Friday in the weekly Le Nouvel Economiste.</p>
<p>The CSA survey found that most voters felt he had kept just one promise made during his campaign -- to take France down the path toward European monetary union and a single currency.</p>
<p>On most of his other key pledges -- including lowering taxes, creating jobs, boosting state salaries and an assurance that health care reimbursements would remain uncapped -- most voters judged that he had failed to keep his promises, the poll found.</p>
<p>&quot;Two years after his arrival at the Elysee (presidential palace), Jacques Chirac's performance has little to do with his campaign promises, a gap so flagrant that the president is today obliged -- by the coming legislative election -- to once again establish his legitimacy,&quot; the weekly said.</p>
<p>On the question of preparing France for a single European currency, two-thirds of voters felt Chirac had kept his campaign pledge while 16 percent said he had failed and 18 percent had no opinion.</p>
<p>Concerning his pledge to lower taxes, 35 percent said he had kept his promise while 55 percent said he had failed.</p>
<p>And on unemployment, nearly two-thirds said he had failed to honour his promise to reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>Roughly seven in 10 of those polled said they believed that a president must always keep his campaign promises while the remainder felt it was permissible for a president to fall short on his pledges if he felt it was necessary, according to the survey of 1,005 individuals aged 18 and over.</p>
<p>The poll was conducted on April 7-8, well before Chirac announced he was dissolving parliament and calling a snap election for May 25-June 1.</p>
