<p>Canada confirmed on Tuesday it has offered to lead a multinational military force to provide humanitarian aid to Hutu refugees in Zaire but said details of the operation were still being worked out.</p>
<p>&quot;What we can tell you at this point is that Canada has offered to take the lead in a humanitarian relief mission that would be a multinational force,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catherine Lappe told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Beyond that, we are in a process where both the prime minister and the foreign minister are calling a number of their counterparts to get a better sense of where different countries are at in terms of the mandate, the funding issues and the troop contribution commitment,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy may be in a position later on Tuesday to give more details of the operation, Lappe added.</p>
<p>More than a million Hutu refugees in central Africa face starvation and disease after being displaced by four weeks of savage fighting between the Zairian army and Tutsi-led rebels.</p>
<p>Asked about the mandate of the multinational force, Lappe said it would help maintain safe operation of local airports, shipments of relief supplies and relocation of refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;There would have to be airlift capacity and freeing the airports. There would have to be help with the distribution networks. There would have to be assistance in getting aid to the (refugee) camps. And there would have to be allowing for the voluntary repatriation of refugees,&quot; Lappe said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very fluid situation right now; we are trying to work out the details.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada has at its disposal a special Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) formed by the military to provide disaster relief at home and abroad. The rapid response team, comprised of about 180 people drawn mainly from the military on a rotating basis, can be deployed to provide relief for up to 40 days until long-term international relief is provided.</p>
<p>But a Defence Department spokesman said no decision had been made yet as to whether the team would be part of the Zaire operation.</p>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali said earlier on Tuesday in Rome that he expected more than 12 countries to participate in the Canadian-led relief force.</p>
<p>South Africa and some European nations including Italy have agreed in principle to send troops. Boutros-Ghali said he was also in contact with France and Spain and hoped to get logistical support from the United States.</p>
