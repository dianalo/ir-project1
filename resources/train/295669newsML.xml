<p>President Boris Yeltsin, forced back to hospital by pneumonia, was fighting a new battle on Thursday to prove he can rule Russia only two months after major heart surgery.</p>
<p>The Kremlin, keen to quash alarm over this latest setback, said the 65-year-old president, who was admitted to hospital on Wednesday, had a normal temperature and was being treated with antibiotics.</p>
<p>It said he had discussed affairs of state by telephone with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who left on Thursday for a scheduled break but was keeping a close eye on developments.</p>
<p>NTV television said arrangements had been made for Yeltsin to retain control over Russia's nuclear arsenal from hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;Treatment of the pneumonia is being carried out with modern antibiotics and with general therapy,&quot; a Kremlin statement said.</p>
<p>Heart surgeon Renat Akchurin, who led the quintuple bypass operation on Yeltsin on November 5, said the president's doctors had told him he was in &quot;a quite satisfactory&quot; condition.</p>
<p>Akchurin told reporters the pneumonia was not related to the operation and that the president's overall health allowed him to perform his duties.</p>
<p>&quot;The post-operative period finished a month ago, so it seems to me that it makes no sense to now connect something with the operation,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Russia's fledgling financial markets reacted cautiously to the news of the pneumonia. Share prices slid but then recovered, and other markets firmed as dealers awaited developments.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who has vast powers under Russia's post-communist constitution, only returned to work on December 23 after almost six months out of the Kremlin with heart problems.</p>
<p>The Kremlin announced the new illness quickly after doctors ordered Yeltsin to hospital, but it has not always revealed the full truth about the president's condition in the past.</p>
<p>On Monday it said Yeltsin had a heavy cold after the president, looking pale and tired, cancelled all appointments from Monday and moved to a residence outside Moscow to rest.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, it said doctors had detected early signs of pneumonia when they examined the Kremlin leader.</p>
<p>&quot;In connection with this, in order to make a better diagnosis and to conduct appropriate treatment, a decision has been taken to take him to the Central Clinical Hospital (in Moscow) for several days,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>A presidential spokesman said Yeltsin entered the hospital at about nine p.m. (1800 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pioneering U.S. heart surgeon Michael DeBakey who advised Akchurin over Yeltsin's heart surgery, joined his Russian colleagues in ruling out a link with the operation.</p>
<p>Asked if Yeltsin had recovered from the trauma of the heart surgery, DeBakey said: &quot;I would say pretty much yes and his heart is functioning now virtually normally.&quot;</p>
<p>But some of Yeltsin's political opponents seized on his new health problem to attack him.</p>
<p>General Alexander Lebed, sacked by Yeltsin as national security adviser last October for manifesting open presidential ambitions, said on Thursday the president's illness had left Russia rudderless and that he should step down.</p>
<p>&quot;The president is badly ill. It's a difficult age, he's had a difficult operation, a not entirely healthy way of life for the past 40 years. It doesn't leave much hope,&quot; said the general, who would be a strong candidate to succeed Yeltsin.</p>
<p>&quot;(Yeltsin) should offer his resignation. The president is in hospital, the prime minister is on holiday and people have not been paid and are not paid. No one has dealt with the economy ...Someone has to answer for that, someone has to rule.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin suffered two heart attacks in 1995 and his long absences from the Kremlin fuelled a struggle for position among Kremlin officials that culminated in Lebed's sacking.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin took on extra powers but only assumed formal control for a day during the operation itself.</p>
<p>If Yeltsin, who has played a major role in Russia's transition from communist rule and has been president since 1991, was unable to govern, Chernomyrdin would stand in for up to three months before an election.</p>
<p>On his return to the Kremlin, Yeltsin vowed to deal with problems which had built up in his absence, including tax evasion which drained state coffers and led to long delays in wage and pension payments. But he did not have time to do so.</p>
