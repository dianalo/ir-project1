<p>Taiwan's industrial conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group has &quot;turned sand into gold&quot; in a poor local county by building a multibillion-dollar petrochemical complex, President Lee Teng-hui was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Lee said during a visit to the US$9 billion complex on Saturday that Formosa's effort had created prosperity and &quot;turned sand into gold&quot; in the poor Yunlin county in southern Taiwan, the United Daily News newspaper reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Construction of the complex, including Taiwan's sixth, and the first private, naphtha cracker and an oil refinery, started in 1993 and is expected to finish in six years.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been encouraging its businessmen to increase investments at home over fears that its economy might become too dependent on China, the island's political rival since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Under government pressure, Formosa in August withdrew its application to build a US$3 billion power plant in China, after it withdrew a US$6 billion petrochemical project in China in 1992.</p>
