<p>French paramilitary gendarmes probing the rape and murder of a British teenager last year aim to seek a genetic test of a suspected child abductor detained in southern France, judicial sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>They said the investigators planned to request tests on the DNA genetic material of 35-year-old Jean-Paul Barbault, detained in southwest France on Friday and placed under investigation on suspicion of trying to kidnap a 10-year-old child.</p>
<p>Investigators who have questioned Barbault say he has admitted about 10 sexual attacks on minors in southwestern France and in Brittany in the northwest, the sources said.</p>
<p>Gendarmes have no direct evidence to suspect him of involvement in the murder of 13-year-old British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson, who was raped and smothered in a youth hostel in Brittany in July 1996 while on a school trip.</p>
<p>Dickinson was found dead by other classmates sleeping in the same room. Police have so far turned up few clues in their hunt for the killer. One suspect who allegedly confessed to the crime later retracted and DNA tests showed he was not responsible.</p>
