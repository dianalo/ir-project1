<p>China's stock markets on Wednesday ignored the widespread national euphoria over the return of Hong Kong to Chinese control and fell sharply, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said stock prices in Shanghai and Shenzhen are expected to consolidate ahead of the reporting of interim results later this month as investors try to shake off the hangover from the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule at midnight last Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets will consolidate in the short term,&quot; said a broker in Shenzhen. &quot;There are no new incentives to buy after the handover.&quot;</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign currency B share index ended Wednesday down 2.788 points or 3.42 percent at 78.690 points, while the domestic currency A index fell 53.764 points or 4.11 percent to 1,253.014 points.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's A shares slid 18.30 points or 4.07 percent to 431.12 driven down in part by heavy losses in market giant Shenzhen Development Bank, on news it might be given a lighter weighting in the market's main sub-index.</p>
<p>Trading in Shenzhen B shares will resume on Thursday after a longer holiday for the Hong Kong handover.</p>
<p>Investors made decisions months ago on how to play the Hong Kong handover, which sparked a rally early in 1997 until May when the government cracked down on the market to stop excessive speculation, brokers said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is no longer a factor and China's short-term minded local investors are waiting for fresh clues on which to base their next move, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hong Kong handover was good for popular feeling, but it doesn't have much meaning for the market now,&quot; said an analyst at China Southern Securities in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The quality of 1997 interim results -- scheduled for July and August -- could provide new direction, but most brokers predict only selective buying, which would not boost the market decisively.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very difficult to say what interim results will look like overall,&quot; said an analyst at an Asian securities firm in Shanghai. &quot;Interims won't be as bad as last year but they won't be great.&quot;</p>
<p>Credit loosening -- in the form of an interest rate cut or reduction in the bank reserve ratio -- would provide stronger motivation to buy shares, but the timing of such a move is still uncertain, analysts said.</p>
<p>Some brokers speculate an interest rate cut is imminent, while others said it is unlikely before the end of 1997.</p>
<p>In the meantime, China's stock markets are likely to move lower, but falls will be limited by buying at lower levels, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't expect the markets to go much lower,&quot; said an an analyst at a foreign securities firm in Shanghai. &quot;If Hong Kong (stocks) looks good it might give a bit of a boost to the China markets.&quot;</p>
