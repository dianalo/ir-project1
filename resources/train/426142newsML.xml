<p>A leading warlord and presidential candidate in Liberia, Alhaji Kromah, was arrested on Friday after peacekeepers found a large cache of arms at his home, the African peacekeeping force said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have placed him under arrest,&quot; the commander of the ECOMOG peacekeeping force, Major Victor Malu, told reporters.</p>
<p>A senior ECOMOG official said Kromah had been moved from his house in the Congo district of the capital Monrovia to the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force's barracks.</p>
<p>&quot;After our investigation we will turn him over to the interim government police and we hope he will be prosecuted,&quot; Malu said. &quot;He will be treated like the other criminals found with illegal weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>Malu, a tough-talking Nigerian general, said Kromah's arrest showed his force was prepared to stand up to any of Liberia's warlords who frustrated more a dozen previous peace plans meant to end seven years of civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;I am prepared to deal with any resistance from anywhere and I don't think anybody can dare me,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said 40 of Kromah's men were also arrested. An ECOMOG officer who led the search said the men were receiving military training in Kromah's compound when the troops raided.</p>
<p>Liberia's warring factions have officially been disbanded and all weapons were supposed to have been surrendered by a January 31 deadline under the latest peace accord signed last August. Elections are set for May 30.</p>
<p>&quot;The arms were right in his house and include anti-aircraft guns and brand new rifles still in their packaging,&quot; Malu said, adding that it took three large trucks to move the weapons to ECOMOG's headquarters.</p>
<p>Reporters saw the haul, which included hundreds of cases of explosives sporting fake labels as consignments for the International Committee of the Red Cross, European Union aid programmes or international aid agencies.</p>
<p>All the arms carried made-in-China labels. Kromah visited China in January. His main rival for president, Charles Taylor, was in Taiwan last month. Liberia is one of many African states where the two China's are playing out their rivalry.</p>
<p>Malu said an ECOMOG task force staged a surprise search of the homes of all four principal warlords, including Taylor who started civil war in 1989.</p>
<p>The other two are Krahn tribal militia warlords George Boley and General Roosevelt Johnson, who was at the centre of warfare in the Liberian capital in April and May last year.</p>
<p>Johnson, now a cabinet minister in the transitional government, was not at home when heavily armed peacekeepers arrived for the search. Troops kicked in the doors and went in.</p>
<p>Boley and Taylor were both at home and cooperated with the troops, Malu said.</p>
<p>Malu said ECOMOG troops also seized a large consignment of weapons on Thursday after a search of the Executive Mansion, the seat Liberia's temporarily ruling council.</p>
<p>Taylor, Kromah and Boley were all on the council until they quit a week ago to contest elections wrapping up the peace plan.</p>
<p>Taylor stopped using his office at the Mansion since he survived an assassination attempt there on October 31.</p>
