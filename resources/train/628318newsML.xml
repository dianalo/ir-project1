<title>JAPAN: Ex-Nomura chief arrested in racketeer case.</title>
<headline>Ex-Nomura chief arrested in racketeer case.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tokyo prosecutors said on Friday they had arrested former Nomura Securities Co Ltd president Hideo Sakamaki on suspicion of conspiring with three Nomura executives to give 38.5 million yen ($331,000) to racketeer Ryuichi Koike in March 1995.  </p>
<p>The prosecutors said in a statement that they had arrested Sakamaki on suspicion of violating Japan's securities exchange law and the commercial code.</p>
<p>They said they believed the cash was given to the racketeer on March 15, 1995, as a token of appreciation for his future cooperation in making the company's shareholders' meeting, which was held in June, go smoothly.</p>
<p>Sakamaki, who stepped down as president in March and is now an adviser to the giant brokerage, told a parliamentary panel this week that he had briefly met Koike in 1992, but denied knowledge of any stock deals by the racketeer through Nomura.</p>
<p>The scandal -- the second involving Nomura in six years -- has not only hurt the brokerage's business but has also further tarnished the image of Japan's financial institutions at a critical time as they prepare to compete in Tokyo's increasingly deregulated markets. ($1=116 yen)</p>
