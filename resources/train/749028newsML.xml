<p>A former Haitian police chief said on Wednesday he believed the United States would try to kill him now that Honduras has refused to deliver him to the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Washington had been trying to extradite Col.Joseph Michel Francois on charges of drug trafficking.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday Honduras' Supreme Court of Justice rejected the U.S.'s request to extradite Francois, who was chief of police in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince during its 1991-94 military regime.</p>
<p>The court said Washington had failed to provide enough evidence to allow them to comply with the request.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective for them now is to kill Michel Francois,&quot; Francois told reporters.</p>
<p>A spokeman for the U.S. Embassy in Honduras said Francois' remarks were groundless.</p>
<p>Francois, 39, arrived in Honduras from the Dominican Republic in April 1996 and was arrested by Honduran police backed by U.S. agents.</p>
<p>He told reporters he will remain in Honduras, in the northern city of San Pedro Sula, where he has a furniture store.</p>
<p>The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in the Honduran capital, Marti Estell, declined to comment on the court's decision to reject the extradition of Francois.</p>
<p>&quot;The embassy had not received any official certification from the court and so we have nothing to say,&quot; he said, adding the comments by Francois were &quot;without foundation.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. drug enforcement officials had originally hoped to whisk Francois straight to Miami after he first landed in Honduras, and were dismayed when Honduran authorities held up the operation as he was being escorted to the airport.</p>
<p>The United States has tried several times to have the Haitian, who is accused of human rights abuses in his home country, brought to trial in the United States.</p>
<p>Washington says he used his position to turn the Caribbean island country into a vast staging post to ship thousands of pounds of cocaine and heroin into the United States.</p>
<p>He is also believed to have masterminded the coup that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1990.</p>
