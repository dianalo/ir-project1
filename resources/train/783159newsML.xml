<headline>Dull German shares lose ground in late trade.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-08-06</dateline>

<p>German shares eased on Wednesday afternoon as the dollar dropped off the day's highs, taking stocks down in its wake.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index was down 4.88 points at 4,320.98 points at 1345 GMT, having closed the bourse session at mid-afternoon at 4,335.39 points.</p>
<p>September DTB DAX futures were down 10 points at 4,343 points.</p>
<p>The dollar, which had boosted share prices earlier as it briefly breached an eight-year high of 1.89 marks, was trading around 1.88 marks in the late afternoon.  </p>
<p>Dealers said there was still no clear trend on the market. Uncertainties about the Bundesbank's interest rate strategy were still undermining market activity.</p>
<p>Moreover, Wall Street shares eased at their opening, further unsettling German traders.</p>
<p>Activity was focused on individual shares, such as utility Veba AG, up 2.30 marks at 110.40 marks ahead of its interim report which is due on Thursday.</p>
