<p>Nearly 750 fishermen were missing in the Bay of Bengal three days after a cyclone battered the Bangladesh coast killing around 100 people, fishing sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;About 750 of our men are still missing. They went to sea before the cyclone struck on Monday but did not return,&quot; said Kabir Ahmed, leader of the Mechanised Fishing Boats Association in Cox's Bazar.</p>
<p>&quot;We only hope they would come back alive,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;But no official search has been launched to find the missing fishermen.&quot;</p>
<p>Some 1,500 fishermen were reported missing on Tuesday, but Ahmed and other association leaders said half of them had returned by Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;In the event of every storm, scores of fishing crew drown in the Bay of Bengal because they cannot get to shore in time despite hearing storm warnings over the radio,&quot; Ahmed said.</p>
<p>Officials in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh's premier tourist resort, said the fishermen often ignore warnings for the lure of a big catch.</p>
<p>&quot;Some boats don't have radio or their engines are not strong enough to combat high waves,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Officials on Thursday said all measures had been taken to prevent an outbreak of disease or hunger as people returned home from cyclone shelters.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no information yet of an outbreak of disease or people facing starvation from anywhere in the affected areas,&quot; one Chittagong official said. &quot;We are keeping a constant vigil and speeding up relief supplies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As of now, there is no shortage of drinking water or medical assistance for the cyclone survivors,&quot; he added. &quot;Hundreds of medical teams are working.&quot;</p>
<p>Jawadul Karim, press secretary to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, told reporters on Wednesday that nearly 2.5 million people were affected by the cyclone that roared in from the Bay of Bengal, packing winds up to 200 kph (125 mph).</p>
<p>He put the confirmed death toll so far at 95 -- down from the 121 earlier reported by police and officials. More than 7,000 people had been injured in the cyclone, which Hasina said had caused fewer deaths than was feared.</p>
<p>The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva said on Wednesday that the cyclone had killed at least 200 people.</p>
<p>Low-lying Bangladesh is prone to devastation from cyclones. The country's worst storm in 1991 killed at least 138,000 people and left millions homeless.</p>
<p>Officials in the port city of Chittagong said on Tuesday nearly 400,000 houses had been damaged in the cyclone, leaving 1.5 million people homeless. Thousands of cattle were killed.</p>
<p>&quot;We are making a full assessment of the losses, which may take a week or more. But so far it looks like that the extent (of damage) is within a manageable limit,&quot; an official said.</p>
<p>Cox's Bazar officials said some fishermen had started going back to sea from storm-battered islands on Thursday, while the fate of others remained unknown.</p>
<p>&quot;Fishing is their only living, they just can't sit idle,&quot; one official said. &quot;Besides, they are used to the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Navy vessels helping in relief operation in the islands had received no orders to search for the missing fishermen, navy sources in Chittagong said on Thursday.</p>
