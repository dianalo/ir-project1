<p>Hungary's state-owned development bank Magyar Fejlesztesi Bank Rt (MFB) said on Thursday it planned further expansion in 1997 by boosting its lendings in its core business of economic development.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish to concentrate on projects which aim to stimulate the economy,&quot; Andras Huszty, MFB's CEO told a news conference following MFB's annual general meeting.</p>
<p>The bank plans to increase its pre-tax profit to between 3.1 billion to 3.2 billion forints from 2.76 billion in 1996, and sees its lendings rising to above 50 billion forints from 21 billion, Huszty said.</p>
<p>MFB aims at increasing its balance sheet total to 160 billion forints from 91.9 billion.</p>
<p>Huszty said the bank began on Thursday the process of merging one of its subsidiary banks Corvinbank Rt into another, Konzumbank Rt, to raise its competitiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this restructuring makes it possible to create a bank which has a good position on the money markets in terms of clients, capital and services,&quot; Huszty said.</p>
<p>Corvinbank is specialised in financing developing competitive entrepreneurs and in factoring, while Konzumbank is a commercial bank, also serving retail clients.</p>
<p>MFB, which until the end of 1996 was called Hungarian Investment and Development Bank (MBFB), is Hungary's only development bank, ranking ninth in 1996 in terms of pre-tax and after-tax profits, and 12th in terms of balance sheet total, among banks, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The MFB group, which also includes a securities house and regional development companies, offers businesses medium- and long-term loans, collects claims, and turns around companies for resale.</p>
