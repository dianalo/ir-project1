<headline>Amman stocks drop as foreign buying lessens.</headline>
<dateline>AMMAN 1997-05-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Jordanian bourse fell slightly on Saturday after a buying spree by foreign emerging funds which lifted blue-chips higher this week appeared to lose steam, dealers said.</p>
<p>But foreign fund buying on a more limited scale on market favourites Jordan Cement, Jordan Phospate Mines, and Arab Potash Co continues to underpin the bourse.</p>
<p>The official 60-share Amman Financial Market (AFM) index shed 0.01 percent to 155.85 points in lower trade worth 570,782 dinars. ($806,189).</p>
<p>The market will close on Sunday May 25, a public holiday to celebrate independence day. Trading resumes on Monday.</p>
<p>Jordan's bourse saw active buying by foreign funds on select mining and industrial stock in heightened interest by emerging funds in its shares, seen as undervalued compared with other regional markets such as Egypt, which have seen record inflows.</p>
<p>But lack of liquidity continues to hamper small investor trading with most of the activity now restricted to foreigners and some of the larger local funds.</p>
<p>Jordan Cement dominated volume for the third consecutive day as strong foreign interest in the blue-chip was maintained, brokers said.</p>
<p>It was unchanged at 3.92 dinars in high turnover worth 316,031 dinars.</p>
<p>The second heavily traded stock, Jordan Phosphates, was also unchanged at 3.50 dinars in trade worth 46,025 dinars.</p>
<p>Arab Potash rose 0.02 dinars in trade worth 34,321 dinars.</p>
<p>Overall falling shares outnumbered gainers by 24 to 8 while 12 were unchanged.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 best-performing shares in terms of turnover and financial performance shed 0.09 percent to 79.70 points, 4.43 percent down from the start of the year.</p>
