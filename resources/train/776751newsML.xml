<title>UK: Dated Brent talked softer, other North Sea steady.</title>
<headline>Dated Brent talked softer, other North Sea steady.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>North Sea crudes were mixed in early talk on Monday as Dated Brent eased and other grades held onto last week's differentials, traders said.</p>
<p>Two Brent cargoes, loading Aug 14-16 and Aug 16-18, were offered at Aug Brent evens after Friday trade at +3 cents as muted US interest left sellers looking for alternative outlets.</p>
<p>&quot;Bids are pretty scarce in the U.S. Gulf at the moment,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>One Brent cargo was nominated loading dates of Aug 19-21 on Monday and had passed from the equity holder to a Wall Street trader by midday.  </p>
<p>Cash Brent intermonth spreads were steady to a shade firmer, Aug/Sep offered at +50 cents after a deal late on Friday at +43 cents and Sep/Oct offered at an unchanged +2 cents.</p>
<p>But traders said there were few bids against those offers.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got Aug/Sep at +35/+50 (cents) and no bids on the Sep/Oct,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>CFDs were also steady, Aug 11-15 trading at Sept Brent +1 cent. There was unconfirmed talk of a deal for the same period at Sept Brent +2 cents.</p>
<p>IPE Sept Brent shed four cents to $18.91 a barrel by 1158 GMT.  </p>
<p>Dealers said they were waiting for U.S. markets to open and for any signs of progress towards the resumption of Iraqi exports. The U.N. is expected to approve Baghdad's aid distribution plan early this week.</p>
<p>Apart from Brent, other North Sea crudes were broadly unchanged after several cargoes due to load in the second half of August found homes with refiners on Friday.</p>
<p>A French refiner was particularly active, picking up a couple of Statfjords and an Oseberg. Another Oseberg also changed hands as did a Forties cargo, a Beryl and a Gullfaks C, traders said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7930</p>
