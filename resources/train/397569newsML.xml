<p>Polish debt-ridden furniture maker Swarzedz SA is likely to finalise a debt restructuring deal with banking creditors in the next few days, the company's spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Sebastian Szczesny said the firm, which owes banks 60.5 million zlotys, had reached an initial agreement with its largest banking creditors.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage the restructuring agreement is being finalised and in the next few days the agreement is likely to be signed,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>According to preliminary figures Swarzedz had a net loss of 38.6 million zlotys in 1996.</p>
<p>Szczesny said that according to the agreement the creditors would buy about 3.1 million shares of Swarzedz's new issue and the funds from the issue would be used to pay off a part of the overdue loans.</p>
<p>Earlier the company has said the issue to creditors would settle a major part of its debts, while the rest would be paid in the future out of increased sales which would result from investing proceeds from the rights issue.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Swarzedz SA shareholders approved an issue of up to 6.625 million shares, with 3.125 million in a debt-for-equity scheme and 3.5 million in a one-for-one rights issue to current shareholders.</p>
