<p>Colombia's peso ended 5.1 pesos higher versus the dollar at 1,059.45 in speculative trading that followed a high court's decision to overturn the government's three-month-old economic emergency plan.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was full of speculation, especially coming from people hoping to take advantage of uncertainty caused by news about the end of the economic emergency,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>He and others noted that the peso had closed well off its intraday high of 1,056.90, however, and said they do not expect it to extend its gains on fallout from the Constitutional Court's ruling that the government had no business dictating economic policy by decree.</p>
<p>Measures introduced as part of the emergency, which were stricken down by the court, included a six percent tax on all new foreign loans.  The tax was aimed at preventing a new surge in the peso, which strenghtened considerably to the detriment of exporters late last year on huge inflows of oil money and foreign capital.</p>
<p>To avoid another runup, the central bank hastily changed its reserve requirements Wednesday night to require that 50 percent of any new foreign loans be left on deposit with the Banco de la Republica for 18 months.</p>
<p>Dealers reported 314 trades in Thursday's session, which got off to a late start because of problems with an electronic trading system, and said the peso's low for the day was 1,066.</p>
