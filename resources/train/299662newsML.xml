<headline>Toronto stocks end higher, but behind Dow rally.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toronto stocks ended higher on Friday, but Canada's biggest stock market lagged behind Wall Street for a second straight day.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index climbed 25.57 points to close at 5984.93 in heavy turnover of 105.5 million shares worth C$1.69 billion ($1.25 billion).</p>
<p>In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied over 78 points to a record close of 6703.79.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 shrugged off early session losses due to weak bonds which tumbled on a buoyant U.S. employment report. The rebound was led by strong gains in gold and base metal stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Commodity prices in the last few weeks have been upticking and that has helped the Incos and Alcans,&quot; said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada.</p>
<p>Among the TSE's eight strong sectors, golds added 133 points and base metals improved 111 points.</p>
<p>Oil and gas, which climbed 88 points, received a boost from higher energy prices due to recent cold weather.</p>
<p>Toronto's six weak groups were led by financial services, communications and media, and consumer products.</p>
<p>In other news, Statistics Canada reported the Canadian economy created 34,000 jobs in December. Economists said the stronger employment growth confirmed that the economy was shifting into higher gear for 1997.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Westar Group Ltd. led gainers, jumping 6 to close at a new high of 61. Analysts said the sale of a coal port was expected to yield a big cash windfall for Westar.</p>
<p>* Inco Ltd. led major miners, adding 1.50 to 45.50 on 520,000 shares. Among gold stocks, Placer Dome Inc. rose 1.20 to 29.40 on two million shares.</p>
<p>* Newbridge Networks Corp. soared 2.95 to 44.10 on 1.8 million shares amid rumors that it was in talks to set up a technology alliance with Ascend Communications. Newbridge declined comment on the rumors.</p>
