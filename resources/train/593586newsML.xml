<p>While the daughter of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori graduated from Boston University on Sunday, outside the ceremonies the parents of an American jailed in Peru demanded a fair trial for their daughter.</p>
<p>The father of Lori Berenson, 27, who was sentenced to life in prison in January 1996 for being a leader of a Peruvian rebel force, wished Keiko Fujimori well, but asked that she apply her studies at home.</p>
<p>&quot;She has had the opportunity to study in the cradle of democracy. I hope she learned her lessons in (political science) 101 well, because she has a lot to take home with her,&quot; Mark Berenson told reporters.</p>
<p>Lori Berenson was sentenced by a secret military court for treason and being a leader of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), the group that held hostages in the Japanese ambassador's residence for more than four months until April.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration, more than 100 members of Congress and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter have all backed a new trial for her.</p>
<p>Berenson's parents, other family members and a handful of friends held up placards with Lori's face outside Boston's Nickerson Field, where the commencement was held under sunny skies on Sunday.</p>
<p>A separate group of about 30 protesters demonstrated against alleged human rights abuses in Peru.</p>
<p>Keiko Fujimori, who has acted as Peru's first lady since Fujimori's split from his wife in 1995, graduated with a bachelor's degree in business administration. Her father was scheduled to be among the thousands of guests at the graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>Lori Berenson has been held in a dark, cold prison and denied visits from the International Red Cross and her lawyers for months and her health has deteriorated, her father said.</p>
<p>&quot;She's been in a dimly lit cell for 4-1/2 months and she's having trouble focusing her eyes,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The cell, where the temperatures reach a high of just 40 degrees (4 Celsius) and dip to as low as five degrees (-15 C), has nearly crippled her hands, Berenson said.</p>
<p>&quot;She lives in a refrigerator. She has the hands of an 80 year old. They are gnarled and twisted. They are grotesque,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Berenson said his daughter was never a member of the MRTA and said Fujimori should live up to the ideals of democracy and grant her a fair trial.</p>
<p>A Jesuit priest who was among the hostages in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima said in the commencement address at the university that a &quot;lasting peace&quot; to the problems in Peru or elsewhere &quot;is never won with bullets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A lasting peace can be achieved only through working to advance justice in a real democracy, respecting individuals and also institutions, incorporating everybody in a common effort to achieve meaningful human development,&quot; Father Juan Julio Wicht said.</p>
