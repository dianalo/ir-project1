<p>Precious metals prices pushed higher on Wednesday afternoon but soon encountered resistance after a firmer opening in New York, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $327.55 per ounce up from $326.40 this morning and $326.55 on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>At the fix Comex's most active December contract was $2.50 ahead at $332.20 reflecting a firm performance across the complex in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>The dollar was just under the highs against the mark/yen and Swiss franc posted in Europe and Asia when the U.S. foreign exchange markets opened.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of buying on the New York open from dealers and funds but there was plenty waiting to come in at the resistance,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Resistance between $328 and $330 has held when it has been intermittently tested over the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>It is established now as the key breakout point spot gold needs to get through before it can progress to the February and April lows of $335.70 where the market's confidence will be seriously examined, according to technical analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;That was also a 63 day moving average. It is going to be a tough number to get across,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Silver's foray was also cut off at the tested resistance in this case at $4.40 where progress has been stopped several times since the market fell below that level on July 8.</p>
<p>&quot;Silver's background is more constructive than gold's but a firmer gold price would be helpful,&quot; one dealers said.</p>
<p>Palladium has risen in a near-straight line rise since it dropped from a 17-year peak of $240.00 on June 6 to a low of $162.00 on July 10, and the advance accelerated overnight.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium held most of their overnight gains made when firmer palladium went limit up due to investor short covering on Tocom.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like they did not get that resolved in one day. They will try again tomorrow so this is no time to go short,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Funds were also reportedly buyers of palladium in Europe. &quot;They seem to be trying to take on the Russians,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Platinum was indicated at $428.50/$431.50 up $3.50 ands palladium was $$5.00 former at $207./$210.00 having fixed at $209.00 at 1300 GMT, its highest fixing July 11.</p>
<p>The firmer tone in platinum and palladium comes after Russia began shipping to Japan and Europe this month for the first time since 1996.</p>
