<p>Good weather combined with favourable prices to spur U.S. farmers to plant their largest corn and soybean crops since the 1980s, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Monday.</p>
<p>In its annual Acreage Report, the department estimated this year's corn plantings at 80.2 million acres, up 1 percent from last year and the highest since 1985.</p>
<p>The rise in soybean plantings was even more impressive.</p>
<p>Based on its survey of farmers during the first 2 weeks of June, the department estimated soybean plantings at 70.9 million, up 10 percent from 1996 and the largest since 1982.</p>
<p>In both cases, plantings were at odds with market expectations. Analysts interviewed before the report expected higher corn and lower soybean plantings than the department's survey results showed.</p>
<p>Another figure released Monday by the department helps explain the large increase in soybean plantings.</p>
<p>In its quarterly Grain Stocks report, the department pegged U.S. soybean stocks at just 499 million bushels, down 20 percent from last year.</p>
<p>Tight supplies, due to strong demand and a relatively small crop in 1996, have boosted soybean prices this year and encouraged plantings.</p>
<p>The department's soybean stock estimate was at the very low end of the range expected by grain market analysts.</p>
<p>Normally, that would provide a boost to prices, but it could be offset by the planted soybean acreage estimate, which was well above the average guess of 68.4 million acres made by analysts before the report.</p>
<p>In contrast, the department's estimate of 1997 corn plantings was substantially below the average industry estimate of 81.8 million acres.</p>
