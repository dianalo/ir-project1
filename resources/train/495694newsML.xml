<p>--------------------MARKET COMMENT----------------------------</p>
<p>* Toronto stocks ended weaker on Wednesday, but avoided Wall Street's steeper decline * Equities hit by profit-taking and jitters over interest rates * 97 million shares traded  </p>
<p>Toronto stocks ended weaker on Wednesday as jitters about interest rates and upcoming first-quarter profits weighed on Canada's largest equity market.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index fell 22.30 points to close at 5798.71 in hefty turnover of 97.5 million shares worth C$1.38 billion.</p>
<p>Declining stocks outpaced advances 575 to 365, with 272 issues unchanged. &quot;We're in a choppy market and there is still a little bit of nervousness about what the U.S. Federal Reserve will do next May,&quot; said Fred Ketchen, director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting policy committee is scheduled to hold a key meeting on May 22, when some economists expect a further hike in U.S. rates.</p>
<p>Ketchen said some investors were also wary ahead of the first-quarter earnings season that kicks off this week.</p>
<p>Shares in Alcan Aluminium Ltd were down sharply on Wednesday ahead of its first-quarter results expected on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;They are not going to measure up, many people say, to the US$0.53 a share they earned in the first quarter of 1995,&quot; Ketchen said.</p>
<p>Lower commodity prices are expected to hurt Canadian resource companies in the first quarter, but other sectors such as banking and industrials were seen having a good quarter.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Alcan fell 1.05 to close at 43.35 on 1.5 million shares. Among other base metal stocks, Inco dropped 0.70 to 42.55.</p>
<p>* Bre-X Minerals eased 0.02 to close at 2.27 on 15.9 million shares as rumors continued to swirl around its controversial Busang gold discovery.</p>
<p>* Canadian Occidental Petroleum jumped 1.65 to 26.75 after winning a takeover battle for Wascana Energy Inc.</p>
