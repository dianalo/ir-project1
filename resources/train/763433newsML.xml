<p>India's Eicher group has called off a planned car venture with Volkswagen's Skoda unit and instead advanced an expansion plan focusing on auto components, company officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Eicher, given the prevailing market opportunities, and its high growth and investment plans for the existing businesses, has decided to suspend its plans for the car project,&quot; Eicher Goodearth Ltd, the group's holding company, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Eicher had been negotiating with Czech automaker Skoda Mlada Boleslav to manufacture its Felicia model in India, but was put off by sluggish demand and long gestation lags in the car business, company officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The current changed scenario in the passenger car market ... make it rational to go ahead and take on current opportunities and not delay future commitments,&quot; Subodh Bhargava, chairman of flagship Eicher Ltd, told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said the car project, for which a memorandum of understanding had been signed in 1994 with Volkswagen AG, would have entailed an investment of 6.0 to 8.0 billion rupees ($168 million to $224 million) in a new company.</p>
<p>Over a two-year period beginning in 1998, Eicher will invest in a 2.0 billion-rupee expansion project to make motorcycles, tractors, trucks and automobile components including gears, Bhargava said.</p>
<p>He said truck maker Eicher Motors Ltd will fund more than half of the investment while the rest would be invested by the multi-product Eicher Ltd.</p>
<p>Eicher Motors, which currently makes light trucks, will now expand into heavy trucks, Bhargava said.</p>
<p>&quot;Auto components is something bigger to look for,&quot; said Bhargava, adding the company was seeking out products beyond its existing range of gears.</p>
<p>He said the expansion will include a 400 million rupee investment to make tractors of 61 horsepower (HP) capacity using technology from Finland's Valmet Oy.</p>
<p>The Valmet tractor project will produce 5,000 tractors a year at a new plant in the central Indian city of Bhopal.</p>
<p>In motorcycles, Eicher is planning to make vehicles with an engine capacity of above 624 cc, Bhargava said.</p>
<p>The expansion project, which will commence in 1998, would be in addition to an ongoing 2.0 billion rupee expansion involving 700 million rupees of investment in trucks and 1.3 billion in Eicher Ltd, he said.</p>
<p>The ongoing Eicher Ltd project involves the manufacture of 42 HP to 50 HP tractors expected to start by the end of 1997. Eicher currently makes smaller tractors of 20 to 35 HP.</p>
<p>Eicher officials said they eyed a big opportunity in the tractor industry, which recorded a growth rate of 13 percent in 1996/97 (April-March) and touched a 22 percent growth rate in the first quarter of the current 1997/98 year.</p>
<p>Eicher Ltd was formed in 1995 through the merger of Eicher Tractors Ltd, which then included gear-maker Ramon and Demm Ltd, and motorcycle-maker Royal Engield Motors Ltd.</p>
<p>The Eicher group holds 60.5 percent in the company, in which financial institutions and the public hold the rest.</p>
<p>Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp holds a minority stake of 7.5 percent in Eicher Motors. The Eicher group holds 44.5 percent and financial institutions and the general public hold the rest. ($1=35.7 rupees)</p>
