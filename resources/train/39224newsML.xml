<p>Singapore has started a movement to make random acts of kindness second nature to citizens of the bustling city-state, the Straits Times reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Small Kindness Movement aims to encourage Singaporeans to commit themselves to gracious living by performing daily acts of kindness, like giving up a parking spot to another driver.</p>
<p>The movement comes in response to Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's appeal to Singaporeans to build a gracious society even as the country strives to maintain its competitive edge.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted Noel Hon, chairman of the movement and of the Singapore Courtesy Council, as saying: &quot;Being gracious and economically competitive are not mutually exclusive.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;be kind&quot; message will initially be targeted at students and later spread to government ministries, private companies and members of the public.</p>
