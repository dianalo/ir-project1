<p>China's A and B share indices fell across the board on Friday mainly due to profit-taking on the back of negative rumours, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen B share index fell a sharp 3.67 percent to 142.17 points and the A share index slumped 2.46 percent to end at 340.42 points.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the B index fell 1.58 percent to 64.703 points while the A index dropped 2.17 percent to 937.361.</p>
<p>Among Shanghai-listed A shares, Petroleum Long Champ was the biggest loser, slipping 7.20 percent to 10.30 yuan on institutional profit-taking, .</p>
<p>On the Shenzhen A share market, selling targeted a range of recently-listed issues that had accumulated heavy gains over the past few sessions, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said profit-taking following gains on Thursday pushed the Shenzhen indices down, which also discouraged investors in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shenzhen brokers said Friday's declines were also due in part to rumours that Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping was in fragile health and that Beijing planned to launch a new crackdown on illicit stock trading.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors reduced their positions to see whether there would be any negative news on the weekend,&quot; one Shenzhen broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Falls in the A share market late in the session also triggered domestic individual selling in the B share market,&quot; a Shanghai-based broker said.</p>
<p>On the Shenzhen B share market, Great Ocean was the worst performer, falling 6.78 percent to HK$3.85 on profit-taking, brokers said.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, property developer Lujiazui was most the active trade, falling 2.56 percent to US$0.912 on volume of 3.45 million shares.</p>
<p>Trading volume for the whole market was 13.6 million shares.</p>
