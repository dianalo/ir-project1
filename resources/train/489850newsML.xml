<p>Hong Kong's anti-graft watchdog said it and the U.S. Justice Department were jointly investigating allegations of corruption and abuse of authority by a U.S. immigration official and his wife.</p>
<p>The territory's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Justice Department were investigating a Hong Kong-based U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service official and his wife, the ICAC said in a statement received by Reuters on Sunday.  </p>
<p>The statement did not name the people involved.</p>
<p>&quot;The enquiries, which are still continuing, are conducted with the full knowledge and co-operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong,&quot; it said, without giving further details.</p>
<p>The South China Morning Post newspaper said on Sunday that a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service official had been suspended as part of an international probe into the suspected smuggling of illegal immigrants from China to the United States.</p>
<p>The ICAC and the U.S. Consulate General were not immediately available to comment.</p>
