<p>World air cargo will grow at annual average rate of 6.6 percent between now and 2015 compared a yearly increase of three percent in the world economy, Boeing Co. said in its latest World Air Cargo Forecast.</p>
<p>The forecast made available here on Thursday also said that the international express market is expected to increase by an annual average of 18 percent over the period, giving it a 37 percent share of the world air cargo market, compared to only five percent in 1995.</p>
<p>This will mirror the pattern seen in the U.S. domestic market, where express shipments have grown at 25 percent a year since 1977, and now account for 60 percent of the market compared with four percent in 1977.</p>
<p>Boeing added that the world freighter market will almost double by 2015 to 2,261 planes with a net addition of more than 1,000 jet freighters. This will include some 600 new aircraft worth around $65 billion.</p>
<p>Large freighters of over 50 tonnes capacity will rise to 854 from 224 in 1995, medium freighters carrying between 30 and 50 tonnes will total 577 compared to 438 last year and smaller capacity freighter will number 830 freighters against 557.</p>
<p>Other factors governing the forecast are an expectation of constant long-term fuel prices and a long-term yield decline of one percent a year.</p>
<p>It also sees expanding express networks and airline coordination setting even higher service for traditional air freight markets.</p>
