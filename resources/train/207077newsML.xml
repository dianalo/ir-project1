<p>France and Germany moved swiftly to stamp out fears of a franc devaluation on Thursday with a joint statement implicitly rejecting a call by former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing for a depreciation in the currency.</p>
<p>In the statement, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said they had reaffirmed in a telephone conversation on Thursday that the current franc-mark rate was in line with fundamentals.</p>
<p>Their statement appears aimed at trying to close a Pandora's box opened by Giscard d'Estaing when he questioned in a magazine article on Wednesday France's &quot;stubborn&quot; determination to keep the franc tied to the mark.</p>
<p>France, he said, should declare plans to take the franc into European monetary union (EMU) at a much lower level than it is now against the dollar -- implying a sharp fall against the mark.</p>
<p>This would revive growth and help bring down unemployment, running at a record 12.6 percent.</p>
<p>His comments, which weakened the franc on Wednesday and Thursday, paved the way for debate, not only about the traditionally taboo subject of the franc-mark exchange rate, but also about France's commitment to monetary union.</p>
<p>In their brief statement, Kohl and Juppe made a point of repeating their determination to launch a single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;They reaffirmed the commitment of France and Germany to launch Economic and Monetary Union within the timetable and convergence criteria fixed by the (Maastricht) treaty,&quot; the statement, released in both Paris and Bonn, said.</p>
<p>Traditional opponents of monetary union however rushed to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>&quot;Valery Giscard d'Estaing has hit the nail on the head by stating that employment is the absolute priority,&quot; Gaullist National Assemby speaker and former anti-Maastricht campaigner Philippe Seguin said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Valery Giscard d'Estaing has put the debate on Europe back on the correct footing. The problem is no longer about whether we are going to have a single currency, but how we go about it. We cannot steer around that,&quot; Seguin told reporters.</p>
<p>Giscard d'Estaing's comments were the second time this year he has challenged the government's position on monetary union.</p>
<p>In January, he called for a softening of Maastricht treaty criteria for EMU on budget deficits to take account of weakening European growth.</p>
<p>And although he now wields little real political power, he nonetheless struck a chord in a country where the government is deeply unpopular and where people are quick to blame Maastricht criteria for weak growth and mass joblessness.</p>
<p>His comments on the franc came shortly after after former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who with Giscard d'Estaing was a founding father of the European Monetary System, slammed the Bundesbank for its insistence of a strict application of Maastricht treaty criteria.</p>
<p>The joint Franco-German statement was issued on the same day as a meeting in Bonn between Kohl and Giscard d'Estaing.</p>
