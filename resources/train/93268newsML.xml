<headline>GM strike could deal serious blow to Canada economy.</headline>

<p>A prolonged strike at General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit could damage Canada's fledgling economic recovery, potentially shaving up to one percentage point off fourth-quarter growth, government officials and analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that a strike at GM that was to last a long time would have a marked effect on the Canadian economy,&quot; Finance Minister Paul Martin told reporters after a parliamentary session.</p>
<p>Some 15,500 unionized workers at GM's Canadian unit were off the job Thursday, beginning a strike that could halt all GM Canada operations by Oct. 9.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union approved an escalating strike strategy. The strike began two hours before the midnight Wednesday deadline with workers halting production at GM's Oshawa, Ontario and Ste-Therese, Quebec, plants.</p>
<p>Other GM Canada plants were scheduled to join the strike Sunday, and all 26,000 unionized workers could be on strike by Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Each day that they are on strike, the costs begin to multiply more and more,&quot; said Douglas Porter, senior economist at Toronto-based Nesbitt Burns Inc. &quot;The longer it drags on, there will be real losses in production and that will feed into other industries such as transportation, the parts industry, but even the raw materials industry such as steel, plastics, glass.&quot;</p>
<p>The losses will be almost entirely concentrated in Ontario, Canada's richest and most populous province. One in every six jobs in the province depends directly or indirectly on the auto industry, said John McCallum, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto.</p>
<p>&quot;GM is close to half the auto industry, so something in the order of one in 12 jobs could be affected if it was a total strike for some period of time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Canada's economy, which remained stalled through the first half but began to show improved growth in the third quarter, could be hard hit if the GM strike lasts more than a month, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I've estimated that if they are out for a full month, that will shave fourth-quarter GDP growth by about a percentage point,&quot; Nesbitt's Porter said.</p>
<p>He forecast fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth at slightly more than 3.0 percent, excluding the potential effects of the GM strike.</p>
<p>That could drop to about 2.0 percent if the strike drags on, a bitter reminder of this year's first quarter, when a GM strike in the United States caused a 1.8 percent drop in Canada's merchandise exports and dampened overall growth.</p>
<p>The drop in exports led to a C$2.9 billion ($2.12 billion) trade deficit in the first quarter after a surplus of C$3.2 billion ($2.34 billion) in the fourth quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>Economists said a round of aggressive interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada will help soften the negative impact of the GM Canada strike.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy has now gotten enough momentum and the strike by itself won't choke off growth,&quot; Porter said.</p>
<p>&quot;All these reductions in interest rates suggest that we have really turned the corner and the economy is looking quite robust. So (the strike) is a negative in what's otherwise a very positive picture,&quot; McCallum added.</p>
<p>U.S. analysts said the Canadian strike could begin to affect production at GM's U.S. operations in one to two weeks. The company said Wednesday the Canadian strike would not affect its U.S. talks with the United Auto Workers Union.</p>
<p>The CAW has said its C$50 million ($36.5 million) strike fund would last for up to eight weeks and could stretch to 16 weeks if the union mortgaged properties.</p>
<p>Analysts have pegged GM's losses from the strike at $100 million to $150 million a week.</p>
<p>Canadian Labour Minister Alfonso Gagliano acknowledged the GM strike could have a &quot;tremendous&quot; effect on the Canadian economy but said there was nothing he could do to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;It is up to my provincial colleague to intervene,&quot; Gagliano told reporters, urging GM and the CAW to resolve their differences at the bargaining table.</p>
