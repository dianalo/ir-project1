<p>A full investigation will be conducted into the accident at Gretley colliery in New South Wales (NSW) near Newcastle which killed four miners on Thursday, NSW Minerals Minister Bob Martin said.</p>
<p>Martin also announced that the NSW government was proceeding with a Mines Safety Review, foreshadowed in state parliament last month.</p>
<p>The death of four miners in an apparent drowning at Gretley colliery near Newcastle brought to ten the number of deaths in NSW mines since March 1995, a spokesman for Martin said.</p>
<p>It appeared that a number of co-workers at Gretley, about 100 metres from the coalface, were washed by the floodwaters which drowned the four miners, he said.</p>
<p>The flood reached a height one foot (30 cm) from the ceiling of the tunnel, he said, adding: &quot;They are lucky to be alive.&quot;</p>
<p>The minister's spokesman confirmed that the accident occurred at a depth of 120 metres but said dimensions of the tunnel were presently unknown.</p>
<p>A full mine investigation would be conducted by the minister into the accident, he said.</p>
<p>The Mines Inspectorate branch of the Department of Mineral Resources was conducting an immediate investigation separate but aligned to the Mines Safety Review, he said.</p>
<p>The mine in the Hunter Valley, Australia's second largest coal district, is owned by Oakbridge Ltd. Oakbridge is 42-percent owned by the U.S. Cyprus Amax mining group, the second largest coal producer in the United States, which has been expanding its coal operations in Australia.</p>
