<headline>STOCKS -- Closing stock market indices, May 27.</headline>

<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Tuesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's FTSE 100 share index edged closer to its record peak, lifted by a buoyant bank sector. But trading volume was light, with many dealings rooms thinned out on the back of the long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The leading blue chip index finished 19.8 points higher at 4,681.6, just 12.3 points off its all-time closing high set on May 16.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares confounded talk of an imminent correction on Tuesday as they took heart from the dollar's gains and good corporate news to set more records, albeit on what traders called disappointing volumes.</p>
<p>The DAX index advanced 16.50 points, or 0.45 percent to set a new record close of 3,674.36 points, marking an advance of 2.6 percent since Thursday and a 6.9 percent surge this month. In post-bourse trade the DAX stood at 3,665.43 down 3.88 points.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed just below their day's high on Tuesday but with a big gain after Monday's four percent fall on a shock election gain for the left.</p>
<p>A softer Wall Street, depressed by stronger than expected May U.S. consumer confidence, did not derail the French advance.</p>
<p>Investors were awaiting a televised address from President Jacques Chirac during the evening after Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on Monday he would not return to office even if the centre-right won the second round of the parliamentary election on Sunday.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index closed up 25.6 points, or 0.96 percent, at 2,680.34.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss share prices ended slightly lower despite the fact that most actively traded Roche certificates posted a 1.4 percent gain.</p>
<p>Prices were pressured in late trade by a weaker Wall Street opening and U.S. consumer confidence data which was at a 28-year high, raising fears of higher interest rates. Further developments would depend on the U.S. market, traders said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) was down 6.7 points, or 0.13 percent, to 5,190.0. The broad SPI ended off 3.40 points at 3,281.28.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed moderately lower, as leading exporters remained weighed down by caution over the currency market, brokers said.</p>
<p>Many participants retreated to the sidelines, waiting for clearer direction from the market. Trade was subdued due to the absence of foreign investors and domestic dealers, they said.</p>
<p>The 225-share Nikkei average lost 153.61 points or 0.77 percent to finish at 19,889.89.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks closed easier on heavy volume after profit-taking outweighed index futures-linked buying which had pushed the Hang Seng Index to a record high of 14,618.36 in early trade.</p>
<p>The blue-chip index fell 34.48 points, or 0.24 percent, to finish at 14,540.16.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - A further fall in heavyweight Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd shares pushed the Australian share market to a softer finish on Tuesday, ending a run of record highs.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries Index ended down 5.9 points at 2,578.9, due almost entirely to the fall in BHP, traders said.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares ended very slightly weaker amid large volumes. The market was weighed in late trade by a softer start on Wall Street, dealers said.</p>
<p>The all-share index was down 2.2 points to 7,056.3 points, the industrial index was down 0.3 points to 8,319.3 points and the gold index shed 2.3 points to 1,186.5 points.</p>
