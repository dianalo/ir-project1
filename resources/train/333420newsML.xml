<p>A Serb mob attacked Moslems delivering construction materials to a village on the Serb side of Bosnia's ethnic boundary line which is being resettled by Moslems, witnesses said on Sunday.</p>
<p>They said tractor driver Semsudin Mujic, 34, was beaten after being stopped on Saturday by a group of 100 armed men with crowbars on a road to the northeast Bosnian village of Gajevi, near a Russian peacekeepers' checkpoint.</p>
<p>Mujic was treated at the medical centre in nearby Koraj, on the Moslem-Croat Federation side of the so-called Inter-Entity Boundary Line (IEBL) and later released, nurses said.</p>
<p>Moslem workers, who had come to set up temporary housing for refugees, said several others were also attacked.</p>
<p>The NATO-led peace Stabilisation Force (SFOR) said one man suffered &quot;minor injuries&quot; after a Serb hit him in the face and said the Serb crowd had stolen some construction materials.</p>
<p>Gajevi was the scene last November of the worst clash between Moslems and Serbs since the Dayton peace treaty on Bosnia was signed in December 1995. Rocket-propelled grenades were used in the disturbance, in which one person died.</p>
<p>There have been a series of clashes along the boundary line as Moslem refugees have tried to cross it to return to their pre-war homes in Serb territory.</p>
<p>In some cases SFOR discovered Moslems were arriving armed with the help of Bosnian army soldiers.</p>
<p>For the return to Gajevi, the Moslems submitted to a vetting procedure supervised by international agencies to confirm those moving back held property in the village before the war.</p>
<p>Mujic was transporting construction equipment to Gajevi when his tractor was ambushed, Moslem witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;After passing through the SFOR checkpoint, the Serbs started to beat the tractor driver with crowbars. Everything happened in front of (SFOR) soldiers who did not react at all,&quot; said witness Muharem Aljic.</p>
<p>The Moslem refugees also accused U.S. and Russian SFOR troops in the area of failing to take action to try to force the Serb crowd to disperse.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Serbs) provoke us to attack them but we are calm and we do not want to do that. We respect the (resettlement) procedure and we will wait to see what SFOR will do,&quot; said Fadil Banjanovic, a federation refugee official.</p>
<p>U.S. Sergeant Marianne Mirabella, a spokeswoman for SFOR, told Reuters it was up to Serb authorities to provide police protection and not the multinational peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>&quot;Security in Republika Srpska (the Serb Republic of Bosnia) is surely not the responsibility of SFOR. That's the responsibility of Republika Srpska police. They ought to be ashamed,&quot; she said by telephone from Tuzla.</p>
<p>&quot;They failed to do their job, which is to enforce law and order. They didn't do that.&quot;</p>
<p>The incident did not fall within SFOR's mandate as the crowd that showed up were not carrying guns or other weapons which would violate terms of the peace agreement, she said.</p>
<p>The construction work would resume after SFOR holds talks with local Moslem and Serb authorities to reduce the risk of violence, she said.</p>
