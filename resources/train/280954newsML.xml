<p>A bomb ripped through a packed passenger train in India's northeastern state of Assam on Monday and officials feared there were many deaths, the United News of India (UNI) said.</p>
<p>UNI said the blast destroyed three carriages of the Delhi-bound Brahmaputra Mail near Kokrajhar in Assam, one of seven northeastern states wracked by decades of ethnic and separatist violence.  </p>
<p>UNI said three other carriages and the locomotive were derailed by the explosion.</p>
<p>The blast came a day after tribal Bodo guerrillas blew up a road bridge that formed the main link between India's northeast regions and the rest of the country, injuring seven people.</p>
<p>A police officer told Reuters on Monday that Bodo rebels had blasted the bridge over a small river at Rakhaldubi, between the towns of Bijni and Bongaigaon on National Highway 31 in the tea and oil-rich state of Assam.</p>
<p>Activists representing Bodo tribesmen living north of the Brahmaputra river want a homeland within India in the state of Assam, but an extremist fringe, the Bodoland Army, has been fighting for a separate nation since 1989.</p>
