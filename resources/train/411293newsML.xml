<p>Cambridge Antibody Technology Group (CAT) said it expected trading in its shares to start on March 25 after a placing with institutional investors will close the week before.</p>
<p>The company, established in 1990 after its founders developed a technology to isolate human antibodies, hopes to raise about 35 million stg for drug development trials and staff expansion. CAT currently employs about 67 people.</p>
<p>The money should be enough to meet CAT's spending needs to about the year 2000, finance director John Aston said.</p>
<p>&quot;It should keep us going for two to three years,&quot; he told a told a news conference.</p>
<p>CAT, which has already struck partnerships with drug giants such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly &amp; Co and BASF AG, said it expects to have a market capitalisation of around 85 to 100 million stg.</p>
<p>The quality and breadth of its partners should help investors be confident of CAT's potential, the company's chief executive, David Chiswell, said.</p>
<p>CAT said its competitive edge stems from a database of human antibodies, which are produced by cells in the immune system to help combat bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>From its database, CAT can quickly and cheaply identify the antibodies that could form the basis for drugs, for which pharmaceutical companies see a potential market.</p>
<p>Drug development from mice antibodies, as done by competitors such as Celltech Group Plc and Centocor Inc of the U.S., would take longer as these products would not be as easily tolerated by the human body, CAT said.</p>
<p>Most of the drug developement costs stem from the clinial trials, which begin after an antibody is manipulated to effectively fight a target disease.</p>
<p>CAT is currently developing a drug against rheumatoid arthritis with BASF, which will start clinical trials in the second quarter of this year. A similar drug against Crohn's disease, a poorly treated illness in the small intestine, will go into trials later this year.</p>
<p>Other programmes include drugs to improve the success of operations for detached retina and gluacoma, while the company hopes to have drugs for cancer and obesity in clinic in 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>CAT aims to remain responsible for bigger portions of future development programmes so that it can reap more of the financial benefits from the end-product once it is sold on the market.</p>
