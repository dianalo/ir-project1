<p>The first-half profits slump experienced by Imperial Chemical Industries Plc (ICI) is expected to have worsened in the third quarter after a continued deterioration in polyester prices, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>ICI is expected to report pre-tax profits of between 127.0 million stg and 140.0 million stg on Thursday, compared with 216 million stg in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>ICI has suffered a series of full-year earnings downgrades by analysts over the past few weeks, putting pressure on its share price, as hopes for a recovery in profitability in the remainder of 1996 faded.  </p>
<p>A substantial setback at its industrial chemicals operations, whose products include ethylene, polyester intermediates and titanium dioxide, has led the decline. The division accounted for around half of all profits last year.</p>
<p>One analyst who asked not to be identified said &quot;the big question is the size of the drop on the polyester side.&quot;</p>
<p>The analyst said polyester has been a &quot;classic cyclical situation&quot; with rapid rises in prices encouraging players to greatly boost production and then flooding the market.  </p>
<p>Kleinwort Benson analyst Jeremy Chantry, who expects pretax profit of 140 million stg, said analysts would be focusing &quot;on the extent of the deterioration in profits in the polyester chain and also pigments.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he saw little prospect of a recovery before 1997 and added &quot;polyester may not deteriorate further but I think it will be a long haul back to profitability.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts will also be watching for signs of the impact of rising oil prices and stronger sterling on the group, with slippage in the Deutsche Mark in particular eroding ICI's competitive advantage against European rivals.</p>
<p>In a note on the sector, analysts at BZW Research Ltd said they did not believe that commodity markets are set to worsen further, but argued that improved selling prices will not &quot;significantly boost profits before 1997.&quot;</p>
