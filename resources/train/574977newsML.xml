<headline>GM faces strike deadline at Ohio plants.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>General Motors Corp's labor troubles threatened to escalate Monday as a third strike deadline drew closer, this time at the automaker's wiring harness facilities in Warren, Ohio.</p>
<p>GM, already battling strikes at two assembly plants, is facing a strike deadline of 0001 EDT/0401 GMT Tuesday by 8,600 members of the International Union of Electronics Workers Local 717 at 16 Delphi Packard Electric Systems plants in the northeastern Ohio city.</p>
<p>A prolonged walkout at the plants could cripple much of GM's North American vehicle production, since all GM vehicles use Delphi Packard Electric wiring harnesses and power and signal distribution components. Although Delphi Packard Electric assembles many wiring harnesses in Mexico, they use components produced at the Warren facilities.</p>
<p>Deborah Ayers, a spokeswoman for the GM division, said negotiators are still hoping to reach an agreement before the deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still talking,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Although GM has been hit with several strikes over local labor contracts at individual plants, the Delphi Packard Electric facilities are covered under a local agreement that never expires. Nonetheless, the union is threatening to strike over a number of grievances, including demands for jobs and changes to the three-tier wage scale.</p>
<p>Local 717 members rejected a tentative pact in March, saying that they wanted the company to abolish the third wage tier, which pays workers 55 percent of full wages.</p>
<p>Talks also continued with little progress Monday in efforts to end strikes in Pontiac, Mich., which began April 22 and in Oklahoma City, which began April 4.</p>
<p>The Pontiac plant is one of three North American factories that produce GM's full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks, while the Oklahoma City plant builds the Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile cutlass mid-size sedans.</p>
