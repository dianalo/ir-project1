<p>Tens of thousands of opposition supporters converged on a river bridge in the centre of the Serbian capital on Sunday in a tense stand-off with anti-riot police.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the confrontation began when several hundred police in helmets and carrying shields and batons took up position on the Brankov bridge on a bend in the Sava river and linking old and new quarters of Belgrade.</p>
<p>Demonstrations, now in their 78th day, show no signs of losing their impetus as cracks start to appear in the hitherto monolithic socialist government of President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p>The protesters demand that Milosevic recognise opposition victories in local elections last November.</p>
<p>Sunday's police cordon, several hundred strong, held up a relatively small contingent of a few hundred marchers led by opposition politician Vuk Draskovic, who tried to negotiate his way through police lines.</p>
<p>But the police commander told Draskovic to pull back, according to radio stations. Some marchers did partly withdraw.</p>
<p>&quot;Do we need a passport to enter Belgrade?&quot; Draskovic asked. He stood within a few metres (yards) of police lines, the witnesses said.</p>
<p>Swiftly, as news spread on the students' own local radio, much larger groups turned away from their original rallying point for the past 78 days of protests -- a central square -- and headed for the road and pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p>Many thousands ended up at the far end of the bridge in the old quarter of town, and were held up by police reinforcements.</p>
<p>Police also took up position in sidestreets and clambered up stairs to reinforce their comrades on the bridge.</p>
<p>It was not at all clear why the police should have taken up position on the bridge. They left other avenues in the old city wide open. Their move served to stop traffic, and acted like a magnet on the demonstrators, drawing tens of thousands of them to the scene.</p>
<p>Some central streets in the old part of town had no police presence whatsover, to the demonstrators' surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Our demonstrations are peaceful and will remain peaceful,&quot; opposition leader Zoran Djindjic told the crowd. &quot;But there will be no deals, we are defending our right to peaceful demonstration.&quot;</p>
<p>Both opposition and student protests, held after dark on Sunday, were in cheerful mood despite the sub-zero cold.</p>
<p>Under the relentless pressure of daily protests, fissures have been opening up within Serbia's increasingly discredited state establishment.</p>
<p>The junior New Democracy party in Milosevic's leftist coalition is openly calling for opposition election wins to be reinstated. Senior churchmen and soldiers demand the same.</p>
<p>In the town of Jagodina bickering between the president's Socialist Party (SPS) and his wife's Yugoslav United Left (JUL) has prevented them from forming a local government.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 schools are shut, teachers are on strike, universities are in turmoil and lawyers are rallying in the streets for democratic reforms.</p>
<p>Violence has erupted in the Serbian-ruled province of Kosovo, long a powder keg of communal tension after Milosevic cancelled the region's autonomy in 1989 on the grounds that the majority ethnic Albanians were prepasring to secede.</p>
<p>On Friday Serbian police shot dead three ethnic Albanians state television denounced as outlaws and one of the victims, according to the official news agency Tanjug, was a separatist guerrilla commander.</p>
<p>However Kosovo's main ethnic Albanian political party said the killings were part of a brutal Serbian crackdown in the area and appealed to the international community for help.</p>
