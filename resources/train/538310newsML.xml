<p>It's not that the &quot;Fight Doctor&quot; hates George Foreman personally. Ferdie Pacheco hates the example the 48-year-old fighter is setting for other older boxers who have been tempted to risk their lives by going back to taking punches for pay.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreman's opening the barn door to all these ex-champs to come back,&quot; said Pacheco, who dubbed himself &quot;The Fight Doctor&quot; in the days when he ministered to Muhammad Ali when the great champion ruled the heavyweight world. That was before Pacheco quit Ali's corner after failing to convince him to retire.</p>
<p>&quot;When George came back and got millions, they decided they'd come back for some big paydays,&quot; Pacheco said Thursday in an interview from his home in Tampa, Florida.</p>
<p>Foreman, 75-4, is a slight underdog in the fight against the 31-year-old Savarese (36-0). If Foreman, who will be paid about $4 million compared to Savarese's $500,000, wins he can be expected to angle for millions more against the winner of the June 28 Evander Holyfield-Mike Tyson rematch.</p>
<p>Considering the quality of his recent opponents, Foreman hardly qualifies for a title fight. That's particularly obvious in light of his refusals of mandatory fights -- most likely because he thought they would be too tough -- after winning two titles in 1994, leading to his being stripped of his crowns. He has fought twice since.</p>
<p>And Savarese's opponents have been less than formidable.</p>
<p>Pacheco used Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson, generally considered the best pound-for-pound fighter ever, as examples of the dangers of older men fighting.</p>
<p>Before he died, Robinson suffered acutely from the effects of taking all those punches over a very long career. And Ali sufferes from Parkinson's Syndrome, which very noticeably affects his motor skills and speech.</p>
<p>&quot;No one can take a look at Sugar Ray Robinson and Ali and not see that you're gonna pay the bill eventually, all the tissue you're damaging,&quot; Pacheco said.</p>
<p>&quot;George (Foreman) has the same brain as everyone else. You jar a brain that is soft Jell-O in a hard cover, you're gonna break little blood vessels,&quot; Pacheco said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some serious people have beat him up,&quot; said Pacheco, referring to Foreman's tough fights in recent years against Evander Holyfield, Alex Stewart and Michael Moorer.</p>
<p>Knocking out the congenitally inattentive Moorer in the 10th round in 1994 with a sledgehammer right hand that arrived with all the speed of a dirigible -- making Foreman the oldest heavyweight champion ever -- may have been the worst thing for Foreman and other older fighters as far as Pacheco is concerned.</p>
<p>Pacheco, who works as a boxing commentator for Showtime cable television -- a rival to HBO, which employs Foreman in a similar capacity -- says he was opposed to Foreman coming out of retirement in 1987, &quot;not because I didn't think he could do well but because I thought he could succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;He had that big punch, and I thought he would do okay and it would only encourage other old fighters to come back.&quot;</p>
<p>The list of former fighters who have returned to the ring or are considering comebacks include 47-year-old former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, who is admittedly fighting just for the money 24 years after he turned professional.</p>
<p>Former cruiserweight champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi is coming back at 44, saying, &quot;if (Foreman) can do it, I can. George has influenced and inspired me.&quot; And Saoul Mamby, soon to be 50, is also returning.</p>
<p>Then there is Sugar Ray Leonard, 41 next month, who embarrassed himself in a loss last month to Hector Camacho and says he will fight again. Roberto Duran, one of the greatest lightweights ever, is still fighting in his 40s.</p>
<p>And, Pacheco says, if a promoter dangles some money in front of a lot of other old fighters they would jump through the ropes faster than Don King could say, &quot;Only in America.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All of this is singularly due to George's big punch,&quot; said Pacheco, who feels boxing commissions should deny licenses to older fighters on grounds of age alone, regardless of their apparent health.</p>
<p>&quot;Boxing, if it were well done would be exhilarating,&quot; Pacheco said. &quot;But it's run like a banana republic. If you got the money and the relatives you got the fight.&quot;</p>
<p>And the potential brain damage.</p>
