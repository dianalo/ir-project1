<p>President Bill Clinton and members of his second-term Cabinet convened on Saturday on a day-long retreat to discuss their agenda for the next four years.</p>
<p>On a chilly, snowy morning, Clinton crossed Pennsylvania Avenue on foot to Blair House for the session. Included in the retreat were officials designated for Cabinet positions in the second term, holdovers from the first term as well as outgoing Cabinet secretaries.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the retreat would include working sessions on the budget and the economy, America's leadership role in the world, and improving U.S. education and the environment.</p>
<p>McCurry said Clinton would be looking to get a sense of how his second-term team was going to work together.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a very productive and engaging session in which the president gets many insights from his Cabinet members,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
