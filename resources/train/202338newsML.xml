<p>A 33.3 percent stake in Russian oil company NK Yukos, held in trust by Bank Menatep, will be sold at an investment tender in one lot, a bank official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Menatep Group press secretary Natalya Mandrova told Reuters that because of the requirement to invest $200 million in Yukos projects over the next two years, the shares had to be sold in one consolidated stake.</p>
<p>This means foreign investors, who may not hold more than 15 percent of a Russian oil company, will not be able to take part in the tender.</p>
<p>Mandrova said the group's decision to sell the stake, which it won in an auction under the government's shares-for-loans scheme last December, was closely linked to the high level of integration between Menatep and Yukos.</p>
<p>ZAO Laguna, a company backed by Menatep won the right to manage a state-owned stake 45 percent of Yukos in the shares-for-loans scheme in exchange for a $159 million loan to the government. It also won 33 percent in an investment tender with a bid of $150.125 million.</p>
<p>It acquired a further seven percent of Yukos at an auction in May this year.</p>
<p>Senior officials of each company sit on the other's board.</p>
<p>Mandrova said the 45 percent stake had been reduced to 33.3 percent by a rights issue which raised Yukos's authorised capital by 26 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Our decision to sell this stake is mainly tied to the fact that we have already achieved a high level of integration. This stake is to a great extent no longer useful to us,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the investment tender, the starting price for the shares would be $160 million.</p>
<p>After the rights issue, the Rosprom group, which unites Menatep's industrial holdings, has a controlling 52 percent stake. ZAO Russkiye Investory, which Mandrova said represented Rosprom, acquired a 12.79 percent share of Yukos in the issue.</p>
<p>Mandrova said that any decision relating to the stake acquired in the shares for loans auction involved negotiations with government officials.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to hide the fact that we are selling this stake with the aim of attracting money,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Winners of the shares for loans auctions have been free to sell the shares since September 1. Once the original loan is repaid, auction winners can keep 30 percent of the proceeds and 70 percent goes to the government.</p>
<p>Mandrova said Menatep's profit would be reinvested in Yukos.</p>
<p>Yukos's main operating unit is AO Yuganskneftegaz, of which it holds 51 percent.</p>
<p>Yuganskneftegaz shares stood at $10.10 on the Russian Trading System at 1320 GMT, after closing on Tuesday at $9.73.</p>
