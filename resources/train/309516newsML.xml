<p>IntraNet Solutions Inc said Wednesday it expects to report revenues of about $6.1 million for its fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 1996, an increase of 60 percent over revenues of $3.8 million for the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>This also represents an increase of 50 percent over revenues of $4.1 million for its fiscal second quarter ended September 30, 1996.  </p>
<p>The company said complete results for the third quarter will be released in February.</p>
<p>&quot;Our business was very strong in the third quarter. The increase in revenues was driven both by growth from existing customers and by new business,&quot; said Robert Olson, chief executive officer of IntraNet Solutions, in a statement.</p>
<p>IntraNet also repeated it expects to operate at a loss for the balance of its fiscal year. &quot;As we have previously announced, we expect to continue to operate at a loss for the quarter and the year ending March 31, 1997, as we invest in the facilities and infrastructure to support a much larger business in the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>IntraNet helps companies design and implement systems for managing and distributing business-critical information contained in documents within and outside the company.</p>
