<headline>American Express realigns some business units.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>American Express Co. said Thursday it was reorganizing some of its financial and business units to streamline operations.</p>
<p>The company also said Bill Heron has decided to resign as president of American Express Financial Direct, but he will stay on to help with the transition until a successor is named.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the changes are designed to place businesses that serve similar markets under common management and enable us to serve customers more effectively,&quot; Chairman and Chief Executive Harvey Golub and President Ken Chenault said in a letter to employees.</p>
<p>In the realignment, American Express Financial Direct will become part of American Express Financial Advisors. American Express Tax &amp; Business Services (TBS) will become a part of American Express Small Business Services.</p>
<p>The TBS unit had been part of Workplace Financial Services, which will be disbanded and its operations shifted elsewhere.</p>
<p>Financial Direct, which includes an online brokerage service, was set up as a stand-alone business in May 1996.</p>
<p>Referring to Financial Direct, Golub and Chenault said in the memo there is a need &quot;to expand our product offerings and attract new customers to the franchise more quickly than we have.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares of American Express rose $1.19 to $78.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
