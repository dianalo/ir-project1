<p>Armed North Korean commandos who sneaked across the border in a Shark-class submarine last month have inadvertently struck a blow at relations between the United States and South Korea.</p>
<p>Many South Koreans feel betrayed by Washington's measured response to the incursion, citing it as further evidence of a policy of appeasement towards North Korea.</p>
<p>The commando incursion itself was badly botched, but angry newspaper editorials suggest that relations between the United States and one of its closest Asian allies are now as high and dry as the submarine that ended up stuck on a reef.</p>
<p>&quot;The Korea-U.S. relationship has now run aground on the rocks of emotionalism, haughtiness, distrust and lack of dialogue,&quot; the Chosun Ilbo daily said last week.</p>
<p>The Hankuk Ilbo daily chided Washington for &quot;using carrots alone, while hiding the stick behind its back&quot;. The result, it said, was &quot;weak-kneed diplomacy&quot;.</p>
<p>Of 26 North Korean who came ashore, 22 have been killed or found dead, while a handful of South Korean soldiers have died as the search for the armed infiltrators continues.</p>
<p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord is due in South Korea on Thursday to discuss the incursion and patch up differences.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Seoul say Washington's top Asia diplomat has a tough assignment. His task will be to urge restraint on South Korea while anti-Pyongyang sentiment is running high.</p>
<p>Although the United States and South Korea fought side-by-side against North Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War, their relationship is bedevilled by mistrust.</p>
<p>Bubbling underneath the surface are South Korean fears that the United States is plotting to betray its ally from one of history's bloodiest conflicts and make peace with the vanquished communists in the North.</p>
<p>The media have accused U.S. President Bill Clinton of going soft on North Korea to try to keep the peace on the Korean peninsula at any cost in an election year.</p>
<p>South Korea is determined to make Pyongyang pay for the intrusion. President Kim Young-sam has threatened to cut off aid to North Korea, where millions are going hungry, and has declared South Korea is ready for &quot;all-out war&quot;.</p>
<p>Seoul has been prodding the U.N. Security Council to take a tough stand against Pyongyang's threats of &quot;merciless retaliation&quot; for the deaths of its agents.</p>
<p>In a gesture that has heightened alarm, security has been stepped up at South Korea airports and ports amid warnings of terrorist action by Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some frustration in the State Department. They feel South Korea has gone a bit too far,&quot; said one envoy.</p>
<p>He added that U.S. administration officials believed South Korea was exaggerating the threat.</p>
<p>Lord will be counselling &quot;cool heads&quot; to keep alive prospects of peace talks with Pyongyang proposed by Clinton and Kim, and preserve a 1994 accord under which Pyongyang agreed to freeze its nuclear weapons programme.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the visit was intended to &quot;demonstrate our very close alliance with South Korea, the fact that we stand by South Korea in the midst of these provocations by North Korea&quot;.</p>
<p>The strength of that commitment was questioned by sceptical South Koreans after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher called on &quot;all parties&quot; to show restraint.</p>
<p>The Chosun Ilbo newspaper accused Washington of &quot;keeping a distance from South Korea&quot; and &quot;moving towards a middle-of-the-road position&quot;.</p>
