<p>Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee said on Wednesday the government would likely finalise decisions on new Thai insurance licences within the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Narongchai told foreign businessmen at a chamber of commerce function a nine-member committee would soon make the long-awaited decisions which had been repeatedly delayed during the two previous Thai governments.</p>
<p>He said the committee would include five people from the private sector, who would make transparent decisions to avoid charges of unfair lobbying.</p>
<p>&quot;They are honest people. There is no need for lobbying or (applicants) preparing to make special donations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The remainder of the committee would consist of members of the Commerce Ministry.</p>
<p>Thailand's previous government last year picked 66 new life and non-life licence bidders out of 87 applicants but the then coalition government of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa was dissolved before the licences were issued.</p>
<p>The 66 bidders included 35 who applied for life insurance business and 31 seeking non-life insurance licences.</p>
<p>Narongchai told reporters earlier on Wednesday that the panel may either call a new round of bidding or review the previous 66 winners.</p>
<p>Industry sources have mostly viewed the number of accepted applicants as too high. They said a decision to license all of them would have a significant impact on the 101 billion baht ($4.0 billion) Thai insurance market which grew 20 percent in 1995.</p>
