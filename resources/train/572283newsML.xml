<title>SOUTH KOREA: Seoul won ends lower on central bank intervention.</title>
<headline>Seoul won ends lower on central bank intervention.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-05-09</dateline>

<p>The won closed lower against the U.S. currency after the central bank stepped into the interbank market twice on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the Bank of Korea bought dollars at 891.20 before the morning close and at 892.30 in the afternoon session.</p>
<p>The central bank's intervention was seen as slowing the won's rise, which was sparked by the dollar's fall against the yen in world markets.</p>
<p>The won finished at 893.10, compared with Thursday's close of 892.90. Before the intervention, the won rose to 890.80 on the dollar's weakness versus the yen.  </p>
<p>But a finance ministry official said it was too early to say the dollar had begun falling against the yen. He also said it was not necessary for the won/dollar rate to fluctuate in line with dollar/yen rate from a short-term point of view.</p>
<p>Dealers forecast the dollar would hover around the 890 won level for the time being.</p>
<p>Trading volume was estimated at $2.03 billion won.</p>
<p>Monday's mid-rate is expected to be pegged at 892.20 against 894.10 today.</p>
