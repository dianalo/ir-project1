<p>The Kremlin's crusade against massive tax dodging, which it sees as a major threat to national security, ran on Thursday into resistance from an influential regional leader who said he might disobey Moscow's orders.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Mintimer Shaimiyev, leader of the independent-minded autonomous region of Tatarstan, as saying the widely-publicised campaign to boost tax collection was doomed.</p>
<p>&quot;A feverish struggle for taxes and vain attempts to collect them remind us of the stagnation (the last years of the communist regime),&quot; Shaimiyev said, referring to Moscow's threats to launch bankruptcy proceedings against guilty firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, as then, they are trying to get more milk from chronically undernourished cows.&quot;</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin, worried by endemic corporate tax dodging, this month set up an extraordinary commission to tackle the crisis. Moscow has focused criticism on the huge KamAZ truck plant, one of the mainstays of Tatarstan's economy.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin held the first meeting of the commission on Tuesday after parliament had rejected a draft 1997 budget. He said that the government either had to force tax dodgers to pay up or change economic and social policies.</p>
<p>A desperate cash shortage has led to widespread wage delays, poor funding of the armed forces and lack of finance for many social programmes. The government has expressed concern that the severe cash crisis could prompt civil unrest.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Livshits said after the tax meeting that tough sanctions would be taken against dodgers including bankruptcies, hitherto seldom used in Russia.</p>
<p>Ministers this week named KamAZ as one of four big tax evaders and said it was in line for bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Shaimiyev said KamAZ, hit by a huge fire in 1993 and exempt from taxes for three years, could not be among the dodgers.</p>
<p>He told Interfax the campaign was ill-considered and warned that any action taken without agreement of his administration against Tatarstan-based firms would not be obeyed.</p>
<p>&quot;Such decisions would contradict the treaty on separation of powers signed between Tatarstan and Russia,&quot; Shaimiyev said. &quot;Such actions by the federal centre will have no consequences in the republic,&quot; he said</p>
<p>Moscow officials have described Tatarstan, which struck a power-sharing deal with Moscow in 1993 that gave the oil-rich region strong autonomy from Russia, as a model of harmony between national and regional interests.</p>
<p>The example of Tatarstan has become even more important for the Kremlin since it launched a bid in late 1994 to quell by force independence moves by the southern region of Chechnya.</p>
<p>Tatarstan, one of the 89 regions and ethnic regions and republics which form the Russian Federation, is among 10 regions which make a net contribution to the national budget rather than expecting donations from it.</p>
<p>Most Russian regions are currently holding local elections and many candidates standing for governor cite Tatarstan as an example of how a province should deal with federal authorities.</p>
<p>Shaimiyev told Interfax that Moscow owed the region some 300 billion roubles ($60 million) and hinted that any campaign should start with the federal centre paying its debts.</p>
