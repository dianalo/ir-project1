<p>European Union finance ministers, facing mounting criticism over their inability to curb a steady rise in unemployment, met on Monday to review economic conditions in the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>The ministers are focusing on the European Commission's annual economic report, which urges governments to adopt greater labour market flexibility to fight double-digit unemployment.</p>
<p>Speaking before the meeting, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said continental economies had to bring their policies more in line with those in Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;They've got to make rather a lot more labour market changes to come rather more in line with British practices,&quot; Clarke told reporters, saying that Britain had the best performing economy in the EU.</p>
<p>In its lengthy review, the EU's executive forecast last week that faster economic growth would have only a limited impact on the current 10.8 percent EU jobless rate.</p>
<p>&quot;The moderate strengthening of employment growth in the Community in the coming years is expected to be sufficient to achieve only a modest reduction in unemployment,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Europe's jobless problem has been highlighted as Germany, the EU's main economic engine, struggles with nearly 4.7 million unemployed, the highest level since the 1930s.</p>
<p>The record unemployment rate has raised doubts over Bonn's ability to cut expenditure and bring its budget deficit within the Maastricht treaty's target.</p>
<p>Under growing political pressure, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel has not yet announced how he plans to deal with an expected shortfall in revenue.</p>
<p>Independent economists have reckoned that the high unemployment rate would add between 10 billion and 18 billion marks ($6-11 billion) to German government spending.</p>
<p>Germany's woes have also rekindled speculation of a delay to the single currency's launch date, expected in 1999.</p>
<p>The link between the drive EU governments are making towards a common currency and unemployment has in turn become more controversial, with many seeing politicians handicapped in their ability to follow pro-labour market policies.</p>
<p>Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker, however, played down any connection between fiscal austerity and joblessness, stressing the need for new policies.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to bring down non-wage labour costs and labour taxes,&quot; Juncker, who is also finance minister, told reporters.</p>
<p>Separately, the finance ministers are expected to endorse the efforts Belgium has made towards meeting the Maastricht treaty's criteria on deficits, interest rates and inflation.</p>
<p>In March, the ministers will review new economic convergence plans from Germany and France. ($ = 1.692 German Marks)</p>
