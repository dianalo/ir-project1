<p>Former finance minister P. Chidambaram's regional party said it would announce on Tuesday whether or not it will join Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's new government.</p>
<p>The head of the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), G.K. Moopanar, planned to hold a news conference at 5 p.m. (1130 GMT) in the southern city of Madras to announce the decision, party officials said.  </p>
<p>The TMC announced on April 19 that it had tentatively decided to stay out of Gujral's government after Moopanar was passed over by the ruling United Front coalition in its choice of a new leader and prime minister.</p>
<p>TMC leaders authorised Moopanar on Sunday to take a decision on behalf of the party, the third largest component in the 15-party United Front with 20 of the alliance's 178 deputies in the 545-member lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Most TMC leaders were opposed to entering the government and favoured concentrating on fighting their rival, Tamil Nadu state's ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), but senior officials said it was up to Moopanar to judge whether it was in the national interest to join Gujral's team.</p>
<p>Financial markets were watching keenly to see if the TMC would return to the government as in that case Chidambaram was expected to be asked to continue as finance minister and pilot the 1997/98 (April-March) budget through parliament which reconvenes on Wednesday.</p>
