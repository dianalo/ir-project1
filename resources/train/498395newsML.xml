<p>U.S.-based Trinova Corporation's Vickers Inc aims to grow its Asia Pacific sales to US$500 million within five years from about $100 million now, company officials said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have a very ambitious growth plan. Our goal is to grow Vickers' sales in Asia Pacific to US$500 million within five years and become the leading fluid power and motion control solutions provider in Asia,&quot; Vickers' president John Weber said at a briefing on its establishment of an Asian headquarters in Singapore.</p>
<p>Vickers makes hydraulic and electric components for the aerospace, automotive, industrial and electronics industries.</p>
<p>In Asia, most of its customers are in the industrial and electronics industries, company officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>Significant growth is expected from piston pumps, the &quot;heart of the hydraulic systems which drives engines&quot; and products for mobile applications like in tractors for agricultural use.</p>
<p>&quot;With these ambitious growth plans we have, Asia operations will be more important than our traditional base in North America,&quot; Weber said.</p>
<p>&quot;In five to six years, we expect Asia's contribution to be comparable to North America's contribution,&quot; he said. He declined to reveal neither Vickers' revenue nor its Asian contribution.</p>
<p>Vice president Edward Neiheisel said Vickers would be announcing &quot;a major global alliance in Tokyo this Friday&quot;.</p>
<p>Neiheisel said that the global hydraulic industry was valued at US$15 billion, of which Asia and North America contributed US$5 billion each.</p>
<p>Asia Pacific, driven by China and India, was expected to dominate the hydraulic industry, he said.</p>
<p>Growth prospects for Europe and North America were seen at a modest three percent per annum while Asia was seen growing at above five percent annually, he added.</p>
<p>Vickers would establish partnerships with customers and governments in the countries it worked in, Weber said.</p>
<p>It was also developing new product ranges and new technology for the hydraulic industry. Its regional expansion was reflected by its operations in India, China and Singapore, he said.</p>
<p>Vickers has two manufacturing plants in India and one in China.</p>
