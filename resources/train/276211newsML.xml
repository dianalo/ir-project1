<p>Storm clouds are gathering over Wall Street that may erupt into the steepest correction in years during 1997 as slower corporate earnings growth and greater market volatility encumber the ageing bull market.</p>
<p>While some analysts are calling for a downright bear market in the magnitude of 20 percent plus, most crystal ball gazers see a more shallow pullback and a return to the market's more historic growth rate of 8 percent to 10 percent.</p>
<p>Investors stampeded into stocks with a vengeance in 1996, with the Dow Jones industrial average surging 27 percent -- well beyond the 6 percent to 15 percent predicted by market strategists. The S&amp;P 500 index jumped 38 percent in 1995 and is up 22 percent so far this year.</p>
<p>Key factors that could cause problems in 1997 include a marked pickup in world economies that might spur higher interest rates and undermine stock prices, and slowing U.S. corporate earnings growth.</p>
<p>Strategists and economists estimate that the operating earnings of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies will grow only six percent in 1997, down from this year's seven percent to eight percent growth, according to First Call, a firm that tracks earnings forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is high and highly valued. You have to pick well -- it's not like the early and mid-80s. You also have to be sensitive on earnings,&quot; said Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney.</p>
<p>By a few historical measures, 1997 might point to a bear market.</p>
<p>Since 1950 the three years in which the market gained 30 percent or more -- 1954, 1958 and 1975 -- were followed by gains that were about half the previous year's, and then bear markets. As a double whammy, the years that have followed presidential re-elections also have proved to be bad for the market.</p>
<p>In any case, some analysts suggest that the six-year old bull run may be ripe for a setback of at least 10 percent.</p>
<p>A few analysts were reluctant to pinpoint targets for the 30-stock Dow index, mindful that it ran roughshod over 1995 and 1996 estimates.</p>
<p>Many noted that the staggering amount of money flowing into stock mutual funds --- at a rate of about $20 billion a month -- proved overwhelming to fundamental measures, and few see the flow withering in 1997 as long as interest rates and the economic climate remain favourable.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know why we can't sustain a relatively high level (of fund flow). The demographic forces (of ageing baby boomers) are pretty powerful. The key is if fundamentals disrupt it -- for example higher interest rates,&quot; Acuff said.</p>
<p>Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at UBS Securities, said volatility has characterised the month of December so far &quot;and in our view, volatility is here to stay.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., sees a correction for next year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market goes lower. Whether it's big enough for a bear market I don't know,&quot; said Metz, whose 1996 target of 4,860 for the Dow fell far short of the current 6,500 mark.</p>
<p>Money managers have miserably underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and have tried jumping on the bandwagon by recently snapping up &quot;safe&quot; large blue chips, such as International Business Machines Corp. and General Electric Co.</p>
<p>But few analysts expect that sort of investment strategy will play well in 1997 as earnings growth slows.</p>
<p>Technology stocks will hold their magnetic appeal as premier names continue to post double-digit earnings gains.</p>
<p>Some smaller-name companies will also be more alluring.</p>
<p>&quot;The big stocks will probably have things going against them,&quot; said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar works against them, valuations are more extended and portfolio managers are rotating to mid- and small-caps,&quot; said Cripps, who expects the Dow to range between 6,000 and 6,550.</p>
<p>Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co., said: &quot;Despite the somewhat muted feelings of 1997 being a good year, what with the first year of a re-elected president and poison pills delivered to the economy, I think monetary policy will be very favourable in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people are not expecting a lot of disappointment but there is a 'one foot toward the exit door' sense. Until that becomes 'no one is looking for an exit,' I'm not concerned.&quot;</p>
