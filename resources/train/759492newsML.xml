<headline>OHIS Macedonia, ICN in joint drug venture.</headline>
<dateline>BELGRADE 1997-07-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>OHIS of Macedonia and U.S. firm ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc signed an agreement in Belgrade over the weekend formally setting up a joint-venture drug company, ICN Macedonia.</p>
<p>&quot;We have signed an agreement to found a new subsidiary unit of the multi-national U.S. company ICN Pharmaceuticals of Costa Mesa,&quot; said ICN Yugoslavia Vice President Ljubisa Rakic, who signed the contract on behalf of the parent company.</p>
<p>The California-based company will have a 75 percent and Ohis a 25 percent stake in the highly automated Skopje factory which will employ 65 people.</p>
<p>Total investment in the new factory of $22 million will be mainly in equipment and knowhow provided by ICN while the Ohis chemical industry will provide the infrastructure.</p>
<p>&quot;The investment may appear small, but it is just the beginning. What is important is that ICN Macedonia is the first company in this area to begin operating on the principles of GMP which means its products will be exportable to all world markets,&quot; Rakic said.</p>
<p>A letter of intent was signed in Skopje last October by ICN Pharmaceuticals President Milan Panic and Ohis General Manager Jorgo Cuka.</p>
<p>The plant will initially manufacture 13 medicines, with around 60 percent of its output earmarked for export.</p>
<p>ICN Macedonia will also open a network of pharmacies to be equipped by ICN while Ohis will provide the premises. Four such pharmacies are planned in the first stage.</p>
<p>Annual sales are expected to be slightly over $14 million with net profit of around $4.2 million already in the first year of operation, Rakic said.</p>
<p>The plant, which is to begin production in October, plans to expand further into the fields of veterinary and dental medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;Analysing the Macedonian market we saw its drug needs were not covered by domestic production and that there was space here for us to expand and develop into pharmaceuticals,&quot; Cuka told Reuters.</p>
<p>Local producers cover just 18 percent of Macedonia's needs for medicines.</p>
<p>Ohis, which employs 3,920 people, has a total annual turnover of around 250 million German marks, Cuka said.</p>
