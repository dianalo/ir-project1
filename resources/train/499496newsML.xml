<title>COLOMBIA: Colombian shares end mostly higher, Bavaria falls.</title>
<headline>Colombian shares end mostly higher, Bavaria falls.</headline>

<p>Colombian stock indices closed slightly higher for the eighth consecutive trading session on Thursday, but brewer Bavaria ended an impressive winning streak by posting one of its first losses of the year.</p>
<p>Medellin's IBOMED general price index edged 0.21 percent higher to close at 17,185.86 on above-average trading volume of more than 10 billion pesos. Bogota's IBB ended up 0.64 percent, at 1,130.50 on volume of almost two billion pesos.</p>
<p>Bavaria, Colombia's hottest stock, has gained nearly 100 percent since late last year when it was trading at 4,800 pesos per share.  </p>
<p>Brokers said the stock fell victim to an inevitable bout of profit-taking on Thursday. Selling pressure was also prompted by denials of market rumors that Brazil's Companhia Cervejaria Brahma SA might buy a stake in Bavaria, they said.</p>
<p>Bavaria stock closed down 1.2 percent in Bogota at 8,200 pesos per share.</p>
<p>&quot;After such a strong run-up, it's only natural that people go out to take profits,&quot; one Medellin-based broker said. &quot;The move can undoubtedly be explained by the denial of reports about a possible buy into the brewer by Brahma,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Compania Suramericana de Seguros, Colombia's top insurer and flagship of the Sindicato Antioqueno conglomerate, was the day's biggest gainer by far. The stock closed up 7.19 percent at 25,030 pesos in Bogota amid a move by institutional investors to take up a long-term position in the company, dealers said.</p>
<p>Blue-chip Banco Ganadero's ordinary shares rose 2.43 percent to close at 358.5 in Medellin on what traders described as persistent rumors about its possible takeover of local savings and loan Concasa.</p>
