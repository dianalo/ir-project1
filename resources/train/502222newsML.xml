<p>The possibility of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko moving to South Africa after any handover of power has yet to be seriously studied, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It hasn't become a full-blown issue at the moment,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters. &quot;It may well, but until that happens nobody's applied their minds to it.&quot;</p>
<p>He was speaking after Deputy President Thabo Mbeki referred during a visit to Washington on Thursday to the possibility of Mobutu seeking asylum in South Africa.</p>
<p>South Africa hosted talks this week between representatives of Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose fighters have now taken control of about half of Zaire. Kabila on Wednesday gave Mobutu three days to surrender power.</p>
<p>The rapid advance of the rebels appears to have overtaken the peace talks in South Africa, which ended in agreement on the need for a ceasefire and for democratic elections.</p>
<p>The South African foreign ministry spokesman said the door was open for the Zairean rivals to return to South Africa for further talks if they wished.</p>
<p>&quot;The people that were here returned to brief their principals, but the internal situation there has changed dramatically so that will have an impact on how they come back to us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The door is always open, the offer still stands. It's a question of whether they want to pursue that,&quot; he said.</p>
