<p>Former international winger Ray Mordt has resigned as coach of South African provincial side Gauteng Lions, the club announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mordt has been replaced at the club, formerly known as Transvaal, by Koos Ehlers while former Transvaal centre Wim Hollander has taken over from Mordt's assistants, Hugo van As and Tito Lupini.</p>
<p>&quot;I am no longer prepared to deal with certain World Cup Springboks. They have created a negative environment which makes it impossible for me to continue coaching,&quot; Mordt told South African television news.</p>
<p>Mordt refused to single out any of the 10 Springboks in the Gauteng squad but there have been reports of differences between him and the province's captain Kobus Wiese and utility back Hennie le Roux.</p>
<p>Both players were surprise omissions from the Springbok squad to take on the British Lions and le Roux has recently been dropped from the provincial side and loaned out to Eastern Province.</p>
<p>After winning four trophies in the 1993 season under the captaincy of Francois Pienaar, Gauteng have won nothing since and Mordt's last game in charge resulted in a 20-14 defeat by the Lions last Wednesday.</p>
