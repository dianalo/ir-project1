<p>A Jewish settler leader said on Thursday he was ready for war, believing that Palestinians frustrated by the peace process could again take to the streets.</p>
<p>&quot;My job is to prepare for the worst,&quot; settler leader Pinchas Wallerstein said. He said even a month ago, before the unprecedented gunbattles between Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers, he was on a war-footing.</p>
<p>Wallerstein, head of the settler umbrella council YESHA, said he feared Palestinians who feel they came away empty-handed from this week's Washington summit could resume violence.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody in Tel Aviv can say 'great, Bibi won',&quot; he said, using Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's nickname. &quot;But I know that many Palestinians are disappointed...How many of my residents are they going to shoot at?&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat were called to Washington by President Bill Clinton in an attempt to end fighting in the West Bank and Gaza in which 58 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers were killed. The violence was sparked by Israel's opening a second entrance to a tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Arab Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Bleary-eyed from a constant alert since the fighting, Wallerstein, who leads the 130,000 armed settlers living among two million Palestinians, explained features of a ready room at Psagot settlement. It looks down on Palestinian-ruled Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, where Palestinian police fired at Israeli troops who shot at stone-throwers.</p>

<p>ISRAELI MILITARY CENSORS ORDERED DELETIONS FROM THIS REPORT</p>

<p>In the bunker, guarded by two soldiers, one wall was lined with a bank of phones and sophisticated communications equipment spewing static.</p>
<p>Against a second wall were three computer monitors: one to immediately display the location and ownership, anywhere in Israel or the territories, of settler cars if drivers pressed alarms; a second monitored schools and kindergartens; the third enabled Wallerstein to break into normal television broadcasts at settlements in the region in case of emergency.</p>
<p>He said the post was normally manned by one soldier. During the height of last week's fighting more than 15 were on duty.</p>
<p>&quot;We're afraid it could blow up again at any moment,&quot; Wallerstein, interrupted many times by phone calls from the army during a one-hour interview, said.</p>
<p>Above ground, armoured personnel carriers mounting heavy machineguns had taken up positions. Down the hill, tanks, the first deployed in the West Bank since Israel occupied it in 1967, ringed Ramallah.</p>
<p>Wallerstein and the men, women and children of Psagot had watched last week as Israeli troops and attack helicopters battled Palestinian police and stone-throwers.</p>
<p>&quot;It is humiliating more than frightening. They shoot at us and we practically cannot shoot back,&quot; Nahama, a 28-year-old woman said, seemingly oblivious to the Palestinian casualties.</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has said if Palestinians open fire again, they will not be fought, they will be crushed. The tanks are the message.</p>
<p>Psagot children were rooting for their side.</p>
<p>&quot;Not to close the tunnel and to keep fighting until they give in,&quot; Reuven, 13, said when asked what he thought Israel should do.</p>
<p>Wallerstein thinks Palestinians still dream of an independent state on the West bank, which settlers believe is theirs by God-given right.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, it is not clear to me whether the Palestinian dream of a Palestinian state whose capital is Jerusalem has ended. It has not ended. And as long as that is the dream there will be military confrontations.&quot;</p>
