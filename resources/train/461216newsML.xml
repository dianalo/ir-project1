<title>NETHERLANDS: NWE oil products mixed, fuel oil loses support.</title>
<headline>NWE oil products mixed, fuel oil loses support.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-03-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE oil products were steady to soft on Friday morning, fuel oil weakening as trader support disappeared, dealers said.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil barges were offered at $89 fob ARA, some $2 lower than on Thursday as the trading house that has propped up the market appeared to have concluded its buying blitz. Bids were around $86/$87.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were barely changed with the IPE screen stable and barely any interest in prompt physical trade. Offers began at around IPE April -$1.50 fob ARA, but few held out hope of deals at that level.</p>
