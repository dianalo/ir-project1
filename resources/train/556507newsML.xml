<headline>Pakistan names new navy chief after sacking.</headline>
<dateline>ISLAMABAD 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Pakistani government on Thursday named a new naval chief, Admiral Fasih Bokhari, for a three-year term to succeed Admiral Mansurul Haque who was sacked a week ago.</p>
<p>Bokhari, who was previously chief of staff at the naval headquarters with the rank of vice-admiral, has been promoted to admiral and appointed Chief of Naval Staff with &quot;immediate effect&quot;, a brief Defence Ministry announcement said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had sent Haque on forced retirement on April 24 amid newspaper reports suggesting the admiral was involved in corruption. Haque denies the charge.</p>
<p>It was the third sacking of a top commander of a branch of the armed forces in Pakistan's 50-year history.</p>
<p>Haque, who took charge of the navy in October 1994, had been the target of criticism in the Pakistani press in connection with a controversial purchase of three Agosta 90-B submarines from France in a contract signed the same year by the government of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.</p>
