<p>The outlook for Russian debt prices looks positive, especially the old Soviet commercial debt which is near to being restructured, ING Barings said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are generally bullish on Russia at current levels. This view is based on a positive assessment of political and economic risk,&quot; it said in a research comment.</p>
<p>A series of events, including the closing of the Vneshekonombank commercial debt deal and a Eurobond launch before the end of the year, will be positive for investor sentiment.</p>
<p>Set against this is the continued speculation over the health of President Boris Yeltsin and a potential succession crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;But, overall, we feel that the political system has matured to the point where such shocks can be handled within the framework of the constitution,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>It was least optimistic about the outlook for MinFins.</p>
<p>&quot;Tightening at the short end will be limited from current levels and..the long end will remain out of bounds for many foreign investors for some time to come.&quot;</p>
<p>When-and-if principal -- which the Vnesh debt will turn into once it is restructured -- looks attractive on pure risk-return grounds, though its high spread of around 1,200 basis points is partly due to uncertainty over custodial and accountancy procedures for the asset.</p>
<p>&quot;Our most favoured asset through year-end is unrestructred Vnesh, the idea being to capture the collapse of deal risk on closing and pick up a further expected tightening in spreads in the principle and IAN (interest arrears note) instruments,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors could combine this with a short position in the ...(when-and-if) instruments in proportion to the face value of principle loans to the attached PDI (past-due interest).</p>
