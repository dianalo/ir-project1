<headline>S.C. sergeant faces harassment charge court martial.</headline>
<dateline>COLUMBIA, S.C. 1997-05-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A military judge has set a June 11 trial date for Staff Sgt. Robert McLean, a drill sergeant at Fort Jackson who faces charges of sexual harassment of a trainee, a base spokeswoman said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Investigators said McLean, 34, was charged with exposing himself to a trainee and having &quot;conversations of a sexual nature&quot;. If found guilty, McLean could face up to six months in confinement, be demoted in rank and forfeit pay.</p>
<p>The charges stemmed from an incident that allegedly took place Easter Sunday. According to a report in The State newspaper in Columbia, women trainees charged that the drill sergeants showed a pornographic video to a group of women trainees in a barracks office and one of the sergeants allegedly tried to have sexual relations with a trainee after watching the video.</p>
<p>Fort Jackson is the Army's largest basic training base. More than 500 of the service's 2,000 drill sergeants are stationed there.</p>
<p>Last week, Army Staff Sgt. Delmar Simpson, 32, was convicted of 18 counts of rape of six trainees at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. He also was found guilty of 25 of 35 other sexual misconduct counts against him, not guilty of seven and guilty of lesser offences on three.</p>
<p>The drill sergeant could face life in prison for the rape convictions.</p>
