<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-05-07</dateline>

<p>Dutch bonds closed lower after a listless trading session on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tracking the bund future down in thin volume from the outset of trade, losses deepened in the afternoon when U.S. labour cost data over the first quarter were released.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw some people building up short-positions after the data,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>First quarter unit labour costs rose 2.7 percent against an expected 1.0 percent. Productivity was up less than market forecasts, gaining 2.0 percent.  </p>
<p>Dealers said a $12 billion auction in ten-year paper in the U.S. due later today had also pressured the Dutch bond prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at the yield curve, it's not very interesting. We have a feeling this auction won't do so well,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Trade on the Dutch market was quiet, with many players absent ahead of tommorrow's Ascension Day holiday.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was some activity in the ten-year segment, both in corporate and in government bonds.</p>
<p>The 5.75 percent ten-year benchmark closed nine basis points lower at 100.76/84, yielding 5.64 percent at bid.</p>
<p>Dealers also noted interest in the very short bonds.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the very short end now yielding above Germany, you see more people wanting to get into them,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The spread between 1998 Dutch bonds and bunds stood at zero at the end of trade. The Dutch benchmark yielded one basis points above its German counterpart at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>He said he expected five-year Dutch bonds to yield above German Bunds at the end of this year, foreseeing a return of interest in this segment as well.</p>
<p>&quot;On the very short term, I'm negative, but on the longer term, we believe the market looks good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment is not really bearish, we're just heading for a brief correction,&quot; another agreed.</p>
