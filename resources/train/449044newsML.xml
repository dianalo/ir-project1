<p>Nasdaq shares extended their slide Tuesday, with technology issues again leading the decline.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 10.04 points to unofficially close at 1269.39, - a similar percentage loss as the Dow Industrials.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's still under pressure,&quot; said a trader. &quot;It's not panic selling, they're not throwing things out the window. But when it's going to stop, I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>Dell Computer Corp fell 3-1/8 to 64-3/4 at the end of the day and Gateway 2000 Inc was down 2-1/2 to 50-1/8. Both Dell and Gateway were cut by Prudential Securities to holds from buy ratings this morning.</p>
<p>GoodMark Foods Inc lost 1-1/8, to close at 12-1/4. On Monday, GoodMark said earnings for fiscal 1997 would be &quot;well below&quot; 1996 earnings of $0.83 a share.</p>
<p>Biotechs were also weak. Biogen Inc was down two points to 40, while Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc tumbled 6-1/2 to 74. Centocor Inc closed down 1-3/8 at 30-5/8.</p>
<p>Losing issues beat winners 13 to eight. Total volume was 524 million shares.</p>
