<headline>Audiolux sets deadline for Audiofina swap.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1997-03-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Luxembourg holding company Audiolux SA said on Friday investors had until the end of April to say whether they would swap their interests for cash and shares in media holding company Audiofina.</p>
<p>&quot;Each shareholder will have one month from the publication of (this resolution) at the end of March to take their decision,&quot; the company said in a statement issued at an extraordinary general shareholders meeting.</p>
<p>Audiolux's main institutional shareholders said they would take up the offer, but the company appealed for small investors to stick with it while it diversified its portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;We have lots of interesting projects,&quot; Gaston Schwertzer, Chief Executive Officer of holding company Luxempart, Audiolux's biggest shareholder, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Luxempart, which presently holds 29.3 percent of Audiolux, told shareholders that together with Luxembourg insurance company  La Foyer (4.1 percent) it wanted to expand Audiolux's media interests beyond Audiofina.</p>
<p>Audiofina owns 50 percent of Europe's largest terrestrial television group, Luxembourg-based  CLT-UFA. The remaining 50 percent is owned by German media group Bertelsmann.</p>
<p>At the end of 1996, Audiolux held 5.1 percent of Audiofina and 98,787, or 0.5 percent of unlisted CLT shares.</p>
<p>Under the plan proposed on Friday, Audiolux's institutional shareholders will be sold the CLT shares for an independently determined price, while all shareholders will be offered 19 Audiofina shares plus 5,600 Luxembourg francs in cash for their Audiolux shares.</p>
<p>Audiolux said after the operation it would further cut its Audiofina holding in order to invest in other projects.</p>
<p>Luxempart and La Foyer will not take part in the operation, but officials said the other main shareholders would.</p>
<p>They are: Banque Generale du Luxembourg (14.7 percent), Banque Paribas Luxembourg (13.9 percent), state holding company  SNCI (12.2 percent), state bank  BCEE (12.0 percent) and newspaper  La Luxembourgeoise (2.9 percent).</p>
<p>Private investors owned around 10 percent of stock before the operation, Audiolux added.</p>
<p>One Audiolux official told Reuters new projects could include an application to run Luxembourg's second digital GSM phone network.</p>
<p>Luxempart, which will gain control of Audiolux following the operation, said it might also transfer some of its media interests to Audiolux.</p>
<p>However, Schwertzer told Reuters there was no decision yet about whether this might include Luxempart's 3.6 percent stake in unlisted Astra satellite operator  Societe Europeenne des Satellites.</p>
