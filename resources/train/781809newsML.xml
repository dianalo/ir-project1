<title>MALAYSIA: KL shares close up on rebound as locals support.</title>
<headline>KL shares close up on rebound as locals support.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-08-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysian shares closed higher on Wednesday after two days of heavy selling by foreign investors, as local institutions bought key index-linked stocks, said dealers and analysts.</p>
<p>The benchmark Composite index closed 6.66 points, 0.70 percent, higher at 951.74, after dipping to a new 1997 low of 936.12 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Some local funds are supporting, and there's some bargain hunting as well,&quot; said a dealer at a local bank-backed brokerage.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is some local buying, but it is on the small side. It looks as if the foreigners have completed their sales,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Key blue-chip stocks Sime Darby, Telekom and Tenaga were among the most actively-traded, all rising between five cents and 35 cents.</p>
<p>The stocks have a collective Composite Index weightage of around 25 percent.</p>
<p>Maybank continued to be sold down, falling 40 cents to 22.90 ringgit.  </p>
<p>&quot;My gut feeling is that whenever investors resort to selling Maybank, it's probably the last down leg of the market,&quot; said John Engle, managing director at ABN Amro Hoare Govett in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Newly-listed Autoindustries closed at 8.00 ringgit, unchanged from its debut price. It was offered at 2.90 ringgit.</p>
<p>Foreign institutions had sold down Malaysian shares since Monday after central Bank Negara imposed restrictions on foreign exchange swaps transactions. A 2.8 billion ringgit trade deficit for June 1997 gave added impetus to the sell-down.</p>
<p>Analysts said the technical outlook for the index remained weak.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of 10 brokerage houses and fund managers showed that the blue-chip index could dip to an average 907.2, with a firmer support level at 858.3.</p>
<p>The new resistance level for the index was seen at an average level of 1,000.8.</p>
<p>Speaking on Reuters Financial Television, Simon Key, chief investment oficer at Framlington INvestment Management, said he was &quot;underweight&quot; on Malaysia due to indications of overheating in the economy.</p>
<p>Market volume stood at 254 million shares, valued at 1.49 billion ringgit. Gainers outpaced losers 377 to 224.</p>
<p>On the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange, the spot August contract rose 23.5 points to 934.5, with 2,173 lots traded. September futures gained 21 points to 939.0 with five lots changing hands.</p>
