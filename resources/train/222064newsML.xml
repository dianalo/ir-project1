<p>Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel said in an interview published on Wednesday that the he was predicating monetary policy for 1997 on an inflation target of 8-10 percent, the same as 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The last target established by the previous government was for inflation of 8-10 percent. As long as this target is not updated, the Bank of Israel's working assumption is that this is the target that the government has authorised,&quot; Frenkel said in an interview with the newspaper Haaretz.</p>
<p>In the past the Treasury in coordination with the central bank had set an inflation target several months before the end of the year. Last year the previous finance minister, Avraham Shohat unilaterally set the target at 8-10 percent, but Finance Minister Dan Meridor has yet to determine a figure.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel has urged the Treasury to set more ambitious targets of 7-10 percent in 1997, falling gradually to 4-7 percent in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Although the rate has fallen sharply in the second half of the year, inflation in 1996 is expected to reach 11 percent, up from 8.1 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It is desirable that the government adapt as early as possible a strategy that sets multi-year targets for inflation in parallel with establishing targets for reducing the budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product through the year 2001,&quot; Frenkel said.</p>
<p>Frenkel said a multi-year target was important because the impact of monetary policy on the overall economy took as much as 6-9 months.</p>
