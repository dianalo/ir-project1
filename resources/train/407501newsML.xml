<headline>Turkey's Islamist PM says government harmonious.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said on Thursday the Islamist-led government, beset by tensions with the secular establishment, continued to work in harmony.</p>
<p>&quot;Thankfully our government is working harmoniously. The censure motions helped to strengthen our government further,&quot; he said after a regular meeting with President Suleyman Demirel.</p>
<p>The government this week survived a censure motion challenge from two leftist parties who said the coalition was a threat to the country's secularism.</p>
<p>Leading daily newspapers earlier reported Demirel had sent Erbakan a letter expressing concern that the government was at odds with the secular system. The president's office denied such a letter had been sent.</p>
<p>&quot;After the president's denial I hope that such unfounded stories will not be written again,&quot; Erbakan, who earlier described the press reports as &quot;a lie&quot;, told reporters after meeting Demirel.</p>
<p>He said the meeting with the president had dealt with public sector wages.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a widespread feeling that you are diverting from the secularist, democratic republican aims. This is also my belief,&quot; the mass-selling Hurriyet daily quoted Demirel as saying in the alleged letter.</p>
<p>The newspapers said the letter was also copied to armed forces leader Ismail Hakki Karadayi ahead of Friday's crucial meeting between top politicians and the restive chiefs of the secularist armed forces.</p>
<p>The armed forces have warned Erbakan's Islamist-right coalition in recent weeks against increasing the role of Islam in public life, and these issues are expected to be discussed at Friday's meeting of the National Security Council.</p>
<p>Demirel, himself dislodged as premier during two of three previous coups, allegedly warned Erbakan against the consequences of upsetting the army and other groups.</p>
