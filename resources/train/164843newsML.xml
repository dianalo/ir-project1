<title>SWITZERLAND: Airlines profits said hit by soaring fuel costs.</title>

<p>World airlines appear headed for their second year in a row of record profits but soaring fuel costs are slicing into their overall revenues, the head of the industry's global body IATA reported on Monday.</p>
<p>And IATA Director-General Pierre Jeanniot warned executives from over 250 member companies that a rush by carriers into hasty alliances to capture a bigger chunk of the booming market could bring more problems than successes.</p>
<p>&quot;This year should deliver another record profit....With interest charges slightly decreased, we would be looking at a net result of $5.5 billion,&quot; Jeanniot told the annual general meeting of IATA, the International Air Transport Association.</p>
<p>But that figure would be well down on the $6 billion he forecast in April this year before jet diesel price rises began seriously hitting the airlines, 11 per cent of whose costs are accounted for by fuel.</p>
<p>IATA airlines, who include highly profitable companies as well as chronic lossmakers, are fighting to fill the $15.6 billion hole left in their coffers by the recession of the early 1990s and the Gulf Crisis of 1990-91.</p>
<p>In 1994 and 1995, as passengers returned to the 98 per cent of all international routes covered by IATA companies, overall revenues began to climb and in 1995 reached $5.2 billion -- partly due to the industry surge in Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>In his speech prepared for delivery on Monday, Jeanniot said that last year's all-time record -- representing four per cent of total revenues of $128 billion -- was underpinned by a total traffic growth, passenger and cargo, of 8.2 per cent.</p>
<p>&quot;Airlines have downsized, outsourced, concentrated on core business....We could be reaching a point of diminishing returns in our ability to deliver further significant reductions in unit cost,&quot; the former Air Canada chief declared.</p>
<p>&quot;And their are various things that can divert us from our prifitable flight path, such as infrastructure charges, which are outside our control,&quot; he said, referring to mounting levies by airports and by governments for air traffic control services.</p>
<p>But Jeanniot signalled a key concern was fuel, for which airlines paid an average world-wide price last year of 65.2 U.S. cents a gallon but soared to 77.5 cents in September after the United States fired 27 Cruise missiles against Iraq.</p>
<p>Tension in the Gulf, source of much of the world's oil, generally sparks fuel price rises. At the weekend, a U.S. plane in the region fired another missile at an Iraqi target, but neither side appears to want to build up the incident.</p>
<p>Many European airlines have already announced they are putting up prices because of fuel costs, and IATA has called an emergency meeting in Geneva next week to discuss a concerted response by its members.</p>
