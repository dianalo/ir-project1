<p>Rebels taking over Zaire's capital set up their headquarters in Kinshasa's Chinese-built stadium and a young man with a famous surname -- Kabila -- was in charge.</p>
<p>Joseph Kabila commanded about 1,500 rebel troops inside the vast Kamanyola stadium on Saturday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>His father, Laurent Kabila, was expected in the capital within days to formally assume power as president of Africa's third biggest country and potentially one of its richest.</p>
<p>Kabila senior proclaimed himself president on Saturday from his base in Lubumbashi, nearly 1,600 km (1,000 miles) southeast of Kinshasa.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we met stiff resistance,&quot; Kabila junior told Reuters about a battle east of the city against departed president Mobutu Sese Seko's forces.</p>
<p>The resistance collapsed on Friday after Mobutu flew to safety in his northern village of Gbadolite and most of his key generals fled to neighbouring Congo.</p>
<p>Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire entered Kinshasa early on Saturday from three directions and controlled most of the huge city of five million people by nightfall.</p>
<p>Jubilant residents turned out to welcome them, waving freshly cut branches of trees and sporting white bandannas -- a widely recognised token of support for the rebels.</p>
<p>Residents reported isolated exchanges of gunfire in central areas and looting broke out in the wealthy suburbs.</p>
<p>Sporadic exchanges of automatic arms and mortar fire after nightfall suggested the rebels still needed to consolidate.</p>
<p>Areas under full rebel control were mostly calm during the afternoon and there was general satisfaction about the end of Mobutu's 32-year rule, which had been synonymous with corruption and decadence.</p>
<p>Rearguard rebel units straggled into the city as dusk fell.</p>
<p>Casualty figures were unknown. Four bodies, three of them military, lay outside the stadium.</p>
<p>Residents of Kinshasa's Lemba suburb said rebels killed two soldiers who resisted there. A nine-year-old boy was shot dead in an incident involving a rebel in the Kasavubu district in the heart of Kinshasa behind the parliament building.</p>
<p>Witnesses and diplomatic sources said hardline Mobutu loyalists seemed to be settling scores.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda was shot dead by a guard on Saturday morning as he tried to leave Kinshasa by boat for Congo.</p>
<p>Western embassies and Zairean sources had a lengthening list of dignitaries who may have been killed for suspected appeasement.</p>
<p>The first major casualty was defence minister and army chief of staff General Mahele Lieko Bokungo.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Mahele, killed in Kinshasa on Friday night by presidential guards, had been planning to meet Kabila to discuss handing over power.</p>
<p>Kabila and his rebels took up arms in October in a dispute over Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis.</p>
<p>Mobutu, 66 and stricken by cancer, has accused Tutsis from Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi of doing more of the fighting during the seven-month rebel campaign than indigenous Zaireans.</p>
<p>Tutsis are easily identifiable by their tall, rangy physique and their lack of mastery of French, one of Zaire's official languages.</p>
<p>The number of Tutsis among Alliance fighters in Kinshasa seemed lower than at the fall of other towns, said foreign journalists who have covered the civil war.</p>
