<headline>Search mounted for National Guard plane in Minn..</headline>
<dateline>DULUTH, Minn. 1997-01-08</dateline>

<p>Rescuers searched dense woods in northern Minnesota Wednesday for an Air National Guard fighter jet and its pilot that authorities believe crashed.</p>
<p>The F-16 disappeared while practicing &quot;night intercept&quot; manoeuvres with three other planes about 50 miles north of Duluth Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The crash was apparently not witnessed by anyone and the plane went down over a &quot;very deserted, densely wooded area,&quot; a spokesman for the 148th Fighter Wing of the National Guard said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are slowly eliminating the areas where the plane could have gone down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The plane did not have an automatic distress signal, but if the pilot had ejected that would have triggered a rescue beacon, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The pilot was not identified pending notification of his next of kin.</p>
