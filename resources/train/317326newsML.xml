<title>SOMALIA: Somalis urged to reopen Mogadishu port.</title>

<p>An Italian envoy has urged Somalian warlords to end their conflict and agree a formula to allow Mogadishu port, closed for the last 15 months, to reopen.</p>
<p>The Somali capital's port is lying idle because the rival factions disagree on running it, a spokesman for Ambassador Giuseppe Cassini, Italy's special envoy to Somalia, said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Cassini met warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed on Saturday, a day after a similar meeting with rival Hussein Mohamed Aideed. But the two were still bitterly opposed, Somali sources said.</p>
<p>Cassini told reporters his government welcomed the agreement reached by 26 Somali factions at a recent conference in neighbouring Ethiopia for a reconciliation of rival groups in the war-torn country.</p>
<p>He said he had discussed the agreement with both Aideed and Ali Mahdi. It now remained to be seen how it could be implemented. Aideed has already refused to support the Ethiopian agreement.</p>
<p>Cassini, however, expressed cautious optimism, and said Aideed had agreed to remove his faction's ban on the European Union's special envoy, Sigurd Illing. Aideed's faction declared Illing persona non grata last July after an acrimonious exchange with the EU.</p>
<p>Cassini said Illing would soon visit Mogadishu to meet Aideed.</p>
<p>Somalia has had no effective government since the overthrow of president Mohamed Siad Barre in January 1991, and is now divided with areas controlled by rival factions. The northern half of the country has broken away and declared itself the independent republic of Somaliland.</p>
