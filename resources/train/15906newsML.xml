<title>CANADA: Canada's Martin does not bite on tax cut bait.</title>

<p>Canada's Liberal Finance Minister Paul Martin refused on Tuesday to bite on the bait dangled by the Conservative Party of offering a tax cut.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, reduced in 1993 from a majority to only two seats in the 295-seat House of Commons, said on the weekend that it would push for a 10- to 20-percent income tax cut in its first term if elected.</p>
<p>Martin said the Conservatives, prior to Prime Minister Jean Chretien taking office, had raised taxes more than any other Canadian government. He said they had to state clearly what social programs would be cut to pay for tax reductions.  </p>
<p>He added that policies implemented by the Chretien government so far had already put money back in the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Take a look at what we've done. First of all, there's already been a substantial cut in unemployment insurance premiums, there have been major tariff cuts, which certainly puts money in Canadians' pockets,&quot; Martin told reporters after a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;And there is no doubt when you take a look at the reduction in the cost of a mortgage, for instance, as the result of interest rate cuts that have flowed from our deficit program, that has put more money in Canadians' hands than any tax cut that can be promised by any government.&quot;</p>
<p>Martin has guided the federal deficit down, targeting three percent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year and two percent in 1997-98.</p>
<p>Analysts have begun to wonder whether he might be tempted to pledge tax cuts ahead of elections expected in 1997, though any deviation from the sustained program of deficit cuts would risk ruining a track record the markets have so far applauded.</p>
