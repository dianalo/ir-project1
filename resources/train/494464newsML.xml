<p>Federal Express Corp. may consider offering discounts on services purchased through its site on the Internet's World Wide Web, an executive with the company said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Paul King, senior Federal Express marketing specialist, told the Internet Commerce Expo here that his company was shipping thousands of packages daily through the Web site and that it would soon begin using it to collect better market data on customers.</p>
<p>The site is at http://www.fedex.com.</p>
<p>King was asked if Federal Express might promote Internet transactions by offering discounts for online orders.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly been discussed. I would like to have that flexibility to stimulate useage of online applications. But at this point, we don't have firm plans to do that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Federal Express' goal would be to offer all of its services and features through the Internet, according to King. He declined to discuss when online operations would reach that point, but said he hoped it would be within the next three years.</p>
<p>King said much of the shipments carried out through the Federal Express Web site's &quot;ship&quot; application represented new business for the Memphis, Tenn.-based parcel delivery company.</p>
<p>&quot;Much of it's incremental. Its business we would not have gotten if we didn't have that application out there,&quot; he said, adding that new business wrung from the Internet presented a double benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;Each order we take for shipping costs us less and each new account we open costs us much less,&quot; King added.</p>
<p>The Federal Express Web site, which began in 1994, is now accessed more than 2 million times a month. It is also used to track more than 200,000 packages monthly, and over 150,000 copies of software have been downloaded through the site.</p>
