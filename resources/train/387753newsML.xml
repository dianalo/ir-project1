<headline>Salvadoran left tops right in pre-election poll.</headline>

<p>El Salvador's leftist opposition party of former guerrillas was leading the ruling right-wing party ahead of March elections, according to an opinion poll released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by the Central American University run by the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church, showed 21 percent of voters in favour of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), and 17 percent for the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA).</p>
<p>The poll, conducted on Feb. 1-9, asked 1,812 Salvadorans which party they intended to vote for on March 16, when a new Legislative Assembly and 262 mayors will be chosen. No margin of error was given.</p>
<p>It will be the first election since 1994, when the FMLN first ran as a legal political party and was soundly defeated by ARENA, led by President Armando Calderon Sol.</p>
<p>The FMLN and Calderon's predecessor, Alfredo Cristiani, also of ARENA, singed a peace accord in 1992 that ended 12 years of civil war that left an estimated 75,000 people dead.</p>
<p>In the the mayoral races, the poll showed the FMLN with a 21 percent lead followed by ARENA with 18 percent. The Christian Democrat Party, which governed before Cristiani won the 1989 election, was third with 4.6 percent in the congressional races and 5.3 in the mayoral races.</p>
<p>The poll also revealed that 22 percent of Salvadorans have not yet chosen a party, 16 percent said their vote was a secret and nearly 8 percent said they would not vote.</p>
