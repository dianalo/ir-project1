<p>NYCE cotton futures closed slightly higher after a rally in soybean futures sparked buying interest in cotton, market analysts said.</p>
<p>Local and trade buying lifted prices amid thin volume estimated at 7,000 lots compared to Wednesday's official 15,205 lots.</p>
<p>Most-active May settled up 0.33 at 74.25 cents per lb, having ranged from 74.57 to 73.95. The back months closed 0.05 to 0.55 cent firmer.</p>
<p>Resistance was pegged at 75.50 cents in May.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes said several fundamental factors provided underpinning to today's market.</p>
<p>Talk that planted area in China could fall by as much as 25 percent, coupled with worries that floods in the Southeast will cut U.S. area, supported new crop prices.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly export and sales report was mostly neutral for prices but may have prevented losses in the old crop, Ganes said.</p>
<p>While the USDA put new sales at only 79,800 480-lb bales for the week ended March 13, the number was higher than industry sources had anticipated. Shipments were strong at 194,000 bales.</p>
<p>Near-term pressure could come from certificated stocks, which rose to 200,192 bales as of March 19 from 199,568 bales the previous day, analysts said.</p>
<p>Open interest in May fell 521 lots to 30,541 lots.</p>
