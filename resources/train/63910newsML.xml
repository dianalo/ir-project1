<title>RUSSIA: Russia to clarify MinFin registration rules.</title>

<p>Russia will tighten procedures for registering MinFin bonds before it launches its first post-Soviet Eurobond later this year, a top finance ministry official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The authorities froze $24 million of missing and stolen MinFin bonds earlier this summer, and police say up to another $7 million of stolen bonds may be frozen.</p>
<p>The move undermined confidence in the market for MinFin bonds, which are dollar-denominated bearer securities, and which are traded heavily outside Russia.</p>
<p>But First Deputy Finance Minister Andrei Vavilov told a news conference the action reflected shortcomings in Russian law.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem appeared as Russian law has never dealt with such cases -- when securities are frozen and investors did not get enough protection,&quot; Vavilov said.</p>
<p>&quot;The major problem was that deals were not registered in the depository and we plan to increase the depository's obligations. We hope to do that before the Eurobond issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia will change procedures for working with frozen bonds, providing protection to investors who bought the securities in good faith, Vavilov said.</p>
<p>The bonds were frozen despite the statement in the Russian civil code which says bearer bonds may not be seized from people who bought them in good faith.</p>
<p>It is still not clear what will happen to the frozen bonds.</p>
<p>Earlier this month ING Bank Eurasia said the Russian authorities had unfrozen $51,000 of about $71,000 nominal of its bonds which had been frozen.</p>
<p>Vneshtorgbank is the main depository for MinFin bonds.</p>
<p>Vavilov added the Eurobond would be launched this year.</p>
<p>Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said last week that the Eurobond would be launched at the end of October, or start of November.</p>
