<p>British-based international business services group Rentokil Initial Plc is expected to announce a sharp jump in pre-tax profit and sales next week, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>However, the results will be flattered by comparison with the first-half of 1996, which included just two months of results from BET, the services group acquired by Rentokil last year after a lengthy struggle.</p>
<p>Analysts are expecting pre-tax profit of around 200 million stg compared with 134.5 million a year earlier, with the dividend payout rising to around 0.80 pence from 0.74 pence per share.</p>
<p>Sterling will have clipped the company's performance. In March, Rentokil warned that at rates then prevailing, the pound's strength could reduce full-year profits by around five percent.</p>
<p>After that warning, the pound rose by a further four percent against the mark between mid-March and the end of the second quarter and by five percent against the dollar.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg analyst Mike Murphy, who is predicting  half-year pre-tax profits of 201 million stg, said he expected sterling to have cut profits by around six percent in the first half.</p>
<p>Interest will also focus on the success of the integration of the two businesses. The company's goal in the past year has been to drive up profit margins in former BET businesses, whose presence is reflected in the use of the Initial brand name.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it is going extremely well, but we'd expect encouraging noises on the improvement at BET,&quot; said Murphy.</p>
<p>Although the results will no longer separate out the performance of BET and Rentokil, analysts hope they will show the old Rentokil operations are back on track, after stumbling in the second half of last year as management concentrated on the merger.</p>
<p>They said 1996 results relied heavily on BET to deliver Rentokil's 15-year-old promise, always fulfilled, of 20 percent gains in profits and sales every year.</p>
<p>&quot;The company said Rentokil had suffered because management attention had been distracted, but that should be a one-off phenomenon,&quot; said Williams de Broe analyst Peter Cartwright.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg's Murphy added, &quot;I think the evidence will be that the old Rentokil is back on track and growing profits at the historic rate.&quot;</p>
