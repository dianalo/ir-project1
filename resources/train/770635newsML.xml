<p>Ten people were killed when a tractor-trailer and a van carrying a high school band collided on Wednesday on a rain-slicked road in rural Washington County, police and school officials said.</p>
<p>The accident happened at an intersection near the town of Plymouth, in northeastern North Carolina about 100 miles (160 km) east of Raleigh, the highway patrol said.</p>
<p>The private van was carrying students involved with the Plymouth High School marching band, who were attending an annual summer marching band camp, a school official said.</p>
<p>The collision ripped the top off the van. All of those killed were students, ranging in age from 14 to 17, local media reported.</p>
<p>The driver of the tractor-trailer suffered minor injuries, according to media reports.</p>
<p>The accident happened about two miles from the high school and just over two weeks before the end of summer vacation. Classes at the school begin on Aug. 18, officials said.</p>
