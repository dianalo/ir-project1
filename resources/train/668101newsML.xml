<p>Australia's conservative government has widened its opinion poll lead over the Labor opposition, but its support still remains well below its election peak, a newspaper poll published on Tuesday found.</p>
<p>Support for Prime Minister John Howard's Liberal-National coalition increased one point to 44 percent over the past two weeks, boosting the government's lead over Labor to eight points from six, the Australian national daily's Newspoll found.</p>
<p>Labor's support fell one point to 36 percent.  </p>
<p>Far right populist Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party was steady at seven percent, down from its high of nine percent in early and mid-May but still well ahead of the traditional third political bloc, the Australian Democrats.</p>
<p>Democrat support dropped to three percent from five.</p>
<p>The Australian's latest measure of primary support compares with the government's peak primary vote of 47.3 percent and Labor's 38.8 percent in the March, 1996, election, that saw Howard sweep into office and end 13 years of Labor rule.</p>
<p>The Democrats won 6.8 percent of the primary vote in that election.  </p>
<p>Howard has also widened his gap over opposition leader Kim Beazley as preferred prime minister.</p>
<p>Howard's rating increased two points to 47 percent, as Beazley's fell one point to 25 percent. But 28 percent of those surveyed were uncommitted.</p>
<p>The poll surveyed 1,152 voters around the country by telephone over the weekend of June 14-15.</p>
