<title>CHINA: Beijing intensifies crackdown on corruption.</title>

<p>Beijing arrested more than 400 people and indicted almost 800 on corruption charges last year in a crackdown after the downfall of the capital's Communist Party boss.</p>
<p>&quot;These cases show the success of Beijing's battle against corruption,&quot; the official China Daily on Saturday quoted Ma Jianguang, vice procurator general of the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Procuratorate, as saying.</p>
<p>The arrests and indictments also showed &quot;the enhanced awareness of the law among the people, who actively provide valuable clues for solving the cases&quot;, Ma said.</p>
<p>Beijing authorities accepted and heard 1,702 cases of graft, embezzlement and bribery in 1996, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors filed charges against suspects in 836 of the cases and recovered 285 million yuan ($34.3 million) in ill-gotten wealth, Ma said.</p>
<p>Forty-four officials above the rank of section chief were convicted or remained under investigation, he said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also indicted 775 people and approved the arrests of 430 suspects, the daily said. Twenty-eight of the cases involved more than one million yuan ($120,000) each.</p>
<p>Corruption, virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, has returned in the last two decades in the wake of economic reforms.</p>
<p>Scandal first surfaced among Beijing's rulers in April 1995 when Vice Mayor Wang Baosen committed suicide after coming under investigation for corruption and embezzling up to $37 million.</p>
<p>Wang's mentor, Beijing Communist Party boss Chen Xitong, was forced to resign shortly afterwards and was ousted from the party's powerful Politburo in September 1995.</p>
<p>Another Beijing vice mayor, Zhang Baifa, said last month that Chen could be punished for dereliction of duty, a further disgrace for an official who was once among China's most influential men.</p>
<p>But Zhang hinted Chen was unlikely to face criminal charges since investigations into the man who presided over China's capital for most of the 1980s had uncovered no evidence of more serious wrongdoing.</p>
