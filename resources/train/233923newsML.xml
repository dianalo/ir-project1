<p>Dismissed Mexican Attorney General Antonio Lozano is the latest victim of a pair of murder cases so mind-boggling they confound all those who touch them.</p>
<p>The murders, both in 1994, of top ruling party politicians Luis Donaldo Colosio and Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu have seen three attorney generals and three special investigators between them, and have gripped the attention of Mexicans more than any of the soap operas on the nation's TV screens.</p>
<p>&quot;The tragic has become the banal,&quot; leftist intellectual and columnist Carlos Monsivais told Reuters. &quot;There is no TV soap opera that can compare with the Colosio and Ruiz Massieu murders.&quot;</p>
<p>More than two years later, neither of the cases is really solved.</p>
<p>One man seized at the scene of the March 1994 Colosio killing is serving a 45-year sentence for shooting him in the head. Prosecutors insist a plot lay behind the killing, but have repeatedly failed to prove it.</p>
<p>Just for good measure, a private detective has produced what he claims is proof that the man convicted is in fact a double switched for the real assassin.</p>
<p>In the second case, Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder brother of Mexico's former president Carlos Salinas, has been in jail for more than 18 months awaiting a verdict on charges of masterminding the September 1994 Ruiz Massieu killing, but the evidence against him is also widely seen as weak.</p>
<p>&quot;These are two very radioactive dead men,&quot; Monsivais said. &quot;People watch attorney generals and prosecutors come and go in these cases like characters on television.&quot;</p>
<p>Political commentator Federico Reyes Heroles agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;The official responses, nearly three years on, are insufficient to resolve the intriguing plot of the Mexican comedy: Whodunnit and Why?,&quot; he wrote in Reforma newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;Since March 1994, millions of man-hours have been spent on speculation, often based on bad information and ignorance of the law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians, and most Mexicans according to polls believe Carlos Salinas had something to do with the Colosio killing, a charge he denies.</p>
<p>The first special prosecutor in the case, Miguel Montes, said the investigations are now utterly fouled up.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they are totally perverted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Montes should know. He initially decided the killing was a plot and then flip-flopped to say the only man in jail for the killing had acted alone. Successive prosecutors have see-sawed between the two views.</p>
<p>&quot;The result doesn't matter that much now because nobody will believe it anyway,&quot; Monsivais said.</p>
<p>A breakthrough appeared to come in the Ruiz Massieu case two months ago when Lozano and his top detective had a skeleton dug up at a ranch used by Raul Salinas.</p>
<p>They appeared confident it was the body of Manuel Munoz Rocha, a ruling party congressman accused of helping mastermind the killing and missing for more than two years.</p>
<p>They might have known trouble was brewing: a key witness who police said helped them find the skeleton was a lady known as Paca, a witch or soothsayer once employed by Raul Salinas.</p>
<p>The skeleton -- quickly dubbed Cuajimalpa Man after the name of the Mexico City suburb where it was dug up -- also had some curious features, including a surgical incision on the skull which suggested it had already undergone an autopsy before being buried, and several more inches in height than Munoz had when he was alive.</p>
<p>Officially no one is saying, but leaks to newspapers this week said the bones do not belong to Munoz -- and that appears to have been enough to cost Lozano his job.</p>
<p>Join us next week for another exciting episode.</p>
