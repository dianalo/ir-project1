<p>Five Irish soccer fans hurt in rioting at a &quot;friendly match&quot; between Ireland and England match settled compensation claims on Tuesday against the national footballing authorities, the Irish state and police.</p>
<p>They had each claimed 30,000 pounds ($48,000) in a civil court action but agreed to settle out of court. The Dublin court declined to reveal how much they received.</p>
<p>The fans said they had been allocated seats among English supporters at the game in Dublin two years ago.</p>
<p>Several people were injured in the rioting, the worst crowd violence at any Irish sporting fixture, and the game was abandoned.</p>
<p>The fans claimed the Football Associations of England and Ireland and the police were responsible for the injuries they received after Ireland scored and English fans in the upper level of the stands ripped up wooden seats and hurled them into the crowd below.</p>
<p>The defendants denied responsibility.</p>
<p>Right-wing extremists were blamed for orchestrating the violence. It later emerged that Britain's National Criminal Intelligence Service had warned Irish authorities about potential trouble.</p>
<p>A lawyer for the five said that they were delighted with the settlements. ($1=.6227 Pound)</p>
