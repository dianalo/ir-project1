<headline>Brazil's left wing slams plan to sell CVRD.</headline>
<dateline>BRASILIA 1997-04-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazil's left-wing political parties on Wednesday strongly criticized the upcoming privatization of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) and said they were close to calling a congressional probe into the mining conglomerate's sale.</p>
<p>&quot;The model for the privatization of CVRD is under suspicion, and we need to hold a parliamentary commission of inquiry (CPI) to investigate,&quot; Deputy Jose Machado of the Workers Party said at an emotionally charged public hearing held in Congress.  </p>
<p>Deputy Miro Texeira of Democratic Labor Party told the newswire Invest News that a petition calling for a parliamentary commission to investigate the CVRD privatization was just one signature short of the number required.</p>
<p>Senator Jose Eduardo Dutra, who is in charge of mustering signatures for the petition, earlier told Reuters the list was not complete but declined to give further details.  </p>
<p>A congressional investigation could delay by months the government's plan to begin privatizating CVRD on April 29, when it is due to sell a block of 40 to 45 percent of the company's voting shares.</p>
<p>The privatization, which will also involve the sale of shares to CVRD employees and international investors, is set to become Latin America's largest, with revenues expected to total about $6.0 billion.  </p>
<p>Left-wing lawmakers have accused U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc of failing to declare what they consider to be a conflict of interest when the bank was appointed as an official consultant to the CVRD privatization.</p>
<p>The lawmakers say Merril Lynch's ownership of the South African brokerage Smith Borkham Hare represents a conflict of interest because that firm acts as sponsoring broker in Johannesburg to South Africa's Anglo American Corp, which is expected to bid in the April 29 auction for CVRD.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch has denied the allegations.</p>
<p>Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros, the president of the National Development Bank (BNDES), which is in charge of Brazil's privatization program, also denied there had been any irregularity.</p>
<p>At the public hearing on Wednesday, he said Merrill Lynch bought the South African firm before the BNDES opened the bidding for the CVRD consultancy contract.</p>
<p>&quot;People are trying to make a drama out of this,&quot; Mendonca de Barros said.</p>
