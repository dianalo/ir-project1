<p>Sentiment against Indonesia's ruling Golkar party has intensified in the central Javan Yogyakarta city after an attack this week on a rival's office, minority party officials and residents said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP), one of only three parties allowed to contest the country's May 29 general elections, halted its campaign in the city after a group of people, who PPP officials said were Golkar supporters, ransacked the party's headquarters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It was Golkar's turn to campaign in Yogyakarta on Saturday and this went ahead amid tight security. Armed troops were stationed in several parts of the low-rise city, especially in the districts considered as PPP strongholds.</p>
<p>However, no incidents have been reported so far.</p>
<p>Golkar banners and those from the other minority party, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), could be seen throughout the city, capital of the special administrative region of more than three million people.</p>
<p>The three legal parties, the PPP, the Golkar and the PDI, have agreed to campaign on different days in different parts of the country to avoid violence. But disturbances marred campaigning last week.</p>
<p>PPP banners, flags and posters had all been removed by party officials following the attack on its headquarters. In their place, anti-Golkar graffiti was scrawled on walls in black spray paint.</p>
<p>Yogyakarta, a major tourism centre, is one of several towns in Central Java to be hit by political violence between the PPP and Golkar supporters in the run up to the election.</p>
<p>&quot;The city is actually tense, even though things seem to go on quite well. I think disturbances may erupt anytime,&quot; Suwandi Subroto, a deputy secretary of the PPP's Yogyakarta branch, said.</p>
<p>Subroto said party officials would meet on Monday to decide whether to continue the campaign which will last through May 23.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are doing now is cooling down. There's no use in continuing to hold the campaign when (our) people are burning with emotion,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The day after the attack, PPP supporters expressed anti-Golkar sentiment in strongly-worded posters, some in Javanese, and garlands along the street in the Kuncen area, a PPP stronghold.</p>
<p>There were also coffins, a mock graveyard and a mock corpse.</p>
<p>&quot;All this stuff is part of our protest against Golkar,&quot; said one resident living in the area.</p>
<p>The ransacked PPP offices also drew the attention of protesters and had anti-Golkar posters pasted on the headquarters' walls.</p>
<p>PPP chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum told reporters in Jakarta on Friday he regretted the incident in Yogyakarta and said cancelling the campaign was the best thing to do.</p>
<p>Golkar, in power for the past 30 years under President Suharto, is seeking to push its share of the vote over 70 percent from the 68 percent it won in the last polls in 1992.</p>
<p>The PPP won 17 percent and the PDI 15.</p>
<p>The three parties are vying for the support of nearly 125 million voters to fill 425 elected seats in the 500-seat House of Representatives in the world's fourth most populous nation. The other 75 seats are alloted to the military which does not vote.</p>
<p>Bambang Sunaryo, a Golkar Yogyakarta official, said the party was investigating whether its supporters were behind the attack on the PPP's headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are facing an accusation by PPP...but we will investigate if those people are behind the attack and if it is true that they are behind it, we will find out why they did it at the first place,&quot; he said.</p>
