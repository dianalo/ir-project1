<p>Lebanon's central bank said on Tuesday its regulation requiring brokerage licenses for foreign and local firms would create a platform for a mutual fund industry.</p>
<p>&quot;This opens up the potential for a new industry to emerge in Lebanon relating to fund management and the mutual fund industry,&quot; Bank of Lebanon first vice governor Nasser Saidi told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The brokers and dealers are allowed to undertake portfolio management activities and therefore what can emerge is the beginning of an industry that could manage mutual funds in Lebanon and the Arab world,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said the central bank had recently approved licenses for Merrill Lynch, Swiss bank Banque SCS Alliance-Geneve and Lebanese firm Glendale Asset Management.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch had already been operating in Lebanon as a commercial firm but did not have a central bank brokerage license, Saidi added.</p>
<p>The central bank is currently reviewing three other brokerage applications which include joint ventures between foreign companies and local firms, said Saidi without elaborating.</p>
<p>The new licenses are part of a central bank regulation requiring all brokerage houses to obtain Bank of Lebanon approval to operate in Lebanon, once a regional banking and financial centre.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim is to protect consumers and investors. Some investors have lost money in the past. Now companies will be supervised,&quot; Saidi said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look across the emerging markets, this is a way for foreign investors to come into these markets in terms of mutual funds,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Beirut's Allied Business Bank this month said it expected to launch Lebanon's first mutual fund soon and was planning two other funds, all worth a total of $7 million.</p>
<p>The fund, which targets Lebanese investors but is open to foreigners, will be the first in Lebanon based solely on Lebanese equities and bills.</p>
<p>Saidi said the central bank regulation would benefit Allied Business Bank and any other companies who were interested in the mutual fund business.</p>
<p>The official Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE), which reopened last year after a 13-year closure in the civil war, trades 10 shares of eight companies and is capitalised at $2.92 billion.</p>
<p>Lebanon's over-the-counter (OTC) market is capitalised at more than $780 million.</p>
<p>Brokers said the central bank regulation launched in June 1996 would help foster more transparency in the market but stressed that greater investment opportunities were needed for the market to flourish.</p>
<p>&quot;Lebanon needs more vehicles for investment,&quot; said Michel Aramouni, head of treasury and capital markets at Beirut's Banque Audi.</p>
