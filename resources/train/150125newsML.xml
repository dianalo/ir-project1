<headline>Polish coalition's tax decision seen next week.</headline>

<p>Poland's ruling leftist coalition is likely to decide next week what tax levels it will back in the Senate after the lower house defeated the government's tax proposals, a coalition official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;After the (All Saints Day) holiday break, there will be a coalition meeting which will decide on the way the tax issue will be handled,&quot; Andrzej Urbanczyk, the spokesman of the coalition's Social Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) told Reuters.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said on Monday he would seek to persuade the Senate to return to the government proposal to cut personal income taxes to 20, 31 and 43 percent from the present 21, 33 and 45 percent.</p>
<p>Last week in a surprise upset for the government the lower house passsed a tax bill introducing a new lower 17 percent tax band for the lowest paid, which the finance ministry estimated would cost the budget 4.6 billion zlotys in lost revenues.</p>
<p>The Sejm also voted to cut corporate income tax by two points to 38 percent next year, a proposal which the SLD still supports.</p>
<p>Urbanczyk said the coalition of the SLD and its junior partner the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), was likely to start its tax discussions on November 4, and the tax proposals were likely to be voted at the Senate's session on November 14-15.</p>
<p>Once the coalition agrees on a common line the parliamentary votes should be a mere formality as the two co-ruling parties enjoy a comfortable majority in both chambers of parliament.</p>
<p>The Peasants, who helped defeat the government bill, later suggested they might agree to block the bill in the Senate if they are convinced the plan to slash taxes for the lowest paid could not be accommodated by the nearly-complete 1997 budget.</p>
<p>Poland is due to hold parliamentary elections next year.</p>
<p>The government, bound by an October 31 deadline, should submit later on Tuesday a budget draft based on this year's tax levels with a deficit of 11.3 billion zlotys or 2.6 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>But Kolodko has signalled that the government would amend the budget if the Senate rejects the lower house's tax bill and supports the government's proposals.</p>
<p>The amended budget would maintain in general the presently proposed spending levels but would assume lower tax revenues and consequently a wider than initially planned deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The lower house will have three months to pass the budget and the Senate additional 20 days to approve it or introduce changes.</p>
<p>The tax bill, if amended by the Senate, will have to be approved by the lower house and then signed by the president by the end of November to come into force.</p>
<p>If the tax bills fail to become law at least a month before the start of the next fiscal year, the old taxes will remain in force. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700</p>
