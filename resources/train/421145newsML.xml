<headline>U.S., South Korea in talks with Pyongyang.</headline>

<p>The United States and South Korea, meeting North Korea for the first time on ending the Korean peninsula's technical state of war, presented proposals on Wednesday for international talks on a peace agreement.</p>
<p>A U.S. official who asked not to be identified said during a break in the talks at Manhattan's Hilton Hotel that none of the three delegations &quot;want to offer any characterisation in mid-stream&quot; of the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;But we and the South Koreans spent the morning putting forward part of our presentation and there's still some left,&quot; the official said. &quot;The morning session was mostly devoted to our presentation.&quot;</p>
<p>Witnesses said the meeting began with members of the delegations shaking hands and exchanging small talk, either in Korean or through interpreters. The three heads of delegation clasped their hands together, one on top of the other, before sitting down at a circular table in a hotel conference room.</p>
<p>It was the first time officials from Pyongyang and Seoul had met to discuss armistice issues although representatives have met on other topics, most notably an international agreement to freeze North Korea's nuclear programme.</p>
<p>The meeting came during a period of high tension between bitter rivals North and South Korea, including a string of defections from the North and reports of famine and economic collapse in the Stalinist state long allied with China and the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The talks stemmed from last April's proposal to North Korea by President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam for four-way talks, including China, to work out a peace agreement to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>The meeting, described by the U.S. State Department as a &quot;joint briefing,&quot; was convened at the request of Pyongyang, which wanted more information on U.S. and South Korean proposals for such talks. Actual negotiations may not start until July or so, a senior U.S. official said on Monday.</p>
<p>North Korea has twice delayed taking part in the New York briefing in what was seen as an effort to press Washington to provide more food aid. Pyongyang had demanded that the armistice be scrapped to pave the way for a peace treaty with Washington alone -- a demand that is unacceptable to South Korea and to the United States, which fought at its side during the war, while China supported North Korea.</p>
<p>A reporter allowed into the room for a brief photo opportunity said the South Korean delegation head, Deputy Minister for Political Affairs Song Young Shik, told North Korean counterpart Kim Gye Gwan &quot;this is a significant event,&quot; to which Kim apparently indicated agreement. Kim is vice minister for foreign affairs.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation is headed by Charles Kartman, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.</p>
<p>Delegation members, all dressed in dark business suits, were seated at circular tables. The briefing could last all day, depending on how the North Koreans respond to the U.S. and South Korean proposals, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official privy to the discussions said on Monday the shape of the table was a &quot;big deal&quot; that was negotiated, along with some related issues, over the course of several days.</p>
<p>Difficult negotiations on table shape and seating arrangements also accompanied such momentous negotiations as the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam War and the 1991 Madrid peace conference that launched direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.</p>
