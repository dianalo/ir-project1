<title>BOSNIA: Dole says Congress looking for results in Bosnia.</title>
<headline>Dole says Congress looking for results in Bosnia.</headline>

<p>Former U.S. senator Bob Dole said on Monday Washington legislators wanted to see political progress as a result of expensive peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia.</p>
<p>Dole, who lost to Bill Clinton in last year's presidential election, said the U.S. Congress may reconsider its support for reconstruction aid and peacekeeping troops in Bosnia if political leaders failed to abide by a peace treaty.</p>
<p>The United States, which has deployed some 8,000 peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, had spent some $6 billion dollars so far trying to help shore up the country's fragile peace, Dole said.</p>
<p>Continued support from the Congress &quot;is going to depend on what they see&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they see politicization of the military, or the prominence of Islamic extremists in government or Serbs and Croats decreasing in number in government jobs, that would be unfortunate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bosnian Moslem leaders viewed Dole as an ally during the 1992-95 war because of his calls for NATO air strikes and for an end to an international arms embargo which crippled the Bosnian government army.</p>
<p>Dole, who met Bosnian Moslem officials and representatives from opposition parties, urged the restoration of the country's multi-cultural character.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Sarajevo must be the model for the new Bosnia, resurrected out of the ashes of war,&quot; Dole told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be a place where people of all religions and ethnicities are welcome and are citizens with full rights.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarajevo is now a predominantly Moslem city due to the upheaval caused by the war and a brutal Serb siege.</p>
<p>Most Serbs fled the city when Serb-held suburbs were handed over to the Moslem-Croat federation as part of the peace settlement. Tens of thousands of Moslem refugees expelled by conquering Serb forces elsewhere have moved into the suburbs.</p>
<p>Although the U.S.-brokered peace agreement was &quot;not perfect&quot;, it provided a framework for building a lasting peace, Dole said.</p>
<p>He praised the Clinton administration for linking peacetime aid to compliance with the peace agreement and said U.S. taxpayers would only pay for projects which promoted religious or ethnic co-existence.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't need apartheid in Bosnia,&quot; he said.</p>
