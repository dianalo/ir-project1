<p>Airline owner Richard Branson said on Tuesday that he had written to a European Union offical over what he called unfair action by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and would make a formal complaint if neccessary.</p>
<p>Speaking at an airport news conference to launch his Virgin Express airline's Brussels-Copenhagen service he said he had written to European Commision air transport chief Fredrik Sorensen complaining about SAS price cuts on selected Copenhagen-Brussels flights.</p>
<p>&quot;If SAS can afford to reduce their fares suddenly and miraculously...on a particular flight which happens to go quite near the time of our own flight, but not be able to do it on all their other flights, that is the sort of behaviour that we feel is blatantly anti-competitive and we're asking Fredrik Sorensen to look into it,&quot; Branson said.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that it's such a blatantly stupid thing (for SAS) to do that one letter from him hopefully will sort it out, but if not we'll make a formal complaint.&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Virgin started daily flights between Copenhagen and Brussels last Friday at up to 75 percent less than competitors' fares.</p>
<p>SAS earlier said Branson, whose Virgin Atlantic airline broke ground 13 years ago in challenging the transatlantic dominance of major carriers, was trying to stop the Scandinavian firm competing with Brussels-based Virgin Express.</p>
<p>&quot;They are an airline which wants competition and then when they get it, they complain about it,&quot; Hans Ollongren, SAS director of European affairs, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Branson said his low cost, no-frills short-haul flights were not neccessarily a threat to SAS and, by bringing to Copenhagen passengers who might not otherwise travel, might actually bring the Scandinavian carrier new long-haul customers.</p>
<p>&quot;By charging these fares we expect to have maybe three times as many people flying as fly today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;By more people being able to afford to fly short haul, more people will be able to fly long-haul. If SAS has long-haul flights from here and we bring people in cheaply from other cities they also maybe could sell a ticket on with SAS abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;We needn't take market share from them, well we needn't take much market share from them, and I think there's going to be an awful lot of new business generated.&quot;</p>
<p>Virgin Express, launched in April after Branson took over EuroBelgian Airlines SA (EBA), operates 14 Boeing 737 aircraft and expects to double that number by the year 2,000.</p>
<p>It takes delivery of two new Boeing 737-400s early next year, but these will replace existing aircraft. Chief Executive Jonathan Ornstein said he was talking to several manufacturers.</p>
<p>&quot;Relying on one manufacturer can lead to higher prices so we're talking to Boeing and we're talking to McDonnel Douglas and we're talking to Airbus about possibly a fleet replacement,&quot; he said.</p>
