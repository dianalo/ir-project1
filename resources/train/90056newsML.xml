<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Coda Music cut to hold.</headline>
<text>
<p>--John G. Kinnard &amp; Co said Wednesday it cut its rating for Coda Music Technology Inc to hold from buy, due to disappointing sales in some of its music education software in the third quarter.</p>
<p>--The company said third quarter sales of its Vivace Intelligent Accompaniment product were about $500,000 in the quarter, compared to $328,000 a year ago. Overall sales were $1.2 million, down from $1.4 million a year ago, Coda had said.</p>
<p>--&quot;Relative to expectations, it was kind of a disappointment,&quot; Kinnard analyst Clinton Morrison said in a telephone interview. He noted that third quarter is usually the key selling time for educational products.</p>
<p>--&quot;There's a chance that they may be making a pickup in the December quarter, but they may have missed the proverbial season,&quot; Morrison said.</p>
<p>--Coda's stock fell 15/16 to 3 on Nasdaq Wednesday.</p>
