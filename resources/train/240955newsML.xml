<headline>French stocks slip further on Jochimsen comment.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>French shares fell further and risked falling through the 2,200 level after comments by Bundesbank member Jochimsen said that there was no need for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth.</p>
<p>He also said that the German economy was not yet strong enough for self-sustained growth.</p>
<p>The comments came when Paris was already down by over three percent due to remarks by another central banker, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alain Greenspan, warning markets about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; which was taken as a big selling sign.</p>
<p>U.S. payroll data due at 1330 GMT seen as key.  </p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 89.89 points or 3.92 percent at 2,202.61 at 1149 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,204 from 2,294 on Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was close to four billion francs.</p>
<p>A stocks analyst at Paribas said the U.S. data would be decisive for the rest of the day and next week.</p>
<p>&quot;If the figures are just bad (job creation of 200/220,000 ex-farm) the market will be flat to weaker and remain on its toes due to Greenspan,&quot; the analyst said. &quot;If they are good (about 170,000 jobs created) the market could flatten out. But if they are very bad the correction can continue,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Paribas keeps its end of year target at 2,200.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected Wall Street could fall by as much as 100 points. Analysts said that the Paris market, which had been trading near its life high recently, could fall another two to three percent over the coming days.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greenspan comments were an excuse to take profits,&quot; said Gary Dugan, French equity analyst at JP Morgan in London.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is nothing in his comments that point to higher rates there and the situation in Germany is panning out in a way that we expect a rate cut there within the next three months, which is good for equities.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;In Paris we had been trading some seven to eight percent above the 90-day moving average and we were expecting a correction. I think we can still go down another two to three percent,&quot; he said.</p>
