<p>Shares in banking group Lloyds TSB Group Plc hit the latest of a series of record highs on Monday amid positive press and analyst comment following results on Friday.</p>
<p>Lloyds shares were up 8-1/2p at 744-1/2 by 0954 GMT, after earlier reaching a record 756p -- surpassing its previous peak of 745p on August 1. At today's high, the stock was 75 percent above its level at the end of 1996.  </p>
<p>SocGen and BZW were among brokerages which set a price target of 900p on Lloyds shares, after the company on Friday posted a 33 percent rise in pre-tax profit to 1.504 billion stg and said it was planning an acquistion or share buyback.</p>
<p>The Financial Times Lex column said it was possible to come up with a price of more than 900p using discounted cash flow calculations because of Lloyds' strong cash generation and competitive cost base.</p>
<p>Lex added that Lloyd's strong retail position offered protection from margin pressure.</p>
<p>BZW repeated a &quot;buy&quot; rating on the stock and raised its 1997 pre-tax profit estimate to 3.19 billion stg from 3.17 billion. Analysts at the brokerage were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>However, Goldman Sachs issued one of the few cautious comments, repeating a &quot;market underperformer&quot; rating even as it raised its pre-tax estimate by five percent to 3.2 billion stg and its 1998 estimate by ten percent to 3.8 billion.</p>
<p>Goldman analysts also could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
