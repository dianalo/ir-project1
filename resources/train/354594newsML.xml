<p>European Union member states, already dragging their feet over enforcing existing measures, meet on Wednesday to discuss new ways of fighting organised crime spanning drugs and sex, money laundering and stolen cars.</p>
<p>At a two-day informal meeting in the Dutch seaside town of Noordwijk, EU interior and justice ministers -- who between them have hardly ratified a single crime-fighting convention -- will discuss even deeper cooperation in the fight against cross- border crime.</p>
<p>Justice Commissioner Anita Gradin will tell them bluntly they should start by ratifying the existing EU conventions.</p>
<p>&quot;She will point out that all the conventions that the member states have signed up to...now have to be rapidly ratified by the national parliaments to strengthen the fight against organised crime,&quot; a Commission official said.</p>
<p>The conventions cover customs cooperation, protection of the community's financial interests, extradition and setting up the EU's police agency Europol.</p>
<p>The new talks will focus on finding a legal framework for fighting crime and practical cooperation between investigators, police and prosecutors across the Union, EU officials said.</p>
<p>The talks will also focus on the structure of organised crime, funding crime-fighting activities and fighting money laundering.</p>
<p>The ministers will also discuss how EU cooperation in justice, home affairs and immigration policy could be developed over the coming years. They have so far made little progress in agreeing joint legislation.</p>
<p>EU officials said the talks would focus on cooperation in criminal, adminstrative and civil law an issue also being addressed within the EU's inter-governmental conference.</p>
