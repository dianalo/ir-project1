<p>Cyclical lows, a weak economy and a strong New Zealand dollar conspired to drag Carter Holt Harvey's first quarter profit down, but the company said on Thursday conditions should improve as the year progresses.</p>
<p>CHH, just over half-owned by International Paper of the U.S., reported first quarter earnings of NZ$49 million (US$31.5 million), down 13 percent on the same 1996 quarter.</p>
<p>Chief executive John Faraci said market conditions continued to erode gains made by the company in productivity and in cost reduction.</p>
<p>&quot;In a number of our markets, prices are just beginning to improve from their cyclical lows. However, the fundamentals for several of the company's businesses are strengthening and modest price improvements have been achieved in the second quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the forests business, volumes were up, largely offsetting price pressure.</p>
<p>Prices for bleached kraft pulp increased to an average US$518 per tonne in July from US$450 in the first quarter to June and further price rises appeared sustainable, he said.</p>
<p>However, Faraci expected price increases to be gradual.</p>
<p>&quot;Norscan (pulp) inventories continue to come down and that is a positive sign,&quot; Faraci told a news conference. &quot;The demand for paper in the U.S. is quite strong,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The supply-demand picture had improved and there appeared to be greater discipline on the part of producers to manage their production, he added.</p>
<p>Faraci said he expected the first quarter to represent a low point for the New Zealand company. He saw steady improvements throughout the rest of the financial year &quot;but the market remains extremely competitive&quot;.</p>
<p>As expected, earnings from associated companies fell to NZ$24 million from $32 million. This reflected the impact of low pulp prices on its 30 percent owned associate, Compania de Petroleos de Chile SA (Copec).</p>
<p>Among its business groups, forest and wood products achieved earnings before interest and tax of NZ$30 million against $28 million the same quarter a year earlier. Harvest volumes were 1.8 million tonnes, up 22 percent.</p>
<p>Pulp, paper and tissue acheived EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of NZ$12 million against $7.0 million and sales fell to $267 million from $289 million.</p>
<p>Building products and distribution's EBIT fell to NZ$6.0 million from $8.0 million but sales rose to $110 million from $108 million.</p>
<p>Doyle Paterson Brown analyst David Stanley said the first quarter was &quot;awful&quot; for the company but largely as expected.</p>
<p>&quot;These are tough times. One can't get around the fact that the returns generated at the moment are still well below what analysts would like or CHH itself would like to see.</p>
<p>&quot;You could not describe it as a good result and they are certainly not saying that. It was an awful result really, but expected, by and large,&quot; Stanley told Reuters.</p>
<p>But he said CHH should report successively better numbers as the company progresses through the financial year.</p>
<p>Analysts have recently been revising down their expectations for CHH's full-year profit to around NZ$275 million from an earlier forecast of $300 million, compared with a profit of NZ$251 million in the year to March, 1997. ($=1.56NZ$)</p>
