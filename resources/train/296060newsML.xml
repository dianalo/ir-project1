<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates in 1997 and may even ease policy in the second half, T.C. Chan, head of commercial and investment banking for Citibank in Hong Kong, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We see no Fed tightening and one Fed easing in the third or fourth quarter that could bring the funds rate down to five percent at year-end,&quot; Chan said in an address to bank customers.</p>
<p>In a poll taken by Reuters on Wednesday, U.S. economists on average predicted that the Fed would raise the federal funds rate to 5.50 percent from its current 5.25 percent by July and then hold rates steady for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>But Chan said he expects the U.S. economy to advance at a two to 2.5 percent clip and prices to rise about 2.5 percent, rates consistent with the Fed's criteria for price stability.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm of the view that domestic demand in the U.S. gradually is slowing down despite the unexpected rise in new home sales and consumer confidence. I don't see any evidence that the U.S. economy will suddenly zoom above this two to three percent trajectory in the coming quarters,&quot; said Chan.</p>
<p>But growth will be uneven, slowing towards the second half of the year and paving the way for a possible credit easing, Chan told Reuters later.  </p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. economy probably grew at 2.8 percent in 1996 and I expect that strength will carry forward into the first and second quarters of 1997,&quot; Chan said.</p>
<p>&quot;After that we may see a dip below two percent, in which case it may necessitate a revision of the current policy because one can argue that (the United States) has a pretty tight monetary environment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. benchmark 30-year bond yield should fluctuate between six and 7.2 percent, ending 1997 at near six percent, he said. The long bond yielded 6.84 percent at the U.S. close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chan said a correction in the U.S. stock market of &quot;five or even 10 percent would not be surprising&quot;. He said he expects the Dow to trade between 6,000 and 7,000 points.</p>
<p>The dollar should remain well supported, though it could weaken further against the British pound, he said.</p>
<p>Chan predicted the dollar will trade in a range of 108-120 yen, but that it will &quot;look shaky&quot; above 120 yen. The dollar was at trading around 116 yen in the Asian afternoon on Thursday.</p>
<p>He sees the dollar trading in a range of 1.50-1.68 German marks, versus 1.5765 on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Sterling could rise to $1.72 , or $1.75 &quot;if it overshoots&quot;, Chan said. The pound was at 1.6945 on Thursday.</p>
<p>The outlook for Japan is one of &quot;gradual recovery at best&quot;, he said, adding that, to fuel growth, the Bank of Japan will remain accomodative.</p>
<p>In Europe, the German economy will grow at a two percent rate, with inflation staying low at two percent and unemployment high at 10.5 percent, he said. The Bundesbank will continue to cut rates.</p>
<p>Chan said the U.K. economy would be the most healthy among the major European countries, with growth near four percent, inflation at 3.5 percent and unemployment at 6.5 percent.</p>
