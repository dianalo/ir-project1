<p>Singapore stocks were firmer at mid-morning on Monday as the Singapore dollar took a breather from recent falls, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still some concern over regional currencies but there is this perception that downside (on the stock market) is limited,&quot; said a dealer with a local institution.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was hoping Singapore's June non-oil export data, due for release later in the day, would lend support.</p>
<p>At 0230 GMT, the Straits Times Industrials Index rose 11.25 points to 1,935.48. The Singapore dollar appeared to have steadied at 1.4627/37 compared to a low of 1.4665 on Friday, underpinned by an increase in interbank interest rates in Singapore.</p>
<p>Total turnover was a moderate 68.5 million shares, with 142 gainers to 71 losers.</p>
<p>A mixed bag of small-capitalised stocks dominated trade.</p>
<p>Plastic injection maker AsiaMatrix, whose shares resumed trading on Monday fter a suspension ended by a takeover bid announcement, topped the actives with more than 14 million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>A private firm announced a takeover bid for 50.98 percent of AsiaMatrix its shares at S$1.45 each. The shares rose 25 cents to Singapore $1.63 against its pre-suspension close of S$1.38 on June 27.</p>
<p>Book publisher Popular Holding hit a new high of S$0.60 on a turnover of 4.8 million shares on its earnings prospects.</p>
<p>Dealers said U.S. dollar-denominated stocks continued to fare well, notably small-capitalised manufacturing stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;A weaker Sing dollar is benficial to the manufacturing export companies,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Selected banking blue chips saw some value-hunting following recent losses.</p>
