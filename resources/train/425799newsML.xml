<p>An injury which looked set to rule out Karlsruhe midfielder Thomas Haessler for the rest of the season is less serious than first thought.</p>
<p>Medical examinations late on Thursday revealed the break in the 30-year-old's left leg was not as severe as experts had feared but he will still be out for six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Haessler will be operated on in a local hospital at the weekend and may be fit for Karlsruhe's German Cup semifinal with regional league side Energie Cottbus in mid-April.</p>
<p>But the injury comes at a bad time for the club, who will be without all three of their national squad players for Saturday's league match against St Pauli. The other two players, striker Sean Dundee and wing-back Michael Tarnat, are also injured.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no point complaining. You always have to live with injuries,&quot; club president Roland Schmider said. &quot;But it's unfortunate that it's happened to three of our best first-team players at the same time.&quot;</p>
<p>Haessler has just returned to the Karlsruhe line-up after a complex ankle fracture which he sustained in November.</p>
