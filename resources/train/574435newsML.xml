<p>The Heat hesitated, and were lost.</p>
<p>The New York Knicks' 77-73 victory over the Miami Heat in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinals Sunday was built on a defence that allowed just four points in the last four minutes, one inside the last three and none in the final 2:51.</p>
<p>A moment's hesitation cost Tim Hardaway the chance to get off the potential game-tying shot.</p>
<p>With three seconds to go and the Knicks up by three points, New York centre Patrick Ewing, jumping out to double-team, blocked the Miami guard's 3-point attempt.</p>
<p>&quot;I tried to shoot over him,&quot; said Hardaway. &quot;He's 7-1 (2.16 metres). He blocked the shot and that was the game.&quot;</p>
<p>Miami coach Pat Riley said Hardaway had an open look until he faked a shot before firing.</p>
<p>&quot;Timmy had the look on the catch,&quot; said Riley. &quot;I think probably if he just went with it on the catch instead of shot-faking it he could have gotten it airborne.&quot;</p>
<p>Did Hardaway think the shot had a chance? &quot;Yeah, when I was about to shoot it -- but when it got blocked, no.&quot;</p>
<p>The situation dictated that Hardaway shoot from outside the 3-point line, and that Ewing chase him there.</p>
<p>&quot;Patrick always jumps out, he always helps out on defence,&quot; said Hardaway. &quot;If it was early in the game, I would have gone by him, but we needed a three, we were down by three.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We wanted, if they were going to score, to give them two points instead of three, so I just stepped out,&quot; said Ewing.</p>
<p>&quot;Usually if they run that play during the course of the game my job would have been to stay back and guard the paint and let the (Knicks') guard fight over the top.&quot;</p>
<p>A split second of indecision had also dragged Heat centre Alonzo Mourning into a key travelling violation with 1:20 to go as he got the ball out high and tried to choose between shooting the long shot and driving to the basket. Unfortunately, he did a little of both.</p>
<p>&quot;You want to go to the hole, drive, not rely on the jump shot all the time,&quot; said Mourning.</p>
<p>&quot;I should have just caught it and shot it. I thought about driving. They called me for travelling.&quot;</p>
<p>On the Heat's next possession, they again failed to convert. Hardaway had to unleash a desperation 3-pointer with 32 seconds to go in the game. The shot missed the rim, resulting in a 24-second violation.</p>
<p>Riley said some of the Heat players were passing the buck to Hardaway, allowing the Knicks to concentrate on him.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody loads up on Tim and we missed at least three opportunities for other players to make the play. Sometimes they look to other people,&quot; said Riley.</p>
<p>&quot;They were just playing good defence. We just couldn't get a shot off and we couldn't get it down low either. They picked up their defence in the last couple minutes,&quot; said Hardaway.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a combination of things,&quot; said Mourning. &quot;They played good defence, we didn't execute well.&quot;</p>
<p>But the game really turned in the third quarter -- as games have all season against the Heat.</p>
<p>&quot;The third quarters have been something of an omen for us,&quot; said Mourning. &quot;We come out in the third quarter and just lose leads. I don't know what it is.</p>
<p>&quot;Lack of maturity? We stop being into the game at that time, relaxing, thinking that we got a comfortable lead, we can withstand the pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>In the third quarter, the Knicks trimmed an eight-point halftime deficit to one. &quot;We gave them a little light and they kicked the door open,&quot; said Mourning.</p>
<p>&quot;We had them on the ropes, we had them rolling, had them on the run,&quot; said Riley. &quot;We just let down in the third quarter. We got a little tentative, started turning the basketball over.&quot;</p>
<p>Why the Knicks' third-quarter magic against the Heat? &quot;I don't know, I really don't,&quot; said New York coach Jeff Van Gundy.</p>
<p>But one thing he did know: &quot;We played terrific defence.&quot;</p>
<p>Noting that with each game, the teams were scoring fewer points, Van Gundy said, a bit wistfully: &quot;One of these games is going to surprise all of us and be an offensive game.</p>
<p>&quot;Both teams are even right down the line. The team that makes the most plays down the stretch is going to win the game and the series.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The two best defensive teams in the league, field goal percentage-wise,&quot; Riley noted.</p>
<p>The Heat's 73 points were the fewest the Knicks had ever allowed in a playoff game and the fewest Miami had ever scored in a postseason contest.</p>
