<p>Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin return to Earth on Thursday after perhaps the toughest assignment in the history of manned space flights.</p>
<p>The two cosmonauts will leave the Mir space station at 9.50 a.m. Moscow time (0550 GMT) having said farewell to their two Russian replacements and NASA astronaut Michael Foale, who has shared many of the recent dramas on Mir.</p>
<p>After some time preparing their Soyuz spacecraft for de-docking, it should take them less than four hours to plunge down to the steppes of the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, where they are due to land at 4.16 p.m. Moscow time (1216 GMT).</p>
<p>Over the past six months crew commander Tsibliyev and flight engineer Lazutkin have battled with a fire, a series of problems with their life support systems and a devastating power failure after the worst accident ever aboard the 11-year-old station.</p>
<p>&quot;Space officials cannot recall such a complicated mission in our whole history of manned space expeditions,&quot; Itar-Tass news agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But while they will leave many worries behind them on the stricken space station, it will be hard for them not to be haunted by the past as they hurtle to Earth.</p>
<p>In 1971 the capsule carrying the three pioneers on Moscow's first space station Salyut touched down after a successful mission hailed throughout the then Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But when excited ground staff opened the hatch they found that all three men had died on the way down, killed by a sudden drop in pressure during reentry into the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>Sixteen years later two cosmonauts undocked from the Mir space station which had replaced Salyut expecting a trouble-free return to Earth.</p>
<p>They did land safely, but only after a nightmarish two days in what the Izvestia newspaper called &quot;a lone boat drifting on a boundless ocean&quot; after failing to align properly for reentry.</p>
<p>Such incidents stand out amid the many space missions which followed Russian Yuri Gagarin's pioneering flight into space in 1965. Most of the space flights have gone relatively smoothly.</p>
<p>Like the weary Mir crew, one of whom pulled out a plug on a computer by mistake while battling with the power problems, space officials have learnt from their mistakes. They do not expect any big problems with Thursday's landing.</p>
<p>A fleet of helicopters will be on hand to track the capsule after a huge parachute opens to slow its fall once it enters Earth's atmosphere. Rescue officials and mission control outside Moscow will also have radio contact with the craft.</p>
<p>One official said Tsibliyev would not even need to take special pills during the return flight for a heart condition he developed due to the stress of being on Mir.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no special medication or measures for his return; everything is routine,&quot; Irina Alfyerova, head of Mission Control's medical group, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;He's just taking the usual at the final stage of the flight, such as vitamin supplements and mineral-salted water.&quot;</p>
