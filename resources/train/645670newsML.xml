<p>Mauritius may have a reputation as a sun-kissed island paradise, but local opposition politicians and economists warn that storm clouds are gathering ahead of Monday's release of the annual budget.</p>
<p>&quot;This government is functioning as smoothly as a three-wheeled car on flat tyres driven on a potholed road,&quot; was how one resident summed up the performance of Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam's coalition since its election in 1995.</p>
<p>Ramgoolam's government -- a combination of the Labour Party and leftist Mauritius Militant Movement (MMM) -- is under fire for failing to deliver on election pledges to revitalise the economy and improve ordinary lives.</p>
<p>Analysts say it risks a backlash.</p>
<p>The Joint Economic Council, a private sector economic policy coordinating group, recently expressed concern over low investor confidence and urged the government to use its new budget to make amends.</p>
<p>&quot;Confidence between government and the private sector is a vital factor in economic development and any loss of such confidence would only entail negative impact on the economy,&quot; the JEC said in an appeal to Finance Minister Vasant Bunwaree.</p>
<p>It said the budget should focus on deficit reduction, the pursuit of a coherent monetary and foreign exchange policy and increased economic integration.</p>
<p>FAILED TO DELIVER</p>
<p>Ramgoolam came to power in December 1995, bringing to an end the 13-year reign of Anerood Jugnauth, who was rejected under a barrage of charges including corruption, ethnic bias and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Ramgoolam's election platform promised a clean sweep of government including extensive democracy, transparency and enhanced economic management and prosperity leading to the next century.</p>
<p>But many now say he has failed to deliver.</p>
<p>&quot;Charges of incompetency, over-centralization, lack of collective responsibility in cabinet, constant feuding in parliament, corruption and mismanagement have severely sullied the government's image in the public's eye,&quot; Mauritius Consumers Association General-Secretary Jayen Chellum told Reuters.</p>
<p>Another economist accused Ramgoolam's government of lacking vision on the future of Mauritius and of adopting &quot;fire-fighting and a management-by-crisis attitude in governing&quot;.</p>
<p>The nation's economy is heavily dependent on earnings from export processing zones, sugar production, tourism and financial services.</p>
<p>But with an educated population and relatively low unemployment, experts believe it is well placed to command a key role in trade between Africa and Asia given its strategic Indian Ocean location.</p>
<p>That potential is not borne out by economic data.</p>
<p>&quot;The island has been spared from cyclones since the beginning of the year, so a growth estimate of 5.0 percent in 1997 does not sound good,&quot; said Kishore Deerpalsigh, a Labour Party backbencher and economist at management consultants Price Waterhouse.</p>
<p>He said private-sector investors were discouraged by high inflation -- 7.5 percent in 1996/97 from 5.8 percent the previous year.</p>
<p>LACK OF CONFIDENCE HURTS STOCK EXCHANGE</p>
<p>He also said a lack of confidence in the economy was responsible for the slow growth of the Stock Exchange of Mauritius where the Semdex index has grown just 13.66 percent since January of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Better to deposit one's money in the banks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The government has pledged a local fund to invest and promote liquidity on the stock market, but this has so far failed to materialise.</p>
<p>It has also organised road shows in Southeast Asia to promote its financial services, export processing and service industries, but economists say these areas generate little real grass-roots benefit.</p>
<p>Xavier-Luc Duval, a minister in Jugnauth's defeated government and also an economist at consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, suggested a split in the Labour-MMM alliance could revitalise the government.</p>
<p>&quot;There are strong diverging views between members of Labour-MMM on the way the country should be managed. For the sake of the country, it will be better to have a friendly parting of the ways,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But another economist said government attention was now focused on balancing the budget, although it had ignored structural macroeconomic changes needed to restore a longer-term equilibrium.</p>
<p>The government has so far kept largely silent, although Ramgoolam has called for patience while they try to correct the ills of the prevous administration. Finance minister Bunwaree has said his strategy will be outlined in his budget speech.</p>
