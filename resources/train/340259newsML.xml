<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Weak bullion knocks S.African golds to close down.</title>
<headline>Weak bullion knocks S.African golds to close down.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG</dateline>

<p>South African gold shares took a battering on Wednesday as the bullion price lost all Tuesday's gains and fell to $351 an ounce, threatening to test the key $350 an ounce level.</p>
<p>Having climbed nearly five percent on Tuesday, riding the brief rally in the gold price, gold shares shed more than three percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said the strong rand -- last bid at 4.5600 against the dollar -- had compounded weakness by eroding any support metal stocks might have won from it.</p>
<p>The gold index lost 43.8 points to 1,385.3 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said that a significant end to losses on the gold board was unlikely to take place in the near future.</p>
<p>Industrial shares also took a bashing, with the index shedding 48.5 points to 6,687.5.</p>
<p>Local shares were punished by volatility on Wall Street, which saw the U.S. stock market gain 100 points before shredding these gains to end weaker.</p>
<p>Overall trade had been mixed, dealers said.</p>
<p>Weakness in golds and industrials combined to knock the all-share index 48.5 points down to 6,687.5.</p>
