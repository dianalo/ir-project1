<p>Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Vice Minister Sun Zhenyu said Wednesday that China recognizes U.S. concerns about the growing trade gap between the two countries and is looking for ways to promote more U.S. imports.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we recognize the trade deficit issue is of great concern in this country,&quot; Sun said in a speech to an Economic Strategy Institute trade conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall work very closely with our U.S. counterparts to promote U.S. exports to China,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Last year the U.S. trade deficit with China hit nearly $40 billion, up from $34 billion the year before.</p>
<p>Sun said that China will continue to carry out economic reforms and lower import tariffs as part of its bid to join the World Trade Organization.  He also said that China would move to further open markets for services.</p>
<p>But he said that domestic financial institutions in China were fragile and needed time to grow in strength in order to be able to compete with powerful foreign financial institutions.</p>
<p>He said that developed countries should pay attention to the needs of developing countries.  He said if developed nations were not careful about the needs of developing nations, the gap between developed and developing nations would become much wider, which would not be beneficial.</p>
<p>On Hong Kong, Sun said he believed that if the handover to Chinese rule were handled properly, Hong Kong &quot;will be an asset in Chinese relations with the outside world.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said that he thought the United States and China could work together to promote world prosperity.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my belief that our two nations can and will work together to promote world prosperity and progress,&quot; Sun said.</p>
