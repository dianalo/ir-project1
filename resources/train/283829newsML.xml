<p>In some countries, a prime minister able to declare victory 10 days ahead of an election might take a relaxed attitude toward campaigning.</p>
<p>But Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong worked the hustings for Thursday's general election as though his political survival depended on it.</p>
<p>That was despite the fact that Goh's People's Action Party (PAP) was already guaranteed continued power because opposition candidates contested just 36 of 83 parliamentary seats at stake.</p>
<p>In the campaign that followed, Goh and the PAP still pulled out all the stops. Their tactics ranged from non-stop meet-the-voter walkabouts to telling voters they would be last in line for government goodies if they supported the opposition.</p>
<p>The PAP also made harsh attacks on key opposition candidates, calling one a &quot;proven liar&quot; and another a &quot;Chinese chauvinist&quot; who threatened Singapore's racial harmony.</p>
<p>The PAP approach paid off. The party ended up not just holding its own but cutting opposition seats from four to two. Its share of the vote rose from 61 percent to 65 percent.</p>
<p>Goh had said his credibility was on the line. If the PAP failed to carry a key constituency where he campaigned heavily, &quot;I will be seen as a much smaller man,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As the PM, my word in future will have less weight both internationally as well as in Singapore. I fight to win. I cannot lose.&quot;</p>
<p>Failure to achieve a less-than-overwhelming victory could even raise concern about challenges to his leadership, Goh said.</p>
<p>Indeed, some political analysts agreed the loss of even a few seats to the opposition could hurt Goh's position.</p>
<p>&quot;If the opposition wins eight to 10 seats, it could jeopardise Goh's premiership,&quot; Bruce Gale, an analyst at Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, said ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>In the last elections in 1991, Goh's first as prime minister, a slight drop in the PAP percentage of the vote and an opposition increase in seats from one to four caused much soul-searching within the PAP and a policy review.</p>
<p>That reflected a political history which, under predecessor Lee Kuan Yew, had seen no opposition members win election to parliament from independence in 1965 until 1981. The four elected in 1991 were the highest number in a post-independence election.</p>
<p>The results announced early on Friday were likely to end lingering questions about the leadership ability of Goh, originally seen by some analysts as a seat-warmer in the shadow of Lee, and put him in a solid position to lead Singapore into the next century.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a watershed election. I am satisfied with the result,&quot; Goh said.</p>
<p>The results clear the way for continued pursuit of the PAP's pro-business policies, receptive to foreign investment and conservative in the handling of public funds.</p>
<p>Opposition parties had called for a looser purse, more attention to the needs of Singapore's less well-off groups, and more liberal policies on press freedom and in the tough justice system.</p>
<p>Goh said the results showed Singaporeans &quot;have rejected Western-style liberal democracy and freedoms, putting individual rights over that of society&quot;.</p>
<p>His campaign emphasised economic pragmatism over less tangible values, pointing to the PAP's record of making Singapore one of Asia's most prosperous countries, with average per capita income higher than in Britain, the old colonial power.</p>
<p>Opposition hopes fizzled that a relative economic slowdown might become an issue. A fourth quarter bounce-back put 1996 growth at 6.5 percent compared with 8.8 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>A key campaign issue for the ruling party was the promise of a multi-billion dollar programme to upgrade public housing.</p>
<p>Goh told voters that areas returning opposition MPs would risk becoming slums in 20 to 30 years' time.</p>
<p>That approach drew criticism from the U.S. State Department, which Goh in turn accused of interfering in Singapore's domestic affairs.</p>
