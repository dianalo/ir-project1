<p>Triton Energy Ltd said Monday it has again discovered both oil and natural gas on Block A-18 in the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
<p>The Senja Field is the fifth field found by Triton on the block since exploratory drilling began in the area in 1995, the company said. It has a 50 percent working interest there, as does Petronas Carigali (JDA) Sdn. Bhd, an exploration and production subsidiary of Malaysian state oil firm Petronas.</p>
<p>On test, the Senja-1 exploratory well flowed at a combined daily rate of 2,725 barrels of oil, 39 million cubic feet of gas and 368 barrels of condensate from selected intervals.  </p>
<p>The find is located in the northwest corner of Block A-18.</p>
<p>&quot;Senja-1 is the first well drilled on an entirely new play fairway on the block,&quot; said Al Turner, Triton senior vice president, operations.  &quot;We are pleased about discovering oil and gas in this location.&quot;</p>
<p>The well was flow tested from four intervals between 4,756 and 6,986 feet through choke sizes ranging from 24/64-inch to two inches.  Flowing tubing pressure was between 409 and 2,209 pounds per square inch, Triton said.</p>
<p>The oil was 37-46 degrees gravity, and the condensate was 44-45 degrees gravity.</p>
<p>The Senja-1 was drilled in about 179 feet of water to a depth of 7,600 feet.</p>
<p>During 1997, Triton said, it plans to drill additional exploratory wells on the block, as well as appraise and delineate the Bumi Field.  The rig that drilled the Senja-1 well will move east of the Bumi Field to drill an exploratory well on another untested prospect.</p>
