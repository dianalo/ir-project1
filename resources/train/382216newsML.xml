<p>Chinese defence minister Chi Haotian on Monday called for closer cooperation between the armed forces of China and the Philippines in talks with his counterpart, Renato de Villa.</p>
<p>But the thorny issue of the two countries' rival claims to the disputed Spratly Islands was not discussed in the hour-long talks and would be left to their respective foreign ministries, de Villa told reporters.</p>
<p>He said Chi was pleased with the &quot;very strong&quot; relations between the two armed forces. &quot;He is proposing that we do some more activities together along this direction.&quot;</p>
<p>De Villa did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The Spratlys are a cluster of potentially oil-rich isles, reefs and shoals in the South China Sea which are claimed wholly or in part by the two countries as well as by Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei.</p>
<p>Chi, speaking through an interpreter, said the two ministers agreed to push bilateral cooperation to &quot;new levels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the unsolved problems can be solved through consultations and peaceful means,&quot; Chi said.</p>
<p>Chinese President Jiang Zemin and President Fidel Ramos agreed in talks in Manila last November to set aside the dispute and work instead at jointly developing the contested area.</p>
<p>Tensions in relations between the two countries escalated in 1995 when Ramos accused the Chinese of building what looked like naval support facilities on Mischief Reef which Manila claims.</p>
<p>The Chinese said they were shelters for fishermen and have not dismantled them. &quot;Our problem (over the Spratlys) will have to be worked out between the two governments,&quot; de Villa said. &quot;There will be no provocative action or anything like that to be done by either side.&quot;</p>
<p>Chi, who arrived last weekend for a six-day visit, is to call on President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday. He leaves for Indonesia on Thursday.</p>
