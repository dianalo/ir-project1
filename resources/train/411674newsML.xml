<headline>Dutch rate hike seen as bid to prop up guilder.</headline>

<p>The Dutch central bank's decision to raise its special advances rate on Thursday was a direct response to recent weakness in the Dutch guilder against the German mark, economists and dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said the Dutch currency's fall this week was the result of a variety of factors including the wide gulf between the special advances rate and Germany's equivalent, the repo rate.</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate trigger for the rate hike was the depreciation of the guilder,&quot; said Rabobank International economist Hans Honig.</p>
<p>The Dutch central bank lifted the special advances rate, which sets the tone for money market rates, to 2.70 basis points, 30 basis points below the repo rate, from 2.50 points.</p>
<p>Dutch bonds and money market rates barely reacted to the news as it was widely expected by market participants.</p>
<p>It was the first move in the money market intervention rate since last August, when the rate was lowered by 20 basis points in response to a 30 basis point repo rate cut by the Bundesbank.</p>
<p>A Dutch central bank spokesman said the hike was merely intended to bring the advances rate into line with Dutch money market rates and denied it was prompted by guilder weakness.</p>
<p>However market players took a different view.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers European economist Wike Groenenberg said the Dutch currency had depreciated significantly against the German unit in recent weeks, forcing the central bank to act.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't want to see the currency move too fast in one direction,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The mark jumped to a recent peak of 1.1246 guilders on Tuesday from 1.1215 a week earlier, and compared with a low of 1.1160 in May 1996. At 1225 GMT today it was trading at 1.1243.</p>
<p>The Dutch central bank has a long-standing policy of pegging the guilder tightly to the mark.</p>
<p>Honig said the recent guilder weakness may have been partly caused by investors switching from Dutch bonds into German Bunds, adding that the fall may have been excessive.</p>
<p>He did not see inflation as a factor in the Dutch rate hike, although it has been rising in line with the growing domestic economy and is higher than in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;The medium term inflation outlook is not that bad because wage increases remain very modest,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dutch inflation was running at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in January, compared with 1.8 percent in Germany.</p>
<p>One dealer attributed the rate hike partly to the guilder and partly to the wide differential between the special advances rate and money market rates, which had reached 60-70 basis points before the rate hike.</p>
<p>He said the move indicated the Dutch central bank did not just cut interest rates, adding to its credibility.</p>
<p>The hike was not reversible and signalled the starting of a tightening of monetary policy, he said.</p>
<p>But others said future interest rate moves in the Netherlands would depend above all on the guilder/mark rate.</p>
