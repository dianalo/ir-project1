<p>The Polish zloty, bruised by a 1.5 point fall against the basket of currencies on foreign selling, stabilised at just below one percent above the parity rate but dealers said it could move either way on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the zloty's early drop on Thursday was a hiccup caused by the fall of the Czech crown, which placed a shadow over the whole region, even though Polish fundamentals were very good.</p>
<p>They said the Czech central bank's decision to raise the one-week repo rate to 75 percent and limit access of non-resident investors to the Czech money market prompted a wave of zloty selling.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors are cutting central European exposure in general after the Czech crisis. It does not seem to have anything to do with Poland in particular,&quot; said Andrzej Rzysko, chief dealer at Societe Generale in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Dealers said the fall of the zloty was caused not so much by Polish T-bill or bond sales, in which trade was relatively small, but more in other zloty-related derivatives, spot transactions and certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade on the T-bill market was not very big today, foreign investors were selling zlotys through many other instruments,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the zloty could fall down to the trading band centre tomorrow if foreign investors continued to pull out of the region.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the parity rate will prove to be a very strong support level and people will realise that selling the zloty has no real justification,&quot; said Witold Wozniak, forex dealer at Deutsche Bank in Warsaw.</p>
<p>When the zloty started to slide early in the day the National Bank of Poland said it was comfortable with the Polish unit's weakening to around 1.9 percent and would be closely watching its further moves.</p>
<p>But even though the zloty refused to be talked up and fell to below one percent above the trading band centre, the NBP did not intervene to support it.</p>
<p>Some dealers said that Thursday's 12-percent five-year bond tender was the first signal that the bearish zloty trend could soon reverse and the zloty could return to investors' grace.</p>
<p>&quot;There are first signs that at the current low levels some foreign investors are again becoming interested in the zloty and it might be on its way up again soon,&quot; said Wojciech Kowalczyk, T-bill and bond dealer at Bank Handlowy SA.</p>
<p>Dealers said foreigners placed several dozen million dollars worth of bids at the 12-percent five-year bond tender today, against a 300 million zloty offer and total demand of 406 million zlotys.</p>
<p>At 1200 GMT the zloty closed at 3.1950/3.2000 against the dollar after 3.1600/50 at the opening and at 1.8880/972 against the mark, from 1.8530/65 at opening.</p>
<p>It was at 1.03/0.73 above the trading band centre, down from 2.44/2.27 percent at opening.</p>
