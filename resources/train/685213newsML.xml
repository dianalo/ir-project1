<p>Monica Seles and Jana Novotna offered crumbs of comfort to Wimbledon fans expecting a feast of entertainment on Wednesday as rain permitted less than two hours play on the third day of the 111th championships.</p>
<p>Seles and Novotna, seeded second and third respectively in the women's draw, were the only two winners on an otherwise soggy afternoon which narrowly avoided the distinction of being the first completely blank day at the All England Club since 1992.</p>
<p>British hopes Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, as well as defending champion Richard Krajicek, were scheduled as the main attractions, but in the event Seles' one-sided contest with Australian Rachel McQuillan was the only Centre Court match to be completed.</p>
<p>Even Seles, who had already waited two days to hit a ball in anger, was forced to endure a frustrating wait after racing into a 6-0 5-2 lead against an opponent playing her first singles match on in the famous arena.</p>
<p>Rain then intervened at the crucial moment, causing a further 45-minute delay, before the Yugoslav-born second seed returned to wrap up a 6-0 6-2 victory which she admitted did nothing to improve her currently fragile mood.</p>
<p>Seles' father remains seriously ill with cancer and, not surprisingly, even the possibility of a first Wimbledon title is failing to grab his daughter's full attention.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point it's the furthest thing from my mind,&quot; she admitted. &quot;I'm going through a pretty tough time right now. I guess you have these stages and I've got to get right through it.</p>
<p>&quot;What's going on elsewhere in my life is much bigger than tennis. They're two different things.&quot;</p>
<p>Even so, Seles did concede that her serve remains a shadow of its former self since she ended her two-year absence from the game and much the same applies to her level of fitness.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not in the ideal physical shape I would like to be,&quot; she admitted. &quot;I'm trying to improve it.&quot;</p>
<p>McQuillan, though, felt even a half-fit Seles was a formidable proposition. &quot;I had that awful feeling that she could hit anything anywhere,&quot; the Australian admitted.</p>
<p>Novotna, in contrast, briefly looked in trouble against Wiltrud Probst of Germany before reasserting herself in the final set to win 6-4 4-6 6-0.</p>
<p>&quot;She was playing really well and hit a lot of winners,&quot; said Novotna, attempting to explain the second set. &quot;It was the best she has ever played against me.&quot;</p>
<p>The other 77 matches scheduled, however, were carried over to Thursday when referee Alan Mills will hope to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the forecast for the rest of the week is not encouraging, and play on outside courts on Thursday will start an hour earlier than usual at 1000GMT. Play on Centre and Number One Court will begin at 1100GMT, two hours ahead of normal.</p>
