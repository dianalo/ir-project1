<p>South Korean state prosecutors grilled President Kim Young-sam's son for the second day on Saturday over a loan-for-kickbacks scandal that has rocked the nation.</p>
<p>A prosecution official said Kim Hyun-chul was being questioned over a criminal libel complaint he lodged on Tuesday against six opposition politicians who had alleged he pressured banks to offer loans to financially shaky Hanbo Steel Co.</p>
<p>&quot;A wide range of issues are being investigated,&quot; the official told Reuters. &quot;They include all suspicions surrounding him.&quot;</p>
<p>He said prosecutors would soon summon the six politicians from the main opposition National Congress for New Politics for questioning as part of the probe into the libel complaint.</p>
<p>The six include party spokesman Chung Dong-young, his deputy Sul Hoon and three other members of parliament.</p>
<p>The official said suspicions raised by the opposition included whether the junior Kim received huge donations in return for pressuring banks to extend loans to the troubled steelmaker. Another question was whether Kim Hyun-chul had close ties to sons of Hanbo Group founder Chung Tae-soo.</p>
<p>Hanbo Steel is the flagship of the Hanbo Group, South Korea's 14th largest conglomerate.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun-chul, the president's second son, has said he had nothing to do with $5.8 billion of loans that the steelmaker racked up before being declared insolvent on January 23.</p>
<p>A recent survey by a monthly news magazine showed 66 percent of 1,068 people polled believed Kim Hyun-chul was involved in the Hanbo scandal, and 70 percent thought President Kim himself should be investigated over the case if necessary.</p>
<p>The survey by WIN magazine showed that about 73 percent of those polled believed the president's reform policies had failed. Kim Young-sam launched an anti-corruption drive as his top reform policy shortly after taking office in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;The aftermath of the latest scandal involving National Assemblymen and administration officials will make it difficult for President Kim to maintain his credibility for the remainder of his term,&quot; the Korea Herald said in an editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;Bold and sustained reforms, in keeping with his earlier promises, are essential to his survival of this test.&quot;</p>
<p>President Kim, whose single five-year term expires early next year, is due to make a statement next week on the political situation, government officials said.</p>
<p>Speculation that Kim Hyun-chul had close ties with Hanbo was fanned by the discovery last week of more than 10,000 copies of a book written by him in a Hanbo Group warehouse in Seoul.</p>
<p>The opposition has said the books found in the warehouse proved that Hanbo had been a sponsor of Kim Hyun-chul.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, prosecutors indicted 10 people in the scandal, including Hanbo Group founder Chung and three close associates of the president, on bribery and embezzlement charges.</p>
<p>But opposition parties have demanded a new probe, saying prosecutors have failed to uncover the &quot;real big hands&quot; in the scandal. Both the National Congress and the United Liberal Democratic Party have called for special legislation to allow independent prosecutors to restart the probe.</p>
<p>&quot;If Kim Hyun-chul is so innocent and honorable, he should appear in parliament and explain his innocence,&quot; said a National Congress statement on Saturday.</p>
