<p>Japan's consumer spending is gradually recovering despite a large drop in household spending in June from a year earlier, an official of the government's Management and Coordination Agency told reporters on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The recovery in consumer spending, although it is gradual, remains firm,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The agency said earlier that household spending had fallen a real 4.7 percent in June from the same month last year, the largest drop since November 1974, when it fell 5.9 percent.</p>
<p>But the official said a number of special factors had pushed down the June figure and that household spending for the January-June period, which fell 0.2 percent from the same period last year, was &quot;a reasonable result&quot;.  </p>
<p>He said taking account of the effect of last year having been a leap year, the comparison for January-June this year might otherwise have been a positive figure.</p>
<p>He added that household spending had shown falls on a half-yearly basis since the latter half of 1992, with the exception of the first half of last year.</p>
<p>June household spending had fallen due to bad weather, in particular two typhoons which had fallen on weekends, as well as a lingering fall-off in demand after the rise in the sales tax on April 1. The tax was raised to five percent from three percent.</p>
