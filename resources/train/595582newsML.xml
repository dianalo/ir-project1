<headline>Euro oil swaps flat except &quot;catch-up&quot; light ends.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>European oil swaps were flat on Monday apart from stronger gasoline and naphtha.</p>
<p>Traders said the thin volume was related to public holidays in much of Europe.</p>
<p>Gasoline and naphtha were $2-4 a tonne firmer on the back of attempts to catch up with crude's late Friday gains.</p>
<p>June naphtha was heard done at $191 a tonne while gasoline paper was concluded at $208.50. Physical barges traded at $208 and $209.25 and the market was pegged around $209-210 around 1200 GMT.</p>
<p>Although naphtha firmed on Monday its longer-term prospects were less bullish with several dealers anticipating a tranquil market in June.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs were flat with no deals heard. Traders said it was a normal slow Monday compounded by public holidays. This week was around 20 cents under June, with next week about one cent weaker at 19 cents under.</p>
<p>Gas oil crack spreads were pegged around $4.85-90 a barrel for Q4, only marginally stronger than Friday, while Q1 98 remained backwardated around a flat $4.75.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel swaps were little changed on prompt periods but brokers said the third quarter edged up about $1 a tonne.</p>
<p>June barges were pegged around $86.50 a tonne with July $87.50 and the third quarter at $88.50.</p>
<p>Low sulphur remains about $10 a tonne above barges on the prompt end of the market, slipping to about $7 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Dealers said the strength on prompt reflected demand from the United States which helped lift quotations about $5 a tonne last Friday.</p>
<p>But that firmness was offset by sluggish demand for Rotterdam barges and growing exports of Russian fuel from St Petersburg.</p>
