<headline>SOCCER-DEPORTIVO BEATEN 2-0 BY SEVILLA IN SPANISH CUP.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-01-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The problems of Deportivo Coruna coach John Toshack worsened on Wednesday when his side went down 2-0 to Sevilla in the first leg of the third round of the Spanish Cup on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the evening had good news for Pepe Carcelen, who saw his Espanyol team come back from a goal down to dispatch Sporting Gijon 4-1. Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Tenerife are still involved in Europe and were exempt from the round.</p>
<p>1994 Cup winners Zaragoza hung on for a 1-1 draw at home to Racing Santander despite having two men sent off, while first division sides facing teams from lower divisions came through largely unscathed.</p>
<p>Real Betis won 1-0 at third division Granada and Athletic Bilbao took their game at Villareal by the same result, but Rayo Vallecano will have to win the return leg of their tie with Osasuna after going down 3-2.</p>
<p>Second division Lleida's tie with Hercules was suspended because of storm damage, while the weather also affected Celta's clash with Logrones, which was held up for nearly half an hour because of a power cut caused by the heavy rain.</p>
