<title>UK: Dlr ends firm in Europe as G7 seen calming market.</title>
<headline>Dlr ends firm in Europe as G7 seen calming market.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>

<p>The dollar ended the European session on a firm note after traders digested weekend comments from finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations (G7) and pulled the U.S. unit up from overnight lows.</p>
<p>The G7 said in statement that the dollar's upward correction over the past two years was now complete and it called for more market stability.</p>
<p>Traders said the comments may increase the risk of extending the dollar's gains sharply from here but they did nothing to alter the economic and interest rate arguments in favour of further dollar strength.  </p>
<p>&quot;The G7 did get across its worries about the speed of the dollar's gains but ultimately there's nothing in here to change the direction and that is still for a higher dollar,&quot; said Henry Wilkes, senior trader at Bank Julius Baer.</p>
<p>At 1615 GMT, the dollar was trading at 1.6565/68 marks compared with an overnight low in the Far East at 1.6350 and an opening rate in Europe at 1.6538/48.</p>
<p>Against the yen, it was at 122.70/75 compared with an overnight low at 120.40 and a European open at 122.85/95.</p>
<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, speaking in Basle today, said markets reacted appropriately to the G7 meeting.  </p>
<p>The G7, meeting in Berlin on Saturday, issued a separate statement on exchange rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The major misalignments in exchange markets noted in our April 1995 communique, have been corrected,&quot; the G7 said. &quot;We reaffirmed our views that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that excess volatility is undesirable.&quot;</p>
<p>Although this fueled additional overnight dollar selling, the U.S. had skidded off fresh multi-year highs late on Friday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin set the tone for the G7 statement in advance. Some say he signalled a subtle change in the administration's long-standing dollar policy.  </p>
<p>Rubin expanded on his oft-repeated comment that a strong dollar is in the U.S. interest and added &quot;we've had a strong dollar for some time.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said this suggests the U.S. definition of a strong dollar is the rates seen in recent months and not further gains.</p>
<p>&quot;The tone of the G7 comments seem to say the dollar has come just a little too far, too fast,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, currency strategist at Merrill Lynch. &quot;While not overtly negative for the dollar, it may create a bit more of a two-way market.&quot;</p>
<p>Other comments surrounding the meeting seemed to support the Rubin line.  </p>
<p>&quot;The dollar correction process ought to end about now,&quot; Bundesbank chief Tietmeyer said Saturday.</p>
<p>Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the Japanese Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, said in Tokyo today that Monday's dollar rate of about 122.50 yen best reflects the G7 call for market stability.</p>
<p>The dollar has risen about 55 percent against the yen and about 23 percent against the mark since the Spring of 1995.</p>
<p>But, since the beginning of this year alone, it has climbed as much as 7.6 percent against the yen and up to 8.9 percent against the mark.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day traders said the glaring post-G7 trading opportunity is to sell marks against the yen.</p>
<p>The Japanese were seen to be far more concerned about a relentless rise in dollar/yen than the Europeans are about a rise in dollar/mark and the Bank of Japan has a formidable $200 billion plus of dollar reserves to sell if it chooses.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, trading was quiet after a hectic event-packed week last week and the lack of major economic data releases or policy-making meetings contributed to a sense of calm over the market today.</p>
