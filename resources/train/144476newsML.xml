<title>YEMEN: Yemen says French diplomat captors drop demands.</title>
<headline>Yemen says French diplomat captors drop demands.</headline>

<p>The kidnappers of a French diplomat in Yemen have dropped their earlier demands and asked for a guarantee that they would not be prosecuted if they release their hostage, a Yemeni official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The kidnappers dropped their demands late last night (Thursday) on condition that they are not arrested or brought to justice after freeing the hostage,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>But authorities were demanding that the kidnappers release the diplomat unconditionally, said the official, speaking by telephone from Marib.</p>
<p>The diplomat was kidnapped in Sanaa on Monday by members of the al-Toaiman tribe and is being held in Marib, 170 km (100 miles) northeast of Sanaa.</p>
<p>A Yemeni official said on Thursday members of other tribes mediating on behalf of the government had asked for more time due to the &quot;positive progress&quot; which prompted authorities to extend indefinitely a Wednesday night deadline to attack the captors if they did not free the diplomat.</p>
<p>The Toaiman tribe is seeking government compensation for losses inflicted on homes, farms, water pumps and wells by floods that killed 65 people in June. It also wants more job opportunities and the settlement of a land dispute.</p>
<p>French embassy officials have refused to give details on the diplomat, who Yemeni authorities say is a first secretary at the embassy.</p>
<p>In recent years, tribes in Yemen with grievances against the government or foreign oil firms have kidnapped tourists or foreigners for use as bargaining chips.</p>
<p>At least two diplomats, an American and a Saudi ambassador, have been among the kidnap victims.</p>
<p>The tribes' demands have usually involved land or water issues, and have rarely been political. There have been no reported casualties from the abductions.</p>
