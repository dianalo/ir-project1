<p>Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp said Monday it has appointed Jack Bovender Jr as president and chief operating officer, to succeed David Vandewater, who resigned last week during a federal investigation of Medicare fraud by the giant hospital chain.</p>
<p>The appointment follows a tumultuous week during which Columbia/HCA's chairman, Richard Scott, also resigned and three mid-level executives were indicted on fraud charges.</p>
<p>Bovender, 51, a former chief operating officer of Hospital Corp of America, will take up the new post immediately, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bovender retired as the chief operating officer of HCA in 1994 when it was acquired by Columbia, the company added.</p>
<p>&quot;I am committed to operating this company in a manner that promotes the highest moral and ethical standards,&quot; Bovender said. &quot;This means creating and supporting an environment in which integrity, honesty, and trust are the hallmarks of the way we do business.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, he said Columbia/HCA's management team would cooperate with the federal government and state governments to resolve &quot;past issues concerning the operating practices&quot; of the company.</p>
