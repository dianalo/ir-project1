<p>President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defence Secretary William Cohen will fan out across Eastern and Central Europe after next week's NATO summit in Madrid to explain U.S. policy on expansion of the alliance, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. leaders, who back expanding the alliance in Madrid to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, are expected to overcome resistance from France and some other members to also invite Romania and Slovenia to join.</p>
<p>Washington wants them, and other potential candidates, to wait for a second wave of expansion.</p>
<p>The president, who will travel to Madrid on Monday after a vacation in the Spanish island of Mallorca, will go on to Poland on Thursday and to Romania on Friday morning before leaving the same day for a state visit to Denmark.</p>
<p>He is due to leave there for Washington late on Saturday evening, White House officials said.</p>
<p>Cohen and Albright will also attend the Madrid summit.</p>
<p>Officials said Albright would travel to Warsaw and Bucharest with Clinton and then to Ljubljana, where she will stay on Friday night, to brief Slovene leaders on the NATO summit and stress U.S. support for democratic reforms there.</p>
<p>She will go to St Petersburg on Saturday to meet Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, on Sunday to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius to meet the presidents of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and later that day travels to Prague.</p>
<p>Albright, who was born in Czechoslovakia and moved to the United States with her parents after the Second World War when the communists took over, leaves for Washington on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Cohen will travel from Madrid late on Wednesday to Budapest, where on Thursday he will meet Hungarian officials and visit U.S. troops stationed at Taszar as part of the NATO-led Bosnia peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>On Fiday he will fly to Lviv in Ukraine to attend military peacekeeping exercises to include local, Russian and U.S. troops before flying on to Kiev, where he plans to meet President Leonid Kuchma and other officials on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Sunday he will fly to Sofia for meetings planned with Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov and other officials and leaves for Washington on Monday.</p>
