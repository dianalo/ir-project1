<p>Vodafone Group Plc, Britain's biggest mobile telephone company, will on Monday unveil a new corporate identity which will include getting rid of most of its 12 separate brands and introducing a unified billing system.</p>
<p>It is also expected to bring its six Vodafone service provider chains, which sell phones and hook customers up to the company's network, under one umbrella, cutting costs and giving the company a stronger brand identity.</p>
<p>In an effort to kick-start sluggish growth and secure its position as market leader amid increasing competition among its three rivals, Vodafone said last month it planned a complete rethink of its distribution strategy.</p>
<p>The company said on Friday it would detail plans next week to restructure its distribution business and a new retail concept featuring a new look for its 300 British high street stores.</p>
<p>Vodafone has a confusing number of outlets that sell its telephones, including Vodac, Vodacall, Vodacom Talkland, Peoplesphone and Astec. This does not help brand recognition.</p>
<p>Pressure to cut tariffs further is also mounting as Orange, Britain's youngest mobile operator, has rolled out its network and One2One, the smallest cellular company, will also soon have a national network.</p>
<p>Despite recent moves to cut prices -- which have left tariffs at the bottom end of the market almost a third lower than in April -- they remain more than 30 percent higher than in the high penetration high growth countries in Europe, according to Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>Chief executive Chris Gent has said Vodafone may cut prices in the summer or autumn to entice new customers onto mobile telephones. He believes that penetration in Britain will start accelerating against once it reaches 15 percent.</p>
<p>Mobile penetration is currently stuck around 13 percent in Britain, compared to around five percent in France, 7.5 percent in Germany and the Netherlands and a hefty 29 percent in Sweden.</p>
<p>The company expects Scandinavian levels of penetration of 30-40 percent in around 10 years but disputes some analysts' suggestions that tariffs have a lot further to fall before that level is achievable.</p>
<p>Vodafone, which won 53,000 net new subscribers in the second quarter of the year -- the fewest new customers of the four mobile operators -- expects to connect a net 350,000 to 400,000 this year.</p>
<p>This is slightly lower than last year amid tough competition for new subscribers from rivals Cellnet, 60-percent owned by British Telecommunications Plc, and the two purely digital operators Orange Plc and One2One, jointly-owned by Cable and Wireless Plc and U S West.</p>
