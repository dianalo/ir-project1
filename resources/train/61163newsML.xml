<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine tax-hike bill approved by lower house.</title>
<headline>Argentine tax-hike bill approved by lower house.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-09-18</dateline>

<p>Argentina's lower house of Congress on Wednesday passed Economy Minister Roque Fernandez's tax-hike package, which now goes to the Senate for a final vote next week.</p>
<p>Only ruling Peronist Party legislators voted in favor of the bill, which rises gasoline taxes by 12 percent.</p>
<p>The two main opposition forces, the Radical Party and the center-left Frepaso coalition, as well as several other smaller, provincial parties, opposed the move. But Peronists managed to approve it because they have a majority in the lower house.  </p>
<p>Still, even staunch Peronist allies, including the right-wing Democratic Center Union, voted against the set of measures aimed at narrowing a fiscal gap that Fernandez has warned could rise to $6.6 billion this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Has this package not been approved, we would have been in deep trouble,&quot; Peronist deputy Eduardo Barrionuevo said.</p>
<p>It took Peronists nearly two hours to garner quorum to discuss the bill. After the vote, deputies started debating article by article and planned to hold a vote on each. But after the overall approval no major changes were expected.  </p>
<p>This was the second attempt at passing the bill, after 14 Peronist congressmen and all the opposition failed to show up in Congress last Wednesday and the session was called off for lack of quorum, dealing an embarrassing blow to President Carlos Menem's administration.</p>
<p>Today, opposition congressmen only agreed to join the session after Peronists managed to form quorum of their own.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are seeking here is giving the executive (branch) a tool to alleviate the fiscal deficit,&quot; Peronist Deputy Erman Gonzalez told reporters.  </p>
<p>On top of a 12 percent rise in gasoline taxes, the package also includes a 10 percent rise on diesel vehicles, a 28.6 percent increase in levies on natural gas and an increase in income tax for companies to 33 percent from 30 percent.</p>
<p>The lower house was also due to vote later this evening on a separate bill, already approved by the Senate, making fuel tax rises non-shareable with provinces, thereby allowing the central government to keep all the extra revenue to help it narrow its fiscal gap.</p>
