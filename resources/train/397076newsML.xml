<p>Applied Magnetic Corp said Monday that it has proposed a merger with Read-Rite Corp.</p>
<p>Under the proposed terms of the deal, Read-Rite shareholders would receive 0.679 common shares (corrects from 679) of Applied Magnetics for each Read-Rite share.</p>
<p>Based on the closing price of Apllied Magnetics on Feb 21, the exchange ratio would produce a value of $37.50 for each Read-Rite share, said Applied Magnetic.  </p>
<p>Applied said that it would proceed with a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Read-Rite's current board of directors with a new board that would, subject to their financial duties, endorse the transaction.</p>
<p>The combination of the two companies, said Applied, would result in a supplier of disk heads with $1.8 billion sales per year, and an equity market capitalization of of $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Applied also said that cost savings, manufacturing efficiencies and revenue enhancements from the combination would provide incremental gains in pretax earnings of more than $100 million in the 12 months following the transaction.  </p>
<p>The total value of the deal, according to an Applied Magnetic spokesman, is $1.76 billion. Read-Rite has about 47 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Speaking of the merger, the Applied Magnetic spokesman said, &quot;Our intention is to have it friendly.&quot; But he added that &quot;We have been trying to do this for nine months and they have said no.&quot;</p>
<p>Representatives from Read-Rite were not immediately available for comment.</p>
