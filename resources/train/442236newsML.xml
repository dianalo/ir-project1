<p>Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said on Friday his country's support for Hungary's efforts to join the European Union was undimmed but EU enlargement could not take place without adequate internal reform.</p>
<p>&quot;On Hungary's accession ot the European Union Austria's standpoint is unchanged,&quot; Klima told a joint news conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn. &quot;But internal reforms of the EU structure must be completed satisfactorily first.&quot;</p>
<p>The Austrian government, under pressure from farmers and other residents of the Bergenland region bordering Hungary seemed late last year to have cooled a little in their support for Hungarian membership.</p>
<p>The Bergenlanders expressed concerm that Hungary's EU membership would unleash of an influx of cheap labour and goods, particularly food products which they saw as undercutting their own agriculture.</p>
<p>Klima said negotiations with all applicant countries should start in six months when the Inter-Governmental Conference has completed its review of the Union's internal workings but added discussions should examine each applicant's economy, sector by sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Union must look in each case how far each sector has come in satisfying the necessary criteria,&quot; he said, adding that Hungary was well placed in most fields.</p>
<p>&quot;Hungary has met with enormous success in its economic and political progress towards meeting European norms,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Horn, who last December appealed to the EU not to open simultaneous talks with all EU appicants but to start with those most ready to join, said he now accepted that all EU applicants would be invited to begin talks at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;It is natural that all talks begin at the same time but when they are completed must depend on the circumstances for each country,&quot; he said, adding that Hungary would surely be one of the first to be seen as satisfying EU entry criteria.</p>
<p>The two government leaders also discussed ways of improving crossing points at their common border -- the EU's eastern frontier -- in time for Austria's full compliance with the EU's Schengen agreement, which aims at loosening internal EU borders but strengthening external frontiers.</p>
<p>Vienna and Brussels have agreed on October 27 as the target date for the full application of the Schengen rules to Austria's borders.</p>
