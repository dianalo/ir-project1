<title>UK: Brent spreads soften with outright levels, APIs.</title>
<headline>Brent spreads soften with outright levels, APIs.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-05-15</dateline>

<p>Trade on physical North Sea crude markets was stumped by the fall in outright levels following bearish U.S. stock figures from the American Petroleum Institute, traders said.</p>
<p>Only paper and CFD action was seen over the morning and, as often happens in a falling market, trade was light.</p>
<p>Intermonth spreads on Brent lost ground sharply with June/July trading earlier at +10 cents and offered recently at +8 cents with the best bid three cents lower.</p>
<p>June Brent on the IPE futures market lost 34 cents to trade at 1148 GMT at $19.28 a barrel.</p>
<p>API statistics released late on Tuesday showed a staggering 6.9 million barrel rise in U.S. crude stocks with gasoline up 6.5 million barrels.</p>
<p>CFD's also fell sharply with next week's 19-23 dates at July -14/-10 cents and May 27-30 at July -16/-13 cents.</p>
<p>Oseberg production in June will be hit sharply by scheduled field maintenance.</p>
<p>Traders were somewhat surprised at the June programme which showed the equivalent of 30.7 standard 500,000 barrel cargoes next month against 44.2 in May.</p>
<p>Despite this lighter than expected programme traders said weak fundamentals should drag North Sea crude differentials down in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>A light first decade June Forties and/or Brent programme would help hold differentials in the short term, they added. Those two programmes were expected to be released early on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean Urals demand was healthy with the grade assessed in the dated Brent -$1.10/-$1.00 a barrel range.</p>
<p>Traders grew more concerned over Iraqi Kirkuk exports following the recent rise in crude prices.  </p>
<p>One trader familiar with Kirkuk crude said &quot;at these prices there would be difficulties (in loading the full scheduled May volumes).&quot;</p>
<p>Although there were no reports of cargo cancellations or volume reduction as yet, traders said they would not be surprised if volumes were reduced on late May loadings.</p>
<p>Currently the last cargo in May is due to load on May 24-25. No further cargoes would be loading until June 8 at the earliest, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like taking 400,000 barrels per day out of the market,&quot; one trader said, adding that although it was expected it did mean the downside on Urals differentials would be limited over the coming weeks.</p>
