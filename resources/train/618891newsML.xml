<p>Turkey's central bank governor Gazi Ercel said wholesale inflation rate for end-1997 was expected to stand at around 80 percent this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our studies on the wholesale inflation shows that the end-year inflation this year will be above the target of 70 percent,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the liberal daily Yeni Yuzyil on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be 78 to 79 percent, or even slightly higher than 80 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government's year-on-year wholesale inflation target was 57.5 percent for 1997, but Ercel had previously said the bank was basing its plans on a 70-percent inflation rate expectation for 1997.</p>
<p>Ercel said slow progress in privatisation, lack of an accord with the International Monetary Fund and failure to realise some planed revenues would keep inflation higher.</p>
<p>Turkey's year-on-year wholesale inflation rate was 72.8 percent in April, compared to 84.9 percent at end-1996.</p>
<p>Turkey is working on a medium-term stability plan to lower the hyperinflation rate to below 10 percent over three years.</p>
<p>&quot;We have said the (70-percent) rate could be achieved if the government succeeds in four areas -- an accord with the IMF (International Monetary Fund), speedy privatisations, external and domestic borrowing and keeping primary budget surplus at 1996 levels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we see that only in the area of borrowing we do not have problems, but the other areas have not seen any improvements,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has become clearer that the primary budget surplus for 1997 will be less than its level last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turkey's primary budget surplus, excluding interest payments, was 279,661 trillion lira at end-1996, compared to the budget deficit of 1,217 trillion lira for last year.</p>
