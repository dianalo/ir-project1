<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss toughen stance on Iran after German verdict.</title>
<headline>Swiss toughen stance on Iran after German verdict.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-04-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Switzerland said on Wednesday it would take a harder line with Iran but still maintain ties after a German court ruled that Tehran ordered the 1992 murders of four Kurdish activists.</p>
<p>It recommended Swiss organisers cancel a planned seminar next month on investment in Iran and suspended consideration of opening a human rights dialogue with the Islamic government, the Berne foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said it would decide only later whether to keep its envoy to Iran at home for more consultations when the ambasador returns from a trip to the United States later this month.</p>
<p>&quot;The Berlin verdict in the so-called Mykonos trial has shown that a case of state terrorism was proven,&quot; triggering consequences far beyond bilateral ties between Iran and Germany, the ministry statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Federal Council (cabinet) is thus strengthening is already very critical stance on Iran while maintaining ties.&quot;</p>
<p>It ruled out opening human rights talks with Iran &quot;because the conditions for a constructive human rights dialogue are not seen as being fulfilled&quot;.</p>
<p>Berne advised the Swiss Trade Promotion Bureau to scrap its Iran investment seminar on May 5 that Swiss federal trade officials had been set to attend.</p>
<p>Neutral Switzerland has represented U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran since the U.S. embassy in Tehran was seized by Iranian students in 1980.</p>
<p>Iran -- fighting U.S. sanctions and keen to preserve links with Europe -- has repeatedly denied any role in the Berlin killings, which it blames on fighting between opposition groups.</p>
<p>European Union member states, except Greece, said they would recall ambassadors for consultations and Iran said it would reciprocate. But both Bonn and Tehran indicated they did not want a total diplomatic break.</p>
<p>EU states have resisted U.S. pressure for sanctions on Iran, which Washington accuses of sponsoring terrorism. Tehran denies the charges.</p>
