<headline>U.S. mortgage-backeds slip in lethargic trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. mortage-backeds dipped into negative territory in thin, directional trade on the heels of a stronger-than-expected rise in a closely watched measure of manufacturing activity, market sources said.</p>
<p>Treasuries cleared the path for pass-throughs in light profit-taking around midday, following the release of the November National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) report, traders said.</p>
<p>The November NAPM index rose to 52.7, sharply higher than a 50.8 figure forecast by market experts in a Reuters poll. The October index was pegged at 50.2.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was some buying earlier in the day in Fannie Mae 7.0 (percent) and 7.5 (percent) coupons,&quot; said one New York-based trader.</p>
<p>He said yield spreads to Treasuries were modestly tighter earlier in the day, but have softened up since midday.</p>
<p>No major bid lists were cited, market players said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been an extremely quiet day,&quot; added one regional trader.</p>
<p>By late afternoon Monday, pass-throughs were 2/32 to 4/32 lower in current coupons and discounts.  </p>
<p>Specifically, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.0 percent coupons were down 3/32 at 99-11/32, yielding 107 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.</p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac paper was off 3/32 as well, at 99-04/32 and 99-11/32, respectively.</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury note was also off 3/32 at 103-07/32 to yield 6.06 percent.</p>
