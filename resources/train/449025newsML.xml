<p>The prices of U.S. government securities closed steady on Tuesday as investors awaited consumer price data and ahead of next week's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond spiked upward to 7.0 percent following the release of stronger-than-expected housing data early in the session. February housing starts jumped 12.2 percent to a 1.528 million annual rate, higher than an expected 1.45 million annual rate.</p>
<p>The Treasury long bond closed 2/32 lower at 95-25/32 to yield 6.96 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market traded in a very narrow range today after initially being hurt by housing starts. But that number was later dismissed as being unimportant because of the weather effect,&quot; said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp.</p>
<p>For now, market attention had shifted to consumer price data due for release Wednesday and next week's meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers, Sohn said.</p>
<p>With market participants about evenly split on whether the Fed would vote to tighten monetary policy first at its March or May meeting, narrow range trade was to be expected in coming days, Sohn said.  </p>
<p>Sohn was in the camp that held policymakers would not act next week, but wait for its May meeting when more statistics would be available to justify a tightening.</p>
<p>&quot;First of all the market has heeded the chairman's warning and interest rates have gone up. The inflation picture is so good they'd like some sort of proof positive before pulling the interest rate trigger,&quot; Sohn said.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a terribly slow day with not much to react to. At this point we're just marking time until CPI is released tomorrow,&quot; said Anthony Karadakis, economist at the First National Bank of Chicago.  </p>
<p>At this point there appeared to be a slightly better than 50 percent chance that the Fed would raise rates at its meeting next week, Karadakis said, adding that it was a tenuous forecast at best.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy remains exceptionally strong. We're looking at first quarter growth in a 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent range,&quot; Karadakis said. &quot;At some point they have to become frustrated that the economy won't slow down on its own.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was scheduled to speak Wednesday and Thursday before Congress, although it was not expected that he would tip the FOMC's hand.  </p>
<p>Sally Kleinman, economist at Chase Securities Inc., noted that last week's producer price data moved the market because they were shockingly low. But most of the surprise in PPI came from capital goods, which play a negligible role in CPI.</p>
<p>Kleinman noted that PPI measures goods inflation while CPI adds services, where inflation is running more than two percentage points faster year-on-year than it is for goods.</p>
<p>Thus, she said, CPI was not expected to repeat the exceptional performance seen by PPI. Nonetheless, she saw CPI rising by only 0.2 percent.  </p>
<p>The Treasury said Tuesday it would keep the size of its three- and six-month bills auctions flat at $23 billion.</p>
<p>At the short end of the maturity range, three-month bills closed unchanged at 5.14 percent; six-month bills were up one basis point at 5.27 percent and year-bill rates ended down one basis point at 5.44 percent.</p>
<p>Two-year notes ended unchanged at 99-13/32, yielding 6.20 percent. Five-year notes closed down 1/32 at 98-23/32, yielding 6.56 percent. Ten-year notes fell 1/32 to 96-20/32, yielding 6.72 percent.</p>
