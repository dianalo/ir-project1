<p>Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim, standing trial for match-fixing, seemed to have it all -- he moved in exclusive circles, counted top soccer players among his friends and had money to burn at casinos.</p>
<p>But during his testimony in court on Tuesday it gradually transpired that he had huge gambling losses, had been dropped by his main benefactor and was sometimes mocked by a soccer player he considered a very good friend.</p>
<p>Lim denies paying goalkeepers Bruce Grobbelaar and Hans Segers to fix matches on behalf of a Far Eastern betting syndicate, but admits he paid the two for inside information which he passed on to a major gambler in Indonesia.</p>
<p>He said the gambler -- cocoa commodity trader Johannes Josef -- regularly paid large sums of cash for information and predictions which would help him make money betting on foreign matches while in Jakarta.</p>
<p>The prosecution says Lim and former striker John Fashanu used the money from Josef and other sources to pay Segers and Grobbelaar to fix matches. The four men deny the charges.</p>
<p>Lim said Josef was his main benefactor for many years but stopped sending money in 1994 when he learned his protege had lost 175,000 pounds ($280,600) betting at casinos with guests and business contacts.</p>
<p>&quot;He said it was very easy to become hooked on casino games. I felt he failed to see the importance of me going to casinos with friends and guests,&quot; said Lim. &quot;I had winning streaks and losing streaks but in the long run I lost. He also knew that.&quot;</p>
<p>Lim, who was known to his friends in England as Richard, often ran out of money in casinos and had to call Fashanu for help, knowing he kept large cash sums at home.</p>
<p>&quot;If luck was running in the wrong direction, you would have to call from which ever casino or club you were at and ask to borrow money,&quot; said Fashanu lawyer Trevor Burke.</p>
<p>&quot;Many, many times,&quot; acknowledged Lim, who described Fashanu as a &quot;very very close friend&quot; he relied on to predict the outcome of top-level matches.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd ask him for advice a lot of times, sometimes pestering him,&quot; said Lim, from Malaysia's ethnic Chinese community.</p>
<p>&quot;And he'd stab a guess at it to shut you up,&quot; snapped Burke. &quot;Yes,&quot; Lim laughed nervously.</p>
<p>Fashanu later introduced him to Grobbelaar and immediately suggested the goalkeeper help predict matches.</p>
<p>&quot;Rich, why don't you try Bruce? He would be very good. My workload would be halved,&quot; Lim quoted Fashanu as saying. The soccer player also used to mock his new friend.</p>
<p>&quot;Early on, Fashanu would poke fun at you for being Chinese but having a name like Richard, didn't he?&quot; asked Burke.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, he used to ask why I wasn't called Mike. He would call me Richie Rich or Mikey Mike,&quot; Lim replied .</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure it sounded funnier then than it does now,&quot; Burke said coldly, prompting laughter in the court.</p>
<p>Prosecutor David Calvert Smith is due to cross-examine Lim on Wednesday and is likely to probe his links with Grobbelaar, alleged to have received 40,000 pounds for fixing one match.</p>
<p>After the four defendants were arrested in March 1995 Lim did not see either keeper until they appeared in court in October that year.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not speak to Grobbelaar. I had no reason to speak to him,&quot; said Lim.</p>
<p>&quot;Had he not become your friend?&quot; Lim's lawyer Jerome Lynch asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, he was a very good friend,&quot; Lim said, pausing a few seconds before continuing. &quot;Fashanu was updating me on the welfare of Grobbelaar, which I was very concerned about.&quot; REUTER ($1=.6237 Pound)</p>
