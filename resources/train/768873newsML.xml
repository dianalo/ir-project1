<title>HUNGARY: Hungary Forex Club may launch one-year BUBOR rate.</title>
<headline>Hungary Forex Club may launch one-year BUBOR rate.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-07-31</dateline>

<p>The Hungarian Forex Club (MFT) is considering the introduction of a twelve-month Budapest Interbank Offered Rate, the MFT said on Thursday.</p>
<p>MFT launched the one-month and the three-month BUBOR rates on August 1, 1996, and added the six-month rate in May as six-month loans on the interbank market became liquid enough, MFT officials told a news conference.</p>
<p>The BUBOR rates are calculated by the National Bank of Hungary daily from the average quotes of eight banks.</p>
<p>The maturity for which Hungarian banks deal with each other on the interbank market have been lengthening in the past year as the central banks' monetary policies made financial market processes more calculable, they added.</p>
<p>The MFT is considering launching a one-year BUBOR rate as one-year loans have appeared on the interbank market.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already seen offers for one year on the money market and they did not move in a very wide range,&quot; said Geza Egyed, chairman of MFT's BUBOR committee.</p>
<p>However, he added it would probably take more than a few months for one-year money market deals to become liquid enough to make the introduction of one-year BUBOR rates reasonable.</p>
<p>MFT operative committee chairman Judit Teschler said that a BUBOR rate for less than one-month maturity may also be introduced.</p>
<p>She added that the banks quoting BUBOR rates undertook to do deals for minimum 100 million forints at the bids and offers they quote, but the Club was also considering raising the minimum amount by 100-400 million forints.</p>
<p>Egyed said BUBOR futures turnover on the Budapest Stock Exchange has totalled 118 billion forints since September when the bourse launched the instrument.</p>
<p>The BUBOR has become the basis of Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs), which also appeared in September on Hungary's interbank market and their total turnover has reached 50 to 60 billion forints so far, Egyed said.</p>
<p>Hungary's BUBOR rates did not change on Thursday. The one-month rate was fixed at 20.50 percent, the three-month rate at 20.11 percent and the six-month BUBOR at 19.74 percent.</p>
