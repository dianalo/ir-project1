<p>Uighur exiles protested in the Turkish capital on Friday against the killing of their ethnic kin during a riot in northwest China amid reports of continuing disturbances in the Chinese Xinjiang region.</p>
<p>Several hundred people gathered after Moslem Friday prayers outside Ankara's main Kocatepe mosque where they chanted anti-China slogans and burned a Chinese flag, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The crowd held a Moslem mourning ceremony for those who died in the two-day riot last week. According to Chinese officials, nine people died and nearly 200 were wounded in clashes.</p>
<p>Leaders of a nationalist Uighur group in Kazakhstan said on Friday that riots in Xinjian were continuing despite Beijing's statement that disturbances had been quelled. The group said 80 to 90 people died between February 5 and 10.</p>
<p>&quot;We are telling the world about the massacre and condemning the Chinese government,&quot; Hayrullah Efendigil, one of the protest organisers in Turkey, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Many of the protesters were brought on buses from Istanbul and the central Turkish town of Kayseri. Activists say there are around 20,000 ethnically Turkic people from Xinjiang in Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not Xinjiang, it is eastern Turkestan,&quot; one protest banner said of the mainly Moslem region where Turkic Uighurs are in the majority, compared with 38 percent ethnic Han Chinese.</p>
<p>Later, a black wreath with the inscription &quot;Get out of Turkestan&quot; was laid in front of the Chinese embassy.</p>
