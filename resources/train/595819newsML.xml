<title>USA: Scores wait on line overnight for Staples trial.</title>
<headline>Scores wait on line overnight for Staples trial.</headline>

<p>More than 70 people were in line to enter a Federal courtroom Monday for the government's court challenge to the $4 billion merger of Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;I began waiting in line at noon on Sunday,&quot; said Navi Chhabra.</p>
<p>Chhabra and others -- all of them paid to stand in line and hold places for others -- waited through the night outside the building. They were allowed in when the building opened at 7 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>The individuals would not say who they were standing in line for, but lawyers said many were holding places for stock traders who hold large share positions and stand to gain or lose from favourable or unfavourable developments during the court session.</p>
<p>Standing in line for others is common for tax hearings and other important matters on Capitol Hill, but it is unusual at the courthouse.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time I can remember something like this at the courthouse,&quot; said Paul Clark, who stood near the line. Clark hired many of the place holders.</p>
<p>The hearing before Judge Thomas Hogan was expected to take five days. Hogan has said he will rule on the challenge by the Federal Trade Commission in June.</p>
