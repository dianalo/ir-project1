<headline>U.S. wants Karadzic on trial in Hague.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-08-13</dateline>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday insisted the United States wants Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic tried for war crimes by an international tribunal at The Hague.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the policy of the United States to make sure that Mr. Karadzic goes to The Hague. That is where we believe war criminals belong,&quot; she told reporters.</p>
<p>She was reacting to reports in the London press that Biljana Plavsic, embattled president of the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, had said that Karadzic had turned down a U.S. offer of refuge in a third country.</p>
<p>Albright, answering questions during a picture-taking session with the Chilean foreign minister, did not specifically deny the Financial Times report that Plavsic had been the conduit for a U.S. proposal for Karadzic.</p>
<p>But she said: &quot;I hope that Mrs. Plavsic remembers the terms of the Dayton accords better than she remembers our conversation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The statute of limitations on war criminals does not run out and Mr. Karadzic's day will come,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Later, deputy State Department spokesman James Foley told a news briefing: &quot;She (Albright) did not make such an offer&quot; as Plavsic suggested.</p>
<p>Under the 1995 U.S.-brokered Dayton accords, the parties involved in the Bosnia war ended their military conflict and agreed to a detailed plan that was supposed to bring peace to a unified Bosnia.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the accords was that indicted war criminals like Karadzic would be brought to justice. So far, the United States and its allies have been unable to compel cooperation, especially by Bosnian Serbs and Serbia, and this is a major failure of the peace effort.</p>
<p>The Financial Times reported that Plavsic said in an interview on Monday that the proposal for Karadzic to go to a third country had been put to her by Albright during a meeting in Banja Luka, Bosnia on June 2.</p>
<p>&quot;She said that within two weeks they expected me to tell the media that Radovan Karadzic had left Republika Srpska and that I did not know where he was,&quot; the newspaper quoted Plavsic as saying.</p>
<p>Plavsic said she relayed the offer to Karadzic at his headquarters at Pale, near Sarajevo, but was rebuffed.</p>
