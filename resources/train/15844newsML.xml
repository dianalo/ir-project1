<p>Michael Chang is playing in his 10th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever, but the 24-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day.</p>
<p>Chang, seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras, took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked Jaime Oncins of Brazil 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6, 8-6 in the tiebreaker.</p>
<p>&quot;I was pretty tight the whole match,&quot; conceded Chang, one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone has moments when they get tight. Hopefully, this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament.&quot;</p>
<p>Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington, the 11th seed, who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami 6-4 2-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-1.</p>
<p>Washington's win was not comfortable, either.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami.</p>
<p>&quot;Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi,&quot; said Washington. &quot;Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate.&quot;</p>
<p>Chang and Washington were the only men's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women's players fall.</p>
<p>Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany, the sixth seed, was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match.</p>
<p>Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory.</p>
<p>Last year's Wimbledon junior champion, Aleksandra Olsza of Poland, removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-4 6-2.</p>
<p>Other men's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round.</p>
<p>Germany's Michael Stich, the 1991 Wimbledon champion, and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5, and Belgian Kris Goossens 6-2 6-0 7-6 (7-1), respectively.</p>
<p>Alex O'Brien, who scored his first professional title eight days ago in New Haven, advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over Ecuador's Nicolas Lapentti.</p>
<p>Wimbledon bad boy Jeff Tarango caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German Alex Radulescu due to heat exhaustion. Tarango was leading 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 6-1 3-1.</p>
<p>Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins, who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</p>
<p>Chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors, though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian, who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults.</p>
<p>The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set, leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker.</p>
<p>The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous, which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net. First Chang approached the umpire, then Oncins, then Chang again before play finally resumed.</p>
<p>&quot;Those little seconds were like an hour to me,&quot; said Oncins, who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance.</p>
<p>Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins, the contest was a personal victory.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992. The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo. He died slumped against Oncins, who subsequently lost interest in tennis.</p>
<p>&quot;Two months ago I started talking about quitting,&quot; said Oncins, who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe in my game again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced.</p>
<p>Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee, and 1988 Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull, organisers said.</p>
<p>Women's ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist.</p>
