<p>SUGAR: World market for February 26, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London ended mixed with nearby positions holding at or near their day's peaks on steady New York raws. But movements on both spreads and premiums remained tight before New York's March raws expiry. Spot May finished just 10 cents up at $306.20 a tonne after a high of $306.50. Earlier trade and broker selling drove the spot contract down to a low of $304. May/August hovered between premium and discount as May weakened in a continued technical reaction to last week's strength.</p>
<p>Raw sugar futures in New York settled near the day's highs, buoyed by late-session speculative buying and interest from Far Eastern dealers in the March/May spread, floor sources said. The most active May contract closed 0.06 cents higher at 10.89 cents, having ranged from 10.75 to 10.91 cents. The spot March contract settled up 0.10 cents to 10.90 cents. Traders said the market will turn its attention from the spread to the May contract, pegging nearby resistance at just over today's high, at 10.92 cents. Support was seen at 10.72 cents in May.</p>
