<p>U.S. Diagnostic Inc questioned Bear Stearns' stated reason for dropping its buy rating on U.S. Diagnostic, charging that the action was the result of a Bear Stearns &quot;vendetta&quot; for U.S. Diagnostic hiring Smith Barney last week as lead manager of future U.S. Diagnostic security offerings.</p>
<p>U.S. Diagnostics challenged a Bear Stearns charge that a &quot;member of the management team&quot; at U.S. Diagnostics was convicted for fraud and conspiracy.  </p>
<p>Early Monday, Bear Stearns analysts A.J. Rice and Tom Gallucci said in a research note that they ceased tracking the company upon learning that Keith Greenberg, who they believed to be a &quot;co-founder of (U.S. Diagnostic) and a member of the management team&quot; had pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in 1994.</p>
<p>U.S. Diagnostic president Joseph Paul, in an interview with Reuters, confirmed that Greenberg had a criminal record. But Paul said Greenberg was only a consultant, not a co-founder, and had never been a company officer or director.  </p>
<p>U.S. Diagnostic shares closed Monday down 2-11/16 at 9-3/8, after rebounding from an earlier freefall to 7-7/8.</p>
<p>Rice and Gallucci said in the note, &quot;We have learned information regarding the prior experiences and background of a individual associated with U.S. Diagnostics Inc that causes us to lose confidence in our ability to assess ongoing developments at the company.</p>
<p>&quot;This individual ... has, over the last year, been introduced to us and described in written material published by the company as a co-founder of USDL and a member of the management team...&quot;  </p>
<p>Their research note said Greenberg had pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in 1994 to charges of fraud and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Paul told Reuters it was true Greenberg had been convicted in 1994, but he said Greenberg was an outside consultant on acqusitions who has never been an officer or director.</p>
<p>Paul added that all U.S. Diagnostic's public filings are &quot;correct in all material aspects.&quot;</p>
<p>Paul said Greenberg, while not a co-founder, was among several people who had received founding shares in U.S. Diagnostic after the company was created in 1993.  </p>
<p>&quot;I started the company in June 1993, and some of my founding shares were given to several people for helping me. He was one of them because he worked for the firm that fiananced our first bridge loan,&quot; Paul said.</p>
<p>Paul said U.S. Diagnostic in the third year of a five-year contract with Greenberg's consulting company, under which Greenberg is compensated for any acqusitions he proposes that are consummated by U.S. Diagnostics.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Greenberg) was always an outside consultant,&quot; Paul added.</p>
<p>Paul charged that Bear Stearns' Rice &quot;chose to pick out some information without looking at the issue ... because we signed a letter of engagement with Smith Barney and not them.&quot;</p>
<p>A Bear Stearns response was not immediately available and calls to the analysts for comment were not returned.</p>
