<headline>ASDA shares active after research figures.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-23</dateline>

<p>Shares in ASDA Group Plc led food retailers lower in a rising equity market on Thursday as figures showed a drop in ASDA's market share and a drop in sterling encouraged switching into international stocks, dealers said.</p>
<p>Figures from market research group AGB showed a dip in ASDA's market share, though analysts and dealers said the decline could be a one-off and the AGB report was not seen as having a significant market impact overall.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen a big swing-round in sectors,&quot; said one senior trader, &quot;some that have underperformed because of the currency have perked up while domestics have weakened.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares in ASDA were down 2-1/2p at 123-1/2 by 1035 GMT in volume of 8.6 million shares, making it the second most active stock in the UK market.</p>
<p>J Sainsbury Plc was down 1-1/2p at 385-1/2, Safeway Plc was down 5-1/2p at 405 and Tesco Plc was down 4-1/2p at 365-1/2.  </p>
<p>In the latest of its regular monthly surveys of supermarket market share, AGB said ASDA had slipped to 13 percent in the four weeks to January 12 from 13.2 percent in its previous survey covering the four weeks to December 15.</p>
<p>Sainsbury -- which issues a Christmas trading statement on Friday -- saw its market share rise to 20.1 percent from 19.4 percent, AGB said, while Tesco -- which on Monday said Christmas sales rose 7.5 percent -- was flat at 23.2 percent.</p>
<p>Safeway's market share rose to 10.9 percent from 10.4 percent.</p>
