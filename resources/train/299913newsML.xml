<title>UK: S&amp;P rates Endesa Chile planned notes.</title>
<headline>S&amp;P rates Endesa Chile planned notes.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-10</dateline>

<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said on Friday it assigned its A minus foreign currency rating to Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. Chile's (Endesa) planned senior unsecured notes in three different issues of varied terms and maturities, totalling $580 million.</p>
<p>The proceeds of the notes will be used to finance investments in Chile and the recent acquisition in Colombia, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said in a statement that the foreign currency outlook for Endesa was stable.</p>
<p>It said most investments being undertaken were expected to strengthen Endesa's business position over the medium term.</p>
<p>The recent acquisition in Colombia, although raising the proportion of non-Chilean assets and revenues, was a profitable venture in an investment-grade country with a supportive regulatory framework.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, Endesa's higher leverage will further weaken the degree of protection afforded to bondholders, but to levels that are expected to be largely commensurate with Endesa's foreign currency rating,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said it was closely monitoring developments and would evaluate the impact of further investments and acquisitions.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said Endesa's ratings reflected its strong operating profile and its dominant market position in Chile's electricity sector, which benefits from a supportive regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Also, investments in other countries were contributing to profitability and cash flow. Nevertheless, financial performance weakened in 1996 and is anticipated to weaken further over the next three years. Available cash flow is constrained by a high dividend policy, sizable capital expenditures in Chile, and further regional diversification.</p>
<p>Endesa, Chile's largest electric utility, accounts for 48 percent of the country's generating capacity and 63 percent of transmission assets. Outside Chile, it operates two generating facilities in Argentina.</p>
