<p>Britain's new Labour government promised on Wednesday to lead the fight against global warming in the countdown to an international summit to be held in Japan this December.</p>
<p>&quot;We will take the hard decisions necessary to put the UK truly at the forefront in tackling climate change,&quot; said Environment Minister Michael Meacher. &quot;This government will take the lead in the fight against global warming.&quot;</p>
<p>Meacher, in office for just a month, made his comments at a conference on the climate crisis organised by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).</p>
<p>The international community will meet in the Japanese city of Kyoto at the end of the year aiming to agree on targets for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide which warm the atmosphere and are widely blamed for changing the climate.</p>
<p>But talks are stymied by disputes between industrial countries which produce most of the gases, developing nations fearful of being held back in their industrial development, and the small islands most at risk from the higher sea level which global warming is expected to produce.</p>
<p>WWF says climate change is the single greatest threat to species and habitats worldwide and is urging governments to reduce emissions by 20 percent by 2005.</p>
<p>The European Union has agreed in principle to a cut of 15 percent by 2010 but has so far enacted measures that would only bring about a 10 percent cut. Meacher said Britain was pushing for a 20 percent reduction by 2010 but would not blaze a trail if others refused to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not in the business of picking up the tab for everyone else and we are not offering more for others to do less,&quot; Meacher said.</p>
<p>Farhana Yamin, a specialist in environmental law, said leading EU members had a key role to play. &quot;If Germany and the UK can strike a deal between them, they can take others in the EU along with them and that, in turn, would influence others,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>But countries with most to lose from temperature rises fear Kyoto could deliver little but rhetoric.</p>
<p>Atolls such as the Maldives and Tuvalu will become inundated and uninhabitable if the status quo continues, while major population displacements will occur from Tonga to Micronesia, said Neroni Slade, chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States.</p>
<p>&quot;Extensive and very difficult negotiations lie ahead,&quot; he said. &quot;At this stage, there is no obvious reason for excessive optimism.&quot;</p>
