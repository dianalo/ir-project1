<p>As many as 31,000 people die each year in Indonesia from the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), the Jakarta Post on Tuesday quoted a research report as saying.</p>
<p>The research figure was nearly 500 times that estimated by the government,</p>
<p>The report by the University of Indonesia's Centre for Health Research put the country's annual AIDS death toll at between 12,000 and 31,000 people. It said the figures differed widely from government estimates because the latter comprise only reported cases.</p>
<p>The real figures are far higher because Indonesia does not have an effective monitoring system, the newspaper quoted Meiwita Iskandar, the director of the centre, as saying.</p>
<p>At the end of September, the government said 449 people had the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that leads to AIDS or had AIDS itself. Of these, 66 had died, it said.</p>
<p>Government officials could not immediately be reached on Tuesday for comment on the research report.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation has said as many as 50,000 people in Indonesia may have HIV, but that the virus is only detected when it develops into AIDS.</p>
<p>The term AIDS applies to the most advanced stages of HIV infection. HIV kills or impairs cells of the immune system, destroying the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers.</p>
