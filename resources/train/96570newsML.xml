<p>Defence Secretary William Perry on Friday ordered a protective force of 5,000 U.S. soldiers into Bosnia from Germany, to begin moving within days, the Army said.</p>
<p>It said in a release from Heidelberg, Germany, that the troops would go in by road and equipment would leave Germany by rail from Schweinfurt to cover the withdrawal of 15,000 U.S. military peacekeepers.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials said Perry signed the order on Thursday night and it was quickly transmitted to Germany by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>The Pentagon announced earlier that a cover force would be assigned and some troops would remain in Bosnia until mid-March. But Perry told hostile Republican senators at a hearing on Thursday that the 5,000 soldiers were not the planned vanguard of a new international force in Bosnia.</p>
<p>Army officials in Germany told Reuters the troops were expected to begin moving early next week and would meet their equipment at a staging ground in Hungary for the final trip into Bosnia.</p>
<p>Unlike the initial rapid U.S. troop movements into Bosnia last December, administrative officers will go in first, followed by combat troops, Army officials said.</p>
<p>The military convoys of troops will cross the Sava river into Bosnia over existing and pontoon bridges.</p>
<p>&quot;The covering force will deploy with approximately 30 M-1A1 tanks, 100 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and 40 helicopters. Its combat capability is essential to insure that the withdrawal of currently-deployed U.S. assets is done safely and without interference,&quot; the U.S. Army release from Heidelberg said.</p>
<p>Perry told Congress on Thursday that President Bill Clinton was not misleading Americans on Bosnia, saying Clinton had made no decision yet on sending U.S. troops there next year as part of any new international peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>But he also told the Senate Armed Services Committee that &quot;the international interest in Bosnia has not ended,&quot; and he left open the possibility that U.S. forces could be part of a possible new NATO-led peacekeeping force in 1997.</p>
<p>On Friday Perry told reporters at a brief joint Pentagon news conference with visiting German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe that some published reports on Thursday's hearing were incorrect in saying the United States planned to have as many as 7,500 soldiers remain in Bosnia as late as mid-March.</p>
<p>He said the plan was to have only about 7,000 remain at the end of January, followed by a rapid reduction to about 3,000 by March 1, with none left by mid-March.</p>
