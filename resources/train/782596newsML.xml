<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - UK's FTSE 100 index of leading shares hit a new milestone as solid corporate results and a weaker pound drew buyers back into stocks, even as the Bank of England contemplated an interest rate hike. The FTSE 100 closed at 5026.2, up 65.6 points, or 1.32 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares posted modest gains, as fears that the Bundesbank is poised to hike German interest rates in the near future ebbed. The DAX-30 index closed at 4335.39, up 32.71 points, or 0.76 percent. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4364.25, up 38.39 points, or 0.89 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed 1.78 percent higher after German data showed a bigger jobless rise than expected. The CAC-40 index closed at 3037.09, up 52.99 points, or 1.78 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares closed firmer after another roller-coaster session with an intra-day high in the SMI index of 5,822.3 points and a low of 5,732.3, dealers said. The Swiss market index closed at 5812.1, up 46.9 points, or 0.81 percent.</p>
<p>MILAN - Italian stocks surged in late trading, boosted by gains on Wall Street, and led higher by Fib bourse index futures with the September contract posting a closing gain of 4.39 percent to 22,840 after a peak at 22,850. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 14691, up 367 points, or 2.56 percent.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Dutch shares ended with strong gains, helped by advances at heavyweights ABN AMRO, ING, Royal Dutch and KLM, outweighing a fall at Hoogovens. The AEX index closed at 992.89, up 13.30 points, or 1.36 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks rebounded and broke a three-session losing streak, lifted by bargain hunting in the banking sector and investor interest in certain semiconductor-related issues, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 19702.07, up 187.62 points, or 0.96 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 170.08 points, or 1.04 percent, to a record close of 16,541.60 on renewed interest in property stocks and record-breaking turnover, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 16541.60, up 170.08 points, or 1.04 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian stock market closed after steady gains throughout Wednesday to end at its intra-day high, helped by the strong start to the corporate reporting season and renewed buying in resource stocks. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2727.1, up 19.5 points, or 0.72 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Strong foreign and local buying, spurred by hopes of a cut soon in South Africa's interest rates lifted industrial shares to new highs in heavy turnover trade.
