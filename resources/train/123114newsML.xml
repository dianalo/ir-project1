<p>President Boris Yeltsin sacked security chief Alexander Lebed on Thursday in a bid to end a worsening Kremlin power struggle but his dramatic move left question marks over the fragile peace in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, awaiting heart surgery next month, declared in a rare television appearance that he had had enough of what he termed Lebed's lack of team spirit and naked ambition to succeed him as president.</p>
<p>&quot;I can no longer tolerate this situation and I am forced to relieve General Lebed of his position as secretary of the Security Council,&quot; said the 65-year-old Yeltsin, who looked stiff but spoke with emotion.</p>
<p>Lebed, 46, a straight-talking retired paratroop general who enjoys strong backing among the armed forces and is seen by many as the most trustworthy politician in Russia, called on his supporters to stay calm.</p>
<p>But he predicted that an acute shortage of funding for the armed forces would provoke a &quot;hot autumn&quot;.</p>
<p>In the breakaway region of Chechnya, where Lebed helped negotiate a peace deal last August after 21-months of conflict, a senior Chechen official said his departure could lead to tragic consequences.</p>
<p>News of Yeltsin's dismissal of the charismatic Lebed jolted world financial markets but Western leaders sought to react calmly.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said there was no need to over-dramatise its significance and the U.S. state department saw the move as an internal Russian matter.</p>
<p>Lebed has been drawn into an increasingly bitter power struggle with hardline Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and other Kremlin officials since Yeltsin said on September 5 he was preparing to undergo heart surgery.</p>
<p>The final straw for Yeltsin appeared to have been a public slanging match on Wednesday between Lebed and Kulikov, just one day after the Russian leader told his Kremlin team to stop squabbling.</p>
<p>Kulikov -- who accused his rival of preparing to use force to seize power -- is one of the fiercest opponents of the August 31 peace deal which Lebed signed with separatist Chechen leaders.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the peace process would continue but the rebels were in more pessimistic mood.</p>
<p>&quot;The dismissal of Lebed will have tragic consequences for Russia,&quot; self-styled rebel foreign minister Ruslan Chimayev told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Lebed was catapulted into the Kremlin by Yeltsin last June after his third place showing in the first round of the presidential election made him kingmaker. His allegiance in the second round helped Yeltsin secure a second term.</p>
<p>Around 11 million people voted for Lebed in the first round. He enjoys huge support among the armed forces and will have done himself no harm with his latest comments on funding shortfalls.</p>
<p>&quot;We are heading for a very hot autumn, no doubt about it,&quot; he said, citing a letter from a group of General Staff officers in which they told the Defence Ministry to pay all salary arrears by October 25 or face the consequences.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this (crisis) will start on October 25, as can be seen from the letter,&quot; Lebed said. Chernomyrdin earlier appealed to the military to stay calm.</p>
<p>Lebed's lack of guile meant he soon started making enemies after being brought into the Kremlin to head Russia's powerful Security Council.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's communist opponents were quick to gloat over the sacking, saying they had pointed out from the start that Yeltsin had promoted Lebed in a cynical move intended only to clinch electoral victory over communist contender Gennady Zyuganov.</p>
<p>&quot;The Moor has done his duty, let him go,&quot; said Communist Party secretary Viktor Zorkaltsev, quoting from Shakespeare's play Othello.</p>
<p>Before the sacking, Zyuganov said the row &quot;could end in a general civil war as well as destroying the army.&quot;</p>
<p>From the start it was clear that Lebed, with a professional soldier's background,  was ill-versed in the subtle art of political infighting.</p>
<p>In August he held a news conference to demand Yeltsin choose between him and Kulikov, but the Russian leader merely told him to shut up and knuckle down.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be a united team; the team should pull together, work like a fist,&quot; Yeltsin said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;But now we have a situation whereby Lebed is splitting the team apart and is carrying out a number of moves which he did not agree with the president. This is totally unacceptable.&quot;</p>
<p>Authorities in Moscow and other Russian cities have stepped up security after the allegations by Kulikov, who also said 1,500 Chechen gunmen would help Lebed seize power. Lebed has dismissed the charge.</p>
