<p>A British town council has banned professional boxing on its premises as a health risk, a move derided on Friday as &quot;nonsensical&quot; by an opposition councillor.</p>
<p>Councillors in Bury, Greater Manchester, voted 23-19 on Thursday to ban professional boxing in the town's leisure facilities although amateur bouts will continue to be allowed.</p>
<p>&quot;There is evidence that continual heading of a football causes damage and we don't ban that on our premises,&quot; said deputy council leader John Byrne. &quot;We don't ban smoking and drinking either. In fact, we sell cigarettes and alcohol.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a completely nonsensical decision,&quot; added Byrne, who said Bury subsidised an amateur boxing club. &quot;It was totally inconsistent.&quot;</p>
<p>Council leader Derek Boden said medical evidence that boxing produced permanent brain damage swayed the vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have responsibility and we're trying to act in a responsible way,&quot; said Boden. &quot;Our leisure facilities exist to promote health and well-being. We don't see how we can do that if we allow professional boxing.&quot;</p>
<p>Bury, home of British flyweight champion Ady Lewis, imposed a temporary moratorium on professional bouts after the 1995 death of Scottish boxer James Murray.</p>
<p>Murray died of a brain haemorrhage after a British bantamweight title fight against Drew Docherty in Glasgow at which fans rioted.</p>
<p>The British Boxing Board of Control said it would seek legal advice whether the ban could be challenged.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very surprised that they would pick on the professional side of the sport and not the amateur side when it's the same sport,&quot; said BBBC spokesman Rob Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought that in the not too distant future, Mr Lewis would like to defend his title in front of a home audience.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems very unfair to Ady Lewis and to the youth of Bury,&quot; said Smith. He said he knew of at least one council which had imposed a ban but then revoked it when challenged by a promoter.</p>
