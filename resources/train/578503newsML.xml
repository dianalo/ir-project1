<p>NWE oil products were steady on Tuesday, traders said, although fuel oil slipped in value.</p>
<p>Gas oil prices were steady with stable barge and cargo premiums countering slightly softer benchmark gas oil futures. Barge offers were around June IPE +$2/+$2.50 fob Rotterdam. Bids were notionally pegged around screen flat to June +$1 a tonne.</p>
<p>Gasoline was firm on NYMEX unleaded gains. Eurograde barges traded between $201 and $202.50. Naphtha was extremely weak in the near-term, but traders were looking for better June demand.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges lost $1 to trade at $84/$85 amid scepticism over the durability of crude's rise.</p>
<p>Cargoes were quiet, with few trading while refinery margins are so bad.</p>
