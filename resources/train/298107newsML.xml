<p>China's industrial output rose by 13.1 percent to 1.9062 trillion yuan in 1996 compared with the previous year, the State Statistical Bureau said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Industrial output in the first quarter was up by a year-on-year 13.6 percent, in the second quarter by 13.1 percent, in the third quarter by 11.8 percent and by 15.7 percent in the last quarter, the bureau said.</p>
<p>One of the outstanding features of 1996 was that non-state enterprises continued to show rapid growth, the bureau said.</p>
<p>State-owned enterprises and those with a majority state stake showed year-on-year growth of 6.7 percent to 1.1042 trillion yuan. That accounted for 27.3 percent of newly increased industrial output compared with 38.6 percent in 1995, it said.  </p>
<p>Output of collective industry rose by 17.7 percent while output of private industry rose by 13.1 percent, it said.</p>
<p>Output of light industry rose by 13.5 percent, just 0.8 percentage points faster than heavy industry, which increased by 12.7 percent. That compared with 1994 when light industry output growth oustripped heavy industry by 3.1 percentage points and 1995 when it exceeded heavy industry by 4.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>In 1996, production of primary energy products reached 1.26 billion tonnes, up by 6.4 percent compared with the previous year, it said.</p>
<p>The ratio of sales to production in 1996 was 95.86 percent, and improved throughout the year, it said. The increase in sales showed that enterprises were increasingly able to reflect the market.</p>
<p>Industry encountered several outstanding problems in 1996, including a large number of enterprises facing increasing difficulties in production, delays in payments of debts and stockpiles showed little decrease. Losses were serious, the bureau said.  </p>
<p>The production growth of state enterprises was comparatively slow and the economic efficiency remained very low, it said.</p>
<p>For 1997, the bureau said it was necessary to further speed up structural adjustment and push actively toward establishment of modern enterprises, a veiled reference to introduction of shareholding systems.</p>
<p>The bureau also urged concrete measures to ease the economic difficulties at a micro-level to boost efficiency and raise quality. It did not elaborate.</p>
