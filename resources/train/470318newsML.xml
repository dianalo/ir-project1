<p>Federal investigators are examining links between Centennial Technologies Inc and a wealthy Massachusetts businessman under investigation for alleged tax evasion, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors are interested in the connections between Robert Lockwood, reportedly the subject of a grand jury investigation, and Emmanual Pinez, fired last month as chief executive of Centennial, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>According to the March 12 grand jury indictment, Pinez allegedly booked phony sales, including at least $2 million worth to BBC Computers of Merrimack, N.H., which is controlled by Lockwood, to make the company's results look better, the Globe reported.</p>
<p>John Falvey, the federal prosecutor handling the Centennial case, told the Globe that the investigation is continuing and &quot;down the road, more will become clear,&quot; about the relationship between Lockwood and Pinez. He declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Pinez has been held without bail since his arrest last month. He has denied through his lawyer any wrongdoing.</p>
