<text>
<p>-- TECHNICAL DETERIORATE IN MAY COUNTERS -- is a trend</p>
<p>analysis of the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index for the period January 13 to January 17 by analyst Mehmood Khan at Times Guaranty Financials Ltd</p>
<p>								 -----oOo-----</p>
<p>Though the trading for the week ended on a buoyant note, with a gain of 154.32 points (4.73 percent) at 3418.32 levels over the previous week, majority of the pivotal tracked after Friday's closing, depicts that the rise has been on declining volume. The technicals in a majority of the counters have deteriorated. Among the charts with bearish features the technicals of Arvind Mills, Ashok Leyland, BSES, BHEL, Glaxo, Grasim, IDBI, ITC, MTNL, Nestle and SBI appears right for bearishness to be triggered.</p>
<p>The relative strength of the counter is bearish. The real weakness in the current trend can be discerned by studying the volume action, the volume has been consistently falling even though the price continued to rally. This is a clear indication in the weakness of the uptrend. The OBV (on balance volume), which helps in the assessment of accumulation and distribution of counter has turned bearish. The bearish OBV suggests that distribution rather accumulation is taking place. Distribution would obviously lead to lower prices.</p>
<p>The interim rally from 2713.12, has retraced the decline of a larger degree from 4131.22 by 50 percent (3422.17). The critical resistance lies at 3471.25-3493.08. The cycle theory depicts the rally is extended and the correction can set in any time. The mechanical oscillators in conjunction with the volume justify that the top may be formed in the near future.</p>
<p>The price following oscillators on the weekly bar chart are exhibiting that the top may be formed at 3470-3510 levels - Relative Strength Index (14 RSI) is 56.27, Price Rate of Change (12 ROC) is placed at 8.16, short term stochastic is hovering at 94.13 and its trigger line is at 74.54, while the medium term stochastic is 54.67 and the trigger is 41.17, the Macd is -87.38 and its trigger is -116.31 &amp; the 14 William's percent R is placed at -3.46.</p>
<p>For the current week, the BSE Sensex in the upmove may encounter resistance at 3471, 3493 &amp; 3510 levels, on the lower end it may find support at 3370 and 3305. The National Index may witness profit booking at 1523-1549 level and support at 1481 &amp; 1439 level.</p>
