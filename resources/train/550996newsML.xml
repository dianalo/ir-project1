<p>French chemical and pharmaceuticals group Rhone-Poulenc SA made a big share gain on Wednesday after the company stuck to a profit forecast despite a product recall by a subsidiary.</p>
<p>Rhone, the seventh largest chemicals and pharmaceutical group in the world, reported a 6.5 percent rise in first quarter net income for the three months to March 30.</p>
<p>It said the rise would have been 30 percent but for the recall of blood plasma products by the Centeon LCC joint-venture in the United States between 68-percent owned Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Germany's Hoechst.</p>
<p>The figures were in line with expectations but the market welcomed the fact that the company was clinging to its forecast of a 20 percent 1997 profit increase.</p>
<p>Rhone shares closed 4.47 percent higher at 196.30, making it the biggest gainer after Havas with a volume of 435 million francs.</p>
<p>Net income rose to 674 million francs ($115.9 million) from 633 million on 2.2 percent higher sales at 21.6 billion francs.</p>
<p>Chairman and chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou said that new products were fuelling earnings, which made him confident of the company's profit aim despite Centeon.</p>
<p>&quot;The new products launched in the life sciences businesses are contributing more and more significantly to the group's results,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This is why we are maintaining our objective of increasing earnings per share in 1997 by 20 percent, excluding exceptional items, an objective which is becoming more difficult because of the effect of Centeon,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>New products include the anti-cancer drug Taxotere, the asthma treatment Nasacor, Rilutek for the treatment of moto-neuron diseases and the vaccine Tripedia.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, vice-president for financial affairs, told Reuters Financial Television the impact of Centeon would be &quot;a pretty large one&quot; for the year but he gave no details.</p>
<p>He said the company could keep its forecast because other operations were doing better than expected. He said Taxotere and Tripedia were selling well and that the synergy benefits from the acquisition of Fisons were &quot;exceeding expectations&quot;.</p>
<p>Operating income showed an 18.8 percent rise on a comparable basis to two billion francs.</p>
<p>This reflected a big rise in pharmaceuticals and a small improvement in fibres and polymers as well as in animal health while the chemicals division showed a decline.</p>
<p>The chemicals division was affected by continued depressed titanium dioxide markets and the increased cost of some raw materials. Fibres and polymers showed an increase despite a depressed polyester market, especially in Brazil.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures were as we expected and it is good to see that they are on track to the 1997 target,&quot; said analyst Paul Satchell of Paribas in London. &quot;I had a strong buy out and I maintain that strong buy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>According to Edinburg Financial Publishers, financial analysts are expecting a 1997 earnings per share for Rhone-Poulenc of 11.10 francs, rising to 14.20 francs in 1998. The 1996 figure was 8.44 francs.</p>
