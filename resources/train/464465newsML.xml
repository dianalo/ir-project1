<p>ALSO Holding AG, a computer services company, said it expects a significantly better result in 1997 based on higher demand for products and services and a 50 percent increase in sales in Germany.</p>
<p>ALSO, a subsidiary of Schindler Holding AG, also said in a statement issued at its annual news conference that its management expects group sales to exceed one billion Swiss francs by year 2000.</p>
<p>Last month ALSO reported that its 1996 net profit fell to 3.8 million francs from 9.2 million while sales rose to 577 million from 438 million.</p>
<p>ALSO repeated on Monday that business prospects for 1997 and future years are positive and it expects to return to previous levels of profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth prospects for the information business and the ALSO group are seen as positive,&quot; ALSO said.</p>
<p>ALSO's new subsidiary in Germany already achieved sales of over 100 million marks in its first year of business and ALSO said it would therefore accelerate its expansion strategy in this market so foreign activities also will contribute with a significant amount to ALSO's results.</p>
<p>Within the systems business, ALSO expects that many of the delayed information technology projects to be carried out and this will boost demand for its products and services.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on these prospects, the ALSO group should again achieve a significantly better results in the current year,&quot; the company said.</p>
