<p>- Money allocated to refugees from Chechnya in the 1997 budget would be enough to meet the needs of just three percent of those officially registered as having been forced to leave their homes in the rebel republic during the 1994-96 conflict.</p>
<p>- Senators in the upper chamber of the Russian parliament throw down the gauntlet to President Boris Yeltsin, overriding his veto on a bill asserting Moscow's ownership of art seized from Germany at the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>- Russia's top state officers who have made fortunes from their positions in the state hierachy are smart enough to dodge the trap set for them by the widely-advertised decree on corruption due to be signed shortly.</p>
<p>- Russian banks in charge of budget payments are stable enough to land on their feet once state money is withdrawn from their coffers.</p>
<p>- A Russian-Finnish-German joint-venture has announced it will start producing Opel Astra cars in Russsia shortly.</p>
<p>- Russian shares surge to new highs as dealers try to make good the time lost over May holidays.</p>
