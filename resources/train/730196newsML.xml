<headline>UK Labour MP questions Treasury committee line-up.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Labour member of Britain's parliament on Tuesday criticised the composition of the key Treasury Select Committee.</p>
<p>Diane Abbott, MP for the inner-London borough of Hackney and a member of the Treasury committee for eight years until parliament was dissolved prior to May 1 elections, said the new Labour government did not want dissenting voices on the committee.</p>
<p>&quot;My crime was to have independent thoughts on economic policy. So I was axed,&quot; Abbott told BBC radio.</p>
<p>She said her long-standing opposition to Bank of England independence irritated members of the government. So did her profound scepticism over a single European currency.</p>
<p>Abbott has been moved to serve on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.</p>
<p>She said the Treasury Select Committee was the most important in the House of Commons, more so now with its mandate to oversee the newly independent Bank of England.</p>
<p>The committee is charged with questioning government ministers, Bank of England officials and others with their handling of economic and monetary policy.</p>
<p>One of its first tasks will be to scrutinise Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's first budget and the new monetary arrangements whereby the Bank of England is free to set interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;They've now got a committee where five of the people are brand new. It doesn't make sense for a committee with a new and very important role of having oversight of the Bank of England, to be full of new people,&quot; Abbott said.</p>
<p>She said her opposition to central bank independence had been proved correct by the two interest rate rises the new monetary policy committee has imposed, in June and July.</p>
<p>A Bank of England spokesman said Bank Governor Eddie George will go before the committee on Wednesday, July 30. Brown will also be called to testify soon.</p>
<p>Seven Labour MPs, four Conservatives and a Liberal Democrat will form the Treasury Committee in the new British parliament.</p>
<p>They are Liz Blackman (Labour), Malcolm Bruce (Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman), Charles Clarke (Labour), Tony Colman (Labour), Jim Cousins (Labour), Quentin Davies (Conservative), Ruth Kelly (Labour, former deputy head of the Inflation Report Division of the Bank of England), Sir Peter Lloyd (Conservative), Giles Radice (Labour), Brian Sedgemore (Labour), Sir Michael Spicer (Conservative) and Sir Teddy Taylor (Conservative).</p>
<p>Blackman, Clarke, Colman, Cousins and Kelly are all newly-elected members of parliament.</p>
<p>Radice, who is expected to be named chairman of the committee, told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that the new members' lack of experience was not a problem. &quot;We have got some good people on the committee,&quot; he said.</p>
