<p>The foreign ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) tasked with helping to bring peace to Cambodia were expecting to get further direction on Tuesday from strongman Hun Sen for their mission, Philippines Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said.</p>
<p>Asked at a news briefing when he expected to receive a reply from Hun Sen, Cambodia's second prime minister, Siazon said: &quot;Maybe today, if the fax machine works.&quot;</p>
<p>ASEAN has been waiting for clarification on whether Cambodia welcomes the regional group's mediation help in the crisis that began when Hun Sen's forces ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in early July.</p>
<p>Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot, who had been attending ASEAN's 30th anniversary meetings here as an observer, told the group last week that Cambodia wanted ASEAN's assistance in brokering a settlement.</p>
<p>But ASEAN has sought &quot;reconfirmation&quot; from Hun Sen that such efforts would be welcome after hearing conflicting signals from Phnom Penh last week about the role of the foreign ministers from the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Siazon said he was unable to say when the three foreign ministers would make another trip to see Hun Sen. &quot;That depends on Phnom Penh,&quot; he said, when asked.</p>
<p>But he said the mediation group would consist of the same envoys.</p>
<p>&quot;(Indonesian) Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was co-chair of (Cambodia's) Paris (Peace Accord), and Ali is the one who really knows all the characters... I'm the chair of the (ASEAN) Standing Committee, and Thailand is our (member) most seriously affected immediately on anything (involving Cambodia),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It is wrapping up week-long meetings held in Malaysia's capital.</p>
