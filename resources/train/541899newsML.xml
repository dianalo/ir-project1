<p>Three people were hurt, one of them seriously, in overnight street clashes in two Northern Ireland towns, British security sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>One of two men who received head injuries in fighting between Protestants and Catholics in Portadown was described as &quot;serious but stable&quot; in a Belfast hospital.</p>
<p>A boy of 13 was receiving hospital treatment for a wound near his eye that people in Lurgan said had been caused by a plastic bullet fired by a British soldier.</p>
<p>Police said patrolling troops had been attacked by a crowd throwing stones and other missiles.</p>
<p>Police restored order in neighbouring Portadown after a clash between pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics. The town was the scene of bitter sectarian strife last year that spread to other areas.</p>
<p>Tension has risen in the British province in recent months because of violence by Irish Republican Army guerrillas, and the onset of a period of Protestant marches which Catholics say inflame sectarian passions.</p>
<p>Police said on Sunday that they had issued an order banning a march by the Protestant Orange Order scheduled later in the day from entering a Catholic stronghold.</p>
<p>The Orange Order supports rule from London, which is opposed by Catholics who want Northern Ireland merged with neighbouring Ireland.</p>
