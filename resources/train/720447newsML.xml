<title>USA: Women are newest targets of financial services marketers.</title>
<headline>Women are newest targets of financial services marketers.</headline>

<p>In another era, women were ignored by financial pros who focused their sales pitches on the men of the house.</p>
<p>But a newly awaked investment community has discovered that women control substantial amounts of wealth, and are targeting women investors big time with new sales pitches and products. Before they are done, we women may end up longing for the bad old days when we weren't shown much respect but at least we were left alone.</p>
<p>Brokers, financial planners, and insurance and mutual fund salespeople are focusing on the fact that women react differently than men to tried and true sales techniques. Traditionally, these marketers have focused on men because men controlled more money than women and because men were quicker to act on financial advice while women asked more questions.</p>
<p>Now, however, divorce, widowhood, and economic realities have put more women in charge of more money for themselves. Brokers have discovered that women clients take longer to cultivate, but, as one advisor noted in a recent interview, &quot;when they start investing, they get excited, and boy, do they bring in their friends!&quot;</p>
<p>As a result, Oppenheimer mutual funds, with President Bridget Macaskill, has gone into marketing to women in a big way, with surveys, seminars and the like. Other mutual fund companies and brokerages often release women-focused surveys.</p>
<p>The National Centre for Women and Retirement Research at Long Island University has been studying women's invesment behaviours and beliefs for corporate clients.</p>
<p>New York publishers are rushing to press with investment newsletters aimed exclusively at women and their financial concerns. AAL Capital Management, the mutual fund arm of the Aid Association for Lutherans, has been training its sales force with tips such as don't wear too much cologne or offer weak, finger-tip handshakes.</p>
<p>Guys, we aren't all that inscrutible. Women, like men, worry that they won't have enough money for retirement or their kids' tuition bills. Like men, women don't want to get ripped off, and like men, women want investments that offer nice returns without undue risks.</p>
<p>Unlike men, women live longer, tend to have lower pension assets because they interrupt careers to raise children or work in jobs with poor benefits, and (particularly if they are older) may have been socialized to think investing is unfeminine, asking questions is stupid, and risks are not for them. Also unlike men, women tend to approach financial advisors with the aim of forming a long term relationship with someone they trust.</p>
<p>As such, women are vulnerable to hooking up with the wrong investment advisor, concedes Christopher Hayes, director of the National Centre at Long Island University.</p>
<p>How can women who want to invest capitalise on all the new attention without spending too much time talking to salespeople and writing commission checks?  Do that other thing that women do best. Ask a LOT of questions. About commissions, fees, prices, risks, rewards and competitive products. Don't buy until you understand all the answers.</p>
