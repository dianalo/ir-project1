<headline>Arabs close ranks over Turkish plans for Iraq.</headline>

<p>Turkey's plan to set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq has brought Arab states together in support of Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>Even those Arab governments which joined the military campaign to drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 1991 say they cannot accept a foreign buffer zone in an Arab country.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a pillar of Arab opposition to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during the Kuwaiti crisis, said in remarks published on Monday that partitioning Iraq or annexing Iraqi territory would be grave.</p>
<p>&quot;Iraq is an Arab state the survival and unity of which we are intent on preserving,&quot; he told the ruling party newspaper Mayo. &quot;Partitioning Iraq would create a dangerous situation in the whole region,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But after Mubarak called Turkish President Suelyman Demirel on Monday, Egypt said it had Turkish assurances that it would not set up a military presence in Iraqi territory.</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said Turkey would explain its thinking to the Iraqi ambassador. &quot;In a few days we will invite all the Arab world's representatives and inform them of the reasons for Turkey's requirements,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Syria, Algeria and the six Gulf Cooperation Council states have expressed reservations about the buffer zone, which Ankara says would stop Turkish Kurds from using the area as a base for attacks on Turkish forces.</p>
<p>A notable exception is Jordan, which has refrained from overt criticism of the plan and has been developing ties with Turkey, apparently as a bulwark against Syria.</p>
<p>Arab opposition reflects suspicion about Turkish policy in the region, especially in the light of the defence cooperation agreement which Turkey and Israel signed this year.</p>
<p>It also shows that pan-Arab solidarity and resentment of non-Arab interference in the region can transcend the antagonism between Saddam and his fellow Arab leaders.</p>
<p>Arab leaders can argue that just as they rallied in support of Kuwaiti sovereignty in 1990, they should similarly defend Iraqi sovereignty now against Turkish encroachments.</p>
<p>Diplomats say Arab governments are increasingly concerned that countries like Israel, Turkey and the United States are deciding the future of the region without consulting them and to the long-term detriment of the Arabs as a single nation.</p>
<p>The same thinking lies behind Arab opposition to secessionist movements in southern Sudan, even among governments which have no love for the Islamist government in Khartoum.</p>
<p>By similar logic the Arab League has consistently and unequivocally demanded that Iran withdraw from three Gulf islands claimed by the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a sense of siege, of being in retreat, of being squeezed on every front. This buffer zone plan clearly reinforces that Arab perception,&quot; one Cairo diplomat said.</p>
<p>Arabs, especially Islamists and traditional Arab nationalists, note that the United Nations, under U.S. influence, has imposed sanctions on three Arab countries -- Iraq, Libya and Sudan. They wonder which country will be next.</p>
<p>Syria, which has a longstanding territorial dispute with Turkey, has been especially vehement about Turkish plans for northern Iraq, seen in Damascus as an encircling tactic.</p>
<p>Turkey says the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the target of the buffer zone plan, has bases in Syria and in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon.</p>
<p>The Syrian ruling-party newspaper al-Baath said: &quot;Insisting on this (setting up the zone) would no doubt have negative results on future Arab-Turkish ties because Arabs would be forced to take the needed decision to protect their rights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any violation of the unity of Iraqi territory is a threat to the pan-Arab security and all Arabs,&quot; added the Syrian government newspaper Tishreen.</p>
