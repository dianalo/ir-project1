<p>The Chinese yuan continued to fall on Thursday, closing at a one-month low of 8.2962 from Wednesday's 8.2955 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai, with more selling emerging at the 8.2950 level, dealers said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Wednesday was 8.2950.</p>
<p>The yuan opened higher at 8.2950 and consolidated around the opening level early in the trading, hitting an intraday high of 8.2947. It then fell to the 8.2960 level, hitting a low of 8.2967.</p>
<p>Trade was dull early and active late in the session with most transactions done at about 8.2957, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;More selling emerged at the 8.2950 level after it failed to stand firm above that,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>A second dealer said that although central bank intervention was not very clear in the Thursday session, it has played a key role in the market. &quot;Recent falls have been triggered by worries about central bank intervention,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the yuan to move around 8.2960 on Friday.</p>
<p>The yuan closed down at 6.8245 from 6.7905 against 100 Japanese yen and down at an intraday low of 1.0722 from 1.0718 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
