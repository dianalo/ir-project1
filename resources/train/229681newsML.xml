<title>UK: Pillar to redevelop City of London site.</title>

<p>Pillar Property Investments Plc launched plans on Monday for a major new office development in London's City financial district, provided that it can find tenants in advance.</p>
<p>Pillar will replace Sudbury House in the northwest corner of Paternoster Square near St Paul's Cathedral with a new building of nearly 300,000 square feet designed to meet demand for floor spaces big enough to take financial trading rooms.</p>
<p>Some banks have complained recently that there is a lack of new space in the City which can meet their need for single floor areas of 10,000 to 15,000 square feet to take trading rooms.  </p>
<p>The company said in a statement it has conditionally agreed to buy the leasehold on Sudbury House from Magnox Electric Plc and the new development will be backed by U.S. fund the General Electric Pension Trust.</p>
<p>The freehold is owned by the Church of England but planning permission has already been granted and Pillar said the project, which will be renamed Christ Church Court, will now go ahead &quot;if a substantial pre-letting is achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our conditional purchase of Sudbury House fits well with Pillar's strategy to increase our exposure to the improving City market without exceeding our self-imposed limits of speculative development,&quot; said Pillar's chairman Raymond Mould.</p>
<p>&quot;We view Christ Church Court as an outstanding opportunity to meet the large floor plate, large new building demand in the City of London and feel confident that we can provided an excellent building here to meet that requirement.&quot;</p>
<p>No financial details were disclosed but industry sources told Reuters that Pillar was understood to be paying around 35 million stg for the leasehold and the total scheme is being valued at around 150 to 160 million stg.</p>
