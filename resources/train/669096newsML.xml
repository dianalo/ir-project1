<p>Furious Argentina coach Daniel Passarella threated Tuesday to pull his team out of the Copa America soccer tournament because of a possible last minute venue change for his team's quarter-final match.</p>
<p>Passarella was outraged at an alteration that could force his team to play their quarter-final in La Paz, at 3,600 metres above sea level.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going, I'm not going,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a complete disgrace.&quot;</p>
<p>His outburst came after his team drew 1-1 with Paraguay to finish second in group A.</p>
<p>Originally, the second-placed team in the group had been due to meet the second-placed team in group B in the colonial city of Sucre, which at 2,700 metres high is only 100 metres above Cochabamba.</p>
<p>But the organisers announced Tuesday that the game would be switched to La Paz if Peru or Uruguay won group B.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll see if this is true and then we'll go back to Buenos Aires,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Passarella, who has brought a second-string team to the Copa, is already angry at the timing of the competition, which is crammed between the region's World Cup qualifying matches.</p>
<p>He also said the World Cup qualifying competition itself is too long.</p>
