<p>Peruvian rebels holding 72 hostages in Lima would fly to asylum in Cuba and take some captives with them under a broader deal to bloodlessly end the crisis entering its 98th day on Tuesday, a Japanese diplomatic source said.</p>
<p>The source, who requested anonymity, said on Monday the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) hostage-takers agreed to safe haven in Cuba and Peru agreed to allow some captives to go along on the Cubana de Aviacion asylum flight.</p>
<p>The government initially rejected that MRTA demand but later agreed to let rebels take at least eight hostages, including Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela and Japanese Ambassador Morihisha Aoki, the source added.</p>
<p>Peruvian government officials late on Monday night denied a tentative deal to peacefully end the siege at the Japanese envoy's home had been struck and a spokesman for Tokyo in Lima said reports of details of an accord are &quot;just rumours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The framework is laid for them to go to Cuba ... (but) my understanding is that there is still a substantial gap to be filled&quot; before an agreement is reached, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Both Cuba and the Dominican Republic have offered to grant the rebels asylum, if all sides agree, as a way to end the siege that began Dec. 17.</p>
<p>The reports of a partial deal came on Monday as a flurry of separate meetings between mediators, the Cuban-inspired rebels and President Alberto Fujimori sparked optimism but no tangible sign of a break in the standoff.</p>
<p>Mediator Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani told reporters after a day of crisis meetings: &quot;Holy Week, when we commemorate the death of the son of God, who speaks to us of forgiveness and reconciliation, is a very good occasion to reach a peaceful and viable solution.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, Fujimori met for two hours with Cipriani at Government Palace to discuss the siege but issued a statement saying the end of the crisis was still &quot;not in sight.&quot;</p>
<p>The two discussed stalled face-to-face talks between the government and MRTA and agreed on the need to push ahead with efforts to find a peaceful solution, &quot;although the date for the end of it was not in sight,&quot; said the statement.</p>
<p>The government and the MRTA broke off talks March 12 for a period of &quot;reflection&quot; after mutual accusations.</p>
<p>But both sides on Monday sounded upbeat that discussions may resume soon.</p>
<p>Isaac Velazco, the rebels' international spokesman, told Reuters that progress was being made in restarting talks because the government realised the only solution was to negotiate and Fujimori was under growing pressure to find a peaceful outcome.</p>
<p>&quot;The greatest achievement in the last 15 to 20 days has been the government's recognition that the only solution is through negotiation,&quot; Velazco said by telephone from Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;The government does not have much time as it liked to claim earlier,&quot; he said. &quot;It is now under a lot of pressure from abroad -- particularly from Japan.&quot;</p>
<p>A Peruvian newspaper reported on Monday the MRTA may be offered a multi-million dollar ransom, as well as asylum and release of some of its jailed comrades in return for freeing the hostages.</p>
<p>The proposal was drawn up by the three-member mediating panel and would be presented to both sides &quot;in coming days,&quot; the daily La Republica said.</p>
<p>MRTA spokesman Velazco said the offer was &quot;feasible, could be studied and lead to a solution to the crisis as long as it considers the freedom of our jailed fighters and leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>Rebel leader Nestor Cerpa made a formal proposal to the government detailing which prisoners the group wanted freed, Velazco said without elaboration.</p>
<p>Tokyo suggested this sort of behind-the-scenes work was bringing the crisis closer to a solution, despite the lack of face-to-face meetings in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation may appear deadlocked at first sight, but I am convinced that the issue is heading towards a solution,&quot; Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told reporters in Tokyo on Monday. &quot;I think the time is ripe for a peaceful settlement.&quot;</p>
