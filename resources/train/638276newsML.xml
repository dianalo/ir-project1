<p>Anti-corruption police raided one of Hong Kong's two metropolitan English-language newspapers on Wednesday and arrested six people in a fraudulent-circulation probe, an official statement said.</p>
<p>The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said those detained were four current employees of Hong Kong Standard Newspapers Ltd, and two former employees. All were being released on bail later.</p>
<p>The agency emphasised that the daily and Sunday newspapers' editorial operations were not subject of the investigation, which focused on printing, circulation, sales and marketing activities.</p>
<p>It cited allegations that up to 23,000 copies a day had been printed as surplus and sold as waste, to &quot;deceive a British-based circulation audit company and local advertising clients of both newspapers.&quot;</p>
<p>No comment was available immediately at Hong Kong Standard Newspapers, publisher of the Hong Kong Standard and the Hong Kong Sunday Standard. Calls to company secretary Kwok Siu-man and editors were not returned.</p>
<p>The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sing Tao Holdings Ltd, a major media group whose Chinese-language Sing Tao daily circulates internationally including Britain and North America.</p>
<p>The parent firm is headed by press magnate Sally Aw Sian, who succeeded her father, the &quot;Tiger Balm&quot; tycoon Aw Boon Haw died in 1954. He made a fortune frnm the popular Asian ointment.</p>
<p>The ICAC said it had uncovered a scheme involving deliberate excess print runs apparently sold to a bogus bulk distributor, but in fact a surplus sold as waste paper.</p>
<p>&quot;ICAC inquiries also indicated that more recently the deliberately printed surplus and systematic disposal has ranged from 14,000 up to 23,000 copies per day.&quot;</p>
<p>It alleged that since at least early 1994, the circulation figures of the Hong Kong Standard and Sunday Standard newspapers &quot;have been fraudulently and systematically inflated.&quot;</p>
<p>The ICAC, a graft-busting agency founded in 1974, said its officers acted on search warrants at the company's office and at the homes of some current and former staff.</p>
<p>The arrested six comprised three serving and one former senior employee and one former and one serving circulation supervisor.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's population of 6.4 million has 54 Chinese-language newspapers, about one third of them daily.</p>
<p>The major English-language dailies besides the Standard are The South China Morning Post, another metropolitan paper, and the regional-circulating Asian Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>According to estimates published by Merrill Lynch in February, South China Morning Post has a market circulation of 104,000, while Sing Tao had 73,000.</p>
<p>It did not give a figure for The Hong Kong Standard, but one media analyst said he estimated the newspaper's circulation at about 40,000.</p>
