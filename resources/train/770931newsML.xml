<p>Akzo Nobel NV reported its most profitable ever quarter on Thursday, beating market expectations with a 25 percent surge in second quarter earnings and repeating its forecast for record earnings in 1997.</p>
<p>The Dutch drugs and chemicals group said net profit rose to 459 million guilders ($222.1 million) from 367 million in the second quarter of 1996. Analysts had expected a profit of 375-427 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Second quarter earnings of consolidated and nonconsolidated companies improved significantly. Therefore Akzo Nobel stands by its forecast that net income for 1997 will be higher than in the record year 1996,&quot; the company said in its results statement.</p>
<p>Shares in the company rose 14.50 guilders or 4.8 percent to 317.00 guilders on the news in moderately active trade.</p>
<p>Akzo Nobel -- which acquired its double-barrel name after taking over Sweden's Nobel Industries in 1994 -- made a net profit of 1.318 billion guilders for the whole of 1996.</p>
<p>The company said second quarter sales rose 10 percent in cash terms to 6.2 billion guilders, mainly thanks to an eight percent increase in sales volumes.</p>
<p>Currency translations had a positive effect of five percent on sales, while average sales prices were down one percent. The net of divestments and acquisitions cut sales by two percent.</p>
<p>Second quarter operating profits at all four of Akzo Nobel's product groups were higher than in the same 1996 period.</p>
<p>Operating profits at Pharmaceuticals were boosted by higher sales for prescription drugs unit Organon, animal health unit Intervet and raw materials unit Diosynth, although product launch and R&amp;D costs were also higher.</p>
<p>The Organon business unit posted volume gains for contraceptive pills, its new antidepressant Remeron and a new fertility drug Puregon.</p>
<p>Akzo Nobel said earnings of all of its Coatings (paint) businesses improved significantly, reflecting higher sales volumes, cost-saving measures and a recovery in margins,</p>
<p>In the Chemicals division, Polymer and Surface Chemistry both enjoyed volume growth, while Catalysts began to reap the cost benefits of past investments.</p>
<p>Akzo Nobel said its man-made Fibres division was still suffering from surplus capacity around the world which was exerting strong pressure on prices.</p>
<p>Despite a range of remedial measures, operating profit still amounted to barely two percent of sales, which did not even cover financing charges, the company noted. ($ = 2.066 Dutch Guilders)</p>
