<p>Ehud Barak, Israel's former army chief and most decorated soldier, scored a landslide victory on Tuesday in internal elections for leader of the main opposition Labour party, according to exit polls.</p>
<p>The leadership vote marked an historic passing of Labour's political torch to a younger generation from former prime minister Peres, 73, and his assassinated predecessor Yitzhak Rabin, whose rival camps divided the party for nearly a quarter-century.</p>
<p>Barak, 55, who was heavily favoured, has cast himself as heir to Rabin's warrior-turned-peacemaker mantle. He stands to become only the third Labour party leader since 1973.</p>
<p>Israel Television's exit poll gave Barak 57 percent of the vote compared with 28 percent for Yossi Beilin. Channel Two's poll showed 56 percent support for Barak with 26 percent of the votes going to Beilin.</p>
<p>&quot;If these will be the real results, this is truly a good showing for (candidate) number one but also a nice showing for number two,&quot; Beilin told reporters.</p>
<p>Barak was due to speak at his own headquarters near Tel Aviv but was expected to hold off victory speeches until final results were in early on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The winner of the contest is expected to face Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in national elections scheduled for 2000. Opinion polls put Barak neck-and-neck with Netanyahu, 47, whose first year in office has been buffeted by peacemaking crises and clouded by corruption allegations.</p>
<p>About 60 percent of the 167,000 registered Labour Party members cast their ballots, Channel Two said.</p>
<p>Rabin's widow, who endorsed Barak in the Labour race, was beaming at Labour party headquarters when results of the exit polls were announced.</p>
<p>&quot;I trust him and I know he will lead the way so that the message will be clearly heard that we are heading towards peace, period. No zig-zags, no detours, no excuses,&quot; Leah Rabin told reporters.</p>
<p>Echoing Yitzhak Rabin, who spearheaded Arab-Israeli talks until an ultra-nationalist Jew gunned him down after a 1995 peace rally, Barak said Labour was &quot;committed to take calculated risks in the Middle East in order to achieve peace&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Labour party has gotten back up on its feet and a journey has begun which is perhaps long but which will in the end return us to leading the country,&quot; Barak told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Beilin, who was Barak's main competitor, is the bookish prophet of Labour peace policies and Peres's longtime protege.</p>
<p>Shlomo Ben-Ami, 53, a Moroccan-born novice politician with roots both in academia and among the disadvantaged, came third in the leadership contest with 11 percent.</p>
<p>Ephraim Sneh, 52, a physician and brigadier general before he served Rabin and Peres as health minister, received 7 percent of the vote, according to the Israel Television poll.</p>
<p>Long before entering politics, Barak was a near-legendary military figure in Israel, at one point serving as Netanyahu's commander in an elite commando unit.</p>
<p>Barak joined Labour barely two years ago after shedding his uniform. The military credentials helped catapault Barak, a self-described centrist, to prominence in a country where security remains the paramount -- if not the sole -- issue in election campaigns.</p>
<p>Barak joined Rabin's cabinet as interior minister in 1995 and succeeded Peres as foreign minister when the Labour veteran took the reins of government after Rabin's murder.</p>
<p>&quot;I congratulated Ehud on his victory and I congratulated Yossi on his results...Now we must move forward,&quot; said Peres.</p>
<p>Netanyahu edged Peres in an upset election victory in 1996, in part by characterising the Nobel peace laureate as soft on security.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish all the (Labour) candidates success and hope Labour voters pick an opposition leader who will remain such for many years,&quot; Netanyahu said earlier on Tuesday.</p>
