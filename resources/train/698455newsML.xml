<headline>Plavsic vows fight &quot;all the way&quot; to keep power.</headline>
<dateline>PALE, Bosnia 1996-07-02</dateline>

<p>Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic vowed to fight &quot;all the way&quot; to stay in power after gaining apparent army support for her condemnation of corrupt nationalist hardliners who control the government.</p>
<p>Plavsic met threats by the ruling SDS party to replace her by making a 40-minute television attack on &quot;shameful&quot; smuggling deals which she said involved former president Radovan Karadzic, an indicted war criminal, and high officials.</p>
<p>&quot;The consequence of this is an enormous accumulation of wealth by a relatively small number of our population,&quot; she said. &quot;Do they think that the rest of the population will be their slaves?&quot;</p>
<p>It was the first time that many in the Bosnian Serb republic had heard such frank criticism of Karadzic and his hardline supporters who led the 1992-95 war against Bosnia's Moslems and Croats.</p>
<p>Political sources said the broadcast might have been possible only because Plavsic had the sympathy of some officers in the army, which controls the tightly-controlled television system's transmitters.</p>
<p>The army has its own grievances against some leading SDS politicians whom it accused during the war of profiteering at the expense of badly-paid soldiers.</p>
<p>The Bosnian Serb economy remains firmly under the control of Karadzic and powerful allies who include Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of Bosnia's collective multi-ethnic presidency.</p>
<p>The conflict between Plavsic and the hardliners has simmered for months as a result of her campaign against corruption and accusations by the SDS that she was too cooperative with international peacemakers.</p>
<p>It reached a crisis at the weekend when she tried to sack Interior Minister Dragan Kijic for refusing to investigate two suspect companies in which Karadzic and Krajisnik have a stake.</p>
<p>She also confirmed the international community's suspicion that Karadzic was still in charge of the Bosnian government despite efforts to push him out of public life because of his war crimes indictment.</p>
<p>The SDS leadership met in Pale on Tuesday and said she over-stepped her constitutional prerogatives by attacking Kijac.</p>
<p>It scheduled a meeting of the Bosnian Serb parliament on Friday to remove her and it ordered her in the meantime to turn power over the Vice President Dragoljub Mirjanic.</p>
<p>Plavsic responded by telling her television audience she would &quot;go all the way&quot; in a showdown to retain the presidency.</p>
<p>According to the constitution, she cannot be removed by parliament but only by a referendum.</p>
<p>In the past, the SDS political machine always delivered Karadzic the electoral results he wanted but political sources in Pale said he appeared to have misjudged the extent of public support for Plavsic and popular anger over poverty.</p>
<p>The Bosnian Serb republic survived the war only on handouts from neighbouring Serbia and it remains visibly poorer than its former foes in Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation.</p>
