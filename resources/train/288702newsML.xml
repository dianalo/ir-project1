<p>Most U.S. refiners continued to shy away from foreign crudes Monday despite several offers from sellers trying to cash in on the open trans-Atlantic arbitrage, trade sources said.</p>
<p>The spread between bellwethers West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent for February stood around $1.80 a barrel, a level which exceeds the cost of transporting oil across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>At least three Brent cargoes for February were on offer, for February 5-10, February 18-20 and the third decade of the month. Prices range from WTI minus 25 cents for the early shipments and 35-40 cents for the later ones, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know that much (of the Brent) has been placed,&quot; one trader said. &quot;It seems that there's a surplus.&quot;</p>
<p>Weak margins have suppressed U.S. refinery demand in much of the country, traders said.</p>
<p>One trader took a contrarian view, noting that several early February Brent cargoes have already been placed around WTI minus 20-30 cents. &quot;Gulf Coast activity has picked up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Latin American cargoes are moving sluggishingly. Shell Oil is offering 550,000 barrels of Colombian Vasconia crude, loading January 20-21. Traders said Shell was originally asking March WTI minus $1.85 a barrel fob, but has since receded to $1.95-2.00 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;The cargo is a little stale,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I think it'll get snapped up in the $2.00 range.&quot;</p>
<p>In the U.S. aftermarket, a full boat of February paper Brent changed hands at $24.65 a barrel, while a series of partials totalling 500 lots traded at $24.63/24.67/24.68/24.70 a barrel.</p>
<p>London's IPE settled at a more modest $24.57 a barrel.</p>
<p>Intermonth spreads were also stronger. Feb/March Brent traded twice at 54 cents, compared to 52 cents at the IPE close.</p>
