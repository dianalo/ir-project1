<headline>LucasVarity slips on caution for div outlook.</headline>

<p>Engineering giant LucasVarity Plc saw its shares slip by 1200 GMT as analysts expressed some caution about the group's stated policy of offering investors a blend of dividend growth and share buybacks.</p>
<p>Some suggested that tough markets would make it difficult for LucasVarity to provide earnings growth. Another concern was that the dual dividend/buyback policy would dilute the dividend yield and could put off some large institutional investors.</p>
<p>The shares were down 1.0p at 199-1/2, after in-line profits and a 2.25p dividend for the year to January 31, 1997 and 4.5p dividend for the current year, plus a 3.0 percent share buyback.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sell it,&quot; said Sanjay Jha, analyst at Williams de Broe. &quot;UK fund managers held the former Lucas Industries (merged into the group last September) due to its high dividend yield. That yield has now fallen to less than three percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors interested in capital growth could believe the company was capable of moving ahead, he said. But Jha added that the company still needed to make some heavy investment in new technology, which would hinder its scope for dividend growth and further buybacks.  </p>
<p>Jha said that was why the shares had slipped from an earlier gain. He said scope for further falls in the shares was limited, however, as many investors had already bailed out earlier this year when LucasVarity first hinted at a dual policy of buybacks and reduced dividend payouts.</p>
<p>One other fear was that buybacks were not so tax efficient for UK pension funds.</p>
<p>Another analyst said earlier it was difficult to square comments about dividend growth with the difficult trading outlook. &quot;They alluded to difficult trading conditions, suggesting that operating profits and dividends are not going to storm ahead.&quot;</p>
