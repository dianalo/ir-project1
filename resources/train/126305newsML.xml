<p>Defence Secretary William Perry came to this once-top-secret Little Star submarine shipyard where Cold War ballistic missile submarines are being turned into scrap metal.</p>
<p>Perry praised the Russians' &quot;skill and hard work,&quot; which has combined with U.S. machinery to destroy submarines under the Start 1 arms treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;You can be very proud of that. We faced the danger of a nuclear holocaust that hung over our heads like a dark cloud. Now with the end of the Cold War, that cloud is drifting away,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He watched as crews with blowtorches cut up a 400-foot (122 metre) Yankee Class of Soviet submarine that had been rusting in dry dock. The submarine had once patrolled off U.S. shores, said Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who travelled with Perry to the site 100 miles (160 km) south of the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>&quot;That sub had its missiles trained on U.S. cities,&quot; Nunn said. U.S. equipment has been provided to the workers at the base to help in their efforts to scrap two submarines a year.</p>
<p>Perry's visit to the once-secret base marked the first time that foreign journalists and photographers were allowed at the site, which was a major production point for the Soviet Union's strategic ballistic missile submarines. The United States is destroying its submarines at a site in the Puget Sound in Washington state.</p>
<p>Perry, who has kept to his schedule despite the turmoil in Moscow over President Boris Yeltsin's firing on Thursday of security chief Alexander Lebed, was due back in Washington on Friday evening.</p>
