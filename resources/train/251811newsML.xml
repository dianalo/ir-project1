<p>Tajikistan protested to the United Nations on Thursday against alleged violations by Islamic rebels of a provisional truce signed on Wednesday in northern Afghanistan, a presidential spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was shooting in the town of Garm this morning when the opposition attacked our battalion,&quot; spokesman Zafar Saidov told Reuters. &quot;We are going to issue a note of protest to the U.N. special representative in Tajikistan, Gerd Merren.&quot;  </p>
<p>Tajikistan's President Imamali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri agreed on a ceasefire from midnight on Wednesday during their talks in northern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Tajik officials as saying that two soldiers of the battalion besieged by opposition rebels in Garm, 150 km (100 miles) east of the capital Dushanbe, had been killed and another three wounded during the rebel attack on Thursday.</p>
<p>Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted a Tajik foreign ministry statement as saying that if the opposition continued its attacks the government would have to respond. Tass said Merren had informed Nuri about Rakhmonov's protest.</p>
<p>Forces loyal to communist Rakhmonov defeated their opponents in a civil war in 1992 and forced them to flee to neighbouring Afghanistan. The opposition has waged a guerrilla war against Rakhmonov since then and won some territory earlier this year.</p>
