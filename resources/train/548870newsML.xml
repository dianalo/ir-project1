<p>Thailand's largest commercial lender, Bangkok Bank Plc, plans to cut its minimum lending rate by 25 basis points in the near future, executive vice-chairman Piti Sithi-Amnuai said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will have to (cut)...I think we have to fall in line,&quot; he told Reuters. The bank's MLR now stands at 13.25 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;It could be the end of the month or early next month we don't know yet... It's going to be not any more than 25 basis points,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added the bank was unlikely to cut any other rates.</p>
<p>Three major Thai banks announced 25 basis point cuts in their minimum lending rates on Monday.</p>
<p>High borrowing costs have squeezed many corporate and individual borrowers.</p>
<p>Thailand's economic managers have given a high priority to protecting the currency and the country's lending and deposit rates remain among the highest in the region despite growing evidence that the economy is continuing to slow.</p>
<p>The central bank has given indications that the time is right now for easing rates and some banks have responded with the small cuts. But some analysts say the level of cuts may be too small to help.</p>
