<p>Banco Bilbao Vizcaya reported on Thursday that first-half net profit rose 25.9 percent, as both basic banking at home and investments in Latin America performed well.</p>
<p>Net attributable profit climbed to 58.11 billion pesetas ($378.4 million) from 46.15 billion a year earlier, with strong gains registered in core bank lending and fee income and in Latin America.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in BBV results is based principally on ordinary business,&quot; Chairman Emilio Ybarra told reporters. &quot;All sources of revenue increased intensely.&quot;</p>
<p>Net interest income -- which reflects revenues from lending and the costs of interest-bearing deposits -- rose 32.6 percent to 265.44 billion pesetas.</p>
<p>Ordinary revenue, which also reflects commission and trading revenues, rose 35.8 percent to 393.19 billion pesetas. Non-recurring items contributed just eight percent to earnings, Ybarra said.</p>
<p>&quot;In Spain, the environment is developing favourably although there is pressure on bank margins,&quot; Ybarra said.</p>
<p>Margins -- the difference between interest charged on loans and paid out on deposits -- have been squeezed by a sharp drop in official lending rates. The Bank of Spain has cut its key money market rate one percentage point to 5.25 percent this year.</p>
<p>But BBV forecasts that lending will rise 11 to 12 percent this year, as the Spanish economy recuperates and consumer spending accelerates, after a rise of 8.4 percent last year. Deposits and funds are seen up 14 to 15 percent after a 12.6 percent rise in 1996.</p>
<p>BBV has been capitalising on its new Latin American investments, where it is taking advantage of the high growth and margins that will compensate for falling domestic margins and for the potential loss of business tied to the launch of the euro set for 1999.</p>
<p>This year, after an aggressive 1996 shopping spree, BBV has acquired 40 percent of Provincial in Venezuela and 71.7 percent of Credito Argentino. As of May, BBV had assets of 3.9 trillion pesetas and 1,150 offices in Latin America.</p>
<p>Excluding write-downs for goodwill and financing costs, Latin America contributed 30.67 billion pesetas toward pre-tax earnings of 142.92 billion pesetas in the first half.</p>
<p>Including goodwill and financing, overall BBV group pre-tax profit was 129.52 billion pesetas. Latin America provided net interest income of 86.77 billion pesetas and ordinary income of 124.18 billion pesetas. ($ = 153.5 Spanish Pesetas)</p>
