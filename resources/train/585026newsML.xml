<p>Telecom Corp of New Zealand on Wednesday reported a sharp decline in annual net profit to NZ$581.4 million ((US$403 million) from NZ$716.8 million in 1996, but rejected the claim its best days were over in an increasingly competitive marketplace.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I would not concede that,&quot; chief executive Roderick Deane told a briefing of journalists and analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that although there's a lot more competition, this is going to continue to be one of the most exciting marketplaces of any industry in this country, and indeed in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The telephone utility, half-owned by U.S. telecommunications giants Ameritech and Bell Atlantic with a quarter share each, said reported earnings for 1997 reflected abnormal costs.</p>
<p>One-off provisions of NZ$101.5 million after tax were made for Telecom's ongoing restructuring programme and for making the company's computer systems millennium compliant, while NZ$87.6 million was put aside to cover the losses incurred by Australian subsidiary Pacific Star.</p>
<p>Normalised earnings, excluding the effect of abnormals and Pacific Star, were NZ$770.5 million compared with NZ$746.4 million in 1996, an increase of 3.2 percent. However, this compared with earnings growth of 19.5 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Sharemarket response to the result was muted, with Telecom stock closing five cents weaker at NZ$6.63 on light volume.</p>
<p>But analysts said the overall result was disappointing.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the company is at a threshold. I can't quite see where the revenue growth is coming from,&quot; said independent analyst Brian Gaynor, who also questioned the inclusion of Pacific Star's losses as abnormal items on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Gaynor noted cellular growth in the fourth quarter of the financial year was very slow and said only enhanced network services could provide significant growth in the future.</p>
<p>Telecom's enhanced network services, which include Internet vehicle Xtra and cable television venture First Media, grew by 40.6 percent.</p>
<p>Core businesses revenue growth was less spectacular.</p>
<p>National calls revenue grew by just 0.9 percent and international outbound calls by 2.5 percent, while cellular revenues were up 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>Telecom described core revenue growth as &quot;solid&quot; and commended its own performance in a sluggish New Zealand economy. &quot;If you look at our revenues they're still growing strongly and I think pleasingly given the slowdown in the economy,&quot; Deane said.</p>
<p>&quot;The revenue targets that our people have for both this year and succeeding years are demanding, and we expect people to meet them. We would be very disappointed if we didn't continue to grow our revenues at a decent rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Guy Hallwright, analyst at First NZ Capital, said Telecom would continue to grow earnings, &quot;but not at same level as they have been able to in the better years of late&quot;.</p>
<p>He said before the profit announcement, analysts had downgraded Telecom's 1997/98 profit expectations from around NZ$900 million to NZ$800 million.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing in today's result to change people's forecasts,&quot; he said.</p>
