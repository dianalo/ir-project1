<p>Dutch and German skaters dominated the opening day of the world single distance speed skating championships on Friday, winning eight of the nine gold medals on offer.</p>
<p>Chinese sprinter Xue Ruihong spoilt the European push for a clean sweep, although her victory did not come easily.</p>
<p>Xue, who leads the women's 500 metres rankings, trailed Germany's Sabine Voelker and Franziska Schenk after the first leg but posted the day's top time of 40.31 seconds in the second race.</p>
<p>Her combined time for both races was one minute 21.06 seconds, 0.27 seconds ahead of Voelker with Schenk third.</p>
<p>Competitors, who have mostly raced indoors this season, said the variable winds at Warsaw's outdoor track, officially registered at 6.0 metres per second, made skating difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;In a hall you know the best performance and this person wins, but it's not always like that outside because the wind varies,&quot; Schenk told reporters after the race.</p>
<p>Dutch skater Rintje Ritsma won the day's most exciting race, the men's 5,000 metres, after passing compatriot Gianni Romme on the last bend to take the gold in seven minutes 02.34 seconds, less than one second ahead of his rival.</p>
<p>Ritsma and Romme, who finished nearly 10 seconds clear of bronze medallist Frank Dittrich of Germany, were neck-and-neck for the entire race with the skater on the inside track holding the advantage.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Romme) knew I had the inside track on the last corner and he had a few fast laps in the middle of the race but he couldn't make a gap,&quot; Ritsma said.</p>
<p>Romme was happy with the result but said the wind was a telling factor.</p>
<p>&quot;I am satisfied that the race went well for me but the wind was a little bit quicker than me at the end,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Germany's Gunda Niemann won the women's 3,000 metres in 4:20.34, nearly four seconds ahead of compatriot Anni Friesinger, with Carla Zylstra of the Netherlands third.</p>
