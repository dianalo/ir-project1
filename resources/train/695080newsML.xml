<p>A crucial stabilisation system aboard Russia's Mir space station was close to reactivation on Sunday and life aboard the damaged orbital outpost was slowly improving, NASA officials said.</p>
<p>Five spinning gyrodyne devices used to maintain the position of the sprawling Mir complex were reactivated and a sixth was expected to be operating soon, said Frank Culbertson, the veteran astronaut who oversees NASA's missions to Mir.</p>
<p>The restoration of the positional pointing system will be a major milestone on the station's road to recovery. Since Wednesday's collision with an unmanned cargo craft, the station has been using fuel-hungry rocket thrusters to stabilise its position.</p>
<p>Mir's three-man crew had a lighter work schedule on Sunday and appeared in good spirits in television pictures released by NASA.</p>
<p>&quot;What you are seeing is a reduction in the adrenaline level,&quot; Culbertson told a news conference. &quot;What you have is a slowly increasing level of comfort on board and on the ground that things are returning to more normal operations.&quot;</p>
<p>Mir commander Vasili Tsibliev and engineer Alexander Lazutkin had opportunities to chat with their families. NASA's Michael Foale was expected to talk with his wife later on Sunday.</p>
<p>Culbertson lauded the efforts of the Mir crew. Tsibliev and Lazutkin were also aboard the station during a serious fire and had to contend with numerous mechanical breakdowns.</p>
<p>&quot;These guys are real heroes,&quot; he said. &quot;It's been a serious situation here. They have remained calm and they have handled it very well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're alive, thank God,&quot; Tsibliev said on Sunday during a brief exchange with flight controllers at the Russian mission control near Moscow.</p>
<p>The Russian space authorities continued to draw up plans for a daring six- to seven-hour spacewalk inside the station to regain power from the crash-damaged module.</p>
<p>Repair gear was to be shipped to the Russian launch site in Kazakhstan on Monday for launch aboard a cargo ship between July 5 and 8. The supplies should arrive at Mir two days later.</p>
