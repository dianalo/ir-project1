<p>Singapore gas oil and jet fuel markets closed firmer on Wednesday in line with rising crude prices and fresh buying interest from the region, traders said.</p>
<p>April Brent crude last traded up 29 cents to $19.74 per barrel on the Internatonal Petroleum Exchange (IPE) following a 33 cent rise on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said the impending shutdown of two crude units in Singapore (Mobil and SRC) in March and one in Indonesia (Dumai) in February as well as the unexpected shutdown of the Balongan refinery in Indonesia has led to some belief that March will be well supported.  </p>
<p>Already some traders are reporting buying interest from Indonesia for jet fuel and gas oil.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a Singapore trader bought 100,000 barrels of jet fuel each at $26.80 and $26.60 for second-half March lifting fob from a German trader and a MidEast trader.</p>
<p>Sources said the trader was seeking to cover earlier sales to Indonesia. They said China has just bought one 25,000-tonne cargo to south China and was still in the market for a 35,000 to 40,0000-tonne cargo for north China.</p>
<p>There was no physical jet fuel trading on Wednesday, trader said.  </p>
<p>They said gas oil buying interest from Hong Kong is still seen at a steady pace to south China for small barge lots at above $210 per tonne on an ex-terminal basis.</p>
<p>In the physical market a European major was bidding for an end March cargo at $24.95 against an offer from a Singapore trader at $25.50.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps rose in tandem with the firmer crude and March paper traded at $25.30 per barrel and was last quoted at $25.20/$25.30 up from Tuesday's 24.70/$24.80, brokers said.  </p>
