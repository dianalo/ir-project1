<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - Australia's improving inflation outlook, along with a slow economy, was the key to the three rate cuts delivered in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>Next week's December quarter inflation figures, as the forecasts show, are expected to show that the moderation continued into the end of 1996. From a policy outlook, the question is whether this can continue. Economists were asked for a view on when they saw the underlying rate of inflation reaching a trough and at what level.</p>
<p>Results show most economists see underlying inflation dipping below of the Reserve Bank's 2-3 percent target range by mid 1997, and start rising in annual terms from there.</p>
<p>The most optimistic of respondents have the annual underlying underlying rate falling to 1.5 percent or lower. This would be the lowest annual rate since the series' inception.</p>
<p>The good news on the inflation outlook is that when underlying inflation does rise, it is expected to be very gradual. Most economists see it moving back towards the top of the target band only by late 1998 or early 1999.</p>
<p>The big dangers to these forecasts were large sustained movements, in either direction, of the Australian dollar, and stronger than expected wages data, economists said.</p>

<p>INFLATION - The moderation in inflation throuh 1996 is expected to have continued in the December quarter, a result that should be well received by financial markets. The CPI is seen moderating most, reflecting the impact of the July 31 rate cut, and it should moderate to under 1.0 percent in annual terms through the first half of the year as the impact of the November and December cuts is seen. The key underlying rate of inflation is expected to have fallen to the lower end of the RBA's target band, and with little sign of inflation pressures in either partial indicators and wages data it looks like staying there for some time, economists said. All up the numbers are seen as being bulli</p>
<p>CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT - The last current account deficit in its current format is expected to show a narrowing driven by a rebound in exports, given they have fallen by over 6.4 percent in the Last three months. Only one forecast has the deficit rising above November's A$1.923 billion shortfall, with talk of large wheat exports in the month seen boosting rural exports.</p>
