<p>A Spanish couple were detained by Brazilian police after they applied for a passport for a Brazilian baby they had unofficially adopted, a police official in the northern city of Belem said on Friday.</p>
<p>Isaac Fernando Maza Gil and Maria Angeles Villa-Garcia arrived in Belem on March 23 and wanted to adopt a Brazilian child officially but they discovered the process took longer than they could stay in Brazil, the official said.</p>
<p>They agreed instead to take a newborn baby girl who was related to a Brazilian woman now living in Spain but who had travelled with the Spanish couple to help them.</p>
<p>The child's real mother entered Villa-Garcia's name on the birth certificate but the couple's plans were discovered when they tried to apply for a passport for the baby.</p>
<p>&quot;The passport office official was suspicious about several things...especially the fact the mother had apparently arrived in Brazil on March 23 and the baby was born on March 31,&quot; the police official said.</p>
<p>The couple were detained on Thursday and face a sentence of between two to six years in jail, the official said.</p>
<p>They were expected however to be released shortly upon payment of bail, he added.</p>
<p>The couple were understood to have paid no money for the baby girl who has now been returned to her natural mother.</p>
