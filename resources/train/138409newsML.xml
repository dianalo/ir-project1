<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Westpac Australia August leading index rises.</title>

<p>The Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index of economic activity, which indicates where activity will be in six to nine months time, rose by 0.1 point or 0.1 percent in August, Westpac said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The annual rate of growth in the index was 2.2 percent, level with July, which was revised down from 3.8 percent.</p>
<p>The coincident index, which provides a broad measure of the current state of activity, rose 0.2 points or 0.1 percent in August, seeing annual growth fall to 3.4 percent from 3.8 percent in July.  </p>
<p>The leading index of inflation rose 0.1 points in August to 4.6 percent, Westpac said.</p>
<p>&quot;The meagre rise in the leading index offers no immediate prospect of an upswing in the pace of economic growth and strengthens the case for an easing in monetary policy in the near term,&quot; Westpac's general manager of economics, Bill Evans, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Evans said the announcement earlier on Wednesday of a 0.3 percent rise in the consumer price index (CPI) in the September quarter, making it 2.1 percent higher over the past year, would also keep pressure on the Reserve Bank for a near term rate cut.  </p>
<p>The rise in the leading index still left it below its level of three months ago, and the annual growth rate has been stuck in a zero to 2.5 percent range for the first eight months of 1996, well below the long term average growth rate, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Following negative growth rates all through 1995, the clear message is that a sustained upswing in economic activity is not likely before the second half of 1997,&quot; Evans said.</p>
<p>The slight uptick in the leading index of inflation might be a concern if repeated in coming months, he said.  </p>
<p>In interpreting the inflation index, Westpac said it was the the direction of movements rather than the absolute level of the growth rate that was important.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the recent trend has been convincingly down, and with the Australian dollar moving to new highs in October, that trend is more likely to reassert itself in the final months of 1996,&quot; Evans said.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Institute, in a commentary on the report, said their view was that monetary policy was too tight and there was scope for the Reserve Bank to lower the cash rate from the current 7.0 percent level.  </p>
<p>&quot;We remain of the view that weakness in activity, rather than inflationary pressures, is the main concern for policy in the coming months,&quot; the institute said.</p>
