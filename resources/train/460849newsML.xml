<p>Tokyo naphtha prices fell in Friday afternoon trade in a technical correction, market participants said.</p>
<p>&quot;As the market was too firm at the beginning of this week, it's correcting itself.&quot; one naphtha trader said.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha for second-half May was said to have been traded at $233.50 between Japanese trading houses. It was assessed at $240.00/241.00 in late Wednesday trading.</p>
<p>The Tokyo oil products market was closed on Thursday for a national holiday.  </p>
<p>First-half June was quoted at about $230.00/232.00 in Friday afternoon dealing. It was sold once at $239.75, and again at $237.50 to a Japanese trader on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, second-half June was bought by the same trader at $235.50.</p>
<p>In low sulphur waxy residue (LSWR) trading, activity was subdued with traders waiting for initial April allocations from Indonesia's state-owned Pertamina.</p>
<p>Traders expect the initial allotment to total about 3.7 million barrels, including 400,000 to 600,000 barrels rolled over from March. --Tokyo Energy Desk +81-3-3432-8837</p>
