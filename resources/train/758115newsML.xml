<p>Sri Lanka's inflation should decline substantially in 1997 compared to 1996, a report by brokerage CT Smith says.</p>
<p>&quot;The relatively stable rupee will keep inflation at around 10 percent, while enhanced liquidity and the lower fiscal deficit will keep interest rates in check,&quot; says the report, received by Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>Annual inflation rose to 15.9 percent in 1996, mainly due to a significant reduction in subsidies and a sharp depreciation of the rupee, which resulted in high cost push inflationary pressure, it says.</p>
<p>The government cut the subsidy on wheat flour in late 1996, which led to a sharp rise in the price of bread.</p>
<p>A severe drought that hit agriculture and industry also put pressure on other prices, the report says.</p>
<p>The rupee had remained relatively stable in the first half of 1997, depreciating only one percent against the U.S. dollar, as compared to four percent in the same period in 1996, it says.</p>
<p>It says high foreign capital inflows, which are seen continuing in the second half as well due to proposed privatisations, should keep the rupee stable.</p>
<p>Falling interest rates were also seen as a key factor in maintaining price stability and controlling inflation.</p>
<p>Interest rates have fallen substantially due to improved liquidity since the Central Bank cut reserve ratios by 300 basis points and allowed exporters to borrow in foreign currency.</p>
<p>Benchmark 12-month treasury bill yields were at 11.99 percent on July 23, compared to 17.11 in January.</p>
