<p>Italian bankers expect interest margins to fall in 1997 and they do not think they will be able to compensate for them with profits from securities operations, sources said after a meeting of bankers and the central bank.</p>
<p>Banks will have to concentrate on containing costs even though they are likely to see less pressure from bad and doubtful loans this year, the sources quoted the 15 bankers and the Bank of Italy executive board as saying.</p>
<p>With economic growth still &quot;too moderate&quot; weak investments, coupled with the availability of alternative funding &quot;are translating into a very moderate trend for loans.&quot; But the rate of current account deposits is rising strongly, spurred by the level of interest rates and by clients wary of increased volatility on financial markets.</p>
<p>In a framework of falling lending rates, interest margins are being squeezed and this is expected to continue in 1997.</p>
<p>Since &quot;the restriction on interest margins cannot be compensated this year by steady sales of securities deals... the objective of containing costs will take on more importance,&quot; a source quoted the bankers as concluding.</p>
<p>But &quot;a positive note comes from the strong deceleration of the weight of bad and doubtful loans on the whole loan sector,&quot; the source said.</p>
