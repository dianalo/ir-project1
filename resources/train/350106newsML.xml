<p>India's reforming economy shows signs of strong growth, but conflicting policy signals from the ruling coalition and infrastructure bottlenecks are eroding the confidence of foreign investors, analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;India is a very attractive destination. There is no doubt about it. But the government must give proper signals,&quot; Manoshi Roy, director of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), told Reuters.</p>
<p>Analysts said that while sectors such as agriculture have been sources of growth, infrastructure bottlenecks were dragging down overall growth and exports.</p>
<p>India says it wants to attract $10 billion in foreign direct investment every year to keep gross domestic product (GDP) growth at around seven percent. India attracted only $1.9 billion in such investments in 1995/96 (April-March).</p>
<p>Last week, the government said GDP growth in the current 1996/97 fiscal year was estimated at 6.8 percent, compared with 7.1 percent in the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has given conflicting signals. Look at Tata-SIA. There is a confusion in minds of investors,&quot; Roy said.</p>
<p>She was referring to a $600 million plan by Singapore Airlines and India's Tata group to launch a domestic airline. The plan was publicly opposed by Civil Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim while the Industry Ministry supported it.</p>
<p>In a new aviation policy, India announced on January 24 that it would allow 40 percent foreign investment in domestic airlines, but did not rule on whether foreign airlines would be allowed to make such investments.</p>
<p>&quot;The rights and wrongs of the project apart, what stood out in glaring relief was the extent to which one arm of the government was out of sync with another,&quot; Financial Express newspaper said in an editorial on Sunday.</p>
<p>The policy was part of a package of economy-boosting measures promised by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Gowda's government on Thursday listed measures taken in January to spur the economy, mainly steps to boost investment in telecommunications and roads.</p>
<p>Bombay's benchmark 30-share index plunged 127.58 points on Friday, or 3.63 percent, to 3,382.47, unimpressed by the list.</p>
<p>The government said on Thursday that agricultural production was forecast to grow by 3.7 percent after contracting by 0.1 percent in 1995/96 and manufacturing production was projected to grow by 10.6 percent, down from 13.6 percent in 1995/96.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is no reason for being pessimistic,&quot; Roy said. &quot;What is pulling down growth is infrastructure, which is growing only at two to three percent.&quot;</p>
<p>She said exports were also affected by infrastructure problems like poor port facilities and shortages of railway cars.</p>
<p>India said on Friday that exports fell to $2.75 billion in December, down 1.8 percent from the $2.80 billion of December 1995.</p>
<p>Roy said government initiatives to attract private funds in ports and roads were bound to bear fruit, &quot;but the government must speak with a unified voice&quot;.</p>
<p>Inflation, currently at 7.5 percent, would be a worry only if it crossed 10 percent, Roy said.</p>
<p>But she added she was not sure if the government would succeed in keeping the fiscal deficit down to a targeted five percent in 1996/97, against 5.9 percent in the previous year.</p>
<p>She said the government was shying away from raising state-controlled petroleum prices to continue subsidising fuel, which she said could add to government expenditure.</p>
<p>Analyst P.N. Vijay said the government's decisions to introduce lending of stocks and allow foreign funds in state securities will eventually help the markets.</p>
<p>&quot;While it is no doubt true that the credibility of the government has been severely eroded by the events of the last few days, the market should also understand that things do not happen overnight,&quot; he wrote in the Hindustan Times.</p>
