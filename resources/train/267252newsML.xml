<p>U.S. municipal bond prices ended 1/2 point higher amid a 1-1/2 point U.S. Treasury bond surge ignited by some bullish economic news and a solid five-year note auction.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no deals probably till January (and) governments today I think heaved a sigh of relief after the five-year got bid on and placed,&quot;  one trader said. &quot;And even though the results were kind of a little weaker than what people were thinking, I think just getting it out of the way made people kind of feel better. The thing basically had a bid ever since Philly Fed came out.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Thursday said its diffusion index of business activity in the manufacturing sector fell to -2.2 in December from 6.4 in November. Forecasts called for 7.4.</p>
<p>The biggest new deal--negotiated or competitive--scheduled for next week is a $60 million New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation offering.</p>
<p>&quot;Anybody who wants to buy bonds (is) going to have to go to the secondary because there's not going to be a lot of issuance (in) the next few weeks,&quot; the trader said. &quot;So you get some buying anxiety from people who have cash or are short.&quot;  </p>
<p>A municipal analyst said muni cash closed up 1/2 point overall. High-grade issues improved by three basis points overall, and more on the long end. Dollar bonds closed up 5/8 of a point, he said.</p>
<p>Activity was moderate to active, the analyst said, adding that longer-dated paper outperformed because much of what was out for the bid on Thursday was in the intermediate range.</p>
<p>In debt futures, the March municipal contract closed up 1-3/32 at 116-1/32. The March T-bond contract closed up 1-3/32 at 113-5/32. The MOB spread was 92 ticks.</p>
<p>In Treasury cash, the government's 30-year bond closed up 1-16/32 at 98-28/32 to yield 6.59 percent.</p>
