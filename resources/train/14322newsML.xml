<title>ARGENTINA: Argentina may use YPF stake as loan collateral.</title>
<headline>Argentina may use YPF stake as loan collateral.</headline>

<p>Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez is studying using the government's remaining stake in YPF SA as collateral for a loan of up to $1.0 billion, his chief aide said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Economy Minister has acknowledged this and is studying it,&quot; aide Carlos Rodriguez told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the loan from international banks could be about $1.0 billion &quot;but it depends...on whether we sell all or part&quot; of the government's 20 percent stake in the oil company, which was privatized in 1993.  </p>
<p>Fernndez revealed last week that Argentina would have to raise $1.0 billion from privatizations this year to bridge the projected $6.6 billion budget gap. Most of that revenue would come from the sale of the YPF stake, he said.</p>
<p>He had hoped for $1.2 billion of budget-boosting funds from a fiscal austerity package sent to Congress last week, but says parliamentary delays are now likely to reduce the impact to $600 million. Fernndez also spoke last week of seeking $4.0 billion of fresh loans this year.</p>
<p>An International Monetary Fund mission is currently in town studying Fernndez's efforts to bridget the deficit. The IMF had agreed to a $2.5 billion deficit for the whole year.</p>
<p>Rodrguez, who had told Ambito Financiero newspaper in an interview Monday that the IMF mission would last two or three weeks, told reporters the aim was to renegotiate terms of a $1.05 billion, 21-month standby IMF loan for Argentina in April &quot;for which we need a waiver for the second quarter and to set more realistic goals.&quot;</p>
<p>Fernndez said Friday after meeting the IMF mission that he foresaw &quot;no problems in getting a waiver&quot; and had the IMF's support for his fiscal austerity programme.</p>
<p>Once such a waiver is secured, Rodrguez said, the government might be interested in seeking an Extended Fund Facility, such as the one Argentina secured in March 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is not healthy to start an Extended Fund Facility on the base of a failed standby,&quot; said Rodrguez.</p>
<p>The official said he expects Roque Fernndez to launch a roadshow in foreign debt markets once it becomes clear what Argentina's financing needs are in the light of the IMF accord and Congress' treatment of his austerity package.</p>
