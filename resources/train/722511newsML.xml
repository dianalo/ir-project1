<p>American Financial Group Inc said Friday it signed merger agreements with two of its subsidiaries, American Financial Corp  and American Financial Enterprises Inc.</p>
<p>The company on April 23 said it wanted to cut corporate expenses by reorganizing itself as a holding company for its two subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The deal calls for American Financial Corp --of which American Financial Group owns all of the common stock and 76 percent of the voting securities-- to merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company.  </p>
<p>Holders of American Financial Corp's series F and G preferred stock have the remaining 24 percent voting power of the subsidiary, the company said.</p>
<p>Holders of series F preferred stock will receive $22.35 per share, $0.85 a share more than the company originally proposed. Holders of series G preferred shares will receive $10.50 a share. Holders of both series can choose between receiving cash or shares of a to-be-issued new series J preferred stock, or a combination of the two.  </p>
<p>The company said series J holders will hold about 23 percent of the American Financial Corp's voting power after the merger. The stock will have a liquidation value of $22.35 a share and carry a $1.90 annual dividend payable twice a year.</p>
<p>The company said the agreement calls for American Financial Corp to issue $70.4 million in liquidation value of the new series J.  </p>
<p>American Financial Corp can redeem the series J preferred stock at 103 percent of the principal amount eight years after it was issued, 101.5 percent after the ninth year, and 100 percent after the tenth year, the company said.</p>
<p>The company also reiterated its deal with American Financial Enterprises, of which it holds about 83 percent of the common stock. The company will give shareholders one American Financial Group share for each share they hold or $37 in cash.</p>
<p>The company said there are 2.7 million American Financial Enterprises shares outstanding it doesn't own. the holders of the 2.7 million shares need to approve the deal by a two-third majority, the company added.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman was not immediately available to elaborate on the deal.</p>
<p>American Financial Group's stock hit a new 52-week high of 44-3/16 Friday and traded at 44 in the afternoon, up 15/16. American Financial Enterprises shares closed at 40-1/2 July 3.</p>
