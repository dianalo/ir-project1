<p>Paper merchant Spicers Paper Ltd said on Friday that demand for its products were improving but static prices were expected to produce results for the current six months in line with those of the first half.</p>
<p>&quot;However, at this early stage, the outlook for 1997/98 is more positive,&quot; managing director Peter Hammond said in a statement accompanying half year results.  </p>
<p>&quot;Increasing international demand for fine paper, expected moderate improvements in pricing, and benefits flowing from the integration of our Asian acquisitions and merger of the stationery operations should all contribute to a further recovery in profits,&quot; Hammond said.</p>
<p>Spicers reported a net profit of A$6.1 million for the half year to December 31, down from A$14.0 million a year earlier.  </p>
<p>The latest half year result represented a recovery from the A$2 million profit recorded for the six months to June 1996.</p>
<p>Sales fell five percent to A$535.16 million in the half.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand pattern for fine paper during the half year was consistent with our expecations,&quot; Hammond said. &quot;The company's sales tonnages were up in all markets, with the increase in volume in the USA being particularly pleasing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, average selling prices were down by 14 percent in Australia, 17 percent in New Zealand and 20 percent in the United States compared with a year earlier.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Australian stationery products experienced the same pressure on selling prices, coupled with sluggish consumer demand and the impact of significant industry rationalisation,&quot; Hammond said.</p>
<p>Distribution businesses acquired in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong were trading in line with expectations and had made a positive contribution to the half year result, Hammond said.</p>
<p>He said the Asian businesses would add about A$120 million a year to sales of fine paper.</p>
<p>Spicers is Australia's biggest manufacturer and distributor of paper-based stationery. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
