<p>Britain's Hambros Plc, which owns the investment bank of the same name, said on Tuesday it was considering whether to make further high level control changes following a probe into the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) affair.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to consider, with our regulators, whether any other changes should be made to high level controls,&quot; Hambros' chairman Lord Hambro told shareholders at the group's annual meeting.</p>
<p>But Hambros said everyone who should have resigned over the bank's role in the discredited 1.2 billion pound ($2 billion) takeover of the CWS had left.</p>
<p>&quot;We have received the resignation of all those directors whom we believe it is appropriate should leave the bank as a result of the CWS matter,&quot; Hambro, who was chairing his last meeting, added.</p>
<p>Hambros advised entrepreneur Andrew Regan's Galileo and Guernsey-based investment trust Lanica on the failed bid for mutually-owned supermarkets-to-funeral parlours group CWS.</p>
<p>Regan, his business associate David Lyons and former CWS manager Allan Green, face possible prosecution by Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which took over a private CWS action.</p>
<p>CWS accused Regan and Lyons of &quot;aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the theft and for handling stolen property&quot;. Green is accused of theft of confidential documents which ended up in the hands of the predators and a host of City institutions.</p>
<p>Earlier this month three senior corporate financiers resigned after a probe by law firm Norton Rose found the conduct of those concerned fell &quot;well short of the standards of good business practice&quot;.</p>
<p>The Bank of England and City watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) are both examining the Norton Rose report, this will lead to a decision over whether an investigation is needed and whether action will be taken.</p>
<p>Hambros had already made an unreserved apology to the Co-op in April over its conduct and paid a substantial sum to the group.</p>
<p>Hambro told the packed shareholders meeting at the group's headquarters he believed Hambros had acted quickly and decisively in commissioning the probe and acting on its conclusions.</p>
<p>But he emphasised the changes to internal procedures recommended by the report were because it had found failures in the implementation of the procedures rather than major deficiencies in the procedures themselves.</p>
<p>Hambro said he could not comment further on the &quot;CWS matter&quot; for legal reasons, although he acknowledged shareholders were &quot;interested and concerned&quot; about the bank's role.</p>
<p>Despite intense speculation about Hambros' future following the embarrassing debacle, none of the shareholders at the meeting questioned the chairman or his successor Sir Chips Keswick on its ramifications.</p>
<p>Some bankers say it will be hard for the bank to regain client confidence after the CWS affair, with relationships damaged by the fall-out.</p>
<p>Keswick told reporters after the meeting Hambros was not looking for a new group chief executive.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not looking for a new group chief executive. I will be a working chairman,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There had also been speculation that Hong Kong-based investment fund Regent Pacific, which owns between three and four percent of Hambros, would question the board at the meeting.</p>
<p>But the fund, which has said it wants Hambros to return value to shareholders, did not do so.</p>
<p>Hambro's sense of humour was tested by one elderly shareholder who repeatedly interrupted the chairman with a succession of questions and opinions, several of which were posed in Latin.</p>
<p>But the exchanges were well received by shareholders and the meeting remained good-humoured.</p>
<p>A former employee, Andrew Gibson-Watt, said the chairman had been &quot;unflinching in adversity&quot; during his 45 years at the bank, showing both courage and determination. Hambro would, he said, be able to spend more time on his farm in Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>Hambro, the fifth generation of the family since the bank's foundation in 1839, said there had been &quot;many ups and downs&quot; but he had enjoyed every moment and &quot;would not have missed it for the world&quot;.</p>
<p>Hambros said it had appointed former Conservative government minister Peter Brooke as a non-executive director of the group. It has also appointed David Lewis, currently vice-chairman of Hambros Bank, to the board as a director. ($ = 0.597 British Pounds)</p>
