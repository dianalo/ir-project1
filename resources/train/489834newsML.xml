<headline>Optimism in S.Korea on peace talks with North.</headline>

<p>South Korean media on Sunday expressed optimism that communist North Korea would agree to peace talks to defuse the world's last Cold War era flashpoint.</p>
<p>&quot;North Korea virtually agrees to four-way talks,&quot; said a headline in the Chosun Ilbo daily.</p>
<p>Earlier, media reports quoted Seoul officials as saying Pyongyang had asked for a meeting with U.S. and South Korean officials to give its answer to the proposal for four-way peace talks made last April by U.S. President Bill Clinton and his South Korean counterpart Kim Young-sam.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a couple of twists and turns, but North Korea will in the end accept four-way talks,&quot; the Dong-A Ilbo quoted one unnamed official as saying.</p>
<p>The talks, also including China, are aimed at securing a lasting peace to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>Newspapers said Pyongyang's overture was a desperate move to get badly needed food aid.</p>
<p>North Korea's demand for substantial food assistance as a condition for taking part in any talks was rejected last month by both Seoul and Washington, who said aid could only be discussed as part of four-way talks.</p>
<p>&quot;North Korea's proposal for a meeting to give its response is clearly targeting food assistance from South Korea,&quot; said an editorial in the Hankook Ilbo daily.</p>
<p>&quot;North Korea must have taken into consideration that unless the food shortage problem was solved soon, Kim Jong-il's leadership and status was in jeopardy.&quot;</p>
<p>Kim Jong-il is seeking to claim the titles of state president and general secretary of the ruling Workers' Party left vacant by the death of his father, Kim Il-sung in 1994. There are expectations he will assume the positions around the third anniversary of the elder Kim's death in July.</p>
<p>South Korean state radio on Saturday reported that Seoul authorities had given a &quot;favourable response&quot; to North Korea's suggestion of a meeting this month to present its formal answer to the peace proposal.</p>
<p>The suggestion was made in a gathering of officials from the two Koreas and the United States in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether Pyongyang had indicated it would agree to talks, reject the offer or set new conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;The South Korean government believes North Korea is highly likely to agree officially to four-way talks at a meeting,&quot; the Dong-A Ilbo said.</p>
<p>Seoul officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>North Korea is keeping the world guessing on whether it is finally prepared to discuss burying Cold War hostilities as it slides toward famine.</p>
<p>It desperately needs international aid to stave off a human catastrophe and has been trying to use its participation in the four-way talks as leverage to extract food assistance.</p>
<p>South Korea has pledged $6 million and the United States $10 million to a $41 million World Food Programme (WFP) appeal for aid for impoverished North Korea.</p>
<p>On Friday, the WFP more than doubled the appeal to $95 million to feed babies and toddlers.</p>
<p>On March 5, U.S. and South Korean officials gave North Korean representatives a briefing on the proposal, and emerged cautiously optimistic that Pyongyang would participate.</p>
