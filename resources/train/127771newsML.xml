<p>French President Jacques Chirac embarks on his riskiest foreign trip on Saturday when he flies to Syria to start a six-day Middle East tour aimed at exerting European influence on the region's stalled peace process.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of stymied Arab-Israeli negotiations and a recent surge of violence, Chirac will appeal to the region's leaders, especially in Israel, Syria and the Palestinian territories, not to squander the chance of peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will try to convince all the leaders in the region that they must resume the peace process. At this historic moment, they must choose the right path,&quot; Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said,</p>
<p>The French leader, seeking a peacemaking role for Europe alongside a reluctant United States, sparked a diplomatic row with Israel even before setting off from Paris.</p>
<p>After the Israelis objected to his intention to send Foreign Minister Herve de Charette to visit a disputed PLO headquarters in Arab East Jerusalem, Chirac decided not to take de Charette to Israel at all.</p>
<p>Instead French junior health minister Herve Gaymard will visit Orient House, a move the Israelis grudgingly accepted behind the diplomatic fiction that Gaymard will discuss health matters, not politics.</p>
<p>While hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swallowed that compromise, he may find Chirac's main message harder to digest -- that Israel can only hope for lasting security if it exchanges land for peace and allows a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Elected in May on a platform opposing territorial concessions, Netanyahu has slowed talks with the Palestinians to an ill-tempered crawl and failed to resume negotiations with Syria, which says they must start where they left off with his Labour predecessor, Shimon Peres.</p>
<p>Supporters of Netanyahu's Likud-led government say that by embracing a Palestinian state, even if that has been French policy since the late president Francois Mitterrand enunciated it in Jerusalem in 1982, Chirac has disqualified France from any political role in Arab-Israeli peacemaking.</p>
<p>But the French leader will also use a keynote speech to Haifa, northern Israel, to underline close economic, scientific nd technical cooperation with the Jewish state and voice admiration for its &quot;scientific genius&quot;, Colonna said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu is not the only Middle East leader for whom Chirac's message contains uncomfortable elements.</p>
<p>Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, with whom France's ties have warmed since Chirac took office 18 months ago, may welcome his insistence that all states in the region must be able to exercise fully sovereignty over their entire territory as it applies to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.</p>
<p>But he may be less enthusiastic about applying that principle to Lebanon, a former French protectorate, where some 30,000 Syrian troops ensure that Damascus' will prevails in Beirut.</p>
<p>Officials expect Chirac and Assad to lay to rest a long-running dispute over Syria's unserviced debt to France, opening the way for new financial aid.</p>
<p>Middle East experts will be watching to see how Chirac treats the issue of Lebanon, and of human rights, in his only dinner speech and joint news conference with Assad.</p>
<p>President Yasser Arafat may be delighted at the call for a Palestinian state from the friend he dubbed &quot;Doctor Chirac&quot; on a visit to Paris this month.</p>
<p>But the French president is also expected to underline the need for democracy, not autocracy, when he becomes the first foreign leader to address the Palestinian Legislative Council in Ramallah next Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two men will then fly to Gaza, tour a refugee camp and visit the site of a planned sea port opposed by Israel.</p>
<p>Chirac will round off his trip by visiting Jordan, to underline his support for King Hussein's peace policy, Lebanon, to reaffirm his support for its full sovereignty voiced on a visit last April, and Egypt, where he will brief President Hosni Mubarak on his talks during a stopover at Cairo airport.</p>
