<p>Hong Kong stocks tumbled to a sharply lower close on Friday as uncertainty about government plans to curb rising real estate prices rattled property stocks.</p>
<p>An initial rally of 123.79 points, following new record highs on Wall Street overnight, were quickly wiped out and the Hang Seng Index closed on a loss of 232.77 points, or 1.55 percent, at 14,822.97 after reaching a session low of 14,727.48.</p>
<p>&quot;Developers are very weak and all the other sectors are doing very little,&quot; said Miles Remington, sales trader at SocGen-Crosby Securities. &quot;Red chips, which were driving the market before, are going off.&quot;</p>
<p>The red chip China-Affiliated Corporations Index tumbled to a low of 3,334.71 before ending the session up 3.93 points, or 0.12 percent, at 3,417.43.</p>
<p>Total turnover was HK$22.51 billion compared with HK$24.5 billion on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index ended the abbreviated two-day week, the first trading sessions under Chinese rule, on a loss of 373.82 points, or 2.46 percent.</p>
<p>The final trading day under British rule last Friday saw Hang Seng Index rise to a record closing high of 15,196.79.</p>
<p>Investors had hoped that after a three-day holiday to mark Hong Kong's July 1 return to Chinese rule, the market would usher in a new era under China with strong gains.</p>
<p>But those plans were dashed when Hong Kong's new Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa revealed plans on Tuesday to increase housing supply in an effort to deal with rising property prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we are worried about the property sector which has dragged the index down,&quot; said Alex Wong, technical analyst at Dharmala Securities.</p>
<p>Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd tumbled HK$2.00 to HK$71.75 and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd slid HK$2.50 to HK$86.25.</p>
<p>Remington said the property sector looked oversold but more downside could lie ahead with some investors now negative on a three-month view since Tung is only expected to reveal specific details of his housing plans in a policy statement in October.</p>
<p>Henderson Land Development Co Ltd managed to shed its losses to end up HK$0.25 at HK$66.00 after falling to a low of HK$63.75.</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc forged ahead to hit an all-time high of HK$243.00 before closing up HK$3.00 at HK$241.00.</p>
<p>July Hang Seng Index futures closed down 70 points at 14,830.</p>
