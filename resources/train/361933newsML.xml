<p>Taiwan's armed forces were on routine alert against surprise attacks by &quot;the enemy&quot; -- communist China -- as the island began celebrating the five-day Lunar New Year holiday on Thursday, state radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;As families gather to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the national armed forces sacrifice their holidays to stay on high alert,&quot; the broadcast said. &quot;The preparation is aimed at effectively deterring the enemy's attempt to attack Taiwan.&quot;</p>
<p>The radio quoted Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling as saying the unspecified enemy was mostly likely to attack at the time of important holidays.</p>
<p>Taiwan's only security threat, China, has regarded the Nationalist-ruled island as a rebel province since a civil war separated them in 1949 and regularly pledges to retake Taiwan by force if it declares independence.</p>
<p>In mid-1995, China mounted eight months of war games and missile tests near Taiwan and clamped a freeze on what had been slowly warming unofficial talks with Taiwan after President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States.</p>
<p>Beijing interpreted Lee's trip as a bid to promote Taiwan's independence. Taipei denies Beijing's allegations that it has secretly abandoned its advocacy of eventual reunification.</p>
