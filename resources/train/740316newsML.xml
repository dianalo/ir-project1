<p>Prime Minister Lionel Jospin pondered the final choices on tax rises and savings measures on Friday ahead of an audit of public finances expected to show on Monday that France's deficit has strayed well beyond the target for European monetary union.</p>
<p>The newspaper Le Monde said Jospin and senior ministers would finalise on Saturday a package of measures to reduce the 1997 deficit by about 30 billion francs ($5 billion), and announce them when issuing the results of the audit by two senior civil servants.</p>
<p>Jospin ordered the audit when he took office in June and discovered his left-wing government had inherited from its conservative predecessors a deficit well above the three percent of gross domestic product set in the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>In a leaked handover note, defeated prime minister Alain Juppe acknowledged a shortfall of about 35 billion francs this year and a drift towards a 4.0 percent deficit in 1998.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac said this week the 1997 deficit was running at about 3.5 percent. Government sources say they expect 3.6-3.7 percent.</p>
<p>With financial markets and European partners watching, Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn will present the results of the audit and the deficit-cutting package at a news conference (0800 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;This is the moment of truth for Jospin's 'left-wing realism',&quot; political commentator Alain Duhamel said. &quot;From that moment, the left will have to make known how it will reconcile its election promises, French people's hopes, the constraints of the euro and the deficit situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn has said Paris will not make the strict &quot;3.0&quot; percent reading of the treaty adopted by Germany, but it will take measures to bring down the deficit this year -- the reference year for launching a single European currency in 1999 -- and aim to reach three percent next year.</p>
<p>Most of this year's measures are expected to be on the revenue side, with an extra &quot;euro surcharge&quot; on corporate tax expected to raise about 12 billion francs, officials said.</p>
<p>Le Monde said the government was considering extending into 1998 this &quot;exceptional increase&quot; in corporate tax to around 40 percent of profits from the current level of 36.6 percent.</p>
<p>Some once-off revenue would be raised from &quot;sleeping treasuries&quot; such as the profits of the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Jospin was hesitating over whether to reverse an income tax cut for the top tax brackets enacted by Juppe's centre-right government, after ruling out as impractical proposals to make the rich pay a higher wealth tax or an extra levy on investment income.</p>
<p>Le Monde said Strauss-Kahn would pledge that the extra taxes would not exceed the revenue shortfall disclosed by the audit.</p>
<p>The French received some involuntary comfort on Friday from German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, one of the toughest sticklers for a strict reading of the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p>In a speech in Munich, Waigel said Bonn would meet the three percent deficit target this year but added that drastic savings or tax hikes would be counterproductive for growth and jobs.</p>
<p>That is exactly the Socialist-led French government's argument for rejecting a new round of austerity, just as the economy is starting to grow faster.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the driving force behind the monetary union project, refused on Friday to comment on France's prospects of qualifying for the single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We should leave the French to do what they themselves want to do. It is not for me to say,&quot; Kohl told a news conference when asked how he rated Paris's chances of joining EMU. ($ = 6.056 French Francs)</p>
