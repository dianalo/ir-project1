<p>Angola's rebel UNITA movement said on Wednesday it had completed disarming its guerrilla force and dismantled all its military control posts, substantially meeting demands of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>&quot;Our soldiers are quartered and practically we have complied 98 percent with stipulations of the Security Council. We believe the Security Council will be satisfied with what we have accomplished,&quot; UNITA Brigadier Antonio Tchassanha told Reuters.</p>
<p>A final declaration was expected later by UNITA's chief peace negotiator in Luanda, Isaias Samakuva, who has been meeting with the movement's political commission in its central highlands stronghold of Bailundo.</p>
<p>Wednesday marked the second anniversary of the signing of the Lusaka Protocol in Zambia which ended two decades of civil war between government and rebel UNITA forces.</p>
<p>The United Nations Security Council, which sent 6,500 peace keepers to Angola to help implement the peace accord, has threatened sanctions against UNITA if it does not complete its military obligations in a peace timetable by November 20.</p>
<p>&quot;There have certainly been enormous efforts made by UNITA and most of the tasks appeared to have been completed, but the Joint Commission will meet tomorrow (Thursday) to verify the situation,&quot; U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst told Reuters.</p>
<p>In the meantime Paul Hare, a special envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton who arrived in Angola on Wednesday, travelled to meet UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in Bailundo to hear for himself progress in the peace process.</p>
<p>Tchassanha said UNITA had complied with the timetable and had disarmed over 63,000 troops, lifted 35 remaining road control posts and handed in lists of its legislators for a government of national unity.</p>
<p>He said UNITA had also sent nine of its top military generals to the government-controlled capital for integration into the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA), and had presented 32,633 troops for selection into the single army.</p>
<p>&quot;All we are missing are about 1,000 police members who are awaiting U.N. transportation to assembly camps. I am convinced we are close to the final results of the Lusaka Protocol,&quot; Tchassanha said.</p>
