<p>The best news in Japanese Sunday newspapers these days is perhaps the &quot;staff-wanted&quot; pages.</p>
<p>Advertisements for job openings have been rising steadily and it's now possible to talk of staff-wanted pages instead of just the one page a few years ago.</p>
<p>The number of advertisements is visible evidence that the job situation has improved and that last year's worries of large-scale layoffs were overdone.</p>
<p>Government statistics too are upbeat. The number of job openings climbed to 76 for every 100 job seekers in January, compared with 66 a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at various data, the situation seems extremely bright,&quot; said an official with the government's Management and Coordination Agency.</p>
<p>The cheerful tone contrasts with the dark mood of the last few years when Japanese firms, stung badly by a strong yen, froze the hiring of new graduates.</p>
<p>Some went as far as to try oust workers in middle management -- in a country where in the past companies have stopped short of laying off staff.</p>
<p>Japan's unemployment rate hit a record 3.5 percent in May and June last year, a low level compared with some European countries but enough to provoke huge headlines here.</p>
<p>WORST FEARS FAIL TO MATERIALISE</p>
<p>Yet dire predictions of vigorous restructuring and a constant shedding of workers failed to materialise.</p>
<p>The reasons are now fairly clear, economists said.</p>
<p>On one hand, business is better, particularly with a weaker yen, which for instance helps exports. On the other, a taboo on firing workers, which has typified the post-war culture of Japan's big companies, persists.</p>
<p>&quot;Traditionally, Japanese firms do not lay off people. They have not yet been pushed to the point where they need to and while they are still showing profits it will be difficult to do so,&quot; said Yasuhiko Ushikubo, an economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).</p>
<p>A number of economists say Japanese companies are not only being slow to restructure, but add they are inefficient in so many areas that when firms do cut costs, firing surplus workers is not necessarily high on the agenda.</p>
<p>Others noted that differences in pay structure as well as a large number of part-time workers give Japanese companies more leeway in terms of where they can cut first.</p>
<p>&quot;There are more buffers. Regular wages only makes up 75 percent of Japanese pay, bonus payments are 20 percent and overtime is five percent,&quot; said Michael Naldrett, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort-Benson.</p>
<p>Economic Planning Agency Minister Taro Aso said on Friday that latest economic data such as that for employment and industrial output showed the economy was looking brighter, although uncertainties remained.</p>
<p>Even though the unemployment rate in January stood at 3.3 percent, unchanged from the previous month, the number of people being forced to leave their jobs had been declining steadily, while those voluntarily quitting to seek new jobs had been rising, he said.</p>
<p>Economists said however, the better outlook in Japan's job market was not expected to lead to any significant drop in the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>They expect it to remain steady at 3.3 or 3.4 percent for the rest of the year, with further improvement impeded by a large mismatch between what employers seek and what job hunters offer.</p>
<p>&quot;Firms want young people but they are getting older applicants. They want people with technical know-how but its desk workers we have too many of in the workplace,&quot; said IBJ's Ushikubo.</p>
<p>CHANGE APPARENT, BUT PROCESS GRADUAL</p>
<p>Change in Japan's labour market is under way but it will be slow and piecemeal, economists say. Once-sacred values such as lifetime employment and pay linked to seniority rather than ability are, for example, still prevalent but are no longer taken for granted.</p>
<p>Some said the failure to restructure aggressively has disappointed foreign investors looking for leaner and meaner firms they believe are needed to bolster Japan's still-young economic recovery.</p>
<p>But others say Japan has managed to avoid painful social costs that have characterised action elsewhere, for example the United States, of simply shedding non-profitable sections of companies.</p>
<p>&quot;There are huge dislocation costs when you put people out of work. Change is taking place very slowly and that's probably the best way to do it,&quot; said Naldrett.</p>
