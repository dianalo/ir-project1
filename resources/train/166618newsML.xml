<title>USA: U.S. Robotics up after profit, revenue surprises.</title>
<headline>U.S. Robotics up after profit, revenue surprises.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>The stock of U.S. Robotics Corp. gained almost 9 percent Tuesday after the computer modem maker pleasantly surprised Wall Street late Monday by reporting that its profits and revenues doubled in its fiscal fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Shares of U.S. Robotics jumped $5.25 to $64.75 in very heavy morning trading on the Nasdaq market, where they were the most actively traded issue.</p>
<p>On Monday, after the market closed, U.S. Robotics said its net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 jumped to $67.47 million, or 71 cents a share, from $34.22 million, or 37 cents a share.</p>
<p>The per-share earnings matched Wall Street estimates of 71 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics also said its revenues expanded in the period to $611.4 million from $293.4 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a great quarter -- in line with expectations is the best way to describe it,&quot; Volpe, Welty &amp; Co analyst Amar Senan said Monday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall they managed to pull the rabbit out of the hat, at least for the quarter,&quot; said Rakesh Sood, an analyst for Hambrecht &amp; Quist. &quot;People were pretty bearish all the way around and were thinking they wouldn't hit their numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>For the full year U.S. Robotics said its net income soared to $224.02 million, or $2.36 a share, from $89.15 million, or $1.05 a share, as revenues jumped to $1.98 billion from $889.3 million.</p>
