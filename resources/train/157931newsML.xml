<headline>Dole appeals to Perot supporters.</headline>

<p>Republican Bob Dole appealed on Wednesday to supporters of Texas billionaire Ross Perot to vote for him in next week's presidential election, saying &quot;the country is at stake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would urge the Perot voters, if you want change, you need to vote for Bob Dole,&quot; he said in an interview on the PBS programme &quot;Talking With David Frost.&quot;</p>
<p>Dole, who last week tried to persuade the Reform Party candidate to abandon his quest for the White House, said he wished Perot were not running.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, he's taking votes from me. President Clinton's got to be the happiest candidate around, because I'm running against Ross Perot and Bill Clinton,&quot; Dole said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish he would endorse me and say, 'Vote for Bob Dole.' The country is at stake. I think he feels that way.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest Reuters tracking poll showed Clinton's lead shrinking to single digits for the first time since October 24. He led Dole by 9.8 percentage points as the number of undecided voters rose above 13 percent. But Dole's support remained stuck at 33 percent -- hardly an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>Perot was above the 8 percent mark, having risen by three points in the past week.</p>
<p>Other polling organisations put Clinton's lead at between 12 and 19 points, pointing to a possible landslide.</p>
<p>In the PBS interview, conducted in Clarksville, Tennessee, on Wednesday during a campaign trip, Dole acknowledged he was the underdog, with just six days left before the Nov. 5 election. But he said that was &quot;not a bad place to be right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, we feel good about our race. I'm optimistic. I know some of the pundits, not all, have written us off, but I don't see that. It's getting better, it's getting better. You can smell it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dole agreed that win or lose, this would be his last campaign, and he reluctantly reflected on what his life might be like if he lost.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, if it happens -- I'm not suggesting it's going to happen, but should it happen -- I'll probably find work. I'll work with those with disabilities and do other things that are fulfilling, but I'm not going to stop and go off and say, 'Well, it's all over.'</p>
<p>&quot;I've been through the valley before, but it's a lot more fun winning,&quot; Dole said.</p>
<p>The former Kansas senator also used the interview to revive his attack on Clinton's ethics, raising the issue of alleged illegal foreign contributions to the Democratic campaign, charging that Clinton knew about them and predicting that the controversy could become &quot;a calamity&quot; after the election.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you're elected and walk into the White House, that first time you walk into the White House after you've taken the oath of office, you assume a new mantle of obligation that's higher, a higher obligation than anybody in America to keep your word and to keep the public trust,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dole said he did not think the American people knew who Clinton was and did not really trust the president.</p>
<p>&quot;But he's been able to sort of glide through all of this ... He's got good footwork, but he hasn't leveled with the American people,&quot; he said.</p>
