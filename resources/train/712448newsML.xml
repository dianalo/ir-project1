<p>The Toronto Maple Leafs landed an experienced backup goaltender Tuesday by signing unrestricted free agent Glenn Healy to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed by the club, but the pact reportedly is worth just under $4 million.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Healy spent the last four seasons backing up New York Rangers All-Star netminder Mike Richter. Healy posted a 5-12-4 record in 1996-97, despite a solid 2.61 goals-against average and a .907 save percentage.</p>
<p>In Toronto Healy will likely find himself in a similar position, serving as backup to Maple Leafs star goalie Felix Potvin.</p>
<p>Healy enjoyed his best seasons with the New York Islanders from 1989-93, backstopping their unexpected run to the Eastern Conference finals in 1993. But he signed as a free agent with the rival Rangers in the offseason.</p>
<p>Healy, who began his 11-year career with the Los Angeles Kings, is the fourth free agent signed by the Maple Leafs, joining wingers Derek King and Mike Kennedy, who signed with Toronto last week, and left wing Kris King, who was inked to a four-year deal Monday.</p>
