<p>European Union social affairs ministers will try this weekend to break a long-standing deadlock over plans to allow firms to set up as European companies, but diplomats say chances of progress are slim.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure I see a breakthrough,&quot; a British diplomat said, predicting the informal talks in Echternach, Luxembourg, on Friday and Saturday would reaffirm the conflict between London and Bonn -- despite Britain's change of government.</p>
<p>The European Commission's proposal for a European company statute, designed to make life easier and cheaper for industry by eliminating the need to set up a network of costly subsidiaries, has been deadlocked for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>The main stumbling block has been provisions on worker participation in company decisions, with Germany promoting its own system of 50-50 &quot;co-determination&quot; between employees and managers and Britain arguing there should be no mandatory rules.</p>
<p>The Commission said in May it saw chances of ending the row in the form of proposals from a high-level expert group headed by Etienne Davignon, the chairman of Belgian holding company Societe Generale and a former European commissioner.</p>
<p>The Davignon group suggested unions and employers should try to agree on the level of worker involvement in individual firms.</p>
<p>If they failed, a set of reference rules would apply, forcing firms to give workers' representatives a fifth of board seats.</p>
<p>The proposal, which the British diplomat said was largely intended to address Bonn's fear &quot;that firms would be able to wriggle out of their co-determination (obligations) by setting up as a European company&quot;, has not fully satisfied either side.</p>
<p>&quot;The rule that one fifth of (board members) should be employees' representatives...is not satisfactory because it doesn't go as far as our own system,&quot; a German diplomat said.</p>
<p>British diplomats, for their part, argue that the Davignon proposals go too far, forcing the hand of firms operating in countries that do not have a tradition of worker participation, such as Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Davignon's idea of imposing mandatory minimum rules would undermine the very useful idea of a European company statute because it would make it unattractive to companies in some EU countries, one said.</p>
