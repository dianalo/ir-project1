<p>The Zimbabwean government fired thousands of workers on Saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights.</p>
<p>The Public Service Commission (PSC) said in a statement that the workers -- including nurses, junior doctors, mortuary attendants, customs officers and firefighters -- would be barred from entering their workplaces on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;All civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours, and remained working for the full working day on 23 August 1996, have been summarily dismissed...with immediate effect,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Union officials from the Public Service Association (PSA) were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers, sub-contracting some of the work to private firms.</p>
<p>The government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on Tuesday, saying it was illegal. But the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of 30 to 60 percent were met.</p>
<p>The stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the Red Cross.</p>
<p>It has also disrupted flights. Some internal services were cancelled, leaving tourists at the Victoria Falls resort stranded, and flights abroad were delayed.</p>
<p>The PSA said 80 percent of the country's 180,000 civil servants took part in the strike which is a rare challenge to President Robert Mugabe, who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980.</p>
<p>Opposition parties, civic organisations and private-sector unions have expressed support for the action and denounced the government's pay rises of up to eight percent for its workers.</p>
<p>Civil servants earn on average Z$1,000 ($100) a month. They say their pay has not kept up at all with inflation, currently running at 22 percent.</p>
