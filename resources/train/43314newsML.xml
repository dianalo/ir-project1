<p>Bungling British thieves stole aircraft engine parts worth 4.5 million pounds ($7 million) and turned them into scrap which they sold for just 1,000 pounds ($1,500), a court heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The gang unwittingly carried out the biggest ever raid in the southern county of Hampshire when they stole high-tech gas turbine components from a Portsmouth factory. But they blew any chance of making a fortune by melting down their haul.</p>
<p>Gang member Thomas Hodgkins, 20, was sent to a young offenders' institution for 15 months but his three accomplices remain at large.</p>
<p>&quot;Hodgkins was looking for scrap. He had the fright of his life when he found out the real value. If he had known he would not have taken part. He was out of his league,&quot; his lawyer said.</p>
