<title>USA: Staples chief -- no FTC decision on merger.</title>
<headline>Staples chief -- no FTC decision on merger.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>The CEO of Staples Inc said Thursday staff at the Federal Trade Comission have made no decision on whether to recommend blocking his office superstore's merger with Office Depot.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Thomas Stemberg also said there has been no talk with FTC staff on divesting some stores as a condition of merger.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been told by the FTC administrative staff at several levels that no decision has been made by the staff&quot; on whether to recommend a preliminary injunction to block the merger, he said.</p>
<p>And, he said, &quot;There have been absolutely no discussions about divestitures.&quot;  </p>
<p>Speaking from his company's Westborough, Mass., headquarters Stemberg expressed continued confidence the FTC would approve the merger.</p>
<p>Stemberg said the companies' joint business plan &quot;foresees several billion dollars of cost savings between now and the year 2000&quot; if the merger goes through and &quot;the majority of these savings will be passed on to our customers&quot; in the form of lower prices.</p>
<p>Earlier this week a Washington newsletter, FTC WATCH, reported that FTC staffers had alerted commissioners to the &quot;possibility&quot; they would recommend a preliminary injunction blocking the merger.  </p>
<p>Representatives of Staples and Office Depot will be meeting with representatives of the FTC in the near future, although Stemberg would not say exactly when.</p>
<p>Such meetings must take place soon if the FTC is to meet a a deadline of Feb. 25, which is the date Staples says it has been promised a decision. Office Depot and Staples have set Feb. 27 for stockholders meetings to consider the merger, originally announced last September.</p>
<p>Under FTC procedures, the staff will make a recommendation to the five FTC commissioners who make the final decision on whether to clear the merger or seek an injunction to block it.  </p>
<p>The FTC decision turns on the question of market definition.</p>
<p>If the FTC decides that Office Depot and Staples are in a special market category of &quot;office supply superstores,&quot; then their merger would leave OfficeMax Inc as their only competition. That would narrow the market from three to two stores, which would likely run into trouble.</p>
<p>But Staples argues that it is actually part of a huge market for office products that together with Office Depot has only a small share of the market.</p>
<p>Staples cites data from independent observers showing the two stores combined have shares on products like copy paper, writing instruments, inkjet cartridges, computer paper and toner that vary from as little as 4.5 percent up to roughly 16 percent.</p>
<p>Staples operates 473 office superstores in the United States, while Office Depot, based in Delray Beach, Fla., has 511 office superstores in the United States.</p>
