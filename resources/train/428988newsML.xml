<p>Wilson Kipketer smashed the world indoor 800 metres record for the second time in two days on Sunday.</p>
<p>Running from the front throughout the world indoor championship final, the Kenya-born Dane took more than a second off the mark he set here on Friday, clocking one minute 42.67 seconds.</p>
<p>Kipketer, world outdoor champion, scorched through the first lap in 24.22 seconds and the 400 in 50.22.</p>
<p>He earned $100,000 for his day's work, collecting $50,000 for the victory and a further $50,000 as a world record bonus.</p>
<p>Asked later if he could go even faster, Kipketer smiled and said: &quot;You saw what I did today.&quot;</p>
<p>He also declined to comment about a possible attempt on Sebastian Coe's 16-year-old world outdoor mark. &quot;I can't think about that now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kipketer, who has lived in Denmark since 1990, was not allowed to compete for his adopted country at last year's Atlanta Olympics. He has been ranked number one in the world for the past three years.</p>
<p>Nigerian Sunday Bada broke his own African record in the men's 400 final, overhauling Briton Jamie Baulch over the last 100 metres to win in 45.51.</p>
<p>Baulch, fastest in the world this year, flew around the first lap on the tight Bercy track in 21.30 but paid the price in the second half of the race when he was unable to hold off the long-striding Nigerian, second in both the last two world indoors.</p>
<p>&quot;The last two times I led from the start,&quot; Bada said. &quot;This time I was going to watch. With 50 metres to go I knew I was going to edge him (Baulch) out.&quot;</p>
<p>A bruising women's race went to the 1993 outdoor world champion Jearl Miles-Clark of the United States in 50.96.</p>
<p>The first lap featured some pushing and shoving and a cameraman nearly came to grief at the first curve on the second lap when he was slow to leave as the runners thundered past.</p>
<p>Miles-Clark, who held off defending champion Sandie Richards of Jamaica in the straight, said: &quot;Just guts brought me home.&quot;</p>
<p>Mozambiques's Maria Mutola, 1993 and 1995 champion, won the women's 800 metres, proving too powerful over the final lap for her rivals.</p>
<p>Mutola, wearing a black ribbon in memory of her father who died in a car crash last month, clocked 1:58.96.</p>
