<p>A retired army general accused of allowing paramilitary killings in central Colombia will be tried by military rather than civilian justice, a civilian court ruled on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The decision by the Upper Council of the Judiciary, a court that resolves disputes over jurisdiction, was criticised by human rights advocates who said it ensured impunity.</p>
<p>Retired Gen. Farouk Yanine will be investigated by the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the armed forces Gen. Harold Bedoya, who regards Yanine as a national hero.</p>
<p>Yanine, who was arrested last month, allegedly gave the green light to a right-wing death squad to massacre 19 merchants in the Magdalena Medio region in 1987. Bedoya has compared him to Latin American independence hero Simon Bolivar and said the army could use more soldiers like him.</p>
<p>&quot;If this ruling is upheld then there's not the slightest doubt that Yanine will have complete impunity,&quot; Jose Miguel Vivanco, regional director of the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, said. The group released a report on Monday alleging Colombia's military and paramilitary groups were linked in a systematic &quot;dirty war&quot; against political dissidents.</p>
<p>The military top brass respects Yanine for what they see as his contribution to pacifying the Magdalena Medio, formerly a haven for leftist guerrillas.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Colombia's chief prosecutor's office said the court ruling would mean scores of other investigations into alleged human rights violations by military personnel would likely be handed over to military justice.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to understand how the Upper Council can consider disappearances and support for paramilitary groups as part of normal military activities. This ruling has grave implications especially considering that military justice tends to be more lenient with its own,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
