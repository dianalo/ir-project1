<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ dollar slides at close as dollar-yen zooms up.</title>
<headline>NZ dollar slides at close as dollar-yen zooms up.</headline>

<p>The New Zealand dollar, caught in the backwash of a rampant U.S. move against the yen, closed sharply weaker on Thursday.</p>
<p>However, the greenback's jump boosted the Trade-Weighted Index to 67.62 from its 67.26 opening.</p>
<p>The dollar ended nearly 3-1/2 yen higher after Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara commented that Japan's trade surplus was not a major issue at the upcoming G7 summit and an imminent rate rise was unlikely.</p>
<p>The kiwi closed at 5.00 p.m. at US$0.6880/85, where it is said to have solid support, against its 0.6916/23 opening.  </p>
<p>Its behaviour was mild compared with most currencies although many players took the opportunity to sell into the rising TWI.</p>
<p>Against the Australian dollar, the kiwi strengthened 20 basis points to A$0.9147/59 which took a half-cent tumble to 16-month lows on much weaker than expected employment data.</p>
<p>The aussie's fall dragged the kiwi with it and some traders used the kiwi's relative strength to buy aussie.</p>
<p>However, the kiwi is seen gaining further on the aussie with today's jobs data increasing the likelihood of another rate cut.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the 10 basis point fall in New Zealand short rates would further dampen demand for new eurokiwi issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they are not as attractive as they were even this morning or yesterday,&quot; said an Auckland-based dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the demand that has kept the kiwi at these really high levels has been euro-related. If euro demand was to subside, or disappear completely, you have to wonder where the buyers come from.&quot;</p>
