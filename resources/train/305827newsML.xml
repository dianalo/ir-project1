<title>USA: Heating oil prices may be heading lower, say experts.</title>
<headline>Heating oil prices may be heading lower, say experts.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Is there hope for homeowners who are paying dearly for heating oil prices this winter?</p>
<p>Market experts said Tuesday that a lengthy rally that has kept crude oil prices near their highest levels in six years and forced up the price of heating oil could drop as supplies start to increase ahead of a seasonal downturn in demand.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy think tank, said in its Monthly Oil Market Report that the return of Iraqi oil exports and rising output from producers outside OPEC pushed oil supplies to a record 74.7 million barrels a day in December, up 1.3 million from November.</p>
<p>The IEA said non-Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries producers should rise by 2.0 million barrels per day to an average of 45.6 million barrels daily in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;New fields in the North Sea and elsewhere, seasonally higher flows in the Northern Hemisphere and the lack of maintenance activities raised non-OPEC supply to a new high of 45.4 million barrels a day in December,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>On Monday, crude oil prices lost 90 cents to $25.19 a barrel after heating oil plunged 2.45 cents to 69.70 cents a gallon on forecasts of warmer temperatures in the U.S. Northeast and Europe.</p>
<p>The selling resumed in Tuesday's trading, with crude oil off 11 cents at $25.08 and heating oil down 0.55 cent at 69.15 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>Oil analysts said that unless nature intervened again in the form of an unusually severe cold snap in key consumer markets, prices looked set for further erosion toward spring.</p>
<p>Traders said the large investment funds, which have speculated on the price of oil over recent months, were bailing out of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices won't collapse but from the second quarter on we will see a steady fall,&quot; said Geoff Pyne, energy economist at Swiss bank UBS.</p>
<p>In the key heating oil market of the northeastern United States, temperatures were forecast to warm through Thursday before a cold snap was expected to send temperatures eight to 10 degrees below normal during the weekend, said Charlie Notis, meteorologist with Freese-Notis Weather in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<p>Now that Iraq is allowed to sell some oil under a United Nations' oil-for-medicine plan, the Iraqis and fellow OPEC members should produce more than 27 million barrels before the end of 1997, well above the cartel's self-assigned but long-ignored 25.03 million barrel export quota ceiling, analysts say.</p>
<p>By contrast, the IEA revised down its estimate for an increase in world demand this year by 200,000 barrels a day to 73.6 million barrels, for a 1.9 million barrel rise on the year. Oil demand usually eases in the second and third quarters when heating oil use falls.</p>
<p>&quot;By the middle of the year, inventories should reach the point when prices will really begin to deteriorate,&quot; said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Centre for Global Energy Studies.</p>
<p>The IEA said fourth-quarter 1996 world demand was 300,000 barrels a day lower than its earlier estimate of 73.6 million, which allowed oil companies to rebuild their inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest data shows that supply is not as tight as it has been. One has to ask what will happen when the cold weather ends,&quot; said Pyne, at UBS.</p>
<p>Just last week oil prices on the New York market were within sight of repeating their post-Gulf War high of $26.80 set in late December, but they have come under heavy selling pressure this week by forecasts of milder weather in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Oil prices should return gradually to more normal (lower) levels in the face of rising supply,&quot; said Mehdi Varzi, at the brokerage house Kleinwort Benson.</p>
