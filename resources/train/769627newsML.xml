<headline>Ready for reform? Chicago's aldermen say they are.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chicago's city council, which runs a city once described as not ready for reform, embarked on a new ethical era Thursday.</p>
<p>The city's aldermen voted 40-9 on Wednesday in favour of an ordinance granting Mayor Richard Daley the power to appoint an ethics board to oversee the 50 members of the city council.</p>
<p>It was the election of Daley's father as mayor in 1955 that prompted Alderman Paddy Bauler to pronounce: &quot;Chicago ain't ready for reform.&quot;</p>
<p>Alderman Ed Smith quipped that so many members of the council had been jailed over the years -- 20 in the past 21 years by one count -- that the council would have to meet at the federal prison in Wisconsin to obtain a quorum.</p>
<p>A previous council-passed ethics ordinance had exempted the aldermen, but this one would require closer record-keeping of campaign contributions, gifts, and staff workers.</p>
<p>Among those voting for the ethics ordinance was 21st Ward Alderman Jesse Evans, who awaits sentencing for accepting bribes from a waste hauler who actually was an undercover informer in the local U.S. Attorney's &quot;Silver Shovel&quot; sting operation.</p>
<p>Federal indictments governing people earning salaries for phantom jobs under the &quot;Haunted Hall&quot; probe have ensnared several other aldermen.</p>
