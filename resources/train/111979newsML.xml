<p>Sun Microsystems Inc chairman Scott McNealy said on Friday that the company would consider further share buy-backs and &quot;opportunistic&quot; acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;Before the cash horde gets too big, we would probably continue to invest in ourselves,&quot; McNealy told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Sun had cash and short-term investments of about US$1.0 billion at June 30, 1996 and almost no debt, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We haven't done much with our financies, except buy our own stock back and it has turned out to be a stunning investment for our shareholders,&quot; said McNealy, who is on a 10-day visit to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In August, Sun directors approved a systematic repurchase programme, which enabled the group to repurchase in the open market a portion of shares of common stock which it expects to issue under its 1990 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan.</p>
<p>The amount of repurchases under this programme would not exceed $450 million over the next three years.  </p>
<p>McNealy, who is also president and chief executive officer of Sun, said the company had bought close to US$2 billion worth of its stock on the market since it was founded in 1982.</p>
<p>Asked whether the Mountain View, California-based company was considering any acqusitions, McNealy replied: &quot;We will be opportunistic.&quot; He said he could not be specific.</p>
<p>McNealy said he could not comment on Sun's 1996/97 first quarter results, which are to be released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sun reported earnings per share of $0.85 in the first quarter of 1995/96. Sun shares closed 50 cents higher at $66, just off its high of $67-3/4 hit on earlier in Thursday trade.  </p>
<p>&quot;It hasn't closed at $66 very often,&quot; McNealy said.</p>
<p>The stock has traded between $36 and $67-3/4 this year.</p>
