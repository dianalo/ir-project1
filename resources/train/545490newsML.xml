<headline>Dubai gold trade reports brisk end to retail blitz.</headline>
<dateline>DUBAI 1997-04-28</dateline>

<p>Dubai gold traders said business in the week to Sunday was buoyant, thanks to frantic retail jewellery sales at the end of a month- long shopping promotion.</p>
<p>But the price of investment bars and coins in the local market stayed under pressure, trading in narrow ranges in line with international bullion, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;This week demand was brilliant. Everyone was rushing to buy gold jewellery so they could enter the 10 kg (22 lbs) raffle draw,&quot; a trader at a large Dubai jewellery manufacturer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales were extremely good, and I would say even better than last year's shopping festival. But now that it is over, we should see things slow down,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>During the promotion, which ended on Saturday, customers spending over 500 dirhams ($136) on gold at the downtown souk could enter a daily draw for one kg (2.2 lbs) of the precious metal and an end-of-festival 10 kg prize.</p>
<p>Traders estimated this generated between seven and 10 tonnes more business in the month.</p>
<p>They quoted the Dubai benchmark ten tola bar -- 3.746 ounces of 24 carat gold -- at 4,730 dirhams ($1,289) on Sunday from 4,720-4,725 dirhams a week earlier.</p>
<p>On the international market, spot gold was last quoted on Saturday at $342.20/70 an ounce from the previous week's $341.20/90.</p>
<p>Dealers said demand from India in the week had continued on an even keel after a bout of political upheaval earlier in the month, coupled with lower world prices, prompted more buying.</p>
<p>After New Delhi's 10-month-old minority government was defeated in a parliamentary confidence vote on April 11, a new prime minister, Inder Kumar Gujral, was sworn in last Monday.</p>
<p>While traders said local retail sales would no doubt fall with the end of the shopping promotion, they forecast a further pick up in demand from India as the country's second wedding season gets into full swing.</p>
<p>Indian and Pakistani buyers are also expected to continue to take advantage of weak global prices -- which in recent weeks tested the four-year lows seen in January -- to stock up on gold bars and coins from Dubai. ($1=3.67 dirhams)</p>
