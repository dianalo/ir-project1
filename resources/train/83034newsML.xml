<p>The world's top-ranked men's badminton doubles team, Indonesians Denny Kantono and Antonius, fell to countrymen Chandra Wijaya and Sigit in Friday's semifinals of the U.S. Open.</p>
<p>The bronze medallists at the 1996 Olympics were 9-15 15-10 15-6 losers at the Orange County Badminton Club.</p>
<p>Wijaya and Sigit, who usually play with other partners, are unranked as a pair internationally.</p>
<p>The winners will play Malaysia's Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock, ranked third in the world. The 1996 Olympic silver medallists beat South Korea's Ha Tae Kwon and Kim Dong Moon 15-6 9-15 15-12.</p>
<p>Wijaya and Sigit took control in their third game by building a 7-0 lead. Kantono and Antonius failed to score on their first four serves of that game.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Indonesia's top-seeded Mia Audina continued to dominate her opposition in women's singles. The 17-year-old 1996 Olympic silver medallist, ranked fourth in the world, earned an 11-5 11-0 victory over Canada's Denyse Julien.</p>
<p>The match was the third in a row in which Audina swept her opponent. In three of those six games, Audina did not concede a point.</p>
<p>Audina will seek her first major tournament championship Saturday when she plays Denmark's second-seeded Camilla Martin, ranked sixth in the world. Martin beat Indonesia's Meiluawaty 11-4 10-12 11-3.</p>
<p>Audina relied on an aggressive style and a devastating cross-court drop shot to dominate Julien. In the second game, Audina scored 10 consecutive points on her first service, with most of the points coming off cross-court drops and smashes.</p>
<p>&quot;She attacks a lot,&quot; Julien said. &quot;She goes for winners almost all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>The two-time Canadian Olympian also said she was impressed with Audina's agility and court sense.</p>
<p>&quot;She always knew when I was going to the opening,&quot; Julien said. &quot;She could see my drops coming. Usually, opponents hold back but she was really quick in getting there.&quot;</p>
<p>Two of the world's top three male players will meet for the men's singles championship. Indonesia's top-seeded Joko Suprianto, who heads the world rankings, meets Denmark's second-seeded, third-ranked Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen.</p>
<p>Both players swept their semifinal opponents. Suprianto beat Taiwan's Fung Permadi 15-6 15-8 and Hoyer-Larsen defeated Malaysia's Rashid Sidek 15-13 15-3.</p>
