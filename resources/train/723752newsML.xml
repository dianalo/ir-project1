<p>Three people died and 37 others, including foreign tourists, were injured in a hotel fire in Thailand's eastern beach resort town of Pattaya, police and hospital sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>One man jumped from the eleventh floor to his death while a man and a woman were burnt to death by flames at the hotel, about 200 km (120 miles) southeast of Bangkok.</p>
<p>The number of dead and injured was expected to keep rising, as many people were apparently trapped inside the building, police said.</p>
<p>Fire-fighters told Reuters by telephone that the fire broke out in the ground floor coffee house of the Royal Jomtien Resort and then spread from the sixth floor to the 12th floor of the 16-storey building.</p>
<p>More than 300 people were in the hotel at the time the fire broke out, mostly Thais who were attending three different seminars.</p>
<p>As a thick smoke billowed into the air, several people could be seen trapped on the top floor of the hotel building. Three helicopters were aiding firefighters and airlifting people to safety, live television broadcasts showed.</p>
<p>Two of the 32 injured were rushed to a nearby hospital with serious burns, hospital sources said.</p>
