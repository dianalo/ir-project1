<headline>RTRS-Caltex says second half gains eroded.</headline>

<p>Caltex Australia Ltd on Wednesday reported a 35 percent rise in its full year net profit for calendar 1996 against 1995, but said gains had been eroded by outside factors in the second half.</p>
<p>Caltex, which jointly owns petrol refiner Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd (Ampol) with Pioneer International Ltd, reported a net profit for 1996 of A$57.70 million.</p>
<p>Chairman Malcolm Irving told a briefing the profit reflected A$52.4 million from Ampol and A$10.6 million from the sale of a stake in the Bayswater colliery in New South Wales.  </p>
<p>It also included a A$3.0 million loss on Bayswater's operations and a A$2.4 million loss from closing out interest rate swaps. Irving said Ampol's second half result fell sharply on the first half, although the refiner lifted 1996 calendar year net profit to A$104.86 million from A$93.35 million.</p>
<p>Second half earnings were A$38.6 million, compared with a first half result near A$70 million, he said.</p>
<p>Irving said efficiency measures had brought significant cost savings, but gains had been eroded by a fall in Singapore refiner margins due to new refinery capacity.  </p>
<p>This resulted in surplus production of petrol, while increased demand for light crudes led to physical supply difficulties.</p>
<p>&quot;This combination of factors had a severe effect on margins and revenues, particularly in the second half of the year,&quot; Caltex said.</p>
<p>Ampol managing director Ian Blackburne said operating costs fell by A$43 million in 1996 on the previous year, while Ampol sold A$51 million worth of assets.  </p>
<p>&quot;All in all, there has been a very significant improvement in the underlying performance...offset in part by external factors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blackburne said he expected to make a further A$20 million in cost reductions in 1997.</p>
<p>He expected Singapore petrol refiner margins to improve gradually during the current half and probably continue to improve in the second half.</p>
<p>&quot;I think, though, we shouldn't expect full year refining margins to be much higher than they were in 1996,&quot; he said.</p>
