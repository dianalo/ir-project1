<headline>Cambodia's new PM says king approves government.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1997-08-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cambodia's newly appointed First Prime Minister Ung Huot said on Thursday that King Norodom Sihanouk had given his blessing to Phnom Penh's new government during a meeting in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;The king gave us his blessing,&quot; Ung Huot told reporters at the Phnom Penh airport upon his return from Beijing, where he and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen met Sihanouk to seek his approval for their government in the wake of the July 6 overthrow of the king's son.  </p>
<p>Ung Huot showed reporters a copy of a news agency report that had been annotated by Sihanouk. Next to a section of the report that said the visiting Cambodian delegation had come to seek the king's blessing, the monarch had written: &quot;At lunch, I toasted their health.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That means the king already gives his blessing,&quot; said Ung Huot, pointing to Sihanouk's handwritten note.</p>
<p>Political analysts in Phnom Penh said the king's approval was the last hurdle facing Hun Sen in his bid to legitimise his July 6 ouster of his former co-premier and Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
<p>The monarch met Hun Sen and Ung Huot in Beijing on Tuesday. At the meeting, Hun Sen refused Sihanouk's offer to abdicate the throne, the king said on Wednesday. The monarch said he also asked Hun Sen to pursue peace but did not say whether he had given his blessing to the new government.</p>
