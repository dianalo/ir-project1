<p>Poland's air carrier LOT, whose privatisation has been repeatedly delayed, plunged into the red last year but plans to expand and mulls floating a minority stake or issuing convertible bonds, LOT said on Friday.</p>
<p>Unfavourable exchange rates between the zloty and foreign currencies, growing jet fuel prices and debt repayment pushed the company into the red, LOT said in a statement.</p>
<p>LOT spokesman Leszek Chorzewski said that according to unaudited results the company's 1996 net loss was nearly 41 million zlotys ($13.1 million) compared with a 4.2 million net profit in 1995.</p>
<p>The firm's revenues increased to 1.48 billion zlotys last year from 1.47 billion zlotys in 1995 as the number of its passengers grew by more than 10 percent to 2.03 million.</p>
<p>Despite swings in the firm's financial liquidity due to seasonal factors, LOT has had no problems with meeting its liabilities to the treasury, banks and workers on time for the last two years, the statement said.</p>
<p>The firm, impatient with delays in privatisation which has dragged since 1991, is considering strengthening its capital by floating between 10 and 15 percent of its shares in Poland or issuing bonds convertible into shares abroad, Chorzewski said.</p>
<p>&quot;Studies of various options are underway,&quot; he told Reuters. He said that within some weeks the company would ask the government to give its go-ahead for the plan.</p>
<p>Last year the government, which wants to sell a 49-percent stake of LOT, moved the deadline for the sale to June 30, 1998, from December 31, 1996, saying more studies on the complex process were needed.</p>
<p>The transport ministry had earlier annulled a tender for LOT's privatisation adviser, saying bidders had asked to be paid excessively high fees.</p>
<p>Chorzewski said that despite deteriorating results LOT would go ahead with its investment plans to acquire five Boeing planes this year -- four medium-range 737s and one long-distance 767.</p>
<p>The $250 million loan for the jets, to be extended by Chase Manhattan Bank and Poland's Bank Pekao SA, has recently won a guarantee from Eximbank from the United States, he said.</p>
<p>LOT -- which now has 11 Boeings 737, four 767s and eight turbo-prop ATRs -- will later buy an additional eight Boeing 737s and several long-distance jets, 767s or possibly even the new large 777s, Chorzewski said.</p>
<p>LOT needs the new aircraft to boost the number of its links, notably on lucrative transatlantic routes, to keep pace with competition which is increasing due to liberalisation of international flight regulations, Chorzewski said.</p>
<p>LOT now has to repay loans of some $500 million it took to replace its old Soviet-made aircraft after the 1989 fall of communism, according to Friday's Gazeta Wyborcza daily.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted LOT's deputy president Bazyli Samojlik as saying that the firm's fleet is worth $600 million.</p>
