<p>The Toronto Blue Jays baseball team was embroiled in a racism controversy on Thursday, two days after Major League Baseball honoured Jackie Robinson's breaking of the colour line 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston, the first black manager to win the World Series, has accused some critics in the local media of racism, Toronto newspapers reported.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a couple (of sports writers) who continue to take shots at me for no reason at all. I just wonder if they would take the same shot at me if I was white,&quot; Gaston said in the Toronto Sun.</p>
<p>Gaston's comments were made during an interview with the Sun earlier this week as baseball celebrated Robinson's 1947 breathrough with the old Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>
<p>Gaston has led the Blue Jays for eight years and managed them to back-to-back World Series titles in 1992 and 1993.</p>
<p>But his low-key management style has been criticised by some members of the local media.</p>
<p>Gaston suggested during a pre-game radio show on Tuesday that criticism of his decisions by local broadcaster Bob McCowan and others may be linked to the colour of his skin.</p>
<p>&quot;What else can they be,&quot; Gaston said during show prior to the Blue Jays' game against the Kansas City Royals.</p>
<p>&quot;(Is it) because of your colour or because they just don't like you? How the heck can they not like you when they don't know you,&quot; Gaston said.</p>
<p>McCowan, a broadcaster with The Fan, an all-sports radio station in Toronto, asked the Blue Jays for a meeting with Gaston on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I have said on the air many times that it was possible, maybe probable, that my opinion of him as a manager is clouded by my personal dislike for him. I've willingly acknowledged that I may be biased. But I'm not racist,&quot; McCowan told Toronto's Globe and Mail on Thursday.</p>
