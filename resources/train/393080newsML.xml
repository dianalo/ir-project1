<p>Construction starts on new homes and apartments increased slightly in January, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, partly recovering from a sharp slump in December caused by severe weather.</p>
<p>Total starts rose 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million last month following a revised 11 percent plunge in December.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, January starts were weaker than anticipated by Wall Street analysts, who had forecast a building rate of 1.42 million a year. They were also well below the pace a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Harsh winter weather in much of the country during December, especially in the West, put a damper on homebuilding at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Builders and analysts had anticipated a bounceback at the beginning of this year on the basis of relatively low mortgage rates and strong job growth.</p>
<p>For example, the National Association of Home Builders said on Wednesday that its index of market activity rose moderately in February and said that builders were confident that the market had steadied.</p>
<p>&quot;Much of that confidence is based on the low, favourable and steady interest rates that buyers have been enjoying for several months now,&quot; said Kent Colton, the association's executive vice president.</p>
<p>But the building sector's performance in January was mixed.</p>
<p>Construction starts on single-family homes gained 10.2 percent last month to a rate of 1.11 million a year after dropping 11.3 percent in December.</p>
<p>However, starts on aprtments plummeted 23.9 percent to 242,000 a year in January after a 9.9 percent drop in December.</p>
<p>Regionally in January, starts in the West climbed 29.8 percent to a rate of 344,000 a year, more than recovering from a 25.6 percent decline in december.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, starts shot up 22.2 percent to a rate of 165,000 a year, the strongest building rate since 176,000 in November 1994.</p>
<p>But in the Midwest, January starts fell sharply by 13.2 percent to 256,000 a year and in the South they were down 6.8 percent to 585,000 a year.</p>
<p>New applications for building permits eased down 1.9 percent to 1.395 million a year during January after a slim 0.3 percent gain in December, indicating the construction activity may be muted in coming months.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said that December building starts had fallen 12.2 percent to a rate of 1.329 million a year but it revised that estimate upward.</p>
<p>The January starts rate was 6.5 percent lower than a year earlier, in January 1996, when new homes and apartments were being built at a rate of 1.444 million a year.</p>
<p>Interest rates remain relatively low by historical standards and have actually eased in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, said rates for a 30-year loan averaged 7.65 percent in the week ending Feb. 14, down from 7.74 percent last week. The rate was the lowest since 7.64 percent in the week ended Dec. 27.</p>
