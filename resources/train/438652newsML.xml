<headline>SOCCER SHOWCASE-DANE AND SCOT UNITE IN OLD FIRM APPRECIATION.</headline>
<dateline>GLASGOW 1997-03-13</dateline>

<p>You don't need to have been born in Scotland like Celtic's Paul McStay to know what is at stake when Rangers clash with Celtic in an &quot;Old Firm&quot; derby.</p>
<p>You can ask a soccer nomad like Dane Brian Laudrup of Rangers and get the same answer.</p>
<p>The two men might be rivals on the field, and have had totally different career patterns, but they are both agreed on one thing -- there is no bigger club rivalry in world soccer.</p>
<p>McStay, now 32, who made his debut for Celtic, his only club, while he was still a teenager in 1982, was almost pre-destined to play at Parkhead and knew all about the Old Firm rivalry from a very young age.</p>
<p>&quot;I became aware that Celtic had a great history almost from the moment I was old enough to kick a ball,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In my own case there was extra spice in the tale because two of the club's most distinguished servants during the first half of this century were relations of mine -- my great-great uncles Willie and Jimmy McStay.&quot;</p>
<p>While McStay, who has played more than 500 matches for Celtic and in countless Old Firm derbies, grew up steeped in Scottish soccer culture, Laudrup is equally bound up in the emotional pull of the fixture.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Danish forward has now appeared in a dozen Old Firm derbies and says that losing one is as bad as it gets in football.</p>
<p>&quot;It's almost like a death in the family,&quot; he said. &quot;In my first season at Rangers we lost 2-0 at home and then we lost 3-0 away. It was unbearable and so was the Cup defeat to Celtic last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I have played for Milan against Internazionale in front of 85,000 fans in Italy. The whole city comes to a standstill when those teams meet but it is tame compared with what goes on in Glasgow.&quot;</p>
<p>Laudrup is enjoying one of the best spells of his career which began with Brondby in the mid-Eighties and has included moves to Bayer Uerdingen and Bayern Munich in Germany and Fiorentina and Milan in Italy.</p>
<p>He came to Rangers before the start of the 1994-95 season and is now looking for a third Scottish league title to add to the Danish championships he won in 1987 and 1988 and the serie A winners' medal he picked up with Milan in 1994.</p>
<p>He made such an impression in his debut season in Glasgow that he was the first overseas player to be voted Scottish Footballer of the Year (1995) and continues to play a vital role for Rangers operating on either flank or in the centre of the attack.</p>
<p>While Laudrup has been instrumental in Rangers' recent successes, McStay has had his share of glory at Parkhead and captained the side to victory in the Scottish Cup final in 1995 as well being a key player in the &quot;double&quot; winning team of 1988.</p>
<p>It does not appear to matter that Sunday's match could feature players from as far afield as Italy, Portugal, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark and England.</p>
<p>If anything they add to the fixture, turning what is essentially a Scottish feud into the international attraction its passionate nature fully deserves.</p>
