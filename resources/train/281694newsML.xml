<headline>U.S. West spot power flat ahead of holiday.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1996-12-31</dateline>

<p>Western U.S. spot electricity prices were quoted notionally in line with Monday levels since daily scheduling through Thursday was finished at the beginning of the week, market sources said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders noted that abundant hydroelectric supplies, despite some flood control constraints in the Pacific Northwest, were putting downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is pressure on backing thermals off,&quot; said one trader. No thermal generation units have been completely shut due to the market, but many plants are cycling down during off-peak hours, he added.</p>
<p>Firm, peak electricity at the California-Oregon border (COB) for Thursday was quoted at $13.50-14.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), while off-peak was bid as low as $8.00.</p>
<p>Thursday firm, peak power at Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) was quoted at $13.00-$15.00, while off-peak was quoted at $9.50-11.50.</p>
<p>Firm, peak Palo Verde (PV) electricity for Thursday was quoted at $13.00-14.50, while off-peak was at $8.00-9.00.</p>
<p>Thursday firm, peak prices at Four Corners were quoted at $13.00-15.00, with off-peak at $8.00-9.00.</p>
