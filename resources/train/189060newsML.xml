<p>Institutional investors pushed Egyptian share prices higher on Thursday with cement and milling firms leading the rise, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index rose 0.6 points to 241.65 in busy trading. Volume was 46.19 million pounds ($13.58 million).</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was active today, and demand came mostly from both local and foreign funds,&quot; said Walid el-Kholi of El-Rashad Securities Brokerage.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were trading large chunks of shares in Alexandria Portland Cement and Egyptian Portland Tora Cement.</p>
<p>A new production process which will increase Alexandria Cement's output by one million tonnes annually pushed share prices 14 percent higher to close at 57.00 pounds. Foreign investor interest in Tora Cement raised the company's share 1.49 pounds to 67.00.</p>
<p>East Delta Flour Mills was the day's most active share, rising 0.51 pounds to 40.50 in trading worth more than 2.0 million pounds.</p>
<p>Rumours that Upper Egypt Flour Mills will increase its dividends for financial 1995/96 which ended on June 30 by one pound to about 4.8 pounds stirred trading in the stock, brokers said.</p>
<p>Shares rose 0.05 pounds to 51.05 pounds in trade worth more than one million pounds.</p>
<p>Helwan Portland Cement, which announced it would distribute a five pound dividend for 1995/96, rose 0.50 to 53.01 pounds. The firm also said it had increased profits by 21 percent to 125.52 million pounds.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms fell to 360.21 points from 360.31 points on Wednesday and the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 170.82 from 170.12.</p>
<p>Advancers outnumbered declines by 26 to 12.</p>
