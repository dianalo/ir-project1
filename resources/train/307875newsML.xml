<p>New York City's Finance Commissioner said Wednesday real estate prices were starting to rebound, with the market value for taxable property gaining 1.5 percent to $298.8 billion over last year.</p>
<p>Market values are the starting point for setting the value of the city's taxable real estate, said Fred Cerullo, the finance commissioner, adding the &quot;billable assessed valuation&quot; for the city was preliminarily set at $76.3 billion, a 1.09 percent rise over the previous year.  </p>
<p>Real estate values are a major factor affecting the city's capital program because its debt ceiling, set by the state legislature, is based on a five-year average of these prices.</p>
<p>New York City's debt ceiling was expected to fall to under $31 billion over the next few months, and it is expected to run out of borrowing room by the end of its 1997 fiscal year, as using the five-year average slows down the impact of drops or rises in the real estate market.</p>
<p>The city has proposed a new infrastructure authority to issue debt for education and transportation as a way of sidestepping the debt cap, but the legislature failed to approve the measure at a special session in late December.</p>
<p>Cerullo, in prepared remarks, said &quot;While property values have not rebounded to the boom levels of the 1980s real estate market, we are beginning to see a slow, but steady growth trend in overall property values.&quot; He singled out the hotels as the leading sector, gaining 10 percent as tourism grew, and noted that in a sharp reversal over last year's slip, residential apartment buidings rose 2.55 percent. And Manhattan units rose 3.6 percent as the luxury market boomed.</p>
