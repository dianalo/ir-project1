<p>Asian stocks are likely to put in a mixed performance over the coming week, torn between strength in U.S. financial markets and negative local factors, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Markets are very confused,&quot; said one fund manager. &quot;They're taking their cue from the (U.S.) bond market, which seems quite relaxed about the economy. But Asia has its own cycle to worry about. We've got disinflation and high real interest rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Friday's rally in U.S. financial markets could support some of the better-performing Asian indices, particularly those with a strong link to the United States through currency pegs, the analysts said.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 94.72 points or 1.36 percent higher at 7071.20 on Friday after U.S. economic data cooled expectations of another interest rate increase at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on May 20.</p>
<p>U.S. bonds also rallied, cheered by news that a balanced budget agreement had been reached. The benchmark long bond yield was trading at 6.88 percent late on Friday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong was the Asian market most likely to gain from U.S. strength, and Tokyo also appeared poised for strength as pension funds continued powering the key Nikkei 225 index higher, the analysts said.</p>
<p>But the generally negative tone in Asia was expected to continue dragging some of the smaller markets lower, even though a number of analysts are betting on a technical rebound, after recent steep losses.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these markets are looking very oversold technically,&quot; the fund manager said, referring to Manila's 20-percent slide since January.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a bounce, but I think there is still a questioning of the Asian story by institutional investors, many of whom are still overweight so if there is a rally people will be selling into it,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks are likely to extend gains in the coming week, propelled by more buying by pension funds and other domestic institutional investors after their return on Tuesday from a long weekend, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent rise has been so sudden that market participants are beginning to feel afraid of being left behind,&quot; said Nobuhiro Kaneda, general manager at Daiwa Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>On Friday, due to a wave of pension-driven purchases, the 225-share Nikkei average rose 239.42 points or 1.24 percent to end at 19,514.75, jumping above the previous closing high for 1997 of 19,446.00 set on January 6, the first trading day of year.</p>
<p>The last time the benchmark index closed above the 19,500 hurdle was on Christmas day, when it ended at 19,549.41.</p>
<p>For the week, the index ended 901.89 points, or 4.85 percent, higher.</p>
<p>In the first month of the new business year which started on April 1, the benchmark has risen nearly eight percent.</p>
<p>Brokers said Wall Street's rally and a gradual shift into stocks from bonds on the back of low domestic interest rates have also been supportive factors. But fund managers at major life insurers say their purchases have contributed greatly to supporting the Nikkei average.</p>
<p>The next technical target for the barometer is the half-way retracement point between the June 1996 high and the January 1997 low which is seen at 19,985.22, they said. After that would be the 20,000 threshold.</p>

<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks should continue climbing in the week ahead, powered by a strong Wall Street and hopes of a pick-up in the local real estate market, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index broke above 13,000 points last week for the first since mid-March and over the week recorded a gain of 435.94 points, or 3.45 percent, to close at 13,081.70 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment has swung back to optimism now,&quot; said Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International.</p>
<p>&quot;Fears of a (U.S.) interest rate hike have already subsided. Also the property market is showing signs of recovering from the past month's lacklustre performance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the surge in the Dow industrials on Friday should give the local market a strong boost early in the week.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index could test 13,400 points over the course of the week, they said.</p>

<p>TAIPEI - Taiwan share prices are expected to continue their downward correction in the coming week, with investors lacking confidence in the market's potential for gains due to concerns that many share prices are overvalued, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market, which has been one of the world's strongest performers so far this year, sank four percent, or more than 300 points, in the week beginning April 28.</p>
<p>The decline included a stunning 298.66-point plunge on Friday despite a report that the combined net profit of listed firms had surged a year-on-year 43 percent in the first quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that the profits are bad, but that the market had anticipated unrealistic profit levels and soared according to that anticipation,&quot; said Allen Huang, analyst for National Securities.</p>
<p>The index had risen by 27 percent in 1997 before last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The downward correction will continue in the next week,&quot; Huang said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the index rebounded to finish 127.67 points or 1.56 percent higher at 8,314.67. It closed at 8,661.72 a week earlier. A 8,000-8,400 range was seen for the week ahead.</p>
<p>The government was expected to announce the April inflation figure on Monday and April trade data on Wednesday.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>MANILA - Further weakness is expected for Manila's main stock market index after weak corporate earnings and concerns about the health of the property market sparked a savage nine-percent sell-off last week, traders said.</p>
<p>The main index closed lower for the sixth straight session on Friday, falling by 42.52 points to 2,605.65. Week-on-week, the index lost 266.72 points, or 9.29 percent, from the previous week's 2,872.37 points.</p>
<p>Manila's main stock market index will likely test the key support level of 2,600 points in the next week on an expected dearth of positive news, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the index breaks 2,600, then we will test the next target of 2,400,&quot; said Raul Ruiz, vice-president at Sun Hung Kai Securities Phils Inc.</p>
<p>Traders said April inflation figures, due in the coming week, were unlikely to encourage any buying.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia stocks are expected to gain in the coming week, supported by Friday's rise on Wall Street, but sentiment remains nervous, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;This rise in the Dow Jones could actually help to sustain a little bit the gains made on Friday,&quot; said Faez Khairuddin, head of research at SJ Securities. &quot;We have been saying before that the rise was not sustainable because of no follow-through support,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Sentiment will continue to be skittish due to large numbers of &quot;stale bulls&quot;, those who had bought at much higher levels, and were waiting to sell when a firm recovery took place, traders said.</p>
<p>For the holiday-shortened week, the Composite Index of 100 capitalised stocks closed at 1097.96, 8.51 points or 0.78 percent higher on Friday, from a week ago. The market was closed on Thursday for the Labour Day holiday.</p>

<p>BANGKOK - Thai stocks are expected to rally slightly in the week ahead as the market reacts to a recent 25-basis point cut in Thai bank lending rates and signs of improving exports, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite SET index retreated 3.49 percent during the week to close at 660.10 on Friday, down 1.19 points on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The Thai interest rate cut, along with improved export figures released by the customs department earlier (last) week, will likely spur sentiment next week,&quot; said Thanadech Mahapokai, assistant vice president of Book Club Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>The department estimated March exports at 133 billion baht against 113.2 billion in February.</p>
<p>Brokers said turnover would remain thin next week due to the Coronation Day holiday on Monday.</p>

<p>SEOUL - Seoul stocks are expected to rise in the week ahead in active trading as a foreign stockholding limit expansion helped to increase liquidity, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said some 500 billion won would flow in by the next week with the expansion. The ceiling on foreign stock holdings in individual companies was raised to 23 percent from 20 percent last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will benefit from the foreign stock ownership expansion,&quot; said Koh Kyong-bae of Hyundai Securities. &quot;The index would test the 740 level next week.&quot;</p>
<p>The composite stock index ended at 704.87 on Saturday, up 5.11 points or 0.73 percent from 699.76 last Saturday.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE - Some upside was seen for Singapore shares in the coming week after Wall Street surged on Friday on economic data which raised doubts about the prospect of another U.S. interest rate hike in May, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The interest rate rise predicted for May could now seem unnecessary and I think we'll see some foreign bargain hunting, particularly in property stocks, as a result,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Singapore shares have seen downward pressure in recent weeks, but ended firmer on Friday on bargain hunting.</p>
<p>The key Straits Times Industrials Index ended up 11.97 at 2,016.23 on Friday, 3.37 points or 0.17 percent lower from last week's close of 2,019.60.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares were likely to be well supported in the near term with the consolidation of last week set to continue, traders said.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,491.6 on Friday, up 0.25 percent or 6.2 points from Thursday and 0.7 percent up over the week. However, the index has slipped from its record high of 2,515.1 reached on April 30.</p>
<p>While positive Wall Street sentiment would help, the market was now more focused on local fundamentals, moderating the impact of any U.S. moves, market players said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market hasn't gone crazy at any time and there is enough in the market to keep it interesting,&quot; said Andrew Sekely, head of equities at Intersuisse.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>WELLINGTON - New Zealand share prices are expected to push higher in the week ahead if the current trend of a market-led easing of monetary conditions continues, brokers said.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended the week 11.42 points up from Thursday's close at 2,277.53, or a 23.96-point (1.06 percent) improvement from last week's close of 2,253.57.</p>
<p>Tim Koller at Merrill Lynch said the rally in interest rate markets and the lower New Zealand dollar sparked the gain.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be optimism on the local front, tempered slightly by the prospect of overseas volatility,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do get an endorsement of the easing so far by the Reserve Bank, and if they were to surmise that it could go further, then certainly that is going to give our equities a boost,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>BOMBAY - Indian shares are seen lower in the coming week as players await a possible oil price hike and new developments in a corruption scandal that has unsettled the 11-day old coalition government, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook is dull, weak and pessimistic,&quot; said Sanjeev Choithani, chief dealer at brokers Pashupati Advani.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no good news to look forward to.&quot;</p>
<p>Bombay's top 30-share index fell 39.40 points or 1.03 percent to 3,801.71 on Friday. Profit-taking erased the sharp gains made after the return of former finance minister P. Chidambaram to the government last week, dealers said.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>DHAKA - Share prices on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) are likely to fluctuate in the week starting on Saturday amid continued unease over banking sector problems, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said investors were still nervous, despite the DSE index's gain over the last two trading days of last week, following a week-long bear run after the central bank chief's recent remarks that the banking system was on the verge of collapse due to bad debts.</p>
<p>The DSE index lost 64.72 points to close at 957.48 in the week to Wednesday. The market was closed for a public holiday on Thursday and Friday is the weekend in Moslem Bangladesh.</p>
