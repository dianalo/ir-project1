<headline>NFL AMERICAN FOOTBALL-RAVENS RB BAM MORRIS SUSPENDED FOR FOUR GAMES BY NFL.</headline>

<p>Baltimore Ravens running back Bam Morris was suspended for the first four games of the season by the National Football League Wednesday for violating the league's substance abuse policy.</p>
<p>The sanction was the second suspension for Morris, who has been in the league's substance abuse programme since pleading guilty to a marijuana possession charge last year.</p>
<p>Various reports claimed that Morris, 25, failed a mandatory drug test several months ago, and learned last week that he had lost his appeal, but the league would not discuss details of the violation.</p>
<p>Morris, the team's leading rusher last season, will be allowed to practice with the club until his suspension begins the first week of the regular season. He will be eligible to return to the roster September 22 and will be permitted to play September 28 at San Diego.</p>
<p>&quot;There is concern for Bam from all of us,&quot; said Ravens head coach Ted Marchibroda. &quot;At the same time, he let his teammates and our fans down.&quot;</p>
<p>Morris last year pleaded guilty to a felony marijuana possession charge after he was arrested in Rockwall, Texas with more than five pounds (2.2 kg) of marijuana in his car.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe in the NFL rules and regulations, and the league has found Bam in violation,&quot; Ravens owner Art Modell said. &quot;We stand ready to have Bam return to the team providing he continues to adhere to his rehabilitation process, and he maintains a strict conditioning programme.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ravens signed Morris to a two-year contract last September, two months after he was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>In 1996, he led the Ravens with 737 yards rushing on 172 carries and four touchdowns. He also had 25 receptions for 242 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>Morris, who played for the Steelers in their Super Bowl XXX loss to Dallas in 1995, had five carries for 17 yards in the Ravens' exhibition opener, a 21-20 loss to the New York Giants last Saturday.</p>
