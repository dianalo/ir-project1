<headline>BA attacks French in Air Algerie security row.</headline>

<p>British Airways Plc on Thursday accused French authorities of blocking its attempts to boost security at Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris, which last week allowed the carrier of violence-torn Algeria to resume flights.</p>
<p>Air Algerie -- seen as a target for Islamic guerrillas -- now has check-in desks close to those of British Airways. BA says this is unsafe and wants to transfer all its Paris flights to Orly airport, south of the French capital.</p>
<p>But officials at the Paris airport authority say the request is unlikely to be granted and insist the security arrangements for Air Algerie are adequate.</p>
<p>&quot;So far every time we do something to protect the safety of our passengers the French authorities object and what mystifies us is what their motivation is,&quot; BA chief executive Robert Ayling told BBC radio.</p>
<p>He said he could not understand why the airport authority had not obliged Air Algerie to move to a remote terminal to boost security. The airline suspended flights to Paris two years ago after being forced to use the terminal.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, the answer they have given that (this) is for technical reasons is clearly not satisfactory and clearly doesn't answer the question,&quot; Ayling said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concerned at the moment that (the security arrangements at Charles de Gaulle) are not adequate. They are not the same as the arrangements (made) for Air Algerie at other French airports. Our concern is to protect our passengers and staff.&quot;</p>
<p>French authorities said on Wednesday they had not received the BA request to move service to Orly, adding that the airline itself was a target for guerrillas from the Irish Republican Army.</p>
