<headline>Swedish shares dip as Ericsson falls after result.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1997-02-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swedish share prices closed marginally down on Tuesday following a bumpy session as the market reacted after telecommunications group Ericsson's 1996 results.</p>
<p>Ericsson closed down four crowns at 248 after posting a 33 percent jump in pre-tax profits for 1996. The share had fallen 2.5 crowns ahead of the result and was seen remaining volatile.</p>
<p>&quot;People were long in the share before the report so there is no real upside,&quot; one Stockholm trader said. &quot;But there was nothing negative in the report and the share price could swing several times later today.&quot;</p>
<p>The result was a touch higher than market expectations.</p>
<p>Drug group Astra counterbalanced some of the fall by fellow blue-chip Ericsson and closed 2.5 crowns higher at 357.5, shrugging off a drug sector fall in New York overnight.</p>
<p>The forestry sector index rose 1.16 percent, outshining other sectors.</p>
<p>One dealer said the session demonstrated the market's underlying strength.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows just how strong the market really is -- despite a fall in New York last night and in Ericsson, the market is resisting well,&quot; one chief dealer said.</p>
