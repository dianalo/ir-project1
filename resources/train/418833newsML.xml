<p>Residents of Istanbul's Fatih district, stronghold of the ruling Islamist Welfare Party, quietly vented their anger on Tuesday at army warnings to end a recent surge of religious activism sweeping Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way they can do this. The soldiers should look to military matters and the politicians to politics,&quot; said one trader, Abdurrahman, 46.</p>
<p>The generals have ordered Welfare's leader, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, to crack down on religious radicalism and abandon proposed legislation liberalising the country's laws on religious dress.</p>
<p>Outside the main mosque in Fatih, traders sold combs, scents and mirrors, catering to the many Koran students in the area, some of whose schools the military wants to close.</p>
<p>&quot;The Kafirs (non-believers) say out in the open, 'I'm a communist', or 'I drink wine'. Why can't we be free to live as Moslems, without the army interfering?&quot; said Yunus, 19, a trainee imam (prayer leader).</p>
<p>He sat on a park bench next to a young woman covering her face and dressed head to foot in the black Islamic chador. Like others, Yunus declined to give his surname.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is going well right now, I don't see why they have to interfere with things.&quot;</p>
<p>Erbakan leads a coalition with the pro-Western True Path Party. He has embarked on a number of Islamist initiatives in recent weeks that have angered the strictly secularist military.</p>
<p>These include the proposed construction of mosques in secularist strongholds, a lifting of the ban on women wearing of Islamic headscarves in government workplaces and a controversial rapprochement with eastern neighbour Iran.</p>
<p>But such policies go down well with the party faithful who refer to 70-year-old engineer Erbakan affectionately as &quot;Hoca&quot;, or Teacher.</p>
<p>&quot;Erbakan has done as well as the most intelligent, most capable man in the world could have done. The government is working very well,&quot; said Turgay, a 22-year-old Fatih shopkeeper.</p>
<p>The military has demanded an investigation into the often secretive Islamic brotherhoods, or tarikats, Koran courses and religious-based student hostels which abound in Fatih. They are seen by the army as training grounds for religious extremists.</p>
<p>Islamists counter that such military interference is undemocratic and would not be tolerated in European-style democracies.</p>
<p>&quot;All we want is to be able to dress and behave as we please. If there is any democracy in this country, they shouldn't be telling politicians what to do,&quot; said Abdurrahman, the scent seller.</p>
<p>The army previously mounted military coups to end three civilian governments in 1960, 1971 and 1980 and moved tanks through an Ankara Welfare stronghold last month after an anti-secularist rally.</p>
<p>The 1980 coup was immediately preceded by an Islamist rally led by Erbakan in his stronghold of Konya, in central Anatolia.</p>
<p>&quot;I will break the hand that tries to touch my mother's veil. I will go to jail if necessary,&quot; Hasan Huseyin Ceylan, a Welfare Party MP was quoted as saying in Sabah newspaper.</p>
<p>Others are not so forthright.</p>
<p>&quot;I got into a lot of trouble after 1980, I don't get involved in politics any more, I don't even talk about politics any more,&quot; said Mustafa, as he sold Koranic verses on the streets of Fatih.</p>
<p>&quot;What Allah has written will come true, that's all I know,&quot; he said.</p>
