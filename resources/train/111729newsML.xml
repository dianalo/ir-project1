<p>The EU Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce said on Friday it was concerned a European Parliament Committee risked undermining the rights of trademark holders and consumers in its draft recommendation on the issue of comparative advertising.</p>
<p>At issue is the draft recommendation by the Parliament's consumer affairs committee's on the common position amending the misleading advertising directive to include comparative advertising -- COM (91)147.</p>
<p>&quot;In many countries where it has been allowed, comparative advertising has been easily abused,&quot; the EU Committee said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Hit and run tactics&quot; commonly used in the advertising industry may damage a trademark which the owner has spent time and money making known to the public.&quot;</p>
<p>Comparative advertising is where an advertiser tries to sell a product by comparing itself favourably with another.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Committee said the text proposed by European People's Party deputy Ria Oomen-Ruijten, which is due be put to the next European Parliament plenary session, does not contain the necessary safeguards to prevent the abuse of comparative advertising .</p>
<p>Oomen-Ruijten says that there is no harm in comparative advertising and that in fact it should be encouraged.</p>
<p>The EU Committee said that if there was any doubt as to whether an advertisement was misleading or unfair the interests of the consumer and the company holding the trademark should take priority.</p>
