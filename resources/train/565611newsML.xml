<p>Residents of a rebel-held town east of Zaire's capital reported on Wednesday the deaths of hundreds of civilians and fighters from both sides of the civil war.</p>
<p>The Zairean Red Cross said 10 of its workers were among those killed in the fighting, which began on Sunday night, but would not elaborate on the other casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been in radio contact with Kenge via Bandundu. They confirm the death of 10 of our volunteers and have given us the names of the dead,&quot; a Zairean Red Cross official in Kinshasa told Reuters.</p>
<p>Residents of Kenge, in radio contact with Kinshasa, said at least 200 civilians, 106 government troops and 15 of Laurent Kabila's rebels were killed. A total of 125 people were injured, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were around 200 civilians killed at Kenge...we don't know yet how they were killed,&quot; a humanitarian source in Kinshasa said.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible so many civilians could be killed in crossfire. Church and humanitarian agencies hoped to establish on Thursday whether massacres had taken place.</p>
<p>The residents said the rebels were in control of Kenge, 250 km (150 miles) by road from the capital, on Wednesday after the town of about 20,000 people was briefly captured by President Mobutu Sese Seko's forces on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The only civilian radio working in Kenge -- supplying all the news to the outside world -- was under guard and a soldier of the rebel alliance was monitoring all conversations, a Western security source said.</p>
<p>This meant the details reaching Kinshasa were treated with caution by journalists, particularly the imbalance in government and rebel casualties.</p>
<p>But humanitarian, religious and diplomatic sources were taking seriously the report of one of the heaviest tolls in the seven-month history of Zaire's rebellion.</p>
<p>Mobutu's troops have often retreated from their positions without a fight but the presidential loyalists are now showing signs of real resistance to defend the capital.</p>
<p>Kenge is the nearest frontline town to the capital, which is the next target of the rebels closing in after seizing most of Zaire's territory.</p>
<p>Western security sources say that after initial raids on Kenge, government forces have withdrawn westwards, leaving the town more or less under the control of the rebels.</p>
<p>A military spokesman in Kinshasa said on Tuesday the army was poised to recapture Kikwit, a key town about 250 km (125 miles) east of Kenge, after battles in which he claimed 500 rebels were wiped out.</p>
<p>Kikwit residents contacted by radio on Wednesday said the town was firmly in the hands of the rebels.</p>
<p>Diplomats as well as senior aides to the beleaguered president have indicated that UNITA troops from Angola are fighting alongside elite troops of the presidential guard at Kenge although the scale of the involvement was unclear.</p>
<p>In Angola's 20-year civil war Zaire was a key ally of Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels, providing a conduit for weaponry.</p>
