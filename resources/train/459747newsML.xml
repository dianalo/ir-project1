<headline>ARA bunkers steady, second day of good volumes.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-03-21</dateline>

<p>Rotterdam bunker prices were broadly steady on Friday, another active day, while prices rose slightly in most other European ports.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST bunkers held around $90 fob despite a slight weakening of the barge market. Even so, bunkers were still only about $1 higher than the average barge price.</p>
<p>Suppliers reported the second consecutive day of healthy volumes, reaching around 20,000 tonnes, after almost 30,000 tonnes on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people are buying ahead of Easter. Others simply had to buy to cover delayed requirements,&quot; one supplier said.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were broadly stable, but at around $5 above Rotterdam, failed to attract many buyers.</p>
<p>Mediterranean fuel oil bunkers mostly gained $1 a tonne. Few suppliers reported much business.</p>
<p>Fujairah fuel oil softened by $1/$2. Few ships were fixed as most shipowners believed prices would weaken further at the start of next week.</p>
