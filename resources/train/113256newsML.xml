<p>An attempt by a small German town to give its citizens a taste of the future single European currency failed because coin collectors were more interested in keeping the coins than spending them, the town's mayor said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Waldkirch Mayor Richard Leibinger said the city's 20,000 citizens had little chance to spend the &quot;Euro&quot; that was put into circulation for a two-week period in the small Black Forest town because collectors had hoarded the coins.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't turn out as we had hoped,&quot; Leibinger told Bild am Sonntag newspaper. &quot;Two hours after we started all the coins were gone. We had coin collectors calling from around the world wanting the coins.&quot;</p>
<p>Waldkirch, a picturesque town near Freiburg in southwestern Germany, made available some 6,000 Euro coins, which could be &quot;exchanged&quot; at a local savings bank at the rate of two marks ($1.31) per Euro.</p>
<p>The 1,000 Euro coins with a face value of 25 Euros and the 6,000 3-Euro coins were all snapped up on the first day, Leibinger said. About 50 stores in the town were ready to accept the Euro as a parallel currency to the mark, but never got the chance to make change in Euros. ($1=1.5293 Mark)</p>
