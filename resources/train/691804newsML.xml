<p>Outgoing British Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said on Friday he would need to keep a handkerchief handy for the emotional handover of the colony to China.</p>
<p>Patten, who spent five years battling China over democratic reforms, said there would be a high degree of emotion because when Britain quit other colonies, their people had been left with their independence.</p>
<p>&quot;That's never been an option in Hong Kong,&quot; he said in an interview with Britain's Sky Television news.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happening in Hong Kong is that a free society is rejoining China, which is a society with a different idea of freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>Patten added: &quot;It's going to be a supercharged emotional occasion. I think we had better all keep our handkerchiefs handy.&quot;</p>
<p>He said an important chapter of British history was being closed on June 30, the day of the handover, but it was an exaggeration to say it was the end of the British empire.</p>
<p>&quot;The British empire really ended 30 years ago. This is an extraordinary postscript and a post script which is ending whooly differently from everywhere else.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;The 30th June will be an extremely emotional occasion. If I believed in medicating oneself, maybe it would be a day for Mogadon.&quot;</p>
