<title>UK: UK building society law due before election.</title>

<p>Government legislation which will provide a &quot;level playing field&quot; between mutally-owned building societies and banks is set to be passed by the British parliament before the next election.</p>
<p>The Building Societies Bill, which removes restrictions on the activities of building societies, will be given its first reading on Friday, the government said on Thursday, and is unlikely to be challenged by the opposition Labour Party.</p>
<p>Only &quot;one small area of contention&quot; exists between the two main parties and it is unlikely to delay the enactment of the Bill, Treasury sources said.</p>
<p>Last week the Labour Party called on the government to push ahead with the legislation before it is disrupted by the election, due within the next three months.</p>
<p>Until now building societies have operated on a prescriptive basis. If they wanted to carry out a particular activity, it had to be covered by the Building Societies Act.</p>
<p>That competitive disadvantage has been one factor driving a host of building societies to convert into banks quoted on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>The Halifax, Woolwich, Alliance &amp; Leicester  and Northern Rock Building Societies have all announced plans to shed their mutual status, while the Bristol and West Building Society is to be bought by Bank of Ireland.</p>
<p>The new bill, if passed, may dull the temptation for others in the industry to follow suit.</p>
<p>Under the bill, a building society will also forfeit its five-year immunity from takeover if it took over another financial institution after becoming a bank.</p>
<p>Brian Davis, chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society, which has repeatedly stressed its commitment to retaining its mutual status, welcomed the news, saying it would put them on an equal footing with banks.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very pleased. It means if we need to carry out a particular business activity, we can essentially get on with it without having to say this one isn't written down, can we or can't we do it,&quot; said Davis.</p>
<p>In the short term the new bill is unlikely to spark a rush by building societies into new activities. Many new areas such as general insurance have opened up to them, albeit on a &quot;drip-feed&quot; basis.</p>
<p>But it does allow greater flexibility in planning for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;When you're trying to take a long term view, it's very difficult if you don't know which one you're going to be drip-fed,&quot; Davis told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;For instance if we wanted to be an Internet provider for a wider audience than the Nationwide, theoretically we wouldn't be able to do that under the existing legislation.&quot;</p>
<p>Customers may also benefit if more building societies now decide to remain mutuals, owned by their customers.</p>
<p>Without the need to pay dividends, mutual status allows societies to offer better rates than banks and there was now no business reason to convert, said Davis.</p>
