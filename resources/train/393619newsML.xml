<p>The West and Russia remained far apart on Friday over the bitterly divisive issue of NATO enlargement, despite claims from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that she made &quot;important progress&quot; during talks in Moscow.</p>
<p>With Western efforts to reassure Russia before a NATO summit in July in full swing but short on apparent progress, Poland warned the major powers not to cut any secret deal with Moscow over the terms of alliance's enlargement.</p>
<p>And Romania welcomed French President Jacques Chirac on an official visit, hoping that he would boost the country's slim chances of joining NATO in the first wave -- widely expected to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic.</p>
<p>Albright, on her first foreign tour since taking up the job, emerged from talks with Russian leaders in Moscow to say that she had made &quot;important progress&quot;, although she conceded that difficult work lay ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a serious, constructive exchange, but it is clear we have some complex questions to resolve,&quot; Albright told a joint news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.</p>
<p>Russia fiercely opposes NATO's plans to admit former Warsaw Pact members, saying the move poses a direct threat to its own security.</p>
<p>NATO has said it will not be deterred and plans to issue invitations to several new members at a Madrid summit in July. But the alliance is also trying to reassure Moscow by offering new arms reductions and a special relationship to convince Russia that it wants partnership, not confrontation.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still negatively disposed to NATO expansion but we are also trying to do all possible to minimise the complications that may arise if expansion goes ahead,&quot; said Primakov, who described Albright as &quot;an iron lady but a constructive lady&quot;.</p>
<p>Russian officials appeared to show little interest in Albright's suggestion, made earlier this week, of a new NATO-Russian military unit which would enhance cooperation.</p>
<p>Albright is the latest in a stream of top-level Western visitors who have been carrying the same message to Moscow -- that NATO wants to work with Russia, even though enlargement is going ahead on schedule.</p>
<p>&quot;We are no longer in a situation of you versus us. We are all on the same side,&quot; Albright said.</p>
<p>Primakov is due to visit Brussels for further talks with NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana this weekend as the next stage in the diplomatic battle.</p>
<p>Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz visited alliance headquearters on Friday to give a different message.</p>
<p>He echoed fears, both in Eastern Europe and among some NATO allies, that the United States and other major countries might ignore their concerns and push on with a 19th century-style great power carve-up with Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;In a system of cooperative security, there is no place for geopolitics, spheres of influence, secret protocols or concerts of great powers,&quot; he told NATO ambassadors during a visit to alliance headquarters in Brussels.</p>
<p>A recent French suggestion for a five-nation summit of major powers to discuss the issue of NATO expansion has already made Eastern European nations like Poland uneasy and some Western allies are worried about being left out.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said NATO's dialogue with Moscow should in no way limit the freedom of other countries to shape relations with the alliance as they wished.</p>
<p>Another would-be NATO member, Romania, welcomed French President Jacques Chirac on a state visit on Friday amid hopes that his strong support would help the Balkan state's chances of being included in the first wave of new alliance members.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that France provides our most solid support among NATO member states is already well known,&quot; President Emil Constantinescu told a radio interviewer.</p>
<p>Romania argues that its position on the Black Sea and proximity to Poland and ex-Soviet Ukraine make its inclusion a strategic trump card for NATO and hopes Chirac can persuade Washington to back its rapid admission.</p>
<p>Diplomats say Romania is, however, unlikely to be among the first countries admitted to NATO, probably in 1999.</p>
<p>Albright had come to Moscow armed with proposals aimed at sweetening NATO expansion for the Russians. They included an offer of significant reductions in conventional arms in Europe and a charter defining NATO-Russia relations.</p>
<p>But Russia and the United States differ over the precise nature of this proposed charter, with Washington and other allies holding out against Moscow's calls to make it a legally binding document.</p>
<p>NATO fears that such a document would give Russia an effective veto over the alliance's decision-making.</p>
<p>Albright said discussions on the charter would be put on the &quot;fast-track&quot;. But it was not clear whether any document could be ready by the time of NATO's July summit, far less by next month when U.S. President Bill Clinton and Yeltsin meet in Helsinki.</p>
