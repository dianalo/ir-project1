<title>ZAIRE: Rebels let aid workers assess Zaire refugee needs.</title>
<headline>Rebels let aid workers assess Zaire refugee needs.</headline>
<dateline>BUKAVU, Zaire 1996-11-24</dateline>

<p>Officials from the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on Sunday they had begun assessing the need for aid to refugees in eastern Zaire after finally being allowed access by rebel troops.</p>
<p>&quot;We started today our assessment,&quot; UNHCR spokesman Mans Nyberg told Reuters. &quot;Today they are mainly operating in (the town of) Bukavu but tomorrow they will go elsewhere in the area.&quot;</p>
<p>The rebels agreed on Saturday to allow into Zaire the UNHCR and other relief organisations, who believe hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees who fled their country in 1994 are still in Zaire and badly in need of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>The anti-government rebels say that there are very few refugees left after more than half a million Hutus returned to Rwanda earlier this month.</p>
<p>But the rebel leaders add that scores of displaced Zaireans, victims of the fighting that has raged in the area over the past month, still need help.</p>
<p>The U.N. had been running a refugee relief operation in eastern Zaire until late October when it had to evacuate its workers during bitter fighting between the rebels, Zairean government troops and Rwandan Hutu extremists.</p>
<p>Some representatives of local non-government organisations believe that international aid should not be sent exclusively to Rwandan refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;Their long presence in the region badly affected local living standards,&quot; said Didier de Failly, a local businessman strongly involved in assistance to refugees. &quot;Many local people are really starving.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And most of those blame the refugees for their problems,&quot; he added. &quot;So when distributing aid the United Nations should be really flexible in deciding who is a refugee or a displaced person and who is not. Otherwise unnecessary strains are inevitable.&quot;</p>
