<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares ended their day sharply down on Wednesday, pressured by a weakening dollar after a brief upswing.</p>
<p>Dealers said the dollar fall wiped out gains on the back of far lower than expected U.S. December durable goods orders.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's strength has kept the market going for a while, so reactions were strong when it suddenly fell,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He added he expected retail selling to further pressure the Amsterdam market on Thursday, although he saw firm support for the AEX index at 672.  </p>
<p>&quot;In addition there has been support from the recent launch of several investment funds and from the options market, which helped underpin the index until now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The blue chip index fell 10.55 points to a 672.63 close. The AMX midcap index shed 12.34 points to end at 1016.35.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no more than a healthy correction,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Financials were pressured by the lower bond market and the falling dollar.</p>
<p>ABN Amro ended off 2.30 at 120.00 guilders and ING lost 1.50 to close at 69.10 guilders, while Aegon was minus 2.00 at 117.10 and Amev fell 1.60 to 67.00 guilders.  </p>
<p>Philips lost two guilders to close at 72.20. Dealers blamed the fall on comments Siemens had made about a poor performance of the semiconductor sector.</p>
<p>Baan, which gained four guilders in the morning on better than expected full year 1996 results, could not counter the market and ended the day down 2.00 at 81.00 guilders.</p>
<p>BolsWessanen was the only AEX stock to buck the downtrend, edging up 10 cents to close at 34.10 guilders.  </p>
<p>Dealers attributed the share's buoyancy to takeover speculation, rather than Wednesday's confirmation of its poultry joint venture in Thailand, seen generating sales worth some 180 million guilders this year.</p>
<p>Temporary employment agencies Randstad and Content both fell over three percent. Randstad lost 4.80 guilders to 126.00 and Content slipped 2.70 to 59 guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;With consumer confidence on the rise in the Netherlands, companies could increasingly decide to hire permanent staff instead of temps. Institutionals are selling the stocks,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Midcap Gamma ended 2.30 guilders higher at 95.50 as a newspaper report recapitulating the textile company's recent moves and broker upgrades enticed investors.</p>
<p>IHC Caland continued Tuesday's slide on a disappointing growth forecast, losing 4.8 percent to 107.30 guilders.</p>
<p>Mini-cap software and electronic publishing group AND International pursued its recent mystery rise on heavy turnover, adding over 30 percent to end at 11 guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's on takeover speculation, it's an attractive company. And everybody is for sale if the bid is right,&quot; one dealer guessed.</p>
