<p>*Australian bond futures continued to grind higher during after-hours trading, recovering from their pre-weekend setback, although SYCOM activity was relatively light.</p>
<p>*U.S. Treasury prices were modestly lower as the market braced for the March CPI later on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Australian bond futures contracts continued to grind higher during after-hours trading, recovering from their pre-weekend setback, although SYCOM activity was relatively light.</p>
<p>The June 10-year bond futures contract ended SYCOM at 91.975 compared with Monday's open outcry close of 91.945 and after overcoming resistance at 91.975.</p>
<p>Analysts now see the next barrier at 92.010 before the market can set its sights on last week's 92.080 peak, although some resistance is likely at 92.050, representing the now broken rising channel that start at the beginning of this month.  </p>
<p>This local recovery comes in the face of a negative U.S. Treasury market, which saw further modest price falls on Monday, as the possibility of a further tightening by the Federal Reserve next month continues to weigh on sentiment.</p>
<p>The next main hurdle will be the U.S. CPI later on Tuesday, with the market likely to take particular attention to the core rate after the unexpected jump in the core PPI rate on Friday.</p>
<p>However, the local market is expecting next week's quarterly CPI to be benign. If confirmed, this could stir further thoughts of an easing by the Reserve Bank or at the very least put back any thoughts of a tightening to early next year.  </p>
<p>The short-end of the Australian market took last week's weak labour force report as a sign that the RBA's easing cycle may not be over yet, although it will also need to see subdued outcomes in the quarterly average weekly ordinary time earning report at the start on next month and the &quot;living wage&quot; claim.</p>
<p>There is still no confirmed timing on the verdict by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on the national &quot;living wage&quot; claim.</p>
