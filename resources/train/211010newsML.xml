<p>The New Zealand dollar surged to fresh eight-and-a-half year highs on Friday before easing back towards the close, but dealers said the currency was just marking time before testing higher.</p>
<p>The Kiwi powered past the previous day's high of US$0.7161 to hit 0.7172 in late morning trade. It is at its highest levels since mid-1988.</p>
<p>&quot;Some early buying this morning and some stop-loss buying also from customers that were caught short took us to the highs,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;There are also rumours of very large samurai issues and Asian investor interest out there.&quot;  </p>
<p>Closing at 0.7151/58 and at 67.09 on its Trade-Weighted Index, the Kiwi was up on its 0.7133/40 and 66.87 open having traded a 0.7135-72 range on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall the Kiwi looks in pretty good shape. It's just marking time here at the moment but it's certainly not backing off far and the strength in the Aussie is aslo providing support for it,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think next week we'll test higher -- just how high I'm not sure but somewhere close to towards 72 (U.S.) cents.&quot;  </p>
<p>The currency has strengthened despite signs that a coalation government may soon be formed following inconclusive elections on October 12. New Zealand First, which holds the balance of power, has said it wants to drive the Kiwi lower.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally it's overvalued, but until we get a resolution in the political situation or an easing in monetary conditions, we're not going to see the Kiwi coming off terribly far,&quot; said Phil Lindberg, dealer at Bankers Trust.</p>
<p>He said New Zealand's high real interest rates were still too attractive for offshore investors to leave them alone.  </p>
<p>&quot;You've got to stick with it until we get a resolution in the political situation, until we find out what sort of policies they (the new government) are going to adopt,&quot; Lindberg said.</p>
<p>&quot;You really can't do anything else -- you're going to get carved up by being short because of the cost of high interest rates. That's what's really driving it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kiwi was seen trading a 0.7135-75 range over the weekend. -- Matthew Brockett (64 4) 473 4746</p>
