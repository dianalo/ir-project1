<p>Wicketkeeper Ian Healy returned to torment West Indies as Australia fought back from the loss of five wickets on the opening day of the second test on Friday.</p>
<p>Healy, who scored an unbeaten 161 and 45 not out in Australia's win by 123 runs in the first test in Brisbane on Tuesday, frustrated West Indies once again in a vital, unbroken 93-run partnership with all-rounder Greg Blewett.</p>
<p>At close of play, Australia were 224 for five in 90 overs after captain Mark Taylor won the toss on a slow wicket at the Sydney Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>Healy, who came to the wicket with Australia struggling on 131 for five, finished the day on 44 not out, diminishing the impact of West Indies' early dominance.</p>
<p>Australia's vice-captain received staunch support from Blewett, who contributed an unbeaten 58.</p>
<p>Blewett, recalled into Australia's middle order after Steve Waugh pulled out with a groin injury, proved a more than adequate replacement with an assured innings lasting 210 minutes.</p>
<p>West Indies struggled early on with the new ball but their fortunes were transformed when captain Courtney Walsh introduced fellow fast bowler Ian Bishop after one hour of play.</p>
<p>Taylor and fellow opener Matthew Elliott had advanced with little difficulty to 54 without loss before Bishop struck with his second ball.</p>
<p>He lured Elliott into a indecisive defensive shot outside his off stump with his score on 29 and Brian Lara took the catch off the outside edge at first slip.</p>
<p>Taylor returned to the pavilion for 27 shortly after when he drove a full-length delivery from Biship to Chanderpaul at short cover.</p>
<p>Walsh performed a similar feat to remove Ricky Ponting and Mark Waugh cheaply during the afternoon session to put the tourists temporarily in command.</p>
<p>When Michael Bevan was dismissed for 16 by fast bowler Kenneth Benjamin in the first over after tea, Australia were precariously poised but Healy and Blewett proved equal to the task of rescuing their side.</p>
<p>Blewett enjoyed a reprieve on 32 when he edged a delivery from Benjamin to Lara at first slip but the West Indies vice-captain dropped the catch despite a desperate to grab the ball at the second attempt.</p>
<p>The West Indies' growing frustration was heightened just before the close when Robert Samuels dropped a difficult chance at square leg after Blewett hooked a short ball from Walsh.</p>
