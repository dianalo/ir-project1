<p>An Afghan opposition faction said on Tuesday its forces had repelled counter-attacks by the Taleban Islamic militia north of the capital Kabul without losing any ground.</p>
<p>The statement by a spokesman for former government miliary commander Ahmad Shah Masood seemed to contradict reports by the Taleban government in Kabul on Monday that it had retaken some of the strategic positions lost to the opposition recently.</p>
<p>The Taleban tried to counter-attack at three points along the front around Kabul in the past 24 hours, Masood's spokesman told reporters on Monday morning in the northern opposition-held town of Mazar-i-Sharif.</p>
<p>&quot;Each time our forces beat them back and we did not lose any ground,&quot; he said. &quot;The Taleban forces suffered heavy casualties in their attacks.&quot;</p>
<p>Both sides sides exchanged rocket and artillery fire some 12 miles (20 km) north of Kabul on Monday, witnesses in the area said.</p>
<p>A broadcast by Kabul's Taleban-controlled Radio Shariat said on Monday night that Taleban forces had inflicted heavy losses and damage on the opposition forces in a clean-up operation.</p>
<p>&quot;During this successful operation, strategic points were taken away from the (opposition) militias around Kalakkan (village in Kabul province) and Bagram (air base in nearby Parwan province),&quot; said the broadcast monitored in the Pakistani capital Islamabad.</p>
<p>The Taleban forces are dug in at the same place where they stopped an opposition advance last October. But analysts in Kabul say there has been a change in the relative strengths of the warring factions since then.</p>
