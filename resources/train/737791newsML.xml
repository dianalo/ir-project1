<text>
<p>Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya did not ask for new support from Japanese banks during his meeting with representatives of Japanese commercial banks on Thursday, bank officials who attended the meeting told reporters.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was no new request for help. No talk of a package. He just said that he hoped Japan will continue its support as always,&quot; said an official with a Japanese city bank.  </p>
<p>But Thanong separately said in a speech delivered to the Japan Federation of Bankers' Associations that Thailand will ask Japan to join in any international support scheme if it calls for one.</p>
<p>&quot;We ask that Japanese banks will continue to sustain and increase the credit lines extended to Thai borrowers, both financial and corporate,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;We ask you to join when the kingdom calls for public support through international syndications, both public and private.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanong, along with Bank of Thailand Governor Rerngchai Marakanond, arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for a visit until Friday.</p>
<p>Rerngchai will meet Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita on Thursday afternoon, while Thanong is scheduled to meet Japanese Finance Minster Hiroshi Mitsuzuka on Friday.</p>
<p>The two Thai officials are expected to discuss with Japanese officials the situation after the de facto devaluation of the Thai baht earlier this month.</p>
