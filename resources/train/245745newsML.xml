<p>This is how major world bond markets were trading in late European business on Tuesday.</p>
<p>GERMANY - Bunds, futures pulled lower as U.S. Treasuries start trade weaker but March future holds above support around 100.61 with the market seen hovering ahead of U.S. data later in week. The March Bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) was trading at 100.77, down 0.01 from Monday's settlement price.</p>
<p>BRITAIN - Gilt futures locked healthy gains, outperforming Bunds and U.S. bonds, but traders said gilts making up lost ground rather than starting new trend. Monetary meeting on Wednesday could spur rally at short end if rates left unchanged. The March long gilt future on LIFFE was trading at 110-04/32, up 17/32 from Monday's settlement price.</p>
<p>FRANCE - French bond futures edged higher, helped by a positive start in Germany, but traders said there was little to push the market higher independently and prudence remained the order of the day after Friday's shakeout. The December notional bond future on the MATIF in Paris settled at 128.70, down 0.24 from Monday's settlement price.</p>
<p>ITALY - Italian bond futures changed course after racing ahead early as many other bonds markets including Bunds and Treasuries turned tail. Dealers said that there was some nervousness ahead of the Dublin EU summit at the weekend and after EU leaders made little progress on an EMU stability pact. The March bond future on LIFFE was trading at 128.35, down 0.19 from Monday's settlement price.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - U.S. Treasuries retain modest losses in mid-morning trading. Activity said very light but volatile. The March Treasury bond future on the Chicago Board of Trade was trading at 114-121/32, down 02/32 from Monday's settlement price. The long bond was quoted to yield 6.48 percent.</p>
<p>JAPAN - Key March Japanese Goverment Bonds (JGB) ended easier on delayed response to a 44.2 percent jump in October private machinery orders. In after hours trading the March future on LIFFE was trading at 125.69, down 0.23 from Monday's settlement price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>EUROBONDS - The primary market saw a jumbo mark Eurobond from Argentina hit the screen first in Tuesday's early session. Argentina launched a 1.0 billion mark February 2005 bond to yield 295 basis points over Bunds. UBS set a self-led 250 million stg 10-year bond. In dollars, Sweden's Foreningsbanken set two floating rate bonds, one perpetual and the other a seven-year issue both via Salomon Brothers. Brazil's Globex set a $100 million eight-year bond.</p>
