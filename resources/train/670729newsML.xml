<p>Investors piled into utility EDP-Electricidade de Portugal on Wednesday to fill unsatisfied demand in its privatisation and analysts said the shares could climb even higher if Spanish utilities grab a stake.</p>
<p>Mainly domestic institutional and retail investors snapped up EDP shares, which nudged past 3,175 escudos, up 76, in volume of more than 4.5 million shares on the second day of trade after the successful sell-off of a 30 percent stake on Monday.</p>
<p>Shares of EDP, Portugal's dominant electricity provider and the biggest company quoted on the Lisbon bourse, surged 37.7 percent on their first trading day on Tuesday from a privatisation price of 2,250 escudos per share.</p>
<p>Analysts said the fundamental value of EDP, a technical term reflecting its true worth, was between 2,800 and 3,100 escudos per share and that it was trading at a premium to leading Spanish utility Endesa.</p>
<p>Institutional investors were filling their portfolios with EDP shares they had not obtained in the more than 30 times oversubscribed privatisation as EDP will be included in the PSI20  index of leading Portuguese stocks from July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;No one was satisfied with the number of shares received in the privatisation. There is demand on all sides, including from retail investors who were not strong buyers in past Portuguese privatisations,&quot; said Jose Freire of Espirito Santo Research.</p>
<p>London- and Madrid-based analysts polled by Reuters said EDP was trading at around 20 times 1997 earnings, at a premium to Endesa which was trading at about 17 times 1997 earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is plenty of froth on the stock,&quot; said one analyst, who added that the high price of EDP was not justified considering that the firm was heavily overstaffed and its management was entering the private sector for the first time.</p>
<p>Analysts said the likelihood that Spanish utilities Endesa and Iberdrola would take strategic stakes of up to the legal limit of five percent in EDP would eventually drive the share price higher.</p>
<p>&quot;With the supply of EDP shares tight, if a Spanish utility bought up to five percent, the share price would have to rise,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>Utilities were believed to have received no shares in the privatisation of EDP, according to newspaper reports.</p>
<p>Freire said that EDP was a good long-term investment as it was the most liquid stock on the Portuguese market and was set to boost its profit in the next two years.</p>
<p>A climate of falling interest rates and low inflation has been driving up interest in the Lisbon bourse, among Europe's best performing stock markets over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>Small investors who bought the stock cheaply in the privatisation and later accumulated more shares at a much higher price on the open market still benefited from the low average price of their total holdings, Freire said.</p>
<p>Analysts polled by Reuters said they expected EDP's earnings per share (EPS) to stand at between 140 and 151 escudos per share in 1997 and between 164 and 165 escudos per share in 1998.</p>
<p>They said Endesa's earnings per share would rise from 643 pesetas per share in 1997 to 688 in 1998.</p>
<p>Analysts said cost cutting, which includes plans to reduce the size of the workforce, and the possibility that EDP may become involved in the telecommunications market boosted its earnings prospects.</p>
<p>EDP, which may compete for a third mobile phone licence in Portugal, was contemplating a high risk strategy that could produce high returns, although not in the short term, they said.</p>
