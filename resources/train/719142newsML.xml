<headline>Brazil tests to see if bomb caused plane blast.</headline>

<p>Technicians began tests on Thursday to determine if a bomb caused the explosion that tore a gaping hole in a Brazilian TAM airplane through which a passenger was sucked out in mid-flight, authorities said.</p>
<p>&quot;Materials from the plane are being analysed to discover the origin of the explosion. We think chemicals caused it but we don't know if they were part of a bomb,&quot; a spokesman for the Aeronautics Ministry in Brasilia said.</p>
<p>TAM Vice President Luiz Eduardo Falco said the airline had received no bomb threats. Authorities said it was too early to speculate about any motives for a bombing.</p>
<p>TAM Flight 283 was on a routine trip on Wednesday between Sao Jose dos Campos, an industrial city 68 miles (110 km) west of Sao Paulo, and Sao Paulo when the explosion occurred. A total of 60 passengers and crew were on board.</p>
<p>The blast ripped a six-foot by four-foot (two by 1.3-metre) chunk from the fuselage of the Fokker-100 regional jet, sucking out a 38-year-old man who fell 7,200 feet (2,400 metres) to his death.</p>
<p>A flight attendant recited a prayer on the plane's public announcement system above the screams of horrified passengers, who had to wait 15 minutes before the plane could make an emergency landing at Sao Paulo's busy Congonhas airport.</p>
<p>The body of passenger Fernando Caldeira de Morua Campos was found next to parts of the fuselage in a field outside the town of Suzano, 32 miles (50 km) from Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>Six passengers and crew members suffering from problems relating to the sharp change in cabin pressure had been released from hospitals by noon on Thursday, a TAM spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Police said they found burn marks on the floor and underneath the row of three seats which were hurled from the aircraft. Investigators believe the explosion was caused by an object that was on top of one of the seats, the ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said it was not known when the tests would be completed, and some of the plane's pieces might have to be shipped to laboratories outside Brazil for closer inspection.</p>
<p>The blast was TAM's second accident in less than a year. Eight months ago, another Fokker-100 aircraft belonging to the airline slammed into homes in a densely populated area of Sao Paulo, killing 98 people including two on the ground.</p>
<p>TAM, Brazil's top regional carrier and Latin America's fastest-growing airline, was recently named company of the year by the leading national business magazine Exame.</p>
