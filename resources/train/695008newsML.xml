<p>Egyptian share prices rose on Sunday to reverse a week-long trend that had pushed the overall index to a five-month low.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index climbed 2.26 points to 345.69 in below-average turnover of 33.20 million pounds ($9.8 million).</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting the whole market to go up in the summer. News coming in reflects this rise. It's probably been encouraged by government hints that it could privatise some utilities,&quot; said Mohammed Abdullah, managing director of Intercapital.</p>
<p>National Societe Generale (NSG) was the day's most active share, rising 0.7 pounds to 81 after trading in four million pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;National Societe Generale is looked upon as one of the good banks. It had a capital increase recently and a stock split, which added a lot of liquidity. It will continue to do well,&quot; Abdullah said.</p>
<p>The French-dominated bank has issued five-year floating-rate notes denominated in Egyptian pounds to raise 150 million pounds for medium-term financing.</p>
<p>NSG said in a published announcement on Sunday that the subscription, which opened on June 17, would close on June 30 because it was oversubscribed but it did not say by how much.</p>
<p>The banks's general assembly agreed in March to increase NSG's capital to 120 million pounds from 100 million by issuing one free share for each five.</p>
<p>Commercial International Bank traded in shares worth 3.2 million pounds but closed 0.25 pounds lower at 70.25.</p>
<p>Misr International Bank/MIBANK which issued a global depository receipt (GDR) last week, closed 28.08 pounds higher at 589.83.</p>
<p>Fertiliser firm Egyptian Financial and Industrial (EFI) was the day's second most actively-traded share, climbing 6.99 pounds to 203 after shares worth two million pounds changed hands.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the bourse's golden stocks. It is has stirred the interest of foreign investors because of its expansion plans and growth prospects,&quot; Abdullah said.</p>
<p>The privatised firm was started with a &quot;strong buy&quot; rating by London-based stockbrokers T. Hoare and Co. earlier this month.</p>
<p>Analysts said they based their recommendation on, among other things, the firm's expansion plans which will make it the world's largest producer of Single Super Phosphate fertiliser by 1999. The Egyptian state sold 65 percent of EFI's total 3.25 million shares to private investors last year.</p>
<p>Abdullah said he expected the milling sector to reap the rewards of a public share offer in Alexandria Flour Mills which opened on Sunday for two days.</p>
<p>The state's Holding Company for Rice and Flour Mills has offered to the public at least 400,000 shares, or 10 percent, of Alexandria Flour Mills at an initial offer price at 75 pounds per share.</p>
<p>The state has previously sold part of its stake in several milling firms but it has said it will not reliquish its majority control of the sector because of its &quot;strategic nature&quot;.</p>
<p>The index for openly traded firms rose to 465.94 points from 461.15 points on Thursday and that for the rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 257.69 from 256.47 points.</p>
<p>Of the 88 shares traded, 37 rose, 31 fell while 20 ended unchanged.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.395 pounds</p>
