<p>Denmark's independent Economic Council on Wednesday gave the country a generally clean bill of health, revising upward its forecasts for growth while cutting expectations for inflation, unemployment and the budget deficit.</p>
<p>But the council, known as the Wise Men, said that growing wage pressure could threaten competitiveness and urged further privatisation to bolster the shrinking current account surplus.</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying problems of the Danish economy show a continued great need for action,&quot; they said in their biannual report.</p>
<p>&quot;The favourable development of the Danish economy should therefore be used to implement further structural reform and in the longer term ensure an improvement in public finances,&quot; the survey added.</p>
<p>The report, like the previous outlook last May, saw growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) weaker in 1996 than in 1995, as the result of an international and domestic lull still feeding through inventories.</p>
<p>While still lower than 1995, the revised growth outlook for 1996 was dramatically higher than in the May survey, up to 2.0 percent from the earlier forecast of 0.9.</p>
<p>The projection for 1997 was likewise upgraded, to 2.9 percent from an earlier 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>GDP growth in 1995 was 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>Linked to its increased growth expectations was a scaling back of the outlook for the public sector budget deficit, now seen as falling from 1995's 16.2 billion crowns to 13.4 billion in 1996 and 4.1 billion the following year.</p>
<p>The government is seeking to whittle away the 1997 shortfall in its current budget negotiations with opposition parties but the Wise Men remain sceptical about its prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;Without further tightening of fiscal policy there will still be a small deficit in 1997 and indeed 1998,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The outlook for the current account was mixed; The report saw a healthy 13.8 billion crown surplus in 1996 compared to its previous prognosis of 9.6 billion and 1995's 8.1 billion.</p>
<p>But it said the 1997 surplus was likely to shrink to 6.3 billion crowns, rather than its earlier estimate of 10.9 billion and warned that it could disappear as oil and gas reserves decrease unless the government took preemptive action.</p>
<p>&quot;If one fails to implement in good time structural reforms that improve competitiveness and stimulate saving one risks a situation where swiftly mounting foreign debt necessitates extreme measures such as fiscal tightening,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Wise Men saw unemployment continuing to fall from 1995's 288,400 to 245,000 in 1996 and 236,000 in 1997.</p>
<p>They warned that fuller employment brought the risk of upward wage pressure, although the report reduced earlier inflation forecasts to 2.2 percent this year and 2.6 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Interviewed on state radio after publication of the report, Economy Minister Marianne Jelved said the government would consider further fiscal tightening if next year's pay round produced excessive rises.</p>
<p>&quot;We could find ourselves in a situation, if pay talks do not have a reasonable outcome, where we must implement an extraordinary tightening,&quot; she said.</p>
