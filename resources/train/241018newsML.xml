<p>European Union foreign ministers snubbed Yugoslavia on Friday by refusing to grant it the preferential trade terms it has granted to others in the Balkan region.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not even envisaged it could have been done today,&quot; one EU official said, adding it would have sent the wrong signal in view of recent developments in Serbia, which together with Montenegro make up rump Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The ministers were expected to issue a strongly worded statement, demanding that Belgrade respect the November 17 local election results.</p>
<p>Students and the opposition have been campaigning against President Slobodan Milosevic in the streets of Belgrade since Zajedno, the opposition coalition, accused the ruling Socialists of robbing it of victory in the elections.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion there will be no further deliberations on the question of preferential trade arrangements until the local elections issue has been sorted out,&quot; Carl Bildt, international high representative, told reporters.</p>
<p>At their last meeting on November 25, EU foreign ministers agreed in principle to grant Serbia and Montenegro preferential trade treatment with the 15-country bloc -- but to delay implementation at least until their December 6 meeting.</p>
<p>The annulment of the election results, Belgrade's perceived lack of assistance in pursuing alleged war criminals and continued tension over the Serb-governed Kosovo region are among reasons why the ministers are reluctant to reward Belgrade with better trade terms.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel drew parallels with the situation in eastern Europe before the Berlin Wall came down seven years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody who undermines the will of the people will have a hard time finding the road to Europe,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The central message has to be to encourage those on the streets in their struggle for democracy,&quot; Kinkel added.</p>
<p>However, Bildt noted &quot;signs of light in the darkness yesterday,&quot; referring to a series of concessions by the authorities on Thursday.</p>
<p>For example, banned independent radios have been allowed to start broadcasting again and the supreme court has agreed to review the election results.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that they did not succeed in closing down the most important independent media in Belgrade is significant,&quot; Bildt said.</p>
<p>Bildt said Serbia faced a political and economic crisis crisis which could have implications for the whole region.</p>
<p>He believed the crisis would escalate if the supreme court did not make certain that the November 17 election results were respected. The EU would then have to look at its policy options, he said.</p>
<p>But he seemed to dismiss the idea of sanctions. &quot;I think discussions on sanctions are somewhat out of place to put it mildly,&quot; he said, adding sanctions tended to reinforce regimes and hit primarily the middle classes.</p>
<p>In the absence of sanctions, Milosevic would not be able to blame the outside world for Serbia's continuing difficulties.</p>
<p>&quot;People will blame it increasingly on him...and that I think is going to force the demands for political and economic reforms in Serbia,&quot; Bildt said.</p>
