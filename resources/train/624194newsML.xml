<title>UK: Low commercial stocks boost metals - Rudolf Wolff.</title>
<headline>Low commercial stocks boost metals - Rudolf Wolff.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-29</dateline>

<p>Tight commercial stocks in copper and other base metals, some of them below critical levels, are a key factor driving markets higher, brokers Rudolf Wolff said in a report.</p>
<p>Total commercial stocks for copper equal just 3.8 weeks of consumption, compared to what the brokers consider the &quot;critical level&quot; of five weeks, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;With the exception of nickel, where stocks are above critical levels, the fundamentals suggest that supply deficits will lead significant stock shortages,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Copper was expected to remain tight and &quot;vulnerable to further price spikes over this quarter&quot; on strength in underlying demand excerbated by low stocks, delays in start-ups and industrial disputes.</p>
<p>Later in the year, however, copper prices would ease as the market shifts into a supply surplus, it added.</p>
<p>Aluminium stock levels at 6.6 weeks' worth of  consumption and zinc at 6.7 weeks are also drawing close to the six-week critical level.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong economic growth...coupled with further anticipated deficit on top of this year's drawdown, should take total commerical stocks (of aluminium) down below critical levels,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Zinc stocks are falling at a rate that will bring them down to cirical level before the year-end,&quot; it added. But increased producer and Chinese selling will dampen the rally as prices move higher.</p>
<p>Lead stocks are already below the 5.5-week point at 4.6 weeks, and is expected to stage a partial recovery this year, the report said.</p>
<p>Nickel stocks, however, are well above the seven-week critical point at 12.1 weeks. But demand for stainless steel is expected to rise.</p>
<p>Other bullish factors for some of the metals include strong world economic growth and investor interest in commodities.</p>
