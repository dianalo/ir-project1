<headline>OPTIONS-Volatility in FTSE options drifts lower.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatility in the FTSE options continued to drift lower on Tuesday as the underlying blue chip index scored a fresh record high.</p>
<p>Implied volatility in September FTSE options was holding between 10.0 and 10.5 percent, with November options around 11.5 to 12.0 percent, said one options dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatility is flat. It spiked up ahead of the (U.S. employment) numbers on Friday, and has drifted off since. I don't see how it can go much lower,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Trading volume in FTSE options was relatively light. Almost half of the volume of both puts and calls was in the 3,900 strike price. And most of that volume was on the put side.</p>
<p>&quot;There was good two-way business (at the 3,900 strike), but I think that has more to do with people adjusting their books with the market at these levels,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>By 1354, the FTSE 100 was up 10.8 points to 3,921.6, after rising to a new all-time peak at 3,933.6 earlier.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, traders noted the purchase of 700 October 850 calls in Imperial Chemical Industries at 27p. Traders reckoned the buyer probably sold stock against the calls.  </p>
<p>Shares in ICI were up 17p to 857p.</p>
<p>Other big trades included the sale of 1,000 December 90 puts in UK retailer Sears at 3p, and the purchase of 1,000 November 220 puts in Vodafone at 5p.</p>
<p>Dealers also noted the purchase of 500 January 650 calls in British Petroleum at 23p. They said the underlying stock was sold at 637p against the calls.</p>
<p>The shares were up 4-1/2p at 638p.</p>
<p>They also said 300 January 330 calls were sold in Safeway at 22p. Shares in Safeway were up 4-1/2p to 339-1/2p.</p>
