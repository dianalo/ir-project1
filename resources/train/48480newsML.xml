<p>U.S. Midcontinent unleaded gasoline differentials eased in the Group Three market against rising front-month unleaded futures prices, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chicago unleaded differentials were steady after firming earlier in the day, but traders said there were no outages behind the modest upward move on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Chicago is firming, but there are no outages and nothing is down as far as I know,&quot; said one trader, attributing the gains to nervousness over increased military posturing in Iraq.  </p>
<p>Group Three unleaded was bid 0.25 cent over the print for prompt deliveries and 1.0 cent under the print for later deliveries, with premium talked 2.50 cents higher.</p>
<p>Chicago unleaded remained 1.0/1.25 cent over the print for prompt deliveries and firmed to even to 0.25 cent over the print for later deliveries.</p>
<p>Group Three low sulphur diesel was talked 3.0/3.25 cents over the print for prompt deliveries and 2.50/2.75 cents over for later deliveries.</p>
<p>Chicago low sulphur diesel remained 1.25/1.50 cents over the print for prompt and later deliveries.</p>
<p>High sulphur was talked 1.0 cents over the print for prompt deliveries and a half-cent weaker for later deliveries in Group Three, and even to 0.25 cent under the print in Chicago.</p>
