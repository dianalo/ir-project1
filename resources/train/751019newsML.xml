<p>Hundreds of relatives of Jewish Holocaust victims living in Australia could be eligible for funds in Swiss banks after the publication of more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, Jewish officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>While only four Australian names were on the list, Australia boasts the world's fourth largest Jewish population, due to large scale post-World War Two migration.</p>
<p>&quot;There are more Jews of Polish decent living in Australia than there are Jews living in Poland,&quot; said Jeremy Jones, spokesman for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.</p>
<p>&quot;There could potentially be hundreds (of relatives) on this list, but we do not believe that this list is comprehensive or exhaustive. This is the list from the Swiss banks: it is not a list discovered by any independent audit,&quot; Jones told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Swiss Bankers Association took out a double-page advertisement in The Australian national newspaper, listing more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, including assets by Holocaust victims. The list included four Australian men.</p>
<p>&quot;We imagine of the thousands of names many of those will not have any living relatives because of the extent of the Nazi genocide,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>However, Jones said the publication of the list will make it easier for relatives of Holocaust victims to claim funds.</p>
<p>Swiss bank sources on Tuesday said the total amount in dormant accounts was around US$40 million rather than US$29 million as the banks said last year.</p>
<p>&quot;They are now saying we have this list and the issue is proving a relationship, which is easier,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly hope this is an indication that the Swiss banks will no longer demand every receipt and deposit slip and every account number,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jones said Australian Jews had mixed feelings about the publication of the list.</p>
<p>&quot;We are happy, but why has it taken 52 years to happen. There has been a large level abrogation of morality,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a Sydney Jewish family said it had made a successful claim for funds belonging to a Holocaust victim held in a Swiss bank.</p>
<p>The deal was done three weeks ago in Zurich between Sydney accountant Stephen Baruch and the Union Bank of Switzerland, Baruch told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Australian newspaper reported Jewish community sources saying the amount, based on an original deposit of 600 pounds sterling in 1938, was now worth more than US$154,000. Baruch said that was an exaggeration.</p>
