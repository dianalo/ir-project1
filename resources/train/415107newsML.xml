<p>European Union environment ministers opened the bidding on Monday in the search for a year-end global deal to cut industrialised countries' emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In agreeing to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent of 1990 levels by 2010, albeit without a full deal on which country cuts what, the 15-member bloc laid down a marker for climate change talks scheduled for Kyoto in Japan in December.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gases trap heat close to the earth's surface and are blamed for what scientists fear will be a long-term warming of the global climate.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the first time that we have been able to get every member of the (EU) to commit itself to clear figures,&quot; British Environment Minister John Gummer told reporters after hours of closed-door talks.</p>
<p>But they agreed the details of how to share out individual cuts between countries for only 10 percentage points of the 15 percent pledged, an indication of the difficulties the EU still faces with its announced target.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a minus 15 percent figure agreed in Kyoto then the EU is committed to developing measures in addition to the existing national commitments,&quot; Dutch environment ministry official Cees Zoeteman told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;If Kyoto reaches agreement on minus 10 percent, which would be a major step forward and far from likely at this moment, then we are ready to implement it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the EU would have to think again about its 15 percent pledge if the Japan meeting failed to back that for all industrialised countries.</p>
<p>A briefing note sent to British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine from British diplomats in Brussels threw Monday's deal into even starker relief.</p>
<p>&quot;...since we recognise that the Americans will not sign up to 10 percent, let alone 15 percent, this is all purely hypothetical,&quot; said a text of the note seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>Gummer nevertheless challenged richer nations, in and outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development, to match the EU's position.</p>
<p>&quot;We want all those countries to commit to a 15 percent reduction by 2010,&quot; he said, singling out the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. has not yet committed itself to any timetable for any reduction at all or even any stabilisation. It is now crucial that the U.S. takes part,&quot; Gummer said.</p>
<p>United Nations figures for 1990 carbon emissions put the EU total at 866 million tonnes, the U.S.'s at 1.35 billion, Japan's at 315 million and Russia's at 651 million.</p>
<p>The Dutch, as holders of the EU presidency, unusually started the meeting on a Sunday ahead of the ministers' regular talks on Monday and international negotiations by climate officials starting, also on Monday in Bonn.</p>
<p>They rejigged an earlier proposal, softening the demands on most countries and abandoning a specific target for CO2 cuts within the overall 15 percent cut.</p>
<p>Germany and Britain, two of the EU's major fossil-fuel users, saw their allotted targets cut from 30 percent to 25 per cent and from 20 percent to 10 percent respectively.</p>
<p>France's target was cut to zero from the originally suggested five percent reduction while Italy's went from the 10 percent cut proposed to seven percent.</p>
<p>Others seeing softer targets included Ireland, allowed a 15 percent increase instead of the suggested five percent rise, Finland, granted a freeze in place of a 10 percent cut, and Greece, with a 30 percent rise in place of five percent.</p>
<p>Portugal's target rose 15 percentage points to 40 percent, Spain's rose two percentage points to 17 percent while Luxembourg's 40 percent cut became 30 percent.</p>
<p>Belgium and the Dutch retained their 10 percent cuts while Austria and Denmark kept their 25 percent cuts and Sweden its five percent rise.</p>
