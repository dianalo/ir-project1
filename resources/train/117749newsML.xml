<p>The European Commission will study a plan to split German machinery firm SKET GmbH, but it will not close its eyes on subsidies paid to the embattled company, a Commission official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The former East Germany's biggest heavy machinery group said earlier on Tuesday that it would apply for liquidation proceedings after workers refused to accept a drastic restructuring plan which would have shed more than two thirds of the workforce.</p>
<p>The move is meant to protect the company from its creditors while continuing negotiations on a salvage plan.</p>
<p>The Commission official said Saxony-Anhalt's Economy and European Affairs Minister Klaus Schucht informed European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert on Monday of the measures planned.</p>
<p>&quot;They (German authorities) are talking about splitting the company, but they should not assume that the old debts will be wiped out,&quot; the official told reporters.</p>
<p>The Commission said last year that it had serious doubts about approving 957.1 million marks ($622.5 million) in paid or planned aid to SKET in the form of credit waiving, loan guarantees and other financial assistance. This was because the restructuring plan submitted at the time did not guarantee the company's viability.</p>
<p>Schucht told reporters in Brussels on Monday night that the Commission had pledged to look into the new plan &quot;with an open mind&quot;. He said the Commission would send an expert to the company in Magdeburg to assess its viability. The expert was expected to report in four to six weeks, Schucht said.</p>
<p>&quot;The plan previously submitted was unacceptable&quot;, the Commission official said, but added that some of SKET's subsidiaries might be more sound than their parent company.</p>
<p>It appears unlikely that the discussions over SKET subsidies will develop into a major dispute between the EU and the state of Saxony-Anhalt similar to the recent row over aid to Volkswagen AG in neighbouring Saxony.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the Commission decides, we will accept it,&quot; Schucht said.</p>
<p>But the Commission could still be blamed for SKET's plight as it was when Germany's largest shipyard, Bremer Vulkan, went under as the Commission insisted the company repay aid it had misappropriated.</p>
<p>&quot;We could be carrying the can again,&quot; the Commission official said.</p>
<p>The board of the embattled firm had proposed splitting SKET into five separate operating units and reducing staff to 570 from 1,850. ($ = 1.537 German Marks)</p>
