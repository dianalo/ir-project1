<p>Minicar maker Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd estimates its 1996 net profit at no less than its goal of 220 million yuan despite fierce competition in the domestic market, a company spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Changan reduced its car prices in 1996 due to intensified competition from other domestic makers but the impact was partially offset by expanding sales, the spokesman told the China Securities Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based newsletter.</p>
<p>He said Changan produced 70,273 minicars in 1996 with sales rising to 70,440, some of which came from 1995's output. The company produced 70,618 minicars in 1995 with sales at 66,178.</p>
<p>In a B share offer prospectus issued in 1996, Changan said that under international accounting standards, it expected net earnings of a minimum of 220 million yuan for 1996, up from 220.16 million yuan in 1995 and 192.52 million yuan in 1994.</p>
<p>It said it had after-tax profits of 82.63 million yuan in the January-June period of 1996.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Changan was waiting for approval from the Beijing authorities to kick off a multi-billion-yuan project scheduled for completion by the end of 1999 which will raise its annual minicar production capacity to 150,000 units.  </p>
<p>The firm expects that it will gain approval for the project in the first half of 1997 and that China's State Development Bank will lend Changan 900 million yuan and a Japanese bank US$200 million to finance it.</p>
<p>Most of the 585 million yuan in proceeds raised from Changan's 250 million B share offer launched in November 1996 will also be injected into the project, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Suzuki Motor Corporation, American Suzuki Motor Corporation and Nissho Iwai Corporation bought 50 percent of Changan's B shares at a price equivalent to 2.96 yuan per share and pleged to hold their shares for at least three years.</p>
<p>The other 125 million B shares were offered to overseas investors at HK$1.89 each.</p>
