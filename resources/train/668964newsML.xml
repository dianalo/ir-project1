<title>USA: Advanta up on takeover rumors - analysts.</title>
<headline>Advanta up on takeover rumors - analysts.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Advanta Corp gained about eight percent Wednesday amid renewed rumors that the monoline credit card company is a takeover candidate, analysts said.</p>
<p>Industry analysts, however, had vastly different notions of how much a buyer would be willing to pay for the company.</p>
<p>Advanta was up 2-7/16 to 34-5/16. About 1.8 million shares had changed hands by 1510 EDT/1910 GMT, more than three times Advanta's average daily trading volume.  </p>
<p>Advanta declined to comment on the activity in its stock.</p>
<p>&quot;My official view is that I'd be surprised if it (Advanta) went for over $30 a share,&quot; said Gary Gordon, an analyst at PaineWebber.</p>
<p>&quot;If the market has a view that it's a takeover target, it can talk (the stock price) up. But that doesn't mean it will necessarily go for that price. I doubt any rational buyer would pay more than $30.&quot;</p>
<p>Others put a higher price tag on Advanta shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the company demonstrates to investors or a potential acquirer that its problems are behind it, it could get as much as $60 a share,&quot; said Leslie Nelkin, an analyst with Furman Selz. &quot;If not, it could fetch about $40 a share.&quot;</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Advanta posted a loss of $0.43 a share, compared with a profit of $0.91 in the 1996 first quarter.</p>
<p>Advanta's first quarter was hurt by increases in consumer bankruptcies and charge-offs, and lower receivable balances than originally expected in its credit card business.  </p>
<p>Analysts said they knew of no specific suitor, but Nelkin said it would make sense for Advanta to combine with another financial institution.</p>
<p>&quot;But it's hard to say if it's this month or six months from now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In March, Advanta said it had hired BT Wolfensohn to review its business strategy, growth prospects and operating environment.</p>
<p>The Australian Financial Review newspaper recently reported that National Australia Bank Ltd was looking at a possible takeover of Advanta. NAD, Australia's largest bank, declined comment on the report.</p>
<p>Prudential Securities analyst Jennifer Scutti downgraded Advanta today to hold from buy. No details were available.</p>
