<p>COFFEE: World market for October 25, 1996</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London finished mixed but near the day's highs on late short-covering and trade buying. But front-month November bucked the bearish trend, closing $15 higher at $1,525 while January shed $1.00 to close at $1,383.</p>
<p>In New York arabica futures ended mixed with spot December 1.45 cents/lb lower, while March closed 45 points higher at 104.10 cents/lb. That narrowed the December/March switch to 11.90 cents/lb.</p>
<p>The end of the truckers strike in Colombia as well as ongoing media reports that an error was made in the amount of coffee reduced from US certified coffee stocks this past week, weighed on prices.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the actual figure of just over 5,000 bags is correct and therefore minimal coffee exists. According to Celsius Lodder, executive director of the International Coffee Organization, that is not likely to change significantly in 1996/97 as only a slight excess is expected. Lodder said that world prices should range between 110 and 130 cents/lb.</p>
<p>Lodder, who spoke to Reuters shortly before a news conference at the National Coffee Growers Federation in Bogota, predicted coffee production of between 99 and 100 million 60-kg bags for the 1996/97 coffee year (October/September).</p>
<p>But he said this would be countered by demand for up to 98 million bags, including about 25 million bags that would be consumed in producer countries themselves. He added that supply would be tight enough to lead to possible volatility on world markets but predicted that prices would range no higher than about 130 cents/lb.</p>
<p>Demand by consumer countries will total somewhere between 72 and 73 million 60-kg bags in 1996/97, Lodder said.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>E.D.&amp; F. MAN - The latest E.D.&amp; F. Man report showed a 300,000 bag reduction in consumer inventories in September to 8.7 million bags, 1.8 million bags below year-ago levels. European stocks fell by 100,000 bags to 5.9 million bags so the situation is not as tight as in the United States where stocks are only 1.161 million bags.</p>
<p>COLOMBIA - According to Jorge Cardenas, head of the National Coffee Growers Federation, coffee production in 1995/96 (October/September) reached about 12.9 million 60-kg bags, above earlier expectations and roughly in line with what was produced in 1994/95.</p>
<p>However, Cardenas stressed that this figure was only a 'very preliminary' estimate and that it could be weeks before the Federation releases any official production numbers for the 1995/96 coffee year. He said delays could still be expected in Colombia's October coffee shipments due to the truckers strike and that about 150,000 bags promised for delivery in October were unlikely to reach roasters until November.</p>
<p>Private exporters said enormous backlogs have built up in Colombia's ports since the strike began at midnight, October 13, and it will take days or even weeks before shipments return to normal.</p>
<p>BRAZIL - According to Mauricio Assiss, Industry and Commerce Ministry Commodity Secretary, Brazil's 1996/97 (May/April) coffee production will total between 25 and 26 million 60-kg bags. He forecast that Minas Gerais state will produce 12.4 million, Espirito Santo 4.0 million, Sao Paulo 3.3 million, Parana 1.2 million and smaller states will make up the remainder.</p>
<p>Assiss predicted that 15 million bags will be exported, 10 million bags will be for internal consumption and 2.5 million bags will be processed as soluble - 80 per cent of which is exported. Therefore, there will be a small deficit that will be met by draw downs of private government stocks, he said.</p>
