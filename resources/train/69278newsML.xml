<p>Hong Kong protesters set sail on a rusty tanker on Sunday for disputed islands in the East China Sea to play cat-and-mouse with Japanese warships and to try to assert Chinese sovereignty over the isles.</p>
<p>Japan has claimed sovereign rights to the islands -- known in Japanese as the Senkakus and the Diaoyus in Chinese -- and refused to acknowledge that the dispute is still open for discussion with China.</p>
<p>Tokyo's claim dates to 1895, when Japan defeated China and seized Taiwan and other territories. China has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries.</p>
<p>The 2,800-tonne cargo tanker, Kien Hwa 2, carrying 18 anti-Japanese activists, 19 crew and 42 journalists, weaved its way through a colourful flotilla of yachts and other seacraft bobbing on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes as it began its three-day journey to the rocky outcrop.</p>
<p>A big banner emblazoned across the bow of the ship boldly stated the mission's intention. &quot;We, the Chinese people, request that you, the Japanese, leave Chinese waters,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will use every tactic and every strategy, such as hide-and-seek, to dodge the Japanese patrol boats and get onto those islands to raise the Chinese flag and restore our sovereignty,&quot; David Chan, convenor of the Alliance of the Worldwide Chinese for the Protection of the Diaoyu Islands, told Reuters shortly before the vessel departed.</p>
<p>In a parting gesture, Chan held aloft the big Chinese national flag he intends to firmly embed on the islands, and led his supporters in singing the Chinese national anthem.</p>
<p>His mission would not obey any orders to turn back if confronted by Japanese warships, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are civilians, we have no weapons, no explosives, and our ship is only a cargo ship, it's not armed. We will not retreat,&quot; Chan told Reuters.</p>
<p>The protesters would use two rubber dinghies to try to beguile Japanese coast guard vessels.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be five Japanese warships patrolling those waters around the islands, but it will not be so easy to catch us.</p>
<p>&quot;We know this could be dangerous, but this is Chinese territory, and we have every right to land there,&quot; Chan said. &quot;So what can the Japanese do to stop us?&quot;</p>
<p>Japanese coast guard vessels have already turned back at least three vessels attempting similiar missions.</p>
<p>Tokyo's claim to the islands has whipped up anti-Japanese fervour in the tiny British colony, culminating in almost daily protest action.</p>
<p>Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, next year.</p>
