<p>Rapid growth in an increasingly dynamic stock market drove German equity funds' returns higher in the first half of 1997, German investment group BVI said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>German investors have rushed to equity investments in recent months, extending a flurry of interest chiefly kicked off by Deutsche Telekom AG's flotation in November .</p>
<p>Returns from equity-based funds composed of German equities have seen an increase of up to 41.5 percent in the first six months of 1997.</p>
<p>Over one year , the average rise in the value of German equity-backed funds was 44 percent, with the highest rate of increase at 62 percent.</p>
<p>On a five-year basis, average returns jumped 102 percent, while ten-year products surged 173 percent and 785 percent on a 20-year basis.</p>
<p>This compares with the DAX index's overall 45-percent growth rate since the start of 1997.</p>
<p>The BVI used record levels on the DAX of 3,785 points at the end of June to calculate its figures but even this threshold has been broken in the past two weeks. The DAX ended bourse trade at 4,201 points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>International funds also registered double-digit growth but were slightly more sluggish than their German counterparts.</p>
<p>The average growth rate for international funds in the first half was 27.7 percent and 35.8 percent on a one-year basis.</p>
<p>The value of investment funds based on the U.S. stock market rose 26.6 percent in the first six months, but a 48-percent increase on a one-year basis and 147 percent over five years meant U.S. funds led the field among different funds and served German investors best, the BVI said.</p>
<p>German bond-backed funds also increased over the first six months by an average four percent, or 10.2 percent on a one-year basis.</p>
<p>International bond-backed funds grew 7.2 percent in the first six months and were 15.1 percent ahead of last year.</p>
<p>Mixed funds, composed of fixed income products and equities, grew 16.7 percent in the first six months and 22.8 percent over last year.</p>
