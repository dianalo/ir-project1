<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-03-18</dateline>

<p>Russian shares closed mixed on Tuesday, and traders said the market felt weak and expected prices to drift lower in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;The last week and a half has had good economic and political news and the market has done nothing,&quot; said a senior Western trader.</p>
<p>&quot;When a previously strong market reacts poorly to good economic news that usually presages a sell-off, and that is what is happening. You name it, you can buy it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 23-shares lost 0.11 percent to close at 330.01. A year ago it hit its record low, 66.69.</p>
<p>UES  EESR.RTS, a recent favourite among foreign investors, eased to $0.2220 from $0.2260 at Monday's close. Chelyabenergo CHNG.RTS fell to $0.450 from $0.480.</p>
<p>Automaker Gaz  GAZA.RTS shot up to $40.00 from $33.10 after Boris Nemtsov, governor of Nizhny Novgorod region where Gaz is located and newly-appointed First Deputy Prime Minister, said bureaucrats would have to drive domestic vehicles.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin is in the process of forming a new government.</p>
<p>Some traders blamed shareholder meetings for a pause in the market, but said they were generally puzzled by its failure to move.</p>
<p>Peter Kizenko, chief trader at ING Barings, said the fact that economic indicators showing a growing economy had been questioned by some economists was troubling. He said the market would likely be quiet for a few more weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;People want to see how the new cabinet takes its first steps,&quot; he said. &quot;If it does not stumble, we should be geared for a fourth consecutive summer rally.&quot;</p>
<p>Trinfiko trader Ilya Galtsov said operators were not expecting anything special from the upcoming summit between Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, scheduled for Thursday in Helsinki.</p>
