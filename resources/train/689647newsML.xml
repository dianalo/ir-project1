<p>North Dakota's unadjusted unemployment rate dropped to 2.7 percent in May from 2.9 percent in April, according to statistics that do not reflect considerable job displacements caused by severe flooding at that time, the state job service department reported Thursday.</p>
<p>The major portion of the unemployment caused by the Red River Valley flooding occurred during a period when the state was not collecting unemployment data in April and May, department Research Director Tom Pederson said in a statement.</p>
<p>While the unadjusted rate dropped when compared to April, it was up from the 2.5 percent rate of May 1996, the department reported.</p>
<p>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose from 2.9 percent in April to 3.2 percent in May as well, the department reported. The adjusted rate had been 3 percent in May 1996.</p>
<p>Nonagricultural wage and salary employment increased 7,250 jobs in May led by construction with a 28.7 percent increase and mining with an 8.8 percent increase, the department reported.</p>
<p>Wholesale trade, manufacturing, government and services sectors also showed lesser increases in May, the department reported.</p>
<p>The finance, insurance and real estate sector remained unchanged and decreases were reported in transportation, communications and utilities sectors, the department reported.</p>
