<p>Thai stocks closed lower in thin trade as a lack of buying interest combined with declines on Wall Street and several regional markets brought the index down, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment was poor today due to falls on Wall Street on Thursday and several markets in this region earlier today. Turnover was thin because of the lack of buying from overseas as several regional markets were closed for the Easter holiday,&quot; said Surachai Pramualcharoenkit of Multi Credit Corp.</p>
<p>The composite SET index fell 3.52 points to 709.09 on 1.3 billion baht turnover.  </p>
<p>The SET-50 index shed 0.50 point to 52.59.</p>
<p>Decliners edged gainers 147 to 144 while 96 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors remained worried over indicators released on Thursday that showed a growing trade deficit in January and a balance of payments deficit for February.</p>
<p>The electronic components sector dropped most, falling 1.35 percent.</p>
<p>First Bangkok City Bank topped the active list, falling 0.50 baht to 22.25. -- Suthep Chawla (662) 652-0642</p>
