<title>VIETNAM: Two netted in growing Vietnam police drugs scandal.</title>

<p>Two more policemen have been arrested in connection with a widening drugs scandal involving members of the country's powerful security apparatus, local authorities in northwest Vietnam said on Friday.</p>
<p>An official in the mountainous Lai Chau province, which borders China and Laos, told Reuters the two men had used official cars last year to ferry five- and six-kg (11- and 13-pound) packages of heroin between the area and Hanoi.</p>
<p>They were caught in a joint operation in late March involving local security officers and police investigators from Hanoi, he said.</p>
<p>The arrests mark a further expansion of a scandal that surfaced last year when a convicted Laotian drugs trafficker broke down in front of a firing squad and begged for his life to be spared in return for information.</p>
<p>Since then some 30 people have been arrested, including senior police officials at Hanoi's Interior Ministry, border guards and others.</p>
<p>The case is expected to come to trial soon.</p>
<p>Vietnam's security apparatus may be the most powerful agency in the communist country, with many of its officers having received training in former Soviet-bloc countries prior to the collapse of East Europe's communist governments.</p>
<p>The government says it is concerned that Vietnam is being targeted by international drugs rings as a conduit and market for illegal narcotics from Laos and China.</p>
<p>Two Hong Kong men and a Canadian woman have been sentenced to death in recent weeks for trafficking heroin.</p>
