<p>Three former teachers in Rwanda have been sentenced to death for their part in the genocide in 1994, Rwandan radio reported.</p>
<p>They appeared before a special court in the southern town of Butare on Friday, accused of mass murder, crimes against humanity, and forming a group which committed atrocities and broke into homes to look for people to massacre.</p>
<p>Faustin Niyonzima, Augustin Ngendahayo, and Ignace Nsengiyunva, refused to speak during their hearings, arguing that the accusations were not contained in their summons, the radio, monitored in Nairobi, reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>They demanded more time to study the cases against them and to find lawyers. But the court rejected these requests, and said the three had been given 15 days to study the cases against them instead of only eight as required by law.</p>
<p>The former teachers, who all served at Butare school, have 15 days to appeal, the radio said.</p>
<p>Rwandan courts have now imposed six death sentences on charges of participation in the 1994 genocide in which 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and allied Hutus were slaughtered following the death in a plane crash of the country's Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana.</p>
<p>Under Rwanda's law, the accused have 15 days to appeal and the appeals court must deliver judgment within three months. Rwanda's genocide trials began on December 27 and some 37 are scheduled to be tried.</p>
