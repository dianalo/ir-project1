<headline>INSIGHT -T-bonds to plod between 106-24 and 107-24.</headline>
<text>
<p>LONDON, April 29 - June T-bond futures will trade within a one-point range on Tuesday, as technical factors take a back seat to this week's stream of U.S. economic data, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is not ready to make a directional statement until it sees the data this week,&quot; said Tom Hobson, director of technical research at Merrill Lynch International in London.</p>
<p>The contract will be confined by 107-24 on the upside, the April 18 low and just above Thursday's close, and 106-24 on the downside, close to the April 4 low, analysts said.</p>
<p>T-bonds were at 107-09 in automated trade at 1004 GMT.</p>
<p>The market was trading 4/32 below Monday's Chicago close.</p>
<p>The data flow begins with the release of the first quarter employment cost index and March durable goods at 1230 GMT on Tuesday, and April consumer confidence at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>Mike Macdonald, technical analyst at 4CAST in London, said T-bonds had been trending down since February and there was still some minor downside potential.</p>
<p>&quot;We could possibly have a re-test of yesterday's low at 106-30 and then a break towards 106-12/17, the mid-April lows,&quot; he said adding that a base was developing above 106-12.</p>
<p>That level was the low on April 11.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't go beneath there yet, momentum is in a bull channel so there is still some upside bias to the contract,&quot; said Macdonald.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week the market could not take out resistance, which left it with a negative bias, and yesterday the bears tried to push it through support,&quot; said Hobson.</p>
<p>Bigger picture resistance for the contract was at 108-15, Hobson said, while key support lay at 106-00.</p>
<p>Macdonald said first resistance was at 107-27, the April 24 high, and above there at recent highs from 108-05 to 108-11.</p>
<p>&quot;It should find some pressure around there as downside was strong last week. But anything above 108-11 takes us up to 108-23,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Before 108-23, Macdonald said there was also resistance at 108-16. That level is a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from 109-25 on March 25 to 106-12.</p>
<p>&quot;There will probably be some reactions there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>September Eurodollar futures were quoted at 93.680 in automated trade at 1015 GMT, against a Chicago close of 93.695.</p>
