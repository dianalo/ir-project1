<title>USA: Fidelity fixed-income manager Gray resigns.</title>

<p>Fidelity Investments said fixed income fund manager Michael Gray, who managed or co-managed nine different mutual funds, has decided to leave the company to start his own investment management firm.</p>
<p>&quot;He's going to take some time off and then he's going to start his own investment management firm specializing in fixed income,&quot; Fidelity spokeswoman Teri Kilduff told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael has done a fine job for shareholders. We are sorry to see him leave but we respect his decision,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>David O'Leary, president of Alpha Equity Research, said he estimates that Gray was responsible for around $10 billion in assets at the nine funds.</p>
<p>Gray's exit, which follows last week's announcement that fund managers Larry Greenberg and Andrew Offit were also quitting, was not over a salary dispute, O'Leary said.</p>
<p>Many of the fund managers have fled to smaller, boutique firms where they have greater control in managing assets, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's got nothing to do with compensation,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;They are going to small firms where they have more flexibility in managing money and you don't have the pressure of living in a fish bowl.&quot;</p>
<p>Don Dion, publisher of the newsletter Fidelity Independent Advisor, said he believed compensation was the main issue for the exodus.</p>
<p>&quot;We're pretty concerned and we think (Fidelity Chairman) Ned Johnson is going to have to open up his wallet and pay these people more,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>As well, the mutual fund industry has exploded over the past year and, with the stock market continuing to set record highs, firms are scouting for experienced managers, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you're a head-hunting firm and you're trying to get someone, you got 400 people to call at Fidelity,&quot; Dion said.</p>
<p>The loss of Greenberg, who managed four funds totalling about $21 billion in assets, was a tough blow for the mutual fund company, analysts said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, to fill the positions for Greenberg and Offit, Fidelity announced a shakeup, changing the managers of nearly 20 mutual funds.</p>
<p>((Michael Ellis, Boston bureau, (617) 367-4176))  </p>
<p>Kilduff said Fidelity would name replacements for Gray at a later date.</p>
<p>Gray managed the fixed-income portions of the $11.2 billion Asset Manager fund, the $3.4 billion Asset Manager: Growth fund, and the $589 million Asset Manager: Income fund.</p>
<p>A 14-year veteran with the company, he also managed the fixed-income assets of the $4.1 billion Balanced fund and he co-managed three of Fidelity's VIP funds.</p>
<p>Gray could not be reached for comment.</p>
