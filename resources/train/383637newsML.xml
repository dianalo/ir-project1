<p>Hanover Foods Corp said on Tuesday it has revised its employment agreement with chairman and chief executive John Warehime to make his pay more incentive-based after lawsuits were filed against the company.</p>
<p>Warehime's base pay for the contract year starting April 1, 1995 was lowered retroactively to $498,000 from $650,000 a year, an attorney for the company said.  </p>
<p>Warehime's bonus will be based on the company's performance compared with other food companies, the attorney said. Warehime holds about 10 percent of Hanover's stock and is voting trustee for the majority of voting shares, the attorney said.</p>
<p>Michael Warehime, his brother and a fellow shareholder, filed a suit over the chairman and chief executive's compensation. A group of shareholders filed an additional lawsuit.</p>
<p>Hanover's independent directors committee is negotiating with Michael Warehime to resolve the litigation and had invited him to join the board once the disputes have been resolved, the company said.</p>
<p>The revised employment agreement was developed by Towers Perrin, a consulting firm that provides advice about executive pay.</p>
