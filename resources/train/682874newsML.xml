<p>*The Australian 10-year bond futures contract held a familiar trading range during after-hours trading with an eye still on last week's peak after holding support at 92.930.</p>
<p>*Policy easing hopes and a more stable U.S. Treasury market helps to underpin market, but again no local data to trade off.  </p>
<p>The September Australian 10-year bond futures contract held a familiar trading range during after-hours trading with an eye still on last week's peak after holding support at 92.930.</p>
<p>The contract ended SYCOM at 92.945 compared with Tuesday's 92.940 pit close after testing the 92.930 level again, but it failed to make progress above a session high of 92.960.</p>
<p>Analysts believe the recent consolidative period will eventually lead to an attack on last week's 3-1/4 year peak of 93.090 set by the expired June contract and once initial firm resistance at 93.015 is taken out.  </p>
<p>Monetary policy easing hopes after next week's Reserve Bank board meeting and a more stable U.S. Treasury market helped to underpin the local market, but turnover is likely to suffer again with no key domestic data to trade off.</p>
<p>However, today's release of the quarterly Japanese Tankan survey at 2350 GMT may provide some direction.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries showed modest price gains after a reasonably well received two-year note auction on Tuesday, overcoming a weaker tone that followed a rise to a 28-year high in the June Conference Board consumer confidence index. The index rose to 129.6 from a revised 127.9 in May.</p>
