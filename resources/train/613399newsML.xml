<p>Low-ranking soldiers who have seized power in Sierra Leone appear increasingly isolated at home and abroad amid talk in the capital of a possible counter-coup.</p>
<p>Residents of the capital Freetown on Monday ignored orders to get back to work. Shops and businesses, largely looted in Sunday's coup, remained closed along with market places.</p>
<p>Parents kept their children away from school, but high school students taking final year examinations ventured to exam centres with the assistance of soldiers.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Liberia, the ECOMOG West African peacekeeping force sealed the land border with Sierra Leone and its naval units mounted coastal patrols. The deployments fuelled speculation that the Nigerian-led force was about to intervene in Sierra Leone where its troops were drawn into coup battles.</p>
<p>ECOMOG deputy force commander Brigadier-General Joe Kwateng told reporters in Monrovia that peacekeeping soldiers deployed in Liberia's western Grand Cape Mount country had been ordered to seal the Sierra Leone border.</p>
<p>&quot;As part of the operation, soldiers of ECOMOG's navy battalion are continuing their patrol of international waters and have also stepped up border patrols,&quot; Kwateng said.</p>
<p>Port officials and military sources in Monrovia said two naval boats left with hundreds of battle-ready peacekeeping troops on Sunday night, presumably heading for Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Heavily armed Nigerian troops accompanied by tactical vehicles boarded the navy vessels, they said.</p>
<p>Reporters saw more combat troops leaving in trucks. Military sources said they were heading for Bo Waterside, 90 miles (150 km) west of Monrovia and halfway to Kenema in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>South Africa joined the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in condemning Sunday's coup, which put an end to just over a year of civilian rule.</p>
<p>Elected president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah escaped to Guinea.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an unpopular coup because we don't want military rule in Sierra Leone anymore and we as lawyers consider it unacceptable,&quot; a prominent Freetown lawyer said.</p>
<p>Freetown residents said the new Armed Forces Revolutionary Council led by Major Johnny Paul Koromah appeared to lack the full backing of the army and the success of the coup had depended on support from prisoners freed from jail early on Sunday.</p>
<p>Troops searched houses looking for ministers of the former civilian government, and military sources said five former ministers were detained at the military headquarters.</p>
<p>The coup leaders said they wanted to bring rebels of the Revolutionary United Front into the government to consolidate an elusive peace in the country's civil war.</p>
<p>The coup drew condemnation from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and OAU leader Salim Ahmed Salim, as well as South Africa, France and Germany.</p>
<p>Salim urged African states to condemn Sierra Leone's new leaders and not to welcome them into OAU ranks. The organisation holds a summit in Zimbabwe next week.</p>
<p>Staff at Freetown's main hospital said at least 18 people were killed in Sunday's fighting. Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez said the dead included two Lebanese.</p>
<p>The hospital sources said two Nigerian peacekeeping soldiers had been killed in the fighting, but ECOMOG Field Commander General Victor Malu said in Lagos there had been no Nigerian casualties.</p>
