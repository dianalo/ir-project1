<headline>Eurobourses weaker after Monday's records.</headline>

<p>The main European stock exchanges were lower in morning trading on Tuesday following a bullish Monday which saw no fewer than eight bourses hit record highs.</p>
<p>Sentiment was blunted when Wall Street's recent rally faltered overnight, with the Dow Industrial Average ending down 13 points.</p>
<p>London, Europe's biggest exchange, took a sharp early dive after the government said shareholders would no longer be able to claim tax credits on share buybacks or special dividend payouts.</p>
<p>The surprise statement initially wiped almost 30 points off the blue chip FTSE 100 index, but it had recovered by mid-morning to trade around a quarter percentage point down.</p>
<p>&quot;We're pretty much back to where we started the day before we took the tax hit...the market's resilience has been very encouraging and we should hold steady here,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the initial reaction had been overdone and was exaggerated by players trying to trigger a break downwards in a market some believed had gone too far, too fast in recent weeks.</p>
<p>They said that although the timing of the British Treasury's announcement had been a surprise, its content was not. They noted that companies would still continue to generate cash and find alternative ways to funnel funds to shareholders.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, floor trading opened a few points down at the beginning of what dealers said looked like being a day of consolidation after the market's recent rise to record levels.</p>
<p>Sportswear maker adidas rose sharply after it announced it would be an official sponsor for the 1998 soccer world cup.</p>
<p>And on the Paris bourse, shares also opened down and slipped further. Traders said the market was consolidating after its recent strong gains and some profit-taking among last week's risers was expected.</p>
<p>Debt-mired Eurotunnel slipped in heavy business in its first day of trade after a massive restructuring deal was agreed with banks.</p>
<p>On the currency markets, the dollar was steadier after slipping lower against the mark in early European trade amid a bout of profit-taking from its September rally.</p>
<p>However, dealers said activity was light with the dollar likely to find strong support around the 1.52 mark area.</p>
<p>With no major U.S. economic data until Friday's producer prices and retail sales figures, dealers said the dollar will be susceptible to more profit-taking throughout the week.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar was steady around 111.00 yen, its session lows.</p>
<p>Monday's comments from senior Japanese politicians about raising rates after this month's general election were taken lightly by the market but have created an air of caution over aggressive yen sales, dealers said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.5244 marks and 111.12 yen compared with 1.5299 marks and 111.22 yen late in Europe on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares had fallen 8.9 points to 4,022.6.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index dropped 4.60 to 2,146.95.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was down 12.75 at 2,689.89.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $381.00 an ounce compared with $380.15 at the London close on Monday. Silver was unchanged at $4.90.</p>
