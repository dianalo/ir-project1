<p>British tobacco and insurance group B.A.T Industries Plc, defending a packet of lawsuits across the U.S., said on Thursday investigators would fail to unearth any documentary evidence showing it believed cigarettes were addictive.</p>
<p>B.A.T, which controls 17 percent of the U.S. cigarette market, worth 620 million (corrects from billion) pounds ($1 billion) or a quarter of its total profits last year, said a &quot;smoking gun&quot; would not be unearthed in a mountain of documents it has released over the past few years.</p>
<p>&quot;Millions of millions of documents have been made available to the plaintiffs' attorneys in the U.S.,&quot; B.A.T spokesman Ralph Edmondson said.</p>
<p>&quot;If there was anything that was relevant, I'm sure the attorneys would have brought it to the public's attention by now. I don't believe there is anything else to emerge.&quot;</p>
<p>Edmondson's comments follow news late Wednesday that a U.S. federal judge had reinstated an investors' lawsuit against Philip Morris Inc that claims the world's largest tobacco group hid negative information about smoking from shareholders.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit the plaintiffs said the company artificially inflated the stock price by maintaining the public stance &quot;that nicotine is not addictive (and)that smoking is entirely a matter of 'choice'&quot;.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey said he had restored the suit, originally dismissed in 1995, due to new evidence that specifically identified Philip Morris and tobacco industry documents discussing studies concerning whether cigarettes and nicotine are additive.</p>
<p>&quot;This new documentary evidence is of enough potential importance and volume that I probably would not have granted a defendants' motion to dismiss had it been described in the initial complaint,&quot; Mukasey said.</p>
<p>B.A.T, along with the rest of the tobacco industry, is embroiled in litigation from more than 20 U.S. state attorneys general who are trying to recoup state healthcare funds spent treating smoking-related illnesses. Alongside the state battles are several separate personal injury suits as well as a state-by-state collection of private class action suits.</p>
<p>B.A.T alone is spending $100 million a year on legal fees, which the company accepts as the price of doing business in a country where the catchphrase could be &quot;when in doubt, litigate&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just part of doing business there,&quot; Edmondson said. The company remained confident it would eventually extinguish the legal fires currently burning in heated U.S. courtrooms.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe we will prevail in the various lawsuits we are defending in the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>B.A.T shares, which were down 8-1/2p to 508 by midday, have dropped 11 percent since mid-March when U.S. rival Liggett Group became the first tobacco company to admit smoking was addictive and could cause cancer.</p>
<p>But analysts believe this latest development is just another &quot;nuisance&quot; suit which probably has little chance of success for the plaintiffs and that investors will wait until the smoke clears over the next few days before buying back the shares.</p>
<p>&quot;My initial reaction is this is just plain stupid,&quot; said Tom Bennett, tobacco analyst at Banque Paribas.</p>
<p>Bennett noted that tobacco companies in the U.S. had been required to put a health warning on cigarette packets since 1969. &quot;How on earth can shareholders claim companies have been hiding this and claiming something else.&quot;</p>
<p>Although B.A.T remains confident it will win its costly battles, chief executive Martin Broughton said last month that it would be sensible to evaluate any settlement which should cover all current and future claims and as approved by Congress and the White House.</p>
