<p>Singapore shares were mostly lower on profit taking on Friday morning, but electronics related stocks powerered on upwards.</p>
<p>Dealers said the hottest stock of the day was electronics contract manufacturer Venture, which rocketted more than 30 percent to a new high of Singapore $6.75 after announcing it was launching a new multi-media software.</p>
<p>It eased back to S$6.60, up S$1.45 with 1.81 million shares traded.  </p>
<p>An analyst with a British house said the new product would lift earnings but the sharp jump in the share price was a &quot;knee jerk&quot; reaction.</p>
<p>Creative Technolgy shares had roller-coaster session after the Venture news on fears that its business would be affected.</p>
<p>But analysts said the two companies were making different products and aimed at different ends of the market. Creative recovered from a low of S$34.80 to stand at S$36.00 at noon, down 50 cents.</p>
<p>Other electronic stocks also gained, including Sunright, which hit a new year high of S$3.00.</p>
