<p>French ex-soccer boss Bernard Tapie will start work on Monday as a salesman after a court on Friday allowed him to leave the prison where he is serving an eight-month term for rigging a game, his lawyer said.</p>
<p>Lawyer Henri Bollet told TF1 television that the court in the southern town of Aix-en-Provence had allowed Tapie to leave the jail during the day after he produced a six-month work contract.</p>
<p>Under French law, prisoners serving short terms may be allowed out of prison during the day if they find employment.</p>
<p>Tapie was hired for six months by a shipyard boss, Michel Bigoin, who once was part of the management of Tapie's former Marseille soccer club.</p>
<p>Tapie entered prison on February 3 after the supreme court rejected his appeal against imprisonment for rigging a league match between Marseille and Valenciennes in 1993.</p>
<p>He has appealed against another, six-month term for tax evasion regarding his luxury yacht.</p>
