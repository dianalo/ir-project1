<headline>Russian Eurobond roadshow in U.S. lacks spark.</headline>

<p>The New York roadshow for a planned Russian Eurobond failed to live up to the blockbuster London session that preceded it, market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The audience was smaller than we had expected,&quot; said a U.S. manager, who estimated about 150 to 180 investors attended the New York program, compared to some 450 in London.</p>
<p>In the question-and-answer session that followed a &quot;boiler- plate presentation,&quot; some tough questions were raised on whether Russia's tax collection would meet International Monetary Fund guidelines.  </p>
<p>A senior Russian official said the tax collection in the first half of November was 50 percent higher than the average of September and October. If that trend continues, IMF officials this week could make a &quot;positive recommendation&quot; to disburse the currently withheld October tranche of its scheduled loans to Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russians showed they understood that the revenues were below target and made efforts to tackle the financial problem,&quot; said another manager who attended the meeting. &quot;They were moving in the right direction.&quot;  </p>
<p>The response to the presentation gave no clue as to the final size and pricing of the Eurobond issue, according to sources who attended.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't show their hands,&quot; said a manager.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan and SBC/Warburg, are joint lead managers of the issue.</p>
<p>One manager said a Russian official had to backtrack from his initial response to a question about the seniority of the Eurobond among all the Russian debt obligations.  </p>
<p>At first, the official said the Eurobond would have a &quot;higher quality&quot; than previously issued debt, the manager said. But the official backtracked after realizing the &quot;pari passu&quot; clause in debt contracts gives all of them equal status.</p>
<p>Russian officials told the audience that the 1997 budget has not been set, but they aimed at registering a 2.0 percent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate, an annual inflation rate of 12.0 percent, and a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent of the GDP.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing we didn't already know before we went to the meeting,&quot; a manager said.</p>
<p>On the still unfolding drama of stolen Minfin bonds, Russian officials tried to reassure investors that government authorities at the highest level are determined to release the bonds soon.</p>
<p>The protracted reconciliation of the Vnesh loans is also said to be moving towards sending the first notice to holders, the sources said.</p>
<p>Arturo Porzecanski, chief economist of emerging markets at ING Baring Securities, Inc., said the long drawn-out anticipation and year-end timing may hurt the outcome of the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that the Eurobond has been anticipated for so long worked against it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Moreover, some investors have closed their books for the year, content to be on the sidelines, he added.</p>
<p>The lesson of a lackluster $750 million global bond offering by Brazil, which was also launched after lengthy anticipation, should make the issuer and underwriter mindful of setting a realistic goal, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They should not try to make a market where the market does not exist,&quot; he said.</p>
