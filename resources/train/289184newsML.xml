<p>British narrow money supply continued to rise steadliy in December, the Bank of England said on Monday, suggesting retailers enjoyed booming pre-Christmas sales and consumers will continue to be the driving force behind growth in 1997.</p>
<p>The Bank said M0 -- notes, coins and bankers balances at the BoE -- rose a provisional 0.9 percent month-on-month in December. This gave annual growth of 7.1 percent, down slightly from 7.3 percent in November.</p>
<p>Notes and coins rose 7.4 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>&quot;(The data) point to a reasonably buoyant month in the high street, while the pattern of notes and coins during the month ...supports the anecdotal evidence from retailers of a last minute pre-Christmas rush in sales,&quot; said HSBC Markets economist Jonathan Loynes.</p>
<p>Economists said the data would add only minimal pressure on Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke to raise interest rates near term.</p>
<p>&quot;M0 is low down the authorities' list of favourite indicators,&quot; said Loynes.</p>
<p>&quot;But if the picture of strong sales is supported by the retail surveys from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) over the next week, Clarke will find himself under heavy pressure to raise base rates in either January or February.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George are due to hold their next regular monetary policy meeting on January 15.</p>
<p>Economists are divided on the likelihood of a rise in interest rates after the meeting, but agree one will have to come before the general election -- which must be held by May -- if rampant consumer spending is to be curbed.</p>
<p>General Accident economist Andrew Milligan said M0 would take a back seat at the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there is no close month on month correlation between M0 and retail sales growth, the narrow money supply figures have tied in with the upturn in consumer spending seen so far in 1996,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As the good consumer spending trend remains intact, other factors such as the strength of sterling and signs that manufacturing output is peaking will be more important for Clarke's decision about raising rates in January or February.&quot;</p>
<p>Schroders economist David Philpotts said all the evidence was pointing in the same direction -- that consumers remain buoyant and are prepared to take on more debt.</p>
<p>&quot;With lower taxes coming, the housing market flourishing and any interest rate rises unlikely to be severe, there looks like there is little on the horizon to change that picture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The next indication of sales growth in December comes on January 10 with the CBI's distributive trades survey. Actual retail sales data for the month is due on January 22.</p>
<p>At 7.1 percent annual growth, M0 remains firmly above the government's zero to four percent monitoring range.</p>
<p>Economists said a stronger than anticipated rise in bankers' balances with the Bank of England accounted for the higher than expected 0.9 percent monthly rise in M0.</p>
<p>The Bank warned that due to difficulties in assessing changes in seasonality in December, the seasonal adjustments may not remove the seasonal effects in the month as precisely as at other times of the year.</p>
