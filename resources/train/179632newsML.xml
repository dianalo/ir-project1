<p>Prime Minister John Major warned on Monday Britain would block any deal on European Union reforms unless it got its way in an argument over working hours.</p>
<p>Britain is awaiting Tuesday's European Court ruling on whether the EU can restrict British workers' average working week to no more than 48 hours. Britain argues working hours are a matter for employers and workers and Europe should not interfere.</p>
<p>But the court is widely expected to rule that the European Union directive limiting working hours is legal -- prompting a bitter new row with Major's government.</p>
<p>Major used a high-profile annual speech to the City of London Lord Mayor's banquet to deliver his strongest warning yet that Britain would demand changes to European treaties if the court rules in favour of limiting the working week.</p>
<p>&quot;If the court rules against us, we will require changes in European law to reinforce Britain's protection from such legislation,&quot; Major told leading bankers and businessmen.</p>
<p>&quot;Our partners know that. And they know that we shall insist upon these changes before we can conclude any new agreements at the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) next year.&quot;</p>
<p>The ruling Conservatives, trailing the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls with just six months before the latest possible date for a general election, are bitterly split on Europe.</p>
<p>Major has been forced to take a tough line against Brussels to placate right-wingers in his party ranks who are bitterly opposed to any moves towards further European integration.</p>
<p>If the Luxembourg-based court rules against Britain, Major is expected to come under even fiercer pressure from these so-called Eurosceptics, enraged at what they see as Europe's creeping encroachment on British sovereignty.</p>
<p>Major is angry the working week rules were brought in under European health and safety provisions -- provisions which allowed Britain to be outvoted by its European partners.</p>
<p>Britain has told the court that the issue has nothing to do with health and safety, and was therefore wrongly adopted.</p>
<p>Major claims as one of his key achievements -- and one of his party's defining differences with Labour -- his negotiation of Britain's right to opt out of working practices legislation enshrined in the European Union's so-called Social Chapter.</p>
<p>His threat carried echoes of Britain's tactic of blocking EU business this summer until it got a timetable to end the export ban Europe imposed on British beef because of mad cow disease.</p>
<p>But British officials said they do not now expect months of disruption in the IGC. Instead, talks would proceed, but Britain would block a final deal unless treaty changes were accepted.</p>
<p>Commentators said Major's threat was unlikely to carry much weight with Britain's European partners, as IGC negotiations will not end until after the general election -- and the polls show Major has an electoral mountain to climb.</p>
<p>Major also used Monday's speech to drive home what is expected to be his main campaign message, that Britain's economy is the best in Europe and getting better.</p>
<p>But he said the November budget, the last before the election, would be &quot;prudent and sensible&quot;, a clear hint no significant tax giveaways are expected.</p>
<p>The opposition accused Major of trying to ignore years of economic mismanagement. &quot;Britain is falling behind in Europe,&quot; said Alistair Darling, one of Labour's key economic spokesmen.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now ninth in the European prosperity league. We are paying the price of economic failure.&quot;</p>
