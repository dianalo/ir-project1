<p>Australia completed a clinical 5-0 demolition of the Czech Republic in their Davis Cup quarter-final tie on Sunday when Mark Philippoussis and Pat Rafter won their reverse singles matches.</p>
<p>Australian number one Philippoussis overpowered Martin Damm 6-4 6-2 in the first of the reverse singles before Rafter beat David Rikl 7-6 0-6 6-2.</p>
<p>Philippoussis needed just 66 minutes to topple Damm on the Memorial Drive grass court while Rafter fought back after a sluggish start to overcome Rikl, a lowly-ranked player better known for his doubles play.</p>
<p>The tie was effectively over on Saturday when world number one doubles pair Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde beat Damm and Rikl 4-6 6-1 7-5 6-4 to give the hosts an unbeatable 3-0 lead.</p>
<p>Australia now face a likely semifinal against the United States, who were leading 2-1 in their quarter-final against the Netherlands at Newport Beach in California.</p>
<p>Australia, winners of the international men's team event 26 times, had endured mixed Davis Cup fortunes in recent years.</p>
<p>Relegated from the elite 16-team world group after losing to Hungary in 1995, they fought their way back through regional qualifiers last year.</p>
<p>Their renaissance was confirmed when Australia upset holders France 4-1 in the opening round of this year's competition in February.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic's campaign was hit by the refusal of Petr Korda, Daniel Vacek, Bohdan Ulihrach and Slava Dosedel to play in the tie.</p>
<p>The team's fortunes dipped even further on Friday when Jiri Novak was forced to withdraw from his match against Philippoussis with a virus and was replaced by Rikl.</p>
