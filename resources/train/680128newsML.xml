<p>China's A and B share morning gains were erased by the afternoon suspension of Shenzhen A share market giant Shenzhen Development Bank after volatile price movements last Friday and this morning, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Shanghai B index edged up 0.434 points or 0.51 percent to 85.481 points, but off an intraday high of 86.910. The A index dipped 8.466 points or 0.63 percent to 1,340.684 points.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen B index lost 0.88 points or 0.59 percent to 148.27 after hitting a high of 152.50 and the A share index inched up 0.43 points or 0.10 percent to 450.40, but was off an intra-session high of 467.63 scored in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Shenzhen) A share market gave up much of its early gains in the afternoon after the Shenzhen Stock Exchange suspended trading in the bank for its volatile price movements,&quot; an analyst at China Guotai Securities said.</p>
<p>A Shenzhen stock exchange official said the bank was suspended from trading due to &quot;abnormal&quot; price fluctuations, and trading in the stock would resume on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;People had thought the government would not crack down on the market ahead of the reversion of Hong Kong, but the suspension of Shenzhen Development Bank warned them again, which resulted in a more cautious mood,&quot; said one Shanghai broker.</p>
<p>Trading in the bank was suspended for five sessions until last Friday due to trading irregularities. It ended up 10 percent on Friday due in part to optimism over its earnings record, brokers said.</p>
<p>It extended gains on Monday morning, up 7.77 percent at 36.60 yuan on volume of 28 million shares, to become the second most actively traded counter.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are going to stay on the sidelines early Tuesday to monitor the bank's performance,&quot; another analyst at a Chinese brokerage said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will put downward pressure on the overall market if it falls sharply because it is so heavily index weighted,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Fallout from the bank suspension should be offset by euphoria in the final days before the Hong Kong handover at midnight on June 30, and expectations the central government would not announce any harsh new measures to bring down share prices in the short term, brokers said.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai B share market, Huaxin Cement was the star on speculative buying, rising $0.010 or 4.76 percent to $0.220 on thin volume of 34,000 shares.</p>
<p>Newcomer Jinan Qingqi Motorcycle was the most actively traded on bargain-hunting, edging up $0.002 or 0.37 percent to $0.538 on volume of 4.1 million shares.</p>
<p>In the Shenzhen B share market, Jiangling Motors was the biggest loser, falling HK$0.21 or 5.75 percent to HK$3.44.</p>
<p>($1=8.3 yuan, $1=HK$7.8)</p>
