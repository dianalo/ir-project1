<p>British department store group House of Fraser Plc will not make any further restructuring charges and will hand back unused provisions as exceptional credits, chief executive John Coleman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very confident that we have got sufficient to cover the full restructuring programme...if we don't use them all, which we hopefully won't, then we will hand them back as exceptional credits,&quot; Coleman said in an interview.</p>
<p>House of Fraser earlier reported pretax profits for the year ending January 25 of 14.8 million stg before exceptional charges of 53.2 million stg, against a profit of 14.3 million stg a year ago.  </p>
<p>Coleman said no more store closures were planned and that talks were underway on the sale of three stores announced in January.</p>
<p>The refurbished Leeds store, Coleman said, was seeing sales up 70 percent on a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Leeds carries on running at more than 70 percent up on last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Coleman said the first phase of the group's restructuring brought cost savings of 10 million stg a year and the second phase should bring more.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective of phase two is two-fold, it's to increase customer service and to save more money,&quot; he said, partly through more flexible staffing.</p>
<p>The struggling House of Fraser, which has 51 stores across Britain, is trying to reverse its fortunes by attacking costs and revamping its buying strategy.</p>
<p>Coleman said private label ranges of clothing for men and women would be introduced into stores in the autumn and that he hoped these could eventually account for a quarter of fashion sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Private label will only ever be a minority percentage of our sales...but we might see private label reaching as much as 25 percent of our fashion sales,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>House of Fraser said in a statement with its annual results that current sales were up to expectations and Coleman said the group was &quot;quietly confident, quietly happy with our sales performance so far.&quot;</p>
