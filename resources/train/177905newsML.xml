<p>Hizbollah guerrillas killed one Israeli soldier and wounded two on Saturday in the deadliest raid in south Lebanon in more than two weeks, pro-Israeli Lebanese militia sources said.</p>
<p>An Israeli army spokesman confirmed that a soldier was killed in clashes in southern Lebanon but gave no details.</p>
<p>The Shi'ite Moslem fighters opened machinegun and anti-tank rocket fire at an Israeli post at Blat in the western sector of Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone, hitting a tank and causing the casualties, South Lebanon Army (SLA) sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the Sagger missiles scored a direct hit, destroying a tank and killing one soldier and wounding two,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>It was the bloodiest assault by pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas against Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon since two soldiers were killed and four wounded when a Hizbollah bomb hit their patrol on October 25.</p>
<p>Saturday's raid came on the eve of &quot;Martyr's Day&quot; when Hizbollah commemorates fighters killed in confrontations with Israeli forces on the last active Arab-Israeli front.</p>
<p>Israeli gunners retaliated by lobbing 120-mm and 155-mm artillery shells at the outskirts of four Shi'ite villages where guerrillas are active north of the zone.</p>
<p>Hizbollah said in a statement in Beirut that one civilian man was wounded in the village of Yater by the shelling. There was no independent confirmation.</p>
<p>Earlier, Hizbollah claimed responsibility for the Blat raid in a statement that said its guerrillas rained down anti-tank rockets and machinegun fire at the post, destroying a Mirkava tank and &quot;killing and wounding a number of soldiers.&quot;</p>
<p>The group said hours later its gunners fired at Israeli forces at Blat again and at Basseel outpost and its snippers also hit an SLA militiaman in another sector of the zone. There was no immediate independent confirmation.</p>
<p>Hizbollah, funded and armed by Iran, leads a guerrilla war to oust Israeli and SLA forces from the 15-km (nine-mile) deep zone. The group is opposed to Arab-Israeli peace talks.</p>
<p>Some 1,000 Israeli troops and the 3,000-strong SLA patrol the zone extending from Mount Hermon in the east to the Mediterranean. It was set up in 1985 to deter cross-border guerrilla raids on northern Israeli settlements.</p>
<p>Israel launched a massive 17-day military operation against Hizbollah in April that killed 200 Lebanese, mostly civilians. A U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement ended the Israeli bombardment and Hizbollah Katyusha rocket attacks on Israel.</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement bars Hizbollah and Israelis from launching attacks against or from civilian areas but allows guerrilla raids on Israeli troops in south Lebanon and gives both sides the right of self-defence.</p>
