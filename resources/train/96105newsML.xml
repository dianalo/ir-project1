<headline>Mauritius sugar stocks strong, index down.</headline>
<dateline>PORT LOUIS 1996-10-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sugar stocks continued to surge on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius on Friday in anticipation of record receipts from the country's sugar exports in 1996/97 but trading volume remained thin, bourse officials said.</p>
<p>The market index, Semdex, was down 0.57 points to 316.87 on lower turnover of 3.93 million rupees on 228,213 shares from 5.93 million rupees on 405,364 shares on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Mauritius Sugar Syndicate has forecast a record 8.1 billion rupees of sugar exports in 1996/97, up from 6.9 billion in 1995/96.</p>
<p>There was little trade in most sugar stocks, and a bourse official said the higher indicated prices reflected reluctance to sell.</p>
<p>Mon Desert Alma (ordinary) jumped 5.0 rupees to 95 on 10 shares, while Mon Desert Alma (preference) was shown up 3.50 rupees to 80.50, Mount was quoted 50 cents up to 17.50 rupees and Savannah (preference) 5 rupees higher at 105, but none of them was traded.</p>
<p>Mon Tresor Mon Desert, another sugar stock, was unchanged at 35 rupees on 3,100 shares.</p>
<p>Mauritius Oil Refineries continued its upward movement, gaining 50 cents to 9.70 rupees on 77,905 shares. The refineries stock was boosted last week after the company reported a 57 percent rise in pre-tax profit for the year ending 30 June 1996, brokers said.</p>
<p>New Mauritius Hotels was 40 cents higher to 27.50 rupees on 35,925 shares.</p>
<p>But these upward moving stocks were offset by losses to heavyweight shares on the Semdex, resulting in the index ending lower on Friday, bourse officials said.</p>
<p>Mauritius Commercial Bank shed 50 cents to 71 rupees on 6,632 shares. Investment-based Promotion And Development (PAD) was off 10 cents to 15 rupees on 450 shares.</p>
<p>Conglomerate Rogers was 50 cents lower to 88.50 rupees on 50 shares and Ireland Blyth lost 10 cents to 12.30 rupees on 1,150 shares.</p>
<p>Happy World Foods eased 10 cents to 14 rupees on 3,610 shares and national carrier Air Mauritius fell one rupee to 49 on 410 shares.</p>
<p>Leading stocks which ended flat included State Bank of Mauritius at 8.50 rupees on 45,849 shares, Fincorp Investment at 71 rupees on 1,940 shares, National Investment Trust (NIT) at 11 rupees on 10,680 shares and hotel concern Sun Resorts at 35.70 rupees on 5,000 shares.</p>
