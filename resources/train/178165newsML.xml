<title>PAKISTAN: Pakistan top policemen named in Murtaza's murder.</title>
<headline>Pakistan top policemen named in Murtaza's murder.</headline>
<dateline>KARACHI, Pakistan 1996-11-09</dateline>

<p>Supporters of Murtaza Bhutto, slain brother of Pakistan's sacked prime minister Benazir Bhutto, filed a formal complaint on Saturday accusing senior policemen of his killing, police said.</p>
<p>They said Noor Mohammad, an official of Murtaza's breakaway faction of the Pakistan People's Party, named senior police officials including the chief of Karachi police Shoaib Suddle in the killing of Murtaza and his seven companions.</p>
<p>Murtaza Bhutto was killed on September 20 in what the police said was an exchange of fire with his armed guards. Murtaza supporters disputes the claim and say that their party leader was killed in cold blood.</p>
<p>&quot;The police showed the killing of Murtaza in a fake encounter and did not allow us to lodge a formal complaint,&quot; a spokesman of the Shaheed Bhutto group told Reuters. &quot;Since the Benazir Bhutto government has been removed, we hope to get justice.&quot;</p>
<p>Noor Mohammad in his complaint, lodged 49 days after the incident, said that political opponents of Murtaza Bhutto in the federal and the Sindh provincial government had conspired to eliminate him in league with the accused police officers and Masood Sharif, chief of the Intelligence Bureau.</p>
<p>Masood Sharif was detained soon after Benazir Bhutto's government was dismissed by President Farooq Leghari on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Murtaza's party spokesman said a detailed statement would be given to the police about the case once an investigative officer had been appointed.</p>
