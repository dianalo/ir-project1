<p>U.S. spot fuel oil prices mostly fell slightly Friday despite another rally in crude, pressured by abundant supplies and mediocre demand though East Coast temperatures were expected to dip next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals for resid are not great. There's oil all over and a lot of tanks are full,&quot; said one cash trader, noting colder weather next week could spur better utility burns and help trim inventories.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent eased slightly to about $21.75 a barrel, with January one percent paper sold early at $21.15 and later at $21.50, up 50 cents with crude.  </p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York were steady to down slightly, with 2.2 percent pegged a quarter lower at about $18.25.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour eased slightly to about the $22.75 level, traders said.</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf Coast one percent also was modestly lower at $18.50 or under, while three percent notionally was steady to up slightly at $15.75-16.00. No USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>Traders said USG refinery problems like Star's damaged H-oil unit in Louisiana and increased Latin American supplies could keep HSFO on the defensive for a while though prices seemed to have stabilized for now.</p>
<p>New York city gate weekend gas prices firmed five to 10 cents Friday to the $4.05-4.10/mmBtu area compared to NYH one percent resid at a $3.46/mmBtu equivalent. For January, New York gas traded at $1.80 over the screen, or about $5.40-5.50/mmBtu, well-above resid paper at a $3.41/mmBtu equivalent.</p>
