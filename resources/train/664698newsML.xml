<p>		     DAY'S RANGE * SUPPORT * RESTNCE* MA-25 * MA-200</p>
<p> TT Group	    375-385   *   355   *   400  *  367 *   337</p>
<p>---------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - June 16 --------------</p>
<p>+ TT Group shares are in a long-term uptrend which should take them to 450p once the 400p area has been successfully negotiated, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>+ The shares have a volatile history despite the uptrend but their 200 day moving average confirm the general direction for the shares is up. The stock is in the Mid-250 index.</p>
<p>An uptrend in shares of diversified industrials company TT Group looks strong enough to take them to 450p over the medium-to-long-term, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent resistance at 375p has now been penetrated (on June 10), opening the way for further advances to challenge the 400p mark,&quot; said Richard Marshall, a director at Investment Research of Cambridge Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;A successful challenge on the 400p level looks likely and there looks no reason why the next target at 450p will not be achieved in due course,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>By 1000 GMT, TT Group shares were up 2p to 382-1/2p.</p>
<p>TT Group has interests in electronics, packaging and building services products and desite the stock's long-term uptrend, the shares have had a bumpy ride, analysts noted.</p>
<p>Ten day historic volatility for the stock is currently 17 percent but it had been as high as 35 percent at the start of the year and yet the overall share price trend since 1993 has been upwards.</p>
<p>After outperforming the All-Share index in 1993, the shares have managed to roughly stay in-line with the market since then.</p>
<p>But over the past 12 months they have not kept up with the market and have declined by 11.6 percent but Marshall believes the stock's fortunes may be about to change as the stock's various moving averages are turning higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The relative strength is (now) in a gentle uptrend and the 200 day moving average lends support to corrections,&quot; said Marshall.</p>
<p>The shares are a constituent of the Mid-250 index of medium capitalised stocks.</p>
