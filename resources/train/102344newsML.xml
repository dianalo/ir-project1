<p>Zapatista rebel leaders held last-minute talks with mediators in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas on Tuesday about a controversial first trip to Mexico's capital that could result in their arrest.</p>
<p>News reports from the Zapatistas' remote jungle base near the border with Guatemala said members of COCOPA, an all-party legislative commission for peace in Chiapas, were trying to negotiate with the Zapatistas about their plan to leave for Mexico City.</p>
<p>Radio Red, a private radio network, said commission members refused to speak to reporters in the area about the progress of the talks.</p>
<p>Chief government spokesman Dionisio Perez Jacome said the Zapatista commanders would be arrested if they left Chiapas without first agreeing the journey with the government.</p>
<p>The rebel commanders, including their masked leader Subcommander Marcos, planned to attend an Indian rights forum in the capital grouping more than 1,000 Indian representatives until Saturday.</p>
<p>The Zapatistas hope to arrive in a blaze of publicity, making it difficult for the government to arrest them.</p>
<p>The proposed rebel trip has presented a challenge to President Ernesto Zedillo's government, which has pursued peace talks on and off with the rebels for more than a year.</p>
<p>Analysts say the government is caught between a need to apply the law to armed rebels who have not yet signed a peace accord and a desire not to hurt the stalled peace process any further -- which would draw fire from rights groups and the Zapatistas' international supporters.</p>
<p>Peace negotiations broke down in early September after the rebels accused the government of acting in bad faith and no date has been agreed for them to restart.</p>
<p>Perez said the amnesty law which allowed peace talks with the rebels only suspended the arrest warrants against them if the rebels remained in the area of conflict, Chiapas, and were engaged in dialogue with the government.</p>
<p>So a journey to the capital, at a time when the talks were suspended, would break the terms of the law, he added.</p>
<p>Business and church leaders have also spoken out in recent days against a Zapatista journey to Mexico City, saying the rebels should not move outside Chiapas until they have concluded a final peace agreement with the government.</p>
<p>Groups sympathetic to the rebels have promised the rebels a warm welcome.</p>
