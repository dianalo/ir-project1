<p>Thai stocks slid for the sixth straight trading day to close at a new 6-1/3 year low as foreigners continued to sell shares following the central bank's revision of lower economic growth, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite SET index ended down 13.25 points or 2.19 percent to 592.18 on Monday. Turnover was modest with 3.46 billion baht changing hands.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank's projection of lower economic growth of six percent sparked selling today,&quot; said one broker at United Securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market expects the economic growth to be lower (than six percent) as exports remain sluggish,&quot; the broker added.</p>
<p>The closing level on the SET was the lowest since January 1991. Losers led gainers 231 to 73 with 85 issues ending unchanged.</p>
<p>Bank of Thailand governor Rerngchai Marakanond was quoted as saying the country's gross domestic product (GDP) should grow about six percent in 1997.</p>
<p>The central bank earlier projected the GDP growth to be at 6.8 percent this year.  </p>
<p>Thai Farmers Bank eased five baht to 104 on the most active trade of 290 million baht.</p>
<p>Thailand's largest bank, Bangkok Bank lost four to 159 and Krung Thai Bank ws down one to 25.75.</p>
<p>Electricity Generating gained 0.50 to 57. The company on Monday announced a net profit of 460 million baht in the first quarter compared with 286 million in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>TelecomAsia dropped 3.50 to 31.50, Shinawatra Computer and Communication fell two to 132.</p>
