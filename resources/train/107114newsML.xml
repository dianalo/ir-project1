<p>Homicide detectives on Thursday were investigating the beating of former world welterweight boxing champion Don Jordan, who was reported to be in a coma 11 days after the assault.</p>
<p>Officials at the Harbour-UCLA Medical Centre declined to discuss Jordan's condition, but the Los Angeles Times quoted friends and relatives as saying the 62-year-old ex-fighter was in critical condition on life-support in the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Jordan, the one-time &quot;Geronimo Kid&quot; who won the world welterweight title in 1958 from Virgil Akins, was beaten in broad daylight on Sept. 30 in the Los Angeles suburb of Wilmington, a tough waterfront neighbourhood, police said.</p>
<p>A Los Angeles police spokesman said the case had been taken over by homicide investigators and that they had several leads, including witnesses.</p>
<p>Even though Jordan had not died as a result of the beating, it was considered a serious enough crime for the homicide squad to get involved, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Detectives told the Times that robbery may have been the motive and that a weapon, possibly a pipe, was used.</p>
<p>Jordan defended his title successfully in a rematch with Akins but only held the world title for two years before his career went into a tail-spin.</p>
<p>His last fight in 1962 ended with Jordan hitting the canvas in the first round and staying down.</p>
<p>He was disqualified for &quot;not trying&quot; but an investigation failed to prove he took a dive. Jordan later denied in an interview with the Times he had thrown the fight.</p>
