<title>CAYMAN ISLANDS: Profits up at Ugland International.</title>
<headline>Profits up at Ugland International.</headline>
<dateline>GEORGE TOWN, Grand Cayman 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Publicly traded Ugland International Holdings, parent company of Ugland Shipping Ltd, on Wednesday announced pre-tax profits of $4.6 million (three million stg) for the final nine months of 1996.</p>
<p>For the same period in 1995, pre-tax profits were $1.92 million.</p>
<p>The company, which moved its headquarters to the Cayman Islands from London in early 1996, has used a nine-month report to coincide with its move. UHI shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>Ugland also announced it had sales of $101.1 million for the same period, compared with sales of $46.1 million for the last nine months of 1995. The divided paid for the last nine months of 1996 was 4.72 pence.</p>
<p>Ugland chief executive officer David Palmer said the improved sales and earnings were attributed to the group's restructuring and concentration on its core business of seaborne vehicle transportation and refrigerator cargo carriers.</p>
<p>Palmer also said investment over the nine month period was 133.6 million stg.  </p>
<p>He also announced that Sir Graham day had joined Ugland International Holdings as non-executive deputy chairman. Board chairman Andreas Ugland said the earnings picture &quot;was a good start for the restructured business, which confirms our strategy of concentrating on two core activities.</p>
<p>&quot;The first three months of 1997 have also seen a sustained strong perfomance from the vehicle transportation and trading in line with expectations for the reefer business. I am confident about the outlook for 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>Ugland Shipping is one of the world's largest shipping companies of vehicles and refrigerated cargo.</p>
