<p>A Malaysian High Court on Thursday ordered the immediate release from jail of 10 human rights activists detained after last weekend's disruption of an East Timor conference by a pro-government youth mob.</p>
<p>The Kuala Lumpur High Court overturned a Magistrates Court order on Wednesday that would have kept the activists in jail until Saturday to allow police to investigate whether to bring charges against them and to identify ringleaders.</p>
<p>&quot;The detention is illegal as at now and they should be released immediately and not held another second,&quot; High Court Judge V.C. Vohrah said in his order.</p>
<p>His order said the police had not specified in their request why the detainees had been arrested in the first place and why they needed to be detained longer.</p>
<p>Vohra also said the police did not show a convincing record that they were intensively investigating the detainees to justify keeping them in jail longer.</p>
<p>The Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor II (APCET II) was broken up on Saturday soon after it started, when youths allied to the government stormed the meeting at a Kuala Lumpur hotel, overturning furniture and manhandling participants.</p>
<p>Police detained more than 100 conference participants, journalists and protesters. Police released the protesters on Saturday. The 46 foreign participants were deported. All but 10 of the activists had been released earlier this week.</p>
<p>APCET II aimed to focus attention on East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the next year -- a move never recognised by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The conference was held ahead of Tuesday's anniversary of the 1991 killing by Indonesian troops of at least 50 demonstrators in East Timor's capital of Dili.</p>
<p>The Malaysian government had objected to the conference, saying it could harm ties with neighbouring Indonesia, but stopped short of outrightly banning it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the chairman of the youth wing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party on Thursday defended the storming of the East Timor conference, saying the youths had to act to protect their government's credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear and blatant that the non-governmental organisations involved (in the conference) were least concerned or bothered about the government's stand,&quot; Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, UMNO youth chief, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Ahmad had earlier taken responsibility for ordering the youths to stop the conference from proceeding.</p>
<p>The 10 detainees issued a statement before their release, accusing police of standing by while the youths demonstrated against the conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Through this dastardly affair, the Malaysian government has exposed its own double standards on human rights in the world,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;We the Malaysian NGOs (non-governmental organisations) who are concerned to find a path to peace in East Timor are merely trying to practice what the prime minister preaches about defending human rights in South Africa, Palestine, Bosnia and elsewhere,&quot; the statement said.</p>
