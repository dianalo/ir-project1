<p>Tajikistan's secular government and the Islamic opposition have begun an exchange of prisoners under a peace deal ending a four-year civil war in the former Soviet republic, a United Nations official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Seven government prisoners were exchanged late on Friday for seven opposition fighters. Each side also released 20 persons on Saturday morning,&quot; an official from the U.N. mission of observers told Reuters.</p>
<p>The official said the exchanges had taken place near the settlement of Childara, 160 km (100 miles) east of Dushanbe.</p>
<p>He said the prisoner exchange had been started in line with a final peace agreement signed in Moscow on June 27.</p>
<p>The peace deal, brokered by Iran, Russia and the United Nations, put an end to the civil war, in which tens of thousands people were killed and many more were forced to flee their homes for safety in neighbouring Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Under the peace deal, each side has to release 50 prisoners at the first stage of exchange.</p>
<p>The government says about 2,000 its servicemen are being held by the opposition. The opposition says up to 600 its fighters are in government prisons.</p>
