<p>Chinese Premier Li Peng left on Thursday for a three-day visit to Russia that officials said marked the inauguration of a system of regular meetings between prime ministers of the neighbouring nuclear powers.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the main focus of Li's trip would be to boost economic links and pave the way for a presidential summit next year.</p>
<p>Li could become the first foreign leader to meet Yeltsin since the Russian president's return to work on Monday from heart surgery, setting the stage for a visit to Moscow by Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit marks the formal inauguration of a regular meeting mechanism between the prime ministers of China and Russia,&quot; the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>Although politics will take a back seat on this visit, that official viewpoint underlined how much both China and Russia stand to gain in a delicate balancing act of their political ties with the West, analysts said.</p>
<p>Li is accompanied by Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Minister of the State Planning Commission Chen Jinhua as well several deputy ministers and officials in charge of China's nuclear and aviation industries -- sectors of great potential cooperation.</p>
<p>Officials of both sides have said economic ties have failed to keep pace with the rapid improvement in political links between the former rivals for world communist leadership.</p>
<p>Two-way trade was a modest $6.38 billion in the first nine months of this year, only a small portion of China's nearly $200 billion worth of trade over the same period.</p>
<p>State media said this week China and Russia were working on a plan to boost cross-border trade by setting up a special zone in the northeastern Chinese city of Suifenhe that would allow free movement for traders.</p>
<p>Trade between China and Russia through Suifenhe amounted to 2.1 billion yuan ($253.0 million) between January and August.</p>
<p>The two nations are also haggling over big-ticket items from nuclear power plants to a natural gas pipeline, and Li's visit may not yield a breakthrough, analysts said.</p>
<p>Russian officials in Beijing said there was still a wide gap between the two sides on a previously agreed on plan for China to buy Russian nuclear technology.</p>
<p>Beijing wants the multibillion dollar deal to use as little cash as possible while Moscow, badly in need of hard currency, is pushing for a more generous payment.</p>
<p>China has said it would switch the site of a nuclear plant using Russian technology in a move that is expected to make the project more commercially viable and ease some of the financial concerns, analysts said.</p>
<p>Russia is looking to make headway on a plan to build a pipeline to carry Siberian natural gas to China while it is also seeking a role in this country's huge Three Gorges dam project.</p>
<p>Officials and analysts said the visit would also have a political theme.</p>
<p>While the two sides need to foster their relations with the West they must also demonstrate some independence to strengthen their hand domestically and on the international stage.</p>
<p>The Russian government has come under pressure from its communist and nationalist opposition alike to abandon what is seen as a pro-Western stance and renew its ties with the former ally of the communist era.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Beijing said China had a similar interest in showing it had alternatives to the West, although it would use this lever cautiously.</p>
