<p>Turkey's car sector, already pressured by surging imports, faces an additional threat to its future this week as the government seeks to push through a plan allowing duty-free imports of used cars, industry officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The sector is already losing its power of competition. If you add to this the duty-free imports we will lose more and more,&quot; said Ercan Tezer, the head of Turkey's Automobile Industrialists Association (OSD), which fears massive job losses and a dive in car sales if the scheme goes ahead.</p>
<p>Since implementation of the customs union with the European Union in January new cars originating in EU countries can be imported duty-free, while new cars from other countries are subject to duty averaging around 30 percent. Second-hand car imports are restricted and attract 30 percent duty.</p>
<p>Under the new scheme the three million-strong Turkish expatriate workforce in Europe would be able to import cars up to four years old without customs duties, if they deposit at least 50,000 marks ($33,000) for one year at the central bank. The funds would accrue interest and be paid back in marks.</p>
<p>The government has already sought President Suleyman Demirel's approval for the decree, which is aimed at bringing in badly-needed revenues to curb the country's huge deficits.</p>
<p>Turkey's cash-rich workers abroad, mainly in Germany, who generally deposit their savings in German banks or buy real estate in Turkey, would also benefit from a 20 percent tax discount on the ad valorem tax levied on the sales of imported cars.</p>
<p>Tezer forecast 50,000 cars annually would enter Turkey under the plan, with each car likely to cost the job of one worker in the sector as the imports damage domestic car sales.</p>
<p>The automobile sector employs about 400,000 workers in 16 production plants and nearly 500 spare-parts sub-contractors.</p>
<p>&quot;This decree is not only going to harm manufacturers, it will damage the whole sector: component manufacturers, dealers and importers as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The sector is already struggling to combat the sharp rise in imports, which jumped to 17.2 percent of the 138,750 car sales in the first eight months of the year from 4.9 percent a year earlier. Industry analysts expect imports to account for 25 percent of the market by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The import surge follows the implementation of Turkey's customs union with the European Union in January, which is rapidly eroding the dominance of the local market by domestic manufacturers Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS, jointly owned by Italy's Fiat Spa and Turkey's Koc Holding AS, and Oyak-Renault AS, 57-percent owned by the French car maker Renault SA and 43-percent by the Turkish armed forces pension fund OYAK.</p>
<p>Turkey's car-makers manufactured 206,926 vehicles in the first eight months of this year, up 12 percent over the same 1995 period. Their stocks are growing and Tofas announced last week that it was suspending production for two weeks because expectations of duty-free imports had hit sales.</p>
<p>Government officials say the industry's negative reaction to the scheme is exaggerated. At the weekend, the parliamentary budget planning commission chairman Ertan Yulek forecast a duty-free import level of 25,000 vehicles, bringing in 1.3 billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's totally unnecessary to make such a fuss over 25,000 cars,&quot; Yulek told state-run Anatolian news agency.</p>
<p>Islamist premier Necmettin Erbakan told journalists last week he was determined to go ahead with the project, which he hopes will bring in badly-needed foreign currency.</p>
<p>Since coming to power in the summer the government has announced a series of revenue-raising measures to support an economy burdened by annual inflation of over 80 percent and swelling budget and trade deficits.</p>
<p>The automobile sector is acting together against the plans and has sent to Erbakan a report detailing its views, according to Tezer, who said he expects President Demirel to decide this week whether to approve the scheme.</p>
<p>Tezer said he is still hopeful there will be no changes to the present import regime, under which cars with a maximum age of three years can be imported by paying customs duties.</p>
