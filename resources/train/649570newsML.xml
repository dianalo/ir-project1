<p>Monthly inflation for May could have been around two to three percent last month if a rise in some food prices has been smaller, a NSI official who declined to be named told Reuters.</p>
<p>Prices of fresh fruits rose 22.1 percent in May month on month, vegetables rose 89 percent with potatoes posting the biggest price rise of 125 percent.</p>
<p>Meat prices increased 9.3 percent last month.</p>
<p>Consumer price inflation for 1997 was assumed at 566 percent in this year's draft budget yet to be approved by parliament. Annual inflation for 1996 was 310.8 percent.</p>
<p>Inflation projections were made under a fixed exchange rate of 1,000 levs per mark, to be introduced on July 1 along with a currency board arrangement recommended by the International Monetary Fund to stabilise the economy.</p>
<p>Inflation was expected to slow down under the currency board system as central bank lending to the government and commercial banks would be banned to prevent the printing of money. -- Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 911 88</p>
