<p>The dollar closed higher in Europe, boosted by a larger-than-expected drop in the U.S. trade deficit in October, traders said.</p>
<p>The overall trade deficit shrank 30.2 percent to $7.99 billion from a revised $11.44 billion in September -- the lowest monthly deficit in seven months since $7.87 billion in March and well below the average market forecast of $10.4 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The much better-than-expected headline number clearly boosted the dollar,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic at DKB International.</p>
<p>However, the details of the trade report showed the politically sensitive trade gap with Japan surging again.  </p>
<p>The gap rose 30.9 percent to $4.96 billion, the highest since August 1995, due to increased car and car parts imports. Some U.S. manufacturers charge Japan is deliberately manipulating its currency to keep the yen's value low and make its products cheaper for American importers. &quot;Dollar/yen will struggle to make further headway on these figures, especially since they reinforce the Japanes figures from earlier this week,&quot; said Stamekovic, an economist at DKB.</p>
<p>Japan on Wednesday said its surplus on trade with the United States rose 30 percent in November from a year earlier to $3.31 billion as a cheaper yen helped fuel Japanese exports.  </p>
<p>Economic weakness among key U.S. trading partners in Europe and the strength of the dollar against most European currencies pushed the trade deficit with Western Europe up by 75 percent during October to $1.82 billion. At 1548 GMT the dollar was at 1.5605/13 marks and 114.05/15 yen versus1.5544/49 and 113.59/64 in late European on Wednesday. The Bundesbank kept interest rates steady, as expected, and set a slightly more restrictive M3 money supply target corridor. In a move aimed at smoothing the way to European monetary union, the Bundesbank said it would extend its money supply orientation to a two-year period.  </p>
<p>By doing so, the Bundesbank aims to bridge a possible period of market uncertainty in 1998. During that year, currencies which will enter EMU will be irrevocably fixed against each other, forcing those central banks affected to coordinate policy very closely until the European Central Bank takes over policy at the start of 1999. The M3 target corridor for 1997 was set at 3.5 to 6.5 percent, compared to 4.0 to 7.0 percent this year.</p>
