<p>Shanghai copper futures ended down in active trading on Thursday due to overnight losses on the London Metal Exchange (LME), traders said.</p>
<p>The most active July 1997 contract ended at 23,740 yuan ($2,861) per tonne, losing 230 yuan. It opened at 23,750 yuan, hitting an intraday high of 23,790 and a low of 23,710 yuan.</p>
<p>April fell 90 to 23,390, May 140 to 23,480, June 200 to 23,660 and August 200 to 23,750 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose sharply to 52,990 tonnes from 24,570.</p>
<p>Copper opened lower on LME losses and moved at those levels for most of the session, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Copper opened sharply down but did not fall further due to active buying at low levels,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many investors believe copper will not drop sharply in the first half of this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of Thursday's buying was short-covering orders because holders of those positions don't think there will be any further price falls,&quot; a second trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said many investors were eager to leave the metal market for the bullish stock market.</p>
<p>Analysts said they did not expect copper to fall further in the next few days.  </p>
<p>Aluminium ended down. April fell 100 yuan to 16,150 yuan ($1,946) per tonne and May 90 to 16,430 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 410 tonnes from 2,300 yuan per tonne.</p>
