<title>USA: KCBT wheat slips to lowest level since July 1994.</title>
<headline>KCBT wheat slips to lowest level since July 1994.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1997-06-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures slipped to the lowest level in almost three years, weakened by bearish spring wheat acreage data and spillover selling from tumbling CBOT soybeans.</p>
<p>Floor sources said continued reports of higher-than-expected yields in Kansas and Oklahoma wheat were also weighing on the market.</p>
<p>USDA put spring wheat acreage at a higher-than-expected 19.2 million acres. A Reuter survey of analysts had produced an average projection of 18.1 million acres. Soybean area was put at 70.9 million versus an average analysts' estimate of 68.4 million.</p>
<p>July dipped to a contract low of $3.31-1/2 a bushel, the lowest level for the nearby month since July 1994. At 1111 CDT July stood 4-1/4 cents lower at $3.35.</p>
<p>Floor sources noted active bear spreading, partly sparked by continued reports of good harvest progress.</p>
<p>Some inter-market spread trade was also noted and centered on selling MGE spring wheat and buying in both Kansas City and Chicago wheat markets.</p>
