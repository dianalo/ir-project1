<p>The Czech economy, battered and bruised for most of 1997, showed signs of life on Monday, but analysts said it was still too early to pronounce the patient fully on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>The statistical bureau (CSU) on Monday released data showing real industrial output for industrial April rose 6.3 percent, year-on-year.</p>
<p>While output was still down 0.1 percent year-on-year for the first four months of the year, April's figure was a far cry better than March when it contracted 2.5 percent, the third consecutive month it had declined.</p>
<p>The CSU figures also showed that inflation in May continued its downtrend, rising just 0.1 percent, month-on-month, for an all-time low of 6.3 percent, year-on-year.</p>
<p>But analysts warned that even though the data were positive, the effects of emergency measures adopted over the past three weeks by the central bank to support the currency, the crown, and stubbornly high wage growth remain.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation figure for May was very positive,&quot; said Boris Gomez of ING Barings in Prague.</p>
<p>&quot;But we're more interested in what is going to happen in June and July when prices are liberalised and a weaker crown begin to seep through into higher import prices,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The CSU said industrial wages grew year-on-year by a nominal 14.7 percent, well above the central bank's announced threshold for the economy of 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have not seen concrete evidence that the government has been able to put a ceiling on wages,&quot; said one London-based analyst.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and union leader Richard Falbr held talks on a government austerity package aimed at helping kick start the economy and support the ailing crown, but failed to reach agreement on the development of wages.</p>
<p>The positive data could not have come at a better time for Klaus, who's government faces a knife-edge confidence vote in parliament this week which will determine the future of his economic programme.</p>
<p>Klaus's three-party, centre-right coalition controls only 100 seats in the 200-seat lower house and even members of the government have been driving hard bargains for their support in the vote, which could come as early as Tuesday.</p>
<p>Coalition leaders met early on Monday and the full government was scheduled to meet later to hammer out a series of budget cuts that form part of an austerity programme one party wants adopted in exchange for its support.</p>
<p>The crown responded positively to the figures, but dealers cautioned the market would remain very volatile ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling now is that the government will win the confidence vote,&quot; said Tomas Becvar, a dealer Komercni Banka.</p>
<p>&quot;This should help the crown today...The (economic) figures were very good, but we will have to wait probably one more month to see what kind of effect the events of the past month will have,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Speculators, alarmed at widening current account and trade deficits and growing political uncertainty, short-sold the crown, leading the central bank to float the currency in May.</p>
<p>Coalition leaders the next day agreed a sweeping cabinet reshuffle and the austerity programme, which called for budget cuts totalling some 20 billion crowns and wage freezes.</p>
<p>The crown was trading at 32.837 to the dollar and 19.101 against the mark in late trading on Monday, about 60-80 basis points stronger than the central bank's fixing at midday.</p>
