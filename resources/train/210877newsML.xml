<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, rooting for his dearest dream, said he hoped that many of the 15 member nations in Europe will qualify to join the currency union at the end of the decade.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal must be that many nations meet the stability criteria and participate in the currency union from the beginning,&quot; Kohl told a banking forum on Friday.</p>
<p>Kohl, credited as a driving force behind the goal of European political and monetary integration, warned nations faced more work in order to make the union, scheduled to be launched on January 1, 1999, be a lasting success.</p>
<p>&quot;Today it is important to map out the patch for achieving this,&quot; Kohl said, stressing the &quot;criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty must be adhered to, in the long term as well.&quot;</p>
<p>This meant the so-called stability pact, German finance minister Theo Waigel's brainchild establishing automatic sanctions to ensure lasting fiscal austerity, must be adopted.  </p>
<p>&quot;We want a firm currency,&quot; Kohl said, stressing this is another reason to adopt the stability pact.</p>
<p>&quot;European integration is a key for the competitiveness of Europe,&quot; Kohl said, adding, &quot;the heart of the challenge is to advance the construction of our common European house.&quot;</p>
<p>Amid talk that the timeplan for the European currency union should maybe be delayed, Kohl responded &quot;both the stability criteria and the timetable can be reached&quot;.</p>
<p>Kohl also took the opportunity to stress that the German federal government and the Bundesbank were in absolute agreement on all of these issues.</p>
<p>European countries which want to meld their currencies in the planned Euro from 1999 are scrambling to meet economic targets on interest and exchange rates, inflation, budget deficits and public debt in the 1997 year.</p>
<p>Most European countries are facing the greatest problems in meeting the fiscal targets, which call for budget deficits to run at a maximum of three percent of gross domestic product and public debt at a maximum of 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Germany has been adamant throughout that there should be no political fudging when it comes to deciding who has qualified for entry and who has not.</p>
