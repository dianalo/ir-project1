<title>USA: Arkansas water/sewer bill advances in state Senate.</title>
<headline>Arkansas water/sewer bill advances in state Senate.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A bill that would merge Arkansas' water and sewer programs and authorize up to $300 million of combined bonding authority passed out of a key state senate committee Tuesday, a Arkansas official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to Randy Young, executive director of the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission, the bill would authorize the commission to issue up to $300 million of general obligation bonds.</p>
<p>Issuance would be limited to $60 million per fiscal biennium, unless the state's general assembly granted approval.</p>
<p>The soil and water commission currently administers both programs, Young said.</p>
<p>The first is called the Water Resources General Obligation Bond Development program. The second is the Arkansas Waste and Pollution Abatement General Obligation Bond program.</p>
<p>&quot;We proposed last session to merge them so we would have common regulations (and) application procedures,&quot; Young said, adding that occasionally a municipality will want to borrow for both water and waste water purposes. If the senate bill is approved, &quot;we could do it with one financing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The bill passed out of the Senate's Agriculture and Economic Development Committee on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It proceeds to the Senate floor for a vote. If the bill receives approval from both the state Senate and House of Representatives, it will go to Governor Mike Huckabee for signing.</p>
<p>The bill would then go before voters in the 1998 general election, Young said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a House bill authorizing up to $12.025 million of additional bonding authority for the soil and water commission passed the state assembly's joint budget committee last week.</p>
<p>If that bill passes the legislature and is signed by Governor Huckabee, it would clear the way for the commission to issue $15 million in bonds for projects on deck in the current biennium.</p>
<p>Approval for the additional authority is necessary because when voters approved $100 million of water bonding authority back in 1985, the measure limited issuance to $15 million a biennium.</p>
<p>The $12 million is needed to augment the $2 million to $3 million of approved bonding authority remaining for the current biennium, which concludes June 30, Young said. Young added that the commission has already received additional bonding authority for this biennium.</p>
<p>In addition, the House bill would authorize issuance of up to $24.7 million during the next biennium, which runs from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1999. The $24.7 million would finish off the remainder of the 1985 $100 million of authorization, Young said.</p>
