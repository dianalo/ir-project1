<title>DENMARK: U.S. data send Danish share prices down.</title>
<headline>U.S. data send Danish share prices down.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-06-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>A spate of U.S. indicators and local profit-taking sent Danish share prices down on Tuesday, ending a four-day run of record highs.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the market to fall further tomorrow. The American numbers sent US and German bonds down and that spilled over into the stock market,&quot; a Copenhagen dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Danish market has risen sharply over the past week and that has given rise to profit-taking. We expect that to continue over the next few days,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 0.53 point down, at 170.94, in overall bourse turnover of 1.2 billion crowns.  </p>
<p>Its June future fell 0.55, to 171.20, with 1,837 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Movement was spread fairly evenly across the top 20, with seven shares up, eight down and five unchanged.</p>
<p>The largest movment was a three percent rise by chemicals group Superfos, to 166.00 crowns, on technical trading after breaking the 160-crown resistance point on Monday, the dealer said, adding that prices in general were likely to slip as the summer holiday season arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;We are entering a news-starved period,&quot; he said. --Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33969650</p>
