<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss shares fall below 4,500 SMI points.</title>
<headline>Swiss shares fall below 4,500 SMI points.</headline>
<text>
<p>1600 GMT - Swiss shares continued Friday's consolidation, slipping below 4,500 points in the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) on profit taking.</p>
<p>The market picked up near the end of the session after Wall Street moved into positive terrain. Volume was low as insecurity about further developments prevailed. &quot;A brief pause would do the market good,&quot; one dealer said. The longer-term outlook remained good, he added. * The SMI ended off 59.3 points, or 1.13 percent, at 4,463.2. * All-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) fell 34.24 points, or 1.19 percent, to 2,837.0.  </p>
<p>The development of the U.S. dollar, U.S. economic data on Tuesday and Thursday as well as Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress may give the market direction, one trader noted. &quot;The flow of funds may have come to an end until it is clear where we are going,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>* Pharmaceuticals Novartis and Roche, which have been sought in the past few sessions, were hit by profit-taking.</p>
<p>Most-active Novartis bearer shares fell 33 francs to 1,759. Trade in the rights issues for Novartis unit Ciba Specialty Chemicals will start on Wednesday and this could have an impact on Novartis' shares, one trader said.  </p>
<p>* Nestle gave up 15 francs to close at 1,601.</p>
<p>* Among financials, UBS slipped 18 francs to 1,280. Credit Suisse fell 2.50 francs to 152. Insurer Zuerich traded unchanged at 426.50 francs. Insurer Baloise added 15 francs to end at 2,905.</p>
<p>* ABB kept up quite well, slipping three francs to 1,808. The company's 1996 figures are due for release on Thursday.</p>
<p>* Electrowatt slid eight francs to 531 after paying out a dividend of eight francs on its shares.</p>
