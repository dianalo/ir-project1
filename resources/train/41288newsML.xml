<p>Palestinian and Israeli negotiators relaunched talks on implementation of PLO-Israel peace deals on Monday and agreed on procedural issues for future talks, officals said.</p>
<p>President Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled the talks during their first meeting last week.</p>
<p>&quot;We discussed today the main issues which, according to the meeting between the chairman and our prime minister, are a top priority,&quot; Israel's chief negotiator Dan Shomron said.</p>
<p>&quot;We also discussed procedures for solving these problems,&quot; he told reporters in Palestinian-ruled Jericho.</p>
<p>Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian side in the joint steering and monitoring committee, said he had presented to the Israeli side a list of outstanding issues for implementation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have agreed that the civil affairs committee and the economic as well as security committees will start working immediately,&quot; Erekat said. &quot;We have agreed on the modalities and mechanisms for implementation.&quot;</p>
<p>The steering committee talks, held at Erekat's Jericho offices, were the first since Netanyahu ousted the dovish Labour party government which negotiated peace accords with the PLO.</p>
<p>Palestinians have complained that Netanyahu's government is not honouring the agreements -- foremost Israel's commitment to withdraw from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who opposed the Hebron redeployment agreement signed by the previous government, hopes to make alterations to better safeguard around 400 Jewish settlers living in armed compounds amidst 100,000 Palestinians in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>The two sides described the talks as &quot;cordial&quot; but split sharply over the issue of Hebron.</p>
<p>Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour rejected an Israeli spokesman's statement that the sides had reached an understanding that modifications would be made to the Hebron pullout plan agreed upon by the Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not true. The issue was not even brought up in the meeting. We have not agreed to renegotiate any issue in our signed agreements. We have not agreed to any modifications.&quot;</p>
<p>The Israeli government spokesman, Moshe Fogel, later asked to restate the Jewish state's position, told Reuters: &quot;There is an understanding that Israel's request for modifications will be raised at the talks.&quot;</p>
<p>Erekat said the sides discussed Israel's closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip which Palestinians say has devastated the economy of the self-ruled areas and an airport in the PLO-ruled Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Israel clamped a tight closure on the West Bank and Gaza during a wave of Islamic militant suicide bombings which killed 59 in the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Palestinians see the Gaza airport as vital to easing travel and trade currently controlled by Israel. Israel, which has ultimate security control over borders under interim peace deals, says the airport must fall under its security jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Palestinians have also called for Israel to implement further troop redeployments in the West Bank which were scheduled to begin on September 7.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of further redeployments will be discussed at later meetings,&quot; Fogel said.</p>
