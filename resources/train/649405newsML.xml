<p>Embattled Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Tuesday opened a confidence debate by calling on parliament to back his programme for economic revival.</p>
<p>Klaus, who called the debate after the government's popularity slumped over its handling of an economic slowdown, told deputies his aim was to restore faith in the economy and the battered Czech crown currency.</p>
<p>&quot;Our short-term aim is to stabilise the Czech economy and start to decrease the external imbalances and on that basis begin to renew the confidence of our and the foreign public in our economy and our currency,&quot; Klaus said at the start of a debate expected to lead to a knife-edge result.</p>
<p>Most analysts expect Klaus's three-party, centre-right coalition, which controls 100 seats in the 200-seat lower house, to survive.</p>
<p>But if he loses, Klaus, widely credited with masterminding the Czech Republic's post-communist economic transformation, will be forced under the constitution to step down.</p>
<p>His decision to call the debate last week followed two turbulent weeks in the foreign exchange market when investors, alarmed at widening current account and trade gaps and mounting political uncertainty, dumped the crown and eventually forced the central bank to float the currency.</p>
<p>&quot;We should not forget that the Czech Republic was up to now considered an economically and politically stable country and that was a success for us all,&quot; Klaus said.</p>
<p>&quot;We should agree that it is in our national interest to preserve this credit, and never irreparably damage it or lose it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government last week also announced an austerity package, the second in as many months, to help balance the books. Klaus told deputies the government would propose 1997 budget spending cuts of 16.5 billion crowns ($515 million) and changes in the law to slash welfare payments by a further 3.5 billion.</p>
<p>Milos Zeman, leader of the main opposition Social Democrats, said Klaus's government did not deserve trust.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to express my deep conviction that the basic factor of economic instability in the Czech Republic is the current government in its current personnel composition,&quot; Zeman said.</p>
<p>But, in what could be a crucial statement, deputy premier Josef Lux, leader of the centrist Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), said its deputies would support the government.</p>
<p>&quot;The deputies of the KDU-CSL are ready to declare their confidence in this government, in the sense of confidence in its programme declaration, in the announced change in economic policy, and in the sense of confidence in the stabilisation and recovery programme,&quot; Lux said.</p>
<p>Despite his senior government position, Lux has frequently criticised Klaus's style and had demanded adoption of the austerity package and postponement of rent and energy price hikes in exchange for his support.</p>
<p>The government hammered out an agreement on the budget cuts in talks which lasted into the early hours of Tuesday but decided not to postpone the deregulation of rent and energy prices, due to take effect on July 1.</p>
<p>Klaus called the vote partly to spike the guns of Zeman, who had planned to put forward a vote of no confidence at a session of parliament beginning on July 1.</p>
<p>Deputies agreed to extend debate into the evening, but it was not clear if the final vote would be taken on Tuesday.</p>
