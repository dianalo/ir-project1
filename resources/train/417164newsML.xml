<dateline>KINGSTON, Jamaica 1997-03-04</dateline>

<p>Indian paceman Javagal Srinath, whose tour of West Indies has been cut short by a shoulder injury, could return to the Caribbean later, coach Madan Lal said.</p>
<p>Srinath, who has a torn muscle in his right shoulder, flew from Kingston on Monday to South Africa where he is to undergo medical tests.</p>
<p>&quot;If he is fit enough for the final two tests we would be happy to have him back...he is our leading bowler,&quot; said Lal.</p>
<p>A replacement is to join the tour party but the Indian coach said that up to Monday no decision had been taken on who it would be, even suggesting it may not necessarily be a pace bowler. &quot;He could be a spinner,&quot; said Lal.</p>
<p>Srinath has a recent history of shoulder problems and missed the one-off home test against Australia late last year because of the problem.</p>
<p>India's team management said Srinath complained of pain in the shoulder while bowling in the first net session of their tour last Thursday.</p>
<p>The Indians' four-day opening match against Jamaica  at Sabina Park ended in a predictably tame draw on Monday once the touring side had avoided the follow-on.</p>
<p>Resuming the last day at 271 for five in reply to Jamaica's first innings of 453 for nine declared, India were guided to safety by Saurav Ganguly, who finished with an unbeaten 82 in their 323 all out.</p>
<p>Jamaican opener Leon Garrick stroked 108 and test batsman Jimmy Adams scored 53 not out as the island side reached 190 for four in their second innings at the end of the game.</p>
<p>India begin the first of five tests against West Indies in Kingston on Thursday.</p>
