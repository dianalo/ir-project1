<p>The Zimbabwe dollar closed mixed against hard currencies after Wednesday's quiet interbank session during which it's ratings were mainly dictated by overseas market trends, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very quiet (local) market. There were no big payments as such... the Zimbabwe dollar only went down because dealers were quoting high to protect their positions as was the case yesterday (Tuesday),&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The local unit finished the day at 10.8250/8400 against the U.S. dollar, down from Tuesday's 10.8175/8325 but was quoted stronger versus sterling at 18.2980/3369 compared to 18.3248/3557, responding to a firmer U.S. dollar over the British currency overseas.</p>
<p>It also edged up on the mark to 6.8879/8996 from 6.9205/9332 but was steady at 2.3153/3210 against neighbouring South Africa's rand.</p>
