<p>Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi urged parliament on Friday to speed up reforms, saying he feared a political crisis unless it adopted the necessary legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no time to lose. We have already lost enough time,&quot; Lucinschi said in a message to parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;In many respects we lag behind Russia, Romania and Ukraine, the countries we have the biggest economic ties with.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc signed a memorandum with the World Bank last month which stipulated five preliminary steps to be taken by Moldova to unblock reforms and receive a $100 million structural adjustment loan from the World Bank.</p>
<p>The steps were boosting privatisation, agrarian reform including land sales, strengthening the framework for public spending and reducing arrears, reforming the pension system and raising the pensionable age, and privatising the energy sector.</p>
<p>But the conditions were not met and a special World Bank meeting on Moldova, scheduled for June 26, was postponed.</p>
<p>A World Bank mission was due to arrive in the country of 4.3 million on Friday for further talks with the government.</p>
<p>Lucinschi advised deputies to adopt new laws in the next two to three weeks on matters including land sales, bankruptcy, privatisation of the energy complex and reforming the pension system.</p>
<p>&quot;Solution of these problems cannot be delayed. Playing political games around them would be equivalent to an act of sabotage against reforms,&quot; Lucinschi said.</p>
<p>He cautioned that if the laws were not adopted, Moldova would run the risk of relations being severed with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case, Moldova would not be able to benefit from foreign credits amounting to $143 million in the second half of 1997,&quot; Lucinschi said.</p>
<p>He said that would lead to a devaluation of the national currency, price increases and a further decline in living standards. It would deal a blow to Moldova's international image, he said.</p>
<p>The World Bank and the IMF praised Moldova for an initial period of successful stabilisation, but said there had been serious cause for concern since the second half of 1996 because of a slowdown in structural reforms.</p>
<p>Lucinschi, who took office last November, and the government have promised faster reforms. But they are not backed by leftist deputies who are wary of approving unpopular measures before a parliamentary election due early next year.</p>
<p>Lucinschi said that if parliament did not adopt the necessary laws to speed up reforms, the government would not be able to carry out its programme and would request a vote of confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;That would inevitably lead to a government and parliamentary crisis,&quot; Lucinschi said.</p>
<p>&quot;Early parliamentary elections can be viewed as part of the key problem of our ability to push through reforms in the very short term.&quot;</p>
<p>Dumitru Motpan, the chairman of parliament, said the deputies would discuss the president's comments next Wednesday.</p>
