<title>NETHERLANDS: European bunkers steady, demand very low.</title>

<p>Bunker prices across Europe were steady on Monday and levels of enquiry were very low, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST fuel oil was talked at around $89 fob, as it was late on Friday, despite a slight strengthening of the barge market.</p>
<p>Dealers said barges firmed as one trading house had problems delivering fuel oil and would only supply at the end of 48 hour nomination periods. Barge sellers held out at higher levels in the hope that some bunker suppliers would be unable to wait that long for their oil.</p>
<p>Total ARA volumes were little more than 10,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were stable at around $90/$91 fob.</p>
<p>Mediterranean prices were also broadly stable and demand poor. A public holiday in Greece also limited trading.</p>
<p>The exception was southern France where shortages at the end of last week eased and prices dipped.</p>
<p>Fujairah bunkers edged up with the strength of benchmark cargo prices.</p>
