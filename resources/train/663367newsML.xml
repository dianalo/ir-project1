<p>A senior Chinese official said Britain had once considered turning Hong Kong into an independent state to prevent Beijing from retaking the colony, a Taipei-based newspaper said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Britain) had discussed how to not return Hong Kong to China, and one way was to hold a plebiscite to turn Hong Kong into a Singapore,&quot; Zhou Nan, the Hong Kong director of China's official Xinhua news agency, told Taiwan's China Times daily.</p>
<p>Singapore won full independence and became a republic in 1965.</p>
<p>Zhou, who attended Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong handover issue between 1982 and 1984, did not elaborate on his remarks.</p>
<p>His comments marked the first time a senior Chinese official had confirmed widespread speculation by Hong Kong newspapers that Beijing had suspected a Britain-engineered separatist plot for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Zhou said Britain was unwilling to hand Hong Kong back to China, and had tried to nullify the previously signed retrocession pact during its negotiations with Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;British negotiators told (late paramount leader) Deng Xiaoping that a disastrous consequence would occur if Britain did not administer Hong Kong, but Comrade Deng did not buy into this,&quot; Zhou told the newspaper.</p>
<p>China is set to regain sovereignty over Hong Kong at midnight on June 30, ending 156 years of British rule.</p>
<p>&quot;When the sovereignty issue is involved, China would never compromise,&quot; Zhou said.</p>
<p>Xinhua is China's highest representative office in Hong Kong.</p>
