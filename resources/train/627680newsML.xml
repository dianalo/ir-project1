<p>The Belgian government is inviting telecoms operators to enter bids for a third GSM mobile telephone network in Belgium, the government said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Within a year from now the government wants to select the operator with a view to have an operational third network within two years,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said after the weekly cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Di Rupo also said the government was inviting bids for a digital semaphone network which would be run by three operators. Users should be contactable around Europe.</p>
<p>The current network is analogue.</p>
<p>Mobistar NV launched Belgium's second GSM network last August. Mobistar is 57 percent owned by France Telecom. Belgian data communications company Telinfo holds 10 percent and nine other Belgian companies the balance.</p>
<p>Belgium's first mobile service Proximus is run by Belgacom Mobile, 75-percent owned by Belgian state telephone operator Belgacom and 25-percent by AirTouch Communications Inc.</p>
<p>Belgium has more than half a million GSM users, with Mobistar accounting for about a fifth.</p>
<p>Mobistar has more than 120,000 customers. It expects to add at least another 100,000 clients by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Mobistar said last month it would stay deep in the red in 1997 but reach break-even by the turn of the century. It had a 1996 loss of 4.19 billion francs ($118 million) which was in line with expectations and caused by start-up costs.</p>
