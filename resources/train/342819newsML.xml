<p>The former communist states of Central Europe will not become full members of the European Union until the middle of the next decade at the earliest, JP Morgan's economic unit said in a research note.</p>
<p>&quot;Even assuming CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Association) maintains its enthusiasm and presses on with economic reforms, a conservative estimate for completion of the membership process would be halfway through the next decade,&quot; the note said.</p>
<p>French and German politicians have repeatedly named 2000 as the year when CEFTA members -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia -- could join the EU, a deadline that was reaffirmed by French President Jacques Chirac on a visit to Budapest earlier this month.</p>
<p>Also earlier this month, the European Commission said in a policy paper that EU expansion should not happen before 2002, but then said the paper does not reflect official policy.</p>
<p>But JP Morgan said these deadlines cannot be met.</p>
<p>Accession talks are not supposed to begin until mid-1998, a half a year after the EU's current inter-governmental conference ends, and they will take at least three years, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;This assumes that no major complications arise from the linked discussions,&quot; the note said.</p>
<p>After at least three years of negotiations, EU's current members as well as the applicants would have to ratify the documents the negotiators draft, which would cause further delays, JP Morgan added.</p>
<p>Other analysts have suggested that there was plenty of scope for complications during the negotiations, including the EU's agricultural policy and the cohesion funds, which are transferred, in essence, from wealthier states to poorer ones.</p>
<p>It was thought that the relatively poor and agricultural ex-communist states would unbalance the farm policies and would deplete the cohesion funds unless the programmes are reformed.</p>
<p>JP Morgan's report said that for its own part, the EU was trying to prepare itself for expansion by discussing farm policy and cohesion funds during the inter-governmental conference.</p>
<p>Overall, however, Central European states are essentially doing what is necessary to ensure that they are ready for EU membership, although some work remains to be done on social security and labour reform and financial regulations, it added.</p>
<p>The analysis also said that fears Slovakia would not be among the first ex-communist countries admitted to EU are overplayed as the country is a &quot;parliamentary republic with a government subject to free elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's government has been repeatedly criticised by Western leaders for its heavy-handed treatment of the media and ethnic minorities.</p>
