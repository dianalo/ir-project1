<p>Bilbek airport at Ukraine's Black Sea city of Sevastopol will be upgraded to an international one starting with regular flights to Moscow, Ukrinform Business News weekly bulletin said on Monday.</p>
<p>It quoted Vladimir Perekalsky, head of Sevastopol's Bilbek airport, as saying flights to Moscow would be launched with a stopover in Ukraine's central industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk.</p>
<p>The report did not say when the flights would be launched or which other international destinations could be served and airport officials could not immediately be contacted.</p>
<p>Bilbek, which served for decades as a military airbase for the Black Sea fleet in Soviet days, launched charter flights to Kiev two years ago when Ukrainian authorities opened Sevastopol for domestic visitors and foreigners.</p>
<p>Last year 186 Kiev-Sevastopol flights were made by Air Ukraine and Krym (Crimea) air companies. This month flights to the Ukrainian cities of Lviv, Poltava and Donetsk are due to be launched.</p>
<p>Perekalsky was quoted as saying Bilbek airport was considering proposals from investors to modernise its passenger terminal, customs and border offices for $300,000.</p>
<p>The next step, he added, would be to build a proper passenger terminal with a hotel and restaurants at a cost of $18.5 million -- though sources of cash had been identified yet.</p>
<p>Bilbek has 3,600 square metres of cargo storage and aviation experts say it could be used as a major cargo transit point on the Crimean peninsula, which attracts millions of tourists.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the Ukrainian government ordered a reduction in the number of airports serving international routes due to the cost of customs and passport control services.</p>
<p>Of Ukraine's 37 airports, 17 serve international routes.</p>
