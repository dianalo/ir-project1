<title>USA: Brazil Bradys slip on Supreme Court pay rise vote.</title>
<headline>Brazil Bradys slip on Supreme Court pay rise vote.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazilian Brady bond prices fell sharply after news that the country's Supreme Court voted in favor of a 28.9 percent pay rise for 11 civil servants, said emerging market debt experts.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has reacted to the vote in the Supreme Court of Brazil regarding back wages for state employees and so Brazil is selling off on that,&quot; said one emerging market debt trader at a major U.S. firm.</p>
<p>At 1610 EST/2110 GMT, Brazilian &quot;C&quot; bonds  were one percentage point lower at 80-3/4 bid and the country's par bonds  were 1/2 weaker at 67-3/4 bid.  </p>
<p>Market experts said the wage ruling, along with a local newspaper report Tuesday that Brazil's foreign trade deficit had accumulated to $1.2 billion in the first two weeks of February, was seen as a major negative for the market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's definitely bad news coming as it does on the heels of estimates being leaked that the foreign trade deficit of Brazil is coming in very large in the month of February,&quot; said Arturo Porzecanski, chief economist for emerging markets at ING Barings in New York.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think that confidence on the part of investors in Brazil and foreign investors in Brazil is as we speak being battered,&quot; Porzecanski added.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Brazil's Finance Ministry said in Brasilia that the Ministry was concerned about the favorable ruling by the Supreme Court because it could set a precedent for the whole federal workforce.</p>
<p>He said the ministry did not know what the financial impact would be and would start evaluating the potential cost now.  </p>
<p>However, he noted that the 28.9 percent wage rise for the 11 servents was &quot;nothing&quot; and that the decision only assumed importance if extended to the rest of the federal payroll.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a presidential spokesman told reporters in Brasilia that the government would not allow the wage claim to put the country's economic stability at risk.</p>
<p>In the broader Latin Brady market, traders said spreads widened as market participants took profits on gains scored in recent weeks.  </p>
<p>&quot;Spreads have widened about four basis points in Argentina on profit taking and consolidation,&quot; said another trader a major Wall Street firm.</p>
<p>Argentine FRBs  were 1/2 lower at 90-7/8 and Venezuelan DCBs  were 5/8 weaker at 89-7/8 bid.</p>
<p>Among Eastern European Bradys, traders said Bulgarian instruments continued to rise amid growing positive investor sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;Bulgaria is a bit stronger on some short-covering,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Bulgaria FLRBs  were 1/2 higher at 46 bid and its discount bonds  were 1/2 better at 62-1/2.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Russain Vnesh dollar loans were 1/4 weaker at 84-1/4 bid.</p>
