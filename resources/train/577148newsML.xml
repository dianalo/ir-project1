<p>Oil prices rallied on Monday to levels not seen for nearly two months, ignoring bearish long term trends to soar on the back of institutional buying, supply problems and tension in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Benchmark Brent crude oil futures for June delivery climbed more than 65 cents to trade at $19.55 just before 1500 gmt, breaking through psychological price barriers to hit levels not seen since mid-March.</p>
<p>The rise, which showed no signs of abating, continued last week's 80-cent gains.</p>
<p>North American benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, was also muscling its way through barriers, with June paper gaining some 80 cents in its first hour of business to hit $21.20 by mid-afternoon European time.</p>
<p>Crude's strength has taken some oil traders by surprise, with no single factor accounting for its rise.</p>
<p>Much of the market enthusiasm came from institutional investors who hurried back into oil derivatives on Monday, encouraged by last week's price pick-up, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a huge amount of fund-buying today,&quot; said one dealer at a leading U.S. bank.</p>
<p>Iranian wargames which began on Sunday in the Gulf, home to the majority of the world's oil supply, and a U.S. pledge to defend the strategic Straits of Hormuz, was also making the Middle East jittery, brokers said.</p>
<p>But others described the regional problem as perennial and gave it no major significance.</p>
<p>More worrying for others in the European market was the prospect of substantial shortfalls in June deliveries of North Sea Brent crude.</p>
<p>Maintenance will claim 21 to 27 standard 500,000 barrel cargoes from the Brent loading programme in June, around a tenth of average monthly production, traders said.</p>
<p>Crude oil deliveries were further threatened on Monday by a blockade of the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands by a flotilla of shell fishing boats protesting at lack of compensation for damage from the Braer oil spill in 1993.</p>
<p>No tankers were scheduled to load at the terminal, which handles Brent blend liftings -- one-fifth of Britain's total output -- until Tuesday, and traders said it was too early to judge the effect of the fishermen's action.</p>
<p>Crude's vigour amazed some analysts, who stuck to their belief that price's would slump back below $18, when the reality of galloping production and stagnating demand once more dawns on the oil markets.</p>
<p>As recently as last Friday the Paris-based International Energy Agency forecast an increase in global supply in the second quarter of 1997 as OPEC members bust production quotas and non-OPEC players produce at full tilt.</p>
<p>On top of the lowest fall in OECD industry stocks for any winter since 1990, further production growth was likely to tip prices lower, the IEA said in its latest monthly market report.</p>
