<p>Hong Kong police, barristers and judges are scrambling to define what law and order mean now the territory is under new management.</p>
<p>British colonial rule ended at midnight on June 30 when Hong Kong reverted to China.</p>
<p>Although the territory's unique way of life is guaranteed for 50 years under a treaty between London and Beijing, certain institutions, laws and customs no longer prevail.</p>
<p>Sorting out what the changes mean practically could be a long process as Hong Kong's post-handover legal and political systems strive for an accommodation.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, long known as a bastion of civil liberties in Asia, now has a new Public Order Ordinance which allows police to ban public processions deemed to threaten national security.</p>
<p>Human and political rights activists fear freedom of speech and assembly could be seriously curtailed.</p>
<p>Police chief Eddie Hui on Thursday directed that national security -- defined as &quot;safeguarding the territorial integrity and the independence of the People's Republic of China&quot; -- could not be invoked by anyone below his Director of Operations.</p>
<p>Jean Chan, a police spokeswoman, went further on Friday by stating that &quot;my understanding is that the issue of national security is not for us (the police) to decide&quot;.</p>
<p>Left unclear is who will determine when China's national security is threatened, and on what basis.</p>
<p>It could be Hong Kong's new Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa, or the Provisional Legislature which revised the Public Order Ordinance.</p>
<p>Appointed by Beijing to replace Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council, the Provisional Legislature's legal authority to pass laws is itself questioned by leading barristers.</p>
<p>Even proper terms of address were in doubt in Hong Kong courts on Thursday when one judge acknowledged not knowing whether he should still be spoken to as &quot;Your Lordship&quot; -- a title not much in favour in communist-ruled China.</p>
<p>Reports that Hong Kong police were liaising with Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops garrisoned in the territory caused a frisson of excitement, too, among some who fear the soldiers might be used to quell civil disorder.</p>
<p>But the police said on Friday there was still no formal contact between the PLA, who replaced British troops at midnight on June 30 and the Hong Kong police.</p>
<p>&quot;There won't be any problem contacting the PLA should the need arise but the liaison is yet to be set up,&quot; said spokeswoman Chan. &quot;We are talking to them but we haven't formalised any sort of arrangement yet.&quot;</p>
