<headline>LIFFE coffee futures driven by new fund buying.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE coffee futures gathered some upward momentum on the back of renewed fund buying on Monday but prices ended below the day's peaks.</p>
<p>Traders said that despite the slight pullback, the closing levels were still encouraging. Some also said fund buying, the driving factor behind recent sharp rally, could continue.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't a bad close...it looks very good still,&quot; said one. Origin sellers continued to step back while roasters remained reluctant buyers.</p>
<p>By the finish, March stood $35 higher at $1,535 a tonne after failing to break above $1,553.</p>
<p>The New York market also gained from a new wave of fund demand but traders said the March contract failed to break solid resistance at 145.25 cents a lb.</p>
<p>However, the market's recent upswing remained intact.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, today's advance came despite what many traders termed a bearish CFTC Commitment of Traders report which showed a net increase in speculative (non-commercial and non-reportable) long positions.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, traders said the London market was supported by trade shortcovering on news that Indonesia would slice first half 1997 exports by 150,000 60-kg bags as part of a producer pact to limit robusta supplies and lift prices.</p>
<p>The market's volume reached a modest 4,085 lots, dominated by switch trades in March and May which changed hands at level money at one stage.</p>
<p>An Indonesian industry official said at the start of a three-day International Coffee Organisation executive board meeting that the Indonesian decision was final.</p>
<p>&quot;The remaining 850,000 bags will have to be allocated among African and other robusta producers,&quot; the official said. Under the agreement reached in Brazil two weeks ago, robusta exports would have to be cut by a further 1.0 million bags and arabica by 300,000.</p>
<p>Robusta producers are expected to meet on Thursday in Bali, Indonesia, following the ICO meeting to decide on quota allocation. But by Monday, the meeting was yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>In other developments, major Dutch roaster Douwe Egberts said it would be raising its retail prices in response to the sharp rise in world prices.</p>
<p>The move by Douwe Egberts came in the wake of a similar price hike by German roaster Eduscho late last month.</p>
