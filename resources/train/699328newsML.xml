<p>	  blistering three percent rally</p>

<p>**  India United Front minority coalition unlikely to decide</p>

<p>Bombay blue chips showed a smart rise on Monday taking a cue from yesterday's three percent rally as follow-up buying drove prices higher, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is awash with liquidity,&quot; K.R. Bharat, country head at Credit Suisse First Boston told Reuters. &quot;There is so much money going into the system.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier in the day stocks were bruised on an early bout of profit-taking, but managed to rally higher towards close.</p>
<p>Bombay's top 30-share index jumped 45.64 points, or 1.07 percent, to end at a provisional 4,301.73, hitting a 20-month high and adding to Monday's blistering three percent rally.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is facing some resistance near the 4,300 level. It has come back from here, testing these levels a few times,&quot; said Neeraj Roy, head of institutional sales at Prime Securities.</p>
<p>Market action continued to be focussed on cement, financial institutions and multinational stocks, but the gains paled in comparision to the previous day's gains, traders said.</p>
<p>A sizzling 38 percent rally in the first half of 1997, largely led by foreign fund buying on attractive valuations, has made Indian stock exchanges the best performing Asian market this year, analysts said.</p>
