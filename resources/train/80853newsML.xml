<p>Spot wholesale electricity prices in the midsection of the eastern seaboard were flat to lower Friday compared with Thursday's values amid forecasts of mild autumn weather through next week, market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a little higher running rates today for a few hours, but that disappeared quickly,&quot; said one region trader, referring to slightly greater power output briefly today.</p>
<p>A number of coal-fired generating stations in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect power pool, which were shut last weekend for short-term repairs, returned to service this week.</p>
<p>The steady increase in production capacity, combined with moderate power demand, pressured daily PJM cash prices lower.</p>
<p>Firm electricity prices for heavy load hours on Saturday in PJM were quoted at $18.25-$18.75; Sunday $17.50-$18.00; and Monday $19.25-$20.25.</p>
<p>Thursday's PJM peak electricity for Friday was quoted at $19.25-$20.25 and for the weekend $18.00-$19.00.</p>
<p>Weekend PJM electricity for light load hours was discussed at $13.25-$13.50.</p>
<p>PJM power for the balance of September was assessed at $20.00-$21.00, a wider range than Thursday's $20.00-$20.50.</p>
<p>Peak, firm PJM electricity for October was pegged at $20.15-$20.30, slightly lower than a quote of $20.25-$20.40 on Thursday.</p>
<p>November PJM was quoted at $21.50-$21.80, flat from Thursday's range. December PJM was valued at $25.30-$25.60, weaker than Thursday's $25.50-$25.75 range.</p>
<p>PJM electricity delivery in 1996 fourth quarter was quoted at $22.30-$22.50, unchanged from Thursday's quote.</p>
<p>PJM prices in 1997 continued to firm amid rising interest for winter-related power demand, market sources said.</p>
<p>January/February 1997 PJM electricity was valued at $29.50-$29.70, up from Thursday's $29.25-$29.50 assessement.</p>
<p>First-quarter 1997 PJM delivery power was discussed at $27.60-$27.80, a tighter range than Thursday's $27.60-$27.80.</p>
<p>Second-quarter 1997 PJM power was pegged at $21.50-$22.00, flat from Thursday.</p>
