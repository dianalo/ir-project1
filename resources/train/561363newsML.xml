<p>A shakeout in South Korea's car industry, the world's fifth largest, looks inevitable as unchecked expansion by domestic car makers leads to oversupply, analysts said.</p>
<p>The capacity of South Korea's three leading automakers -- Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and Daewoo Motor -- is set to top six million units annually by 2000, up from the current four million.</p>
<p>On top of that, Ssangyong Motor and newcomer Samsung Motors are scheduled to squeeze into the already crowded passenger car market.</p>
<p>&quot;All of them cannot survive. There will be a big shakeout in two or three years,&quot; said Nam Seung-soo, an analyst at Daishin Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>Domestic sales stood at 1.64 million in 1996 and are not expected to increase much this year as the slowing economy slashes spending on durable goods.</p>
<p>But Ssangyong, the Korean partner of Mercedes-Benz, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, would begin producing luxury sedans in October with an annual capacity of 50,000 units.  </p>
<p>The company, a specialised maker of four wheel-drive utility vehicles, wants to make 200,000 passenger cars in 2000.</p>
<p>Samsung entered into a technical tie-up with Japan's Nissan Motor in 1994 and its first cars -- modified versions of Nissan's Maxima sedans -- are expected to go on sale from March 1998.</p>
<p>Samsung aims to sell 80,000 cars in the first year and hopes to raise production to 500,000 by 2002 and one million by 2010.</p>
<p>&quot;The timing of Ssanyong's expansion and Samsung's entry could not be worse. They will add to oversupply,&quot; said Yang Dong-ki, an analyst at Dongbang Peregrine Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;They seem to have some fantasy about the car industry,&quot; said Chang Choon-rin, analyst at Daewoo Research Institute.</p>
<p>He said the domestic vehicle market had reached saturation and car makers were too optimistic about overseas sales.</p>
<p>Car producers say they will look more to exports to overcome excessive capacity and slowing sales at home.</p>
<p>But critics said it would not be easy for South Korean companies to make models attractive to foreign customers.</p>
<p>Flaws in Hyundai's Excel compact sedans exported to the United States in the late 1980s badly damaged the reputation of Korean cars.  </p>
<p>South Korea's car exports to the United States dropped to 201,470 units in 1996 from a peak of 481,100 in 1988, while total exports rose to 1.2 million units from 576,134, according to the Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association.</p>
<p>&quot;Falling sales figures in the U.S., the most sophisticaed market, showed the status of Korean makers, known for low-priced and mediocre-quality cars,&quot; said Hur Kang, an analyst at Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>South Korean producers, now suffering from rising inventories, introduced a slew of incentives in April, including non-interest instalment payment schemes, to jack up sales.</p>
<p>Analysts said car makers cut export prices by about five percent in addition to offering higher margins to overseas dealers.</p>
<p>&quot;These schemes helped push up sales but must have hurt profitability,&quot; said Sohn Jong-won, an analyst at Ssangyong Investment and Securities.</p>
