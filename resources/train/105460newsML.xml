<p>Republican Sen. Jesse Helms this week was stepping up his campaign to keep the seat he has held for 24 years, telling voters Democrat Harvey Gantt would use welfare reform as an excuse to raise their taxes.</p>
<p>The 74-year-old chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee takes a swipe at his opponent's stance on welfare reform in his latest television ad to North Carolina voters.</p>
<p>But Raymond Camp, who teaches political campaign communications at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, said Helms was taking Gantt's comments out of context. He said the line of attack in the ad was typical of the senator's style of becoming more negative as election day approached.</p>
<p>Gannt's campaign hit back Wednesday, saying there was no truth in the accusations made by the Helms campaign.</p>
<p>In the ad an announcer says, &quot;Harvey Gantt now claims he supports welfare reform but the record shows Harvey Gantt opposed block grants to return control to the states. And Harvey Gantt opposes a welfare cap that would stop payments to mothers who have more children while on welfare. So what kind of welfare reform do you support Harvey?&quot;</p>
<p>Then the video shows Gantt in a public forum saying: &quot;I think that in order to do good welfare reform we may have to initially spend a little bit more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing true in that ad is that Harvey Gantt supports welfare reform,&quot; campaign press secretary Lisa Mortman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Camp said Helms was again showing his advertising colours. &quot;Those colours almost always begin with red, white and blue patriotism,&quot; he said. &quot;They end up gray, black and purple -- they get to be more biting, sarcastic and negative the closer we get to the end of the campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>Camp charged the ad was another example of Helms taking things out of context and cited previous Helms ads such as a recent one claiming Gantt supports same-sex marriages.</p>
<p>&quot;Gantt has never held statewide or federal office and to try to extract bits and pieces of Gantt's record from what we know about Gantt is exceptionally picayune,&quot; Camp said.</p>
<p>Gantt, 53, has talked about the need to move people from dependency to self sufficiency. &quot;He has said that the notion of hard work needs to mean something in society again, and that's why he supports time limits for people receiving federal assistance,&quot; Mortman said.</p>
<p>Aides for Helms, the conservative icon who voted for welfare reform, did not return calls. The welfare ad recalls tactics used by the Helms campaign in his 1990 run for the seat -- also against Gantt, an architect and two-time mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, who is black.</p>
<p>Then the lightning rod was the emotional subjects of racial quotas and affirmative action, including a now infamous television ad that showed white hands crumpling a rejection letter for a job an announcer said was lost to a minority. It suggested Gantt favoured race-based quotas, which Gantt denied.</p>
<p>Helms won that race by a 53 percent to 47 percent margin.</p>
<p>Gantt has run ads calling for &quot;old-fashioned values and new ideas&quot; and charged that Helms is too busy to speak for the needs of North Carolina voters.</p>
<p>Political analysts say Gantt cannot afford to ignore the Helms ads this time but are unsure of the right response.</p>
<p>&quot;He might run vigorous denial ads but there's a tremendous amount of risk to them. The more he denies the more voters may sense Helms had a case,&quot; said John Brehm, a political science professor at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.</p>
<p>&quot;Denial ads are probably less (risky) than running counter negative ads, but it's a risk no matter what,&quot; Brehm said.</p>
