<p>China's Tibet Lhasa Brewery Co Ltd said on Thursday it would use proceeds from its forthcoming domestic currency A share offer to expand production and market share in the remote Himalayan region.</p>
<p>The company would raise 79.1 million yuan in net proceeds from an initial public offering (IPO) of 25 million A shares for listing on the Shenzhen stock exchange, the firm said in a prospectus published in Shenzhen's Securities Times.</p>
<p>Beijing Securities Co was the chief underwriter for the IPO, to be priced at 3.38 yuan per share, the prospectus said. The offer would be launched on June 9 and completed by June 15.</p>
<p>Most of the share proceeds would be used to expand the firm's production capacity to 50,000 tonnes of beer a year in 1-1/2 years from the current 35,000 tonnes, it said.</p>
<p>The rest of the money would be used to build a production line for beer cans to replace the bottles that were easily broken after becoming brittle in the freezing temperatures that often hit the lofty Tibetan plateau, it said.</p>
<p>As the Himalayan region's only brewery, the company expected to boost its beer market share in Tibet to 50 percent from 30 percent, helped by increasing demand, it said.</p>
<p>The company posted a net profit of 15.2 million yuan for 1996 and 2.93 million yuan for 1995.</p>
<p>Despite a surge in earnings, the firm's profits were capped by an invasion of beers made outside Tibet and by poor road conditions in the largely undeveloped region that made long-distance delivery difficult, the company said.</p>
<p>After the issue, Tibet Lhasa Brewery will have 66 million shares outstanding, comprised of 41 million shares held by state institutions and 25 million A shares.</p>
