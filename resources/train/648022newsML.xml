<headline>INSIGHT - Dutch chartists bullish on AEX outlook.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-06-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch chartists were bullish on the long-term outlook for the AEX stock market index on Monday, with some advising investors to buy on dips.</p>
<p>The AEX index closed last week at its third consecutive record high, finishing at 824.43 on Friday.</p>
<p>It built on its gains early in Monday's session, registering a new all-time intraday high of 834.43 points.</p>
<p>While MeesPierson sounded a note of caution with a neutral short-term outlook, it counselled investors to use every dip in the market to boost their equity exposure.</p>

<p>Note - Contributors' own analysis follows.</p>
<p>ING Barings -- The AEX is poised to test the upper side of its 9-week rising trend around 840 this week. At the lower reaches of the uptrend there should be good support around 815. The majority of the trend quality indicators of the AEX still favour a bullish scenario.</p>
<p>Rising 9-day moving average looks strong and supports current bullish technicals. The Advance/Decline line continue to set new all-time highs, indicating strong leadership in the market still intact.</p>
<p>The 12-day average of the call/put ratio is still at low levels, suggesting that the majority of market participants are underweighted in the present rally. Last week about 70 stocks reached new 12-month highs, while only three made new 12-month lows.</p>
<p>The only neutral factors in the technical picture of the AEX are the flat money flow line and lagging momentum.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO - This is a LONG market. The negative divergence on RSI has vanished. Volume is supporting the uptrend and downside risk is limited.</p>
<p>We focus on 850 as a first resistance level, where prices can consolidate. But if you take into account our new target for the S&amp;P500 (...another 100 points!), it's easy to see that -- from an intermarket perspective -- 850 will not be the end of the uptrend.</p>
<p>MeesPierson - Our pessimistic view mentioned last week has been punished by the surprisingly strong markets in Europe.</p>
<p>Once again indicators proved to be unreliable in strong trending markets.</p>
<p>Despite our neutral point of view we think that for the short term investors should use every dip on the stock exchange to expand their equity exposure.</p>
