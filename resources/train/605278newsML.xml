<p>Six people, including an unidentified foreigner, were killed on Thursday when an Indonesian-made propeller aircraft crashed in West Java during a test flight, rescue officials said.</p>
<p>An official said the CN-235 plane, carrying three crew and three passengers, crashed at an airport in the coastal town of Serang, 75 km (46 miles) west of Jakarta, where it was coming in to land.</p>
<p>The plane took off from Jakarta's Sukarno-Hatta airport.</p>
<p>&quot;The plane crashed at 13.28 p.m. and burned. We believe the plane experienced a stall before it crashed,&quot; the official told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>He said officials from the aircraft's manufacturers, Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN), were investigating.</p>
<p>The official said he did not have any information about the foreigner killed in the crash, and added that the bodies of the victims had been flown to the provincial capital of Bandung.</p>
<p>IPTN officials were not available for comment.</p>
