<p>Bangladesh bought 25,000 tonnes of white sugar at US$339.70 per tonne on Tuesday for September shipment, Hong Kong trade sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that was the best price on offer,&quot; said one sugar trader.</p>
<p>Bidding for Bangladesh state-owned Sugar and Food Industries Corp's 25,000-tonne sugar tender took place on July 20th.</p>
<p>Otherwise, physical markets in Asia were quiet, with little activity seen as destinations faded away.</p>
<p>&quot;I havn't seen Thais traded in a week,&quot; said another source. The market was attempting to assess how badly hit Thailand's sugar crop would be and trying to plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Estimates ranged from a 15-to-20 percent drop, Hong Kong sources said.</p>
<p>Dry weather was creating havoc in Thailand on top of the country's worst economic slump.</p>
<p>The sugar market had been largely dominated by futures and speculator buying while Asia's physical markets lay low, traders said.</p>
<p>New York's Coffee Sugar and Cocao Exchanges' world sugar futures climbed on fund buying with the benchmark October contract ending on Tuesday 0.33 cents higher at 11.59 cents a lb.</p>
<p>Thai raw sugar premiums were quoted slightly lower from Friday, with July/September deliveries quoted at 0.85/0.95 cent a pound over New York's Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange futures on an FOB basis, sources said.</p>
<p>On Friday, Thai raw sugar premiums for July/September deliveries were quoted at around 90/100 points.</p>
<p>In China, white sugar prices ex-factory in the southern producing province of Guangdong had edged back up to 4,000 yuan per tonne this week, sources said.</p>
<p>Traders said they were bullish over next year's sugar buying in Asia, with a reduced Thai sugar crop, and Indonesia expected to match this year's sugar buying at between 700,000 and one million tonnes.</p>
<p>China remained a question mark, with some traders convinced China would enter the market in 1998 and other sceptical.</p>
<p>China's sugar output totalled 4.65 million tonnes in the first half of this year, up 12.6 percent compared with the year-ago period, the State Statistical Bureau said on Tuesday.</p>
