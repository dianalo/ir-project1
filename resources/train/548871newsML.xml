<p>Shanghai Yaohua Pilkington Glass Co Ltd said on Tuesday that good management kept the company profitable in 1996 despite fierce competition in the glass industry.</p>
<p>The company said in its annual report that 1996 net profit slid to 80.39 million yuan from 189.76 million yuan in 1995, under international accounting standards.</p>
<p>Under domestic accounting standards, the net was 113.56 million yuan against 263.193 million yuan, the report, published in the Shanghai Securities News, said.</p>
<p>Earnings per share dropped to 0.23 yuan in 1996 against 0.67 yuan in 1995, based on domestic accounting standards, it said.</p>
<p>Despite the sharp fall, the 1996 net profit was not easy to attain because of intensifying competition, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prompted by high returns, China's glass production had grown too fast in the previous two years, causing prices to plunge nationwide in 1996,&quot; the annual report said. &quot;In addition, demand on the international market also fell in 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>The firm said its key task in 1996 was to maintain market share and keep its production line running at high capacity.</p>
<p>As a result, 1996 turnover was 589.535 million yuan against 646.435 million yuan in 1995, falling much less than profits.  </p>
<p>&quot;The firm also worked hard to develop its glass processing technology,&quot; the annual report said.</p>
<p>The company's board of directors proposed a cash dividend of 0.15 yuan per share based on the 1996 net, pending shareholder approval at a meeting scheduled for May 30, the report said.</p>
