<p>Greece's socialist government, mixing experienced ministers with younger reformers, will face tough challenges on the economy and foreign policy after being sworn in on Wednesday by President Costis Stephanopoulos.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who scored a solid election win on Sunday, handpicked his cabinet, rejecting efforts by some ministers to bargain over positions.</p>
<p>Simitis, 60, disappointed some by shying from the radical cabinet changes he once hinted at. He opted instead to keep on old-guard socialists and mix them with young reformers who helped put him in power.</p>
<p>A dry technocrat who trained in Germany and Britain as an economist, he took over from late party founder and three-time prime minister Andreas Papandreou in January.</p>
<p>His gamble to call an early election paid off and set his seal of authority on the socialist party and the government.</p>
<p>The cabinet, where the only major change was the removal of Gerassimos Arsenis from the defence ministry, sent a message of stability and continuity to markets.</p>
<p>The cabinet, to be sworn in at 0800 GMT by Stephanopoulos, includes just one new face as a full minister and mostly moves members of the old Papandreou guard.</p>
<p>Simitis gave the defence ministry to Akis Tsohatzopoulos, his opponent in the tough leadership battles that followed the death of Papandreou in June.</p>
<p>He kept his economic team intact, keeping Development Minister Vasso Papandreou and giving National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou the finance ministry as well.</p>
<p>The most radicial reform was to send former finance minister Alexandros Papadopoulos to the interior ministry where he will try to bring public sector administration under control. He has already vowed to hire only one person for every three who leave.</p>
<p>Simitis renamed Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who has won respect for his skills but raised eyebrows for occasional blunt criticism of some EU partners.</p>
<p>Pangalos's major challenge will be over relations with Turkey and efforts by the United States to lessen tensions between the two NATO states in the Aegean and over Cyprus.</p>
<p>Washington sent a message to Greece on Tuesday, saying it hoped to lead a new effort to resolve Greek-Turkish tensions.</p>
<p>The State Department said U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher passed the message to Pangalos at a meeting in New York, where both are attending the U.N. General Assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;Secretary Christopher said he thought that it was important for the United States to help lead a new effort to resolve some of the Aegean problems between Greece and Turkey,&quot; a state department official said.</p>
<p>Greece has refused to negotiate with Ankara over a variety of disputes, saying the right place to settle such matters was the International Court of Justice in the Hague.</p>
