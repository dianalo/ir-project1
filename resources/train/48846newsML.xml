<p>-------------------------------------------------------------- * Toronto stocks rallied to a strong finish, led by strong bank shares * TSE also helped by bonds following release of subdued inflation data * 98.7 million shares traded  </p>
<p>Toronto stocks rallied to a strong finish on Thursday, led by soaring bank stocks and a subdued U.S. inflation picture.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Index rose 31.20 points to close at 5191.60 in heavy turnover of 98.7 million shares valued at C$1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Advancing stocks outpaced declines 504 to 405 with 306 issues ending flat. Canadian bonds strengthened along with U.S. treasuries on tame U.S. producer price data.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the best of both worlds. Economic growth but with no inflationary pressures,&quot; said Jim Doak, senior vice-presiden of investment research at ScotiaMcLeod Inc.  </p>
<p>The overall producer price index (PPI) rose 0.3 percent in August, but the core numbers slipped 0.1 percent. The core data excludes volatile food and energy items.</p>
<p>Analysts said the PPI numbers and sagging gold prices are bearish for inflation and suggest U.S. interest rates may not move higher in the short term.</p>
<p>On the TSE, all but one of Toronto's 14 sub-indices finished higher, led by the banks, consumer products, utilities and energy.</p>
<p>The lone weak sector was metals and minerals.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Bank stocks dominated the most-active list. Royal Bank of Canada jumped 1.05 to close at 36.20 on 2.1 million shares. The stock hit a new high of 36.25 after the bank announced plans for a huge share buyback valued at about C$1.1 billion.</p>
<p>* Other strong banks included Toronto-Dominion Bank, ending up 0.55 at 26.95 after reaching a new high of 27.</p>
<p>Bank of Montreal added 0.25 to close at 33.90.</p>
<p>* Among base metals, Inco Ltd sank 0.45 to close at 43.20. Inco said its 1998 target date to start open pit mining at Voisey's Bay will be a &quot;tight&quot; deadline to meet.</p>
<p>* Fairfax Financial was the top gainer, up 10 to 260.</p>
