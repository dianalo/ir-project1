<title>RUSSIA: Lebed says Russia army near mutiny.</title>

<p>Security chief Alexander Lebed said on Thursday that the Russian army, deprived of adequate funds, was close to mutiny but the country's defence minister said situation in the armed forces was under control.</p>
<p>&quot;The army is in fact on the brink of mutiny,&quot; Lebed, a retired general and advocate of increased military spending, told a news conference. &quot;It requires a huge effort for it to restrain itself.&quot;</p>
<p>But RIA news agency quoted Defence Minister Igor Rodionov, who has warned more than once that poor funding and lack of public support harmed the army, as saying there were no grounds to believe that the military were on the point of revolting.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the situation (in the armed forces) is under control and there is a chance of turning things to the better,&quot; he said in Norway where he is meeting NATO defence ministers.</p>
<p>Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's security adviser and secretary of the powerful Security Council, had said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday that the military could go on the rampage soon because of frustration at government negligence and unpaid wages.</p>
<p>But asked at the news conference if he expected a military coup in Russia, Lebed replied: &quot;Russia does not have a historical tradition of military coups. Thank God we are not Argentina.</p>
<p>&quot;But the degradation of the army caused the (Bolshevik) revolution in 1917. It was a time when millions of armed people lost the feeling that their life had any sense and started looking for it.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed has made several controversial statements in recent weeks which have contradicted the views of other top officials, intensifying speculation that jostling for position is under way as President Boris Yeltsin prepares for heart surgery.</p>
