<headline>Russia, Bulgaria debt surge in slow LDC debt trade.</headline>

<p>Emerging market debt prices rose Monday on the back of a surging U.S. Treasury market and bullish sentiment about Russia and Bulgaria's prospects, Brady bond traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was ongoing support from Treasury side, which was the most important factor for the whole Brady market,&quot; said Kurt Schmid, managing director at SBC Warburg.</p>
<p>Eastern European paper, particularly Russian and Bulgarian, surged amid ongoing bullishness over the countries' prospects.  </p>
<p>&quot;Russia is very cheap, it's probably the cheapest country in the market relative to its credit rating,&quot; said Gary Evans, global debt strategist at UBS Securities. &quot;There's not doubt the fundamentals were improving in Bulgaria, but in Bulgaria the assets were undervalued in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>Bulgaria FLRBs BGFLIRB=RR jumped 2-1/4 to 58-3/8, whi;e Bulgaria Discounts BGFLTH24A=RR soared 2-1/4 tp 75-1/4.</p>
<p>Russian mark-denominated Vnesh loans RUVNUSLNS=RR climbed 1-1/8 to 97-/8.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 13/32 to yield 6.70 percent.  </p>
<p>Bulgarian paper also prospered from talk that the country's policymakers were involved with international investment bankers about a potential restructuring of its Brady bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;People are trying to position themselves in anticipation,&quot; one U.S. investor said.</p>
<p>Not all market players readily believed that Bulgaria had changed so dramatically since it presented its plans for economic reform and pegging the lev to the German mark.</p>
<p>&quot;All boats rise with the tide,&quot; one Brady trader said. &quot;I haven't heard any news that would prompt me to think that (Bulgaria) has its act together any more than it did six months ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Among Latin American issues, Argentine FRBs ARFLC05=RR slipped 1/8 to 94-1/4, while Brazilian Cs BR8D14=RR closed up 1/4 to 81-5/8.</p>
