<p>The early zloty eased against the basket of currencies and was seen losing more ground as foreign investors would sell Polish paper after the central bank said the likelyhood of a rate rise was growing, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;After the central bank statement foreign players are likely to close their fixed interest Polish positions,&quot; said Malgorzata Sawicka of Bank Handlowy SA.</p>
<p>NBP president Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz told the Gazeta Wyborcza daily that next year's planned budget deficit of 1.9 percent, instead of a balanced budget, made a rate rise more likely because of the need to cool domestic demand.  </p>
<p>At 0810 GMT the zloty was at 0.80/0.75 percent above the trading band centre against 1.11/1.02 at opening. It was at 3.2955/66 against the dollar and 1.8788/00 against the mark from 3.2775/95 and 1.8735/55 at opening respectively.</p>
<p>Dealers said, however, foreign zloty-selling was likely to be gentle and gradual, with the level of 0.5 percent above parity rate providing strong support for the Polish unit.</p>
<p>On the money market two- and three-month rate rose 0.3 point at bid to 22.50 percent on the NBP statement. One-day rates rose 0.2 point to 23.15/23.55 percent but dealers said it had more to do with liquidity than a potential rate rise.</p>
