<title>VIETNAM: State-owned banks may buy into Vietnam's VP Bank.</title>
<headline>State-owned banks may buy into Vietnam's VP Bank.</headline>
<dateline>HANOI 1997-04-21</dateline>

<p>Two state-owned Vietnamese banks are likely to buy up to 10 percent each of VP Bank's equity when the troubled private institution increases its capital in coming days, a senior VP Bank official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the central bank) have decided to support us, and maybe in the very near future the state-owned banks will become our shareholders,&quot; said the official, speaking anonymously.</p>
<p>He named the two state-owned banks as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam (Incombank) and the Vietnam Bank for Investment and Development.</p>
<p>The official said that VP Bank, whose full name is the Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for Private Enterprises, planned to increase its registered capital to 250 billion dong ($21.46 million) from 175 billion dong.</p>
<p>He said VP Bank's two foreign shareholders, both investment funds with 10 percent each, would probably participate in the capital increase to keep their stakes at the same level.</p>
<p>An official at the Dublin-listed Vietnam Fund declined to comment and officials at Dragon Capital, which is part of the Dublin-listed Vietnam Enterprise Investments Ltd, were not available to comment.</p>
<p>However, banking sources said that state-owned banks were resisting pressure from the central State Bank of Vietnam to subscribe to VP Bank's capital increase.</p>
<p>An official at the Bank for Development and Investment denied that there were plans for his bank to buy into VP Bank.</p>
<p>VP Bank, which in 1995 became the first of Vietnam's private banks to have foreign shareholders, has been in the spotlight in recent weeks after failing to honour a $3 million-letter of credit.</p>
<p>News of that default has sparked fears over a liquidity crunch in the banking system and the weight of short-term debt on banks' books.</p>
<p>One industry source said earlier this month that VP Bank was negotiating to extend the payment date on a clutch of letters of credit worth $19 million.</p>
<p>In a bid to put the bank back on an even keel, the management has been shaken up and five joint-stock banks -- including VP Bank -- earlier this month set up a mutual cooperation fund to provide each other with emergency liquidity.</p>
