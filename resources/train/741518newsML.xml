<p>Vietnam announced success on Sunday in nationwide polls for a new National Assembly, reporting turnout levels at 100 percent in many areas hours before voting closed.</p>
<p>The official Vietnam News Agency said some districts had achieved 100 percent turnout shortly after 07.00 a.m. local time, meaning that many polling stations could close hours ahead of time.</p>
<p>Election officials said full results were not expected to be known before Wednesday. Local police in Hanoi, Hue and Ho Chi Minh City said the day had passed without incident.</p>
<p>Sunday's polls were for an enlarged 450-seat parliament, an increase of 55 seats from the current legislature. But as usual for an election in Vietnam -- a communist state where only one party is permitted by law -- little was being left to chance.</p>
<p>Hanoi residents woke to the sound of stirring music from the city-wide megaphone network and messages instructing people on how to fulfil their civic duties.</p>
<p>Outside the city's 1,540 polling stations, middle-aged women in traditional silk dress encouraged passers-by to participate in the official atmosphere of festivity.</p>
<p>All 663 candidates were officially approved. Most were members of the ruling communist party, and 202 were women -- complying accurately with state directives aimed at ensuring they occupy around 30 percent of parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Communist Party chief, Do Muoi, told reporters at a morning voting session that democracy was growing in Vietnam every day. He also brushed aside local newspaper claims of official cheating in the constituency where he voted.</p>
<p>&quot;We have conducted so far nine assembly elections, and no cheating has been noticed,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;And the candidates do not have to spend money to buy votes.&quot;</p>
<p>The total budget for the elections and campaigning was about $17,000, amounting to a little over $25 per candidate.</p>
<p>National Assembly elections are held every five years in Vietnam, and are touted as a mechanism aimed at allowing ordinary people a say in the selection of grass-roots parliamentary representatives chosen by the state.</p>
<p>The assembly meets twice each year, for a month, to discuss government legislation and vote on nominees for cabinet and top state positions.</p>
<p>Traditionally, it has been viewed as compliant. But in an unusually direct editorial on Sunday a Ho Chi Minh City news journal said changing times in Vietnam required a more mature parliament, and one more in touch with popular opinion.</p>
<p>&quot;As it integrates into the global community, Vietnam cannot feel satisfied with where it is now,&quot; the Tuoi Tre newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;The opinions (of National Assembly deputies) could be more powerful if new ideas are expressed, and if these are a result of refined wisdom and the initiatives of many people...&quot;</p>
<p>One of the first tasks of the assembly, when it meets in September, will be to vote on the appointment of a new president and prime minister.</p>
<p>Le Duc Anh, 76, and Vo Van Kiet, 74, did not stand for election and are therefore constitutionally bound to step down.</p>
<p>Muoi, 80, the third member of Vietnam's leadership triumvirate, said he too was tired and had asked to retire. But he sidestepped questions about when this might be.</p>
<p>&quot;I am now asking the party and people to allow me to rest, but they have not yet allowed it,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I am trying my best to be allowed.&quot;</p>
