<p>Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso will not give in to lawmakers opposed to a proposed pay and pensions ceiling within the government's civil service reform bill, the president said in an interview with weekly Veja magazine.</p>
<p>Brazil's lower house suspended a vote on the bill last week at the request of government whips. A deputy close to the government said the decision to call the vote had been taken amid concerns the government then lacked enough votes to reach the three-fifths required for a constitutional amendment.  </p>
<p>The government had earlier reached an agreement with disgruntled members of the chamber of deputies on an amendment to the bill which would soften the blow of the proposed 10,800 reais ($10,188) monthly ceiling on pay and pensions for public sector workers.</p>
<p>The amendment would have allowed public workers to hold on to one pension of a maximum of 10,800 reais on top of their current salaries, even if that took them over the 10,800 real limt.</p>
<p>But deputies who are lobbying for a less rigorous pay and pensions ceiling were said to have doubted the government's backing and withdrew their support for the vote on the floor.  </p>
<p>In the interview published on Sunday, Cardoso said a civil servant could not complain about receiving 10,800 reais a month when the minimum salary was 112 reais ($106) a month.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot agree with the existence of maharajahs,&quot; Cardoso said.</p>
<p>In the interview Cardoso said constitutional reforms needed to be passed quickly but that they were not central to the government's anti-inflationary &quot;real&quot; plan.</p>
<p>&quot;These reforms have to be resolved soon, this semester. Because afterwards Congress will enter a vacuum and will not vote on anything,&quot; Cardoso said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is not a central issue ... (Reforms) are important but to say that the real plan depends on reforms are a lie,&quot; he added.</p>
