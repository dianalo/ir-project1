<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>A senior Turkish official on Tuesday defended his country's increased trade with Iran and Iraq and sought to reassure the United States that did not mean that the nation was turning away from the West.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to increase our trade relations with neighboring countries, not only Iran and Iraq, but also all over the region, as well as with the EU (European Union) and the U.S.,&quot; central bank governor Gazi Ercel said.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Ercel also said that Turkey's Islamist-led government was putting together a three-year plan to drive down inflation and would welcome international support for it, including loans from the IMF.</p>
<p>Ercel accompanied Turkish State Minister Fehim Adak to the United States on a three-day visit that ends on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two men have already met a number of senior U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, as well as International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus and World Bank President James Wolfensohn.</p>
<p>&quot;The meetings were very good,&quot; Ercel said.</p>
<p>Washington has been concerned by Turkey's increased ties with Iran, Iraq and Libya, fearing they could signal a shift away from the West by the strategically important nation.</p>
<p>U.S. officials were said to be particularly annoyed by Turkey's recent $23 billion agreement to buy natural gas from Iran, a country seen as a major threat by Washington.</p>
<p>Ercel though argued that Turkey's trade with Iran paled in comparison with that of some European countries, including France and Italy, which have both imported more from, and exported more to, Tehran than has Ankara.</p>
<p>The central bank chief also sought to assuage fears among U.S. and IMF officials that Turkey's economy is shaky after inflation soared to 80 percent last year.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some good signs for the Turkish economy,&quot; Ercel said. &quot;It is doing better than expected.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the positives: a lower-than-expected inflation rate of 3.4 percent in December, improved tax collection that helped contain the budget deficit to the equivalent of eight percent of gross domestic product last year and strong foreign currency and gold reserves of $16 billion to $17 billion.</p>
<p>Ercel said he expects inflation to come down in the next two or three months, and if that happens, interest rates should follow. Annualized inflation should drop below 70 percent in the second half of this year if Turkey pursues the right economic policies, he added.</p>
<p>According to the central bank head, Ankara wants to drive annual inflation down to single-digit levels in the next two to three years through a plan that includes stepped-up privatisation and reform of the tax and state pension systems.</p>
<p>&quot;The program will be welcomed by the IMF and by the World Bank,&quot; Ercel predicted.</p>
<p>An IMF team is expected to visit Ankara in the next few weeks for talks on the economic program, he added.</p>
<p>Although Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has voiced opposition in the past to loan agreements with the IMF, Ercel made clear the country would welcome Fund support.</p>
<p>The Turkish public sector faces a foreign debt bill of $7 billion in 1997, including principal and interest payments, Ercel said.</p>
<p>Ankara wants to avoid raising that money domestically because that would put upward pressure on interest rates.</p>
<p>The central bank chief said the money could be raised abroad, including from the IMF, World Bank and the global capital markets, if Turkey's planned economic program is seen as acceptable.</p>
