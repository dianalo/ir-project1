<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday eliminated a corporate filing fee in a move that is expected to save corporations about $9 million annually, the SEC said.</p>
<p>The so-called Independent Offices Approriations Act (IOAA) fees were first imposed in 1972 to help pay the cost of running the agency, the nation's top securities watchdog.</p>
<p>The fees range from $100 to $500 and are collected from companies filing financial reports, preliminary proxy statements, tender offers and requests for rule exemptions.  </p>
<p>The SEC said it agreed with House of Representatives Commerce Committee Chairman, Thomas Bliley, a Virginia Republican, to do away with the fees.</p>
<p>The reason, it said, was that the fees collected were less than 2.0 percent of all fees it collects. But processing by the SEC staff of the IOAA fees were &quot;disproportionately burdensome,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>SEC Chairman Levitt said: &quot;As any corporate chief executive will tell you, if you are spending 50 percent of your effort collection two percent of your revenue, you need to rethink your priorities.&quot;  </p>
<p>Bliley commended Levitt for the effort and said he was &quot;very optimistic&quot; that a bill deregulating the securities induutry would be enacted before Congress adjourns this year.</p>
<p>The bill includes a compromise Bliley worked out with the White House that would reduce the SEC's corporate registration fees by $850 million over a 10 year period.</p>
<p>The fees to be reduced and the IOAA fees are more than double the operating budget of the SEC, which is about $300 million.</p>
<p>The securities bill is currently pending in a House-Senate conference committee. Legislative aides said a number of issues still need to be worked out, including varying versions on how to effectively regulate the burgeoning investment advisory business.</p>
