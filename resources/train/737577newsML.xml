<p>Australian consumers' inflationary expectations nudged up to 3.3 percent in July from a record low of 3.2 percent in June, the Melbourne Institute said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, median expectations had come down 1.0 percentage point and were still close to all time lows despite the small increase, the Institute said.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past five years, expectations have hovered around 4.0 percent,&quot; it said .&quot;However, the past nine months has seen a significant downward shift with expectations now close to 3.5 percent.&quot;  </p>
<p>On wage expectations, the survey found the majority of employees, 53 percent, expect no change in hourly wages received over the next 12 months, the Institute said.</p>
<p>This resulted in a median expectations close to zero, although on average terms employees looked for a 2.9 percent rise in wages over the period.</p>
<p>The survey also found a majority, 50 percent, reported no change in actual wages over the past year agains producing a median close to zero.</p>
<p>Averaging produced a rise of 3.0 percent for the year with a wide discrepancy between the low and high paid.  </p>
<p>The Institute said households with an annual income of less than A$20,000 reported a 4.4 percent fall in wages while those earnings more than A$71,000 reported an increase of 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Should this trend continue, it may provide some evidence of a further widening of the income gap between the lowest and highest paid workers,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>March quarter data showed that the consumer price index rose 1.3 percent over the past year.</p>
