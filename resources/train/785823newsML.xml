<title>USA: Fisher Scientific to be acquired by investor for $1.4 billion.</title>
<headline>Fisher Scientific to be acquired by investor for $1.4 billion.</headline>
<dateline>HAMPTON, N.H.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fisher Scientific Inc. said Thursday it agreed to be acquired by an investor group including Thomas H. Lee Co., a Boston-based private equity firm, in a transaction valued at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Fisher Scientific, based in Hampton, N.H., is a provider of products and services to heathcare, research, industrial, educational and government customers in 145 countries.</p>
<p>In late June, Fisher Chief Executive Paul Montrone was said to be under fire by the company's then-largest shareholder, an investment partnership of the Bass brothers of Texas. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trinity I Fund Limited Partnership was talking with other larger holders to seek support for his ouster and other plans.</p>
<p>Trinity I had suggested it was prepared to launch a takeover bid of up to $1 billion for Fisher if the company did not move to boost its share price.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal announced Thursday, which appears to scotch the Bass brothers' plans, approximately 97 percent of Fisher's common stock will be converted into the right to receive $51 per share in cash. The remaining shares will be retained by existing stockholders and will represent approximately 10.3 percent common stock ownership in the new, recapitalized company.</p>
<p>Other investors in the deal include DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and Chase Capital Partners, Fisher said.</p>
<p>A Fisher spokesman said Thomas H. Lee would be the largest shareholder in the recapitallized company, but that the size of Lee's, DLJ's and Chase's stakes were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Additionally, Fisher announced second-quarter earnings of $9.6 million, or 46 cents per share, up from $8.4 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales rose to $542.6 million from $532 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Continued growth in Fisher's research, safety, international and manufacturing businesses during the period was partially offset by lower sales to the U.S. clinical laboratory market and the adverse impact of the strong U.S. dollar on international sales, the company said.</p>
<p>Fisher said it has been affected by the ongoing strike at United Parcel Service of America, Inc., which it said it uses for a significant portion of its domestic shipments.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the company has implemented a logistics plan to minimise the impact of the current strike, a prolonged work stoppage at UPS could have an adverse impact on future results of the company,&quot; Fisher said.</p>
<p>Founded in 1974, Thomas H. Lee Co. currently manages approximately $3 billion of committed capital. Recent transactions include Experian (formerly TRW) Information Systems, Homeside Lending, Rayovac, Safelite Glass and Syratech.</p>
<p>Fisher stock was down $1.4375 at $49.4375 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
