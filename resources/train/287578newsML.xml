<p>The Kuwait Stock Exchange share index was stable in December compared to November, but volume and value fell, an exchange official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The index eased less than one percent. Volume of traded shares and their value fell,&quot; said an official.</p>
<p>The index edged down 0.8 points to 1,905.6. Value of traded shares dropped 40.0 percent to 435.0 million dinars. Volume fell 36.1 percent to 1.49 billion shares, official figures show.</p>
<p>Dealers have said anticipation of year-end results by listed firms and caution by portfolio managers trying to show the highest profit possible at the end of the year were among the key reasons for the decline in activity.</p>
<p>Banks were the most active by value with 29.5 percent of total trade value. Investment firms came second with 23.8 percent followed by property firms with 17.3 percent.</p>
<p>Over the year, the share index rose some 40 percent at the end of 1996. Value of traded shares rose 202 percent to 5.76 billion dinars in 1996 compared with 1995 and volume rose 184 percent to 25.7 billion shares in the same period, an exchange official has said.</p>
<p>Only nationals of Gulf Arab states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait -- can trade on the exchange. Kuwait's foreign residents are allowed to take part in mutual funds run by Kuwaiti firms.</p>
<p>Kuwait has said it was considering a plan to remove the ban on foreign participation but no time frame was set.</p>
