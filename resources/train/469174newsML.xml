<text>
<p>Former Australian governor-general Bill Hayden said on Thursday that there were glaring defects in the Native Title Act on aboriginal land ownership rights.</p>
<p>Hayden said he was expressing concern as part of his report to the Queensland state government as chief negotiator in recent unsuccessful land right negotiations over the A$1 billion Century Zinc project in far north Queensland.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is a glaring defect of the Native Title Act's right-to-negotiate process that one self-appointed claimant.... could frustrate a successful outcome to these processes,&quot; Hayden said in his letter to Queensland premier Rob Borbidge.</p>
<p>The Century project is currently owned by Anglo-Australian mining house RTZ Plc-CRA Ltd but the group has agreed to sell the project to local base metals firm Pasminco Ltd for A$345 million, subject to resolution of any land rights claims.</p>
