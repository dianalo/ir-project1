<p>Bridgestone and several other consumers were said to have sought offers on Wednesday as activity perked up in the Singapore rubber market following the sharp rise in the Japanese rubber market, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bridgestone asked for some offers but I don't know if they made any bids. The level of activity in the market rose after the Japanese market climbed so strongly,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders said some buyers held back, however, because they feel the rise in Japan may just be temporary.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people believe this is a temporary rally. Fundamentally, the market is still soft,&quot; another trader said.  </p>
<p>Rumours also swirled in the market that the Thai government has taken delivery of more than 10,000 tonnes of RSS3 grade rubber to help alleviate tight supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>Rubber producers were also seeking higher offer prices and were reluctant to sell in the market, they said. &quot;I tried to bid for some June RSS3, but there were no takers,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>At 0945 GMT, June RSS3 was seen at 110.00-111.00 U.S. cents a kg from 109.50 cents. June RSS1 was seen at 159.75 Singapore cents (US$1.11) a kg from 158.25 cents. September TSR20 was seen at 155.75 Singapore cents (US$1.09) a kg from 153.75 cents.</p>
