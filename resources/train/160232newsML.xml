<p>Zaire's ailing president Mobutu Sese Seko, whose country is on the brink of war with Rwanda, is up and about in the tranquil Swiss town of Lausanne and in a good mood, staff at his luxury hotel said on Friday.</p>
<p>The French daily Le Monde reported on Friday that Mobutu, 66, who underwent surgery for prostate cancer in Lausanne's University Hospital on August 22, was exhausted by radiotherapy and that his state of health prevented him from going home.</p>
<p>Quoting Mobutu's medical aides, it said that cancer had spread to his bones.</p>
<p>But a senior staff member at the Beau-Rivage Palace hotel in Lausanne said Mobutu appeared to be coming and going as he had over the past weeks while receiving medical treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw the president yesterday (Thursday). We shook hands and said hello to each other. He didn't look like someone who's dying,&quot; the senior hotel staff member said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu looks just fine,&quot; he added. &quot;You couldn't tell he's sick. He has his hair and he walks without support.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials at the University Hospital, citing professional medical secrecy, refused to comment on the Le Monde article.</p>
<p>A senior Swiss doctor heading the radiology service told Reuters by telephone: &quot;Mobutu's health is a medical secret. I am not allowed to talk to anyone about Mobutu.&quot;</p>
<p>Zairean officials at the hotel put the phone down on journalists seeking comment.</p>
<p>Mobutu is now into his third month in Switzerland and his current visa to stay in the country expires on November 27.</p>
<p>But scarcely can his absence and silence have been more alarming: east Zaire is in crisis, the U.N. has lost contact with 500,000 refugees on the run and the West, the United Nations and aid agencies are scrambling to find a way out.</p>
<p>In Geneva, Augustine Mahiga, a senior U.N. refugee agency official who is coordinator for Africa's troubled Great Lakes region, told Reuters his organisation had been unable to have any contact with Mobutu.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Raymond Chretien, the new U.N. envoy to Central Africa, told reporters in New York he would stop in Lausanne to see Mobutu before he leaves for the region in the coming week. A U.N. spokeswoman in Geneva said no date had been fixed.</p>
<p>Mobutu, an international pariah banned from much of Europe and the United States and reputed to be among the world's richest men, has more than $4 billion stashed away in Swiss banks according to Swiss media reports.</p>
<p>Some diplomats speculate that it is perfect time for a coup in the vast, anarchic Central African country and that Mobutu may never be able to go home.</p>
<p>Like an old-fashioned King, Mobutu's self-awarded titles include &quot;the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake&quot;, as well as &quot;Messiah&quot;, &quot;Liberator&quot; and &quot;Helmsman&quot;.</p>
