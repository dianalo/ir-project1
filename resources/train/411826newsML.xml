<p>The decision by French car group Renault SA to shut its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels caused a storm of protest from Belgium and unions on Friday but it cheered the stock market.</p>
<p>Investors welcomed news of what they saw as Renault getting tto grips with its relatively high cost structure and boosted the shares more than 10 percent. That came on top of a five percent gain made on Thursday when the closure was announced.</p>
<p>But Belgian officials and newspaper were shocked at the death sentence for the plant. Car workers at Vilvoorde near Brussels, the home town of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, blocked the factory and prevented finished cars from leaving.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium that includes Vilvoorde, summoned Renault chairman Louis Schweitzer for a meeting in Brussels on Saturday.</p>
<p>Luc van den Brande said he was &quot;profoundly shocked by the brutal and unacceptable decision to close the Renault factory at Vilvoorde, which is not based on any objective economic grounds.&quot;</p>
<p>The French Communist-led CGT union, outraged by the decision and fearing similar moves in France, called for &quot;social disobediance&quot; among its Renault members and joined other French unions in calling for a national day of protest on March 20.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing that counts is the wish of the financial world and of 'God CAC-40',&quot; the CGT said in a statement referrring to France's CAC-40 blue-chip share index.</p>
<p>The CGT asked for further work stoppages at the Cleon and Douai plants. Another union, the CFDT, said it wanted to contact foreign unions to protest against the cynicism with which Renault had decided to close the Belgian plant.</p>
<p>The Force Ouvriere union said it expected more bad news shortly and feared another 3,000 jobs could be lost in 1997 among the 78,000 car workers at Renault plants in France.</p>
<p>French Labour Minister Jacques Barrot said on France Inter radio &quot;the closure of (the plant in) Belgium is not a closure against Belgium. It is a technical closure because this plant made several models (Megane and Clio) at the time and was not functional.&quot;</p>
<p>The French government still has a 46 percent stake in Renault, which was partially privatised in two stages in 1994 and 1996 and used to be a bastion of labour union power.</p>
<p>The company is expecting a sharp loss for 1996 -- estimated by a leading French financial newspaper at more than four billion francs ($701 million) -- because of weak markets, high costs and despite the launch of innovative car models such as the Megane.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the government turned down a request by Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen to pay the bulk of a massive early retirement scheme.</p>
<p>The companies want to reduce the average age and size of their workforce, among the oldest in the European car industry, to survive competition which is expected to become even fiercer when the market opens fully to Japanese competition in 2000.</p>
<p>Already Japanese car groups like Toyota , Nissan and Mitsubishi are taking a growing part of the European market under a voluntary import quota agreement.</p>
<p>At 1415 GMT, Renault shares were nearly 12 percent up at 144.7 francs, while the CAC-index was down 0.54 percent at 2,615. ($ = 5.708 French Francs)</p>
