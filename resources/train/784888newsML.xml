<title>MALAYSIA: KL KEY INDEX ENDS 2.46 PCT DOWN ON BLUE-CHIP SALES.</title>
<headline>KL KEY INDEX ENDS 2.46 PCT DOWN ON BLUE-CHIP SALES.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-08-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The key blue-chip stocks index plunged 2.46 percent on Thursday as foreign investors continued to dump large capitalised stocks, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index ended 23.41 points down at 928.33. The small capitalised Second Board index too followed suit, ending down 2.63 percent, or 13.81 points, to 511.01.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the same story. People were dumping the stock almost completely unopposed. There was no buying interest at all,&quot; said a dealer with a bank-backed brokerage.  </p>
<p>Earlier, the Composite Index hit a low of 926.95 points, a new 22-month low.</p>
<p>Dealers said volumes remained low at 245 million shares. Losers swamped gainers 631 to 68.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the key resistance at 950 was broken on Tuesday, people are even more afraid. It is like a bottomless pit now,&quot; said an analyst with a Malaysian brokerage.</p>
<p>But, many analysts said they expected the next support for the key index between 850 and 880. A Reuters poll of 10 analysts on Wednesday showed 907-point level as the immediate average support for the index.  </p>
<p>&quot;We dare not predict too assertively. Until now every support level has been just passed by, without even token resistance,&quot; said Phua Lee Kerk, research head at Jupiter Securities.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said late on Thursday that he expected local funds to start buying soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect local funds to come in. If I were a player, I would come in and buy,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Dealers said this assertion was unlikely to have much impact unless local funds actually started buying activity.</p>
<p>Share prices have fallen by 7.4 percent after Malaysia on Sunday announced a $2.0 million limit on non-trade currency swaps by local banks with foreigners and on Monday released a 2.8 billion ringgit trade deficit for June.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not worried. It is usual for fund managers to pull out at such times because they are afraid of bad times,&quot; Mahathir said when asked to comment on the sharp fall in stock prices.</p>
<p>On Thursday, index heavyweights Telekom, Maybank, Sime Darby, Tenaga and Malaysia Airlines, fell between 15 and 30 cents each.</p>
<p>Genting fell 40 cents to 10.6 ringgit. It announced a two percent decline in its net profit for the first six months after the market closed, but analysts said a decline was expected.</p>
<p>Genting's 54-percent owned Resorts World, which reported a 10 percent fall in first half net profit, earlier ended 10 cents up at 7.75 ringgit.</p>
