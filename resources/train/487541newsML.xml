<p>Two major Japanese banks lowered their earnings forecasts on Friday for the 1996/97 financial year due to appraisal losses on their stock holdings and disposal of bad loans.</p>
<p>Daiwa Bank Ltd said it was slashing its parent current profit forecast for the year that ended on March 31 to two billion yen from 24 billion yen.</p>
<p>Nippon Trust Bank, a subsidiary of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said it expected to post a parent current loss of 2.5 billion yen against its previous forecast of a one billion yen profit.</p>
<p>Major Japanese banks are expected to announce their earnings for the 1996/97 financial year at the end of May.</p>
<p>A Daiwa Bank official said the bank had sharply lowered its forecast for parent current profits because of big appraisal losses on its securities holdings and unexpected loss provisions on loans provided to three financial firms affiliated with Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB).</p>
<p>The three non-bank financial firms affiliated with NCB filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, in line with a radical restructuring programme announced by NCB on that same day.</p>
<p>&quot;We consulted with auditors on how we should treat the loans to the affiliates,&quot; the official said. &quot;The auditors advised us to set aside loan loss reserves because the amount of outstanding loans to them was big and the bankruptcy filing was announced soon after the (last) business year ended.&quot;</p>
<p>Daiwa's appraisal losses on securities holdings have been estimated at 111.8 billion yen and loan losses to the NCB affiliates projected at 132 billion yen.</p>
<p>A Nippon Trust official said, however, that the latest earnings forecast did not include expected losses stemming from the failures of the three non-banks. Banking sources said that Nippon Trust had 4.8 billion yen in loans outstanding to the three firms.</p>
<p>Analysts say more big Japanese banks will revise their 1996/97 business forecasts in order to dispose of loans to the NCB affiliates.</p>
<p>But Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd, Sanwa Bank Ltd, Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd are unlikely to change their forecasts as they have already revised down their projections in the past few weeks to aggressively deal with losses on problem loans, they said.</p>
<p>A Sumitomo Bank official said on Thursday that the bank would not set aside losses for the loans in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Katsushito Sasajima, a Nikko Research Center analyst, said: &quot;Banks are considering how they should handle loan losses to the three affiliates.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even if they decide to set aside loss reserves to cover them in 1996/97, it is unlikely they will post losses because their operating profits are bigger than earlier projections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Japanese banks have been eager to speed up problem loan disposals as Japan will introduce a new system to calculate banks' financial health, the so-called prompt corrective action (PCA) system, in April 1998.</p>
<p>Prior to the launch of the system, big banks plan to reveal details of their loan disposals under the PCA system from the first half of 1997/98.</p>
