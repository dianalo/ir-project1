<p>AMP Investments Ltd said on Thursday the New Zealand share market was not over priced.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference on the company's September quarter results, AMP Investments General Manager Roger Greville said the share market was not over priced and while bonds were giving good yields they &quot;could be considered on the low side following recent falls&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The property market remains sound,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to maintain a solid exposure to New Zealand assets.&quot;  </p>
<p>But AMP would be maintaining a high exposure to property and cash.</p>
<p>AMP had since the end of the quarter increased its exposure to New Zealand equities by taking some money out of cash.</p>
<p>AMP said that despite New Zealand's inconclusive election outcome it has seen nothing so far to change its view that major changes to the thrust of economic policy are unlikely.</p>
<p>Greville said the biggest influence on New Zealand market would come from offshore where the outlook was reasonably positive.  </p>
<p>He said there was some question mark about inflation influences in the U.S. and good news had largely been fully built in to the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Greville said that despite noises from the left-wing Alliance Party that the New Zealand's balance of payments deficit was a problem, he did not see it that way.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not concerned about the balance of payments deficit,&quot; he said. &quot;We do not think it is a structural problem in the economy.&quot;  </p>
<p>Greville said whether it was the centre left or centre right which governed, it was important to maintain an open economy committed to fiscal responsibility and low inflation.</p>
<p>He said it would be difficult for the Reserve Bank to work effectively and keep inflation low if it had multiple targets as advocated by NZ First, which wants the bank to target growth and employment as well as price stability.</p>
<p>Restrictions on foreign investment advocated by New Zealand First, which holds the balance of power, would also cause concern to foreign investors.  </p>
<p>AMP said it had a 2.7 percent gross return in the September quarter for its balanced medium-risk fund against 5.0 percent in the year ago quarter, and against the industry benchmark of 3.3 percent for the September 1996 quarter.</p>
