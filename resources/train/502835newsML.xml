<p>King Hassan of Morocco, who presides at the Al-Qods (Jerusalem) Committee, called on the Moslem world on Friday to give financial support to Jerusalem and its Palestinian citizens.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the official MAP news agency, the king called for &quot;solidarity with this holy city&quot;.</p>
<p>He said &quot;political efforts (of Islamic countries) should necessarily be accompanied by a material and financial effort to preserve Jerusalem's identity, defend its integrity and protect its monuments&quot;.</p>
<p>Last month the committee, which held its 16th meeting in Morocco, called on Arabs and Islamic states -- which had taken steps towards establishing relations with Israel in the framework of the Middle East peace process -- &quot;to revise their ties with Israel, including the closure of missions and offices&quot;.</p>
<p>It said the recommendation &quot;will remain effective&quot; until Israel respected United Nations resolutions related to the peace process and commitments made in Oslo and Madrid, MAP said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is necessary that the deployed political efforts and continuing resistance are accompanied by other efforts...In this context we call today on Moslems and their elites for financial support to reduce sufferings of Palestinians,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>King Hassan, as chairman of Al-Qods Committee and the Organisation of Islamic Conference, earlier demanded the setting up of the Beit al-Mal fund, which will enable Moslems around the world to give financial support to their Palestinian brothers, MAP added.</p>
<p>It gave no details of the fund's initial capital. According to Palestinian diplomats, the fund is expected to be set up next week.</p>
<p>Since its creation in 1976, the Committee has held 16 sessions, 15 of them in Morocco under the chairmanship of King Hassan.</p>
<p>Members are Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Guinea, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Niger, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Senegal, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
