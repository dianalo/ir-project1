<p>U.S. stocks were battered by profit-taking at midday Thursday, giving up some of the stunning gains triggered by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to Congress on the economy.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which soared earlier in the week when Greenspan allayed concerns about a possible rise in interest rates, was off around 89 points to 7999.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite slid about 10 points to 1558.</p>
<p>The long bond, strong at the start of the session, slipped 2/32 to yield 6.44 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's nothing but profit-taking,&quot; said John Cleland, chief investment strategist at Security Benefit Group of Cos. &quot;We get these huge run-ups in a day or two, then people start to take some profits out of the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The profit-taking was widespread and came despite solid corporate earnings announcements and a rosy outlook for the U.S. economy, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still some investors who are concerned about valuations,&quot; said Robert Froelich, chief investment strategist at Kemper Funds. &quot;These declines are certainly not driven by earnings disappointments or inflation concerns.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts said most second quarter earnings have come in as forecast or higher than Wall Street estimates, providing support for the equities markets.</p>
<p>Digital Equipment Corp reported fiscal fourth quarter profits of $0.75 per share, compared to a loss of $2.87 a year earlier, which included $492 million in restructuring charges. The First Call consensus estimate was $0.73 per share. The company said its board had authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million shares.</p>
<p>Digital's stock gained 1-3/8 to 41-3/8.  </p>
<p>Colgate-Palmolive Co posted second quarter earnings of $0.58 per share versus $0.49 in the year-ago quarter and a First Call estimate of $0.56. The stock gained 1/16 to 75-7/16.</p>
<p>AirTouch Communications Inc surged after reporting second quarter earnings of $0.21 per share, against Wall Street's estimate of $0.14.</p>
<p>&quot;Earnings reports have been very good,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.</p>
<p>But breadth was negative, with declining issues leading gainers on the New York Stock Exchange by eight to five.  </p>
<p>&quot;Transports are weak...bonds are weak, Nasdaq's weak -- it's profit-taking more than anything else,&quot; said Warren Epstein, director of trading at Richard Rosenblatt.</p>
<p>The Dow Transport index shed 32 points to 2876.</p>
<p>Delta Air Lines lost 11/16 to 87-1/2 after posting fourth quarter earnings of $3.98 per primary share, compared to $2.69 a year ago. The First Call estimate was $4.03.</p>
<p>Mallinckrodt Inc agreed to buy medical products supplier Nellcor Puritan Bennett Inc in a deal valued at $1.9 billion. Nellcor rose 7-1/8 to 28-1/16.</p>
