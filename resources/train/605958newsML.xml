<headline>Telefonica shares up two pct, volume heavy.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Telefonica soared on Thursday, bucking the blue-chip index trend backed by a broad range of buyers among which foreign investors figured prominently, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 1415 GMT, Telefonica was up 75 pesetas, 1.78 percent, to 4,295, off a high of 4,345. Meanwhile the Ibex-35 blue chip index was down 0.6 percent to 6,409.09.</p>
<p>Traded volume was heavy, at almost  five million shares.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was no specific reason for the rise, apart from the fact that Telefonica is thought to be a safe bet among equities despite its spectacular performance already this year.</p>
<p>&quot;People in general in the market are moving on gut feeling. If they think that a stock's getting hot, they buy and don't ask any questions,&quot; said a dealer at a Spanish bank.</p>
<p>Asked for a target price, the dealer said the stock was in &quot;free rise.&quot;</p>
<p>Other dealers said foreign investors were among the biggest buyers today, perhaps encouraged by news earlier this week that brokerage Morgan Stanley had increased its Spanish equities weighting in its model portfolio.</p>
<p>The bourse is being propelled by funds in search of higher yields after fixed income returns have fallen, mirroring key money rates.</p>
