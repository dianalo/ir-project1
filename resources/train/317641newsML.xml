<p>The head of one of France's oldest banks, due to be wound down in a row over bad property deals, was held hostage by staff for a third day on Sunday after talks with the government failed to allay employees' fears over jobs.</p>
<p>Several hundred employees have occupied property lender Credit Foncier's plush Paris headquarters since Friday, preventing top executives from leaving, to try to delay a government plan to dismantle the bank which it rescued from collapse last year.</p>
<p>But unions said Credit Foncier, which manages billions of bonds in French debt and operates low-cost housing loans on behalf of the state, would open for business on Monday to prevent a worsening of the crisis over the bank's future.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a shame we have to occupy the building and hold the managers here,&quot; union leader Alain Deleu told reporters at the scene, where staff had camped out peacefully overnight to prevent bank governor Jerome Meysonnier leaving his office.</p>
<p>&quot;We are doing this in a dignified way and we are working day by day to change things and win,&quot; Deleu said.</p>
<p>Unions extended the occupation after hastily assembled talks with Finance Minister Jean Arthuis on Saturday evening, saying he had provided nothing new on the future of nearly 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Arthuis is proposing to spin off Credit Foncier's housing loans and commercial business to another group, cooperatively run Credit Immobilier, which has pledged to take 1,500 staff.</p>
<p>But unions are campaigning for a stay of execution for Credit Foncier, which currently employs 3,300 people, in the hope of finding a rescue partner prepared to keep it intact.</p>
<p>Arthuis told reporters on Saturday the government would respect the employees' interests and remained open to other options should another buyer for the troubled bank turn up.</p>
<p>But it also had obligations to French taxpayers, he said.</p>
<p>The 145-year-old private bank ran into deep trouble last year after posting a 10.8 billion franc ($2.0 billion) loss for 1995. After no buyer turned up then, France's conservative government ordered a state bank to take over Credit Foncier and announced plans for a break-up and gradual wind-down.</p>
<p>The government said it was forced to act to prevent a bank collapse wreaking havoc in financial markets, where Credit Foncier was the second largest issuer of bonds after the state.</p>
<p>But the affair rapidly gained wider importance, highlighting close ties between the state and the banking sector, as staff and shareholders smelled an effort to sink the bank and close an embarrassing saga of losses in which the state was involved.</p>
<p>Although Credit Foncier is private, its top managers have always been named by the state because of its strategic role.</p>
<p>Unions say it was these managers who &quot;overloaded&quot; the 1995 results with massive provisions of 13.6 billion francs ($2.5 billion) for reckless property dealings in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>In another twist to the plot, state-appointed Meyssonnier has himself appeared to fall out with the Arthuis plan, saying recently that Credit Foncier is still healthy and could turn in a 1996 profit of a billion francs ($200 million).</p>
<p>The standoff is also a new test for the government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe, running a tight spending policy in the run-up to a single European currency.</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly bowed to union protests, raising the question of whether it can stay the course with its austerity budget. The government has said it would take five billion francs ($900 million) to keep the bank in one piece.</p>
