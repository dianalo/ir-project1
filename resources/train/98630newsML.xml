<p>They may lack sophisticated weapons but Filipinos who will guard Bill Clinton and other leaders at the APEC summit next month say the skills they gained battling Marxist rebels and Moslem extremists will more than compensate.</p>
<p>Intelligence officials say the U.S. President, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Indonesia's President Suharto are the &quot;high-risk&quot; leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.</p>
<p>But neither are they taking any chances with the other leaders who will arrive in Manila on November 24 and travel to nearby Subic Bay for a one-day summit on November 25.</p>
<p>&quot;We are preparing for all possible scenarios ... from the smallest to the biggest,&quot; Colonel Marcelo Navarro, chief of the anti-terrorist Special Action Force (SAF), said in an interview. &quot;We are putting everything into this. We are leaving no stone unturned. We cannot afford to fail even one percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton is the biggest security headache, both because of current tensions with Iraq and because of the prosecution of Islamic extremists in the United States, security officials say.</p>
<p>Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, convicted in the United States for plotting to bomb U.S. airliners, had strong links in the Philippines. He allegedly planted a bomb on a Philippine Airlines jet which killed one passenger, and spent several weeks here supposedly plotting other attacks.</p>
<p>Security officials suspect he had links with Filipino extremists based in the south of the country.</p>
<p>Suharto is on the &quot;high-risk&quot; list because of intelligence reports that East Timorese dissidents might sneak into the Philippines during the summit, the officials said. They added that possible threats from Japanese extremists had persuaded them to treat Hashimoto with the same security precautions as Clinton and Suharto.</p>
<p>Navarro told Reuters he was not aware of any specific threats but &quot;when you prepare (for APEC), you assume the worst&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the biggest security operation the Philippines has undertaken since we became a republic,&quot; Navarro said.</p>
<p>His 1,199-member unit, part of the Philippine National Police, has an impressive pedigree and is regarded in military circles as a &quot;special baby&quot; of President Fidel Ramos. Ramos, a former career soldier, set up the unit in 1983. It has tested its mettle in jungle skirmishes with Moslem separatists and communist New People's Army rebels.</p>
<p>Its members have also spent time in the far south, hunting down Islamic extremists and drug traffickers.</p>
<p>The SAF has been undergoing rigid training for more than a year to ensure the summit proceeds smoothly. Preparations included training with Britain's SAS on counter-insurgency techniques and the U.S. Rangers on deep reconnaissance operations.</p>
<p>Over the past week they have also trained with French security experts on shooting while riding on motorcycles. The men have also trained with Israeli commandos and Australian security experts provide additional advice later this month.</p>
<p>SAF's basic weaponry includes light machineguns, sniper rifles and pistols. To improve its firepower, it is shopping for advanced combat rifles in the United States, France and Austria, said Captain Dionardo Carlos, the second-in-command of the special operations battalion.</p>
<p>Officials said the first ring of security for APEC leaders would be their own security agents and the Philippines Presidential Security Group.</p>
<p>SAF commandos and sharpshooters will make up the second ring.</p>
<p>&quot;We have considered all avenues of fire, high-rise buildings, bridges, culverts, street intersections and public places,&quot; Navarro said.</p>
<p>The Philippines is importing 36 Mercedes Benz limousines for the summit, half of them bullet proof and the other half identical versions that will serve as decoys.</p>
<p>The summit talks in Subic will be held in a Leaders Hall with bullet proof glass panels.</p>
<p>Along routes where leaders and their ministers will travel security men have already pinpointed the locations of hospitals and clinics in case of emergency.</p>
<p>The government is also establishing the blood type of each APEC leader and making sure it has adequate supplies for each one, security sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be 100 percent confident of ourselves that nothing will happen ...,&quot; Navarro said.</p>
