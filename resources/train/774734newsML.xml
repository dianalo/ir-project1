<headline>Bomb hits Algerian train, no casualties - papers.</headline>

<p>A bomb exploded on a passenger train south of Algiers damaging a carriage but causing no casualties, Algerian newspapers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The explosion occurred on Saturday the railway linking Algiers to the western city of Oran, El Watan and Le Matin said.</p>
<p>The bomb went off as the train was at Mouzaia town in Blida province, about 50 km (30 miles) south of Algiers, the focus of a series of massacres of villagers and bloody battles pitting Moslem guerrillas against government troops in the past three weeks.</p>
<p>Algeria plunged into violence shortly after the authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead. About 60,000 people have been killed.</p>
<p>The last serious bomb explosion on a train killed 21 people and wounded 20 in the south Algiers suburb of Gue de Constantine in April.</p>
<p>The bomb explosion coincided with bloodshed returning to Algiers's streets after an apparent lull presented by the authorities as evidence that the government had the upper hand in the struggle against Moslem rebels and had kept the violence confined into remote areas.</p>
<p>A car bomb killed eight people and wounded 25 in Algiers on Wednesday, according to newspapers and residents.</p>
<p>Algeria's main newspaper, El Watan, said on Saturday scores of cars were reported stolen by suspected Moslem guerrillas who planned to use them for a new wave of bombings in the capital.</p>
