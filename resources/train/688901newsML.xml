<p>Venezuela's Ministry of Energy and Mines formally proposed its domestic oil market liberalisation plan to Congress, an official said Thursday.</p>
<p>The proposal, which may still go through many changes, envisages a year's transition to totally free gasoline and diesel markets, during which the government would raise prices in two stages, said vice-Minister of Energy and Mines Evanan Romero.</p>
<p>&quot;This law will allow the modernisation of the sector, opening the internal oil market to private participation,&quot; he told journalists.</p>
<p>Lubricants, asphalt and paraffin were already set according to free markets, he added, and this law would affect only gasoline and diesel.</p>
<p>Venezuelan gasoline and diesel are currently kept at about 85 percent of the factory gate price by government subsidies, and state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) has a monopoly over supply to gasoline stations, which are mostly privately- owned.</p>
<p>The government's plan would remove PDVSA's monopoly and increase retail prices to the factory gate level at the beginning of the transition period, Romero said. During a year, the government would set a fixed margin to retailers and only then free prices completely.</p>
<p>Romero hoped the government's bill would be approved before the end of this year, but expected active debate in parliament. A group of congress officials have drafted a rival bill that would keep some form of state control over the market.</p>
