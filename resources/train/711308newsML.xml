<title>LEBANON: Lebanon to give Red Army case verdict on July 31.</title>
<headline>Lebanon to give Red Army case verdict on July 31.</headline>

<p>A Beirut court said on Monday it would issue on July 31 the verdict in the case of five Japanese Red Army guerrillas charged with forgery and other offences that carry possible sentences of up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>&quot;The session is over and the verdict will be handed down on July 31,&quot; Judge Suheil abdel-Samad said.</p>
<p>Kazua Tohira, Haruo Wako, Mariko Yamamoto, Kozo Okamoto and Masao Adachi were arrested in Beirut in February under circumstances that have never been fully clarified after living in Lebanon for years.</p>
<p>They were charged with passport forgery and illegal entry to the country.</p>
<p>Japan had hoped to extradite them to face international justice on charges linked to guerrilla activity. Lebanon and Japan do not have an extradition agreement.</p>
<p>At the end of Monday's court session, the last before the verdict, the suspects demanded freedom and political asylum.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers said they had no criminal intention when forging documents and that the forgery was done in self-defence.</p>
<p>&quot;It is normal that they have entered the country with forged passports... The Lebanese government says fighting Israel is legitimate and they came here to train the resistance,&quot; one of the suspect's lawyers, leftist MP Najah Wakim, told the court.</p>
<p>&quot;The authorities knew that they entered the country and they knew that they remained here,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Red Army was founded in 1971. It is allied to hardline anti-Israeli Palestinian factions and carried out attacks in support of the Palestinian cause.</p>
<p>One of the suspects, Kozo Okamoto, took part in a Red Army attack in 1972 at Tel Aviv's Lod airport in which 24 people were killed and 100 wounded.</p>
<p>He was captured by Israeli forces and sentenced to life imprisonment but was released in a Palestinian-Israeli prisoner swap in May 1985.</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Boushra Khalil appealed to Lebanese authorities to grant Okamoto Lebanese citizenship to honour him.</p>
<p>&quot;I also appeal to Arab countries, especially Syria, to grant him their citizenship,&quot; she added.</p>
