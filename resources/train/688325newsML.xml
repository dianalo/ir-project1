<p>Frenchman Olivier Panis, who broke both legs when he crashed in the Canadian Grand Prix 11 days ago, hopes to be back in Formula One racing this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to race before the end of the season,&quot; Panis told a news conference on Thursday at a rehabilitation centre in Douarnenez on the Brittany coast where he has been since leaving hospital in Montreal and flying home to France on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Panis, looking pale and sitting in a wheelchair, said he was giving himself two to 2-1/2 months for a comeback.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to win races, from this year I hope. My goal remains to be world champion,&quot; he said, adding that the accident in Canada would make him stronger.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember the accident, I never lost consciousness. That's what helps my morale today,&quot; the 30-year-old driver said of his first crash during competition.</p>
<p>Panis said his comeback would be a decision made by the team, currently at Magny Cours for Sunday's French Grand Prix.</p>
<p>&quot;I remain in contact with the engineers to stay in touch with all the progress on the car and to be ready to return,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Doctors said Panis should be walking within a month but would not say how long they thought he would be at the rehabilitation centre altogether.</p>
