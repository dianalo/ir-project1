<p>Cairo brokers EFG-Hermes said on Thursday that February 21 was the deadline for tentative bids for 10 to 20 percent of the shares in monopoly cigarette manufacturer Eastern Company.</p>
<p>Investors must bid for at least 10,000 shares, up to a maximum of 500,000, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The tentative deadline is to get an idea of demand. Then it can be extended for a week or so,&quot; an EFG-Hermes official said.</p>
<p>EFG-Hermes and Bank of Alexandria are joint lead managers of the offering, which is the second stage in the privatisation of the company. The state sold 10 percent of the 25 million shares to the public in June 1995.</p>
<p>The rest of the shares are owned by the state's Holding Company for Mining and Refractories (80 percent) and by the company employees (10 percent).</p>
<p>EFG-Hermes said it was recommending that investors buy. &quot;Eastern Tobacco is experiencing improved margins due to seven to nine percent growth in consumption and payoffs from cost-cutting measures undertaken recently,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Eastern Company shares were trading at between 87 and 91.35 pounds ($25.63 and $26.91) a share on the Egyptian stock exchange on Thursday, giving a market capitalisation of up to 2.284 billion pounds.</p>
<p>The holding company said on Thursday that on the basis of promising first-half results, Eastern expected to pay out a cash dividend of 5.00 pounds a share for the financial year 1996/7. The dividend in the previous two years was 4.00 pounds.</p>
<p>The holding company said that in the first half of the financial year (July-December 1996) Eastern made profits for distribution of 87.939 million pounds ($26 million), compared with 145.820 million in the whole of 1995/6.</p>
<p>EFG-Hermes listed Eastern's strengths as including a monopoly of tobacco production in Egypt, 8.9 percent sales growth in 1996, a strong management team, a strong financial position with high turnover and a wide asset base including land worth at least 1.7 billion pounds.</p>
<p>Its weaknesses were the high level of government regulation in pricing and taxation and vulnerability to any devaluation of the pound, it added. Its prices have not gone up since 1991.</p>
