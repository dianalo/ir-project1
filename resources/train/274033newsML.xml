<p>Polish shares rose in lower turnover for the fifth consecutive session but analysts saw them falling on profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse is likely to fall or at least slow its growth as it has already risen about 1,000 points over the last two weeks and profit-taking seems unavoidable,&quot; said Jan Koch, a trader at Polish Development Bank (PBR) brokerage.</p>
<p>Analysts said the National Bank of Poland's (NBP) Monday statement that an interest rate raise might be imminent could have only limited influence on the market, which has already priced-in its earlier warnings of a rate raise.    </p>
<p>But they said if the NBP rate rise, which they expected at two percentage points maximum, materialised, it could cause falls on the bourse.</p>
<p>The main WIG index rose 1.9 percent, to 14,320.8, and turnover fell 5.3 percent to 119.4 million zlotys on both markets as 65 issues rose, seven fell and 11 were flat.</p>
<p>Continuous trade turnover amounted to 4.8 million zlotys with eight stocks falling and six staying flat.</p>
<p>Swarzedz rose 9.2 percent, surging for the third straight session on Wednesday's news that it had signed a 200-million-mark deal, traders said.</p>
