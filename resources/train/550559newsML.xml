<p>A Massachusetts judge is expected to decide by Friday whether a jury will hear statements made by a British nanny to police that she dropped on the floor a 9-month-old infant she is accused of killing.</p>
<p>At a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday, lawyers for British au pair Louise Woodward, 19, tried to convince Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel that the statements their client made to police that she &quot;dropped the baby on the floor&quot; and &quot;tossed the baby on the bed&quot; and &quot;may have been a little rough with the baby&quot; were coerced.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers Harvey Silverglate and Andrew Good argued that while police did inform Woodward of her constitutional right to remain silent, the officers also told her that doctors wanted information about what happened to the baby, Matthew Eappen, in the hours before he was admitted to Boston's Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>Earlier, Newton Police Sgt. William Byrne testified that after 10 minutes of questioning Woodward about the injuries suffered by Eappen he thought, &quot;she may have been a borderline hero ... she may have tried to revive the baby that had gone unconscious.&quot;</p>
<p>But that thought was shattered when doctors told him the head injuries suffered could not have been an accident.</p>
<p>Doctors told him that when they operated on the infant, &quot;(cranial) fluid shot up about a foot-and-a-half in the air ... the brain shot right out of the skull ... There was that much pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Woodward, who wore her light brown hair up in a braid, sat looking at the table in front of her, only occassionally glancing at Byrne. Her mother, Susan, sat in the front row of spectators and listened attentively.</p>
<p>Two other witnesses, a police detective and a lawyer who is friend of the Eappen family, Matthew McCue, testified that Woodward, who arrived in the United States in June and began working for the Eappens in November, appeared calm and composed during the questioning.</p>
<p>Judge Zobel said he would rule by Friday on the defence motions. The trial is set to begin in July.</p>
