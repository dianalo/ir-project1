<p>Israel has brushed off U.S. President Bill Clinton's criticism of its plan to build a new Jewish neighbourhood in Arab East Jerusalem, saying work will begin on the project this week.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have preferred the decision not have been made because I don't think it builds confidence. I think it builds mistrust,&quot; Clinton said at the start of a White House meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Monday.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak refused to comment on Clinton's criticism of Israel's decision last week to approve a plan to build 6,500 homes for Jews at Jabal Abu Ghneim hill, which Israel calls Har Homa.</p>
<p>But government sources were quoted by Israel's Itim news agency and by Israel's army radio as saying: &quot;The United States always opposed Israel's policy in Jerusalem and that did not interfere with Israel building in it in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>Itim also said: &quot;The government sources added that the government of Israel intended to implement its building projects throughout the city&quot;.</p>
<p>Bazak did say that Israel would begin surveying work for the new neighbourhood this week. &quot;It will begin in another day or two,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israel's approval of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem has sparked Palestinian outrage. So far, Arafat has kept a lid on violence.</p>
<p>On Monday, Palestinians shut down East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in a general strike to protest the project. The strike passed without incident.</p>
<p>Faisal al-Husseini, top Palestine Liberation Organisation official in Jerusalem, warned it was only the beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a first collective step of the Palestinian people to show that they are against this matter and they are ready to do something for that even if it will cost them a price,&quot; Husseini told Israel Television.</p>
<p>Israel's moves in Jerusalem spurred violence in September. Sixty-one Arabs and 15 Israeli soldiers died in gunbattles after Netanyahu opened a tourist tunnel near Islamic holy shrines.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. In a move not recognised internationally, it later annexed East Jerusalem, declaring it part of an indivisible capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state.</p>
<p>The sides are to begin final status peace talks within the coming weeks at which issues including Jerusalem's status, according to a framework interim peace deal, will be negotiated. The sides are to reach a final peace accord by 1999.</p>
<p>Palestinians view Israeli building in Arab East Jerusalem as preempting negotiations.</p>
<p>Alongside the decision to build for Jews, Israel said it would allow another 3,000 homes for Arabs in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israel's Peace Now movement on Monday slammed as haphazard and unlikely to be implemented what it said was the government's one-page plan for Arab construction that it had obtained. The group did not release the document.</p>
<p>Peace Now's Daniel Seidemann told Reuters: &quot;It's a hastily prepared document for purposes of public relations&quot;. Government officials were not immediately available to comment.</p>
