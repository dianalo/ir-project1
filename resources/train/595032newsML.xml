<title>USA: Asthma seen linked to violence in inner cities.</title>

<p>Inner-city violence may help explain why poor, urban children suffer unusually severe and frequent asthma attacks, a study released Monday says.</p>
<p>Researchers from Channing Laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said they found that children exposed to such violence as hearing or seeing gunshots were twice as likely as children in general to experience wheezing and use bronchodilators. They were almost three times as likely to be diagnosed with asthma after age 2.</p>
<p>The findings were presented at the American Lung Association/American Thoracic Society International Conference in San Francisco.</p>
<p>While researchers have long noticed a higher incidence of asthma among inner-city children, they typically linked this to actual air conditions resulting from cockroach infestation and the presence of other unhealthful substances in run-down apartment buildings. But the new study suggests factors other air quality may play a role.</p>
<p>&quot;If the study results confirm an association between exposure to such violence and respiratory outcomes, we will have a better understanding of the rise in the severity and frequency of asthma and its disproportionate burden on poor urban children,&quot; Dr. Rosalind Wright, the lead researcher in the study, said.</p>
<p>The researchers said they had adjusted their data so it did not reflect socioeconomic status or exposure to cigareete smoke at home.</p>
