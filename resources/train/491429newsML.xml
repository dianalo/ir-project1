<p>France welcomes New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon to Paris on Tuesday, hoping his visit will help thaw relations with Wellington that were badly chilled by French nuclear testing in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit to France by...Don McKinnon testifies to the revival of dialogue between our two countries,&quot; the French foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>McKinnon, who harshly criticised a series of French nuclear explosions in the South Pacific, is the highest-ranking New Zealand official to visit France since the tests, foreign ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette will host a lunch for McKinnon at which the two will discuss aid efforts for developing nations in the South Pacific as well as economic and other issues, Doutriaux said.</p>
<p>France and New Zealand were seriously at odds over President Jacques Chirac's decision to explode six nuclear bombs under its remote Fangataufa atoll beginning in September 1995 and ending in January 1996.</p>
<p>Since then relations have improved and trade between the two nations has been steadily increasing. Last May, New Zealand Foreign Trade Minister Philip Burdon visited France and called for a new chapter in relations.</p>
<p>McKinnon arrives in Paris from the Somme valley where he attended on Sunday a ceremony commemorating New Zealand soldiers killed in France during World War One.</p>
