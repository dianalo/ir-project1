<p>* Rupiah softened against the dollar on ample liquidity and concerns over political unrest ahead of elections.</p>
<p>* Ringgit broke through 2.5120 barrier as offshore funds accumulated dollars.</p>
<p>* Baht firmed against the dollar after the dollar weakened against the yen on Japan's March trade surplus</p>
<p>* Dollar steadied against the Singapore unit, with eyes on March trade data expected to be released on April 21.</p>
<p>Activity in most Asian currencies was mostly muted by midday on Thursday.</p>
<p>Indonesian rupiah eased against the dollar on ample liquidity and concerns over political unrest, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said operators were a bit worried at the opening, one day after a new bank reserve requirement rate became effective, but adequate supply helped calm the market.</p>
<p>A five percent reserve rate was made effective on Wednesday.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said flush rupiah supply led players to go slightly long on dollars due to the extended weekend.</p>
<p>Dealers in Singapore said demand for the dollar was likely to improve against the rupiah amid continued political unrest ahead of the Indonesian May 29 general elections.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,408.5/9.5 at 0430 GMT against an opening of 2,407.75/08.75.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia kept its intervention band at 2,401/2,593 and the conversion band at 2,401/2,449 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Indonesia market will be closed on Friday for a Moslem festival and will reopen on Monday.</p>
<p>Malaysian ringgit eased against the greenback and broke the 2.5120 barrier. Dealers said the ringgit was weighed by concerns of potential rifts among key political players in the country.</p>
<p>However, the ringgit's downside was capped by fears of Bank Negara's intervention.</p>
<p>The ringgit was seen within the 2.5100/30 range at 0430 GMT. Its support and resistance were pegged at 2.5020 and 2.5160, respectively.</p>
<p>The Thai baht strengthened against the dollar as Japan's March trade figures dampened the greenback against the yen, dealers said.</p>
<p>The baht was at 26.071/26.076 to the dollar at 0430 GMT against 26.080/26.085 late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market remained slow. But some dollar short covering by Singaporean players is likely to emerge later today ahead of the long weekend there,&quot; said one dealer at a local bank.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand set the mid-rate at 26.08 per dollar compared with 26.09 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Singapore dollar was range-bound at 1.4410-1.4420 to the dollar. Dealers said activity was light ahead of the long weekend. The market awaited March trade data, expected to be released on April 21, for a clearer indication of economic health.</p>
<p>According to dealers, non-oil domestic exports were likely to show a decline of three to six percent. A Reuters poll of economists on Thursday forecast a 4.5 percent drop.</p>
