<p>Chinese debt issues exceeded state plans in 1996, making it difficult to achieve a targeted 27-percent increase in issues in 1997, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said in his annual budget speech on Sunday.</p>
<p>China's target for domestic and overseas debt in 1997 is 248.596 billion yuan ($29.95 billion), or an increase of 27.3 percent compared with 1996, &quot;which is an arduous task&quot;, Liu told the National People's Congress, or parliament.</p>
<p>China would issue 57 billion yuan to cover the budget deficit in 1997, he said, and a further 195.908 billion yuan would be needed to service domestic and foreign debt.</p>
<p>That gives a total of 252.908 billion yuan, but a surplus of 4.312 billion yuan from bond receipts in 1996 would be deducted.</p>
<p>China issued 196.742 billion yuan in debt last year, or 1.485 billion yuan above the budgeted figure of 195.257 billion yuan. That marked an increase of 27 percent from 1995.</p>
<p>In 1996, expenditures on servicing foreign and domestic debt totalled 131.43 billion yuan, or 2.385 billion yuan less than the budgeted figure.  </p>
<p>This was mainly because expenditures on debt servicing fell by 1.897 billion yuan due to fluctuations in foreign-exchange rates and because interest payments on domestic short-term government treasury bonds were 488 million yuan less than the budgeted figure, he said.</p>
