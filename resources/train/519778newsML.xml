<p>Paris St Germain's French international goalkeeper Bernard Lama was confirmed on Friday as having tested positive for cannabis and faces suspension at a critical stage in his career a year before the World Cup finals.</p>
<p>The result of the second urine sample analysed earlier this week confirmed February's positive test and Lama will be asked to appear before the French Football Federation's (FFF) doping commission within the next 10 days, the FFF's director of communications Jean-Yves Le Huede said.</p>
<p>&quot;The counter analysis demanded by Lama confirmed the presence of the product (found in the first test),&quot; Le Huede said.</p>
<p>&quot;He faces sanctions eventually but I can't say what these will be. That will be decided by the federation's doping commission,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In a previous case of a positive test for cannabis involving a top French player in October 1995, Lama's chief rival for the World Cup goalkeeper's jersey Fabien Barthez of Monaco was suspended for two months.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Lama tested positive in random testing while preparing with the France team for a friendly against the Netherlands in Febuary.</p>
<p>He was France's first choice keeper at the European championship in England last June but lost his place to Barthez through injury in October and has played one international, his 35th cap, since.</p>
<p>He was not even on the bench for the last friendly at home to Sweden on April 2, two days before news broke of his positive dope test.</p>
<p>A suspension now would most probably put Lama out of June's Tournoi de France, a four-team World Cup warm-up tournament involving holders Brazil, Italy and England and coach Aime Jacquet's major test of his team before they host the finals.</p>
<p>Lama, rated as one of the best keepers in the world last year, is also crucial to his club PSG's hopes of taking France's second European Cup berth next season and retaining the Cup Winners' Cup next month.</p>
<p>PSG travel to Liverpool next Thursday for the second leg of their semifinal tie after winning the home leg 3-0 with Lama's help last week.</p>
