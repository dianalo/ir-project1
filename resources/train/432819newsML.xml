<title>ALBANIA: Albanian unrest spreads to north-sources.</title>
<headline>Albanian unrest spreads to north-sources.</headline>
<dateline>TIRANA 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Unrest gripping Albania spread to the north of the country for the first time on Tuesday when a military barracks was looted of arms, government sources said.</p>
<p>The incident occurred in the northern town of Bajram Curri, located in area regarded as solidly behind embattled President Sali Berisha, but officials were unable to give further details.  </p>
<p>The incident occurred as armed insurgents in the south of Albania, angered by heavy losses due to the collapse of pyramid investment schemes, seized towns and arms.</p>
<p>Describing the looting of the barracks in Bajram Curri, one government official told Reuters: &quot;It is difficult for me to give more details, but it seems that people just wanted to be armed.</p>
<p>&quot;They went to the barracks and looted weapons and ammunition without meeting any resistance.&quot;</p>
<p>Bajram Curri is in the far north of Albania, close to the border with Yugoslavia's mainly Albanian-populated Kosovo region. It is geographically far removed from the southern region where the unrest began.</p>
