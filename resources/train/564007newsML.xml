<p>Kuwait's central bank governor and finance minister were both quoted on Tuesday as saying they saw no danger of an imminent crash on the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE), saying its situation was &quot;reassuring&quot;.</p>
<p>Several MPs, including parliament speaker Ahmad al-Saadoun, have warned recently of a stock market crash similar to the collapse of the unregulated Souq al-Manakh in 1982. They have also criticised the government's privatisation programme.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse's situation does not call for any fear,&quot; Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah told al-Qabas newspaper.</p>
<p>Sheikh Salem and Finance Minister Nasser al-Rodhan were both quoted by al-Qabas as saying the situation on the bourse was &quot;reassuring&quot;.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the KSE index opened about six points up at 2,314.7 following a 49 point gain the previous day. The index is some 40 points lower than on April 27 when it hit a record high, triggering the fears of a fall.</p>
<p>Sheikh Salem said the market could &quot;require the development of regulatory and dealing systems and rules governing the listing of new firms on the KSE.&quot;</p>
<p>Sixty-six firms with a market capitalisation of about $24 billion are listed on the Kuwait bourse.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Saadoun warned the government in parliament that its privatisation policies could cause an economic catastrophe and a security problem. He also charged that &quot;influential&quot; Kuwaitis were benefiting from a lack of regulations on the privatisation programme.</p>
<p>But Rodhan told al-Qabas that some 500,000 Kuwaitis had benefited from privatisation. Kuwait has a population of about 710,000 Kuwaitis and 1.25 million foreigners.</p>
<p>He said more than 1.7 billion government shares were sold since the 1994 launch of the programme -- 1.1 billion by public subscription and 600 million shares in public auctions.</p>
<p>The state has sold stakes in 22 listed and unlisted firms for 740 million dinars ($2.2 billion) in the first phase of the programme. Shares worth another one billion dinars are to be sold by the end of 1998.</p>
<p>Parliament is studying a bill approving the next stage of the programme, the more controversial privatisation of utilities, including water, electricity, transport, health services and telecommunications.</p>
