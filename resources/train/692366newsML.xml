<p>The cameras will click and proud words will be spoken on Saturday when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright lays the cornerstone of the United State's future consulate in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>Behind her, looming large, will be an imposing reminder of America's war in Vietnam and its ignominious retreat in 1975 -- the former Saigon embassy.</p>
<p>It may be derelict, its concrete crumbling and its rusting gates padlocked, but the old embassy still stands tall behind the shady trees that line Le Duan Boulevard.</p>
<p>Barbed wire still clings to the perimeter wall of this, the war's diplomatic nerve centre in Saigon, an eye-less monolith with concrete slats instead of windows on its five upper floors.</p>
<p>A tall metal flagpole stands bare in the compound and, on the roof, steps can be seen up to the helipad from where people were lifted, amid the chaos, to safety when Saigon fell to the communist north on April 30, 1975.</p>
<p>The images of that frantic day are perhaps among the most enduring of a conflict which claimed the lives of 58,000 Americans and more than three million Vietnamese.</p>
<p>U.S. marines flew helicopters for 18 hours non-stop, evacuating 5,500 men, women and children from the embassy grounds and 1,875 from the embassy roof to waiting aircraft carriers in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>&quot;Those last days were charged with atmosphere,&quot; says one American veteran now working in Hanoi. &quot;A pall of ashes rained down on the whole block and people waiting there, because marines were burning classified files.&quot;</p>
<p>But not all the files.</p>
<p>&quot;I never made it out,&quot; says a former South Vietnam soldier, who now lives in the heart of the city. &quot;They found files about me, and I was sent to a re-education camp.&quot;</p>
<p>Outside the old embassy, a granite slab was erected last year as a memorial to 17 commandos who were killed after forcing their way into the embassy grounds during the Tet Offensive of 1968.</p>
<p>Although a costly military loss for the communists, the Tet Offensive helped turn American public opinion against the war, and so the memorial serves as another reminder of defeat.</p>
<p>The two countries have gradually put aside the bitter legacy of their conflict. In 1994, President Bill Clinton lifted a long-standing embargo on trade with Vietnam and in 1995 diplomatic relations were normalised.</p>
<p>For poignancy, Albright's stone-laying ceremony -- in an empty lot -- is unlikely to match her predecessor Warren Christopher's hoisting of the flag at a new embassy in Hanoi two years ago.</p>
<p>But it will mark another step in the healing process and, more practically, it means the United States will have a consular presence in Vietnam's biggest city.</p>
<p>The United States now ranks sixth among a long list of countries with investment in Vietnam, and most U.S. businessmen live and work in Ho Chi Minh City, the powerhouse of the country's reform-led economic boom.</p>
<p>More than one million Vietnamese who left the country after 1975 now live in the United States, most of them on the west coast. Albright's gesture means that Uncle Sam will be closer to hand in Ho Chi Minh City for them and the families they left behind.</p>
