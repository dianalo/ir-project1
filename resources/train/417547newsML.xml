<p>Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez turns 70 this week, three decades after he put Colombia on the literary map with the publication of &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Friends and family members say the world's most renowned Colombian is unlikely to celebrate at home, however, since the violence-torn country he knows perhaps too well is one in which he currently refuses to live.</p>
<p>Widely considered Latin America's greatest living literary master, Garcia Marquez was born on March 6, 1927, in the small town of Aracataca, near the Caribbean coast in Colombia's northern province of Magdalena.</p>
<p>He lived through the undeclared civil war known as &quot;La Violencia,&quot; in which some 300,000 Colombians were killed between 1948 and 1957. Violence, along with the physical and moral hardships of life in rural Colombia, are central themes throughout his work.</p>
<p>A business associate quoted Garcia Marquez, who acknowledges being a great admirer of William Faulkner and is a close friend of William Styron, as having told her last month he was &quot;disgusted&quot; with his homeland and had no intention of returning to Colombia until President Ernesto Samper leaves office in August 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn't want to return. He's disgusted, scandalised by what's going on in the country and disillusioned with the government,&quot; Maria Elvira Samper, director of the QAP television news programme, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Politics may have something to do with his self-imposed exile, since he urged President Ernesto Samper to step down at the height of last year's political crisis stemming from Samper's allegedly drug-financed election campaign.</p>
<p>But research for his latest book, a non-fiction account of a string of political kidnappings carried out by Colombian drug lords as part of their fight against extradition to the United States, may also have made him overly aware of the dangers of living in a land with a double-barrelled claim to one of the world's highest kidnapping and murder rates.</p>
<p>In a statement to the RCN radio network on Feb. 19, explaining why he had abandoned his homes in Bogota and Cartagena, if only temporarily, Garcia Marquez alluded to the threat to his personal safety.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in Colombia has become uncomfortable, insecure and uneasy,&quot; he said. &quot;I left to find a place where I can do what I can do for Colombia, which is to write.&quot;</p>
<p>Margarita Marquez, Garcia Marquez's cousin and Bogota-based secretary, declined to comment on the reasons behind his latest exile from Colombia. He spends most of his time now in Mexico, but has lived abroad in Cuba and elsewhere for most of the past 40 years, and recently was reported to have attended a state dinner with President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Marquez also would not comment on plans for his birthday, saying only &quot;he's resting somewhere in solitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Garcia Marquez has described Colombia as &quot;a dense and indecipherable&quot; place in which &quot;the implausible is the only measure of reality.&quot; The same is probably true of most of Latin America, and writers like Guatemala's Miguel Angel Asturias and Cuba's Alejo Carpentier developed the genre known as &quot;magic realism&quot; before &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&quot; Garcia Marquez's first masterpiece, was published in June 1967.</p>
<p>The book is arguably Latin America's most famous work of fiction, however, and it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into 36 languages.</p>
<p>Asked about death in an interview last month with an old friend, Jose Font Castro, Garcia Marquez said: &quot;It anguishes me that it may be something permanent.&quot; He also said he would give up the Nobel Prize he won in 1982, and just about everything else, if he could only be 50 again.</p>
<p>Asked why, he said &quot;to start all over again.&quot;</p>
