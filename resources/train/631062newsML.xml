<title>FRANCE: French Socialists want Europe without austerity.</title>

<p>France's Socialist party, swept to power in parliamentary elections, pledged on Monday to make its voice heard on Europe and said everyone stood to gain if a single European currency no longer meant austerity.</p>
<p>But it sidestepped questions on whether it was willing to risk the launch of the euro in 1999 if its demands for a change in the way Europe prepares for a single currency are not met.</p>
<p>&quot;If we have fixed these conditions it is in order to negotiate,&quot; party spokesman Francois Hollande told LCI television.</p>
<p>The Socialists have called for a flexible reading of the Maastricht treaty, early membership of the euro for Italy and Spain, a European economic government and new talks on the &quot;stability pact,&quot; limiting budget deficits after 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;On all these things we will be relatively intransigent,&quot; Hollande said, saying there was no point setting conditions only to announce in advance a willingness to back down.</p>
<p>&quot;We all stand to gain if Italy and Spain are in monetary union, if there is a political government alongside the European Central Bank, if Europe no longer means austerity,&quot; Hollande told French radio earlier.</p>
<p>Hollande, speaking for the party rather than the new government which will not be named until later this week, also said the Socialists wanted assurances about the stability pact.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Lionel Jospin has said he does not feel bound by the outgoing government's accord on the pact.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to have assurances the stability pact does not signify new austerity in France,&quot; Hollande told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>The party was worried about sanctions on countries whose deficits overshot EMU criteria. &quot;We want to be sure that sanctions will not be applied if the main objectives are not reached,&quot; he said, without giving further details.</p>
<p>A German call for fines on budget overspenders was the most controversial element in the pact, agreed by France last year only after it secured a compromise deal that politicians could decide when such sanctions apply.</p>
<p>Hollande nonetheless confirmed the party planned an early audit of public finances -- within two weeks -- to see where France stood on Maastricht criteria limiting budget deficits to three percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>&quot;We will make savings everywhere where it is necessary and if we have any effort to make, we will not ask for it from French people with most modest means,&quot; he told French radio.</p>
<p>Financial markets saw the audit as a sign the Socialists were looking for an excuse not to implement immediately what might be costly campaign pledges.</p>
<p>&quot;The audit is important. It leaves the door open for backing off from rapid implementation of their programme,&quot; Merrill Lynch bond market analyst Joanne Perez said.</p>
<p>Economists believe while the new government will not follow the rigid stand of the outgoing administration, which aimed to reduce the budget deficit to precisely 3.0 percent of gross domestic product, it will limit it to somewhere near three.</p>
<p>Giving the Socialist-led government the benefit of the doubt for now, markets held their fire on Monday after initially marking down stocks, bonds and the franc.</p>
<p>All French investments ended higher as analysts judged the possible presence of the Communist party in the new government would not signficantly alter policies.</p>
<p>Earlier the Communists, who hold the balance of power in parliament, repeated a call for a relaxation of Maastricht.</p>
<p>Pierre Zarka, a member of the Communist Party leadership, said it wanted &quot;to relax the Maastricht grip...and free ourselves from criteria that are absolutely tragic for the population and the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jospin, named prime minister on Monday, has said his party's line on Europe would prevail in any Socialist-led government.</p>
<p>The Communist Party had called for a new referendum on a single currency.</p>
