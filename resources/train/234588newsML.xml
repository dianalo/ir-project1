<p>Swedish economic reseach institute KI said on Wednesday it saw Swedish gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.7 percent in 1997 against an estimated 1.5 percent in 1996 and 2.4 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>In its final quarterly report for the year, KI also forecast the Swedish consumer price index rising 1.0 percent in 1997 against an estimated rise of 0.8 percent in 1996 but rising 2.2 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>In August, at the time of the last KI quarterly forecast, the institute said it expected the consumer price index to rise 1.2 percent year-on-year in 1996 and 1.8 percent in 1997. It forecast GDP at 1.5 percent for 1996 and 2.2 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>This is the first time KI has given forecasts for 1998.</p>
<p>KI said the economic situation in Sweden had improved.</p>
<p>&quot;Signs of increased optimism have emerged from among households and companies lately,&quot; KI said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said it had revised its GDP forecast for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The boost in GDP from exports is counterbalanced by public consumption and the fact that fixed gross investments are growing slower than expected,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The domestic economy was also having a positive effect.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation with clearly lower debt yields and a stronger crown implies that the forces behind growth are coming more and more from domestic sectors of the economy,&quot; KI said.</p>
<p>KI said risks for low growth in the Swedish economy were linked to developments with the &quot;process&quot; of the European Union's monetary union and its effect on money markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncertainty and turbulence regarding this can arise from the developments in Europe in general as well as the process specfic to Sweden,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>KI said it expected public finance to continue to improve, forecasting the public sector deficit to fall to three percent of GDP this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Next year we estimate the public finance deficit to be 1.5 to 2.0 percent of of GDP and be eliminated for the most part in 1998,&quot; KI said.</p>
<p>This was more optimistic than the government's forecast which said the public sector deficit would fall below three percent in 1997.</p>
