<title>USA: Flood of new US corporate bonds makes market waves.</title>
<headline>Flood of new US corporate bonds makes market waves.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-24</dateline>

<p>Investors swallowed close to $3 billion in new U.S. corporate bonds on Thursday, setting off a ripple effect of trading activity across the various sectors of the secondary market, market players said.</p>
<p>Investor uncertainty about the future direction of interest rates and corporate bond spreads, caused some new deals to price at wider spread levels than paper in the secondary market, market players said.</p>
<p>Banc One Corp's $900 million debt offering of 10-year and 30-year bonds had a lukewarm reception by investors and priced wide of secondary market levels, market source said.  </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co Inc, the underwriter for the $500 million 30-year tranche, was forced to hike price talk from original levels due to poor investor interest.</p>
<p>Market players said investors were uneasy about buying such a large amount of long-term bank paper in an environment where rising rates could erode future bank profits.</p>
<p>Following the adjustment, investors swapped their current holdings of bank debt in order to obtain the new supply of higher-yielding securities. The selling pressure caused spreads on secondary market bank paper to widen by several basis points, market sources said.  </p>
<p>The Banc One's A1/A-plus-rated, $400 million 10-year notes and $500 million 30-year debentures priced to yield 7.63 percent and 8.12 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>But an even larger four-tranche offering from Comcast Cable Communications Inc met with an enthusiastic reception from investors on Thursday.</p>
<p>The issuer, the cable unit of Comcast Inc, increased the size of the offering to $1.7 billion from an original amount of $1 billion due to strong investor demand.</p>
<p>Traders said the BA1/BBB-minus-rated issue priced inside levels for comparable debt from rival Tele-Communications Inc.  </p>
<p>But the success of the Comcast offering overflowed to the secondary market, causing spreads on outstanding TCI bonds to tighten five basis points to seven basis points across the board, traders said.</p>
<p>Comcast priced $300 million in seven-year debt, $600 million in 10-year debt, $550 million in 20-year debt and $250 million in 30-year debt putable in 12-years, to yield 8.142 percent, 8.473 percent, 8.965 percent and 8.523 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Yankee bond issuers met with similarly mixed-fates on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Tenaga Nasional Berhad, a Malaysian power company, increased the size of its debut Yankee bond offering to $800 million from $500 million.</p>
<p>The issuer sold $500 million in 10-year notes to yield 7.647 percent and $300 million in 10-year notes, putable in five years, to yield 7.234 percent via UBS Securities and Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>But investor concerns about economic and political instability in Korea put a damper on the first Yankee offering from Korean wireless telephone provider, SK Telecom Co Ltd.</p>
