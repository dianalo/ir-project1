<title>GERMANY: Bund futures seen in ranges after Friday decline.</title>
<headline>Bund futures seen in ranges after Friday decline.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bund futures were expected to continue trading in dull ranges early next week after spending much of Friday drifting at lower levels.</p>
<p>A slew of U.S. economic indicators that some had hoped could send Bunds higher failed to have much lasting impact on debt markets and traders were content to end the week with what have been good gains.</p>
<p>With the U.S. data out of the way, the market's focus is now turning back to Germany where M3 money supply data are due as early as Monday and where the closely watched Ifo business climate report is expected on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Just before the close, the DTB Bund future was down 27 basis points at 101.33.</p>
<p>The Bund/T-note spread held at near historic levels again, slipping a single basis point to 91.</p>
<p>That spread could widen toward 100 next week if the German data reinforce the view that the economy is growing slowly.</p>
<p>Bunds showed little reaction to comments from Bundesbank council member Franz-Christoph Zeitler who said Germany is not on the verge of a change in the interest rate cycle and that the price climate should remain calm in 1997.  </p>
<p>Traders said that if the data shows subdued economic growth, the contract appears technically positioned to move toward the 101.80 level.</p>
<p>But the real target is the 102.07 mark, a high dating back to early December. Traders said that if that level could be reached, Bunds would be well-positioned for yet further gains.</p>
