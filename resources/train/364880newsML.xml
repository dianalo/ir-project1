<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday all female Palestinian prisoners held by Israel would be freed next week, fulfilling a commitment made in an interim peace deal with the PLO, Israel Radio said.</p>
<p>It said Netanyahu made the statement at the weekly cabinet meeting. Israeli officials were not immediately available to comment.  </p>
<p>Netanyahu's office later released a cabinet statement confirming an order had been given to release the woman prisoners but giving no date for the release. Only 25 of the 5,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel are women.</p>
<p>The radio said President Ezer Weizman had to pardon several of the prisoners before they could be freed and that process would hold up the release until next week. Weizman had previously refused to pardon some of the prisoners.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister reported to the government ministers that an order was given to free the Palestinian female prisoners,&quot; the cabinet statement said. It said Weizman had now decided to pardon all the female prisoners.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who ousted Israel's previous government in elections last May, has said he will honour all commitments signed by that government. The prisoner release is one of those commitments.</p>
