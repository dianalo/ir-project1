<headline>Dollar drifts higher as future direction unclear.</headline>

<p>The dollar floated higher Friday, failing to make a significant comeback from Thursday's sharp slide and calling into question the sustainability of the dollar's rise in recent months.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people are still long- or medium-term dollar bulls, but I am hearing more and more disappointment in the inability of the dollar to move higher,&quot; said Robert Fullem, an assistant vice president at NatWest Markets in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar has risen more than 10 percent against the German mark and almost 8 percent vs. the Japanese yen since the beginning of this year. However, the dollar's shine was tarnished this week by signs of embryonic growth in Europe and Japan and repeated calls from German officials for an end to the U.S. currency's spirited rally.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 1.6890 marks from 1.6863 at Thursday's close and 123.27 yen from 122.55.</p>
<p>Aiding the dollar Friday was weakness in the Japanese yen, reflecting market concern over Chinese President Jiang Zemin's ability to hold on to power.</p>
<p>Speaking publically for the first time since the report of the death of supreme leader Deng Ziaoping, Jiang vowed Friday to push forward reforms that his mentor launched 18 years ago. Some diplomats said Jiang may soon be embroiled in a power struggle with other contenders in the highest echelons of the ruling Communist party.</p>
<p>The dollar briefly dipped against the mark following a remark by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which mimicked an oft-stated refrain of German central bankers, that the mark has &quot;fully corrected against the dollar in the last year&quot;.</p>
<p>The unity in opposition to a stronger dollar between the German government and the Bundesbank briefly weighed on the dollar. However, Kohl's comments were soon discounted.</p>
<p>&quot;The knee-jerk reaction was to sell dollars and buy marks, but people soon came to the conclusion that Kohl really has no function as far as determining the level of the mark,&quot; said Bob Houck, a vice president and trader at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Comments from Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke and Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin caught the market's attention but had little impact on dollar trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>Welteke said Germany was unlikely to meet the budget deficit target required for entry into the union for a single European currency. Nevertheless, he added that Germany would participate at the proposed 1999 currency launch date.</p>
<p>Rivlin said a strong dollar &quot;certainly helps&quot; curb inflation, but could hurt U.S. exporters.</p>
<p>In late U.S. trade, dollar traders took little notice of news U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had reaffirmed his familiar stance that a &quot;strong dollar is in the United State's interest and it has been strong for some time now.&quot;</p>
<p>The Rubin comment was in a statement released along with a semiannual Treasury report on foreign exchange prepared for Congress.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.4717 Swiss francs from 1.4767 and rose to Canadian $1.3643 from C$1.3623. The British pound rose to $1.6190 from $1.6125.</p>
