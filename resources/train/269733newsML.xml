<headline>N.Carolina jury finds ABC guilty in Food Lion case. [CORRECTED 10:00 GMT 21/12]</headline>

<p>A federal jury returned a verdict finding journalists employed by Walt Disney Co's ABC television network committed trespassing and fraud in preparing an undercover news report about alleged unsanitary food practices by grocery store chain Food Lion Inc.</p>
<p>(Corrects throughout to read that journalists were found to have committed trespassing and fraud, not &quot;were found guilty of trespassing and fraud&quot;.)</p>
<p>The jury announced its finding after more than six hours of deliberations that began on Thursday afternoon and ended shortly after 2 p.m. EST on Friday.  </p>
<p>A court clerk read the verdict that found two field producers and two executive producers of ABC-TV committed the offenses while preparing the show about Food Lion for broadcast on Nov. 5, 1992.</p>
<p>In addition to finding that four ABC producers committed trespassing and fraud, the jury also decided that the two field producers who went undercover to obtain information about sanitary practices of the chain were disloyal to their employer, Food Lion.  </p>
<p>And the panel also found that ABC network was liable because corporate lawyer Jonathan Barzilay (corrects from Zaylizay) reviewed the Food Lion story before it was broadcast.</p>
<p>Food Lion, based in Salisbury, North Carolina, sued ABC and four of its producers and is seeking $1.7 billion in damages from ABC to recoup losses from an expose the network aired on its &quot;PrimeTime Live&quot; show.</p>
<p>Food Lion, the U.S. unit of Belgian retailer Ets Delhaize Freres et Cie 'LE LION' SA, claims it lost $1.5 billion in stock value at the time of the Nov. 5, 1992 broadcast, and $233 million in profits after the broadcast.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict only on the charges and did not decide how much in damages to award to Food Lion. The panel is expected to take up the issue of damages after the Christmas holiday.</p>
