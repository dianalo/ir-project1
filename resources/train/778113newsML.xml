<p>Lawyers for NBA Rookie of the Year Allen Iverson said Tuesday he will plead innocent to drug possession and weapons charges and will not say anything more until his appearance in court next week.</p>
<p>The electric point guard of the Philadelphia 76ers, who was arrested Sunday morning, has the Virginia Beach, Virginia, law firm which represented Iverson following a bowling alley brawl four years ago. The firm released a statement regarding their client.</p>
<p>&quot;On August 3, 1997, Allen Iverson did not commit any drug or firearm offence,&quot; a portion of the statement read. &quot;He looks forward to his day in court when all of the facts will be fully presented.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Iverson will plead not guilty to all charges.  Mr. Iverson will not make any public statement prior to trial.&quot;</p>
<p>Iverson is scheduled to be arraigned August 12th. He is charged with misdemeanor possession of less than one-half ounce of marijuana and possession of a weapon while in possession of a controlled substance.</p>
<p>Iverson allegedly was a passenger in his own Mercedes, which was clocked at 93 miles (149.7 km) per hour in a 65 miles (104.6 km) an hour zone on Interstate 64 in Talleysville, about 20 miles east of Richmond.</p>
<p>Trooper Michael Pierce said when he stopped the vehicle, he smelled marijuana. Iverson, 22, was charged with marijuana possession. Iverson also was hit with the weapons charge after a .45-calibre handgun was found on the front floorboard of the car.</p>
<p>Iverson, who admitted earlier this year that he carries a gun in his car, claimed the weapon was his. Because the marijuana recovered was less than the one pound required to trigger the charge, the weapons infraction likely will be dropped.</p>
<p>Driver Maduro Earl Hill was charged with reckless driving and passenger Damon Stewart was charged with marijuana possession. All three men are from Hampton, Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Iverson would like to express to his fans and especially his young fans that he is very thankful for their support and would never intentionally do anything to disappoint them,&quot; the statement said.  &quot;He regrets that he allowed himself to be in a situation that reflects poorly on his judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>Although the gun charge likely will be dropped and the NBA's substance abuse policy does not have a provision for marijuana, 76ers owner Pat Croce still was upset with Iverson's behaviour.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if it's not his pot, he is in the wrong environment,&quot; Croce said Monday. &quot;It's an error in judgment. When you make a mistake with who you hang around, it will go right to him first because he is in the public spotlight.&quot;</p>
<p>Iverson was the top overall pick in the 1996 draft.</p>
<p>As a high school student in 1993, Iverson was convicted of three counts of maiming by mob in connection with a chair-throwing incident at a Hampton bowling alley.</p>
<p>Iverson was sentenced to five years in prison and served almost four months before the Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the conviction and then-Governor Douglas Wilder granted him clemency, allowing him to enroll at Georgetown University.</p>
