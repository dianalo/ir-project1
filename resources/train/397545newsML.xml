<p>The Czech Republic said on Monday it was opposed to big powers deciding on NATO enlargement and the alliance's relations with Russia without input from smaller countries.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told a news conference a French-proposed summit of the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Russia would not be the right forum in which to decide on plans to expand NATO eastwards.</p>
<p>&quot;For us it is clear that a conference of superpowers would not be the right solution,&quot; Zieleniec told reporters.</p>
<p>The United States has also reacted coolly to the idea.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's alliance is composed of a variety of countries large and small, and custom has shown clearly that decision-making on Europe's fate, where all take part, is the best and favours stability,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>Zieleniec said he was sure the Czech Republic would be in the first wave of countries asked to join NATO after the alliance's Madrid summit in July and that enlargement would happen by April 1999, when the alliance celebrates its 50th birthday.</p>
<p>Asked whether he was concerned over Russia's strong opposition to NATO enlargement, the minister said he was confident that Czech relations with Russia could improve.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a feeling that the Czech Republic entering the alliance will help these relations (with Russia) but it will allow both sides clearly to define our positions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said any accord between NATO and Russia should be a &quot;declaration of a political will&quot; rather than a formal treaty.</p>
<p>Zieleniec said he was against holding a referendum on Czech membership of NATO, saying none of the 16 current members had held one before joining the organisation.</p>
<p>The main Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, supports NATO entry but demands a referendum.</p>
<p>Zieleniec played down recent public opinion polls showing that only 37 percent of Czechs support membership, saying support would increase as debate on the issue picked up.</p>
<p>A poll by the state-run IVVM agency released on Monday showed that 56 percent of Czechs believed NATO membership would bring the best possible security solution for the country.</p>
