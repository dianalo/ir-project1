<headline>YEAREND - Johnson triumph climax of sporting year.</headline>

<p>Four years of planning, preparation and pressure culminated in 19.32 seconds of explosive sprinting on a hot August night this year, transforming the face of the Atlanta Olympics and the life of Michael Johnson.</p>
<p>An unhappy Games, marred by relentless commercialism, persistent transport and technology problems and a fatal bomb attack in the heart of the city, was saved ultimately by Johnson and his fellow athletes.</p>
<p>After a year of lobbying to persuade the authorities to change the Olympic timetable, Johnson completed the first men's Olympic 200-400 metres double.</p>
<p>In the 200, Johnson survived a slight stumble at the start to send his own world record spinning into another dimension.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished, Johnson released a mighty roar of exultation and relief as his time flashed on to the scoreboard and southern rock 'n' roll reverberated through the stadium.</p>
<p>Donovan Bailey broke the world record in the 100 metres final and anchored the Canadian 4x100 team to a hugely satisfying victory over the Americans, while Carl Lewis can justifiably claim to be the greatest Olympian ever with his fourth consecutive long jump title for an overall tally of nine gold medals.</p>
<p>SWIMMING</p>
<p>Four world records fell in the pool where Ireland's Michelle Smith won three gold medals, Hungarian Krisztina Egerszegi won a third successive 200 metres backstroke title and Alexander Popov and Kieran Perkins confirmed their status as the outstanding freestyle exponents of their era.</p>
<p>BOXING</p>
<p>In the birthplace of black civil rights leader Martin Luther King, the Olympic torch was lit with shaking hand by the most famous black athlete of all, Muhammad Ali, now stricken with Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>The flame had been carried in to the stadium by another black heavyweight boxer whose best days appeared well behind him.</p>
<p>Evander Holyfield, a 34-year-old Atlanta native, went on to produce the upset of the year by stopping the formidable Mike Tyson on an electric night in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Holyfield started a 22-1 underdog in the World Boxing Association title fight against the brooding menace of the 30-year-old Tyson, beaten only once before in his professional career.</p>
<p>But from the first round it was clear that somebody was prepared to trade punches with Tyson for the first time since his release from prison on a rape charge.</p>
<p>In round six Tyson, already in trouble, walked into a left hook which sent him tumbling to the canvas. He was desperately fortunate to survive round 10 and seconds into the 11th referee Mitch Halpern had seen enough and stopped the fight.</p>
<p>The only person not taken by surprise was Holyfield, who had told a disbelieving world exactly what he intended to do.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to go in there and wipe Tyson out,&quot; Holyfield predicted. &quot;This is what the Lord has in store for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyson, unexpectedly gracious in defeat, was the top earning athlete in 1996, amassing $75 million from his three fights for less than 50 minutes work.</p>
<p>CYCLING AND TENNIS</p>
<p>Miguel Indurain, who had celebrated his birthday each July for five years en route to winning the Tour de France, lost out this time to Dane Bjarne Riis but won gold for Spain in Atlanta in the time trial.</p>
<p>Steffi Graf and Pete Sampras both survived personal traumas to consolidate their status as undisputed world number ones on the tennis court with wins in the U.S. Open, final grand slam event of the year.</p>
<p>Graf, troubled by persistent injuries, is not the irresistible force of yesteryear. But her competitive steel shone through in a year in which her overwhelming concern remained the fate of her father, released on bail last month after 15 months in prison on charges of evading tax on his daughter's earnings.</p>
<p>Sampras, meanwhile, had spent the year struggling to come to terms with the death of his coach Tim Gullikson from brain cancer in May at the age of 44.</p>
<p>The tennis year ended on a dramatic note when France defeated Sweden 3-2 in the Davis Cup final, the first final ever to be decided in the fifth set of the fifth rubber.</p>
<p>The tie also featured the last appearance of Sweden's Stefan Edberg, a peerless serve-and-volley exponent and a fine advertisement for his sport.</p>
<p>GOLF</p>
<p>The highlight of the golfing year came in the final round of the U.S. Masters in Augusta as Nick Faldo stalked Greg Norman with the cold-eyed intensity of a hired assassin.</p>
<p>Norman held a seemingly impregnable six-stroke lead on the final day, only to fall apart technically and mentally in a day of personal anguish and lose eventually by a staggering five strokes.</p>
<p>The scene was set for similar dramatics at the British Open at Royal Lytham when Faldo trailed American Tom Lehman by the same margin at the start of the final round.</p>
<p>On this occasion Lehman, a tough professional who did not win his tour card until 1992, held on and remarked later: &quot;It wasn't pretty but it was gritty.&quot;</p>
<p>MOTOR RACING</p>
<p>Four years after joining the elite Damon Hill, son of a famous father, silenced his doubters by winning the Formula One drivers' title in the final race of the season at Suzuka, Japan.</p>
<p>Hill, eschewing the off-track flamboyance of his father Graham, champion in 1962 and 1968, wrapped up the title when his nearest rival and Williams team mate Jacques Villeneuve quit with 15 laps to go.</p>
<p>Despite Hill's record of eight wins in 16 races, team boss Frank Williams decided to dispense with his services during the season and the 36-year-old Briton will defend the world title with the Arrows team next year.</p>
<p>FOOTBALL, CRICKET AND RACING</p>
<p>Germany won Euro 96, the European soccer championship, with a 2-1 win over the Czech Republic, the dubious honour of scoring the first sudden-death goal in a global tournament going to Oliver Bierhoff, who had earlier scored the equaliser.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka tilted the cricketing world on its axis by winning the cricket World Cup with innovative tactics which featured a run charge in the opening overs as the game's powerbase continued to shift to the Indian sub-continent.</p>
<p>And in the first year of professional rugby union, New Zealand beat Australia and South Africa to win the first Tri-Nations tournament and for good measure won their first series ever in South Africa.</p>
<p>The most cheering news of the year for the average punter came on a crisp autumn day at Ascot, England, where Frankie Dettori rode seven winners in seven rides at odds of 25,095 to one.</p>
<p>One shattered bookmaker commented: &quot;The fifth winner was expensive, the sixth dismal and after the seventh it was time to put the lights out.&quot;</p>
