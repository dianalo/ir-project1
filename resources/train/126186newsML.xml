<title>UK: Lead prices are hit in a new commodity shake-out.</title>
<headline>Lead prices are hit in a new commodity shake-out.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lead prices tumbled towards their lowest levels of the year on Friday in a sell-off that reflected big deliveries from China. Traders said there were also signs that demand was weak. Western motorists were not rushing to renew lead-acid car batteries unless they had to, because they were deterred by high garage forecourt prices.</p>
<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) three-months delivery lead fell as low as $715 per tonne, its lowest since the end of January.</p>
<p>Last trade in London's afternoon was a touch firmer at $719 but traders said a test of $700 is likely.</p>
<p>Elsewhere among the industrial metals, copper firmed on news of a big drop of 19,125 tonnes in warehouse stocks but stayed within a recent range around $1,950 per tonne.</p>
<p>Gold closed in London at $380.15 after $380.45 on Thursday and was considered vulnerable after fresh speculator sales in the precious metals sector. Palladium fixed at a 3-1/2 year low of $115.25 per ounce.</p>
<p>But oil prices were again firm on strong pre-winter demand for heating fuel in the northern hemisphere. Benchmark Brent Blend crude oil futures were up by about 25 cents on the day around $24.45 in London's late afternoon.</p>
<p>Coffee prices fell with January Robusta type futures down $27 per tonne to end the week at $1,397 on selling by producer nations and by investment funds.</p>
<p>Cocoa futures also ignored news of a big U.S. grind, an indication of demand, to ease 14 pounds sterling to 986 sterling by the London close. Supply is seen building soon.</p>
<p>Selling of sugar began in New York and moved to London where the nearby white sugar futures contract dropped as low as $316.00 per tonne, down from $319 on Thursday, before making some recovery.</p>
<p>The London-based International Sugar Organization (ISO) predicted in a report that prices were likely to drift down under a 1996/97 surplus of 2.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The ISO said that this would offset other factors &quot;so that the world market enters a period of lower prices...&quot; Following are some key commodity prices at 1630 GMT</p>
