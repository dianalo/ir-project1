<p>Aslan Maskhadov, the guerrilla leader who wants Russia and the world to recognise Chechen independence, looked poised on Wednesday for a convincing win in his country's presidential election.</p>
<p>His spokesman Mayerbek Vachagayev told reporters that preliminary results from 53 of the mountainous region's 63 electoral districts gave Maskhadov nearly 65 percent of the vote, well ahead of his nearest rival Shamil Basayev.</p>
<p>Vachagayev said Basayev, a hardline rebel regarded in Moscow as a terrorist, had won 24 percent of the vote and acting president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev had won 10 percent.</p>
<p>A Central Election Commission official declined to comment on the results as the count was still underway.</p>
<p>In Moscow Kremlin press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Itar-Tass news agency Moscow had no grounds to question the legitimacy of Monday's election but he reiterated Russian opposition to Chechen independence.</p>
<p>Maskhadov, a former Soviet artillery colonel, has already claimed victory and has made clear that he will not row back from his calls for international recognition of Chechnya.</p>
<p>&quot;We determined in 1991 that Chechnya was an independent state,&quot; said the gently spoken Maskhadov on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;All that remains is for other countries, including Russia, to recognise that. This can be achieved by political means,&quot; he said, calling on Moscow to ignore a five-year moratorium agreed in last year's peace deal and start negotiating sovereignty now.</p>
<p>In comments carried by Interfax news agency on Wednesday he took an even harder line.</p>
<p>&quot;Many consider that I am a man of compromise, that I am ready for any negotiations with Russia...But this is not so,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying. &quot;The West will not open its doors to us straight away but we will win in this affair with the same courage that won us the war.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday President Boris Yeltsin welcomed the initial poll returns, saying they gave a good chance for further peace talks. Maskhadov is regarded in Moscow as a moderate pragmatist, despite his secessionist rhetoric.</p>
<p>Yeltsin sent troops into the southern region in December 1994 to crush its secessionist bid. Tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, died during 21 months of fighting that ended with a peace deal last August.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Russia's former security chief Alexander Lebed, who signed the peace accord for Moscow, told Ekho Moskvy radio Maskhadov would conduct a &quot;sensible, balanced policy&quot;, adding: &quot;I have never had grounds to doubt Maskhadov's worthiness.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia also believes it still holds many strong cards, and may in many ways be in a better bargaining position now it has pulled its troops out of the unwinnable war on Chechnya's soil.</p>
<p>As Maskhadov himself admitted on Tuesday: &quot;Our economic situation is woeful...nearly everything has been destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>The silver-haired commander demanded reparations from Russia and said he planned to negotiate a share of revenues from lucrative Russian oil pipelines that cross Chechen territory.</p>
<p>Moscow has promised cash for reconstruction. Analysts say one of its main negotiators, businessman and deputy Security Council secretary Boris Berezovsky, has played the &quot;oil card&quot; heavily, offering a share of profits to persuade the Chechens to stay inside Russia.</p>
<p>Chechnya, surrounded on three sides by the Russian Federation and with its back to the soaring Caucasus mountains, may find it hard to win real support, even in the Moslem world, in view of Moscow's threat to retaliate by severing ties with any country that acknowledges Chechen sovereignty.</p>
