<p>Swissotel, the hotel division of the Swissair AG group, made a net profit in 1996 and plans to significantly expand its activities during the next years, its managing director Andreas Meinhold said.</p>
<p>Meinhold said in an interview with Swissair's internal magazine News that Swissotel planned to manage more than 20 hotels by the end of 1997 up from the current 16.</p>
<p>&quot;By year 2000 we want to have management agreements for 60 hotels in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the U.S., of which 10 should be in the most important Asian cities,&quot; Meinhold said.</p>
<p>He added Swissotel would reach this goal through a strategic alliance, for example with a medium-sized partner that has 30 to 40 hotels.</p>
<p>The magazine also said that Swissotel for the first time made a net profit in 1996, but gave no figures.</p>
<p>In 1995 Swissotel reported an operating profit of 22 million francs, but it did not release net results.</p>
<p>However, Swissair has often been concerned about its hotel activities and Meinhold noted that it had been hard to convince group management that Swissotel had a future in light of the lack of past success.</p>
<p>Meinhold, who only just took over Swissotels late in 1995, said the Swissotel brand name was much stronger than originally thought, especially in Asia and Middle East. This was also partially due to the connection with the Swissair name.</p>
<p>He noted that a substantial change in the corporate culture of Swissotel had taken place over the last two years and now management primarily thinks as business people.</p>
