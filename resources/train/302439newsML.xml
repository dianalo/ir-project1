<p>Canadian 88 Energy Corp. said on Monday it would launch a C$652 million ($476 million) cash and stock takeover offer for the much larger Morrison Petroleums Ltd., in a move seen attracting rival bids.</p>
<p>Calgary-based Canadian 88 said it would offer C$10 ($7.30) cash, to up to C$140 million ($102 million), or 1.5 Canadian 88 common shares, for each share of Morrison, also of Calgary.</p>
<p>The deal would propel Canadian 88 into Canada's senior producer ranks with a market capitalization of more than C$1.2 billion ($876 million) and 1997 cash flow topping C$170 million ($124 million).</p>
<p>Morrison posted 1995 revenues of C$141 million ($103 million), dwarfing Canadian 88's sales of C$29.1 million ($21.2 million).</p>
<p>Speculation arose after Canadian 88's announcement of several possible rival bidders for Morrison and even a possible reverse takeover of Canadian 88 by Morrison.</p>
<p>Both companies have extensive positions in the foothills of southwestern Alberta, seen as one of North America's most prolific natural gas exploration plays.</p>
<p>But where Canadian 88 reported a major discovery in the region last year, Morrison's much-watched Racehorse Creek well yielded disappointing results, followed by a large selloff in the company's stock.</p>
<p>Analysts said other firms with foothills gas operations that might be interested in Morrison's 123,000 net acres in the region included Norcen Energy Resources Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd., Rigel Energy Corp., Talisman Energy Inc. and Alberta Energy Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Executives at Norcen and Shell Canada said on Monday they were not considering playing the white knight for Morrison.</p>
<p>Canadian 88 Chief Executive Greg Noval, known for his aggressive business style, said the deal would mean big benefits for the two companies' shareholders.</p>
<p>The Canadian 88 offer was conditional on Morrison's just- announced shareholder rights plan, which gave the board more time to consider the bid and seek richer offers, being rendered ineffective.</p>
<p>Noval said that he would not raise the bid if a higher rival offer emerged. &quot;We're here for 21 days from mailing at 10 bucks a share and that's as far as we're going to go. We're not going to get into a public auction process.&quot;</p>
<p>Morrison said on Friday it would soon be flush with C$180 million ($131 million) in cash after the creation of a royalty trust based on cash flow from an Alberta natural gas plant and a British Columbia oil pipeline.</p>
<p>Those proceeds, in a addition to about C$60 million ($44 million) in previous asset sales, would leave Morrison with virtually no debt.</p>
<p>Rob Robinson, analyst with brokerage ScotiaMcleod Inc., said Morrison's new-found financial strength could lead to a possible reverse takeover of Canadian 88.</p>
<p>&quot;I can just speculate, but I wouldn't be too surprised if we see a bid for Canadian 88. It's called a 'Pac Man,'&quot; Robinson said. &quot;This is speculation on my part, but I would put it in the context of if I were (Morrison Chairman Gordon Stollery), I'd take a shot at Canadian 88.&quot;</p>
<p>Morrison Vice-President Paul Charron said he would not comment on the proposed deal until his firm received a formal offer and its board met to discuss it.</p>
<p>Morrison stock, the most active issue in Toronto on Monday, closed up C$1.45 at C$9.95 on volume of 14.8 million shares. Canadian 88 ended the day down C30 cents at C$6.45.</p>
