<p>The outlook for Singapore shares was shaky on Tuesday despite strengthening sentiment in the market, a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market feels more bullish. We're just not seeing any more money yet,&quot; said one dealer with an international firm.</p>
<p>Singapore shares ended Monday slightly weaker with the Straits Times Industrials Index down 5.95 at 1,975.01.</p>
<p>Concerns over regional currencies and lingering uncertainty about the recovery beginning in the Singapore economy were holding investors back, the dealer said, but another record high Wall Street on Monday was seen having some positive influence.  </p>
<p>Singapore technology stocks could see more action.</p>
<p>Trade is due to resume in Creative Technology shares this afternoon following a suspension to announce annual results.</p>
<p>The results, announced overnight in the U.S., showed Creative posting net profit of US$167.0 million in the year to June 30, 1997 against a loss of US$37.6 million previously.</p>
<p>Creative had ended down Singapore $0.60 at S$33.90 on Monday.</p>
