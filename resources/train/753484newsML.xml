<p>Algeria's feared Armed Islamic Group (GIA) chief Antar Zouabri has been killed in an ambush by security forces, sources close to the security services said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;He was killed last Tuesday with other members of the armed group,&quot; one of the sources said, adding that he died in a tunnel in Attatba region, between Tipaza and Blida, south of Algiers.  </p>
<p>Algerian newspapers have reported a major military operation in the area and said that up to 140 guerrillas had been killed since earlier this month.</p>
<p>Zouabri, 27, is at least the eighth GIA chief to have been killed since December 1992 when the group issued its first communiqu. One of its leaders, Mansouri Meliani, was executed by firing squad in 1993.</p>
<p>There has been no official confirmation of the operation against the guerrillas.</p>
