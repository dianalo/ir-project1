<p>China's metals markets were moribund as London Metal Exchange (LME) prices firmed and domestic demand remained comatose in the pre-Chinese Lunar New Year season, metals traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Copper concentrate enquiries were very thin, industry sources said, particularly as prices were strengthening.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually demand is very slow,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Metals sources noted that Chinese interest hovered at $2,100 per tonne. On Friday, LME copper prices ended at $2,255/2,260 per tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no spot enquiries at all,&quot; said a copper cathodes trader, noting that even if he offered customers flat LME prices they were not interested.</p>
<p>&quot;After the import taxes and value-added taxes, which add up to about 20.5 percent, nobody can (import),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But a metals dealer said the copper consumption season would resume in March or April, after the Lunar New Year season.</p>
<p>Aluminium import demand had also slowed as prices inched back over the $1,600 per tonne level at the LME on Friday, putting off Chinese buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>Interest would revive between $1,500 and $1,600 per tonne, sources said.</p>
<p>The Yunnan OrienMet Copper Co Ltd, a joint venture smelter, was seeking good delivery bar status and had applied for registration with the LME board, a senior trader told Reuters.</p>
<p>A decision was still pending and would be influenced by test results conducted by electric wire producers, he said.</p>
<p>Work on the Changzhou Jinyuan Copper Co Ltd, which aims to produce 100,000 tonnes of copper wire rods annually, is proceeding on schedule and will start trials by the middle of 1997, a senior Hong Kong-based trader familiar with the project told Reuters.</p>
<p>He did not give any further details.</p>
<p>China's largest non-ferrous metals trading firm, Oriental Metals (Holdings) Co Ltd, has a 62.5 percent interest in the Changzhou Jinyuan Copper Co Ltd.</p>
<p>China produced 909,700 tonnes of copper in 1996, up 5.71 percent from 1995, the State Statistical Bureau said on Monday. Copper output in December alone was 85,300 tonnes, the bureau said, but did not give further details.</p>
<p>The latest Hong Kong indications of premium or discount in US$/tonne over LME cash prices on a CIF basis remained unchanged from last week:</p>
