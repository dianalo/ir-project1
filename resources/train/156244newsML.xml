<title>SOUTH AFRICA: South Africa Ramaphosa to be Johnnic chairman.</title>

<p>Cyril Ramaphosa, chief negotiator of a black consortium which this month won control of Johnnies Industrial Corp Ltd (Johnnic), will be appointed chairman of Johnnic, Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd said on Thursday.</p>
<p>He is to replace present chairman Pat Retief who will retire from the board at the next annual general meeting in November, Anglo said in a statement.</p>
<p>Anglo said the National Empowerment Consortium's (NEC) purchase of a 35 percent stake in Johnnic for 2.656 billion rand was effected on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;As the NEC has acquired 35 per cent in Johnnic, the voting pool envisaged with Anglo (in the event that the NEC acquired less than 35 per cent) will no longer be required,&quot; it said, adding that Anglo would however retain its minority protection rights.</p>
<p>The NEC had an option for four months to acquire a further 9.1 million Johnnic shares, representing six per cent of Johnnic's issued share capital, for retail offering.</p>
<p>Anglo said the retail offering would be made to smaller NEC members and other persons within the black community at a price of 50 rand a share.</p>
<p>&quot;Designated financiers will be sought to finance participants in the retail offering, and it is anticipated that any financing scheme will involve an initial deposit with the balance outstanding plus finance charges being settled within three years,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>In order to protect participants should there be insufficient growth in the future price of Johnnic shares to settle the outstanding balance at the end of the financing period, they would have an option to put their Johnnic shares to Anglo.</p>
<p>The NEC had a right of first refusal for a period of five years in respect of Johnnic shares not taken up in the retail offering, together with a further 9.7 million shares (representing 6.4 percent), being the balance of Johnnic shares held by Anglo and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd, Anglo said.</p>
