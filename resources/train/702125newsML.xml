<title>USA: Gunman gone as police storm Navy base bank.</title>
<headline>Gunman gone as police storm Navy base bank.</headline>
<dateline>SEATTLE 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Heavily armed police stormed a bank on a nuclear submarine base Wednesday after a four-hour standoff, only to discover that the gunman they thought was inside had disappeared.</p>
<p>Ensign Fred Kuebler said a single bank employee was released unharmed after SWAT teams swept through the building on the naval base near Seattle and found no trace of the gunman.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't speculate on the details of how he left or when he left,&quot; Kuebler said.</p>
<p>The incident began about 8:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. PDT) when the unidentified gunman walked into the Kitsap Bank branch on the Bangor Naval Submarine Base and ordered the employee to lie on the floor.</p>
<p>The bank branch was quickly surrounded by naval police, FBI agents, state patrol officers and sheriff's deputies, who closed off roads leading to the building and finally went in.</p>
<p>Radio reports said the gunman did not take any money.</p>
<p>The base, on the Hood Canal near Silverdale, about 20 miles west of Seattle, serves as the West Coast home for the nation's fleet of Trident nuclear submarines and employs about 11,000 military and civilian personnel.</p>
