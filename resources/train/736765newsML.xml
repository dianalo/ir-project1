<p>Wall Street stocks were expected to gain in mixed trade at the open on Thursday, helped by solid earnings reports and momentum from the Dow's surge past the 8,000-point milestone yesterday.</p>
<p>While shares might see some early profit-taking, the stock market would likely wend its way higher, provided second quarter earnings reports were good, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will probably continue to drift a little higher,&quot; Charles White, managing director of Avatar Associates said. &quot;So far, earnings reports have been okay to slightly better than forecast...the bond market has some follow-through too.&quot;  </p>
<p>In early trade, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures index added 1.20 points to 943.50.</p>
<p>The long bond, which yesterday broke through resistance at a 6.5 percent yield, was up 4/32 at 6.47 percent.</p>
<p>The bond market firmed slightly after the release of jobless claims for the recent week, which fell to 347,000, near the forecast 345,000 level.</p>
<p>June housing starts data also came in close to expectations, rising to a 1.452 million unit annual rate.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial average closed up 63 points at 8039 yesterday. Nasdaq ended up 38.5 points at 1581.</p>
