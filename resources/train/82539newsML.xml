<title>UK: IMF gold sale plans irk world's big gold producers.</title>

<p>Big gold producers on Thursday said the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) plan to sell gold reserves was helping depress the price of gold bullion.</p>
<p>&quot;There is uncertainty hanging over the market right now as to what the IMF will do,&quot; said Sam Jonah, Chief Executive of Ashanti Goldfields Co Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully when the IMF uncertainty is removed, we would hope the fundamentals would take over and see an upturn in the gold prices,&quot; Jonah told Reuters at a gold conference sponsored by RBC Dominion Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Gold prices slumped on Thursday afternoon after news that the IMF had the necessary majority to sell five million ounces of gold from its reserves of approximately 104 million ounces.</p>
<p>The market has been increasingly nervous in recent weeks about the prospect of the sales being approved, even though analysts say the volume would be easily absorbed by the market.</p>
<p>Peter Munk, chairman of the world's third-largest gold mining house, Barrick Gold Corp, said the &quot;overhang&quot; of gold held by institutions such as the IMF and central banks was creating pessimism in the gold market.</p>
<p>Sales by central banks and other institutions have filled the so-called &quot;gap&quot; between supply and demand. Some 130,000 tonnes of gold, including jewellery and gold bars, are estimated to make up the world's stock of mined gold.</p>
<p>But Munk and the other directors and chairman of some of the world's biggest gold mining houses at the conference, agreed that in the long term, gold prices would head higher.</p>
<p>Growing demand from India and China, as the economies of those countries continued to grow, was cited as a major potential increase in demand.</p>
<p>&quot;The gap can be filled at the odd time by central bank sales and demand can be depressed temporarily, but the market has to respond to increased demand against supply,&quot; Munk said.</p>
<p>But John Willson, president and chief executive officer of Placer Dome Inc, sounded a note of caution.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is all this overhang. There are 120,000 tonnes of gold out there and what are they going to do with it? That to me is a real problem,&quot; Willson said.</p>
