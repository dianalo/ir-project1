<p>Jordan's stock market soared on Saturday to its highest level since mid-1995 on the heaviest global fund buying spree in years on attractively priced blue chips, dealers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said foreign interest in leading blue chips widened beyond three stocks which have been focus of a two-week old buying spree -- Jordan Cement, Arab Potash and Jordan Phosphate Mines -- to other banks and drug firms.</p>
<p>The official 60-share Amman Financial Market (AFM) index rose 2.42 percent to 162.76 points (Corrects rise in index and closing level) in strong trade worth 6.2 million dinars ($8.8 million).</p>
<p>The bourse has not reached this level since June 12, 1995, its highest level during that year, when it ended the trading session at 162.94 points.</p>
<p>They said price levels for blue chips looked attractive  in a market that has fallen around four percent since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Most of the buying orders continued to be executed by two main brokerage firms on behalf of a number of foreign funds lured by the attractively priced stock, while locals were mostly sellers, brokers said.</p>
<p>Jordan Cement shares alone accounted for more than half of Saturday's value of trade, rising 0.02 dinars to close at 4.29 dinars or near a maximum 5 percent daily price ceiling in trade worth nearly 3.4 million dinars.</p>
