<p>Israel, in a letter to the chief Palestinian peace negotiator, called on Tuesday for a halt to the killing of Arabs suspected of selling land to Jews in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Israel, blaming the PLO for the killing of three land dealers in one month, said on Monday the Jewish state must &quot;consider carefully&quot; before resuming peace talks with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and his fellow peace coordinator Jacob Bardugo wrote to their counterpart Saeb Erekat on Tuesday accusing Palestinian officials of making statements conveying support for the killings.</p>
<p>&quot;We emphatically demand that the Palestinian Council and its Executive Authority fulfil their obligation and undertaking under the peace agreements to immediately and effectively cease all such acts of incitement,&quot; their letter said.</p>
<p>The letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters, also called on the Palestinians &quot;to take all appropriate steps against anyone involved in the perpetration of such hostile acts&quot;.</p>
<p>Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has denied allegations by Israeli police that PLO officials were involved in the slayings. Israeli leaders said evidence pointed to Arafat's security agencies.</p>
<p>European Union envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos, who met Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, said: &quot;The European Union is against any kind of violence and we are against the death penalty and all kinds of these activities.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel had issued a warrant for the arrest of a person within the Palestinian Authority suspected of complicity in the policy.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage the investigation shows he was directly involved and we intend to detain him the moment he leaves the limits of the Palestinian Authority,&quot; he said on Tuesday without elaborating.</p>
<p>The killings of the three land dealers followed Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medeen's statement last month that Arabs who sold land to Jews could face the death penalty if convicted in court.</p>
<p>The PLO ban on land sales was imposed weeks after Israel broke ground on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem which brought peacemaking to a halt. Palestinians say such building pre-empts final status talks on Arab land occupied by Israel in 1967. Those talks have yet to begin under Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Palestinian Authority General-Secretary Ahmed Abdel-Rahman denied on Monday the Authority was behind the killings, but said the ban had dealt a severe blow to Israel's Jewish settlement drive in the West Bank.</p>
