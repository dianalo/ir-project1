<headline>Ceylon Tobacco profit up on better margin.</headline>
<dateline>COLOMBO 1997-02-26</dateline>

<p>Ceylon Tobacco Co Ltd's (CTC) profits in 1996 rose mainly on the back of improved operating margins and higher productivity, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>CTC, a subsidiary of British BAT Industries Plc, said earlier its net profit for the year to December 31, 1996, rose 21.6 percent to 575.22 million rupees compared to 472.95 million rupees the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;CTC's operating margins are much higher as a result of the cost cutting and productivity drive,&quot; said Avanka Herath, food and beverage sector analyst at brokerage Jardine Fleming.</p>
<p>The company's bottom line was also helped by the removal of a government tax surcharge, which saw the tax rate falling to 31.8 percent in 1996 from an earlier 39.4 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company was also spared the customary excise duty rise in the annual budget. Ceylon Tobacco, Sri Lanka's monopoly cigarette maker, and largest listed corporate in terms of turnover, already accounts for about 10 percent of the state's annual tax revenue.  </p>
<p>&quot;Now we are seeing the benefits of five to six years of work coming through,&quot; Mick Fenn, CTC's chairman, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The company began shedding unprofitable subsidiaries and refocusing on its core activities of tobacco and financial services in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Apart from portfolio brands of Gold Leaf and Bristol, CTC also introduced imported Benson &amp; Hedges in the local market last year to fight smuggling. Fenn said the Benson &amp; Hedges brand had begun to contribute to company's earnings.</p>
<p>Jardine Fleming said it was revising up profit forecasts of 607 million rupees, 686 million and 717 million for 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is just starting to look good after the recent restructuring. What we are seeing is only the beginning of better figures which are yet to come,&quot; said Mahendra Jayasekera, general manager of brokerge CT Smith. ($1 = 57.4 rupees)</p>
