<p>Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday France was as interested as Germany in a stable euro and warned it would be a mistake for some states to join European monetary union (EMU) before they were ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Premature entry of countries whose economies have not sufficiently converged would undermine the credibility of the euro,&quot; Trichet told an audience of German bankers.</p>
<p>During his speech, he repeatedly stressed the need for a stable euro currency.</p>
<p>But he did not directly address talks going on before Friday's European Union summit in Ireland on finding common ground over German calls for a tough stability pact.</p>
<p>No progress was reported at a Dublin meeting of EU finance ministers, where Germany was trying to ensure that only numbers can allow whether a country in recession can exceed the tight budget deficit target stipulated by the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>Presenting the Paris view on the pact, Trichet said its soundness could be reinforced under a French proposal to create a stability council -- to coordinate fiscal policy -- working in parallel to the independent European central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;This will be of key importance for the credibility of the euro and therefore for sound and sustainable growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Trichet said that, within the exchange rate mechanism, EU states had already built a credible track record of commitment to stability since the 1980s.</p>
<p>And France, which has had an independent central bank since 1993, has proved that it places as much importance as Germany in a strong currency.</p>
<p>France wants &quot;a euro as credible and as stable as the French franc, and as credible, as stable as the German mark,&quot; Trichet said. He added that Paris would be ready to join monetary union from the outset in 1999.</p>
<p>He said France's budget deficit, measured in relation to gross domestic product, would fall to three percent next year -- the Maastricht deficit ceiling -- from four percent in 1996 and fall further in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective here is not only to meet the criterion to join EMU, but even more important to secure a sustainable financial situation in the medium term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Without pointing the finger, Trichet warned countries struggling to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria next year in order to join currency union in 1999 to do their policy homework first before rushing to join.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a mistake for a country to join too soon whose economy was not prepared,&quot; he said, adding the result would be higher interest rates, low growth and weaker job creation.</p>
<p>Trichet described monetary union as Europe's &quot;last major structual reform&quot; which would remove economic barriers and turn the region into the world's largest unified market -- outsizing the U.S. and Japan.</p>
