<p>Afghanistan's Taleban movement, facing military reverses and the possibility of an alliance amongst its rivals, said on Friday it supported peace talks and called for a neutral army to be set up.</p>
<p>Acting deputy foreign minister Sher Mohammad Stanakzai told reporters he had yet to hear officially of Thursday's military alliance among leaders of the ousted government and two regional leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot say anything at the moment because I have just heard it from you. I was not aware of this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Uzbek chief Abdul Rashid Dostum, former government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood and Karim Khalili, head of the Shia Moslem Hezb-i-Wahadat, pledged to unite against the Taleban unless fighting stopped.</p>
<p>But contradicting remarks made on Thursday by acting information minister Amir Khan Mutaqi, in which he rejected calls for a U.N. ceasefire, Stanakzai said the Taleban supported such moves and efforts to start peace talks.</p>
<p>U.N. special envoy Norbert Holl called on Thursday for a ceasefire after the Taleban faced attacks from the forces of Masood, who controls the Panjsher valley some 80 km (50 miles) north of Kabul.</p>
<p>&quot;From our side there is no problem. We have assured him we never go for fighting unless they do so, especially with Dostum because we do not have any problem with him. We want to solve all the problems through negotiations and further discussion. He (Holl) agrees with that and is working on that,&quot; Stanakzai said.</p>
<p>Stanakzai admitted there had been casualties on both sides, but said the situation at Jabal-os-Siraj, south of the entrance to the Salang pass, was now calm.</p>
<p>&quot;After this minor clash was finished the situation is now calm. There is no problem, but both sides have suffered some casualties... We don't know the numbers but we have had some injuries and there are some people who died.</p>
<p>&quot;Today morning it is calm there is no fighting there.&quot;</p>
<p>Thursday's meeting in the north also called for a meeting of all faction leaders in the Dostum-held town of Mazar-i-Sharif to form a &quot;permanent government of Afghanistan&quot; and agreed to set up a Supreme Defence Council whose composition was to be decided later.</p>
<p>Stanakzai said the Taleban were still hopeful of conducting talks with Dostum, and were ready to go along with Holl's U.N. efforts under certain conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we have seen no conditions from their side,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no major conditions. The only thing we want for our country is peace and security. We want a neutral army to be formed, everybody should give their weapons to that army and after that representatives of the nation should be called, they should decide the future of Afghanistan.&quot;</p>
<p>Stanakzai dismissed former president Burhanuddin Rabbani as a spent force but said the Taleban was holding informal talks with neutral individuals linked to former prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf, a leader of a pro-Rabbani faction.</p>
<p>&quot;Sayyaf and Hekmatyar are contacting Taleban, but not officially, we have not got their representatives. There are other neutral people who have come, and we know that maybe they have been told by them to contact Taleban,&quot; he said.</p>
