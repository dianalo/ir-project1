<title>SOUTH KOREA: Seoul gold traders to raise transshipment trade.</title>
<headline>Seoul gold traders to raise transshipment trade.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-06-03</dateline>

<p>Some South Korean bullion houses are mulling increasing transshipment trade to secure funds with lower overseas interest rates as they are having difficulty borrowing from local banks, traders in Seoul said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are considering expanding our gold transshippment business to get stable money supply from overseas,&quot; a trader with a major bullion house said.</p>
<p>The dealer said local companies are having trouble borrowing funds from domestic financial institutions, which are worrying about payment defaults following a string of corporate collapses this year.  </p>
<p>The ratio of South Korea's defaults on notes hit a 15-year high of 0.25 percent in April, compared with 0.15 percent in the same month a year ago and 0.24 percent in March, the central Bank of Korea said.</p>
<p>The notes would include such debts as promissory notes and bank cheques.</p>
<p>It said the rise was largely due to the defaults by affiliate companies of financially troubled groups.</p>
<p>The trader said current stability of the foreign exchange market also helped the bullion houses to increase bullion transshipment trade.  </p>
<p>Last July, South Korea cracked down on booming bullion transshipment trade by shortening the deferred-payment period to a maximum of 30 days from 120 days.</p>
<p>Bullion houses had imported huge amounts of gold on 90-day deferred payments, immediately exported the yellow metal and parked the proceeds in high interest-bearing domestic money market instruments.</p>
<p>They reaped huge profits from arbitrage between local interest rates of more than 11 percent and London Interbank Offered Rates of around five percent.  </p>
<p>Several local companies were seen getting around the government crackdown by setting up local refining plants. Gold imports for refining are still subject to the old 120-day deferred-payment rule.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a trader with a local producer said demand for the company's output was depressed by a continued influx of smuggled gold and recent oversupply of North Korean gold.</p>
<p>&quot;North Korea sold a record amount of gold during March and April to fund birthday celebrations for the late 'Great Leader' Kim Il-sung,&quot; the trader said.  </p>
<p>According to data by the Unification Ministry, North Korea sold 2,538 kg of gold worth $29 million to the South in the two months, up sharply from 760 kg worth $9.4 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Last year, North Korea sold 4,738 kg of gold worth $58.8 million to South Korea.</p>
<p>North Korean gold sales to the South returned to normal in May, he said.</p>
<p>Traders in the South also said local retail sellers' sales had been dampened by recent student demonstration as most retail shops are in central Seoul, where clashes between radical students and riot police typically occur.  </p>
<p>&quot;Most retail sellers are closing their shops earlier than usual to avoid any damage from the clash between students and police,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Domestic gold producer LG Metals' daily selling price for the precious metal, which is regarded as a benchmark for the local bullion wholesale market, was unchanged on Tuesday at 10,250 won per gram over the past week.</p>
<p>The company's silver price was also flat at 151 won a gram.</p>
<p>The Korea Exchange Bank posted on Tuesday the telegraphic transfer selling rate for customers at 894.70 won against the dollar, barely unchanged from a week ago. The rate is regarded as a benchmark of local foreign exchange rates for companies.</p>
<p>(US$1 = 894.70 won)</p>
