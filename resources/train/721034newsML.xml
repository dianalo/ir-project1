<headline>Cambodian coup again leaves Sihanouk marginalised.</headline>

<p>For the second time in his long and turbulent career, a political power change in Cambodia has left King Norodom Sihanouk isolated, abroad and politically marginalised.</p>
<p>In 1970, the then Prince Sihanouk was overthrown in a right-wing military coup while he was on a trip to Russia. The monarchy was subsequently abolished.</p>
<p>Sihanouk's son, First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, was ousted by his co-premier Hun Sen on Sunday after two days of heavy fighting between their forces in the river-side capital.</p>
<p>The king was in Beijing, where he has been receiving medical treatment for several ailments, as Hun Sen's troops launched a fierce attack on his son's official residence, a stone's throw from the ornate central Phnom Penh royal palace on Sunday.</p>
<p>Hun Sen said on Thursday he would not change Cambodia into a republic, but the future role of the country's monarchy was nevertheless now in question, political analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Effectively, the monarchy is finished,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot see Sihanouk returning to give legitimacy to this government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen announced Ranariddh's ouster in a Sunday television broadcast and bluntly rejected Sihanouk's offer to hold reconciliation talks with the two premiers.</p>
<p>&quot;It is heard that the king proposes to have reconciliation in Beijing,&quot; Hun Sen said. &quot;It is too late and it is not necessary. Everything is over.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, with relative calm restored and the battered airport functioning again, almost a dozen members of the royal family left the country, including Ranariddh's sister, Princess Bopha Devei, and his son, Prince Norodom Chakravuth.</p>
<p>They were the most recent in a long list of royal family members to leave, or be forced out, of Cambodia in recent years.</p>
<p>Hun Sen has long had an ambivalent relationship with Sihanouk. The powerful second premier said earlier this year that members of the royal family should be excluded from politics.</p>
<p>The king still retains widespread respect amongst his people, especially in the countryside, and some analysts suggested Hun Sen would like nothing more than to see the king out of the political picture once and for all.</p>
<p>&quot;Hun Sen's worst nightmare is the king coming back and challenging him for power,&quot; said an Asian diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;His (Sihanouk's) popular support had a positive impact on FUNCINPEC in the 1993 election,&quot; another analyst said, referring to the Ranariddh's political party.</p>
<p>FUNCINPEC won the election, but the king brokered a power-sharing coalition with Hun Sen after Hun Sen objected to the poll result.</p>
<p>Sihanouk and Hun Sen were on opposing sides during the 1980s when Sihanouk led royalist forces in an alliance with the Khmer Rouge and a smaller non-communist guerrilla group against Hun Sen and his Hanoi-backed government in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>After years of tortuous negotiations, the warring factions signed a peace treaty in 1991 and Sihanouk became head of state and was recrowned king in September 1993 in the aftermath of United Nations-run elections.</p>
<p>But since then he has become increasingly marginalised, partly due to his poor health and partly because he was, in the end, out-manoeuvred and rebuffed by Hun Sen, analysts said.</p>
<p>There was now little he could do to solve Cambodia's current political crisis, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The king can't do anything, he has limited power and influence,&quot; one Cambodian source said.</p>
<p>&quot;He has a lot of will power but he's old, his health is not great and he's far away from Cambodia&quot;.</p>
