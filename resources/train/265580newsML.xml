<p>Media magnate Rupert Murdoch has upset the Australian government by accusing it of achieving nothing major in its first nine months and allowing itself to be diverted by the racism debate.</p>
<p>In remarks aired nationally on Wednesday, the Australian-born chairman of global media group News Corp said the conservative government needed to push the pace of reform.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got a lot of things to do in Australia and we can't afford to have a government that's just a 'status quo' government,&quot; Murdoch told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio in Tokyo on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard's government had been diverted from the task of reform to handle a racism row sparked by maverick politician Pauline Hanson and to press for tough gun laws after April's Port Arthur massacre, Murdoch said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they were elected with a tremendous mandate and then they were diverted by the gun laws and by Ms Hanson and all that stuff, which really shouldn't have taken their attention perhaps,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's very important for Australia, if it's going to engage in Asia and going to grow really well, we have to get on with structural reform, tax reform, labour reform and a whole lot of things.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's been major achievements in the first year and it's only a three-year term. In Australia, you have to hurry.&quot;</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called Murdoch's comments &quot;a bit rich&quot; and cited government's reform of industrial relations, the partial privatisation of telecommunications carrier Telstra and big cuts in budget spending.</p>
<p>&quot;He's wrong,&quot; Fischer told a business meeting in Melbourne on Wednesday. &quot;This is a bit rich coming from Rupert Murdoch...&quot;</p>
