<p>France assured the 14 members of the African Franc zone on Wednesday that their French-backed currency would keep its value when the French franc is replaced in 1999 by the planned new European currency known as the Euro.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no devaluation&quot; of the CFA franc currency when European monetary union comes into effect, Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said after hosting a one-day meeting attended by his counterparts from France's former African colonies.  </p>
<p>All that would change when the new European currency is introduced is that the CFA franc's parity would be fixed &quot;against the Euro instead of the franc,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new single European currency is to come into effect under monetary union due to start on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The ministers from the 14 African countries gave an upbeat message at their regular half-yearly meeting about their countries' economic prospects in the wake of the devaluation three years ago of the CFA franc against the French franc.</p>
<p>&quot;The message is one of confidence,&quot; Arthuis told reporters.  </p>
<p>France's 13 former African colonies devalued their common currency by 50 percent in 1994. The 14th country in the zone, the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean, devalued by 33 percent.</p>
<p>France precipitated the drastic devaluation by making its aid contingent on the countries winning the International Monetary Fund's backing. The IMF demanded they break a 46-year-old fixed parity with the franc because it made their manufacturing costs higher than their neighbours and was paralysing economic growth. Since devaluation, growth has returned and exports have risen.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have mastered inflation...we have mastered spending,&quot; Cote d'Ivoire finance minister Niamien N'Goran said.</p>
<p>He said inflation in west Africa had been wrestled down to between minus one percent to plus nine percent, depending on the country. It had been running at an average 40 percent in the Franc zone only three years ago.</p>
<p>The ministers said growth in the zone should be at least 4.6 percent in 1996 after shrinking on average by 0.8 percent a year from 1990 to 1993. But the ministers said more needed to be done to encourage private investment.</p>
<p>The ministers also urged more progress on debt relief. But N'Goran was optimistic the Paris Club of creditor nations would agree to offer better debt relief conditions than the Naples terms currently available -- under which two-thirds of the debt of low-income countries can be written off.</p>
<p>N'Goran said the countries were pressing for the terms to be amended to allow up to 80 percent of the debt to be written off. Debt costs were &quot;preventing essential investment in basic areas like health and education,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arthuis said France supported easier debt relief on a &quot;case by case basis&quot; and was optimistic accord would soon be reached.</p>
