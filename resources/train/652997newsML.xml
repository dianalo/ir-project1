<p>Brazil exported 1.33 million 60-kg bags of coffee, ground and in beans, in May, up from an adjusted April figure of 1.22 million bags, Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (Febec) said.</p>
<p>Previously Febec had estimated April exports at 1.21 million bags.</p>
<p>The May total is almost twice the 695,815 bags exported in the same month in 1996.</p>
<p>Brazilian exports so far this year have reached 6.46 million bags, more than twice the 3.01 million bags shipped in the first five months of 1996.  </p>
<p>Under an agreement with other producing countries, Brazil was not to ship more than six million bags in the first six months of this calendar year.</p>
<p>Given current export performance, the government last week asked exporters to make no more new sales for June and to delay as much as possible shipments at the end of June until July.</p>
<p>June exports were expected to be significantly lower than in May, Febec said today.</p>
<p>By June 9, only 79,000 bags had been loaded onto ships against 218,000 bags by the same period last month, it added.  </p>
<p>The May sales brought total earnings from coffee exports this year to $1.13 billion, 253 percent higher than the $446.89 million earned in the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>Revenue last month was $268.96 million against $109.08 million in May last year and $248.07 million in April 1997.</p>
<p>The average price per bag rose to $202.76 in May compared with $202.73 in April, Febec said.</p>
<p>Of May's total, 1.29 million bags were arabica coffee, while shipments of conillon reached 40,327 bags.</p>
