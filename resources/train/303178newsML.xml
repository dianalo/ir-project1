<p>The commander of NATO forces in Europe said on Monday that land mines and the military potential of factional police forces in Bosnia were key concerns for international peacekeepers there.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (mine clearing) has not moved as quickly as we would like,&quot; U.S. Army Gen. George Joulwan told reporters. &quot;Every week in Bosnia, civilians are being maimed or killed by mines.&quot;</p>
<p>The supreme allied commander of forces in Europe (SACEUR) said clearing thousands of mines sown during the civil war was the responsibility of Serbs, Moslems and Croats and the effort should be increased as a NATO-led peacekeeping force of more than 31,000 begins a new 18-month mission there.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of mines in Yugoslavia is going to be with us for a long time to come&quot; Joulwan said at a breakfast with reporters and added this was an example of the international problem of dealing with so-called &quot;dumb mines.&quot;</p>
<p>The four-star general, based in Belgium in a dual role of NATO'S SACEUR and of U.S. forces in Europe, also expressed concern over the potential for violence involving police forces in Bosnia.</p>
<p>These police units, which the New York Times has reported may be stockpiling mortars and other weapons, are sometimes commanded by Serbs, Moslems or Croats loyal to their own factions rather than to all citizens.</p>
<p>&quot;I share your concern on the size and armaments of some of the former warring fractions' police forces,&quot; Joulwan said in response to a question.</p>
<p>He noted that the police forces were being overseen by an unarmed contingent of fewer than 2,000 international police officers sponsored by the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to see an increased role and mandate for them,&quot; said Joulwan of the international monitors.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, local police forces in Bosnia must be trained to efficiently handle routine law enforcement functions so that peacekeeping troops were not faced with such tasks.</p>
<p>The United States is providing 8,500 troops as part of the new international peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Joulwan said the American soldiers would be rotated every six months, from about April.</p>
