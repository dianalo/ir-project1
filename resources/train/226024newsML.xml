<p>New Zealand share prices ended Friday's session with a flat tone, although brokers were encouraged by a pick up in volume in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A respite from the lethargy is not expected until New Zealand forms a coalition government after the major parties have spent weeks negotiating with New Zealand First Party leader Winston Peters, who holds the balance of power.</p>
<p>An indication from Peters is expected next week.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 2.06 points higher at 2,348.42 on turnover worth NZ$50 million, Fletcher Energy making up about a quarter of the market.  </p>
<p>Fletcher Paper was also actively traded.</p>
<p>Supermarket chain Progressive Enterprises picked up two cents to NZ$1.37 from countercyclical investors after the annual meeting, where chairman Don Humphreys said an interim dividend could be expected.</p>
<p>GPG was steady at NZ$0.82 after announcing it had taken a nibble out of DB's share registry. DB has said it is mulling ways of returning capital to shareholders and GPG's move was aimed at cashing in on that, whichever form it may take.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Tim Koller at Hendry Hay McIntosh said:  </p>
<p>&quot;We're just going to have a continuation of the trend of a sideways market until we see resolution of the political situation, which obviously flows through into monetary policy and whether there is going to be room for an easing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still in limbo waiting for that, as much of New Zealand is,&quot; he said.</p>
