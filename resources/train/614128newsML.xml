<p>The Taleban Islamic government in Afghanistan told an opposition Shi'ite faction holding a central province to sit down to immediate peace talks or face attack.</p>
<p>A Taleban spokesman, quoted by a Pakistan-based Afghan news service, said the purist Islamic movement had sent a message to the Shi'ite Hezb-i-Wahdat faction in Bamiyan province to send a delegation to the capital for talks.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have told them that if (the talks) were delayed, then we will enter Bamiyan by force, and then Hezb-i-Wahdat will be responsible for any bloodshed,&quot; the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) quoted spokesman Abdul Wakil as saying by telephone from the southern Afghan town of Kandahar.</p>
<p>It quoted Mohammad Rasul Taleb, a Wahdat spokesman in the northwestern Pakistani town of Peshawar, as saying that his faction had always stood for peace and would try to hold talks with the Taleban.</p>
<p>But he would not say whether Wahdat, a partner in an anti-Taleban alliance, would send a delegation to Kabul.</p>
<p>Taleban forces have been meeting stiff Wahdat resistance in their attempts to enter Bamiyan.</p>
<p>Wakil said the Taleban, who claimed the capture of five opposition-controlled provinces in northern Afghanistan at the weekend along with their new ethnic Uzbek allies, wanted to bring all areas under their Islamic government peacefully.</p>
<p>Pakistan, which on Sunday became the first country to recognise the Taleban government, has sent its ambassador to Afghanistan, Aziz Khan, to reopen his embassy, which has been closed since September 1995.</p>
<p>Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan told a news conference on Sunday that Islamabad had previously withheld recognition to give time for the promotion of a broad-based government through peaceful negotiations.</p>
<p>But he said the Taleban government now &quot;genuinely comprises various ethnic groups in Afghanistan&quot;. The government was set up last September when the Islamic miltia captured the capital Kabul and now controls 26 of the country's 32 provinces, the minister said.</p>
<p>Opposition leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, ousted from his fiefdom in northern Afghanistan on Saturday, arrived in the Turkish capital of Ankara on Sunday, vowing to continue his struggle for the control of his country.</p>
<p>The Taleban advance ended an eight-month deadlock between them and a fragile coalition linking Dostum with the forces of ousted Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, former prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami and the Hezb-i-Wahdat.</p>
<p>The alliance forces are now in tatters and stranded from supply lines in the Hindu Kush mountains. But Wahdat has put up resistance in Bamiyan and former government military commander Ahmed Shah Masood holds part of the northeast.</p>
