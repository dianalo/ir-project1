<headline>FOCUS-S.African one-day strike has mixed impact.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-06-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>South African unions began a one-day national strike on Monday against new labour laws, with mass marches in the cities, but its early impact was mixed.</p>
<p>A fifth of the country's half a million miners joined the strike to protest at the planned Basic Conditions of Employment Bill, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said.</p>
<p>Police said they expected up to 50,000 strikers to march through the centre of the industrial capital Johannesburg in the biggest of a series of rallies around the country.</p>
<p>Officials at the gold mines on which South Africa's economy was founded and at the country's major ports said the effect of the stoppage was uneven.</p>
<p>Toyota South Africa Ltd said its Prospecton plant, employing 5,500 people outside Durban, was shut and stood to lose the production of 450 vehicles.</p>
<p>Clothes makers around Cape Town said the strike was &quot;crippling&quot; with about two-thirds of workers staying away.</p>
<p>The employment bill, approved by cabinet in April, sets a 45 hour working week and four months maternity leave.</p>
<p>Cosatu, the biggest union federation with 1.9 million members, wants a 40 hour week, six months maternity leave and the minimum age for formal employment to be set at 18.</p>
<p>Labour, business and government have reached an impasse in negotiations over the bill. Cosatu is in an uneasy alliance with President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress, and differences over economic policy are causing strains.</p>
<p>At gold and platinum mines, officials reported some shifts working as normal and others reduced to skeleton staffing.</p>
<p>Anglo American Platinum Corp Ltd, the world's biggest producer, said its main Rustenburg Platinum Holdings Ltd unit was working as usual. Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd also reported normal work.</p>
<p>Anglogold, the largest gold producer, and Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd reported varying disruption but Avmin was harder hit.</p>
<p>&quot;On the gold mines we've got only essential services working,&quot; said spokesman Julian Gwillim.</p>
<p>Randgold and Exploration Co Ltd said production at four of its six mines had been halted.</p>
<p>However, a spokesman for the Chamber of Mines employers' group said that based on past experience the strike was unlikely to have a significant impact on gold production.</p>
<p>In Cape Town, port authorities said shipping had not been affected but some workers had stayed away. More of the city's workers were expected to down tools for a midday rally.</p>
<p>Officials at Durban said the country's biggest port had been hit by 50 percent absenteeism on Monday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to say if it is on account of the strike or because of transport problems,&quot; a port spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>State-run South African Airways said it had suffered little disruption but international flights leaving in the evening might be disrupted.</p>
<p>Business South Africa, an employers' forum, attacked the strike in a country with unemployment at around a third and relatively high labour costs.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a destructive use of collective bargaining power and most importantly it's wasteful of the kind of economy we are trying to create in South Africa,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The opposition Inkatha Freedom Party said the strike served the interests of &quot;myopic trade unions&quot; and would hurt jobs and worsen inflation.</p>
