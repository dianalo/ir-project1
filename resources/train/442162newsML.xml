<p>Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Friday there were signs the economic slowdown was over and South Africa could have its fourth year in a row of around three percent growth in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally one would have expected after three-and-a-half years of economic expansion that the business cycle will turn, that economic activities will decline... that you will go through almost a recessionary period,&quot; Stals told the parliamentary finance committee.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a slow down in growth for about six or nine months and... we are already at this stage seeing some signs of recovery and improvement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So maybe we can have this kind of three to three-and-a- half percent growth for the fourth year in succession in 1997 and in 1997 it will be more balanced growth also...</p>
<p>&quot;We feel fairly comfortable about prospects for the economy in 1997. Things may go better than predicted or expected at the end of last year and early this year,&quot; Stals said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, delivering the 1997/98 budget on Wednesday, said real gross domestic product was expected to grow by 2.5 percent in 1997, down from 3.1 percent in 1996.</p>
