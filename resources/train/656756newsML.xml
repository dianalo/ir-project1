<p>The Federal Reserve remains watchful for signs that current tight U.S. labor markets may fuel wage-related inflation, a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta economist said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We (at the Fed) are still concerned about the relative tightness in the labor markets,&quot; Atlanta Fed economist Mark Rogers told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to look forward in terms of how the relatively short supply of labor may impact the inflation outlook,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Rogers explained that one difficulty for the Fed in assessing the relationship between growth and inflation is that, while U.S. productivity rose in recent years, official data do not capture these gains well.</p>
<p>&quot;Official government statistics understate productivity which complicates our ability to evaluate these (job and inflation) trends,&quot; the Atlanta Fed economist said.</p>
<p>Rogers spoke to Reuters after the release of the Atlanta Fed's Southeastern manufacturing survey for May.</p>
<p>The sixth-district Atlanta Fed covers Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.  </p>
<p>The survey showed a slowdown in business activity from April coupled with a drop in prices received by Southeastern manufacturers while prices paid rose at a slower pace.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic picture is one where prices are still subdued. There is no new information in the May figures because most of the weakness responded to prices in the food industry,&quot; Rogers said.&quot;I don't think we should infer from these numbers that there was a resurgence or acceleration in inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Rogers also said manufacturers in the Southeast are reporting to some computer-related improvements in managing inventories.  </p>
<p>&quot;There has been a steady improvement in that area, not only due to capital investments, but also due to new software applications,&quot; Rogers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturers are telling us they are clearly managing inventories better than they had in past years, though there still is room for improvement,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But Rogers stopped short of pronouncing the business cycle dead, describing it as &quot;not as volatile, a perhaps kinder, tamer business cycle.&quot;</p>
<p>The Atlanta Fed economist also credited shorter delivery times for imports for the better management of inventories.  </p>
<p>&quot;Swings in demand are met by changes in inventories abroad which also helps smooth our production cycle,&quot; Rogers noted.</p>
<p>Rogers said the slower pace of production and new orders in May did not change the overall picture for a still healthy manufacturing sector in the Southeast.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook is encouraging, suggesting continued moderate growth,&quot; said Rogers of the survey's six-month outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturers expect a rebound in orders, which is consistent with the view the current weakness is temporary.&quot;</p>
<p>Rogers also pointed out that manufacturing surveys always include areas that are subject to fluctuations.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, the current data indicate we have a balanced manufacturing sector in the Southeast in terms of anticipated production gains being moderate,&quot; said Rogers who added the Southeast continues to lure manufacturers and workers away from other U.S. regions, contributing to local economic growth.</p>
