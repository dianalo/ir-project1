<headline>St. Jude says focused on integration.</headline>
<dateline>ST. PAUL, Minn. 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>St. Jude Medical Inc said it is concentrating on integration activities, including training its sales force to sell implantable defibrillators, or ICDs, made by Ventritex Inc, which was acquired in May.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now in the integration, execution and growth stage of our cardiac rhythm management strategy,&quot; said chief executive Ronald Matricaria in a statement that accompanied release of the company's second-quarter results.</p>
<p>Net sales for the second quarter increased 19 percent to $261 million from $220 million in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Excluding several special items, St. Jude said second-quarter earnings totalled $0.36 per share, up from $0.32 per share a year ago. Including all special items, the company earned $0.09 per share on the most recent quarter.</p>
<p>St. Jude shares closed Wednesday up 1-3/16 at 40-13/16 on the New York Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>The company reported that second-quarter 1997 net sales by division were as follows: heart valve disease management $75 million (up nine percent), cardiac rhythm management $169 million (up 17 percent), interventional cardiology $9 million (up 11 percent) and other $8 million.</p>
<p>After making the complex and long-awaited $365 million purchase of Ventritex, St. Jude is preparing to unleash its 400-person sales team with Ventritex's ICDs in a bid to become a strong third competitor in the ICD field.</p>
<p>The fast-growing market for ICDs -- small electronic devices implanted in the body and wired to the heart to keep it from beating too fast -- is dominated by Medtronic Inc and Guidant Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of Ventritex's ICD and pacing products along with Daig's fast-growing electrophysiology and clinical-stage atrial fibrillation products and Pacesetter's pacemaker systems, gives our CRM business one of the broadest product offerings in the industry and essentially completes this technology platform,&quot; Matricaria said.</p>
<p>St. Jude acquired Daig Corp in mid-1996.</p>
