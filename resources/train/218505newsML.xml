<p>Last-ditch talks on rescuing Canadian Airlines Corp. appeared at an impasse Monday as two of its biggest unions stood firm in their opposition to wage concessions and instead proposed a C$400 million ($296 million) government bailout for the airline.</p>
<p>Four of the Calgary-based company's six unions have agreed to the company's restructuring plan which called for a 10 percent pay cut. Canadian has set a Wednesday deadline for an agreement on the restructuring before loan payments come due on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Time is running out fast,&quot; said Canadian Airlines President Kevin Benson. Without an agreement by Wednesday, &quot;I think the whole plan starts to unravel.&quot;</p>
<p>Canadian has said it will be forced to cease operations early next year if it cannot restructure its operations.</p>
<p>But the Canadian Auto Workers union and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which together represent 6,300 of the airline's 16,400 workers, have dug in their heels in opposition to demands for pay cuts.</p>
<p>The CAW represents ticket agents and is the second-biggest union at Canadian after the International Association of Machinists while CUPE bargains for flight attendants and is the third biggest union at the airline.</p>
<p>They contend their members have already sacrificed enough to ensure the airline's survival by way of previous concessions and productivity improvements.</p>
<p>&quot;We have given and given and given,&quot; said CAW President Buzz Hargrove after meeting Transport Minister David Anderson on Monday. &quot;They can't ask our membership to give any more.&quot;</p>
<p>The continued opposition of the CAW and CUPE diminished earlier hopes for a breakthrough Monday. The unions representing the machinists and pilots had earlier held out hope a rescue deal could be sealed on Monday but chances for a deal appeared slim as the day progressed.</p>
<p>Benson and officials from the unions representing machinists and pilots separately presented a request for federal government assistance to Anderson at a meeting in Vancouver on Monday. None of the participants would reveal the details of that plan but it was believed to rely primarily on measures like an easing in fuel taxes.</p>
<p>While pleased to see four unions and management working together, Anderson said Ottawa could not act until the restructuring plan won support from all six unions and the company. &quot;I hope there will be movement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The rescue will also require backing from Canadian's creditors including major lender Royal Bank of Canada and AMR Corp. of Dallas, the parent of American Airlines, which has a one-third stake in Canadian.</p>
<p>The CAW and CUPE presented a separate plan to Anderson calling for the federal, Alberta and British Columbia governments to inject C$100 million ($75 million) a year for four years into Canadian. Ottawa would also acquire an equity stake in the airline under the plan.</p>
<p>The proposal calls for re-regulation of the airline industry to protect Canadian from cuthroat competition.</p>
<p>&quot;There comes a point when workers say we have given too much ... Making this into a cheap-labor airline is not going to solve the financial problems of this company in the long run,&quot; said Judy Darcy, CUPE national president.</p>
<p>Anderson appeared cool to the idea, saying the government did not have C$400 million ($300 million) to inject into Canadian in the absence of an agreement by all unions on the restructuring.</p>
<p>He refused to specify what sort of financial aid, if any, the government would consider if there was an agreement. He declined to say whether Ottawa would consider taking a stake in the airline.</p>
