<p>Ukraine will probably pass the much-delayed 1997 budget next month, the head of the Taxation Administration and of parliament's Budget Committee Mykola Azarov said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The budget, whose passage must be preceded by approval of a package of tax reform laws, has delayed Ukraine's receipt of a $2.5 to $3.0 billion, three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the most favourable circumstances parliament would get the budget draft on Friday at the earliest, and that's only if it passed the new tax laws on taxing profits of business and taxing income,&quot; Azarov told a news conference.</p>
<p>Azarov said deputies would also be unable to meet their own deadline to approve three new tax laws by tomorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;According to parliament's own timetable it is planned to give a second reading to law on taxing profits of businesses, but I doubt it will happen because the final version of the law has not yet been handed to deputies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The budget and tax laws have been stuck between government and parliament. President Leonid Kuchma has blamed the problems on Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, who earlier this month urged deputies to pass the budget and laws by the end of this month.</p>
<p>An IMF mission is visiting Kiev this week to review budget progress and consider granting the EFF to succeed the $867 stand-by agreement which expired last month.</p>
<p>Azarov blamed government and parliament equally for delays.</p>
<p>&quot;Five months have passed since the government presented the tax package and draft budget to parliament, so there has been plenty of time to pass any law,&quot; Azarov said.</p>
<p>Eight tax laws remain to be passed, after the first one on value-added tax was approved earlier this month.</p>
<p>The legislation could face further delays as the government has declared a nine-day holiday due to start next week to celebrate Orthodox Easter, Labour Day and the end of World War Two.</p>
