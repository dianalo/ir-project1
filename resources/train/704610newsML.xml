<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bosnia entered the final stages of negotiations on Thursday for a stand-by agreement, hoping to clear the way for a conference on post-war aid, Western officials said.</p>
<p>Most of the IMF's preconditions for a stand-by agreement for $100 million in assistance over one year have been met, but two outstanding issues remain to be resolved, officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of action is expected until Monday because the deal should be wrapped up by next week if we want to see the donors' conference in the second half of July,&quot; said an official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;Both Bosnia's entities have to fix some unresolved fiscal issues in their budgets, and they have to agree on the design of the country's interim currency,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Designing an interim currency, called the convertible mark, is a sensitive political issue among former wartime foes leading the country's autonoumous territories, the Moslem-Croat federation and the Serb republic.</p>
<p>Leaders of both entities pay special tribute to nationalist symbols offensive to their counterparts.</p>
<p>Under a recently brokered agreement, former enemies are supposed to exchange mutually acceptable proposals for a currency that will have a common name but different design in each entity.</p>
<p>&quot;There are proposals on the table but now, the question is to reconcile them to the extent that is possible,&quot; the official said.&quot;It's obvious that nobody is falling in love with the other guy's solutions, and the question now is how you come to terms with this.&quot;</p>
<p>The IMF will also be looking to harmonise revenues and expenditures in the country's budget before signing a letter of intent with Bosnia, the official said.</p>
<p>A recent World Bank study said tax systems in both entities need to be reformed and that military and public expenditures are excessive.</p>
<p>&quot;Substantial progress has been made in fixing the fiscal issues, and there is some progress on the design front now that we at least have proposals on the table,&quot; the official said. &quot;We are travelling the last mile of the road, but it could last forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Political turmoil that erupted this week in the Serb entity, where President Biljana Plavsic is struggling to stay in power, could have hurt negotiations.</p>
<p>A reshuffle of the Bosnian Serb government could &quot;slow everything down,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Without an agreement with the IMF next week, Bosnia's reconstruction conference could be postponed again.</p>
<p>&quot;If the conference is not held in July, August is vacation time. So, it's easy to predict September,&quot; he said.</p>
