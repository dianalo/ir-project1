<p>A baroque grande dame of a city, Russia's second city St Petersburg seems an unlikely candidate to host the 2004 Olympics.</p>
<p>Five million people face a daily battle with poverty, power cuts and galloping urban decay in the Baltic port city, founded in 1703 by Peter the Great as a &quot;window on the West&quot;.</p>
<p>And although one of the legacies of  the communism has been an impressive array of venues, most need major overhauls.</p>
<p>These include the 80,000-seat Kirov Stadium, a massive earthwork built on the Gulf of Finland by German prisoners of war, and a swimming pool which earned brief notoriety during the Goodwill Games three years ago.</p>
<p>Murky water, of a distinctly unsavoury shade of green, forced organisers to postpone the swimming competition for 24 hours.</p>
<p>And there was further frustrations for competitors and spectators when Russian officials promised but did not deliver a proper ice skating rink in time for the start of either the short track speed skating or the figure skating.</p>
<p>The Russian government argues that hosting the Olympics in the city once known as Leningrad would be an international stamp of approval on its efforts to replace communism with democracy.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has taken a high profile personal role in heading the bidding team at President Boris Yeltsin's behest. The premier says the bid is a &quot;political issue&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The commitment of the government is obvious. It's very, very appealing,&quot; said Alexander Kozlovsky, vice-president of the Russian Olympic Committee, alluding to widespread criticism of Atlanta's flawed private enterprise Games last year.</p>
<p>Russian officials say the Olympics would not strain the state budget since the bulk of the money is already committed for the canal-lined city's tercentenary. Additional costs would be covered by sales of television rights and other income.</p>
<p>Major new investments include a rowing canal, a second pool plus an athletes' village that would be turned into permament housing. Other events would be cheaper to mount, although plans for beach volleyball by the River Neva next to dungeons which housed generations of political prisoners might raise some eyebrows.</p>
<p>Culturally St Petersburg has obvious appeal. The architecture is magnificent with grandiose palaces and cathedrals painted in bold, warm Mediterranean colours and there is a staggering variety of cultural activities.</p>
<p>The Hermitage holds one of the world's most extensive art collections and the Kirov ballet (renamed the Mariinskiy) is situated here.</p>
<p>Goodwill Games' organiser Jack Kelly, who became intimately involved with the peculiar problems of organising a major sporting event in Russia, said at the time he believed St Petersburg's time could come, but not in 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;It has a mixture of east and west, it has all the peripheral programmes necessary, the culture and the arts,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;But it certainly needs more facilities and more hotels.&quot;</p>
