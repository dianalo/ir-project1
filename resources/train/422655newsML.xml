<p>Singapore's major banks are unlikely to suffer much damage from Thailand's banking crisis and should easily ride it out, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to say how much loan exposure the Singapore banks have to Thailand, because they don't publish that information, but on the earnings side it would be minimal,&quot; said Lai Yeu Huan, analyst at Singapore brokerage J.M. Sassoon.</p>
<p>Shares in Singapore's four big banks -- Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC), Overseas Union Bank (OUB) and United Overseas Bank (UOB) -- have all fallen in recent days after almost three months of gains.</p>
<p>The foreign tranche of shares in DBS, for example, fell to a low of Singapore $17.90 (US$12.60) on Wednesday, from a high of S$20.30 on February 20.</p>
<p>These falls coincided with news of a major shake-up in Thailand's banking sector as the central bank announced a series of government measures to bolster financial institutions.</p>
<p>The bank ordered 10 finance companies on Monday to raise capital immediately and raised provisioning levels to American standards of 115 percent of doubtful assets for banks and to 120 percent for finance companies.</p>
<p>This followed months of speculation about Thai asset quality that helped shave nearly half the value off the stock market while leaving the baht open to talk of devaluation.</p>
<p>But analysts said the slide in Singapore banking shares probably had more to do with worries over the forthcoming local annual results season than fears for the health of Singapore loan portfolios.</p>
<p>If the Thai news had had an effect, it may have been merely to spur some profit-taking, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The big four banks all get less than five percent of their earnings from Thailand,&quot; Lai said.</p>
<p>They had also all made large provisions for possible overseas risks, in line with tough local banking rules.</p>
<p>Another analyst at a local research house said Singapore banks were involved in loan syndications to Thai companies but the extent of this was unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point of time, with the information we have, their exposure is not significant compared to the banks total assets,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;Local banks have more exposure to Malaysia and Hong Kong. I don't think Thailand is a significant market for them,&quot; agreed an analyst with a U.S. financial house.</p>
<p>Other analysts said they thought Singapore's banking sector could offer a few nice surprises from the annual results.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction over the last few days has been a knee-jerk,&quot; said another analyst, who declined to be identified. &quot;Singapore banks are very well capitalised.&quot;</p>
<p>Most analysts think the sector will show an average net profit rise of around 14 percent year-on-year for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of 1996 earnings, banks will not disappoint,&quot; said Chen Young Mee, deputy director of research at Vickers Ballas Investment Research.</p>
<p>Shares in OCBC, OUB and UOB all recovered some ground on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
