<p>Irish Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn on Wednesday announced &quot;the biggest tax reduction package in the history of the State&quot; in an election-year budget which reaped the harvest of sustained strong economic growth.</p>
<p>But economists voiced concern that a one percentage point cuts in standard income tax, to 26 percent, and payroll tax pay-related social insurance, would fuel a consumer spending spree and inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget will contribute about 2.25 percent to household incomes on an annualised basis and at the margin this will obviously contribute to upward pressure on prices,&quot; Davy stockbrokers chief economist Jim O'Leary said.</p>
<p>&quot;It injects a lot of money into an economy that is already booming,&quot; Riada economist Dan McLaughlin added. &quot;The risks are all one way.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the first cut in standard income tax for five years and appeared to herald an early election for Prime Minister John Bruton's left-right coalition, which must call a poll by November this year, political sources said.</p>
<p>Initial market reaction was muted. Bond dealers said it was a damp squib because the cuts had been comprehensively leaked or anticipated.</p>
<p>Quinn said the generous 1997 tax cuts were the result of sound economic management which led to Gross National Product (GNP) growth of more than 14 percent since 1994. He said unemployment, Ireland's traditional economic black spot, had eased with a 14 percent fall in joblessness and the creation of 100,000 jobs or 8.5 pct of the workforce since 1994. He said the data showed &quot;the most dramatic economic and social development of our society since this State was established just 75 years ago. Ireland is now a national and international success story.&quot;</p>
<p>Ireland, he said, &quot;is becoming richer. Real wealth is being created by our continuous economic growth, which has been four times higher than the European average.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists said Quinn had the opportunity and the tidy finances to do something positive about spending this year if he wanted to take a long term view but he did not.</p>
<p>&quot;He could have used the buoyancy of the economy to run a budget surplus and I think that is what he should have been trying to do because we are not going to keep growing at this rate,&quot; O'Leary said.</p>
<p>Quinn pledged Ireland's commitment to be one of the first members of the European Union's economic and monetary union (EMU) and said the Dublin government would ensure that it met the Maastricht qualifying criteria.</p>
<p>He said the underlying general government deficit would be around 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1988 and 0.9 percent in 1999.</p>
<p>Quinn set the Exchequer borrowing target in 1997 at 637 million punts ($1.03 billion) against a 1996 outturn of 437 million. Economists' forecasts varied from 585 to 755 million.</p>
<p>Quinn said the 1996 current budget was in surplus by 292 million pounds against an expected deficit of 82 million punts thanks to healthy tax revenue and strong growth.</p>
<p>But Quinn acknowledged that inflation, currently averaging 1.6 percent annually, would rise next year to just over 2.0 percent, still within the Maastricht limits.</p>
<p>Ireland's independent Central Bank is reported to be concerned that the tax handouts might fuel a consumer spending boom which would fuel inflation and tarnish Ireland's Maastricht credentials. ($1=.6186 Punt)</p>
