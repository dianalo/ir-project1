<p>The worst floods in decades hit Bulgaria's Rodopi mountain region at the weekend, leaving two women dead and cutting off roads, rail links and power, civil defence officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The civil defence service has declared a state of emergency in the southern towns of Zlatograd, 260 km (160 miles) south of Sofia, and Nedlino, where dozens of houses were underwater.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 60 percent of Zlatograd is flooded and the population from the flooded area is being evacuated,&quot; a civil defence official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Emergency crews were also working in Kardjali, Devin and several other southern towns to repair damage caused by heavy rain which has swept the region in the past several days.</p>
<p>Four reservoirs in the same region were being closely monitored as some were nearing the critical levels at which they could overflow, said the official.</p>
