<headline>U.N. Rwanda tribunal says boosted by arrests.</headline>

<p>The U.N.'s Rwanda tribunal, dogged by allegations of mismanagement, said on Saturday it was boosted by the arrest of seven genocide suspects in the Kenyan capital and planned to open a second trial courtroom.</p>
<p>Seven suspects including Jean Kambanda, Rwanda's prime minister during the 1994 genocide, were arrested by Kenyan police working with tribunal officials in a series of dawn raids in Nairobi on Friday. They were transferred to tribunal headquarters in Arusha, northern Tanzania.</p>
<p>The arrests and the indictment of two of the seven suspects represents the biggest swoop by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).</p>
<p>&quot;There has been the idea that the tribunal is not going after the big fish. The operation of yesterday (Friday) will certainly put paid to that concept,&quot; tribunal registrar Nigerian Agwu Okali told a news conference.</p>
<p>The tribunal would open a second courtroom in August to enable it to run trials in parallel and was increasing to 50 the number of detention cells.</p>
<p>The ICTR was set up in November 1994 to bring to justice the leading architects of the Rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and some political moderate Hutus were killed.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hailed the arrests on Friday which he said &quot;demonstrate the determination of the international community to bring to justice those accused of perpetrating some of the worst crimes known to mankind.&quot;</p>
<p>Annan sacked two top tribunal officials in January after an internal report detailed financial mismanagement, nepotism and corruption.</p>
<p>The first of three trials started in January but trials have repeatedly been postponed and will not restart until September, tribunal officials say.</p>
<p>Twenty-three suspects have been indicted and the tribunal holds 19 in custody in Arusha.</p>
<p>Improved coordination since January between the tribunal's panel of judges, the prosecutor's and the registrar's office facilitated the arrests, Okali said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you judge performance you have to judge in the context of available facilities and resources. When we compare the work of the tribunal is doing within the (period) of its operation I think it is quite impressive,&quot; Okali said.</p>
<p>He denied any link between Friday's arrests and a visit to Nairobi on Wednesday by Rwanda's vice-president Major-General Paul Kagame and said the ICTR began detailed planning of the seizure operation months ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We hadn't the faintest idea that Kagame would be here on Wednesday. In fact we had to postpone our operation until Friday because the Kenyan police were more concerned about the success of the visit,&quot; ICTR deputy prosecutor Bernard Muna of Cameroon told the news conference.</p>
<p>Kenya's decision to grant safe haven to prominent Hutus connected to the regime of Rwanda's late president Juvenal Habyrimana soured relations with the Rwanda government which came to power in 1994.</p>
<p>Kagame said he discussed the issue with Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi on Wednesday, leading to speculation the arrests were part of a deal between the two countries over the suspects.</p>
<p>Rwanda has long maintained it wants Hutus returned for its own genocide trials at which at least 32 people have been sentenced to death. The ICTR's maximum penalty is life imprisonment.</p>
<p>The ICTR runs in parallel with the Hague-based criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, set up by the U.N. in 1993 as the first international body prosecuting war crimes since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after World War Two.</p>
