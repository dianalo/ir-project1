<p>Former South African captain Francois Pienaar and fellow World Cup hero Joel Stransky branded racist comments by ousted Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff as &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;sordid&quot; on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Markgraaff, who omitted both men from his tour side to Argentina, France and Wales, had his resignation accepted by the South African Rugby Football Union on Tuesday following comments he made about National Sports Council chairman Mluleki George during a taped telephone conversation.</p>
<p>Pienaar and Stransky, now playing club rugby in England, are both concerned about the negative impact of Markgraaff's comments, but are not getting carried away about a possible international recall against the British Lions later this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a serious blow to South African rugby. We spent a lot of time building up trust among the communities and now this happens,&quot; said Pienaar, who joined English first division club Saracens in December.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't make any sense out of it. But people must remember it is the irresponsible views of one person and not the views of the whole country, nor the views of the players.</p>
<p>&quot;Even so, the feeling over here now is going to be, have there actually been so many changes in sport in South Africa? It's a serious blow.&quot;</p>
<p>Stransky, who signed a two and a half year contract with European Cup finalists Leicester in January, was equally disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;This gives South African rugby rather a dark and sordid image at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The players put in a lot of time and effort in helping to get things moving by going into the townships and coaching the kids and this simply casts a lot of seriously dark clouds over the whole thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Markgraaff's fall, however, could ultimately benefit both Pienaar and Stransky and raise their hopes of playing for the Springboks again, perhaps against the British Lions in June and July.</p>
<p>Just over 18 months ago, at Ellis Park, Stransky dropped the goal which beat New Zealand in extra-time of the 1995 World Cup final. Pienaar collected the Webb Ellis Trophy from President Nelson Mandela who, in a move designed to unite the country, was wearing the captain's number six jersey.</p>
<p>But by the end of last season, with Markgraaff inheriting the coach's role from Kitch Christie, both men were out in the cold, overlooked for the Springbok's end-of-year tour to Argentina, France and Wales. They subsequently signed contracts with their English clubs</p>
<p>Pienaar's omission, in particular, was a matter of national controversy. He has made not hidden his desire to play for South Africa again but on Wednesday he was playing down his chances of a quick return.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't really thought about it, all of this has happened so quickly, but at this stage I don't really see myself being involved,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;All I can say is that I am a very loyal person and that the people here at Saracens have shown great faith in me and I intend to repay that.&quot;</p>
<p>Stransky, who lost his fly-half berth after a disastrous test against the All Blacks in Durban last year, was marginally more upbeat about his prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't really change anything, although I must admit, from a purely personal point of view, I am pretty happy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;When I made the decision to come over here (England) I logically put international rugby on the back burner although I always hoped that I might get the chance to play for South Africa again. I am always available if I am called up.</p>
<p>&quot;But that will be up to the new coach. I won't be going back to play provincial rugby in South Africa so if I am going to play against the Lions, I would have to be picked on my performances for Leicester.</p>
<p>&quot;If they don't want me I'll just enjoy a nice summer holiday instead.&quot;</p>
