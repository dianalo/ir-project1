<p>The opposition Labour Party's foreign affairs spokesman said on Monday it would be hard for Britain to stay out of the proposed single European currency in the long run.</p>
<p>Robin Cook, likely to be British foreign secretary if his party wins the general election that must be held by May, said a Labour decision to join the single currency would be taken if it was in the best interests of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be very difficult for Britain to stay out in the long run,&quot; Cook told BBC television in an interview.</p>
<p>He said that if the single currency became a success and Britain did not join, the pound would become a target for speculators and foreign investment in Europe would be directed at countries in the single currency area.</p>
<p>&quot;It may take some time to judge that effect, but in the long term it would be very difficult for Britain to stay out,&quot; Cook said.</p>
<p>This did not mean, however, that he was ruling out joining the single currency when it started in 1999. Labour would first have to look at the figures for the British economy in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We will make our decision on the basis of what is in the economic interest of the British people,&quot; Cook said.</p>
<p>Labour, like the ruling Conservatives, says it is keeping its options open on the single currency.</p>
<p>Supporters of a single currency see it as a way of building up the European Union's economic strength but opponents say it paves the way to loss of British sovereignty.</p>
<p>Labour and the Conservatives have promised a referendum if a future cabinet decides to take Britain in.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major, under pressure from anti-Europeans in his party, has all but ruled out entry into the single currency when it starts.</p>
<p>Cook, more sceptical about Europe than some of his Labour colleagues, said on Sunday there was only a 50 percent chance of Europe's single currency starting on time in 1999.</p>
