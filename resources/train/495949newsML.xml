<headline>Norfolk Southern sees rev growth from deal.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Norfolk Southern Corp on Wednesday outlined preliminary projections for its proposed partial acquisition of Conrail Inc, saying the deal would increase its revenues by nearly 50 percent.</p>
<p>In a brief conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Henry Wolf said the deal would be six percent dilutive to earnings per share in 1997 and 1998, five percent accretive in 1999, 10 percent accretive in 2000, and more than 15 percent accretive in 2001 and beyond.  </p>
<p>He said Norfolk sees synergies of $90 million in 1998, $220 million in 1999, and $350 million in 2000 and beyond.</p>
<p>CSX Corp and Norfolk Southern late Tuesday detailed the division of Conrail assets. The proposed $10.3 billion deal calls for Norfolk to pay $5.9 billion for 58 percent of the East Coast railroad, and CSX to pay $4.3 billion for the rest.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have, for the first time, the opportunity to develop a north-south market for both intermodal and conventional traffic and reach fertile new markets as yet untapped,&quot; Wolf said.  </p>
<p>Norfolk said it will finance the Conrail acquisition by issuing commercial paper and term debt.</p>
<p>&quot;We anticipate that the additional $5 billion in debt from our current level will bring our debt-to-total-capitalization to about 60 percent, which will allow us to remain solidly investment grade,&quot; Wolf said.</p>
<p>The railroad expects to book about $1.2 billion in goodwill and accounting from the planned acquisition.  </p>
<p>The deal also will enable Norfolk to become a major player in the east-west markets between the Midwest and the Northeast, leveraging its Kansas City gateway to provide transcontinental service to the East, Wolf said.</p>
<p>Analysts were not permitted to ask questions during the conference call. Wolf said more details will be available when Norfolk management meets with analysts in New York later this month.</p>
<p>CSX planned to conduct a similar conference call later today.</p>
<p>Separately, Norfolk said Wednesday that it had canceled its pending tender offer for Conrail. The move was a procedural one since CSX and Norfolk have agreed to form a joint entity to acquire all of Conrail's outstanding shares.</p>
<p>Shares of Norfolk were up 5/8 to 87-1/2.</p>
