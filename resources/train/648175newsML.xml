<p>German shares set fresh records in early trade on Monday amid relief at Friday's U.S. jobs data which seemed to indicate a brighter outlook for the U.S. economy, and a reduced risk of an imminent rate hike.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole interest rate story is looking positive right now,&quot; said a Frankfurt trader.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see the market making up much more ground than we have already but there is no reason for us to weaken either.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index was trading up 22.07 points at 3,717.36 points in the first half hour of floor trade, having slipped off an alltime high of 3,734.05 points hit in the pre-bourse electronic session.</p>
<p>Dealers said that while sentiment was generally positive and market factors encouraging, volumes were relatively thin and a lack of follow-up orders had prevented the market from holding all of its early gains.</p>
<p>A dearth of corporate news was a brake on the market, one dealer said, predicting that prices would hover at current levels through the day.</p>
<p>Analysts at Suedwestdeutsche Landesbank said that the DAX would hit its next resistance at 3,750 points.</p>
<p>Prices were tracking Wall Street's rally after a May jobs report was viewed as indicating a stable inflation and good growth outlook.</p>
<p>Retailer Karstadt AG was in demand, trading up eight marks at 628 marks, after a story that the WCM group was planning to buy a 25 percent stake in the retailer resurfaced in the Handelsblatt daily newspaper.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG, one of the banks reported in the German media to be ready to sell a stake in Karstadt, declined comment while Commerzbank AG reiterated that it was not aware of any such a plan.</p>
<p>With little solid corporate news due, the vexed question of monetary union was attracting market attention, as various top German politicians were expected to comment on the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;It was interesting to see what (Finance Minister Theo) Waigel had to say,&quot; said one dealer, referring to Waigel's comments this morning that reaffirmed Germany's commitment to meeting a three percent deficit to GDP ratio this year -- a goal seen as extremely difficult to fulfil.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot has to be cleared up on this point. People will be keeping a close eye on developments.&quot;</p>
