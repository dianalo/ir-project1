<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello's alleged disclosure of comments made to him privately by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan showed he was unfit to hold his position, Labor Opposition Deputy Leader and Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter Costello has shown today that he is simply not fit to be Australia's Treasurer after the appalling indiscretion that he committed in Washington,&quot; Evans told reporters.  </p>
<p>Costello was quoted by The Australian Financial Review newsaper after his meeting with Greenspan as saying that Greenspan was &quot;very optimistic&quot; on inflation. Costello also said he thought after the meeting that there was little expectation U.S. interest rates would rise, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The Treasurer later played down the validity of the report.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't comment on other countries' ... policies,&quot; Costello said when asked by Reuters about the article. When read portions of the report, Costello said &quot;that's fanciful.&quot;</p>
<p>A partial transcript of the comments broadcast on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio supported the newspaper story.  </p>
<p>Evans said Australia had been embarrassed by Costello's actions. &quot;How can he ever be trusted again with a confidence by any senior minister or senior bank official after his outrageous breach of faith,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Evans said that in his experience there had been a tradition of senior government officials talking about sensitive economic information in strict confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;The repurcussions for Australia are immense,&quot; Evans said.  </p>
<p>&quot;No Australian finance minister or treasurer is really going to be trusted ... If we can't have that kind of confidential relationship with senior policy makers elsewhere then our international reputatation is shot to pieces,&quot; Evans said.</p>
<p>The reports of Costello's comments helped boost the U.S. Treasury market on Tuesday.</p>
