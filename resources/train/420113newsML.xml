<headline>Fed looks at stocks in setting policy - Greenspan.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-05</dateline>

<p>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday said the central bank looked at stock prices to aid in setting policy but does not use monetary policy as a tool to &quot;prick the stock market bubble.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan, in remarks before a House Banking subcommittee in the second round of Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, repeated that if Wall Street is right in its assessment of corporate profit margins, stocks are properly priced.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We don't view monetary policy as a tool to ... prick the stock market bubble or something like that,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;What we do is look at a wide variety of things, income and consumption, assets and liabilities, combining them all to make judgements as to what it is one should be doing,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In discussing profit margins that companies are enjoying, he said that although it was possible that they could rise further, it was unclear whether that would be the case.</p>
<p>He also repeated that it was impossible for the Fed &quot;jawbone&quot; -- or talk -- the stock market up or down for any length of time.  </p>
<p>&quot;If profit margins continue to rise, as analysts on Wall Street expect them to, then the market is properly priced as best as we can judge on the basis of the level of where interest rates are,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
<p>But he added that if they don't go any further &quot;then the market will run into some difficutlty.&quot;</p>
