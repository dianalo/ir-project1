<p>Indonesia is expected to pass a broadcasting bill this month that could have a far-reaching impact on its radio, television and advertising industries and limit foreign participation, an MP said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now in the final stage of discussing the draft bill which was submitted by the government in March this year,&quot; Abu Hasan Sazili, chairman of the parliamentary committee on the broadcasting bill, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Under Indonesia's political system, parliament has the right to make changes to a bill submitted by the government, but any alterations are usually insignificant.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to pass it at our meeting on October 17 and then submit it back to the government for signing by President Suharto,&quot; Sazili said of the draft bill.</p>
<p>He noted the country had no previous broadcasting law.</p>
<p>&quot;The broadcasting law is likely to have a broad-based impact, not just on the traditional media like (television), but also on new technology like the internet,&quot; Sazili said.</p>
<p>If the internet were used to broadcast directly, he explained, it would fall under the bill.</p>
<p>The chairman said the legislation would sharply limit foreign participation in broadcasting and advertising in the medium.</p>
<p>&quot;Broadcasting is a very sensitive industry that could have significant impact, especially on our social and political values. That's why their (foreign) roles must be limited,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sazili said even the physical background of an advertisement should be Indonesian.</p>
<p>The draft bill stipulated that broadcast advertising should be produced by firms licensed by the government, using Indonesian scenery and Indonesian artists and Indonesian production partners.</p>
<p>He said that advertisements by foreign firms, such as Philip Morris Companies Inc's Marlboro cigarette advertisement which features cowboys, were likely to be affected.</p>
<p>Under the draft bill, private broadcasting firms will be banned from receiving foreign financial support. Technical and other assistance would be allowed only under government permits.</p>
<p>The bill, however, could pave the way for the country's largest television station, PT Bimantara Citra's Rajawali Citra Televisi Indonesia (RCTI), to float its shares on the local stock exchanges.</p>
<p>Bimantara's RCTI, controlled by President Suharto's son Bambang Trihatmojo, has wanted to list its shares on local exchanges for several years, but current regulations do not allow this, media analysts say.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, broadcasting firms would be able to raise funds from the capital market after obtaining government permission.</p>
<p>But RCTI and four other private stations may face stiff competition for advertising revenue, as the draft bill would allow state-owned Televisi Republik Indonesia (TVRI) to carry advertising.</p>
<p>TVRI is the oldest station and has a larger network and more extensive coverage than other stations.</p>
<p>The draft bill proposes penalties for violations of regulations of up to one billion rupiah ($430,000) and/or a prison term of up to 10 years.</p>
