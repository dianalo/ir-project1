<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Copel still a hold.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Local investment bank Banco Omega said in a report it has maintained its hold on common shares of Brazilian state-owned power firm Copel, known as Companhia Paranaense de Energia SA.</p>
<p>-- &quot;The commercial performance reported by Copel throughout the nine months of 1996 was fairly positive,&quot; the bank said, adding physical energy sales were expected to rise seven percent in 1997.  </p>
<p>-- Omega said Copel's outlook was clouded by doubts on when and how large a federal rate adjustment would be, and on the fact that Parana state, its majority owner, does not plan to privatize the company.</p>
<p>-- Parana nonetheless is keeping Copel's corporate structure competitive and able to face more aggressive competition, the bank added. It added that Copel is well-structured and has made heavy investments.</p>
<p>-- Omega said the state does plan to sell part of Copel's equity, reducing its share of voting stock to the 60 percent minimum limit from 85 percent today.  </p>
<p>-- Omega said it was maintaining its hold rating on Copel ordinary shares due to a mix of factors, among them: Parana retaining most of the shares, and the company's recovering operations, increased cash flow and favorable market conditions.</p>
<p>-- Copel common was up 0.05 real at 11.20 reais at 1302 local time/1002 EST on the Sao Paulo stock market.</p>
