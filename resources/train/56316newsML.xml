<p>Germany, deriding &quot;waverers, hesitators and delayers&quot;, said on Monday that there would be no easing in the entry rules for European monetary union (EMU) and the single currency would be launched on schedule in 1999.</p>
<p>Hitting out at recent press speculation over a secret deal to soften EMU entry criteria, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said: &quot;There will be no divergence from the stability criteria. Rumours of such considerations are totally baseless.&quot;</p>
<p>Kinkel was speaking after Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition voted key parts of a major austerity package into law last week, bidding to ensure Germany meets borrowing targets set by the Maastricht treaty to qualify for EMU in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The coalition continues to hold firm that currency union will come on the agreed date of January 1, 1999. Waverers, hesitators and delayers must not have a chance,&quot; Kinkel said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe cannot be sold out to the sceptics,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Top German finance officials meet their French counterparts on Tuesday and are likely to try and spur them to make painful budget savings to help France meet the entry terms for EMU next year -- which is judgement year under the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>The meeting of the Franco-German economic council, in the Bavarian town of Kempten, is sandwiched between budget talks in Paris and Bonn and a meeting this week of European Union finance officials in Ireland to discuss the single currency.</p>
<p>Maastricht's key stipulations include holding budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product and keeping total government borrowing under 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>And while Germany is aiming to get its deficit down to just 2.5 percent of GDP in 1997, the French government, which presents its budget on Wednesday, is showing signs of flagging.</p>
<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer last week warned that juggling budget figures to achieve a one-off qualification for EMU next year could store up problems for later.</p>
<p>&quot;What is decisive is whether countries can prove that they will be able to maintain fiscal discipline in the long term,&quot; Tietmeyer said.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer's remarks did, however, appear to diverge from the standard German line by offering some scope for flexibility in the interpretation of Maastricht's key clauses on the deficit and borrowing limits.</p>
