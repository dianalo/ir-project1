<p>Norway is likely to tighten monetary policy and raise short-term interest rates by the end of the year as the crown continues to weaken, Handelsbanken Markets said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a new forecast, Handelsbanken projected the crown to fall to around 104.50 against the inverse European Currency Unit (ECU) index over the next six months. The crown is currently fluctuating between 101.80 and 102 versus the index.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the bank saw the crown declining to 4.35 in a six-month timeframe compared with a current 4.16.</p>
<p>Handelsbanken attributed the petrocurrency's rapid depreciation from four-year highs at the beginning of 1997 to international investors withdrawing on fears of inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not that the slightly higher inflation is so terrible; it is just that it has demoted the Norwegian crown from superhero to everyday status. Therefore international investors have no reason the give special attention to the Norwegian crown anymore,&quot; Handelsbanken said.</p>
<p>&quot;As the crown continues to weaken, Norges Bank eventually should see fit to raise short-term rates again, for example, when the ECU index passes 104.&quot;</p>
<p>Furthermore the German Bundesbank is expected to raise its rates in reaction to the weak but steady, export-led recovery sometime after the end of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We find it hard to pinpoint the timing between the German rate hike and a separate move by Norges Bank. Eventually, however, we believe Norges Bank will be forced to raise Norwegian interest rates by 50 to 75 basis points over and above the German move.</p>
<p>&quot;A total increase in the Norwegian short rate of 125 points thus does not seem unreasonable,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The bank revised downwards its estimate for 1997 inflation to 2.7 percent from 3.2 percent and lowered its forecast for wage growth to 4.2 percent from 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>However, it estimated inflation to grow by 3.7 percent in 1998 and by 4.3 percent in 1999.</p>
