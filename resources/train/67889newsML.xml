<p>Belgian chemicals group Solvay SA said on Friday it would spend the proceeds from the sale of its animal health businesses on acquiring human pharmaceutical product lines or companies in the U.S.</p>
<p>Solvay on Friday said it would sell its worldwide animal health businesses to American Home Products Corp for 14 billion Belgian francs ($448.8 million) , netting it a pre-tax capital gain of around six billion francs.</p>
<p>Together with a one billion Deutsche mark credit line renewed with a number of European banks last month, the group has reserves of around one billion dollars at its disposal.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not looking, except if an extraordinary opportunity arises, for one mega-acquisition...For the moment we are working on selective acquisitions...in therapeutic areas where we are strong,&quot; Solvay chief executive officer Daniel Janssen told a news conference.</p>
<p>Janssen noted Solvay's share of the pharmaceuticals market in Europe was more than one percent in 1995 but only 0.3 percent in the U.S.. &quot;We want to grow much faster in the U.S,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Juergen Ernst, director of Solvay's health business, said Solvay was the European and world leader in anti-spasmodic drugs in 1995 with market shares of 38.4 and 19.6 percent.</p>
<p>But in North America its share of the anti-spasmodics market was one percent, ranking it 14th. It was a similar story in other market segments, he said.</p>
<p>Janssen said Solvay had already made some unannounced U.S. acquisitions this year and would continue to investigate opportunites as they arose. &quot;But don't expect by the end of the year to see anything spectacular,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ernst said that as well as looking for new businesses Solvay, which had the world's 44th largest drugs business in 1995, was also concentrating on new products and markets.</p>
<p>Luvox, the company's best-selling obsessive compulsive disorder drug launched on the U.S. last year, should be authorised and ready for sale in Japan &quot;in the second half of 1998,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sales of Luvox amounted to $78 million in the first six months of 1996 and Solvay &quot;would be surprised if we don't make more than $150 million&quot; for the full year, he said.</p>
<p>Solvay was also in advanced clinical trials for treatments against other anxiety complaints and life-threatening heart conditions, Ernst said.</p>
<p>It was also monitoring developments in gene therapy.</p>
<p>Solvay human health sales overall amounted to 34 billion Belgian francs ($1.165 billion) in 1995 out of total group sales of 273 billion francs ($9.284 billion).</p>
<p>Janssen said the roughly eight billion in sales that Solvay will lose, from 1997, by selling the animal health business to AHP will not be greatly noticed by the group.</p>
<p>&quot;Our objective is not to have very big sales. Our objective is to have big and growing profits,&quot; he added.</p>
