<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine stocks close firm on selective buying.</title>
<headline>Argentine stocks close firm on selective buying.</headline>

<text>
<p>Argentine stocks closed firm Wednesday on selective buying, though the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave rates unchanged had been mainly discounted, dealers said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index which has been finding resistance at 830 points and support at 800, was 0.69 percent higher at 824.11 by Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was selective with buying interest centered on local stocks with little weight on international markets,&quot; said Augusto Milou of Galicia Valores. &quot;The lack of action by the Fed means dealers have got more freedom to maneuver now.&quot;  </p>
<p>Volume was slimmer at 29.2 million pesos compared to 36.6 million in Tuesday's active session.</p>
<p>Trading in Telefonica de Argentina was hit by news that a federal judge fined the company backdated to March for failing to bill clients because of the row over a new tariff structure.</p>
<p>Telefonica's ADR fell half a percentage point early in the session but closed only 0.18 percent off. The stock in Buenos Aires closed a marginal 0.57 percent higher at 3.51 pesos, but was much more thinly traded than usual, dealers said.</p>
