<title>LATVIA: Olainfarm bounces back on Latvian bourse.</title>
<headline>Olainfarm bounces back on Latvian bourse.</headline>
<dateline>RIGA 1997-06-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Latvian shares eased in sluggish trade on Monday with turbulent newcomer Olainfarm accounting for half of market volume as it bounced back once again.</p>
<p>&quot;Summer is not the best time for the bourse, although the new companies, and some of the new ones which will be listed soon, should help increase interest,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Overall market volume was 80,000 lats and the Rietumu index fell 1.79 percent to 149.4.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical producer Olainfarm remained volatile, jumping 14.8 percent to 2.40 lats in trade of 40,100 lats.</p>
<p>Dealers have been divided about the company's prospects and profitability since its bourse debut a week ago.</p>
<p>Hansa Investments, which brought the company to the market, says it is very profitable and maintains its poor first quarter results stemmed from accounting losses and tax liabilities.</p>
<p>A number of local dealers have been less generous in their assessment and claim that the stock, which has bounced up and down, is overpriced.</p>
<p>Confectionery producer Staburadze was the lone gainer on the official list, rising 0.4 percent to 2.70 lats in trade of 26,700 lats.</p>
<p>Trade was slow elsewhere on the market.</p>
<p>Two companies, Liepaja Oil and Riga Jewellery, were quoted for the first time, at 0.50 lats and 0.80 lats respectively. No shares were swapped in either firm.</p>
<p>Unibanka lost ground on the official list, falling 3.1 percent to 3.12 lats in trade of 3,700 lats.</p>
