<title>FRANCE: Rich world works on debt relief for poor.</title>

<p>Rich nations have begun working out the nuts and bolts of a new debt relief scheme designed to lift the burden of debt from some of the world's poorest nations.</p>
<p>A World Bank statement on Friday said representatives from major industrialised countries and multilateral institutions had met in Paris on Thursday to discuss implementing the scheme, agreed in September at the annual IMF/World Bank annual meeting.</p>
<p>Countries which may benefit first include Bolivia, Guyana and Uganda, a source close to the talks said.</p>
<p>Under the scheme, countries which have followed economic policies approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for three years will be eligible for enhanced debt relief from the Paris Club of creditor nations.</p>
<p>The IMF and World Bank will also act at the same time to reduce debt owed to them, with the aim of bringing total debt to all creditors down to sustainable levels.</p>
<p>The talks on Thursday aimed to decide how to implement the joint effort &quot;and ensure that countries gain access to the benefits of the initiative as quickly as possible&quot;, the World Bank statement said.</p>
<p>World Bank and IMF experts have so far begun so-called &quot;debt sustainability analyses&quot; on five countries which have completed a three-year IMF programme and therefore could be eligible for the enhanced debt relief.</p>
<p>These five are Bolivia, Guyana, Uganda, Burkina Faso and Mali. The last two however were judged in a preliminary assessment earlier this year to have sustainable levels of debt, suggesting only the first three would be eligible.</p>
<p>The debt sustainability analyses are likely to be completed in the next few months, the source said. If these proved that certain countries did indeed face unsustainable levels of debt, they would then get enhanced debt relief from the Paris Club, World Bank and IMF, provided they continued to follow IMF-backed economic policies.</p>
<p>Other countries which may become eligible next year for improved debt relief are Ivory Coast, Mozambique and Ethiopia, all of which were judged to be &quot;possibly stressed&quot; in the preliminary IMF/World Bank assessment.</p>
<p>Some of the world's very poorest countries may be unable to benefit from the scheme if they have not reached agreement with the IMF on economic restructuring.</p>
<p>The aim is to help those who are following approved policies but for whom all the gains of economic growth are eaten up by debt service charges.</p>
