<p>Barrick Gold Corp said on Friday that it has appointed John Carrington as president and chief operating officer of the company.</p>
<p>Carringotn also becomes a member of the board of directors, Barrick said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bob Smith, who has been president since 1987, becomes vice-chairman and will focus on Barrick's development strategy.</p>
<p>Carrington was responsible for integrating the mines acquired from Lac Minerals Ltd into Barrick's operations, chief executive Peter Munk said in the statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;He has also focused our attention on the importance of innovative thinking at our mines, and increased operating efficiency,&quot; Munk said.</p>
<p>Carrington, 53, will be responsible for Barrick's mining operations and the overall management of the company's direction.</p>
<p>He joined Barrick in January 1995 as executive vice-president of operations. He was made chief operating officer in January 1996.</p>
<p>Smith is leaving the president role because he wanted to spend less time in the office, Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;He's decided to take a less onerous role and focus on development strategy,&quot; Borg explained.</p>
