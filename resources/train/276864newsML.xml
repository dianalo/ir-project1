<p>China has shut down almost 57,000 small polluting factories in a bid to curb damage caused by rapid economic growth to the environment, the Legal Daily said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Environmental authorities closed 56,866 factories, or 80.5 percent of those blacklisted, by November 22, the newspaper said but did not give an account of the remaining enterprises and whether closures would continue.</p>
<p>Most of the small enterprises hit by the drive produced paper, fertilisers, electroplates or extracted sulphur, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The closures followed an anti-pollution campaign that ended on June 30, in which authorities in four provinces shut down 999 small polluting paper mills along the Huaihe river, it said.</p>
<p>Rivers and lakes across China are lined with tens of thousands of factories, many of which have little or no waste water treatment facilities.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 environmental officials have fanned out across China to inspect factories and close down polluting ones after the State Council, or cabinet, issued an edict in August to step up environmental protection.</p>
<p>China's environmental problems have worsened over the past decade with the economy's rapid development, and some of the world's highest levels of air pollution have been recorded in Chinese cities, where acid rain is common.</p>
