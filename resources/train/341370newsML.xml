<title>INDIA: Most of Templeton India fund in cash, money market.</title>
<headline>Most of Templeton India fund in cash, money market.</headline>

<p>Almost 98 percent of the funds raised by Templeton's maiden Indian mutual fund has been invested in cash and money market instruments upto December 1996, the fund said.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently a little under 98 percent of the assets of the fund are held in cash and money market instruments,&quot; J. Mark Mobius, director of Templeton Asset Management (India) Pvt Ltd said in the firm's latest communication to its investors.</p>
<p>The note was received by investors on Wednesday. Templeton Asset Management (India) Pvt Ltd is the Indian subsidiary of Franklin Templeton, a leading U.S. fund manager.</p>
<p>Vijay Advani, the fund's chief executive officer said the picture has since changed, but declined to reveal the amount invested in equities.</p>
<p>&quot;It's getting substantially invested in stocks,&quot; he told Reuters. He said the fund size had risen to 760 million rupees from 500 million in August 1996. The Templeton India Growth Fund became open-ended from November 1996.</p>
<p>Templeton in its August offer document had said it expected to invest about 85 percent of its corpus in equity and equity-related instruments and the balance in debt and money market instruments.</p>
<p>ITC-Threadneedle Asset Management Company, a joint venture between India's ITC Classic Finance and Threadneedle of U.K., said most of its investments were in equities.</p>
<p>Both Templeton and ITC-Threadneedle had launched their maiden Indian mutual funds in August 1996 at a time when stock prices across India were at a low.</p>
<p>Both Templeton and ITC-Threadneedle officials said they believed the current rally in Indian stock markets is largely speculator-driven.</p>
<p>&quot;It is largely speculative and built on hopes of sops from the prime minister,&quot; said Ajay Srinivasan, chief investment officer at ITC-Threadneedle.</p>
<p>Templeton's Advani agreed. &quot;It's more of a hype. Nothing has fundamentally changed in the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on Monday said new economic policy measures would be announced before he and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram went to Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 31.</p>
<p>In Templeton's communication to investors, Mobius said he expected &quot;rapid economic growth to drive sharp increases in earnings and in equity prices.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As valuations are already looking excellent for many stocks on Indian bourses, we will be looking to increase our exposure to stock markets significantly over the next few months in anticipation of price gains,&quot; he said.</p>
