<p>Australian-based pallet hire and logistics group Brambles Industries Ltd loaded up another strong first-half profit rise on Friday, but was quick to warn investors not to expect such strength in the second half.</p>
<p>Brambles chief executive John Fletcher said slow European and Australian economies, along with a smaller boost from lower net interest costs, would slow growth in the second half.</p>
<p>Fletcher told Reuters analysts should not get too excited by a better-than-expected first-half result and should hold on to the full-year profit forecasts they made before the result.</p>
<p>&quot;The message is that the existing market expectations for the full year that were there before this announcement, they're still looking okay,&quot; Fletcher said.</p>
<p>He said the average of the Barceps survey of analysts' forecasts for the 1996/97 year to June 30 was A$240.3 million (US$186.2 million)</p>
<p>This would be a near 12 percent rise for the full year on the A$214.8 million pre-abnormal net profit posted in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Earlier, Brambles reported its first-half net profit before abnormals rose 14.8 percent to A$117.2 million.</p>
<p>There were no abnormal profits or losses in the period.</p>
<p>Brambles also raised its dividend to 35 cents a share from 34 cents.</p>
<p>Fletcher said the higher profit reflected strong growth in North America and higher earnings despite difficult conditions in Australia and Europe.</p>
<p>Revenue fell A$145 million to A$1.454 billion in the half.</p>
<p>&quot;Lower net interest resulting from the proceeds of the sale of under-performing activities in Australia and Europe, and lower interest rates, also contributed to the overall improvement,&quot; Fletcher said.</p>
<p>Net interest expenses fell to A$22.3 million from A$32.3 million in the half because debt was repaid after asset sales.</p>
<p>Brambles said its Australian units continued to perform sluggishly overall, &quot;with little evidence of an improvement in those areas of the economy in which the company operates&quot;.</p>
<p>Subdued economic conditions in continental Europe continued to affect growth from Brambles' European activites, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;But this was offset by the good gains achieved by the CHEP (pallet hire) and Cleanaway joint ventures,&quot; Brambles said.</p>
<p>Brambles' CHEP joint venture is with Britain's GKN Plc.</p>
<p>Brambles said it experienced good profit growth from its U.S. activities.</p>
<p>Earnings before interest, tax and abnormals at U.S. operations rose to A$26.2 million in the half from A$17.8 million in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;If only I had three Americas,&quot; Fletcher said.</p>
<p>Brambles said it was talking to General Electric Capital and General Electric Plastics about the supply and leasing of plastic pallets in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>It said it had worked with various parties on the development of a plastic pallet, but had yet to find a pallet as strong, durable or cheap as wood.</p>
<p>Fletcher told Reuters that Brambles was a lot closer to finding an acceptable plastic pallet this year than in previous years. &quot;We could be within 12 months of finding something,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brambles shares closed unchanged on Friday at A$21.70, after having earlier risen to an intra-day high of A$21.94.</p>
<p>(A$ = US$0.77)</p>
