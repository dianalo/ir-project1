<headline>Indonesian courts release all Megawati supporters.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1996-11-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Indonesian judges on Wednesday ordered the release of all 124 supporters of opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri who had been arrested four months ago in connection with riots in Jakarta, lawyers said.</p>
<p>Delivering 10 separate judgments, judges in the Central Jakarta State Court acquitted nine of the accused and sentenced the other 115 to time already served in custody, the lawyers said.  </p>
<p>All 124 were taken into custody after police raided the headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) on July 27 to evict supporters of Megawati who had barricaded themselves within. Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership by a government-backed faction in June.</p>
<p>The raid led to the worst riots in Jakarta in over two decades. At least five people died in the violence.</p>
<p>The 124 were charged with disobeying police orders and assault. The judges acquitted all the accused on charges of assault and convicted all but nine for refusing to leave the headquarters. They were sentenced to four months imprisonment.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers said the 115 who were partially convicted would appeal in the High Court.</p>
