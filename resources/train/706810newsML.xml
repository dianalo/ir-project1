<p>Australia are awaiting the result of a scan on reserve wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist's injured knee before deciding whether to send him home, coach Geoff Marsh said on Friday.</p>
<p>Another team official had said earlier that Gilchrist was definitely flying home to Australia but Marsh said the player would undergo examination at a Manchester hospital before a final decision was made.</p>
<p>Gilchrist, who injured remedial ligaments during practice for the third test at Old Trafford, has had little chance to make an impression on the tour, playing only one innings.</p>
<p>But he played on the previous tour of South Africa as a specialist batsman and there had been suggestions that he might be brought into the test team in that role if Michael Bevan failed again.</p>
<p>Bevan made only seven in the third test on Thursday and has scored just 43 in four test innings.</p>
