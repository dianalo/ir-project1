<p>South Korean stocks closed sharply higher on Wednesday as broad optimism about an economic recovery kept sentiment buoyant, brokers said.</p>
<p>The optimism, renewed on Tuesday by brisk June trade balance figures, has combined with ample liquidity resulting from the slowdown in capital investments by companies, they said.</p>
<p>Analysts saw the market rising another 15-20 percent this year, particularly since the foreign ownership ceiling is due to be expanded for the second time this year in the second half.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the composite index closed up 2.54 percent, or 19.26 points, to 777.29.  </p>
<p>In June, South Korea recorded the first monthly trade surplus in 30 months of $97.6 million, against a $426 million deficit a year earlier.</p>
<p>Provisional trade ministry figures showed exports rose 9.2 percent year-on-year in June for the third consecutive month, while exports increased by 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy now appears to have passed the worst point and the liquidity remains ample. These and other technical factors are expected to keep the market bullish for a while,&quot; said Shim Choong-bo, research manager at Daishin Securities.  </p>
<p>Heavily export-reliant sectors and securities firms led gains on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Shipping firms rose on hopes that their earnings would increase in line with the recovery in exports. The sector's sub-index closed up 5.92 percent to 565.56.</p>
<p>Shares of securities firms gained as investors believed the falling interest rates and the stock market's rally would boost earnings of brokerage firms.</p>
<p>Ssangyong Motor closed up 410 won at its daily limit of 5,540 won on news that its main creditor bank approved the company's application for a 20 billion won loan.  </p>
<p>Chohung Bank said it had supplied another 20 billion won to the debt-ridden vehicle maker by purchasing commercial papers issued by Ssangyong.</p>
<p>September index futures gained 1.70 points to 84.10 and the underlying KOSPI-200 index rose 2.35 points to 81.63.</p>
