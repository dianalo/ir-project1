<p>Vietnam's export rice market has remained very quiet this week as buyers look to supplies from other countries, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Only six vessels were currently loading in Saigon Port with shipments bound for Iraq, Iran, West Africa, Cuba and an undisclosed destination.</p>
<p>Five percent broken grade was quoted at around $280 per tonne or less FOB Saigon Port, while 10 percent grade was being offered at around $270 per tonne, down slightly from a week earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's down right now. It's been like this for a month,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Dealers said buyers appeared to be focusing on Pakistan and Thailand in preference to Vietnam.</p>
<p>An official with Vietnam's Northern Food Corporation, Vinafood 1, said on Thursday that Hanoi was in discussions with Baghdad to supply rice as repayment in kind for debt. He was unable to provide details of the amount.</p>
<p>Wednesday's Saigon Times newspaper quoted visiting Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh as saying that the two countries could exchange food for oil once the United Nations embargo on Iraq was eased.  </p>
<p>The debt, the size of which has not been disclosed, stems from aid given by Baghdad to Hanoi during the Vietnam War.</p>
