<p>Frightened civilians have fled a fresh outbreak of fighting between Nigerian troops and soldiers loyal to Sierra Leone's military rulers near the capital Freetown, witnesses said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The cause of the clash at Djui, which began late on Saturday 15 miles (20 km) south east of the city and near Hastings airport, was not clear.</p>
<p>Residents said crossfire between Nigerian troops and the newly constituted People's Army -- soldiers who backed a May 25 coup and rebel allies -- had killed at least eight civilians.</p>
<p>Sierra Leonean military officials said shooting continued on Sunday. They accused Nigerian troops at a nearby base of starting the clash and said soldiers and civilians had been hospitalised in Waterloo to the southeast.</p>
<p>Nigerian commanders were unavailable for immediate comment.</p>
<p>The two sides clashed last Wednesday at Lungi airport across an estuary from the capital as members of the People's Army hunted for a clandestine radio station that has broadcast messages from ousted president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.</p>
<p>Nigeria, which had troops in the country under a defence pact before the coup, has since reinforced as part of efforts to persuade the military junta to restore Kabbah to power.</p>
<p>Impoverished Sierra Leone's West African neighbours have agreed to try dialogue and economic sanctions as methods of persuasion but have retained the military option.</p>
<p>Kabbah came to power in 1996 after multi-party elections ended four years of military rule. Rebels, who took up arms in 1991, rallied to the coup -- the third in five years.</p>
