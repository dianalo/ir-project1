<p>Three former executive directors of state-owned Mineralbank, declared insolvent ten days ago, were detained on charges of misappropriation of funds, state radio said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Security Service (NSS) has collected evidence for committed crime in Mineralbank and the executive directors Vladimir Tashkov, Kiril Nikolov and Roumen Kasabov were detained,&quot; said the radio.</p>
<p>The bank has illegaly extended credits to individuals and companies worth 100 billion levs since 1990, said the NSS quoted by the radio.</p>
<p>The Sofia City Court declared Mineralbank insolvent at the request of the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) last week. The BNB placed Mineralbank in receivership on May 17, 1996 due to a danger of insolvency, dismissed its management and appointed sequestrators.</p>
<p>Former central bank deputy governor and current owner of financial consultancy firm Emil Harsev will also be prosecuted and a five million lev bail was set for him, the radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;To this moment I have not been invited for discussion or questioning. No one has contacted me so far,&quot; Harsev said in a radio interview. He was also member of Mineralbank's board until August 95.</p>
<p>The prosecutor's office was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Ivan Tatarchev said earlier this week that members of Mineralbank's former management will be prosecuted for misappropriation of funds.</p>
<p>Last June Mineralbank failed to honour maturity payments on seven-year samurai bonds worth a total of five billion yen issued in 1989 with the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ) being the lead arranger for the issue.</p>
<p>Mineralbank's total debts to foreign banks amount to $240 million, including $150 million of bonds and loans owed to the banks grouped in the IBJ.</p>
<p>Before the insolvency announcement Banque National de Paris had shown interest in buying a stake in Mineralbank, where the government holds 80 percent, resident bankers said.</p>
<p>Mineralbank is the first large state-owned local bank ruled insolvent out of 16 banks for which the BNB has sought insolvency.</p>
<p>Mineralbank, set up as an investment bank by Bulgaria's former communist regime in the 1980s, had racked up losses of 8.6 billion levs by the end of 1995, its annual report showed. -- Elisaveta Konstantinova, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561</p>
