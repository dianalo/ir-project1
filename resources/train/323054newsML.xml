<title>SINGAPORE: Asia Gas Oil/Jet - Diesel price in free fall.</title>

<p>Gas oil prices were in a free-fall as sellers offered aggressively below $26.00 per barrel while buyers waited for levels to slump further, traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom is not in sight and buyers have disappeared,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The market is now looking at India and Indonesia to help curb the slide even though most of their requirements would come from the Middle East, as China faded away from the market, traders said.  </p>
<p>China's attempt to default on their earlier purchases, which were done at very high prices, were also spooking the market, they said.</p>
<p>Traders said a local trader with distressed cargoes off China was now planning to move their tankers to Singapore.</p>
<p>But traders said the scheduled maintenance shutdown of an 18,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) fluid catalytic cracker at India's Bombay Petroleum Corp refinery for 30 days in February might fulfill market expectations of a large award in Indian Oil Corp's gas oil import tender for March deliveries.</p>
<p>The tender closes on January 23.  </p>
<p>Gas oil swaps breached $26.00 a barrel to be offered late in the day at $25.00/$25.20 for February, down from $26.50/$26.75 on Monday. March was quoted at $25.30/$25.50 down from Tuesday's $27.00/$27.10 earlier.</p>
<p>The plunge was reflected in the physical market when a local trader lowered his offer of 150,000 barrels for Feb 11-15 lifting to $25.50 free-on-board (fob) basis, from $26.50 earlier.  </p>
<p>A European major also offered to as low as $25.80 for a 30,000-tonne cargo lifting Feb 15-19. But buyers were sidelined. Jet fuel also slipped along with the weakness seen in the middle-distillate complex. But China was said to have bought a total of 65,000 tonnes of jet fuel recently at a premium of $1.90 per barrel to Singapore spot quotes, cost-and-freight basis.  </p>
