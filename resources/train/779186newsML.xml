<p>U.S. spot natural gas prices closed the gap with futures Tuesday, resulting in another significant gain in most cash markets, sources said.</p>
<p>On the Louisiana Gulf Coast, swing prices at the Henry Hub were quoted up an average of seven cents to about $2.30-2.35 as utility buyers re-emerged for additional supplies.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, futures and cash were for the most part in convergence as September futures traded around $2.34-2.35.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, swing prices soared into the mid-$2.20s, gaining about 10 cents from Monday. Chicago city-gate gas prices were up an equal amount to about $2.40.</p>
<p>In the Permian Basin market, prices rose another 10 cents to $2.25-2.26 in tandem with surging electricity prices due to the heat.</p>
<p>Prices in Palo Verde for next-day delivery peak loads were quoted at $55.00-65.00 per megawatt hour, up about $20 from Monday.</p>
<p>Triggering the onslaught of buying interest in the West were temperature highs topping 100 degrees F in many parts of the region.</p>
<p>San Juan basin gas was also several cents higher at $2.20-2.23, while southern California border prices soared to about $2.40-2.41.</p>
<p>The strength in the Gulf and Midcontinent markets filtered into the eastern market areas, traders said. As a result, the New York city gate market shrugged off cooler-than-normal weather by climbing to the low-$2.50s, from the low-to-mid $2.40s on Monday.</p>
