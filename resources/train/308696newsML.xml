<p>Argentina's $2.0 billion global bond is expected to be launched on January 21 or 22 following completion of the issuer's roadshows, joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said Wednesday.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan is the other joint lead.</p>
<p>The two-tranche issue will offer maturities of five and 20 years.</p>
<p>Pricing has not yet been set, but bankers said they expect the five-year tranche to pay some 300-325 basis points over comparable Treasuries and the 20-year tranche to pay roughly 500 basis points over the benchmark.</p>
<p>Argentina is rated B1 by Moody's Investors Service and BB-minus by Standard and Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>The 20-year tranche is the longest dollar bond ever issued by Argentina. It sold 30-year bonds denominated in German marks last year.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch and Argentine officials were finishing up the Asian roadshow with a presentation in Hong Kong on Wednesday after visiting Seoul and Taipei earlier this week.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch said that 50 to 80 investors attended each of the Asian roadshows, with both commercial banks and institutional investors represented.</p>
<p>Joaquin Cottani, Argentina's financial representative in the U.S., said this US$2.0 billion issue and US$2.0 billion saved from 1996 borrowing will satisfy about 40 percent of Argentina's planned US$8.5 billion borrowing through foreign debt issues in 1997.</p>
<p>Many attending the Asian roadshows would be first-time investors in Argentine fixed-rate paper, Cottani said.</p>
<p>Asian investors, which tend to prefer shorter-dated paper, are expected to participate in the five-year tranche.</p>
<p>Roadshows will be held in Frankfurt and London starting on Thursday and a New York roadshow will be completed next Tuesday. Launch is expected soon after the New York roadshow.</p>
