<p>A top Intel Corp. official said Wednesday the company's chip factories were running full tilt, a sign of strong demand for computers and other high-tech gear.</p>
<p>The comments by Intel Executive Vice President Gerhard Parker sent shares of the world's largest chip maker soaring 6 percent in an otherwise down stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;My factories are full,&quot; Parker, who oversees Intel's technology and manufacturing, told investors at a Montgomery Securities conference here. &quot;We are running pedal to the metal right now. That presumably means sales are pretty robust.&quot;</p>
<p>Parker also said Intel was cutting more costs out of its manufacturing processes than it had originally expected.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said the combination of full production and lower costs was good news not only for Intel but for the personal computer industry as a whole because Intel supplies the vast majority of the chips used by PC makers.</p>
<p>&quot;Intel tells you what's going on in the PC industry,&quot; said Chicago Corp. analyst David Wu. &quot;If Intel is doing well, the PC industry should be doing well because they are using their chips.&quot;</p>
<p>Last month Intel told investors revenues for the fourth quarter would be significantly above the $5.14 billion generated in the third quarter and gross margins -- a key indicator of profitability -- would top 57 percent.</p>
<p>Some analysts said, however, that Intel's guidance may have been too conservative.</p>
<p>&quot;I think their view of the fourth quarter and next year is even more bullish now than when they put out that statement,&quot; said Robertson Stephens analyst Dan Niles. &quot;Intel is having a blockbuster year and next year looks even better.&quot;</p>
<p>Niles said Intel's gross margins could top 60 percent in the fourth quarter and revenues could rise above $6 billion.</p>
<p>Intel stock jumped $7.75 to $136.875 on Nasdaq while the Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues, fell 3.43 points to 1,309.12.</p>
<p>Intel, maker of the popular Pentium and Pentium Pro processors, has grown steadily due to strong demand for its chips, which power about 90 percent of the world's personal computers.</p>
<p>Parker said PC demand looked healthy, and noted that Intel generally agreed with a foreacst by outside research firm Dataquest Inc. that the PC market will grow about 18 percent next year.</p>
<p>Drew Peck, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Co, said Intel normally chooses its words carefully, so Parker's upbeat comments should be regarded as a sign the company feels comfortable about demand.</p>
<p>He said, however, it was too soon to know how computer sales will fare during the important holiday season.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of PCs were built in anticipation of a very healthy consumer selling period over the holidays. If that doesn't materialise, as it did not last year, then we could be saddled with some excess inventories and the first quarter could be quite a bit slower,&quot; Peck said.</p>
<p>Even if the first quarter is slow, an onslaught of new technology next year should keep PC sales healthy overall, he added.</p>
<p>Intel's most popular product is the Pentium chip. Several times a year it reduces the price of the Pentium chips in a bid to boost sales. To allow the price cuts, Intel aims for 30 percent production cost savings for Pentium chips each year.</p>
<p>Parker said Intel was currently ahead of that 30 percent cost savings goal, through efficiencies and higher yields.</p>
<p>Intel was using all its chip-making capacity, Parker said, and was taking steps to squeeze 10 percent more production from existing plants including limited new investments.</p>
