<p>Utah Medical Products Inc expects a new device it is developing to assess fetal distress by measuring pH or acidity levels will set a new standard for prenatal care, chairman and chief executive officer Kevin Cornwell said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The device, which if approved would be a new version of its existing Intran heart monitoring device, should &quot;set the stage for another round of high growth,&quot; Cornwell told the Cruttenden Roth Growth stock Conference here.  </p>
<p>Along with monitoring amniotic fluid, the new system is designed to measure pH levels, which help doctors assess whether a fetus' lungs and heart are functioning properly. The previous system did not measure pH levels.</p>
<p>Cornwell said this system would be a more precise indicator of fetal distress, which could help reduce the number of unwarranted caesarian section deliveries.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that physicians will not deliver babies without this information once the system is proven accurate,&quot; Cornwell said.  </p>
<p>Although he did not say when the company would be ready to apply for marketing approval, Cornwell did say he expected it would qualify for a rapid review by the Food and Drug Administration. He said it posed no safety concerns different from the existing Intran devices, and offered more accurate readings of a fetus, meaning it &quot;can not be less efficacious&quot; than those already on the market.</p>
