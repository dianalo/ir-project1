<p>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) said on Monday a vote by unions to call a nationwide 24-hour strike of BHP steelworkers in protest at the planned shut-down of the Newcastle steel works was a regrettable decision.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand the emotion associated with this issue and we are putting all our efforts into a successful transition of Newcastle and into ensuring that our strategies for building the steel business are successful,&quot; a BHP spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike isn't going to change the reality we face in this business.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We think it would be more constructive for all parties to direct efforts towards supporting the transition process already underway in Newcastle and to ensuring the conditions are in place for a world class steel business,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) earlier said the strike, to be held on May 15, was confined to BHP steel and associated workers but could be widened to other parts of BHP.</p>
<p>BHP announced last week a wide-ranging restructure of its steel division, including the closure of its Newcastle steel-making operations and the associated laying off of 2,500 workers.  </p>
<p>Newcastle's rod and bar mills would be retained and developed into the centre for BHP's rod, bar and wire business.</p>
<p>BHP's 3,000 Newcastle workers went on a 24 hour strike last Friday.</p>
<p>The BHP spokesman said a range of meetings between company representatives and unions were currently underway which involved a number of different issues.</p>
<p>&quot;We have put the strategy, which we believe is necessary to build this business, on the table and we would hope to be able to work with all the people involved in the transition arrangements,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The spokesman said BHP had provided about two years of notice that integrated steel making would end at Newcastle.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless we understand people's views and we hope to work with people,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>BHP shares closed one cent weaker at A$18.03 after reaching an intra-day high of A$18.22 before the strike was announced.</p>
