<headline>NZ SPORT - Walter Little on the comeback trail.</headline>
<text>
<p>HAMILTON, Aug 4 - Long-serving All Black second five-eighths Walter Little will continue his comeback bid at Hamilton's Rugby Park on Monday, NZPA reports.</p>
<p>But just how many of his first-choice provincial team-mates will join him in the North Harbour team to play Waikato in the 3pm match is uncertain.</p>
<p>Waikato coach John Boe has named a strong line-up for the NPC warm-up game, injuries in today's Waikato club finals permitting, with only All Black test reserve Scott McLeod unavailable.  </p>
<p>But Harbour coach Peter Thorburn is reluctant to field any players involved in the North Harbour Club championship final two days later, while others like Eric Rush, Steve Simpkin, Glen Davis and Willie Walker are injured.</p>
<p>&quot;We're struggling a bit. We actually requested the game be cancelled about six weeks ago, but Waikato negotiated to play it on Monday instead of Sunday and it is going ahead,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll be competitive, but we won't be as competitive as we will later in the season.&quot;  </p>
<p>Little, his brother Lawrence and halfback Mark Robinson are all likely to play in the North Harbour team to be named tomorrow as they are not involved in the club championship play-offs.</p>
<p>Thorburn said Walter Little was over a recent ankle injury.</p>
<p>The 44-test veteran was now back running freely at training and was no longer even strapping the injured knee that has kept him off the international scene this year.</p>
<p>Boe sees the game as vital for his team. Their only other warm-up game before they open the NPC against Otago on August 15 is against Wellington next weekend.  </p>
<p>&quot;These are the two most important games in the build-up. The other three games were all about experimentation, but these are about establishing combinations and a team pattern,&quot; Boe said.</p>
<p>Last year Waikato used only second division opposition to build up to the NPC and felt it in the first game against Otago, who had had the benefit of a game against Canterbury the previous week. That is why North Harbour and Wellington were included in the schedule this time.  </p>
<p>Waikato: Matthew Cooper, Aisea Tuilevu, Damian Karauna, Bruce Reihana, Aaron Collins, Ian Foster (c), Rhys Duggan, Deon Muir, Dean Anglesey, Mark Cooksley, Steve Gordon, Aaron Hopa, Graham Purvis, Greg Smith, Michael Collins. Res: backs, Todd Miller, Glen Jackson, Jason Spice; forwards, Blair Foote, Richard Coventry, David Briggs, Nick Mantell.</p>
