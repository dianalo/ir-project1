<p>One billion Ecus in European Union funds for the EU's Mediterranean neighbours could be frozen next week unless the European Commission agrees not to send money to Turkey, a Euro-MP said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to get an agreement on a code of conduct on what to do about MEDA funds to Turkey. Otherwise the Commission could find large sums of money put into the reserve,&quot; British Socialist Terry Wynn told Reuters.</p>
<p>Wynn said the European Parliament's budget committee would decide next Monday what action to recommend on the MEDA programme, which has one billion Ecus for projects which will help shore up the EU's southern flank.</p>
<p>Parliament is due to decide what action to take when it gives the EU's 1997 budget a second reading on December 12.</p>
<p>The committee would also have to decide on Monday its position on funding for trans-European transport networks (TENs), the EU's fourth research framework programme and the peace process in Northern Ireland, Wynn said.</p>
<p>Parliament President Klaus Haensch would write to Commission President Jacques Santer on Thursday asking him formally to commit the Commission to a code of conduct on funding for Turkey, the Euro-MP said.</p>
<p>Parliament drew up the code in September, in response to Turkey's perceived failure to honour promises it made in 1995 to carry out political reforms in return for parliament consenting to an EU-Turkey customs union.</p>
<p>The code of conduct commits the Commission not to allocate MEDA funds to Turkey except for projects designed to encourage democratisation and respect for human rights or support civil society.</p>
<p>Wynn agreed freezing the whole of the MEDA budget would badly affect other Mediterranean countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, but said a solution could be found.</p>
<p>&quot;We would say to the Commission: 'You make a transfer request to take 80 percent out of the reserve and show us where the money is going. If it's not going to Turkey, we will release it.'&quot;</p>
<p>The budget committee would probably say on Monday it supported EU ministers' suggestions for finding money to support the Northern Ireland peace process in 1997, Wynn said.</p>
<p>Budget ministers agreed on November 19 to earmark 100 million Ecus from the Structural Funds for the peace process but not to spend it until they were sure the money would not be needed for other purposes.</p>
<p>To allay parliament's fears, the budget Council agreed the money for thE so-called negative reserve would not be taken out of RECHAR II and RETEX -- two Structural Fund programmes to help declining coalmining and textile regions.</p>
<p>Finding a consensus between the political parties in parliament on funding for research and TENs would be more difficult, Wynn predicted.</p>
<p>He said the Christian Democrat European People's Party was likely to back the Council's decision to create a 100-million- Ecu negative reserve for research from the 1997 budget for internal policies (set at roughly five and a half billion Ecus).</p>
<p>The 182-member EPP would probably also agree with Council that the TENs should be funded from the 5.5-billion-Ecu budget for external policies.</p>
<p>Parliament's 258 Socialist and Liberal Euro-MPs disliked the proposals and wanted all the money to come from the internal policy budget, Wynn explained.</p>
<p>If the TENs were inserted in the external budget, only those projects creating transport links to the EU's neighbours to the east and south would be eligible for funding.</p>
<p>Projects within the EU would be put on hold, Wynn said.</p>
<p>But he was not optimistic the two groups could muster the 314 votes needed to push their line through Parliament on December 12.</p>
<p>An absolute majority of 314 votes is needed before parliament can amend the draft budget at second reading.</p>
<p>Both parliament and Council must agree on the figures before the budget can be implemented.</p>
