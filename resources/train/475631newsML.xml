<p>About 300 people staged a rare protest against Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and his government's economic policies on Sunday.</p>
<p>The protesters, mainly pensioners and communists, were angered by a backlog of unpaid wages and pensions and demanded restoration of the Soviet Union in the demonstration in the centre of the Central Asian state's capital, Almaty.</p>
<p>They carried banners declaring &quot;The president must be sacked&quot; and &quot;Nazarbayev, your reforms are a noose around our necks&quot;. Traditional Soviet songs rang out of a makeshift loud speaker and some people waved red Soviet flags.</p>
<p>&quot;Nazarbayev and his government have betrayed their people and sold 90 percent of our industries to capitalism. Down with the bourgeoisie,&quot; protester Utegen Kabaziyev, who called himself a devoted Bolshevik communist, told Reuters.</p>
<p>An elderly woman screamed: &quot;We had guaranteeed food, clothes and work in Soviet times but we have nothing today.&quot;</p>
<p>Many people are disenchanted with the government's privatisation proramme and some have not received their wages or pensions for several months.</p>
<p>Leonoid Solomin, chairman of Kazakhstan's free trade unions, said combined salary and pension arrears now totalled about 100 billion tenge ($1.3 billion dollars).</p>
<p>But Sunday's protest was isolated, unsanctioned by the authorities and not supported by the trade unions. Nazarbayev rules with a firm hand and tolerates little dissent in the former Soviet republic of almost 17 million people.</p>
