<p>A 90-minute artillery duel shattered a fragile ceasefire in the Congo Republic capital Brazzaville on Monday as the world tried to cobble together a multi-national force to restore peace to the city.</p>
<p>The shelling and gunfire, the worst breach since the truce took effect on June 17, threatened for a time to complicate efforts by local mediator and city mayor Bernard Kolelas to halt a return to all-out hostilities in the former French colony.</p>
<p>Relative calm later returned to the city.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a heavy artillery and small-arms fire duel between the two sides, with the parliament -- which was meant to meet today -- apparently a target,&quot; French ambassador Raymond Cesaire told Reuters by telephone during the barrage.</p>
<p>Despite the truce, no day has gone by without some firing, blamed by mediators on rogue elements in the two rival forces, supporters of President Pascal Lissouba or of his predecessor, former military leader Denis Sassou Nguesso.</p>
<p>The United Nations is trying to put together a mainly African intervention force for Brazzaville, but insists that the truce must first be rigidly observed. They also demand proof that both sides are committed to finding a political solution.</p>
<p>&quot;There is little new, there has been no progress politically,&quot; said Laurent Viguier, number two at the French embassy in Brazzaville, the only Western embassy still open.</p>
<p>The truce, negotiated last week as French troops left the city after evacuating foreign nationals, stopped political and ethnic clashes that began on June 5. Initially for 72 hours, it was extended to midnight on Thursday.</p>
<p>The clashes have killed hundreds of people, although medical workers have not yet been able to compile an official toll. The capital of the oil-producing Central African nation is carved up into rival strongholds.</p>
<p>During Monday's exchange at least two shells slammed into houses near a crowded market in the Bacongo suburb, until now a haven of peace controlled by Kolelas's neutral militia.</p>
<p>Six people were wounded, two of them critically, and rushed to hospital. Panicky civilians, fearing the war was spreading, loaded into at least five trucks that headed off into the countryside, which has not been touched by fighting.</p>
<p>Hundreds of refugees pile into canoes each day to escape across the river to Kinshasa, capital of the former Zaire.</p>
<p>Lissouba, Sassou Nguesso and Kolelas were the main contenders in presidential elections that had been due on July 27 but have been postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p>The clashes began after government troops surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home on June 5 as part of a crackdown on private militia and unauthorised firearms in the run-up to the election.</p>
<p>A June 16 attempt by Gabon's president Omar Bongo and other African leaders in his capital Libreville to rally the two sides around a peace deal collapsed.</p>
<p>Both Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso publicly support an intervention force. The U.N. says it will need 1,600-1,800 troops to secure the airport and divide the warring parties.</p>
<p>A similar force in Bangui, capital of neighbouring Central African Republic, clashed with disaffected soldiers at the weekend. The clashes killed at least 30 people.</p>
<p>France, which has a defence pact with the Bangui government, refused calls from Lissouba and U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun to leave troops in Brazzaville to act as a buffer force. Its forces pulled out last week after evacuating almost 6,000 French and other foreign nationals.</p>
<p>Kolelas's militia was at the heart of similar political and ethnic clashes in 1993 after a disputed parliamentary election. Those clashes killed at least 2,000 people.</p>
