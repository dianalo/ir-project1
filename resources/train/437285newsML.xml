<title>USA: Soybean prices lead grains lower, oil markets rise.</title>
<headline>Soybean prices lead grains lower, oil markets rise.</headline>

<p>Soybean prices fell sharply on Wednesday on concerns that U.S. prices had surged too high for the world market.</p>
<p>In other markets, energy prices rose strongly on forecasts for colder weather while grains and cotton prices fell. The Knight Ridder Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodity futures closed down 2.01 points at 245.13 points.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, May soybeans fell 27 cents a bushel to close at $8.28-1/2, sparked by news that a trading house had sold 45,000 metric tons of soybeans from Brazil -- a main U.S. rival for soybean exports -- for shipment to a customer in the United States who had sought lower prices.</p>
<p>The U.S. is dominant in soybean production, accounting for half of the annual 137 million ton production. But futures prices this week soared to 8-1/2 year highs on continuing heavy demand for soybeans to produce feed and industrial oils.</p>
<p>&quot;Brazil is on stream now, not just to Europe and the Pacific Rim but to us, too,&quot; said grain analyst Steve Bruce of E.D. and F. Man International.</p>
