<p>China has withdrawn armed ships from disputed islands in the South China Sea after protests by Manila that they were trespassing, defusing tension in an area claimed by six Asian nations, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;A Highlander plane reconnoitred the area this morning and there are no more Chinese naval vessels near Panata and Kota island. They are gone,&quot; Major-General Reynaldo Reyes, commander of the Western Command, told Reuters.</p>
<p>His command includes the Spratly islands, a cluster of reefs and islands scattered in the South China Sea. Beijing says the entire area, whose allure lies in its potentially vast reserves of oil and gas, historically belongs to China.</p>
<p>Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei as well as the Philippines have stamped their claim on all or some of the area.</p>
<p>Vietnam, itself recently at odds with China over ownership of some islands, earlier this week called for calm in this latest dispute.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary Renato de Villa earlier told reporters he had been waiting for confirmation that the ships had left.</p>
<p>He said Chinese ships had visited the area before but it was unusual for them to anchor so close to islands which Manila claims. Panata is one of the islands.</p>
<p>Manila lodged its protest with Beijing after spotting the armed Chinese ships, accompanied by fishing boats, near the islands a week ago.</p>
<p>Originally, three armed ships were reported in the area, but de Villa said there were actually four, including one with a helicopter landing area.</p>
<p>&quot;It (China's encroachment) is really surprising... In your relations there should be no surprises,&quot; Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters.</p>
<p>China's presence near two islands occupied by Philippine troops caused an uproar in Manila.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Blas Ople, urged the government to seek help from the United States to make China remove the ships.</p>
<p>&quot;China's refusal to leave the waters off the Kelayaan islands despite a Philippine government demand is a slap at our sovereignty and a gross flouting of international laws,&quot; Ople said before word was received that the ships had left.</p>
<p>After a similar incident two years ago, the two countries agreed not to do anything to disturb peace in the area.</p>
<p>Tension flared in 1995, when Manila accused the Chinese of building what it said looked like naval support structures on Mischief Reef. Beijing said they were shelters for fishermen and refused to dismantle them.</p>
<p>De Villa said he was still concerned about a new building constructed by the Chinese.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not know their intentions... but it concerns us that there is a hut-like structure that has sprouted in the shallowest part of a reef, very, very close to Panata Island,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not drawing any conclusion... we are just saying that we are concerend that they might have some intentions in the area,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Some foreign ministry sources said they were not alarmed by events which they felt were being played up for domestic consumption as the armed forces sought a bigger budget to replace its ageing military hardware.</p>
