<p>President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday dismissed as &quot;fantasy&quot; suggestions his wife run as a presidential candidate so he could still direct Philippine affairs behind the scenes when he steps down in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;You laughed as you were making the question, so did Mrs Ramos and so did I,&quot; Ramos told his weekly news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a fantasy.&quot;</p>
<p>A citizens group calling itself Presidential Movement for Ming Ramos has urged the drafting of Ramos's wife, Amelita, as a candidate in next year's presidential election.</p>
<p>Ramos, whose term ends in June 1998, is barred from running for re-election under a constitutional provision that limits a president to only one six-year term.</p>
<p>Manila newspapers on Wednesday quoted a leader of the group as saying if Mrs Ramos, popularly called &quot;Ming,&quot; is elected, her husband &quot;can still run the show.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know I am against dynasties in the political field,&quot; Ramos said laughing.</p>
