<p>They shoot darts, ooze goo, kill aliens, need diaper changes and shave their legs. They are the tens of thousands of new toys being offered this year at the American International Toy Fair.</p>
<p>To top it all off, there are 125 new Barbies.</p>
<p>Toy manufacturers are strutting their stuff at the annual toy trade show, being held this week in New York. They are hoping that retailers and media executives will think their doll, game, or hand-held thingamajig is new, exciting, and nothing like last year's model.</p>
<p>As in years past, the classic toys stand out among the huge mass of newer entries. Lego and Lincoln Log building sets, Frisbee flying discs, Play-Doh modelling compound, Hot Wheels toy cars, and Flexible Flyer sleds all remain perennial strong sellers. They're simple, they work and in the lingo of toy company execs, they suit children's &quot;play patterns.&quot;</p>
<p>But old standards don't breed the kind of excitement that translates into blockbuster hits, and the toy manufacturers want to get the market hopping after several years of disappointing sales growth.</p>
<p>Last year, U.S. retail toy sales increased to $20.7 billion, up only 3.6 percent, in one of the worst holiday shopping seasons in a decade.</p>
<p>Industry executives blamed a shortened selling season between Thanksgiving and Christmas, consumers who appeared to be carefully watching their shopping dollars, reports of unscrupulous labour practices in China and lists of dangerous toys.</p>
<p>Next year, sales should increase about the same amount, said David Miller, president of the Toy Manufacturers of America.</p>
<p>The one surprising bright spot came very late in the season, as Tyco Toys Inc.'s Tickle Me Elmo doll flew off store shelves. About one million Tickle Me Elmos were sold last year. So far in 1997, 600,000 units have been shipped out, Tyco U.S. President Michael Lyden said.</p>
<p>Last year, doll sales rose a strong 8.6 percent, with continuing recognition going to Mattel Inc.'s Barbie.</p>
<p>This year the world's largest toy maker is introducing 125 new Barbies, from a basic bathing suit model ($6) to the limited edition Billions of Dreams Barbie ($300). Many new Barbies have hair that changes colour when wet, such as Hula Hair Barbie ($16) and Bubbling Mermaid Barbie ($15).</p>
<p>Barbie in 1997 has become a dentist ($23), has a tie-in with restaurant chain Planet Hollywood ($23) and gets packaged with an Elvis look-alike doll ($60).</p>
<p>There are any number of dolls that wet their diapers, such as Kenner's Newborn Diaper Surprise ($22.99).</p>
<p>On one hand there are Hasbro Inc.'s Mr. Potato Head toys ($9.99 and up) and My Special Angel plush dolls ($19.99) -- simple and relatively no-frills.</p>
<p>On the other hand is Growing Up Pretty by Galoob Toys Inc., a doll that does for personal hygiene what Barbie does for shopping. The 18-inch doll puts on makeup, wears her first bra and -- a doll first -- shaves her legs ($22.99 to $24.99).</p>
<p>For all the talk in years past of toys that blur gender barriers, there are countless &quot;girls' toys,&quot; as there are any number of &quot;boys' toys.&quot;</p>
<p>For boys, the manufacturers are stressing alien- and enemy-fighting action figures, miniature hand-held and electronic racing cars, and dart-shooting air guns.</p>
<p>Action figures relating to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film trilogy abound from many manufacturers. Even Hasbro's G.I. Joe is going strong.</p>
<p>This year Joe comes in seven new varieties, including the U.S. Navy flight deck fuel handler and U.S. Marine Corp sniper, all in full battle dress. For the first time, Joe is a woman, U.S. Army heilcopter pilot, wearing flight jacket and regulation sun glasses ($24.99).</p>
<p>Just Toys has action figures based on World Wrestling Federation characters, including Marc Metro, Vader, and Psycho Sid. Sunny, the female fight promoter, is also new to the line ($2.99).</p>
<p>The Arizone Atomic Blaster ($11.99), a high-tech version of a pea shooter, and Airzone Airzooka ($14.99), both by Just Toys, can send foam missiles over 30 feet.</p>
<p>Boys are also the target audience for some of the goo and ooze that can be used to make dinosaur babies out of plastic eggs in Hasbro's Kenner Division line of toys tied to the upcoming Universal Pictures film, &quot;The Lost World: Jurasic Park&quot; ($5.99 to $49.99).</p>
<p>For children who fancy a world of adventure, Wild Planet has added to its urban exploration line with the Powerware Pak, a belt pack that offers battery power for the attachable am/fm radio and flashlight ($18 to $22).</p>
<p>Wild Planet is also introducing the Star Projector, a combination home planetarium and lantern ($18 to $22).</p>
