<p>Estonian Prime Minister Tiit Vaehi said on Tuesday that Russia should not oppose the expansion of NATO, saying the U.S.-led alliance helps guarantee security and stability in the Baltic region.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) will guarantee stability and Russia cannot be against stability in our region,&quot; Vaehi told reporters at a news conference at the end of a four-day visit to Singapore.</p>
<p>Russia strongly opposes the granting of NATO membership to the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>
<p>The three countries, annexed by Moscow in a deal with Nazi Germany in 1940, regained their independence only five years ago. Estonia is the smallest of the Baltic states, with a population of 1.46 million people.</p>
<p>Vaehi said Estonia would soon become a member of the European Union and be fully integrated in the trading alliance. &quot;I think we will fulfil all requirements of the EU,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Estonian leader also rejected criticism by Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who called for economic sanctions against countries discriminating against ethnic Russians, particularly singling out Estonia.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Russian speakers living in Latvia and Estonia do not have citizenship and claim they have been shut out of political life. In Lithuania, all members of the small ethnic Russian community were given citizenship.</p>
<p>&quot;In Estonia, we don't have problems between ethnic groups. Russia wants to see Estonia in its zone of influence and sometimes Russia wants to (engage) in propaganda,&quot; Vaehi said.</p>
<p>Primakov, a former spy chief, said on January 9 that Moscow should not hesitate in seeking to protect Russian speakers by resorting to economic sanctions. Up to 60 percent of Estonia's national revenue originated from trade with Russia, he said.</p>
<p>Vaehi wound up a four-day visit to Singapore after holding three hours of talks with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.</p>
<p>&quot;I had fruitful negotiations for three hours with the prime minister. Our relations are very good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The two countries were working on finalising details of an investment protection and double taxation agreement. An economic delegation from Singapore will visit Estonia this year in a bid to boost ties, Vaehi added.</p>
