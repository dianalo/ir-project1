<headline>EU to forecast Italy deficit-GDP of 3.1 pct - paper.</headline>

<p>The European Commission is set to forecast on Wednesday that Italy's ratio of deficit to gross domestic product, a key EMU target, will be 3.1 percent in 1997, La Repubblica newspaper said in an unsourced report.</p>
<p>The paper said the Commission had rewritten a review of EU economic and budgetary conditions, due to be published at 0900 GMT, after lobbying by Italian officials.</p>
<p>An EU source said last week that the report, which is often criticised for being politically motivated, would show Italy's deficit at 3.2 percent of GDP -- above the three percent target set by the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;The Italian offensive has borne fruit,&quot; La Repubblica said. &quot;We're no longer isolated in the rejects' ghetto with Greece. The forecast on our deficit in the end should be revised down from 3.2 to 3.1 percent of GDP.&quot;</p>
<p>The twice-yearly review had been expected to forecast that only Italy and Greece could be unable to meet the deficit goal.</p>
<p>La Repubblica said the wording of the entry on Italy had been changed to reflect the strenuous efforts of Italy's centre-left government to be in shape for EMU by its 1999 start.</p>
<p>&quot;The Italian authorities are strongly advised to realise in full the 1997 budget and additional measures adopted in March 1997 in order to reach the three percent GDP target adopted by the government,&quot; La Repubblica said the latest draft had said.</p>
<p>The previous draft said only that budget measures should be implemented &quot;to reduce the deficit compared with 1996&quot;, it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the document would also warn that Italy's deficit could rise again in 1998 when the effect of one-off measures has worn off. &quot;A supplementary reduction should be taken into consideration in the 1998 budget to...put public finances on a healthy basis in the medium-term&quot;.</p>
<p>It added: &quot;Temporary measures taken in 1997 should be replaced with structural measures which have a permanent effect on the budget.&quot; Italy's mini-budget last month was criticised for not tackling structural measures as had been promised.</p>
