<headline>Turkey expels Iranian consul.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-02-27</dateline>

<p>The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Thursday it was expelling Iran's consul to the eastern town of Erzurum, following his reported criticism of comments by a leading military official.</p>
<p>&quot;It was announced today...that the Islamic Republic of Iran's Erzurum chief consul Saeede Zare has been declared a 'persona non grata' and he must leave Turkey within 48 hours,&quot; a foreign ministry statement said.</p>
<p>The announcement added to a diplomatic row between Tehran and Ankara, which protested to Iran earlier this month about the Iranian ambassador's comments at an anti-Israel rally.</p>
<p>The statement did not give a reason for Zare's expulsion.</p>
<p>Turkey's state-run Anatolian news agency said Zare had accused the deputy chief of the Turkish armed forces, Cevik Bir, of &quot;irresponsibility&quot; for his comments about Iran during a trip to the United States.</p>
<p>Bir had described Iran as a &quot;terrorist&quot; state, according to Turkish newspapers.</p>
<p>&quot;Some pressure groups, sent General Bir to the U.S. and made him speak. With the same thought, those powers sent tanks onto the streets of Sincan,&quot; Anatolian quoted Zare as having said.</p>
<p>The Turkish Foreign Ministry protested to Tehran early in February after Iran's ambassador Mohammad Reza Bagheri spoke in favour of Islamic law at an anti-Israel rally in the Ankara district of Sincan.</p>
<p>Tanks toured Sincan several days after the protest in an apparent warning to Islamists from the secularist army.</p>
<p>Bagheri left Turkey last week, but a senior member of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist Welfare Party said his departure had nothing to do with the event.</p>
<p>Erbakan, Turkey's first Islamist prime minister, visited Iran soon after forming a coalition with conservatives eight months ago.</p>
