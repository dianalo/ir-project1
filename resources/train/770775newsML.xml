<p>French September bond futures ended slightly lower on Thursday, after having spent most of the day in positive territory, after being pressured by stronger-than-expected Chicago Purchasing Managers Index.</p>
<p>The CPMI pulled Treasuries and bunds down and these in turn affected the Notionnel, dealers said.</p>
<p>The index fell to 60.6 percent from 61.5 percent, indicating a slowdown, while prices paid rose to 61.6 percent from 53.7 percent which could indicate slumbering inflation.</p>
<p>Earlier bonds hardly reacted to a fall in U.S. jobless claims data and a 2.2 percent rise in the second quarter GDP.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton is due to meet his top economic adviser Janet Yellen to discuss the figures which showed a moderation in economic growth.</p>
<p>The September notional closed at 130.86, down from an opening of 130.98 and below a day high at 131.14.</p>
<p>Some traders said market makers had been trying to keep the contract close to 131 but the decline in Bunds and U.S. bonds just before the end of the session foiled the strategy.</p>
<p>One trader said the rise in the price component of the Chicago PMI was the catalyst for the decline and another said talk of a large seller of T-bond futures was also weighing on prices.</p>
<p>A trader at a French bank said one interesting feature of Thursday's session was strong buying of the French bond future and selling of the Bunds at the same time, by a U.S. house.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a get out trade. I remember them putting it on during the French elections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>During the elections there was strong buying of Bunds and selling of French bond futures, and one trader said if people were starting to unwind these positions it could help support French bonds in the coming days.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Chicago index in the afternoon made players feel edgy ahead of a series of data due on Friday.</p>
<p>They include payrolls, which are seen up 193,000, factory orders for June, expected to show a 1.5 percent rise, and the North American Purchasing Managers (NAPM) index, which is seen at 56.1.</p>
<p>French unemployment rose to a record 12.6 percent in the morning against expectations it would be unchanged at 12.5 percent. Economists said the figure was disappointing, especially taken together with poor consumer spending announced earlier this week.</p>
<p>The Bank of France kept its intervention rate unchanged at 3.10 percent at today's money market tender.</p>
