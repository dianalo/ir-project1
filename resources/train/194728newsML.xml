<p>The loss of a potentially massive military contract by McDonnell Douglas Corp will be felt heavily over the next decade, the company's president and chief executive said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of financial exposure, in the next five years, it's a pretty small program. But certainly in terms of the overall future, ten years and beyond, it is a significant program to us,&quot; Harry Stonecipher told reporters after the Pentagon announced it was eliminating McDonnell Douglas from a three-way competition to build 3,000 fighter jets.</p>
<p>He would not say how much money the company invested in its initial bid for the contract.</p>
<p>Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp will now compete to build the jets for the U.S. and Britain. The two companies will receive $661.8 million and $718.8 million, respectively, to develop prototypes from which a winner will be chosen in fiscal 2001.</p>
<p>Industry experts say the final deal could be worth more than $170 billion. Aerospace firms have said it could be worth several times that total if spare parts and other long-term items are included.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't turn out quite the way we expected it this morning, that's probably putting it mildly,&quot; Stonecipher said. &quot;This was clearly a surprise to us.&quot;</p>
<p>However, he said he will not challenge the Pentagon's decision. He expects to reassign the 200 employees who worked on the program to other areas.</p>
<p>There will be a complete debriefing next week during which the company will be told why the Pentagon eliminated McDonnell Douglas from the competition, he said.</p>
<p>Early indications suggest the Pentagon had doubts about the propulsion system used in the McDonnell Douglas design, Stonecipher said. &quot;The sense is that the propulsion system that we proposed was considered to be higher risk. We proposed a two-engine propulsion system with a vertical lift engine.&quot;</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas led a team that included Northrop Grumman Corp and British Aerospace Plc in its bid. Those companies are free to approach Boeing or Lockheed Martin for a stake in the next leg of the competition, if they choose, Stonecipher said. McDonnell Douglas has no plans to approach either firm, he said.</p>
<p>Analysts considered the contract crucial to McDonnell Douglas. Less than two weeks ago, the company announced its intention to reduce its commercial aviation efforts, when it scrapped plans to develop a long-range commercial jetliner.</p>
<p>The loss of the military contract will not change that decision, Stonecipher said.</p>
