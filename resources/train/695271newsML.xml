<p>United Steelworkers of America labor union said it may seek a meeting with Phelps Dodge Corp about the Chino copper mine in New Mexico where workers have been without a contract for exactly a year.</p>
<p>USWA lead negotiator Robert Guadiana said Phelps has provided the union with information about pay and benefits enjoyed by non-unionised workers at the company.</p>
<p>Phelps has said several times its offer of a pay freeze made last August is final. The union then requested additional information from Phelps.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the information that we have been requesting, and we are going through it. After we go through it we will be probably notifying them for another meeting,&quot; Guadiana said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to do that soon, but I don't have a date yet,&quot; Guadiana said.</p>
<p>The union also has seven complaints against Phelps filed with the National Labor Relations Board, but will not wait for the outcome of the complaints before asking the company for another meeting, Guadiana said.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to go forward,&quot; Guadiana added.</p>
<p>USWA is also in talks with BHP Copper to update a 15-year framework contract at the company's San Manuel and Pinto Valley operations in Arizona.</p>
<p>Both sides held in-depth meetings in Houston last week and were due to meet again July 12-13, Guadiana said.</p>
<p>&quot;They (talks) have made some progress and hopefully will be able to go a lot further and maybe get something out,&quot; Guadiana said.</p>
<p>BHP officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>It talks between BHP and USWA fail to reach agreement, arbitration will be invoked under terms agreed in the framework contract.</p>
