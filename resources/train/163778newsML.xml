<headline>Texaco execs planned to destroy evidence: tapes.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>Secret tapes of Texaco, Inc. executives show they discussed destroying key evidence in a discrimination lawsuit and disparaged minority workers as &quot;niggers&quot; and &quot;black jelly beans,&quot; a lawyer in the case alleged Monday.</p>
<p>Daniel Berger, who represents black employees suing Texaco, said he has filed a motion with a White Plains, N.Y., federal court asking that the company be sanctioned because of the officials' plans to destroy evidence. Excerpts from the tapes were included in court papers filed as part of the motion.</p>
<p>&quot;What we put in our papers is extremely damning because they discussed purging their files, shredding documents and concealing information,&quot; said Berger, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann.</p>
<p>He said lawyers at his firm were shocked when they received the tapes from a former Texaco executive who had secretly recorded the meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;Our jaws dropped. They are still on the floor,&quot; Berger told Reuters. &quot;I've been practicing law for 17 years and I've never come across anything like this.&quot;</p>
<p>The tapes were turned over as part of the legal proceedings in the suit that was filed in 1994 by six blacks who alleged that Texaco had been systematically discriminating against them in promotions and fostering a hostile environment since at least early 1991.</p>
<p>Some plaintiffs alleged that black employees at the company have been called &quot;orangutans&quot; and &quot;porch monkey.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Charles Brieant had asked the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to investigate the allegations and earlier this year the EEOC issued a finding that Texaco had failed to promote black employees because of their race.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs have asked the court to certify the suit as a class action to represent the some 1,400 minority employees at the company. A hearing on the certification issue is expected in December.</p>
<p>Texaco said it had heard about the tapes last week and had hired outside counsel, Michael Armstrong of Kirkpatrick and Lockhart, to conduct an independent investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;If these allegations are true, they represent an outrageous violation of the company's core values and principles. Any such conduct is deplorable and will never be tolerated by Texaco,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Berger would not comment on whether there were any settlement negotiations underway with the oil company.</p>
<p>The tapes were turned over by Richard Lundwall, who was the senior coordinator for personnel services in Texaco's finance department.</p>
<p>According to court papers, Lundwall was responsible for keeping minutes at some meetings of senior officials. He told lawyers that he had secretly taped the sessions to ensure the accuracy of his minutes.</p>
<p>Lundwall contacted the plaintiffs' lawyers after he left the company during the summer.</p>
<p>Excerpts of the tapes contained in court papers quote executives at a 1994 meeting in which they discussed the discrimination lawsuit and how they should destroy a key document.</p>
<p>In their conversations, some of the executives refer to African American employees as &quot;black jelly beans&quot; and &quot;niggers.&quot;</p>
<p>They are quoted complaining how the company has had to adjust to demands by minorities. They discuss how some black employees were interested in Kwanzaa, a December celebration based on African harvest festivals.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm still having trouble with Hanukkah,&quot; said one executive. &quot;Now we have Kwanzaa.&quot;</p>
<p>Texaco's stock lost $1.50 to trade at $98.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.</p>
