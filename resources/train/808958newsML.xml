<p>Wall Street stocks extended their rebound Tuesday morning, buoyed by healthy gains in technology stocks and confidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to boost interest rates, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>After last Friday's 247-point drop, followed by Monday's 108-point rally, the market seemed poised for further gains, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had some encouraging news in the technology field and almost no chance exists that the (Fed) will raise rates,&quot; said Dick Stein, vice president of U.S. Clearing Corp.  </p>
<p>The outcome of a meeting by the Federal Open Market Committee of central bank policy-makers is due to be announced about 1415 EDT/1815 GMT.</p>
<p>By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 61.78 points, or 0.79 percent, at 7865.14.</p>
<p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was even stronger, up 1.32 percent, or 20.68 points, to 1590.20.</p>
<p>Bay Networks Inc was most heavily traded on the Big Board, up 2-1/16 at 36-11/16, after the company said it expected revenues in the three months ending Sept. 26 to exceed analysts' forecasts.  </p>
<p>A string of other blue-chip tech issues also moved higher.</p>
<p>Stocks were also boosted by recovering bonds and futures. The long bond was up 4/32 to yield 6.51 percent, while S&amp;P 500 futures contract for September gained 5.05 points to 924.</p>
<p>&quot;The equity markets are going, to a great degree, to continue to follow the bond market,&quot; said Jim Pizzo, senior investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Analysts said there was also an absence of unpleasant surprises to rattle the market. Even the bitter 15-day strike at United Parcel Service was resolved overnight.</p>
