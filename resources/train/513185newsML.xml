<p>Airline start-up Australia World Airways (AW) said on Wednesday it expected to conclude a proposed A$25 million capital raising within two months and was in talks with overseas airlines about an equity injection.</p>
<p>AW founder Simon Warrender said that following approval on Wednesday from Australia's International Air Services Commission (IASC) for AW to fly the Australia-Sri Lanka-Greece-Netherlands route, it was in a good position to raise capital.</p>
<p>He said the IASC has given the airline six months to finalise its capital raising before it could start operations.  </p>
<p>&quot;We expect to conclude that in the next six to eight weeks,&quot; Warrender told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>AW became one of the few start-up local airlines in recent years to be given approval to fly. The country's recent aviation history has been dotted with airline start-up failures including the Compass I and II collapses in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Warrender said AW had been trying for four-and-a-half years to get an aviation licence. He said the lengthy wait was largely due to the IASC's stringent rules in the aftermath of the Compass failures and the last year's downfall of New Zealand discount airline, Kiwi International.  </p>
<p>Warrender, 74, an aviation consultant who worked with British aviation entrepreneur Freddie Laker in the 1970s, when Laker tried to break into the Australian market, said the airline had no plans to become a discount operator, but rather a 'value' airline.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to challenge the majors, we are basically a niche airline,&quot; said Warrender from his Melbourne office.</p>
<p>AW plans two weekly services on the Australia-Sri Lanka- Greece-Netherlands route using a Boeing 767-300 aircraft, but the approval was subject to AW securing the A$25 million funding, the ISAC said.  </p>
<p>The commission initially rejected Australia World's proposal in January, saying it was dissatisfied with the airline's financial arrangements.</p>
<p>Warrender said the group has exclusive rights to the Sri Lanka-Greece-Netherlands route. &quot;No one else can intrude on these routes from Australia, so we are in a good position to negotiate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added AW was talking to an American, a European and an Asian airline about injecting equity and forming an alliance.</p>
<p>AW plans to raise A$5 million in equity and was in talks with overseas banks on raising A$20 million in debt, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our long term plan is maybe in three, four or five years (to list on the Australian Stock Exchange),&quot; Warrender said.</p>
<p>Warrender said once the airline is up and flying the company plans to expand its services into other Asian countries, but there was no plans to start domestic operations.</p>
<p>He said AW also plans to provide freight services, with the intention of carrying perishable goods out of Australia and on to Europe and carrying general goods from Europe into Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be carrying quite a bit of freight. On the long hauls we can carry 10 tonnes,&quot; he said. AW plans its inaugural flight by the end of this year.  </p>
<p>Warrender said AW had chosen Melbourne as its base because it has the largest Greek population outside of the Greek capital Athens.</p>
<p>Direct passenger traffic between Greece and Australia in calendar 1996 was 57,800.</p>
