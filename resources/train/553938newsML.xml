<p>Water experts from Bangladesh, India and Nepal called on Thursday for countries dependent on Himalayan rivers for their water to work together more closely on regional development.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the current conducive atmosphere and positive political will in the countries, opportunities have emerged for negotiations,&quot; Q.K. Ahmed, chairman of the Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad, told the final session of a three-day meeting in Dhaka of water experts.</p>
<p>The meeting called for greater cooperation between countries of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) region, the area drained by those three rivers which converge in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The GBM region, which includes Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, Nepal and China is home to more than 500 million people.</p>
<p>Participants in the meeting stressed the need for sharing of data among GBM nations, especially in development and use of water resources.</p>
<p>The World Bank plans studies on future cooperation in developing the GBM region, meeting sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Asian Development Bank has identified the region as of &quot;great potential for cooperation in the field of energy, transboundary movements and communications&quot;, they added.</p>
<p>One meeting official told Reuters the meeting noted that the GBM concept had been boosted by recent treaties between India and Nepal on power purchases, trade and transit, and between New Delhi and Dhaka on sharing water from the Ganges river.</p>
<p>Meeting participants recommended concluding negotiations on various issues between nations of the South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement (SAPTA) and implementing subsequent agreements to deepen cooperation among South Asian countries.</p>
<p>SAPTA was set up in 1995 by Bhutan, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives, as the first step towards forming a free trade zone by 2005.</p>
<p>Those at the meeting called for introducing efficient and easy cross-border movements of people and goods by reducing border restrictions and tariffs.</p>
<p>A lack of cooperation could end up costing the area's countries more in the long run, the meeting was told.</p>
<p>Abul Hasan Chowdhury, Bangladesh Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, told the meeting: &quot;We must act now so that we can face the challenges of the future and convert the region into an area of prosperity.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, South Asia is one of the poorest areas on the globe, where more than two-thirds of the population live on less than $1 a day.</p>
<p>By 2025, the region's population is expected to double, exacerbating poverty, social tension and environmental degradation.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said: &quot;There are huge quantities of natural resources in the region. If we can harness all our water resources, up to 40,000 megawatts of power can be generated.&quot;</p>
