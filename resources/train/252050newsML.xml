<title>CHINA: China denies pressuring Disney over Dalai Lama film.</title>
<headline>China denies pressuring Disney over Dalai Lama film.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING</dateline>

<p>China denied Thursday that it put pressure on the Walt Disney Co. for backing a film about the life of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing accuses of fomenting unrest in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government ... has never put pressure in any way on the Disney Co,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.</p>
<p>He was responding to comment about a Western film industry letter criticising alleged attempts by Beijing to impose worldwide censorship on China-related films.</p>
<p>&quot;We only hope the Disney group will be able to better cooperate with China in relevant areas,&quot; Shen said. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The entertainment giant is eager to expand into Asia, particularly China, where demand for U.S. products is high. It remains to be seen if Disney's involvement in the film &quot;Kundun&quot; will hurt its ambitious business plans in China.</p>
<p>China said last month that Disney would be wrong to make a film singing the praises of the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Disney has said it would go ahead with the U.S. release of &quot;Kundun&quot; despite China's objections.</p>
<p>A group of 41 actors, actresses, producers and directors -- including Paul Newman, Oliver Stone, and Bernardo Bertolucci -- wrote to China's ambassador to the United States Wednesday protesting what they said was Beijing's &quot;attempt to impose worldwide censorship&quot; on films in or about China.</p>
<p>The letter said China's warning to Disney was the latest incident in a persistent effort by the Beijing government to censor the film industry.</p>
<p>They included a list of 12 occasions on which they believed the Chinese government had interfered with productions.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama fled his Himalayan homeland in 1959 after a failed uprising against communist rule and won the Nobel Peace Prize 30 years later for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for Tibet.</p>
