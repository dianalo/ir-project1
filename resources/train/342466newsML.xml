<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates end mixed, spots up.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end mixed, spots up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-01-29</dateline>

<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mixed but early-maturing contracts surged after the central bank banned state banks trading on the state debt secondary market, traders said.</p>
<p>Volume fell further to 2.64 million lots from 4.3 million also because of the ban. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of T-bills.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the shortest three-day contract rocketed to 36.5 percent from 12.85 percent on Tuesday. It hit a record high of 40 percent in intra-day trading. The rate for the most active 28-day contract rose to 9.8 percent from 9.4 percent.  </p>
<p>The People's Bank of China at a recent meeting in Beijing ordered commercial banks to phase out of trading on the state debt repurchase and spot secondary markets. They must not build new positions but offset existing positions.</p>
<p>Traders said the ban had effectively cut money supply on the repo market because the state banks used to be major supplier.</p>
<p>&quot;The ban has led to surges in early-maturing contracts and slow trading,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The trend will continue in the short term.&quot;</p>
<p>Another reason for today's rise in short-term contracts was the rise on the domestic A share markets in the past few days.  </p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai closed mostly up on a technical rebound, traders said.</p>
<p>But the most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006, the market barometer, fell to 115.30 yuan from 115.65 yuan, indicating market sentiment was still weak, they said.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market rose to 1.1 million lots from 675,400 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;The withdrawal of state banks from the spot market is gradually reducing liquidity on the spot market,&quot; said a trader.</p>
