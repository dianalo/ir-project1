<p>Spot electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) were said to have eased Wednesday with cloud and rains through much of the state and forecasts of normal to below-normal temperatures through next week, brokers and marketers said.</p>
<p>Next-day on-peak ERCOT power was talked in the $19.00-20.00 range for a 12-hour block, while eight to 10 hour blocks were priced more in the $20.00-21.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) range, the sources said.</p>
<p>On-peak electricity for a 16 hour block was talked at $20.00-21.00 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Off-peak next-day power was talked in the $12.00-13.00 per MWh range, from $13.00-15.00 on Tuesday, the sources said.</p>
<p>September on-peak electricity in ERCOT was pegged steady in the $20.25-20.50 range, while October physical power was assessed at $17.75-18.10 from $18.25-18.75 on Tuesday, the brokers and marketers said.</p>
