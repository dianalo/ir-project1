<headline>FOCUS - Euro markets mark time amid U.S. rate fears.</headline>

<p>Leading European shares were trading flat or weaker on Wednesday and currency trading marked time after renewed interest rate jitters in the United States put the brakes on Wall Street's recent surge.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed marginally down overnight, after falling nearly 40 points early in the session. The main London, Paris and Frankfurt indexes were marked by lacklustre trading in thin volumes, with London weakened by British inflation data.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange markets appeared moribund, with the dollar steady around levels seen late on Tuesday. Dealers said talk of a possible U.S. Federal Reserve rate rise was completely dominating transactions.</p>
<p>This follows comments on Tuesday by an unnamed Fed official to Reuters that eight of the 12 district banks in the Federal Reserve System have requested a rise in the 5.0 percent discount rate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets on September 24 and while the market has changed its mind several times about the likelihood of a rate rise, it now believes one is definitely in the offing.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was wary because of the wild swings in sentiment of late and investors were not willing to commit cash until they saw some hard figures. &quot;This really has stirred up a hornets nest,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy. &quot;The big ticket is the talk of a discount rate rise and it's that which is spooking people.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said that if the discount rate was raised it would suggest that the trend of U.S. rates had decisively turned, with serious implications for investors.</p>
<p>On the London stock market, analysts said the rate hiatus would mean investors would be wary of pushing ahead very far.</p>
<p>Meanwhile stronger-than-expected British retail sales early in the day pushed down government bonds, though analysts said the figures were not likely to have much impact on monetary policy. Stocks also slipped further from their opening, with the blue chip FTSE index 10 points down 1030 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading is quiet, People don't think the retail sales numbers are going to change very much and it was really just an excuse to mark the market lower,&quot; said one senior trader.</p>
<p>On the Paris bourse, stocks opened down and continued to trade in negative territory. Dealers said although the market was weaker on the U.S. rate worries, it was still well supported.</p>
<p>One bright point was Alcatel Alsthom, higher after announcing bid to buy Thomson SA and turn it into European defence leader.</p>
<p>A main focus was the French budget -- due to be released at 1400 GMT -- which Paris hopes will underpin its drive to European monetary union by proving it can meet Maastricht standards on  deficits.</p>
<p>Analysts said a warm market reception for the budget could pave the way for a French rate cut as early as Thursday.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares were trading flat and dealers said the market was consolidating after its recent run-up to record levels. Gains were capped by U.S. developments but shares were underpinned by a firmer German debt market and stable dollar, they added.</p>
<p>On the energy market, traders said oil prices were likely to stay firm for the rest of the year even if the military confrontation between Iraq and the United States was defused, thanks to bullish supply-demand fundamentals.</p>
<p>Lingering concerns over tight heating oil stocks approaching the winter and an indefinite delay to the UN's Iraqi oil-for- food arrangement should keep world benchmark North Sea Brent blend over $20 a barrel for the next few weeks, they said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1030 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.5135 marks and 110.18 yen compared with 1.5147 marks and 110.35 yen late in Europe on Tuesday .</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1030 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares had fallen 10.6 points to 3,961.7.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index dropped 3.12 to 2,077.74.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was up 0.92 at 2,629.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed easier at $382.90 against $383.55 at Tuesday's London close. Silver was at $5.05.</p>
