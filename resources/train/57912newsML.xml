<p>Southern African presidents may call a meeting with Angolan leaders to try and break the deadlock holding up the war-torn country's peace process, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mugabe told reporters after a three-hour meeting by five Southern African Development Community (SADC) leaders in Harare that the region was concerned at the slow progress in implementation of a peace deal the Angolan government and the former UNITA rebel movement signed in Lusaka, Zambia, in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to try and find a way to break the present impasse,&quot; Mugabe, chairman of a SADC unit set up to ensure peace in the region, said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a possibility of organising a meeting to be attended by both parties, government and UNITA. We are looking at that possibility,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The meeting -- which was held on the sidelines of the two-day World Solar Summit which ended in Harare on Tuesday -- was attended by Mugabe, Botswana's Ketumile Masire, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, as well as Angolan Prime Minister Franca van Dunem.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, van Dunem told the conference that although his country had ended its 20-year civil war, it was far from enjoying peace and stability.</p>
<p>&quot;In spite of the expectations, the peace process is yet to become a reality. We live in a state of no peace and no war,&quot; van Dunem said, accusing Jonas Savimbi's UNITA of lacking commitment to the Lusaka agreements.</p>
<p>The southern African country's situation has been precarious for the past two years, with the two sides trading accusations of holding up the United Nations-supervised peace process.</p>
<p>Last Friday, UNITA's secretary-general Paulo Gato said the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos was delaying talks to prepare a summit between him and Savimbi.</p>
