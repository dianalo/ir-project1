<title>NEW ZEALAND: New Zealand in position to cash in on millennium.</title>

<dateline>WELLINGTON 1997-07-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Zealand on Tuesday set up a Year 2000 board to help it cash in on millennium celebrations.</p>
<p>Because of its position on the dateline and its high latitude, New Zealand will be the first country to usher in the new century.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jim Bolger said he would chair a board &quot;responsible for establishing an over-arching national vision&quot; and which will develop a millennium brand promoting New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The dawn of the millennium literally gave New Zealand a golden opportunity to capture international focus,&quot; he said at a launch function.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealand is in an unrivalled position to attract tourism and world notice as the first nation in the world to welcome in the new millennium.&quot;</p>
<p>New Zealand hopes to tie millennium celebrations with the Olympics in Sydney in 2000 and the defence of yachting's America's Cup in Auckland. It appointed task forces reporting to the Year 2000 board on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Private companies hoping to make money from the new millennium are already scrapping about rights to prime spots in easternmost points of the country which will see the sun first.</p>
<p>Two years of scientific research by The Millennium Adventure Company concluded the first inhabited place to see light will be the eastern peak of Mount Hapeka on Pitt Island in the Chatham Islands group.</p>
<p>The sun will hit the island, which is 600 km (375 miles) east of New Zealand, at 3.59 a.m. (1459 GMT December 30).</p>
<p>Mount Hikurangi, near Gisborne on the east coast, will be the first place to see the sun on the mainland, 38 minutes after Mount Hapeka. The southern city of Dunedin will see it two minutes later.</p>
<p>The tiny South Pacific Republic of Kiribati, bisected by the international dateline, unilaterally declared a shift in the dateline in 1995, which meant the island group's easternmost Caroline Island, assumed pole position for first light in the millennium.</p>
<p>But the dateline shift has not been officially recognised.</p>
