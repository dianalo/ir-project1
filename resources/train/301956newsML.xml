<p>British Prime Minister John Major, leaving behind his electoral troubles for an enthusiastic reception in the Indian subcontinent, on Sunday left Bangladesh for Pakistan, his final stop on a week-long South Asian tour.</p>
<p>Major, who has used his tour to hammer home the message that open markets and growing trade help the poor far more effectively than aid handouts, captivated the Bangladeshi government and people.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit of Prime Minister (John) Major makes a milestone in our bilateral relations,&quot; Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told reporters at the Dhaka airport before seeing her guest off.</p>
<p>Bangladeshi men, women and children gave Major a huge, warm welcome when he visited a poor village 65 km (40 miles) north of Dhaka on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;It will never be the same again for us,&quot; said one official from nearby Manikganj town. &quot;We will long remember a smiling Major and his warm feelings for us,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The reaction was typical of Major's tour. The Indian media praised his charm, businessmen and women in Calcutta mobbed him at an evening reception and villagers in a poor rural area of Bangladesh lined the roads to cheer him as he visited aid projects.</p>
<p>The reaction is in stark contrast to the atmosphere at home, where a general election is now no more than four months away and the Conservatives have been unable to make any significant inroads into the opposition Labour party's 20 point poll lead.</p>
<p>Nervous ruling party members of parliament, faced with the prospect of losing their seats after 17 years of unbroken Conservative rule, have grumbled about Major's decision to go on a foreign tour just as the election battle heats up.</p>
<p>But Major, determined to avoid being rattled by Labour's lead, has defended his decision to go on his last scheduled foreign trip before the election, saying the business of government must go on.</p>
<p>Major's aides are not expecting any blockbuster trade deals to come from the tour of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>But officials have lined up a series of signings of joint venture contracts and new projects to underline Major's argument that Britain must stay involved in a region he sees as a potential economic powerhouse.</p>
<p>The British media have been less kind, interpreting several of his speeches as a bid for the ethnic Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani vote at home that could hold the balance in key marginal parliamentary seats at the general election.</p>
<p>But Major has shrugged off the reports, continuing with an exhausting schedule of official talks, receptions, commercial presentations and visits to aid projects.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, Major is scheduled to hold talks with caretaker prime minister Meraj Khalid, President Farooq Leghari and dismissed premier Benazhir Bhutto.</p>
<p>He will also fly to the Khyber Pass, the legendary gateway to the subcontinent defended by British regiments during the heyday of Britain's empire.</p>
