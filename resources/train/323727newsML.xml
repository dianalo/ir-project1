<p>U.S. blue chips finished lower on Wednesday, snapping their record-setting string at four sessions, as Wall Street showed clear disappointment with earnings at International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials fell 34 points to close unofficially at 6850. Virtually all of the loss was attributable to IBM, which skidded 10-3/8 to 157-5/8 a day after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that managed to beat estimates but still leave investors unsatisfied.  </p>
<p>Beyond the IBM plunge, the market's performance was decent, with broad indices such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and Nasdaq Composite rising to all-time highs.</p>
<p>But the spotlight was fixed squarely on Big Blue, whose results prompted a host of Wall Street analysts to trim earnings estimates, indicating earlier expectations for the company -- whose shares roughly doubled in price over the last year -- had run ahead of reality.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than easily achieve Street estimates, IBM appeared to be huffing and puffing,&quot; said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a note to clients.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, high techs and other large-cap stocks extended their rally, as earnings news remained broadly positive. According to data provided by I/B/E/S Inc, 56 percent of companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, with 27 percent falling short.</p>
<p>Still, several analysts voiced concern about the IBM sell-off, not only because of what it suggested about the outlook for corporate profits but because of what it said about the current psychology of the market.  </p>
<p>&quot;You almost get the sense that if a company reports in line (with estimates), the stock's going down,&quot; said Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going on three years of fairly continuous positive surprises and companies aren't going to be able to keep that up forever,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Another concern was that the increasingly strong dollar held back IBM's revenue growth in the quarter, an issue that extends well beyond the technology sphere to all multinational companies based in the United States.  </p>
<p>&quot;Is this an isolated occurrence? I don't think so,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer and Co. &quot;This foreshadows the real problem of 1997 because one of the pillars of this market has been earnings growth.&quot;</p>
<p>The strong dollar hurts U.S. companies doing business in other countries, Metz said, because it reduces the value of international sales and inhibits companies' ability to price products and services competitively in other markets.</p>
<p>For all the concern, investors stayed loyal to companies able to generate a pleasant surprise.  </p>
<p>Compaq Computer Corp was one, surging 5-1/8 to 83-3/8 after its fourth-quarter earnings of $1.64 per share handily beat First Call's consensus estimate of $1.53.</p>
<p>Computer Associates International Inc slid 2-1/2 to 43-1/2 after its earnings barely beat estimates. Analysts also expressed concern about broader weakness in the mainframe business, a key market for the company and for IBM.</p>
<p>Norand Corp surged 13-5/8 to 33 after the maker of mobile data collection and processing systems agreed to be bought by Western Atlas Inc for $33.50 per share in cash.  </p>
<p>Western Atlas, a provider of seismic surveys and wireline services, dipped two to 70-1/8.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 3.51 to 786.23, the NYSE Composite rose 1.23 to 412.80 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 11.09 to 1388.06, all record highs.</p>
