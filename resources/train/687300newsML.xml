<p>The Spanish economy is seen growing three percent in 1997 -- a rise once dismissed as wishful thinking on the government's part -- and the risk, if any, is that it surpasses that target, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Spain reported that gross domestic product (GDP) rose 2.9 percent year on year in the first quarter after a 2.6 percent rise in the last quarter of 1996. GDP rose 0.9 percent in the first quarter over the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;There is clearly quite a bit of momentum in the Spanish economy. Recently we thought three percent was overambitious, but it clearly is not overambitious,&quot; said Norman Williams, European economist at BZW in London.</p>
<p>According to a CSFB study which rated countries by growth prospects, Spain stands in the first league with Great Britain, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, while the second league groups France, Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>After strong April industrial production data, and a significant fall in May unemployment, economists now expect a further pick-up in Spanish growth.</p>
<p>&quot;A week ago we revised Spain's GDP forecast higher, putting it above three percent, at 3.1 percent,&quot; said Jose Luis Alzola, economist at Salomon Bothers in London.</p>
<p>&quot;And this (GDP) data confirms our expectations,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Other economists were even more optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The number is very good and probably the official growth forecast of three percent at year-end will have to be revised upward,&quot; said Javier Requena, director of analysis at Benito y Monjardin in Madrid.</p>
<p>He added that Spanish GDP could end 1997 at about 3.2 pct.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said GDP would exceed 3.0 percent in the second quarter after nearly reaching that level in the first three months of 1997.</p>
<p>Banco Central Hispano, (BCH) in a commentary on Wednesday's data, said it expects 1997 GDP to grow 3.3 percent as a yearly average, with a 4.0 percent increase at the end of 1997.</p>
<p>BCH added that Spanish internal demand should grow 3.2 percent in 1997 after 1.5 percent in 1996, replacing exports as a the motor fuelling growth.</p>
<p>Such a brilliant outlook for the economic growth has yet to awaken fears of inflation tensions, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I understand the Bank of Spain's caution in wanting to see how private consumption developed, while at the moment, I don't see a reheating of the economy in these numbers,&quot; said Valentin Fernandez, economist at Credit Lyonnais in Madrid.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Bank of Spain governor Luis Angel Rojo said no more big progress in inflation should be expected but he added that the central bank's forecast still aims at CPI staying below two percent this year.</p>
<p>He added that CPI rate should also remain around two percent in 1998.</p>
<p>According to the latest avaliable figure, May CPI showed a 1.5 percent year-on-year increase, versus 1.7 percent in April.</p>
<p>But a steady recovery could prevent the Bank of Spain from cutting its key money market rate, now at 5.25 percent, any further, some analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not see why the Bank of Spain should cut (its rate) before next year,&quot; said Salomon's Alzola.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is picking up, inflation could head higher, wage inflation is high, and we start to have the suspicion that a strong rise in growth could have inflated the stock market.&quot;</p>
