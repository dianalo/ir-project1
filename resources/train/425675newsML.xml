<p>The unemployment rate edged lower last month to 5.3 percent as the economy continued to gain momentum, creating more jobs than it has since last spring, the Labour Department said Friday.</p>
<p>In its first reading of the nation's economic health in February, the government reported that a whopping 339,000 non-farm jobs were created, the most since May, after payrolls rose by a revised 247,000 in January.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast an unemployment rate of 5.3 percent, down from 5.4 percent in January, and an increase of 230,000 in non-farm payrolls.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is continuing to give us good, healthy growth,&quot; said Anthony Chan, chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors Corp in Columbus, Ohio. &quot;Things are heating up.&quot;</p>
<p>Warm winter weather led to a spate of hiring in the construction industry, which added 109,000 new jobs in February, or nearly one-third of the overall advance.</p>
<p>&quot;The magnitude of February's increase can be attributed largely to mild weather across much of the country, following unusually severe weather in January,&quot; said Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the department's Bureau of Labour Statistics.</p>
<p>The department's survey of businesses also showed strong growth last month in the services industry, which added 80,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The household survey pegged the overall number of job holders at 128.43 million, down 150,000, while the number of unemployed workers stood at 7.2 million, off by 63,000.</p>
<p>The stronger-than-expected payrolls data added to anxiety in the financial markets about whether the Federal Reserve might decide to raise interest rates to keep the economy from overheating.</p>
<p>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan recently warned that the Fed might take pre-emptive action to keep inflation at bay as the economy nears the completion of its sixth year of uninterrupted growth.</p>
<p>Economists said the chances of an imminent Fed move to boost rates remained uncertain.</p>
<p>&quot;Another month of strong data could push them over the brink,&quot; said Oscar Gonzalez, economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. &quot;The risks (of the Fed intervening) are growing.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell immediately after the report was issued but then rebounded, adding nearly a full point. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.80 percent from 6.88 percent Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The kind of things kept on the policy radar screen did not seem to worsen,&quot; said Banc One's Chan. &quot;There are still wage pressures but they're accelerating at the same pace that we have observed over the past several months.&quot;</p>
<p>Average hourly wages, for example, climbed 3 cents last month to $12.09, after edging up a revised 2 cents in January, the department said. Average hours rebounded from their sharp weather-related drop in January.</p>
<p>Government payrolls rose strongly, while the retail sector also saw marked growth in jobs created last month. Finance and real estate employment continued to post steady growth.</p>
<p>However, the manufacturing sector lost 2,000 jobs in February after creating 16,000 jobs in January, the department said. Factory overtime hours were up at 4.7 hours per week, while the factory work week rose to 41.9 hours.</p>
<p>The report also showed that the percentage of unemployed Americans who have left their jobs voluntarily fell to 10.9 percent in February.</p>
<p>Job leavers as a percentage of the unemployed, dubbed the &quot;quit rate,&quot; had climbed to 12.3 percent in January from 11.7 percent in December -- a fact noted by Greenspan as worrisome for the inflation outlook in his recent testimony to Congress.</p>
<p>The Fed chief warned that January's jump in voluntary job leavers may have signalled an end to an unusual period of worker insecurity that had helped keep a lid on wage demands.</p>
<p>Financial markets were watching the figure closely amid concerns that signs of growing wage pressures may prompt the Fed to raise rates to nip inflation in the bud.</p>
