<title>UK: LIFFE cocoa widens losses on NY, spec selling.</title>
<headline>LIFFE cocoa widens losses on NY, spec selling.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cocoa futures widened their losses to end Thursday at session lows, pressured by New York's slide on speculative liquidation.</p>
<p>Traders said London's prices were also pushed lower by trade and speculative selling.</p>
<p>Benchmark September gapped seven stg lower as expected and was driven to a low of 1,020 stg in the afternoon when some buying support emerged. It still closed 26 stg down at 1,021.</p>
<p>Other months also posted double-digit losses.</p>
<p>September earlier battled with 1,030 support but this gave way after New York tumbled in early trading, battered by a speculative sell-off.</p>
<p>New York's September went on to hit a low of $1,536 a tonne before standing $35 down at $1,541 at 1644 GMT. The spec liquidation had been anticipated as speculators were believed to be net long more than 20,000 lots.</p>
<p>Despite the latest setback, London remained trapped in its nearby 1,020-1,060 stg band at the moment following the big sell-off on July 3 which saw values falling by over 100 stg in one day.</p>
<p>A breach of 1,020 support could see the market testing the important 1,000 stg level again.</p>
<p>In switches, Sept/Dec widened to 29-30 stg from 23-25 on Wednesday while Dec/March stood at 20 stg.</p>
<p>The U.S. second quarter grind data, due to be released at 1245 GMT Friday, were expected to show an increase of between four and nine percent, one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I doubt it will have a real impact on the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the U.S., most analysts said they expect the grind to rise by five to 10 percent, although forecasts ranged widely from a five percent fall to a 15 percent increase.</p>
<p>&quot;Factories have been increasing their capacity and business has been good,&quot; said one. &quot;I would expect the grind to be up to 10 percent higher.</p>
