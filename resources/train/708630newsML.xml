<p>The death toll from a series of huge explosions at a munitions factory in central Turkey rose to two when a worker at the plant died in hospital, Anatolian news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>Thousands of residents of the town of Kirikkale spent the night outdoors in fear that blasts from the nearby factory would engulf their homes, the agency said.</p>
<p>Blasts that sent flames 1,000 feet (300 metres) into the sky shook the town all day on Thursday, damaging houses and destroying the factory.</p>
<p>The south of the town was evacuated after the first explosion. Kirikkale is home to around 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Dozens of people, including police and soldiers, were cut by flying debris and were treated in makeshift field clinics. The town's hospital was evacuated.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry estimated the damage to be at least one trillion Turkish lira ($6.7 million).</p>
<p>($1=149,400 Turkish lira)</p>
