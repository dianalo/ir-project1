<p>**  (1230 GMT) - Indian bourses close with small losses</p>
<p>**  Bombay's benchmark index closes 3.62 pts lower at</p>
<p>	  3,940.99, off 4,029.56--intra-day high</p>
<p>**  Fresh foreign fund buying fails to materialise as</p>
<p>	  traders see sharp volatility affecting buy orders</p>
<p>**  National Stock Exchange 50-stock index gains 15.60</p>
<p>	  points, or 1.39 pct, to 1,132.90 at start of new account</p>
<p>**  Delhi index falls 9.65 pts to 827.40, Calcutta 4.70 pts</p>
<p>	  to 474.65 and Madras 26.67 pts to 3,690.26</p>
<p>Major Indian bourses closed slightly lower on Wednesday as buying by foreign funds failed to materialise in a day of volatile trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is going to be some profit-taking at these levels, around 4,000. This is really healthy for the market,&quot; said Basant Agarwal, head of equities at JM Share &amp; Stock Brokers.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction gives a chance for general investors to enter the market,&quot; Agarwal said. Stocks at the National Stock Exchange however, ended higher on fresh position building by operators at the start of the weekly account.  </p>
<p>At the Bombay bourse, many pivotals including ACC, BHEL, Sterlite and Hindalco hit their 25 percent ceiling on price increases in a week, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is consolidating gains,&quot; said Dinesh Khemlani, dealer at Bombay brokerage Khandwala Finance Ltd. &quot;Most shares are at their peak and there's no scope for further rise.&quot;</p>
<p>The sharp price fluctuations in blue chip stocks kept foreign funds on the sidelines, thus offsetting market hopes of fund demand fuelling a rally, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;They (foreign funds) are very selective buyers and have not jumped in the market,&quot; JM's Agarwal said.  </p>
<p>In the 1997/98 (April-March) budget presented to Parliament last week, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram slashed corporate and personal taxes, raised foreign portfolio limit in Indian firms and lowered import duties on a wide range of goods.</p>
<p>The new reforms asserted India's commitment to continued economic liberalisation begun in 1991 and helped improve confidence among foreign investors, analysts said.</p>
<p>In morning trade, the benchmark BSE 30-share index on Wednesday crossed an eight month high of 4,007.91 reached last week at 4,029.56, but lost way and ended at 3,939.0.</p>
