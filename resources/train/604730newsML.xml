<p>Britain's 164 Conservative members of parliament will vote in a first ballot for a new party leader to replace John Major on June 10, MPs emerging from a meeting of the parliamentary party said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said Sir Archie Hamilton, chairman of the party's powerful 1922 Committee, told them he had rejected allowing rank-and-file members of the party to vote in the election because there was not time to organise the arrangements that would be needed.  </p>
<p>However, the MPs said Hamilton had promised the committee would work out a plan for &quot;root and branch reform&quot; of the methods of choosing a leader which would be put to the annual Conservative Party conference in October.</p>
<p>Hamilton's proposals were agreed without a debate at a meeting which lasted only 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Six former cabinet ministers have already declared that they will be candidates for the leadership, which Major decided to relinquish after the party's disastrous showing in the May 1 election. They are William Hague, John Redwood, Kenneth Clarke, Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and Stephen Dorrell.</p>
<p>None of them is likely to win on the first ballot as the rules require them to get the support of half the parliamentary party plus 15 percent of those voting. Further ballots will probably therefore be necessary in which the hurdle for victory is gradually lowered.</p>
