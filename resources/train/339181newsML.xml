<p>Australia's 200 automotive component manufacturers said on Tuesday the automotive industry's future was in doubt if the Industry Commission's draft recommendations for its future were implemented.</p>
<p>Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers (FAPM) director Malcolm Stewart said the recommendations lacked any sense of commercial reality and if implemented, would result in a loss of future investment in the industry.</p>
<p>The government's Industry Commission said in a report released on December 20 that tariff assistance for the automotive industry should be reduced to five percent by 2004.  </p>
<p>It recommended that tariffs be cut by 2.5 percentage points each year until 2004 when it would reach the general manufacturing rate of five percent.</p>
<p>The current tariff on car imports is 25 percent, in addition to wholesale sales tax.</p>
<p>However, one of the three commissioners, Ian Webber, had instead recommended that a further review was necessary around 2000 when the industry's viability should be considered as well as other APEC countries' progress in reducing tariffs.  </p>
<p>&quot;The two key failings of the majority recommendations are an excessively narrow focus on tariff reductions after the year 2000, together with the failure to recommend any arrangements encouraging further development of automotive exports,&quot; Stewart said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said the FAPM would call on the government to keep in place a package of measures which would both encourage the maintenance of investment and continue the development of the export market.  </p>
<p>&quot;The continued presence in Australia of a strong and competitive automotive parts and assembly industry will continue to provide significant rewards to Australia, our people and economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Stewart said component exports exceeded the A$1 billion mark in 1996 and predicted that they could go as high as A$2 billion by 2000.</p>
<p>The FAPM said Australia's parts industry makes up well over half the automotive sector and employs 24,000 people in 300 plants with an annual turnover of more than A$6 billion.</p>
