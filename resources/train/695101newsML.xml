<p>Forecasts of fresh rain sparked fears on Sunday of more flooding and mudslides in northern Italy and civil protection officials warned people to avoid travelling.</p>
<p>At least two people have been killed by the flooding or road accidents caused by landslides in the last three days in Lombardy and other northern regions, a civil protection department spokesman in Rome said.</p>
<p>Elegant stores in Como, the centre of the silk industry north of Milan, were flooded as Lake Como broke its banks. A number of the small towns on the western branch of the lake were hit by flooding or landslides.</p>
<p>After three days of driving rain, officials predicted more bad weather for Sunday afternoon following a respite of several hours.</p>
<p>Several valley areas north and east of Milan were isolated for much of Saturday as big mudslides cut off roads. Flooding in the Valtellina valley, which was cut off on Saturday, killed 64 people in 1994.</p>
<p>Thousands of people in low-lying valley towns and mountain hamlets subject to landslides have been evacuated to higher ground as a precaution.</p>
<p>Fears of serious flooding of the Adige River in the Trentinto and South Tyrol regions near the Austrian border abated as a pause in rain allowed the level of the river to fall.</p>
<p>At least seven people have drowned in the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas over the last three days as high winds whipped up waves.</p>
