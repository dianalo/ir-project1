<headline>ICCO meeting to end, reserve fund talk to continue.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The International Cocoa Organization's (ICCO) three-day meeting here is expected to end on Friday with a decision to defer talks on its planned special reserve fund until the September meeting.</p>
<p>The three-million-stg fund would bear interest and help mitigate ICCO's expenses if the agency ever closed.</p>
<p>In March, producers and consumers outlined a proposal to set up the special reserve fund, and ICCO members said on Friday they would stick with that proposal for now.</p>
<p>In that proposal, half of the money would come from buffer stock revenues while the remainder was equally divided between producers and consumers.</p>
<p>The first 1.5 million stg from buffer stock revenues was deposited into an interest-bearing account in April.</p>
<p>Details of how member countries' share of the money would be determined was yet to be decided, but some favoured basing it on the distribution of votes.</p>
<p>But Brazil has withheld its support for the fund, saying that money for the fund should not come from buffer stock revenues. Brazil holds the largest entitlement in the buffer stock revenues.</p>
<p>ICCO members had hoped to strike a compromise to appease all members, including Brazil, this week. But sources said discussions have remained deadlocked, and a decision would be deferred until the next meeting in September when a final proposal will be presented to and voted on by the council.</p>
