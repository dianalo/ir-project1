<p>A German intelligence chief on Wednesday defended Bonn's conduct in supporting a private agent who was detained in Colombia on suspicion of paying a ransom to get a German kidnap victim freed.</p>
<p>The case has caused outrage in Colombia, which has made ransom payments illegal in an attempt to stop money going to rebels. Colombia has accused the agent, Werner Mauss, of being a member of the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group.</p>
<p>Bernd Schmidbauer, Bonn's troubleshooter and coordinator of intelligence services, told questioners in parliament that unorthodox methods were needed to rescue German citizens where the foreign government could not help.</p>
<p>&quot;I would always resort to such methods if lives have to be saved,&quot; he said. &quot;You can be sure that if we could have asked the Colombian government to go and fetch the hostage, we would have done it.&quot;</p>
<p>Schmidbauer said the husband of kidnap victim Brigitte Schoene asked Mauss to help and Bonn had assisted by equipping him with false passports and a letter of support from the German embassy.</p>
<p>But he said he did not know if a ransom had been paid.</p>
<p>Mauss, a shadowy figure with long-standing experience of similar kidnapping cases in Colombia and good contacts with the rebels, was arrested in mid-November as he tried to fly out of the South American country on a chartered aircraft with Schoene.</p>
<p>German opposition parties have not called into question the need to resort to unorthodox methods to ensure the safety of a German citizen abroad.</p>
<p>But they argue Schmidbauer overstepped his brief by offering his services, in exploratory meetings with Colombian officials from May onwards, to try to restart peace talks between the Bogota government and the rebels.</p>
<p>Mauss was present at the meetings in Bonn, which began months before Schoene was kidnapped in August. Schmidbauer planned to use Mauss's contacts with the rebels to try to get them to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>&quot;The peace efforts had the blessing of the Colombian government while the rescue mission obviously did not,&quot; said opposition Social Democrat security expert Norbert Gansel after hearing Schmidbauer testify to parliament's foreign affairs committee.</p>
<p>Mauss has worked for German police and intelligence on a number of secret missons and also for German firms, especially in Colombia.</p>
