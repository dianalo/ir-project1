<p>South Korea's electronics exports were expected to grow by 9.3 percent to $45.05 billion in calendar 1997, the Electronics Industries Association of Korea said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Electronics exports are expected to grow 21.6 percent year-on-year to $23.95 billion in the second half of the year, but a sluggish performance in the first half would affect the annual performance, an association statement said.</p>
<p>It saw exports during the first half declining by 2.0 percent year-on-year to $21.1 billion.  </p>
<p>The association forecast domestic sales of electronics goods would grow by 8.6 percent to 11.48 trillion won in 1997 -- 5.78 trillion in the first half, up 7.7 percent, and 5.71 trillion in the second half, up 9.5 percent.</p>
<p>Electronics imports are projected to rise by a strong 12.6 percent to $31.05 billion, it said. Imports were seen growing by 10.8 percent to $14.6 billion in the first half and by 14.3 percent to $16.44 billion in the second half.</p>
<p>The association said computer hard disk drives, compact disc read-only memory drives, liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels and mobile phone handsets would continue to enjoy brisk exports.</p>
