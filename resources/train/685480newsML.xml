<p>Mining giant Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd said on Wednesday Lonrho PLC had suggested a deal in which Anglo would gain the British company's stake in one of Africa's most succesful gold mining companies -- Ashanti Goldfields Company Ltd.</p>
<p>Anglo chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson told analysts during a briefing on the company's annual report that Lonrho had mooted the idea of swapping its 33.6 percent stake in Ghana's Ashanti for Anglo American's disputed Lonrho stake.</p>
<p>Anglo said in April it would cut its 27 percent stake in Lonrho to less than 10 percent after pressure from the European Commission.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that Anglo desperately wants a stake in Ashanti -- among the most profitable gold mining companies in Africa with interests spread across the continent.</p>
<p>Lonrho and South Africa's JCI Ltd -- the first black-controlled mining house -- said last month they were holding preliminary negotiations which could see the creation of a mining powerhouse with a market capitalisation of over $3 billion.</p>
<p>Press reports at the time said both companies were looking for a merger deal under which Lonrho's stake in Ashanti would go to Anglo American.</p>
<p>In return, Anglo's stake in Lonrho would be bought back and cancelled by the British mining-to-hotels conglomerate.</p>
<p>Ogilvie Thompson said the proposed swap -- which will reduce Anglo's stake to EC expectations -- was initiated by Lonrho.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of possibly swapping our Lonrho shares for shares in Ashanti is an idea that came from the Lonrho side, not from us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ogilvie Thompson said he also wanted to clear up a misconception that Anglo had initiated the possible merger between JCI and Lonrho.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of merging JCI with Lonrho came from JCI, not from ourselves... We are not, so to speak, running this thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Anglo has suffered a series of setbacks this year.</p>
<p>In addition to having to back down and agree to cut its Lonrho stake because the European Union saw two companies' combined platinum interests as constituting a monopoly of the world's platinum industry, Anglo also lost out on two more lucrative deals.</p>
<p>In the new Democratic Republic of the Congo, the company lost out on a bid to develop a major copper and cobalt project at Kolwezi, which President Laurent Kabila's government awarded to America Mineral Fields.</p>
<p>And in Brazil, an Anglo American-led consortium lost a bid last month for Brazil's mining giant CVRD.</p>
<p>CVRD was purchased by an international consortium led by Brazilian steelmaker CSN which bid $3.15 billion for 41.73 percent of voting CVRD share capital -- 20 percent above the minimum share price of $25.</p>
<p>Ogilvie Thompson said on Wednesday the company was obviously disappointed at losing the bid, but added Anglo was not prepared to overpay.</p>
<p>&quot;There is only one thing worse than disappointment and that is paying too much,&quot; he said.</p>
