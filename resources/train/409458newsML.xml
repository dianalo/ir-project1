<p>A computer breakdown abruptly halted trading on the Philippine Stock Exchange on Thursday, stopping profit-takers from cashing in on high-flying thirdliners, brokers said.</p>
<p>The bourse suspended trading after 18 minutes of modest turnover with some orders failing to appear on the exchange's main computer network, PSE chief operating officer Rafael Llave told reporters.</p>
<p>Speculative oil and mining stocks, which have been soaring in the past few days, showed signs of succumbing to profit-taking, Audi Pantillano, an analyst at Angping Securities, said.</p>
<p>Among the biggest losers were Atok Big Wedge, which fell 80 centavos, or 15.09 percent, to 4.5; Ebecom Holdings, which shed 8.0 centavos, or 8.60 percent, to 85; and Araneta Holdings, which dropped six centavos, or 4.1 percent, to 1.40.</p>
<p>These issues had been rising on persistent rumours of upcoming real estate deals.</p>
<p>Raul Ruiz, vice president of Sun Hung Kai Securities, said the early selldown in speculative issues would not snowball since the counters would be easily picked up by bargain hunters.</p>
<p>The composite index shed 14.40 points, or 0.43 percent, to settle at 3,335.42 points before the bourse decided to suspend trading, making it the closing level for Thursday.</p>
<p>The Philippine stock exchange has suffered several computer breakdowns in the past. But brokers remained optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors will still be buying depending on the market fundamentals and not on the efficiency of the computer system,&quot; Sun Hung Kai's Ruiz said.</p>
