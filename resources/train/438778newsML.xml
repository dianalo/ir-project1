<p>One of Latvia's largest companies, Latvian Shipping needs to invest in tanker and refrigerator fleets to keep their market share, the firm's acting president was quoted as saying in a newspaper on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We would not only invest in new ships but would also lease them and enter joint ventures with other ship operators,&quot; Andris Klavinsh, was quoted by Dienas Bizness as saying.</p>
<p>Latvian Shipping, currently due for privatisation, is among the largest refrigerator fleet operators in the world with 24 ships and one of the biggest tanker fleet's in Europe.</p>
<p>The company's audited 1996 results are due on June 20, the newspaper quoted the company's management as saying.</p>
<p>Latvian Shipping, which says it is the world's 19th largest shipping firm, has reported a $25 million loss in 1996 and a $51 million loss the year before.</p>
<p>The chairman of the company, Druvis Skulte, was reported by the newspaper as saying that it could cut its losses more in 1997 than by the previously planned $19 million.</p>
<p>The board plans to adjust the company's budget on a quarterly basis.</p>
