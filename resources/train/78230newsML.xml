<p>Security chief Alexander Lebed, who marks his first 100 days in President Boris Yeltsin's team on Thursday, has won public praises for ending war in Chechnya but his ambitious drive for power scares many in Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;There is new roving striker in Russia's game of political football whose only aim is hitting the goal,&quot; popular tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets said. &quot;You cannot move him from the field unless you break his leg.&quot;</p>
<p>Retired general Lebed came third in the first round of Russia's presidential poll this summer and later joined Yeltsin to help him defeat a strong communist rival in the run-up vote. But he made clear his alliance with Yeltsin was conditional.</p>
<p>&quot;I've come to serve the state, not you. That's what I told Yeltsin,&quot; Lebed told Nezavisimaya Gazeta in an interview.</p>
<p>It took him less than two weeks in office to announce an end to the 21-month Chechnya war, which had caused tens of thousands of casualties and inflicted humiliating defeats on Russian troops.</p>
<p>But Lebed admitted to Nezavisimaya that public approval of his peace deal with separatist leaders was far from unanimous.</p>
<p>Some top politicians have said the deal, which legalised the separatist leadership, agreed terms for a troop withdrawal and postponed for five years the key issue of whether Chechnya may become independent, could divide Russia.</p>
<p>Many people, including the military, viewed it as a further humilitation to the Russian nation.</p>
<p>Both the Chechnya deal and Lebed's open distaste for professional politicians appeal to many Russians.</p>
<p>But Lebed, who makes no secret of his presidential ambitions, has made little progress on other key election promises, notably fighting crime and corruption.</p>
<p>He complains that President Boris Yeltsin's illness has isolated him in the Kremlin and prevented him from carrying out many of his plans.</p>
<p>&quot;An alliance has been formed, but unfortunately the president has health problems,&quot; he told Izvestia daily.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Yeltsin) communicates with a limited circle of people of which I am not a part,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has been in Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital since September 13 and is due to have heart bypass surgery within eight weeks.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin's absence has neverthless made Lebed one of a top-level triumverate with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais.</p>
<p>Lebed's press office said in a statement that Izvestia had not agreed the final text of interview with him. But deputy editor Nikolai Bondaruk told Reuters all quotes were genuine.</p>
<p>Lebed also made clear in the interviews that he did not agree with those using liberal Western recipies to change Russia's political landscape.</p>
<p>&quot;They are all yesterday's men,&quot; he told Nezavisimaya when asked what he thought of Russian liberals.</p>
<p>The gruff general also sounded a conciliatory note towards the communists, Yeltsin's main political foes.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many decent, professional and hard-working people among the communists,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not reject such people, I work with them.&quot;</p>
