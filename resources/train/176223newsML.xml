<text>
<p>Hong Kong stocks capped a record-breaking week with a modest gain on Friday, finishing higher as investors took heart from the market's firm tone despite some profit-taking this session.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index closed 15.90 points higher at 12,751.16 after falling to a low of 12,667.71 during the session. Turnover was HK$8.42 billion compared to Thursday's HK$10.86 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are having a hard time understanding the truth that the market needs a period of consolidation,&quot; said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Analysts said selling pressure had been light on Friday despite the Hang Seng's recent record highs. The blue chip index registered an all-time intra-day high on Thursday at 12,898.30 points and gained 221.89 points, or 1.77 percent, this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The flows are still quite good coming in from overseas. I don't think we have reached the top yet,&quot; said Rory McAllister at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>But he said the market probably needed a breather.</p>
<p>&quot;At this level there is resistance,&quot; added Antony Mak, sales director at Vickers Ballas.</p>
<p>Rossiter said investors had been focused on Friday's &quot;runaway&quot; initial public offerings.</p>
<p>China Resources Beijing Land Ltd, the spinoff property arm of China Resources Enterprise Ltd, and Arts Optical International Holdings Ltd, an eye glass frame maker, made their market debuts on Friday.</p>
<p>Beijing Land closed the session at HK$4.05 compared to an issue price of HK$2.36 and Arts Optical finished at HK$2.25, up from an IPO price of HK$1.00.</p>
<p>&quot;It's completely defying logic and gravity,&quot; said Rossiter. &quot;People are trying to generate their own excitement even if it is high risk,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Utilities slumped on Friday with investors unimpressed with recent earnings announcements from China Light and Power and HongKong Telecom and with the sector's earnings prospects.</p>
<p>HongKong Telecom fell HK$0.15 to HK$12.90 and HongKong Electric shed HK$0.30 to HK$24.55. HongKong and China Gas slipped HK$0.15 to HK$14.25 but China Light advanced HK$0.10 to HK$34.40.</p>
<p>New World Development fell HK$0.70 to HK$46.10 following its slightly lower-than-expected 1995/96 earnings report.</p>
<p>Some second liner stocks took a beating. Prime Success fell HK$0.635 to HK$1.44 and Egana International slumped HK$0.27 to HK$1.26.</p>
