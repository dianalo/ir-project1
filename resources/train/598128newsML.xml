<p>Emerging market debt prices surged Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced it would not change U.S. interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>The Fed decision broke open a nervous day, when many market players seemed to expect a 25 basis point hike in U.S. interest rates. The absence of a policy shift led Brady bond trade into a frenzy of relief buying.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing a relief rally,&quot; said Kurt Schmid, managing director at SBC Warburg. &quot;Some money might be redeployed that had been on the sideline.&quot;  </p>
<p>Brazilian &quot;C&quot; bonds  BR8D14=RR led the charge, storming 1-1/4 higher to 77-1/4 bid in late afternoon trade. Argentine FRBs  ARFLC05=RR gained 3/4 to 93, while discount bonds AR425C23=RR rose 1-1/8 to 84-7/8.</p>
<p>The benchmark U.S. Treasury 30-year bond stood 9/32 higher to yield 6.90 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the surge in prices might not be sustainable because the underlying conditions -- concerns that a strong U.S. economy and low unemployment would lead to higher U.S. rates during the summer.  </p>
<p>&quot;I would not be convinced that this is a turning point, because I think the same questions will resurrect themselves,&quot; said Joyce Chang, emerging market debt strategist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Brady bond traders said the scenario would prolong market tensions, as players watched for signs of U.S. inflation for clues to the Fed's next move.</p>
<p>Some analysts suggested that investors might remain cautious, but U.S. portfolio managers said that the gradual pace of the Fed tightening cycle would not defray capital flows to emerging market assets.</p>
<p>Russian debt prices also posted powerful gains, amid good fundamental news and a renewed government commitment to economic reform. Russian IAN paper  RUIAN=RR rose 1-3/4 to 72-3/8 and PRIN  RUPRIN=RR picked up 1-1/2 to 62-1/8.</p>
