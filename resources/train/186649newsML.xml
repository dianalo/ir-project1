<title>SWEDEN: Swedish court hears man spied on fellow Moroccans.</title>
<headline>Swedish court hears man spied on fellow Moroccans.</headline>

<p>A 52-year-old naturalised Swede, originally from Morocco, went on trial on Wednesday charged with spying on fellow Moroccans who opposed the Rabat government.</p>
<p>The prosecution said the defendant, who denied the charge, held a position of trust in a Moroccan organisation in Sweden which he used to denounce supporters of Polisario, an organisation campaigning for autonomy for the Western Sahara.</p>
<p>Sweden's national news agency TT said prosecutor Lars Lundgren told the court that Swedish security police had tapped the man's phone and kept him under surveillance for several years.</p>
<p>During that time the defendant, who was not named as is usual in Swedish court cases, was alleged to have reported on the activities of Polisario supporters to authorities in Rabat.</p>
<p>He occasionally sent information through diplomatic channels using the Moroccan embassy in Sweden, the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>Lundgren showed the court a Swedish television news report and newspaper articles about the political situation in Morocco, and said that supporting Polisario was a punishable offence there.</p>
<p>The defendant and his court-appointed counsel, Thomas Wilton, said the trial was politically inspired and stemmed from Sweden's alleged hostility towards Morocco.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old man admitted forwarding Swedish media reports about Morocco to Rabat but said this did not amount to the charge he faced of illegal information gathering.</p>
<p>The trial continues.</p>
