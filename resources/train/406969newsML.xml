<p>South African gold shares, helped by a weaker rand and a firmer bullion price sparkled towards the close of Thursday's trading session, dealers said.</p>
<p>Industrials were hurt after an overnight dive on Wall Street, a weaker rand and nervousness over comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan late on Wednesday, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been a little bit tired even though the gold price had quite a good run. It (the bullion price) obviously perked up the gold shares but not agressively,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>At 1425 GMT the yellow metal -- which at the start of the week hovered around the $352 level per ounce -- had moved up to $360 per ounce, with dealers commenting that most buyers saw golds as the day's choice on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys are probably selling the industrials and are now focusing on the gold price which has kicked up over the $360 level,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think if the gold price holds these levels New York will push gold shares a little bit better tonight,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>By 1419 GMT about 833 million rand in volume had been traded in the market, they added.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market had discounted most of the economic data released on Thursday, including trade, GDP and inflation figures but would be closely watching January money supply data for direction on Friday.  </p>
<p>They said some volatility could be expected as the market digested Greenspan's comments and the money supply data.</p>
<p>Greenspan warned that U.S. stock prices may have risen too far and hinted that the Federal Reserve could hike U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Preliminary Reserve Bank figures released at 1500 GMT on Thursday -- after the official stock market close -- showed South Africa's year-on-year broadly defined M3 money supply grew 16.89 percent in January, far above a Reuters consensus forecast of 15.8 percent.</p>
<p>Annual private sector credit growth was 17.07 percent against December's revised 16.09, also much higher than the concensus forecast of 15.3 percent.</p>
<p>The gold index ended the day 44.6 points higher -- nearly three percent -- at 1,588.1 while the industrial index sagged 55.1 points to 8,323.7, leaving the overall share index 10.0 points lower at 7,195.7.</p>
<p>Dealers said some of the better traded stocks included Sasol which shed 10 cents to 49.90 rand and Coronation which added 75 cents to 69.75 rand.</p>
<p>Near-dated gold share futures bounced on the back the perkier bullion price while the industrial contract fell on a weaker rand and limited interest.</p>
<p>The gold contract was up at 1,120/33 from 1,088, the March all-share contract was at 1,120/33 from 1,088 and the industrial contract was down at 8,040/57 from 8,119.</p>
