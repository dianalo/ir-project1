<p>France's smallest private general terrestrial television station, M6, is increasing its share of the TV advertising market in line with growth in its audience and improvements in its image, managing director Nicolas de Tavernost said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our turnover is linked to the advertising market in general and M6's share of that market. I can tell you that M6 continues to gain points in this market,&quot; he said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 1997 M6 said it had 16.8 percent of the French TV advertising market, up from 16.7 percent at the end of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The first half was satisfactory for M6. It beat all its audience records in June with a 13.6 percent audience share,&quot; de Tavernost said.</p>
<p>&quot;The channel can reach its objective of a 15 percent audience share and 20 percent among young people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said M6 was in &quot;excellent health&quot; in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>M6 is due to publish its first-half turnover figures in mid-August.</p>
<p>&quot;Our image among French television viewers has made strong progress. This is perhaps a more important factor than the rise in our audience,&quot; de Tavernost said.</p>
<p>M6, owned jointly by Lyonnaise des Eaux and CLT-Audiofina, is the French television channel with the best image, according to the half-yearly barometer carried out by polling institute BVA for advertising industry weekly Strategies.</p>
<p>The barometer, published last Friday, showed that  47 percent of those questioned thought M6's programmes had improved, a rise of seven percent from the previous survey.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's image is tomorrow's audience,&quot; de Tavernost said.</p>
<p>He said M6 was not worried about government plans to put through a broadcasting law in spring 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the government will be careful to see there are no measures which go against the objectives it seeks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The recently elected Socialist government wants to re-introduce a limit of 25 percent for the maximum any single shareholder can own in a media company, regulate regional programming and advertising by national channels, and end the exclusive broadcasting of public French television channels on one of France's three satellite services, Television par Satellite (TPS), in which M6 has a stake.</p>
<p>De Tavernost said a loss of 120 million francs ($20.1 million) which M6 will take in respect of TPS in its 1997 accounts was &quot;an investment&quot;.</p>
<p>He also said he was sticking by a forecast that the cost of M6's 1997 programming will rise by between 4.5 percent and six percent in 1997, compared to a rise of 10.5 percent in 1996. DT/SLA ($ = 5.959 French Francs)</p>
