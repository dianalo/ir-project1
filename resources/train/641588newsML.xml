<title>AUSTRALIA: BHP shares dive after Foster's selloff.</title>
<headline>BHP shares dive after Foster's selloff.</headline>
<dateline>MELBOURNE 1997-06-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd dived 15 cents to A$18.90 after Foster's Brewing Group announced a capital restructuring that would see BHP's shareholding in Foster's dispersed to institutional and retail investors.</p>
<p>Prior to the announcment, BHP shares stood at A$19.05.  </p>
<p>Foster's said its 36.5 percent shareholder Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd would place 86 percent of its 716.6 million Foster's shareholding to institutions at A$2.49 per share with the other 100 million shares offered to BHP shareholders.</p>
<p>BHP said it would recognise a book gain on the sale of its 616 million shares of about A$75 million.</p>
<p>The second part of the restructuring would see Foster's buy back 254.5 million of its shares from Asahi Breweries for A$625 million, paying A$2.49 per share, which represents the bulk of Asahi's 270.3 million shareholding.  </p>
<p>Brokers said the announcement had taken some of the shine off BHP on the day, despite much of the news being well flagged.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a bit surprising and I'm not sure what makes it quite so negative,&quot; said a Sydney-based dealer, noting that the A$2.49 price appeared to be reasonable, given the size of the stakes involved.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think anyone would have been kidding themselves they were going to get a lot higher than that.&quot;</p>
<p>BHP shares ended 14 cents lower at A$18.83 on turnover of 3.5 million shares, while Foster's shares remained under a trading halt after the announcement.  </p>
<p>Prior to the announcement Foster's shares were three cents lower at A$2.60 on turnover of 1.01 million shares.</p>
