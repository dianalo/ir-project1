<title>UK: SPORTS SPONSORS CRACK DOWN ON &quot;AMBUSH MARKETING&quot;.</title>
<headline>SPORTS SPONSORS CRACK DOWN ON &quot;AMBUSH MARKETING&quot;.</headline>

<p>Sports sponsors are increasingly targeting &quot;ambush marketing&quot; in Europe by companies that muscle in on events without paying sponsorship fees, a legal expert said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The top lawyer at ISL Marketing AG, a Swiss-based marketing and sponsorship company, said sports sponsorship was becoming a huge business and sponsors wanted to protect their investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Ambush marketing is very much foul play,&quot; Meena Sayal told an annual conference of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, a trade body with 300 members.</p>
<p>She said ISL, which works with sports federations on sponsorship deals, got help from lawyers, local police and trading standards officers to prevent companies from &quot;hitchhiking a free ride&quot; at the Euro 96 football championship this spring.</p>
<p>The ISL also launched a pan-European campaign to raise awareness of the official sponsors of Euro 96.</p>
<p>Sayal described Nike Inc , the world's biggest athletic footwear maker, as a case study of a company that wrongly targeted consumers outside Euro 96 games, since it was not an official sponsor.</p>
<p>She said Nike had committed an &quot;own goal&quot; because of criticism it subsequently received for its alleged ambush marketing.</p>
<p>&quot;What are the risks to a company that wants to see itself as a global player when federations see it as an ambush marketer? We see it for Nike as an own goal,&quot; Sayal said.</p>
<p>But Nike was unrepentant.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Nike UK Ltd, the UK subsidiary of U.S.-based Nike Inc, told Reuters there was nothing wrong with targeting consumers near Euro 96, as long as Nike didn't claim to be a sponsor.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a more cost-effective way to reach the consumer, rather than paying through the nose to become a sponsor,&quot; Graham Childs said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes we do the official route (and become sponsors) and sometimes we don't...If consumers go to an event, they're fair game,&quot; Childs said in a telephone interview. -- London Advertising Newsdesk +44 171 542 2792</p>
