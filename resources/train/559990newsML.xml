<title>SPAIN: Spanish Treasury bond yields seen down at auction.</title>
<headline>Spanish Treasury bond yields seen down at auction.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spain's Treasury is seen allocating more bonds than expected at its monthly refunding auctions on Tuesday and Wednesday with yields sharply lower than in April, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders were expecting the Treasury to sell between 500 and 600 billion pesetas versus a target of 485 billion announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The bonds are expected to sell with no premium over secondary market prices.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, the three-year 6.75 percent coupon bond was trading at around 5.54 percent versus a 6.224 percent yield showed at the beginning of April.</p>
<p>The five-year yield was at around 5.93 percent versus 6.573 percent, while the 10-year bond was at 6.75 percent versus 7.262 percent. The 15-year was 6.98 percent versus 7.489 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The auctions this week are set to attract enough interest. The market is favourable,&quot; one dealer said &quot;The Treasury can easily reach its target without paying any premium.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Treasury said the maximum amount offered is between 375 billion pesetas in three- and 10-year bonds, and 225 billion pesetas in five- and 15-year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the allocation will be closest to the maximum beacuse they will take advantage of these favourable conditions&quot; a dealer in Madrid said.</p>
<p>Analysts stressed Spain's Treasury is facing a heavy load of maturing paper on June and July, around 5.13 trillion pesetas.</p>
<p>&quot;In June and July, the Treasury has to face heavy refinancing auctions,&quot; said Alfredo Urrutia at Societe Generale in Madrid. &quot;So the more it can issue before, the better,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>From January to April, the Treasury issued in bills, notes and bonds a total of 6.4 billion pesetas.</p>
