<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat appeared set to finally seal a deal giving Palestinians self-rule in the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli and PLO officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross met with both leaders to arrange a summit after negotiators ironed out most details of the deal in talks throughout the day in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Naveh told reporters that time was &quot;almost ripe&quot; for the meeting and Netanyahu's spokesman said the summit would take place on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<p>A PLO official who refused to be identified told Reuters: &quot;The meeting is tomorrow but the time will be set during the Arafat-Ross meeting.&quot;</p>
<p>Underscoring tensions in Hebron, settlers and Palestinians scuffled near a Jewish enclave in the town, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Palestinians said around 15 settlers assaulted two Palestinian youths. One was taken to hospital and police arrested the other, they said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Jewish settlers tried to take over a vacant house before dawn in the Arab casbah.</p>
<p>Israeli security forces made 15 arrests, said the settlers who oppose a handover of any part of the town holy to Moslems and Jews as the burial place of the biblical Abraham.</p>
<p>PLO officials said that whenever a summit took place, negotiators could initial the deal giving Palestinians self-rule in 80 percent of the West Bank town.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement on Hebron has been concluded. The problem is what comes after Hebron. We are still discussing other outstanding issues such as further redeployments and prisoners,&quot; said Major-General Abdel-Razak al-Yahya, a top negotiator.</p>
<p>The head of the PLO negotiating team Saeb Erekat said some outstanding issues must still be resolved by the two leaders.</p>
<p>The PLO wants Israel to free Palestinian prisoners as part of the deal, viewing a release as crucial to winning support for peace deals on the Palestinian street.</p>
<p>Hebron is the last town due to get self-rule but West Bank rural areas remain on the agenda.</p>
<p>Under an Israeli-PLO agreement signed in 1995, Hebron was due to have been given self-rule nine months ago. Officials say a handover could be implemented within hours of any deal.</p>
<p>Security issues have delayed the transfer -- first a wave of Islamist suicide bombings in Israel that killed 59 people and later Netanyahu's demands for better protection for the 400 Jews in the heart of the town of 100,000 Arabs.</p>
<p>The Arab world regards Hebron as a test of Netanyahu's intentions. Although opposed to swapping occupied Arab land for peace, the Likud party leader has promised to uphold the peace deals of the left-leaning government he ousted in May.</p>
<p>Under pressure from Washington, Israel's closest ally, Netanyahu stayed with the negotiations while emphasising that 20 percent of the town, including Hebron's Jews and Abraham's tomb, will remain under Israeli control.</p>
<p>In a message delivered by Ross, President Bill Clinton praised Netanyahu for &quot;decisions which the prime minister made in order to advance the peace talks&quot; and invited him to Washington.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Mary Ellen Glynn said Clinton was &quot;encouraged&quot; about chances for a Hebron deal.</p>
