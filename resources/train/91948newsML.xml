<headline>OFT completes BA/American alliance study.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said on Tuesday it had completed a three-month competition investigation into the proposed alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp, and had forwarded its review to the trade ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;I can confirm that the papers left for the Department of Trade today,&quot; an OFT spokeswoman told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Trade minister Ian Lang will use the OFT's advice in deciding whether or not the controversial alliance should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a full monopolies probe.</p>
<p>Industry sources, who predicted that the OFT would complete its study this week, have said they do not expect Lang to announce his verdict before next week.</p>
<p>Recent media and industry speculation has suggested that Lang will give the alliance qualified clearance, provided that BA's home hub of London Heathrow is opened up to competition.  </p>
<p>BA and American's plans have attracted fierce criticism from rival airlines as well as consumer groups and travel agents, who say the alliance will dominate the London trans-Atlantic market.</p>
<p>Under the link-up, BA intends to coordinate its 244 weekly flights from Britain to 22 U.S. destinations with all American's 238 flights from seven US airports to 12 European destinations.</p>
<p>They would also combine their frequent flyer programmes and share flight booking codes to promote their connecting flights on computer reservation systems, and combine cargo businesses.</p>
<p>BA and American argue their deal will lead to greater competition on British transatlantic routes because it will only go ahead if Britain and the U.S. liberalise the market with an &quot;open skies&quot; trade pact.</p>
<p>At the same time they say they need to link to compete against rival alliances such as that between United Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa for all-important transfer traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;Open skies&quot; talks between government negotiators, which need to succeed before Washington can consider giving the plan much-needed anti-trust immunity, broke down last month but there has been strong industry speculation that they will be reopened shortly, with some concessions, once the OFT verdict is known.</p>
