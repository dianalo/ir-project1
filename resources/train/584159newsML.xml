<headline>Swedish PM says to announce EMU view by end of May.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1997-05-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sweden's Prime Minister Goran Persson said on Wednesday his ruling Social Democratic party would announce its view on membership of Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU) by the end of May.</p>
<p>He also dismissed as speculation a newspaper report saying he was more negative to EMU than he officially has said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Before the end of this month, the Social Democratic party will announce its stance (on EMU membership),&quot; Persson told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;That is what we have said for a long time and we will stick to that.&quot;</p>
<p>Other government members have been vague lately and talked about an announcement in a few weeks' time.</p>
<p>Persson could not give an exact date but said the announcement would be made either before or after May 23, but not on May 23 as it would collide with a European Council meeting.</p>
<p>Persson also dismissed a Wednesday article in Svenska Dagbladet which quoted sources as saying Persson and Finance Minister Erik Asbrink were more negative to EMU membership than they pretend to be.</p>
<p>A source from the party told the newspaper that the two ministers will not openly admit that they are against a Swedish EMU membership as they fear interest rates will rise.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumours, rumours, rumours,&quot; Persson said. &quot;There are too many rumours and too few facts on this discussion.&quot;</p>
