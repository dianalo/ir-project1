<headline>Intl analysts see faith in Kenyan shilling dented.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-01</dateline>

<p>International confidence in the Kenyan shilling  has suffered a severe blow from an International Monetary Fund decision  to curtail its lending to the east African country, traders and analysts  in London said.</p>
<p>The shilling, which lost more than five percent against the dollar  after the IMF announcement late on Thursday, stabilised between 60  and 62 per dollar by midday in Europe on Friday.</p>
<p>But risks remain of a further blow-out, traders said</p>
<p>Caution about central bank intervention helped shore up the currency  for now, but analysts said foreign investors would probably be best  advised to cut short-term holdings.</p>
<p>&quot;This (IMF decision) is a big dent to overseas confidence in the currency,&quot;  said Nick Douch, corporate risk adviser at BZW in London. &quot;IMF endorsement  is seen by most people as a good housekeeping guarantee and Kenya  has just lost it.&quot;</p>
<p>At 1006 GMT, the shilling was quoted at 60.25/61.25 per dollar compared  with 59.00/59.50 at the open in Nairobi. The dollar/shilling rate  hit a high at 81.60 in June 1993.</p>
<p>An IMF spokesman in Washington said on Thursday a $205 million three-year  loan, offered under the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility,  would be allowed to lapse because the government's response to a July  24 deadline had been inadequate.</p>
<p>On Friday, Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said the government  would cut spending and raise revenues to cover budget shortfalls caused  by the IMF decision and added the market forces would be allowed to  prevail on the currency.</p>
<p>&quot;There's really nothing the central bank can do here if, as now seems  likely, foreign money decides to cut and run. Many people will now  probably stay out until at least after the general election later  this year,&quot; said an exotic currencies trader at a UK bank in London.</p>
<p>No date yet has been set for the general election but it is expected  by December.</p>
<p>Central Bank of Kenya Governor Micah Cheserem said on Friday the central  bank was weighing whether to intervene to support the Kenyan shilling  but it was not prudent to attempt to stop a stampede because it might  only add to the shilling's weakness.</p>
<p>The Kenyan shilling has lost more than 14 percent of its value against  the dollar since the violent clashes between pro-reform demonstrators  and police in early July.</p>
<p>The IMF decision, rumoured for weeks, may finally force many investors  to make an exit, said traders.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people have held onto shilling positions on the argument that  it will rebound again soon but my personal feeling is the risk is  too high and very high pain thresholds will be needed to stay in,&quot;  said Douch at BZW.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation looks suspiciously like the rand blow-out in 1996,  where people constantly looked for the rebound, which was a long time  coming.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said most foreign money in the shilling, a freely traded  currency, was in the form of short-term Treasury bills. With yields  in excess of 20 percent and the shilling broadly stable in the mid-50s  to the dollar for the past two years, these instruments proved attractive  to overseas investors looking for interest rate carry trades.</p>
<p>Yield-hungry UK and U.S. investors in particular have been pulled  in, they said.</p>
<p>The bulk of shilling trading is conducted via Nairobi but much of  the trading overseas is in non-deliverable forwards of NDFs. NDFs  allow investors to play the forward shilling market without taking  hold of shillings.</p>
<p>NDFs are effectively a contract for differences in shilling prices  but deliverable in a major currency like the dollar. This avoids settlement,  convertibility and liquidity risks of exposure to the local currency,  said analysts.</p>
