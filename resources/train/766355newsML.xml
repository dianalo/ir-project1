<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks close down ahead of economic data.</title>
<headline>Thai stocks close down ahead of economic data.</headline>

<p>Concerns over the economy along with the upcoming implementation of a new rule on market trading limits prompted investors to sell and bring the Thai stock market to close down slightly on Wednesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors slowed down their buying because of worries about the country's economy, especially on foreign reserves. They're waiting for the figures to be released by the central bank tomorrow,&quot; said Surachai Pramualcharoenkit of Multi-Credit Corp of Thailand.</p>
<p>The composite SET index closed 2.63 points lower at 679.53 on 4.9 billion baht turnover.  </p>
<p>Economists and analysts expect the Thai June foreign reserves figures to drop to between $25-31 billion from $33.3 billion in May after weeks of a currency war waged by the authorities with baht speculators.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand is believed to have spent hefty sums of its foreign reserves to defend the baht in May and June before it floated the currency on July 2.</p>
<p>Brokers said turnover was a bit thin on Wednesday because investors were also awaiting the implementation of the new market rule which would increase upper and lower trading limits to 30 percent from 10 percent starting on Friday.  </p>
<p>Brokers said they believed foreigners continued buying on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Foreigners have been buying actively since the baht was floated on July 2. On Tuesday, their total net buying amounted to 2.5 billion baht.</p>
<p>The SET-50 index lost 0.38 point to 51.79.</p>
<p>Several key sectors declined on profit-taking. The finance sector was the most active counter in terms of value, rising 0.80 percent. The banking sector lost 0.62 percent and the communication counter shed 1.62 percent.  </p>
<p>Many large capitalised stocks retreated. Thai Farmers Bank topped the active list in terms of value, falling three baht to 117, followed by Bangkok Bank, which declined four to 175, and Advanced Info, which lost 18 to 242.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected the market to dip slightly on Thursday on concerns over key economic indicators.</p>
