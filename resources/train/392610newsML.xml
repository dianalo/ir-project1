<headline>Three die in Egypt police, militants shootout.</headline>
<dateline>ASSIUT, Egypt 1997-02-20</dateline>

<p>Three people were killed and several others wounded on Thursday in a shootout between Egyptian police and suspected Moslem militants outside the southern village of Ashmouneen, security sources said.</p>
<p>They said the clash broke out when  police went to some fields of Ashmouneen after they were tipped off that militants were hiding there. The sources said police were still surrounding the fields.</p>
<p>Ashmouneen is near the militant hotbed of Mallawi, some 260 km (160 miles) south of Cairo.</p>
<p>Police shot dead Ahmed Sayed, identified as a leading member of the southern wing of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group).</p>
<p>Suspected police informers Khalaf Mohamed and Mohamed Ali Bikheit were also killed in the clash, the sources added, but it was not clear who shot them. Militants have in the past targeted people they suspected of helping the police.</p>
<p>The Gama'a has been fighting since 1992 to topple the Egyptian government and set up a purist Islamic state.</p>
<p>They have concentrated their recent activities in the south, targetting policemen, officials and sometimes Christians in their armed campaign. Police believe that Gama'a members shot dead 10 Christians in a church further north in Minya.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people have been killed and scores more wounded in five years of political violence.</p>
