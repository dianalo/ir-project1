<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends higher, spot premium widens.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends higher, spot premium widens.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-03</dateline>

<p>CSCE coffee prices strode higher again on Thursday, as renewed concern about near-term supplies fueled aggressive buying of the spot contract month, trading sources said.</p>
<p>The stock jitters, which were revived earlier in the week when the CSCE reported deliverable inventories had fallen to their lowest level in more than a decade, drove the spot December contract to its highest settlement in four weeks.</p>
<p>Benchmark December futures rose a solid 2.05 cents per lb on the day, to 107.45 cents, having ranged from 105.10 to 107.70. Buying on the deferreds was more cautious, with second-position March gaining 1.50, to 102.30.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a real tightness is the physical market,&quot; said Victor Henriquez, president of trading firm Hencorp Becstone.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't see any coffee coming in yet from Central America...and roasters need to start buying as the weather turns colder and demand picks up.&quot;</p>
<p>The sharp downturn in weekly certified stocks was the main impetus behind the widening spot-month premium, he added. December-March swelled to 5.15 cents Thursday, compared with 3.45 cents at the start of the week.  </p>
<p>But analysts said coffee would need to punch through the 108-110 cent area in the next several days to sustain the bullish trend. And as long as producer-countries remained eager sellers at the highs, the uptrend may be short-lived, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It does look like we have built a nice base,&quot; said Jim Cordier, analyst with Allendale Commodities. &quot;(But) we're getting overbought, going sideways for the past two weeks, and December desperately needs a close over 110 cents.&quot;</p>
<p>In the options ring, straddles were well traded at 90-115 cents, generating additional speculative interest on the futures, traders said. November coffee options expire on Friday. Volume was estimated at 6,852 lots.</p>
