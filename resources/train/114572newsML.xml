<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish bonds make small gains, eye economic data.</title>
<headline>Irish bonds make small gains, eye economic data.</headline>
<dateline>DUBLIN 1996-10-14</dateline>

<p>Irish government bonds began the week with small gains in thin trade on Monday as the market focused on a week of important data, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ireland has overperformed the rest of Europe so far today but trade is still disappointingly sluggish. The U.S. holiday has put a damper on market activity. The Irish market will be letting the week's data set the tone,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>By 1537 GMT, the eight percent bond due 2000 had edged up 17p from Friday's close to 107.07 to yield 5.88 percent while the 8.00 percent bond due 2006 had notched up a gain of 12 pence to 107.92 to yield 6.75 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;What the Irish market needs now is a return to convergence trading which would prop up peripheral markets like us. Last week saw many buyers losing interest in Irish bonds and switching to UK gilts. It will be interesting to see what trends emerge this week,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>In the UK, gilts ended slightly higher in quiet trade, muted by a public holiday in the U.S.</p>
<p>Earlier, gilts saw light losses when September PPI data showed a monthly input increase of 0.3 percent and a monthly output rise of 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>In a busy week for overseas economic data, dealers said short term focus would fall on Wednesday's public spending, unemployment and earnings data in Britain.</p>
