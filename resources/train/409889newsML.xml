<p>NWE naphtha prices tumbled to their weakest levels since last August and swaps inverted into contango on a host of bearish fundamentals that punctuated a three-week downtrend, traders said.</p>
<p>Weaker crude oil futures, ample supply in Northwest Europe, traders pressuring the swaps to capitalise on cargoes they hold in the Mediterranean, and signs that end-users were looking at alternative feedstocks -- all were cited as reasons for the sharp naphtha drop.</p>
<p>One end-user said that because of the contango, traders were trying to place vessels for the first half of March instead of the second half, further hurting prices.</p>
<p>He said traders were still trying to ship Med cargoes to the Far East, but the arbitrage had already shut.</p>
<p>March swaps last traded $11.50 lower at $192/$193 a tonne and April dropped $7.50 to $193/$194. The swaps were in backwardation of $3-$4 just a few days ago.</p>
<p>NWE cargoes were notionally valued at $191/$195 cif.</p>
<p>The end-user said a 5,000-10,000 tonne Russian cargo was offered at $195 cif, with the closest bid under $190.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say it's an oversupplied market,&quot; the end-user said. He said he was starting to look at LPG as an alternative feedstock for March, which could replace a cargo of naphtha, but that he had not bought any yet.</p>
<p>Two to three cargoes of 20,000-30,000 tonnes were trying to be placed for the first half of the month, but the end-user said his needs were already covered.</p>
