<title>BELGIUM: Options expiry could rattle confident Bel-20.</title>
<headline>Options expiry could rattle confident Bel-20.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-06-20</dateline>

<p>Belgian share traders, inspired by fresh gains on Wall Street and confident because of strong technical support for the market, said they expected the bourse to remain in positive territory on Friday.</p>
<p>The only element of uncertainty came from the expiry of options at 1230 GMT. &quot;This afternoon market makers in the Bel-20 will certainly try to manipulate prices,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>At 0855 GMT the Bel-20 index was up 0.37 percent at 2,354.30 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said underlying sentiment remained bullish after a four-day correction earlier this week.  </p>
<p>Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) was one of only three Bel-20 losers.</p>
<p>It was down 120 francs, or 1.2 percent, at 9,540 francs after it already surrendered 140 francs on Thursday following a magazine interview with chief executive officer Michel Tilmant who reiterated that the so-called Great Belgian bank project was in the freezer.</p>
<p>Belgium's third largest bank Kredietbank by contrast was up 0.5 percent, recovering from selling after a newspaper interview in which it re-affirmed it would prefer to remain independent, quashing merger speculation.  </p>
<p>One dealer was sceptical. He said the big banks were playing a major game of chess and were merely stressing their independence &quot;to drive up the price&quot; for takeover candidates.</p>
<p>&quot;They're just using the media to play their game,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chemicals and drugs firm UCB, which soared to a June 13 record of 122,000 francs before sliding to a close of 112,900 on Thursday, was up 1.4 percent at 114,500.</p>
