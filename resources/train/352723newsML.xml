<title>JAPAN: Impact of fire on Toyota business limited-analysts.</title>

<p>Toyota Motor Corp's bottom line will not suffer any major ill effects even if the car maker suspends domestic production as a result of a fire at a key car parts supplier, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;An output suspension for a few days or even a week is unlikely to cause any decline in Toyota's earnings to below the company's forecast this financial year,&quot; said Hideaki Aonuma, an industry analyst at Societe Generale Securities.</p>
<p>A fire at a plant of Aisin Seiki Co Ltd on Saturday halted output of some brake parts supplied to Toyota, forcing Toyota to suspend operations at one of its domestic factories in Kyushu, southern Japan, on Monday.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Toyota said that it may be forced to suspend its domestic production for a full day on Tuesday due to the fire.</p>
<p>A Toyota spokesman told Reuters that the company would restart some of its production lines from Wednesday and that it had decided to drop plans to operate its factories for an extra day next Saturday. He said the impact of the suspension on Toyota's earnings was unclear. Toyota produces about 14,000 cars per day at its 12 plants in Japan.</p>
<p>Societe Generale's Aonuma, meanwhile, said that Toyota's earnings for the year to March may not come in any lower than the company's own forecast even if the car maker were to halt domestic production for a week.  </p>
<p>Toyota's domestic output has so far remained at or above the company's target and the weaker yen will also help support its profits by boosting export income, Aonuma said.</p>
<p>Aonuma said that Toyota was also good at managing risks and would ask its group companies, like Denso Corp, to provide necessary car parts. &quot;The remaining issue for Toyota is how to get necessary materials,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Denso said that it was already preparing to supply auto parts to Aisin's customers on its behalf, but declined to give the likely volume or time. Toyota holds a 23.2 percent stake in Denso and 22.6 percent in Aisin.  </p>
<p>Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics said in a report on Monday that Aisin's operations would likely return to normal within a week and the output shortage caused by the fire may be recouped by overtime and holiday staffing.</p>
<p>The fire may only have limited damage on Aisin's business for 1996/97, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The company may suffer higher labour costs...but it is likely to attain its own current profit target of 17 billion yen for 1996/97,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The estimated damage from the fire -- about 1.5 billion yen -- would be posted as a special loss, but the loss may be somewhat offset from likely insurance payouts so that the impact on Aisin's net profit would also be limited, it said.</p>
<p>Shares in Toyota fell on Monday, depressed by profit-taking after news that it may suspend domestic output for a day. As of 0545 GMT, the shares were down 30 yen at 3,100 yen with the turnover of 2.02 million.</p>
<p>Shares in Aisin Seiki, meanwhile, dropped 120 yen to 1,650 yen as of 0547 GMT on turnover of 1.38 million shares.</p>
