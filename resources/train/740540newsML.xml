<headline>Taiwan dlr ends higher on central bank resolve.</headline>

<p>The Taiwan dollar closed higher against its U.S. counterpart on Friday as the central bank's recent rate-stabilising resolve eased speculative pressure against the local currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>The local unit, bobbing in a narrow range throughout the session, closed at T$27.926 against Thursday's T$27.939 finish.</p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was relatively active at US$322 million.  </p>
<p>Central bank vice governor Liang Cheng-chin said late on Thursday that the bank would marshal &quot;appropriate measures&quot; if foreign exchange speculators resumed recent efforts to pressure the local currency lower.</p>
<p>Liang added the kind of currency crisis that has hit Thailand and the Philippines &quot;could never happen&quot; in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar, which has faced downward pressure in July due to some speculative buying of non-delivery forwards and the general strength of the U.S. dollar against the yen, averted a fall on Thursday following what dealers described as clear central bank intervention.  </p>
<p>&quot;The central bank's recent efforts apparently paid off, as the market seemed unwilling to chase after a higher U.S. dollar,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The speculators tested the central bank's attitude, and the central bank made it clear,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the Taiwan dollar to resume a downtrend for the near term -- but only a mild descend deemed acceptable by the central bank.</p>
<p>A T$27.92-95 range was seen for Saturday.</p>
