<p>The Indonesian rupiah took centre stage in a still nervous Asian foreign exchange market on Wednesday, plunging to a historic low and forcing a defensive interest rate rise and central bank intervention.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia was forced to step in after the rupiah shrugged off the rate rise and dropped to the lower limit of its 12 percent trading band.</p>
<p>It fell to a low of 2,682 to the dollar in the afternoon before recovering on the intervention to 2,640/50. The bank's intervention band, the parameters outside of which it will enter the market, was last pegged at 2,378/2,682.</p>
<p>But intervention could well be a losing battle given the continuing weakness in all Southeast Asian currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;It's useless for the central bank to intervene in a bearish market,&quot; said Jimmy Koh, regional economist for the I.D.E.A. research consultancy. He noted that the Malaysian central bank had spent some $8.8 billion in intervention measures when the ringgit was under attack earlier this month, but with little to show for its efforts.</p>
<p>The rate rise came as a bit of a surprise as the very rates which were cut last Friday by 50 basis points were raised 100 basis points, so on a net basis policy is tighter now.</p>
<p>&quot;They are raising short-term rates but keeping the long-term rates, which determine lending and spending behaviour in the economy, at current levels,&quot; said Manu Bhaskaran, Group Head of Research at SocGen Crosby.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank has a clear strategy and I think they will use short-term rates where necessary to hold the currency.&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Singapore dollar remained under pressure but recouped some of its losses on talk of possible central bank intervention near its low of 1.5175 to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>It was at a late 1.5100 where dealers said there are strong bids for U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>They said local banks were seen selling the U.S. dollar near its highs earlier, often an indication of the central bank's presence, but no confirmation was available.</p>
<p>A European bank dealer said the U.S. dollar would be bought on any dips to 1.5100 or 1.5050 for an eventual move up to 1.53.</p>
<p>The Malaysian ringgit moved narrowly but showed persistent signs of weakness and dealers said the market was likely to take a crack at the 2.80 level, a low not seen since the ringgit was officially floated in 1973.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/ringgit could still reach 2.80 and probably go above that level,&quot; said a Malaysian bank dealer. &quot;But I'm expecting some resistance at 2.7850.&quot;</p>
<p>The ringgit was quoted at 2.7775 to the dollar against 2.7645/75 at the close of Kuala Lumpur trade on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Thai baht started easier but regained its composure to trade at a late 31.430 onshore and 31.350 offshore.</p>
<p>Dealers said there were some sales of dollars offshore ahead of the expected mid-August maturity of short baht forward positions, established when the Thai currency came under speculative attack three months ago.</p>
<p>The Philippine peso remained weak as banks bought up the dollar in volatile regional currency markets.</p>
<p>Corporate customers are also looking to buy dollars at the moment and that was keeping the pressure on the peso, dealers said.</p>
<p>The peso was at 28.85 against its previous close at 28.66. Manila traders said the central bank might have sold dollars at the 28.70/28.78 levels earlier but no confirmation was available.</p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar remained weak but fears of central bank intervention and tight liquidity in domestic money markets helped limit any decline. It was at a late 28.726 per U.S. dollar, little changed from Tuesday's close.</p>
