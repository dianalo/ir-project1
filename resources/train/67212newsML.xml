<p>International Business Machines Corp. will extend health benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian employees, making it the largest U.S. company to date to adopt such a policy.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the world's largest computer maker said Friday the company would extend health coverage to same-sex domestic partners during its annual enrollment period between Oct. 1 and Oct. 31.</p>
<p>The benefits cover health, dental and vision plans offered by the company and would take effect July 1, 1997, IBM spokeswoman Melinda McMullen said.</p>
<p>She said the policy change brings the Armonk, N.Y.-based company into line with its own written policy of non-discrimination that has included sexual orientation since 1974.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman also said the move was designed to keep IBM competitive with other high-tech firms with such policies, including Microsoft Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.</p>
<p>&quot;The competition to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is fierce in the high technology business,&quot; the spokeswoman said. &quot;So it made sense from a competitive business standpoint as well.&quot;</p>
<p>A legal group that represents gays and lesbians welcomed the IBM move.</p>
<p>&quot;Big Blue is in good company with nearly 500 employers that offer similar benefits,&quot; Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund spokeswoman Peg Byron said. &quot;Popular culture and many in the private sector recognize that lesbians and gays should have equal treatment and Congress will catch on soon.&quot;</p>
<p>The IBM policy does not cover unmarried heterosexual couples who live together because they have the option of marriage.</p>
<p>&quot;What we require of all our employees is proof of commitment. The acknowledged proof of committment among heterosexuals is marriage,&quot; the IBM spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Last week the U.S. Senate, by a wide margin, passed a bill that would deny recognition of same-sex marriages. On the same day however, it narrowly defeated a bill prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>
<p>In the absence of laws allowing gays and lesbians to marry, IBM said it would require employees with same-sex domestic partners to present a notorized affidavit that they are involved in a committed relationship, living in the same household, and that their finances are interdependent.</p>
<p>McMullen noted that such documents were unlikely to be entered into lightly, since they have been used as evidence in some so-called palimony cases recently. She said very few employees were expected to benefit from the policy change.</p>
<p>IBM also extended its health benefit plans to cover employees who care for a dependent child, even if the employee is not a biological or adopted parent of the child.</p>
<p>For example, an aunt would be covered if she had taken into her house a niece or nephew. Young people up to 23 years old who are financially dependent on an IBM employee would qualify.</p>
