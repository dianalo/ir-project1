<title>UK: US payrolls to steal UK gilts' election thunder.</title>
<headline>US payrolls to steal UK gilts' election thunder.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Any post-election flurry in British gilts next Friday will be cut short by the release of U.S. April payrolls on the other side of the Atlantic, analysts said.</p>
<p>Not even the prospect of the first change in British government for 18 years will be enough to keep the spotlight on domestic politics for long as worries about another U.S. interest rate rise take precedence.</p>
<p>Combine that with a public holiday in Britain the following Monday, and trade will be stifled.</p>
<p>&quot;Because the result of the election is so widely expected, we may find people won't get too excited and will use the prospect of the payrolls figures to hold fire a bit,&quot; said one trader here.</p>
<p>&quot;And with a public holiday in Britain on the following Monday, who's going to want to take a position ahead of that and payrolls?&quot;</p>
<p>Societe Generale gilts analyst Tom Rayner agreed any nasty surprises for payrolls would far outweigh domestic politics.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as there's a clear majority, and we're assuming Labour will get in, we're looking for a fairly positive reaction in gilts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But in terms of absolute gains, if the U.S. data is as strong as we think it will be, that will take the shine off gilts. You're just not going to see gilts rallying when you've got a big fall in the Treasury market.&quot;</p>
<p>Rayner said volumes may also be curtailed by the fact many European players may extend a Thursday holiday into a long weekend.</p>
<p>Yamaichi International bond strategist Adam Chester agreed the market had largely priced in a Labour victory, so attention would soon turn to the U.S. data.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has pretty much priced Labour getting in so we'll get back to normal and look at payrolls in the afternoon,&quot; he said. --Jennifer Scott, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682</p>
