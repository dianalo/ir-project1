<p>U.S. Midcontinent spot unleaded gasoline basis was unchanged late Tuesday in Chicago with few deals heard done, although buyers and sellers were emerging in the market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been just dead quite,&quot; said one trader, who expected the talk to heat up as traders returned from the American Petroleum Institute annual conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trade in Chicago unleaded has been thin since last Friday, when an Illinois court cleared the way for Clark Refining and Marketing Co to restart two units idled since an October 19 fire.  </p>
<p>The outage boosted differentials on November barrels to 8.25 cents a gallon over the print and sent buyers to the sidelines, where they have been waiting for basis to ease.</p>
<p>Stocks remained tight in the region, but Clark said it planned to double gasoline output to 2 million gallons a day as it brought the idled units back on line.</p>
<p>Chicago unleaded was unchanged at 7.25 cents a gallon over the print bid, 8.25 cents asked for prompt deliveries and two cents weaker for later deliveries, traders said.</p>
<p>Group Three unleaded was steady at 4.25/4.50 cents a gallon over NYMEX December unleaded for prompt deliveries and 1.50/1.75 cents over for later deliveries.</p>
<p>High sulphur diesel was talked 1.75/2.0 cents a gallon over the print in Chicago and 2.0 cents over in Group Three, unchanged on the day.</p>
<p>Chicago low sulphur diesel for later deliveries was heard done 2.75 cents a gallon over NYMEX December heating oil early in the day, with prompt deliveries talked one cent stronger.</p>
<p>Group Three low sulphur was unchanged at 3.75/4.0 cents a gallon over the print for prompt deliveries and 1.50/1.75 cents a gallon over for later deliveries.</p>
<p>Jet/kero basis remained 3.50/3.75 cents over the print in Chicago and 2.75/3.0 cents over in Group Three.</p>
