<p>Aiming to bring entertainment from the silver screen to consumers on the Intel platform, Intel Corp said Monday that it invested $14.75 million in Avid Technologies Inc.</p>
<p>The investment, in which Intel will purchase 1,552,632 newly issued shares of Avid valued at $9.50 a share based on the stock's Friday close, jumped 1-3/4 to 11-1/4.</p>
<p>The companies said in a joint news conference here that the investment was part of a strategic alliance supporting Avid's plans to offer video and audio editing products on the Intel architecture.  </p>
<p>The Tewksbury, Mass.-based video and audio production equipment supplier has been challenged by the shift in the entertainment market away from traditional platforms, such as Apple Computer Inc's AAPL.O Macintosh systems.</p>
<p>William Miller, chairman and chief executive of Avid, said the company was still &quot;actively working&quot; on supporting Apple's new Rhapsody system software, which will include features from NeXT, the private company Apple acquired in December.</p>
<p>But he said he expects &quot;a very powerful solution across a broad range of Intel-based platforms.&quot;  </p>
<p>Miller said Avid already supports the Intel platform with several products, including MCXpress, NewsView and Elastic Reality - the latter providing warping and morphing capabilities.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the two companies said they will work together to bring a broader range of additional digital content creation products to Intel-based PCs.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly want to work together to make the Intel platform just as good as it can possibly be,&quot; Miller said.  </p>
<p>The deal, unveiled at Intel's &quot;platforms for visual computing&quot; conference here, is part of Intel's effort to launch itself into the world of Hollywood entertainment.</p>
<p>Craig Barrett, Intel's chief operating officer and president-elect, said the company expects its machines equipped with its processors to be used for authoring as well as playing multimedia content in coming years.</p>
<p>Miller said he anticipates this will extend beyond Hollywood, to businesses and eventually home users, who could, for example, post video recordings of a child's birthday party on the Internet for family to see.  </p>
<p>&quot;We intend to aggressively expand our capabilities on the Intel architecture,&quot; Miller said, adding the company will expand its distribution capabilities aimed at the use of Intel-based personal computers.</p>
<p>Miller declined to discuss specific product plans, but said interested parties should &quot;stay tuned&quot; for products.</p>
<p>Ronald Whittier, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's content group, said &quot;Avid has a certain set of capabilities, customers and clients that are very important to Intel as well.&quot;</p>
