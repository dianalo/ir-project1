<title>USA: US spot Midco gasoline diffs widen late day.</title>
<headline>US spot Midco gasoline diffs widen late day.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-08</dateline>

<p>U.S. spot gasoline prices gained ground late Tuesday on a combination of moderately higher NYMEX futures and firmer diffs in Group Three and Chicago, players said.</p>
<p>Group Three conventional unleaded was offered at 0.20 cents below May futures, a half cent firmer than midday diffs and one cent firmer than late Monday.</p>
<p>And diffs on Chicago material widened 0.25 cent from midday, recouping about half the differential losses seen earlier in the day, players said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of expectation there will be lower gasoline stocks in the Williams System the second half of April,&quot; one trader said, which supported Chicago diffs.</p>
<p>Traders noted API data released late Tuesday showed a 1.2 million barrel draw on U.S. gasoline stocks for the week ending April 4, but predicted the bullish fundamental would be largely offset by ramped up gasoline production.</p>
<p>The API data showed total U.S. gasoline output surging to 7.7 million barrels per day, a 632,000-barrel increase over the prior week.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders said partial restoration of Intercontinental Pipe Line crude flow downstream of Superior, Wisconsin, was having little immediate impact on refined product prices.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have a shortage of crude so we can wipe concerns off our brow,&quot; one Midco trader said, noting crude built by one million barrels last week, according to the API data -- with current stocks 9 million barrels above this time last year.</p>
<p>Part of the IPL crude pipeline, which supplies about 1.4 million barrels a day to midwestern U.S. refiners, was shut from late Saturday evening as a number of pumping stations in Minnesota were knocked out by a power outage there.</p>
<p>Refineries in the large states around the Great Lakes account for about 2.3 million barrels a day of crude processing, or about 15 percent of the U.S. total.</p>
<p>IPL said Tuesday it had restarted Lines 2 and 3, which carry crude to Superior from Edmonton, Alberta, but only at sharply reduced flows.</p>
