<title>USA: GM sports cars cited for high death rates.</title>
<headline>GM sports cars cited for high death rates.</headline>

<p>General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet Camaro was cited by auto insurers Thursday as the passenger vehicle with the most driver deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles.</p>
<p>Another GM car, the Corvette, was also cited by the insurance industry-backed Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for its high driver death rate.</p>
<p>&quot;The high rates in these two vehicles are in part because of their over-involvement in high-speed, single-vehicle accidents,&quot; the institute said.</p>
<p>Joining the Camaro and Corvette with very high driver death rates were the Geo Tracker, a utility vehicle made for GM by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp., and the Hyundai Scoupe, a small two-door car made by Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. of South Korea.</p>
<p>The ratings of 153 passenger vehicles showed that in general larger cars were safer than smaller ones.</p>
<p>These results, said institute President Brian O'Neill, &quot;reinforce the conclusion that bigger is better when it comes to protecting people in passenger vehicles from crash deaths and injuries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's a clear problem with small passenger vehicles as a group,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>O'Neill said, &quot;The vehicles with the highest, or worst, driver death rates are small two-door cars, small pickups, small utility vehicles, and sports cars. The ones with the lowest, or best, death rates tend to be the large passenger vans, large station wagons, large and midsize luxury cars, and large utility vehicles.&quot;</p>
<p>With the institute's rating based on 100 as an average for all passenger vehicles, the Camaro scored 297, nearly three times the average, the Corvette 250; the Tracker 271 and the Scoupe 245.</p>
<p>The range of averages for categories of vehicles, not including individual vehicles rated, was from 45 to 191.</p>
