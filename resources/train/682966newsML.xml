<title>PHILIPPINES: APC diversification to bear fruits in 98.</title>
<headline>APC diversification to bear fruits in 98.</headline>
<dateline>MANILA 1997-06-24</dateline>

<p>The recent diversification of APC Group Inc is expected to bear fruits starting next year, APC Chairman Jaime Gonzalez said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;1997 will still be a transition period for us,&quot; Gonzalez told analysts and reporters, after he announced the recently-converted holding company posted a meagre 38 million pesos last year, up from 10 million pesos the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;By 1998, there should be a significant income already, especially from PhilCom,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>PhilCom or Philippine Global Communications Inc is one of the three major projects embarked by the former oil exploration firm.</p>
<p>APC had invested 1.69 billion pesos to acquire 40 percent of the international gateway operator. It has an option to buy an additional 22 percent stake in the company.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said the recent joint venture with Germany's Philipp Holzmann AG had already bagged three construction contracts.</p>
<p>The steady income stream would be further boosted when the APC Cement Corp becomes operational by the end of 1999. The 1999 timetable was based on the assumption that the company would secure all the government clearances by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The major cement plant, which is projected to cost $260 million, will have a rated capacity of 4,500 tonnes per day or 1.5 million tonnes of cement every year.</p>
<p>&quot;Negotiations with well-known, highly respected international companies engaged in energy generation and in commodities distribution are ongoing,&quot; Gonzalez also said.</p>
<p>&quot;Upon successful conclusion of these negotiations, we shall have positioned the company among the major industrial forces in the Philippine economy.&quot;</p>
<p>The company is actively looking for prospective buyers of all its oil interests. &quot;APC hopes that it can completely divest itself of its oil exploration interests in 1997,&quot; he added.</p>
