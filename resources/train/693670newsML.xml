<p>September Bund futures will meet strong resistance in the area around 102.00 on Friday and will head lower if it defeats them, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bunds have reached their big barrier at 101.95 to 102.05 and I reckon they ought to sell off from there,&quot; said David Wood, an independant technical analsyt near London.</p>
<p>But he said if the contract could hold above 101.77 to 101.72 on Friday it would keep the pressure on those upper limits.</p>
<p>At 0654 GMT September Bund futures were at 101.92, up four basis points on the day.  </p>
<p>The contract pushed up to test 101.95 on Thursday and has touched a high so far on Friday at 101.98.</p>
<p>Wood said a close above 102.05 for this session would be a bullish sign.</p>
<p>&quot;We would have to think the contract has more steam in it, but I'm not really considering that at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Technical analysts at a European bank in London said there was potential resistance in the 102.00 area, &quot;although 102.50 looks more interesting -- the top of a small trend channel,&quot; they added in a note to clients.</p>
<p>&quot;Momentum is not yet notably overbought.&quot;  </p>
<p>They said Bunds needed to hold above 101.55/60 to maintain their positive stance.</p>
<p>To the downside Wood also set support in this region.</p>
<p>&quot;It is all concentrated into an eight tick band between 101.62 to 101.54,&quot; he said. &quot;It looks pretty good on hourly charts as we have been making lows there for the last three days.&quot;</p>
<p>He said a break below that region would confirm 101.95 to 102.05 as a significant barrier and open up the potential back to a big support level at 101.00.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is quite a battle going on in the longer term between 102.00 and 101.00,&quot; said Wood.</p>
<p>At the short end December Euromarks were at 96.76, up one basis point from Thursday's close.</p>
