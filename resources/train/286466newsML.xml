<headline>FOCUS - Wall Street rebound sparks Euroshare rally.</headline>

<p>European shares rallied in early business on Friday, reflecting the switchback trading on Wall Street overnight in which steep falls set off an equally strong rebound as New Year bargain hunters came out in force.</p>
<p>Europe's three key bourses, London, Frankfurt and Paris, were up some 0.5, 0.8 and 0.4 percent, respectively, by 1000 GMT after falling much more heavily on Thursday.</p>
<p>Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average began some 20 points firmer on Thursday, only to plunge 96 points into the minus column, before clawing its way back to finish the day down just 5.78 points at 6,442.49.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, before the New Year holiday, it shed 101 points.</p>
<p>U.S. analysts said the heavy early selling appeared to be an over-reaction to a report of robust manufacturing activity in December in part because so many traders and investor were still enjoying New Year vacations.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people that weren't working decided to call in late and say, &quot;Start buying these things',&quot; Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Van Kampen American Capital, said of Wall Street's performance.</p>
<p>U.S. shares are prey to fears that too rapid growth in the world's number one economy might lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine soaring share valuations.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 23 points at 4,080.4 after stumbling 61.1 points, or about 1.5 percent, on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yet with trading volumes still so low, it was too early to predict the market's direction, one London dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;There wasn't a lot of stock sold yesterday and I don't think there will be a lot bought today. The markups and markdowns are purely defensive,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said they expected the recovery to be capped at about 4,080, where the index is likely to consolidate for a while.</p>
<p>French stocks also rebounded in early trade but traders said sentiment remained fragile.</p>
<p>One trader said the market's weak rebound was disappointing and he did not expect much activity before Monday.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 8.90 points at 2,265.87, recouping only a fraction of its 2.54 percent loss on Thursday.</p>
<p>Germany's electronically traded Ibis DAX index rose sharply in pre-bourse trading, having fallen heavily in Thursday's post-bourse session. It was up 27.46 points at 2,848.27 points.</p>
<p>The DAX index of floor trading was little moved in early trade, having closed before Wall's Street's latest gyrations.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar recovered some of its composure and edged a touch higher to 1.5457 marks and 115.68 yen in early Europe after tracking asset markets lower on Thursday following the strong U.S. economic data.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's still looking OK -- we were looking for higher levels and we still stand by that but at the moment there isn't tremendous interest forex-wise,&quot; said Peter Stoneham, FX analyst at Technical Data in London.</p>
<p>Analysts said that while strong U.S. figures should pave the way for monetary tightening, currency markets have been reacting more to capital flows than potential rate rises.</p>
<p>But not all analysts believe that stronger U.S. growth will herald imminent rate rises.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction in bond markets and the initial reaction in the Dow was a panic reaction and, on reflection, people are not expecting rates to go up,&quot; said Paul Donovan, senior economist at UBS.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing slightly stronger growth than some people expected but we are not seeing massively strong growth,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Gold, sometimes seen as a hedge against inflation, fell further in early European trading, with traders puzzled by its weakness in the face of concern that inflation might re-emerge.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.5457 marks and 115.68 yen, compared with 1.5407  and 115.47 in late trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 23 points to 4,080.4.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was down 2.30 at 2,846.47. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index rose 8.90 to 2,265.87.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $364.30, compared with London's close on Thursday of $366.85. Silver eased two cents to $4.71.</p>
