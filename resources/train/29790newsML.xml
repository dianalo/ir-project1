<p>CBOT soybean futures closed mixed but mostly firm on renewed concerns about weather patterns in the U.S. Midwest, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's up on a combination of things. The word frost was a little scary and it's up on the fact we continue dry,&quot; said Mark Cermak of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>Meteorologists early Tuesday disagreed on forecasts for much cooler weather next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now there's no cool air threat to end the growing season,&quot; Cermak said.</p>
<p>Weather forecasters saw dry weather early this week. Such conditions could be hampering soybean pod filling.</p>
<p>But there were prospects for rain later this week in the eastern and southern portions of the soy belt.</p>
<p>Joel Burgio, meteorologist for Weather Services Corp said temperatures were expected to peak in the low 80s (degrees Fahrenheit) across much of the region but long-range forecasts indicated a Canadian cold front would push across the region this weekend, bringing much cooler temperatures.</p>
<p>September soybeans were hit by long liquidation, weak cash basis markets and on the early advance of soy harvest.</p>
<p>Soybeans closed 3-1/2 cents per bushel lower to 2-1/4 higher, with September down 3-1/2 at $8.11.</p>
<p>New crop November soybeans continued to flirt with the $8.00 per bushel per mark, an area of stiff technical resistance, the traders said. The session high for November was $8.03 and the low $7.95.</p>
<p>November ended near the day's low at $7.95-1/2 per bushel, up one cent from Friday's settlement.</p>
<p>Soybean futures volume was estimated at 35,000 contracts, up from 29,726 Friday.</p>
<p>In soybean options, Produce Grain bought 500 November $7.75 puts and sold 500 November $7.50 puts, the traders said. FIMAT Futures sold 400 november $8.00 puts, Continental Grain bought 300 january $8.25 calls, sold 300 January $9.25 calls and sold 300 January $7.50 puts, sources said.</p>
<p>Soybean options volume was estimated at 13,000 contracts, down from 14,665 Friday.</p>
