<title>USA: Israeli minister no match for chess super-computer.</title>
<headline>Israeli minister no match for chess super-computer.</headline>
<dateline>YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. 1997-06-02</dateline>

<p>Natan Sharansky, Israel's minister of industry and trade, on Monday played -- and lost -- against the technology behind the world's reigning chess champion, IBM's Deep Blue computer.</p>
<p>Sharansky faced off against Deep Blue Junior, a scaled-down version of the super-computer that defeated reigning world champion Garry Kasparov in May, during a ministerial visit to IBM's research headquarters 50 miles (80 km) north of New York City.</p>
<p>The Minister vs. Machine match ended after less than two hours, with Deep Blue Jr. winning the three games played.</p>
<p>Sharansky, leader of the Yisrael ba-Aliya (Israel of Immigration) party, is an avid chess player who honed his skills during nine years behind bars as a Jewish dissident in the former Soviet Union. He was involved in programming some of the first chess-playing computers 25 years ago, he said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters he was extremely impressed with the &quot;fantastic achievements&quot; of Deep Blue Jr., which can examine 20 million possible moves per second and has never been beaten by a grandmaster.</p>
<p>&quot;When playing with this computer, you learn you are powerless, you learn there is no way to provoke it,&quot; Sharansky said. &quot;It's a very interesting feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>Deep Blue Senior, an IBM RS/6000 parallel processor with specialised chess microchips that can examine hundreds of millions of possible moves per second, made history on May 11 when it defeated Kasparov in a six-game match. It became the first chess-playing machine to win a match in a traditional format, in which games can last up to seven hours.</p>
<p>Kasparov, a grandmaster known for his brilliant, quick style of play, was stunned by his defeat and has called for a rematch by year's end.</p>
<p>Sharansky said he played against Kasparov last December when the grandmaster visited Israel. As one of 25 competitors simultaneously playing against him, Sharansky won his match.</p>
