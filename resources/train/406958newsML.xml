<p>An African American grandmother arrived in Sierra Leone on Thursday on a quest for her roots, guided by a song taken to the Americas by an ancestor captured by slavers over two centuries ago.</p>
<p>Mary Moran, 75, from Harris Neck, South Corolina, traced her family's origins to the south of the former British colony in West Africa via the song -- which is in the local Mende language.</p>
<p>Hundreds of well-wishers, including government officials, turned out at Freetown's Lungi International Airport to welcome her. Officials poured libations to celebrate and consecrate her return to the mother country.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs Moran knows an ancient song in her family passed down from mother to daughter for over 200 years,&quot; said a statement issued by the Sierra Leone authorities in advance of the visit.</p>
<p>Moran, accompanied by 14 sons, daughters and grandchildren, was due to visit the village of Senehun Ngola to meet Baindu Jabati, a Sierra Leonian woman traced by researchers with the aid of the song.</p>
<p>Researchers played a recording of the song in numerous Mende villages in the south without anybody recognising it before they finally stumbled on Jabati, who learned the song from her grandmother.</p>
<p>The two women are due to sing the song together in the village on Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy said that Moran was from the Gullah community of coastal South Carolina, a distinctive group of African Americans.</p>
<p>Slavers took many ancestors of the community to the Americas from what was called the Rice Coast, the traditional rice growing region that is now Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>The Gullah community has preserved traditional foods -- rice dishes and okra soup -- which are still eaten in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone, independent since 1961 but racked by civil war since 1991, was set up under British protection in 1787 by opponents of slavery for freed slaves.</p>
<p>Moran was to meet President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who took office in March 1996 after multi-party elections ended four years of army rule. Tejan Kabbah has signed a peace deal with the rebels but implementation is proving difficult.</p>
