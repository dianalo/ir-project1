<p>Readers, fellow journalists and targets of his witty, satirical essays paid tribute on Wednesday to legendary newspaper columnist Mike Royko who died of heart failure on Tuesday at age 64.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune, where Royko toiled for 13 of his 34 years as a Chicago-based columnist syndicated to more than 600 papers, devoted Royko's usual space on the left-hand column of page three to remembrances from readers.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day, I looked forward to it, especially to laugh out loud,&quot; reader Phil Goldman wrote. &quot;He was able to say the things you thought, but could not quite articulate. He got the words out for me and I was happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through his humour and sarcasm, you could sense a quiet and abiding faith in the integrity of the working stiffs who make the city what it is,&quot; Chicagoan Jose Padilla wrote.</p>
<p>The solemn mood in the Chicago Tribune newsroom reflected the respect in which Royko was held and the vast number of friends he made within the profession where he was admired as much for his personal wit as his dogged pursuit of a story.</p>
<p>&quot;Mike wrote in a distinctive voice -- actually, in several voices,&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winning movie critic Roger Ebert wrote in Chicago's other major daily newspaper, the Sun-Times.</p>
<p>&quot;Some days he was the wise guy at the other end of the bar. Some days he was the student of clout. Some days he was (alter ego) Slats Grobnik -- who was maybe who Royko would have become if he hadn't taken that first job at City News Bureau. Some days he was a big-hearted idealist,&quot; Ebert wrote.</p>
<p>He remembered being awed when Royko offered him a ride home in a borrowed taxicab during a 1967 Chicago blizzard but then recalled the irascible columnist calling him &quot;a jerk&quot; for mistaking televised hockey highlights for the actual game.</p>
<p>Famed for exposing pompous and inept bureaucrats and elf-described journalistic pundits, and for plainly sticking the dagger in his beloved losers, baseball's Chicago Cubs, Royko could also be hilariously self-effacing.</p>
<p>The hard-drinking Royko sometimes referred to his &quot;flat-above-a-tavern youth&quot; and his Polish descent. Abhorring racism, he occasionally ran afoul of gays, Hispanics, blacks and others with his unsparing depiction of race relations.</p>
<p>Royko wrote of his love for pitching in Chicago's unique 16-inch softball leagues and started an outdoor barbecue contest and a penny-pitching tournament. He lovingly invented characters such as Slats Grobnik and expert-on-everything I.M. Kookie to make a point in his column.</p>
<p>His simple, direct style, which won him a 1972 Pulitzer Prize, reflected his raw upbringing and his love for one of his favourite novelists, fellow-Chicagoan Nelson Algren.</p>
<p>Georgie Ann Geyer, who became one of the first female foreign correspondents at the now-defunct Chicago Daily News at the time Royko was embarking on his career as a columnist, said she could not imagine Chicago and journalism without him.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only was he a terrific stylist and satirist -- and it came naturally out of his West Side of Chicago background... -- but Mike was an incredible reporter,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Writer Studs Terkel once called Royko &quot;pound for pound ... the best journalist in America,&quot; and New York columnist Jimmy Breslin referred to him as &quot;the best journalist of his time.&quot;</p>
