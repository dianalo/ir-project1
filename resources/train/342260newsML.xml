<p>-- IMPERIAL ROLLS UP RIZLA FOR 185 MILLION STG</p>
<p>Imperial Tobacco has purchased Rizla, the world's biggest maker of cigarette papers, for 185 million stg. Imperial is funding the deal from bank borrowings and is buying the business from a consortium of investors led by Union Bank of Switzerland, which took control in 1994 from the Painblanc family. Hand-rolling of cigarettes has been growing in Europe due to increases in the taxation of factory-made cigarettes.</p>
<p>-- BOVEY BACK IN BID RING FOR NOTTINGHAM FOREST</p>
<p>Grant Bovey, the video and film executive, has re-entered the bidding for Nottingham Forest football club. He claims he is seeking a recommendation for an offer which is higher than that of his rivals, and refuses to name a figure as other bidders are finalising their offers. This brings the number of bidders to three and a fourth has yet to make up its mind.</p>
<p>-- EXPORTS LIFT ROVER TO EIGHT-YEAR HIGH</p>
<p>Rover, British subsidiary to German luxury car manufacturer BMW, achieved its best production and sales performance since 1988 with the help of exports, despite losing ground in the home market. Rover is still losing money by German accounting standards, but the final total was lower than 1995's. The Land Rover range is set to be boosted by the launch of a small model at the end of the year with an executive model following in 1998, the first product of the BMW takeover.</p>
<p>THE TIMES</p>
<p>-- SECOND 110 MILLION STG WINDFALL FROM TRAIN SELL-OFF</p>
<p>Charterhouse Development Capital Group and other investors in the management buyout of the Porterbrook train-leasing company, bought by Stagecoach, are to gain a further 110 million stg &quot;windfall&quot; profit from the deal. They are selling up to 35 million shares in Stagecoach. They had accepted the shares in part-payment for their stakes in Porterbrook only six months after the Government sold the business to its management for 527 million stg.</p>
<p>-- WIDENED TRADE GAP BLAMED ON POUND</p>
<p>According to data from the Office for National Statistics, the UK trade gap widened unexpectedly in November, suggesting that the good fortune of the pound is hurting exporters. The date shows that the global trade deficit increased to 959 million stg in November compared with an upwardly revised figure of 680 million stg for the previous month. Falling import prices will help Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in his battle with the Bank of England over further rate rises, by keeping the lid on inflation.</p>
<p>-- DOUBLE PAY BONUSES FOR ENERGY GROUP EXECUTIVES</p>
<p>Executives at the Energy Group have implemented schemes to increase their salaries by up to 125 percent. Energy Group, Hanson's soon-to-be demerged energy business, has established three separate bonus programmes. Executives can receive an extra 50 percent of their salaries on an annual basis, subject to performance. Long-term bonuses will entitle them to a maximum of 75 percent. The interim scheme will boost salaries by up to 25 percent. The incentive plans are more generous than those at United Utilities.  </p>
<p>THE GUARDIAN</p>
<p>-- BT'S MERGER WITH MCI PUT ON HOLD</p>
<p>The European Union's competition authorities are to carry out an in depth investigation into British Telecom's 12 billion stg acquisition of MCI, the US phone company. The move means EU anti-trust officials have found enough problems with the deal to prevent it from being waved through after an initial one-month inquiry. The commission has a further four months to decide whether to clear the deal. Industry sources believe the deal will be given clearance as it is unusual for the commission to approve such a big merger after only a month's investigation.</p>
<p>-- TRAVEL GROUP'S SHARES FALL AFTER WARNING ON PROFITS</p>
<p>Shares in transport, travel and financial services group Hogg Robinson have plunged after a profits warning. Chairman Brian Perry said that analysts had predicted the group would produce profits of 30.4 million stg for the year to the end of March. However, the company was on course to produce figures 10 percent lower. Perry said the disappointing areas in the group were the transport side, which could be sold off, and the Scandinavian travel agency Bennett.</p>
<p>-- LADBROKE SEES OPENING IN HILTON 6.8 BLN STG ITT BID</p>
<p>UK leisure group Ladbroke have claimed that its alliance with Hilton Hotels Corp of the US was unaffected by its partner's $10.5 billion hostile takeover bid for ITT Corp, owner of the Sheraton hotels and gaming empire. Ladbroke believes the deal could present it with opportunities for taking over the management of Sheraton hotels in key cities where it does not have a presence, rebranding them as Hilton International.</p>
<p>THE INDEPENDENT</p>
<p>-- BA TALKS TO IBERIA ABOUT JOINING ALLIANCE</p>
<p>It is believed that British Airways and American Airlines are in negotiations with state-owned Spanish airline Iberia to include it in their proposed alliance. This could threaten to undermine the latest conciliatory moves over the alliance by the European Commission, which is seeking a compromise with the UK government over the number of lucrative runway slots which the two carriers would have to give up at Heathrow Airport. Iberia would be a useful ally for the alliance partners because of its strong position at Heathrow and its dominant role in the market between Europe and South America.</p>
<p>-- KENWOOD WARNING RAISES BID SPECTRE</p>
<p>Kenwood Appliances has issued another profits warning and has said Tim Beech, managing director, is to leave after little over a year in charge. Rival appliance group, Pifco, may renew its bid interest. However, directors in the group have issued no formal comment. Kenwood said that due to a poor performance in the Christmas and January sales periods profits in the second half would be lower than the 3.3 million stg achieved in the first half. Analysts have forecast full-year profits of 4.5 million stg.</p>
<p>-- PHOENIX SALE LEAVES FOUNDERS MILLIONAIRES</p>
<p>Corporate finance boutique Phoenix has been bought by US investment bank Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette for estimated 30 to 50 million stg. Phoenix has developed a niche for advising financial sector firms. Martin Smith refused to disclose the price tag but rivals suggested it could net founding partners up to seven million stg each. Smith owns around 60 percent of the group with Philip Sears, David Reid Scott and Clifford Hampton. Another ten percent is owned by its 25-strong team of corporate financiers, venture capitalists and fund managers.</p>
