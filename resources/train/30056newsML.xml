<p>Sri Lankan stocks closed steady on foreign buying of selective blue chips but many investors were sidelined on lack of sellers, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index ended 0.47 points higher at 559.70, helped by blue chips Hayleys and John Keells which rose three rupees each to 183 and 160 respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to pay up to attract sellers. But there is a limit to the premiums buyers will pay,&quot; said Manjula Kumarasinghe of Jardine Fleming.</p>
<p>The index has stayed in the 550-560 range since July, brokers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Selling has completely dried up, and even those who want to sell move away when they see a big buyer,&quot; said Prasanna Chandrasekera of John Keells.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a chicken and egg situation. You need sellers to loosen up to get the market moving, but as long as the index shows signs of firming sellers are not going to budge at current levels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blue Diamonds Jewellery Worldwide, which offered a three-for-40 bonus issue, rose 25 cents to 13.25 rupees.</p>
<p>The news the United States had launced a missile attack on Iraq had no impact on the market. -- Prithi Kodagoda 941-434319</p>
