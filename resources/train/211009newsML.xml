<p>Australian wool prices held firm at sales this week in Goulburn, Melbourne and Fremantle, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said.</p>
<p>The eastern market indicator rose one cent to 567 cents a kg clean, while the western market indicator rose seven cents to 534 cents a kg.</p>
<p>A total of 97,254 bales were offered, with a national pass-in rate of 8.7 percent, although the pass-in rate at Fremantle was 15.3 percent against an average of 6.7 percent for Goulburn and Melbourne.  </p>
<p>Given a strengthening by the Australian dollar of about two percent, prices were satisfactory, ACWE said.</p>
<p>Demand continued relatively subdued apart from China, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;China remains the backbone of the market, but is worthwhile reminding ourselves that while overall demand is consistently described as 'subdued', trade clearances at auction are up by 40 percent, or roughly 300,000 bales, on the corresponding period last season,&quot; the council said.</p>
<p>Wesfarmers Dalgety Ltd said prices held well despite another relatively large offering.  </p>
<p>Wool International said it sold a provisional 27,638 bales in the week ended Thursday to bring its stockpile to 1,191,230 bales.</p>
<p>In the futures market, a total of 100 contracts were traded in the 21 micron contract in the week ended November 21.</p>
<p>Open interest increased by four contracts to close at 849.</p>
<p>Sales next week are in Sydney, Geelong and Fremantle with a total of about 101,500 bales on offer.</p>
