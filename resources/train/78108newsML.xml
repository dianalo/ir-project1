<p>Embattled Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan moved the army into the capital Yerevan on Thursday in a crackdown on political opponents after violent clashes with riot police over Sunday's disputed election.</p>
<p>An interior ministry spokesman told Reuters six opposition members of parliament had been detained after the chamber, in which Ter-Petrosyan's ruling bloc dominate, voted to allow prosecutors to press charges against them.</p>
<p>Several were punched repeatedly by the deputies.</p>
<p>Opposition sources said opposition rival Vazgen Manukyan, sought by police under the clampdown, had gone into hiding.</p>
<p>The crisis erupted after Ter-Petrosyan, who has led the small Transcaucasian country of 3.5 million since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, claimed election victory over Manukyan, a former prime minister.</p>
<p>International observers said they saw numerous cases of fraud being committed by Ter-Petrosyan officials both in the voting and counting process.</p>
<p>&quot;Vazgen Manukyan is being sought,&quot; the spokesman said by telephone. Manukyan's whereabouts are not known and some of his associates say he is in hiding.</p>
<p>&quot;He's gone underground,&quot; said a member of his National Democratic Union who did not want to be identified.</p>
<p>The crisis burst on a country suffering great economic hardship from confrontation with neighbouring Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
<p>Conditions have eased in recent months but Armenia has suffered many winters of power cuts and shortages.</p>
<p>Unofficial results in the presidential vote gave Ter- Petrosyan 52 percent of the vote to 41 percent for Manukyan. Ter-Petrosyan needed 50 percent of the vote to avoid a second- round runoff against the former prime minister.</p>
<p>The clampdown followed violent clashes on Wednesday night between riot troops and thousands of Manukyan's supporters, who accuse the aloof 50-year old academic Ter-Petrosyan of rigging the poll.</p>
<p>Some protesters charged into parliament and beat the speaker and vice-speaker. Riot troops regained control after a nearly hour long battle with brick-hurling demonstrators.</p>
<p>An aide to Ter-Petrosyan told Reuters one soldier and one protester had been killed in the clashes and dozens were hurt.</p>
<p>Light tanks belching blue smoke sped along Yerevan streets while several thousand troops with Kalashnikov automatic rifles sealed off the centre.</p>
<p>Reuters Television producer Nino Ivanishvili witnessed a police raid on the headquarters of a small opposition party.</p>
<p>&quot;Armed people in camouflage broke into the building. They were dragging people out and punching and kicking them,&quot; she said. She saw at least seven men dragged into a police van.</p>
<p>Reporters saw soldiers dispersing small groups gathering in a square where Manukyan's supporters used to rally. At least two people were beaten and taken away.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan banned rallies and demonstrations in an early morning TV address, calling opposition politicians &quot;mentally ill&quot; people who had tried to stage a coup.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan had been widely expected to win the poll, but Manukyan fought back strongly when several opposition groups withdrew their candidates and backed him.</p>
<p>Many people in the streets of Yerevan appeared shocked by the developments and disillusioned with Ter-Petrosyan, once undisputed leader of the tiny Caucasus state.</p>
<p>In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin sent Ter-Petrosyan a congratulatory telegram and the Russian foreign ministry criticised the opposition supporters who took to the streets.</p>
