<p>The halting of international aid to Kenya because of the government's failure to fight corruption is only a temporary setback to the economy rather than a crippling blow, business analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Multilateral donors are warning President Daniel arap Moi to rein in corruption in an election year or the economy will suffer. But that does not spell doom for an economy which has made great gains because of four years of economic reforms.</p>
<p>They said the worst shock for Kenya's planners was the recent sudden loss of confidence of foreign investors which had taken the past couple of years to build.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund suspended aid on May 31. But confidence had already been bruised by political unrest as an opposition-backed alliance campaigned for political reforms to be implemented before a general election this year.</p>
<p>On Monday the World Bank backed the IMF's stand on Kenyan corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not talking of a collapse. We have a fairly good stock of foreign reserves and Kenyans are very resilient,&quot; Betty Maina, director at the private Institute of Economic Affairs, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the erosion of confidence that takes a long time to gain. That will be the problem in the near-term,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;The problems with the IMF and World Bank represent a major setback. But economic fundamentals are still in place and there is still huge potential for growth,&quot; added corporate executive Chris Kirubi, whose business interests range from real estate to manufacturing.</p>
<p>&quot;We have come from far and have made large (economic) gains. If the politicians can sort out their problems, business should thrive again,&quot; Kirubi added in Nairobi. &quot;They should act fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Maina said a stand-off over rampant corruption between Kenya and the IMF and World Bank was unlikely to be resolved until after the presidential and parliamentary elections this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The impression created by this (IMF) activity is elections are part of the contest and no one (in government) is about to blink. The stand-off could persist until after the polls,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The business community is generally very worried about the withdrawal of international support for Kenya's economy and currency,&quot; said Charles Gardner, resident representative of the Eastern Africa Association which groups British companies.</p>
<p>&quot;That means money may not be available to repair infrastructure, the power sector and roads,&quot; Gardner said.</p>
<p>&quot;We share concern with the IMF over corruption and the lack of success in bringing any culprits to justice. Graft distorts the playing field for honest business operators. Political will is desired to fight it.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors flooded into this East African country from 1993 as the government began to liberalise in earnest and interest rates as high as 84 percent produced unusually high returns.</p>
<p>Before 1993 trade and currency were strictly controlled and foreign investors could not freely repatriate their money.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mudavadi, in response to pressure from the IMF which suspended aid in 1991 to press for economic and political reforms, began implementing economic reforms in April 1993 and foreign cash began increasingly flowing to Nairobi.</p>
<p>Kenya liberalised foreign exchange and marketing rules, freed interest rates, streamlined the civil service and started a privatisation process -- all of which made Kenya attractive.</p>
<p>Kenya was rewarded with GDP growth of 4.8 percent in 1995, 4.6 percent in 1996 and a forecast growth of 4.0 percent this year compared to near-zero levels in 1990, 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>Before the IMF halted its key aid package on July 31, benchmark interest rates on 91-day treasury bills averaged 18.199 percent and inflation was down to single digits.</p>
<p>The shilling, which was stuck within the 50-60 range to the dollar in the last two years, has fallen by 18.45 percent since the IMF decision to stand at a new official low of 70.48 against the dollar on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Exporters at first welcomed the shilling's decline, saying the currency had been overvalued and the correction would help exports and tourism. But they said the advantages were more than cancelled when political instability was taken into account.</p>
<p>Kenya's foreign currency reserves stood at $1.55 billion in May and the central bank held 68 percent. The central bank has spent $83 million in intervention to shore up the shilling since July. ($1=70.48 Kenyan shillings)</p>
