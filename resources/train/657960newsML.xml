<p>JULY     Close  * Support * Resist * RSI14 *   MA10 *   MA30</p>
<p>COFFEE    1,710 *  1,600  *  1,820 *  39.5 *  2,057 *  1,945</p>
<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - June 12----------------</p>
<p>LIFFE coffee futures were expected to drop further, with July seen testing support at $1,600.</p>
<p>Mathematically, July was called to open down $100, but traders said an opening of $40 to $50 lower was more realistic.</p>
<p>July robustas closed at $1,710 per tonne and CSCE July ended down 10.30 cents at a six-week low of 207.65 cents per pound.</p>
<p>In London on Wednesday, &quot;the market gapped lower into a very large band of support, established between January and May, centered on $1,600,&quot; said Trevor Neil, senior technical analyst at Union Cal Futures. &quot;I think that will prove to be an exhaustion gap for a move lower.&quot;  </p>
<p>If July robustas fail to hold $1,600, Neil said he could see a drop to the next key support at $1,484.</p>
<p>&quot;If it breaks $1,484 then, all is lost to $1,200,&quot; he said. &quot;We would then, go back to where we started in November.&quot;</p>
<p>But Neil did not think coffee's overall bull run was completed. He expected at least one more rally in coffee to test the highs. But how coffee acts in that rally would be key to whether the commodity will make new highs.</p>
<p>Initial July resistance was at $1,820, the top of the chart gap made on Wednesday when July gapped lower. The gap extends from the June 10 low of $1,820 and Wednesday's high of $1,740.</p>
<p>Neil saw coffee eventually rising again to fill that gap but said that rally could start petering out near $2,040.</p>
