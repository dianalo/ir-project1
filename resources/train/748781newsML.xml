<p>Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian autocrat widely blamed abroad for starting the Balkan wars of the early 1990s, became president of federal Yugoslavia on Wednesday to extend his grip on power for at least four more years.</p>
<p>He has been the dominant figure in Yugoslav politics since the breakup of the old six-member Balkan federation in 1991-92 which plunged departing republics Bosnia and Croatia into war.</p>
<p>But Milosevic, 55, was prevented by Serbia's constitution from serving a third term as republican president.</p>
<p>So he engineered a takeover of the Yugoslav presidency, hitherto a relatively ceremonial post, in a manoeuvre to remain the political supremo in Belgrade and power broker in the crisis-ridden region of old Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>He is virtually assured of retaining authoritarian power through his control over the bureaucracy, the mainstream media and a vast security police force.</p>
<p>Milosevic is held responsible by many in the West for precipitating the bloody breakup of old multinational Yugoslavia by trying to concentrate power in Belgrade after riding a revival of Serbian nationalism to the presidency of Serbia in 1987.</p>
<p>In taking the helm of Yugoslavia on Wednesday, he swore to fight to &quot;achieve human and citizens' rights and freedoms and safeguarding peace and prosperity of all citizens of Yugoslavia&quot;.</p>
<p>Outside the presidency building, hundreds of pro-democracy protesters shouting anti-Milosevic slogans scuffled with the police and pelted his car with old shoes, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Milosevic survived a serious challenge to his authority last winter when an opposition coalition staged mass protest rallies every day for three months, rallying up to 500,000 people at the peak of a campaign against regional election fraud.</p>
<p>But the opposition failed to cash in on its popularity and the coalition collapsed amid bickering over power-sharing.</p>
<p>Milosevic reasserted his dominance but resentment among the population, a third of which lives in poverty, still runs high.</p>
<p>The post of Serbian president vacated by Milosevic will be administered by the speaker of the Serbian parliament, Dragan Tomic, until presidential elections scheduled for September 21.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav office will preserve Milosevic's pivotal role in the 1995 Dayton peace treaty, now faltering in Bosnia as Serb leaders -- once clients of Milosevic -- resist any handover of indicted war criminals who still pull strings behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic has been locked in a power struggle with allies of indicted former leader Radovan Karadzic since she publicly accused them of plundering the territory through vast smuggling rackets.</p>
<p>Diplomats believe Milosevic will soon cut off support for Bosnian Serb ultra-nationalists to wash his hands of the unpopular issue of handing over war-crimes indictees in Bosnia as the United States and major allies demand under terms of the Dayton accords.</p>
<p>Washington has maintained diplomatic and financial sanctions against Serbian-led Yugoslavia to bar it from foreign funds desperately needed to restart its moribund economy.</p>
<p>Another U.S. condition for dismantling the embargo is a settlement guaranteeing minority rights for the majority Albanian community in Serbia's troubled southern province of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Many Albanians are demanding outright independence while the Serbian government refuses concessions, contending that Kosovo is the historical cradle of Serb culture.</p>
<p>By assuming the federal office Milosevic, the master of brinksmanship, has passed the buck on Kosovo to his successor in the Serbian presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter what the new Serbian president decides on Kosovo, someone will find it inacceptable and cry foul. The blame will be his (Serbian president) but there would be no doubt it was Milosevic pulling the strings,&quot; a diplomat said.</p>
<p>Milosevic also leaves behind the tough issue of imminent economic reforms in Serbia which experts believe will cause social upheaval as unavoidable layoffs hit home.</p>
<p>Milosevic was elected by the federal parliament on July 15 after Montenegro, junior partner in the reduced, two-member Yugoslav federation, thwarted his plans for a popular ballot which would have helped him avoid parliamentary restraint.</p>
<p>The rift with Montenegrin reformists, who insist Milosevic must comply to U.S. demands for democracy and reintegrate Yugoslavia into the outside world, remains to be patched up.</p>
<p>But analysts believe the two sides will reach accommodation palatable to Milosevic's power interests for the time being.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Milosevic has been saying words that his people, living on an average monthly income of $140, want to hear:</p>
<p>&quot;We are launching a project of material and spiritual renewal and recovery of society as a whole, the economy, technology, the state, education, media, villages and towns, roads and bridges, hospitals and schools,&quot; he said in a speech.</p>
