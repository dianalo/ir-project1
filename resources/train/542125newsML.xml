<p>More Chinese are finding jobs in the civil service and private enterprise, but the number of workers in foreign firms and lumbering state companies has shown a decline, state media said on Sunday.</p>
<p>At the end of the first quarter, a total of 698.85 million Chinese were actively employed, up by 8.55 million compared with a year ago, the China Information newspaper said quoting figures from the State Statistical Bureau.</p>
<p>The number of industrial workers continued to decline, with 147.04 million workers employed in urban and village enterprises at the end of March, down by 391,000 compared with a year ago and down by 1.4 million compared with the end of 1996, it said.</p>
<p>This was the first time for many years that the number of industrial workers had shown a decline both year-on-year and compared with the end of the previous year, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Of the total, the number employed by the state sector was 108.69 million, down by 15,000 compared with a year ago and down by 804,000 compared with the end of December, 1996, it said.</p>
<p>Town and village collective enterprises employed 29 million people at the end of March, down by 1.24 million compared with a year ago and falling by 538,000 from the end of 1996, it said.</p>
<p>Foreign-invested and joint venture enterprises employed 9.25 million people at the end of the first quarter, rising by 865,000 compared with a year-ago but down 63,000 from the end of December, 1996, it said.</p>
<p>This was the first decline in the numbers employed by foreign-funded firms in more than a decade, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The largest number of workers were lost from the manufacturing sector, it said, falling by 950,000 compared with the end of the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>However, the number of those employed by the public service sector and government units continued to swell, it said.</p>
<p>State business units and enterprises employed 73.36 million people at end-March, falling by 1.28 million from a year ago, it said.</p>
<p>However, the public services employed 25.02 million, up by 1.02 million from a year ago and government units employed 103 million people, up by 2.53 million, it said.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of a swelling number of workers in the public service sector and in government units at a time when workers in state enterpises were declining had drawn government concern, it said. It gave no details of what the government would do.</p>
<p>Private enterprise continued to grow, employing 24.1 million people at the end of March, up by 800,000 compared with the same period in 1996, it said. Many of these new workers were factory workers laid off by state enterprises who had set up their own small businesses, it said.</p>
<p>The problem of finding jobs for workers laid off or not receiving a salary from state enterprises was becoming more serious, with a total of 9.0 million now laid off, accounting for about 6.0 percent of the total workforce, it said.</p>
<p>China's urban unemployment rate stood at 3.0 percent at the end of March, representing a total of 5.3 million urban workers without jobs, the State Statistical Bureau has said.</p>
<p>Beijing has said it expects unemployment to rise in 1996 and has forecast the rate at between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent in 1997.</p>
