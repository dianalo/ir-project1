<text>
<p>Former finance minister Kenneth Clarke staked his claim for the leadership of Britain's Conservatives on Wednesday with a speech in which he accused his successor Gordon Brown of &quot;economic cheating of the worst kind&quot;.</p>
<p>Clarke claimed Brown was preparing tax rises which he had consistently foresworn during last month's election campaign, and was now seeking a bogus justification for them.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour is preparing to cook the books which we left in apple-pie order,&quot; Clarke told a meeting of Conservative lawyers in London in his first big campaign speech.</p>
<p>Labour swept to power in the May 1 election with a 179-seat majority. John Major immediately said he would give up the Conservative leadership, firing the starting gun for a six-candidate contest to replace him.</p>
<p>Clarke is the main hope of the party's centre-left, and is widely expected to come out on top of the bunch in the first round of voting among the 164 Conservative MPs on June 10.</p>
<p>But the absolute majority required under the rules looks beyond him and his opponents are expected to rally round a right-wing candidate, perhaps the youthful William Hague, in the second round expected a week later.</p>
<p>Clarke argued that the economy must become the key battleground between Labour and the Conservatives.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we are in opposition, we must make Labour's almost certain inability to sustain our economic legacy the absolute centre point of the Tory attack,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown has asked the National Audit Office, an official watchdog, to review economic forecasts made by the then Conservative government in November's budget.</p>
<p>&quot;He wants to argue they are too optimistic. His motive is to try to justify tax increases now, to cover the additional Labour spending he was planning anyway,&quot; Clarke said.</p>
<p>&quot;Any idea that, given the right policies, we could not sustain a growth rate averaging 2.5 percent for the rest of this decade is absurd,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Brown wants to revise down that prediction simply to justify a tax increase much bigger than he led the people to expect.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke said if growth did fall, it would be because Labour increased taxes, made interest rate rises more likely by allowing the Bank of England to set rates and introduced a national minimum wage.</p>
<p>Bookmakers Ladbrokes on Wednesday made 36-year-old ex-Welsh Secretary Hague 4/5 favourite to replace Major, but reported a flood of bets on Clarke, narrowing his odds to 6/4 from 5/2. Only a few weeks ago he was a rank outsider at 7/1.</p>
