<p>Bando McGlocklin Capital Corp said Thursday its board had approved a spinoff to shareholders of its banking holding company InvestorsBancorp.</p>
<p>Bando McGlocklin said it will spin off both InvestorsBancorp and its proposed InvestorsBank subsidiary. The decision was based on a number of factors, including the desire to maintain Bando McGlocklin's favorable tax status as a real estate investment trust, the company added.  </p>
<p>Under the new plan, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bando McGlocklin shareholders would receive shares in InvestorsBancorp on a pro rata basis. InvestorsBancorp would own all of the shares of InvestorsBank.</p>
<p>The company said that, before the distribution, InvestorsBank is expected to be capitalized with $4,500,000 from Bando McGlocklin, in exchange for 90 percent of the capital stock, and $500,000 from Chairman Goerge Schonath in exchange for 10 percent of the capital stock.</p>
<p>The distribution of shares, which must be approved by the SEC, is expected to take place on or about June 30, 1997. Shareholder approval is not required for the distribution, it added.</p>
<p>Bando McGlocklin said it needs Federal Reserve Board approval of its application to form a bank holding company and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) approval to form a state bank. These approvals are expected before June 30, Schonath said.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions has approved the formation of InvestorsBank, it added.</p>
