<headline>Dlr begins lower in U.S., retail sales data weigh.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-13</dateline>

<p>The dollar began U.S. trade at weaker levels, briefly dipping after a soft U.S. retail sales report cast doubt on prospects for another rate hike from the Federal Reserve next week, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers were tame for the most part,&quot; said John Hazelton, chief dealer at Manufacturers and Traders Bank. &quot;They're certainly not supportive of the notion that Greenspan is in a tightening mode.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that retail sales fell 0.3 percent in April, exactly in line with consensus forecasts.  </p>
<p>Excluding automobiles, however, April sales retreated by a weaker-than-expected 0.1 percent. Headline and ex-autos numbers for March were also revised lower.</p>
<p>The dollar opened at 1.6985/95 marks, down from 1.7070/80 at Monday's close. It was changing hands at 119.10/20 yen at the outset of trading against 119.30/40 on Monday.</p>
<p>The sales report pushed dollar/yen briefly below 119 and dollar/mark near its lows for the day before the greenback staged a mild bounceback.</p>
<p>In Asian trade, damage-control by Japanese officials had led to a stabilization in the dollar at slightly lower levels.  </p>
<p>Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that foreign exchange rates were likely to settle at an appropriate level soon, while Bank of Japan executive director Yutaka Yamaguchi said it was important for the currency market to stabilize and reflect fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar fell overnight on the back of reports of U.S. and European based funds selling dollars, but important support levels held,&quot; said Marc Chandler, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the Japanese were just as surprised by the pace and the magnitude of the dollar's decline (last week) as the market was ... and it's probably not something they look forward to see continuing,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, dealers said they expected yen buying to continue, particularly versus the mark and other European currencies.</p>
<p>After falling to a near-one year trough against the yen on Monday, the mark was making headway against the Japanese currency in early U.S. dealings, rising well above the 70 threshold.  </p>
<p>&quot;I expect the mark/yen play to continue,&quot; said a senior dealer at a European bank in New York. &quot;The yen has finally caught a bid and people who were making a fair amount of money since the beginning of the year by playing the yen against crosses in a carry trade are cashing it in.&quot;</p>
<p>Much depends upon near-term economic data from Japan, traders said. On Tuesday, news of a 12.7 percent drop in Japanese machinery orders in March led players to question whether a near-term Japanese rate hike is indeed in the cards.  </p>
<p>A statement from Japan's Economic Planning Agency calling for a 4.5 percent rise in machine orders for the current quarter as a whole tempered this pessimism, however.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected dollar/yen to settle into a new lower range between 115 and 120 yen for the time being -- levels which both Japanese industry and government officials appear to welcome.</p>
<p>In other trade on Tuesday, the dollar slipped to 1.4340/50 Swiss francs from 1.4378/88 by the outset of trade. The greenback was also lower at Canadian $1.3863/68 versus C$1.3892/97.</p>
<p>The British pound held steady above 2.76 marks and edged up to $1.6237/47 at the open from $1.6230/40 on Monday.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar opened at $0.7786/91, little changed from Monday's closing rate of $0.7785/90.</p>
