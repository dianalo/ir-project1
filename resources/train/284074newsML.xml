<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish bonds slide lower after U.S. NAPM data.</title>
<headline>Irish bonds slide lower after U.S. NAPM data.</headline>
<dateline>DUBLIN 1997-01-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Irish government bonds slid lower in thin afternoon trade on Thursday mostly owing to a lack of drive in European markets and the release of better-than-expected U.S. December NAPM data, dealers said.</p>
<p>U.S. December NAPM rose to 54.0, which was well above forecasts of 52.3.</p>
<p>&quot;European bond markets in general are weaker. It confirms what I've been saying over the last number of weeks, that European markets were artificially inflated while the U.S. data just confirmed things were over there,&quot; the dealer added.  </p>
<p>&quot;We can now expect a move of quarter-of-a-percent in U.S. interest rates while we will see the UK raise its interest rates over the next four weeks too.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Irish credit figures released late in the day were disastrous, the weakness of the market here was superceded by international factors...not least by what is happening in the U.S.,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>The adjusted annual rate of Irish private sector credit rose to 16.4 percent in November from a revised 14.4 percent in October, central bank monthly statistics showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>By 1610 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 had fallen 70 pence from Wednesday's close to 100.95 to yield 6.26 percent while the eight percent bond due 2006 had slipped 113 pence from the close at 107.95 to yield 6.72 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said the U.S. was likely to remain the main focus of attention but they added that key domestic data due out on Friday would be crucial for the Irish market.</p>
<p>Ireland's 1996 Exchequer Borrowing Requirement (EBR), due at 1630 GMT on Friday, is expected to be well below target at 250 to 400 million punts, helped by strong growth in tax revenues, economists said.</p>
