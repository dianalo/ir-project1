<headline>BT shares gain amid positive analyst comment.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in British Telecommunications Plc rose on Thursday as analysts at brokerages including SBC Warburg and Lehman Brothers repeated &quot;buy&quot; recommendations on the stock.</p>
<p>BT shares were up 3-1/2p at 390 by 1220 GMT in active trading of 5.4 million shares. Earlier the shares reached a day's high of 391p, near the 15-month high of 407-1/2p set December 9.  </p>
<p>Warburg analysts expect BT to generate &quot;more than double-digit&quot; earnings growth in the medium term through its international operations, while its domestic business could also see faster volume growth combined with slower price reductions.</p>
<p>They said the improving outlook could lead them to increase their earnings estimates, and that the stock's valuation of 10.3 times the company's pre-exceptional earnings and 6.4 percent yield did not reflect its strong outlook.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile at Lehman analyst Paul Norris forecast earnings growth of eight percent for the combined Concert group and said the stock should trade at a ten percent premium to the UK market, giving a price target of 490p.</p>
<p>Norris pointed out that BT shares were trading at the same levels as in the autumn of 1992 while its planned merger partner MCI only recently regained levels attained in the summer of 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe both companies are now poised to emerge from the competitive, regulatory and dilutive problems that characterised these recent years,&quot; said Norris in a research note.</p>
