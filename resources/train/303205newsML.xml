<title>FRANCE: Corsican separatists bomb empty holiday villas.</title>

<p>A new group of Corsican separatist guerrillas bombed and destroyed four empty villas on a holiday estate on the French Mediterranean island overnight, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>About 20 hooded gunmen raided the estate after seizing the gatekeeper. Police said they defused one bomb after the attack.</p>
<p>There were no casualties in the attack which was claimed by the Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC), a new group using the name of the island's first separatist movement. The original group has split into the FLNC-Historic wing and FLNC-Traditional wing.</p>
<p>It was the first attack by the &quot;new&quot; FLNC which surfaced last May when its hooded leaders held a clandestine news conference near Ajaccio and announced they would use violence if the interests of the Corsican people were being threatened.</p>
<p>A communique claiming responsibility for the bombings said the villas were targetted to highlight the separatists' rejection of holiday villages which they say are set up with &quot;laundered&quot; Mafia money from France and Italy.</p>
<p>The bombers accused businesses of paying off separatist movements like the FLNC-Historic Wing to avoid being the target of bomb attacks, thus encouraging racketeering.</p>
<p>The appearance of the new FLNC, and its criticism of the FLNC-Historic wing added to the complexity of the Corsican scene where rival separatist groups are fighting each other as well as the French authorities.</p>
<p>The French government has cracked down on A Cuncolta Naziunalista, the political arm of the FLNC-Historic wing which staged several bombings on the French mainland recently, including one on Prime Minister Alain Juppe's mayoral office in Bordeaux.</p>
<p>Three leaders of that group have been detained in the past week and remanded in custody in Paris for suspected membership of a terrorist group and offences against weapons laws.</p>
<p>The new FLNC was believed to be made up of dissidents from yet another group, the Movement for Self-Determination (MPA) whose main demand is that France recognises the existence of a separate Corsican people without necessarily granting the island independence.</p>
<p>The MPA also wants the Corsican language to be made a compulsory subject in the island's schools. Most residents of Corsica no longer speak Corsican. Many mainland families have settled on the island to take advantage of its balmy weather and easy lifestyle.</p>
