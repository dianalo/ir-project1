<p>Rwanda has rejected reports by the United Nations and Amnesty International that Rwandan soldiers have killed more than 2,000 civilians in the last three months.</p>
<p>A government spokesman said those killed in recent clashes with the army were not &quot;innocent civilians&quot; but militiamen, the Rwandan news agency RNA reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Amnesty said last week that the Rwandan army had massacred civilians in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi Prefectures, where most of the population is Hutu.</p>
<p>RNA quoted Claude Dusaidi, adviser to Rwanda vice-president and defence minister Major-General Paul Kagame, as saying the U.N. and the London-based Amnesty reports were &quot;baseless&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures advanced by Amnesty International are mere fabrication,&quot; Dusaidi said. &quot;Since when have armed militiamen become innocent civilians?&quot;</p>
<p>Hutus, who make up the majority of Rwanda's population, dominated the government there after overthrowing the last Tutsi monarch in 1959. But the Hutu government was overthrown in 1994 after Rwandan exiles, mostly Tutsis, invaded from neighbouring Uganda.</p>
<p>Dusaidi said the Rwandan army had been fighting former Rwandan soldiers who fled into the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire) after committing genocide in Rwanda in 1994.</p>
<p>These ex-soldiers, known as Interahamwe, had recently been launching attacks in large numbers from Congo into Rwanda.</p>
