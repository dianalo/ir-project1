<p>White House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed on Tuesday said he was encouraged by indications that the Republicans may be showing signs of flexibility on the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We are always encouraged to see any sign of flexibility and compromise,&quot; he told a briefing for a small group of reporters when asked about a statement by House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich endorsing putting off a drive for a major tax cut.  </p>
<p>Reed said that he believed the new veto power would serve as a major deterrent to &quot;pork barrel&quot; legislation, since few lawmakers would like to see their project vetoed on the basis of being wasteful.</p>
<p>&quot;I can assure you we will relish the first time,&quot; Reed told reporters, adding &quot;Congress will be much less likely to include projects that are difficult to defend.&quot;</p>
<p>He said, however, that the veto power would largely be tied to appropriations bills and would &quot;not affect the dynamic of these budget discussion we are having now.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added that budgets are going to be tight for the forseeable future, so the &quot;prospects of loading the budget with pork were not very good anyway.&quot;</p>
