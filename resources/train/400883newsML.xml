<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks soar to new record on rates hope.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks soar to new record on rates hope.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-02-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks soared to notch up their third record close in as many sessions on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said forecast falls in primary rates, expected favorable 1996 earnings reports and steady gains on Wall Street coaxed buyers into the market.</p>
<p>Final closing figures showed the leading IPC share index had ended up 48.92 points, or 1.26 percent, at a record of 3,938.69.</p>
<p>Trading volume was brisk at 103.8 million shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market well withstood intraday profit-taking, foreigners are still stepping in and we expect (primary) rates to fall,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of eight money market traders in Mexico City showed they expected the Banco de Mexico, the country's central bank, to assign bellwether 28-day Cetes at 18.86 percent at its weekly auction of government securities.</p>
<p>This would be a fall of 60 basis points since last week's auction and a rate unseen since an abrupt devaluation of the peso sent Mexican financial markets into a tailspin in December 1994.  </p>
<p>Both Kof and Ahmsa ended among the leading percentage gainers.</p>
<p>&quot;Kof began the charge today, which posted an excellect report. Other stocks like GCC and Autrey also look like coming good,&quot; said Jaime Hernandez, an equity analyst at the Interacciones brokerage.    Analysts also said</p>
<p>that gains on Wall Street propped up the bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow Jones helped us, albeit relatively, as lack of volatility on Wall Street is a benfit,&quot; said Rodolfo Campuzano, an analyst at the Invex brokerage.  </p>
<p>Fernandez noted that the bourse now had limited scope for further gains in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically, the bourse is showing signs of fatigue and overbuying. The market now offers the possibility to divest and take good profits, considering March and April are historically slow months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our June target for the IPC is still 4,100 points,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 122 stocks changed hands, with gainers heavily outnumbering decliners, by 70 to 28.  </p>
<p>Traders said soft drinks bottlers Ggemex CPO shares were notable gainers, up 94 centavos to 13.70 pesos on favorable earnings by Kof.</p>
<p>Kof's holding company Femsa B shares also gained strongly, ending up 1.90 pesos at 32.95 pesos.</p>
<p>Traders said the bottlers may also have gained on speculation that soft drinks prices were about to rise.</p>
<p>Financially-troubled autoparts maket Iasasa headed the decliners' list, off three centavos to 50 centavos, followed by retail stock, which fell 38 centavos at 6.52 pesos.</p>
