<p>Analysts said on Wednesday that the music industry could be set for a protracted period of stagnation, which could mean music and movies group PolyGram needs to restructure further to improve earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;PolyGram needs to reduce costs further to show a reasonable growth of say six or seven percent in earnings,&quot; said analyst Rene Verhoef of NibStrating after PolyGram issued a profit warning for 1996.</p>
<p>PolyGram's 1995 net profit grew only marginally to 741 million guilders ($433.3 million) from 738 million as a result of slack pop music sales in the important second half of the year.</p>
<p>And on Wednesday PolyGram -- 75 percent owned by Philips Electronics NV -- warned that full-year 1996 operating results would be flat or slightly down on 1995, adding that it would take a one-time restructuring charge of $90 million.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not see the the stagnation as temporary, as PolyGram would have us believe,&quot; said Verhoef. The high growth rates of the past were over as consumers had finished replacing their LPs with CDs, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Margins in the industry are also under pressure as department stores want to purchase music more cheaply,&quot; he said, adding that the malaise could continue for several more years.</p>
<p>&quot;The crucial thing is, will the market pick up?&quot; said Joost van Beek of Van Meer James Capel, who said he was less pessimistic for the slightly longer term.</p>
<p>Van Beek foresaw PolyGram's earnings per share dropping to around 4.00 guilders in 1996 from 4.12 guilders in 1995. &quot;But, in 1997 the figure could rise to 4.50 again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1996 PolyGram's net profit grew one percent to 272 million guilders, a slightly better result than most analysts' low-pitched expectations.</p>
<p>But PolyGram shares fell over seven percent to 78.60 guilders following the company's profit warning today.</p>
<p>Van Beek said PolyGram's movie business, still in the red at the moment, could break even at the operating level in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The movie business is showing a strong increase (in volume),&quot; said Verhoef, adding this sector counted for just about 10 percent of PolyGram's turnover at the moment but could eventually increase to about 25 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Van Beek said he saw no reason to change his forecast for tomorrow's third quarter earnings from Philips.</p>
<p>&quot;My Philips forecast was already low,&quot; he said, adding he expected a 230 million guilder profit from normal operations, excluding extraordinary charges likely to be taken by Philips.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Philips' third-quarter net profit from ordinary operations to drop to 240-360 million guilders, far below the equivalent 1995 figure of 539 million guilders.</p>
