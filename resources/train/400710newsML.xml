<p>Ukraine's hryvnia currency fell to 1.8150 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday from near-record highs last week of 1.765, as Ukrainian banks held on to dollars, seeking higher levels at which to sell, a central bank official said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's part of the game, and the drop will not continue,&quot; said Mykola Melnychuk, chief of hard currency reserves. &quot;I wouldn't say the banks have a lot of hryvnia at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>The hryvnia began its drop on Monday, hitting 1.791 to the dollar from 1.765 at the end of last week.</p>
<p>Its initial climb to the highs was attributed by economists to increased buying on the Treasury bill market and an influx of foreign donor money into Ukraine.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very sensitive right now. If an investor comes in and spends $10 or $20 million, then we'll see the trend reverse itself,&quot; Melnychuk said.</p>
<p>He said the change was not worrying the bank, which liked to see the hryvnia trading between 1.76 and 1.90 to the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;This really is not a big difference,&quot; he said. &quot;I remember earlier when the currency changed by 20 percent, not one percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The hryvnia was introduced to replace the interim karbovanets currency, which started at about 40 &quot;coupons&quot; to the dollar after independence in 1991 and reached 200,000 to the dollar when it was withdrawn last September.</p>
