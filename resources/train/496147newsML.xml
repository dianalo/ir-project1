<title>UK: LIFFE cocoa ends down as late fund sales emerge.</title>
<headline>LIFFE cocoa ends down as late fund sales emerge.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE cocoa futures closed lower after fund sales emerged in late Wednesday trading.</p>
<p>May ended down two stg at 970 stg per tonne and July down seven at 980.</p>
<p>Scale-down trade buying, particularly in back months like December, kept prices buoyed most of the day, traders said.</p>
<p>They also noted some early short-covering in May and switches in May/July. They said switch buying came near 17 and selling near 15 in the morning.</p>
<p>But when New York failed to hold slim gains at its open, funds started to sell again, they said. Just after London's close, CSCE May cocoa was down $15 at $1,385 per tonne and July down $18 to $1,422.</p>
<p>With London's weak close, traders were mixed on the outlook.</p>
<p>Some traders saw a positive fundamental picture, with solid underlying demand and expectations for Ivorian mid-crop beans to be small and low quality.</p>
<p>Technically, they said July's falling to finally fill a gap between 985 and 982 completed cocoa's downside objective and now made room for that contract to rally further.</p>
<p>&quot;It's healthier to fill the gap for a longer-term upmove,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders also noted that cocoa was becoming oversold and 985 in July was about a 50-percent retracement from July's highs, which should combine to attract some technical buying.</p>
<p>However, others were not so optimistic. They did not see much change in the fundamentals and said technicals pointed to at least one more round of weakness before a rebound could occur.</p>
<p>Broker GNI said in a daily report that &quot;from a technical perspective, it (Tuesday) was far from a positive day.&quot;</p>
<p>It predicted CSCE cocoa would lose another $15 to $25 and London about 10 to 15 stg before mustering strength to rebound.</p>
<p>Pressure from liquidation or rollover of speculative May positions before first notice day on April 17 in New York should continue. As of Monday's close, May held more than 21,000 open contracts.</p>
<p>LIFFE July cocoa support rests between 940 and 950.</p>
<p>But once pressure related to first notice day is alleviated, some said cocoa could rally again and May could reach 1,000 to 1,020 in the medium-term.</p>
