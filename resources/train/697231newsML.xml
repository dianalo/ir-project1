<p>Germany maintained on Monday its hardline resistance to a 60-billion-Ecu ($67 million) guarantee fund for the European Union's audiovisual industry, meaning the plan will have to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Under pressure from its partners to back the fund, which the sector says it needs to match up to Hollywood competition and fulfil its job-creating potential, Bonn told a meeting of EU culture ministers the benefits had been overestimated.</p>
<p>&quot;We refuse the idea of this fund,&quot; German Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Helmut Schaefer was quoted by diplomats as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;We should not create illusions that this would change something for the industry,&quot; he said. Bonn says the film sector should be funded at a national rather than European level.</p>
<p>The film sector has been begging for the five-year fund, saying it could generate investments of 300 million Ecus.</p>
<p>It says the fund would be a counterpart to a decision by EU culture ministers not to impose tougher quotas on imports of Hollywood films and television programmes when EU broadcasting legislation was reviewed recently.</p>
<p>Although Germany is not the only country to have doubts about the fund, the others either maintained a wait-and-see silence, as in the case of Britain whose new government is reviewing its film policy, or indicated that they were swinging in favour, as with Sweden.</p>
<p>New French Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann told ministers she was &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; that the outgoing Dutch EU presidency had not done more to push the plan. &quot;She was quite miffed,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>Spain, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Denmark, Portugal and Luxembourg also lined up in favour, but Dutch Culture Minister Aad Nuis said that with the plan needing unanimity, it would now have to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still in the position that we cannot start anything European unless you have unanimity. That's the problem,&quot; he told a news conference. &quot;I'm not absolutely pessimistic but we do have to find a new way.&quot;</p>
<p>The EU's Culture Commissioner Marcelino Oreja said he would push on with the plan.</p>
<p>The ministers were meeting against a backdrop of mounting frustration at Germany's inability on constitutional grounds to endorse EU cultural policy decisions.</p>
<p>Fearing a legal challenge by its states, who have authority over cultural policy, Germany blocked a move to bring in qualified majority voting on cultural matters in the closing stages of the June 16-17 EU summit in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Germany recently infuriated the European Parliament by single-handedly blocking a compromise on a fund, dubbed Raphael, to help preserve the EU's cultural heritage, from museums to libraries and archeological sites.</p>
<p>It signalled to its partners on Monday that it would stick to its position when talks with the parliament on the programme resume on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Given that progress on EU cultural policy has been &quot;meagre&quot;, in the words of several ministers, EU member states endorsed an idea by Italian Culture Minister Walter Veltroni to study setting up a new culture fund and programme to act as an umbrella for the EU's cultural efforts.</p>
<p>Several EU countries, including Germany and Sweden, said that this would not mean spending more money on cultural policy.</p>
