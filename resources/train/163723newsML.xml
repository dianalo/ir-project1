<p>Israel said on Monday it had no intention of attacking Syria and wanted to restart peace talks with its arch-enemy.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has no aggressive intentions towards Syria. Israel's face is towards peace and the government of Israel is working to achieve this peace,&quot; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said in response to comments by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad that an Israeli attack was a &quot;possibility&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has said time and again, through the various channels and also in public that it has no intention of attacking Syria,&quot; Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>&quot;On the contrary it is interested in reducing the level of tension and creating an atmosphere conducive to renewing peace talks,&quot; Levy said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office said Israel had sent &quot;calming messages&quot; to Syria through the United States, Russia and France. It did not say when the messages were sent but senior envoys from all three countries have been to Israel over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office quoted the prime minister as saying tensions had since been reduced.</p>
<p>Asked at a joint news conference in Damascus with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak whether he ruled out an Israeli attack against Syria or south Lebanon, Assad said on Monday: &quot;This should not happen, but nobody could say that it will not happen. It is a possibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked by the radio why Assad warned of confrontation while the two countries were exploring back-channel initiatives, Levy said: &quot;I am not responsible for every declaration and announcement of President Assad. I am responsible for what I and the Israeli government say.&quot;</p>
<p>Tensions between Israel and Syria have been running high since Netanyahu took office in June.</p>
<p>Syrian troop movements in Lebanon last month and a series of military exercises have given Israel war jitters. Damascus has said the redeployment was defensive.</p>
<p>More than five years of painstakingly slow peace talks between the two countries have stalled over the Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Damascus demands a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu has vowed never to give up the strategic plateau.</p>
<p>The peace talks have been suspended for eight months since a wave of suicide attacks by Islamic militants killed 59 in the Jewish state.</p>
