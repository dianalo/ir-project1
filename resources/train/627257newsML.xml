<title>FRANCE: French stocks end touch firmer in record volume.</title>
<headline>French stocks end touch firmer in record volume.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>French shares closed the last trading day before Sunday's runoff parliamentary election vote with a slight gain, in exceptionally heavy volume.</p>
<p>Traders said the market had firmed after the CAC index hit 2,525, a level needed to settle May futures and options contracts expiring today.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 4.70 points or 0.18 percent at 2,583.94. The CAC-40 futures contract was down 33.5 at 2,541.5 from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was 18.16 billion francs. The SBF said it was the highest since the 13.01 billion francs traded on March 6, 1997.  </p>
<p>The CAC has lost 6.48 percent on the week, dragged down by pessimism over Sunday's ballot and prospects of a Socialist win.</p>
<p>The market has lost its gains since the April 21 announcement of the snap election and retraced from the high of 2,804.51 hit last Friday before the upset vote for the left smashed the markt's complacency for a conservative win.</p>
<p>Traders said they see strong support at 2,500, although some see the market falling further if the left does grab the votes.</p>
<p>JP Morgan equities strategist Gary Dugan sees the CAC falling as much as eight percent on the week if the Socialists win and rise as much as six percent on a conservative victory.  </p>
<p>Traders said bargain-hunting by domestic funds helped turn the market higher in late afternoon trading, with reports of selling by non-domestic investors.</p>
<p>A victory for the left could benefit stocks in the consumer goods sector but hit banks, services such as Generale des Eaux and defence companies, they said.</p>
<p>* Renault was among worst hit, down 4.55 percent at 123.8, on a view the left would block or delay restructuring moves.</p>
<p>* Thomson-CSF sheds 2.08 percent as the Socialists would torpedo its privatisation.  </p>
<p>* Canal Plus closed down 2.69 percent at 978, after falling to a year low to 971 francs after the Spanish parliament approved legislation ending the monopoly enjoyed by Canal Plus and its Spanish allies in broadcasting soccer matches.</p>
