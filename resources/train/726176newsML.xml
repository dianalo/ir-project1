<headline>Late NYMEX Hub natgas scores more gains on weather.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-14</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures continued to move higher late Monday in lackluster activity, powered by revised forecasts calling for mostly above-normal U.S. weather this week, industry sources said.</p>
<p>At 1405 EDT, August was up 5.6 cents at $2.15 per million British thermal units, while September was 3.6 cents higher at $2.14. Most others were up by one-half to 2.5 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically, I think we should be moving lower, but with cash holding firm and still over the screen, there's not much reason to sell it here,&quot; said one Texas-based trader, noting hot U.S. weather helped firm the cash today.</p>
<p>Chart traders said an August close above near-resistance at $2.15 could set up a test of key resistance along the down trendline in the $2.24 area. Support was still seen at last week's $2.051 low, with psychological buying likely at $2.</p>
<p>Heat and humidity are expected to plague the Northeast this week though levels should moderate some from the mid-90s F today. Temperatures in most other regions also were forecast at above-normal for the period.</p>
<p>In the cash Monday, Gulf Coast prices firmed two to three cents to the mid-teens. Midcon pipes were up a similar amount to the $2.05-06 area. New York city gate gas jumped more than a nickel to the mid-to-high $2.40s.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 12,009 contracts traded at 1340 EDT. Hub open interest on July 11 rose 434 contracts to 201,218.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, August climbed 4.8 cents to $2.04, while deferreds were still steady to three cents higher. The East/West spread widened by 0.8 cent to 11.0 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
