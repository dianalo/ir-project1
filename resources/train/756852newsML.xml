<title>NEW ZEALAND: Former Tradenz ceo Christie leaves ANZ Bank - paper.</title>
<headline>Former Tradenz ceo Christie leaves ANZ Bank - paper.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1997-07-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>High-profile executive Rick Christie has quit as head of ANZ Bank's international banking group in a surprise move after just six months in the job, Wellington's Evening Post newspaper reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Christie, 55, previously chief executive of trade body Tradenz for six years, was head-hunted to ANZ Bank by its New Zealand managing director, Steve Jones. Jones later left the bank.</p>
<p>Christie said part of the reason he resigned was the almost complete change in senior management at ANZ.  </p>
<p>Alister Maitland, the Melbourne-based executive director of international banking, had retired, Jones had left, and Australian chief executive officer Don Mercer was to leave next year, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;My feeling is that the original vision that we shared when I came on board has fundamentally changed and, because of that, I have decided to strike out and do something else,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When Christie joined ANZ, Jones hailed his appointment, saying it would add more &quot;management push power&quot; to its international banking business in New Zealand.  </p>
<p>The bank had been looking for someone who understood what firms needed from their bank. A person with these skills, such as Christie, would complement ANZ's range of financial capabilities, Jones said.</p>
<p>&quot;We realised that there was a person in the country who was uniquely placed to do that. The problem was he was chief executive of Tradenz,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite his early departure, Christie said there was no acrimony and he left the bank on good terms three weeks ago.</p>
<p>It was his decision to leave, he said.  </p>
<p>Christie said he was pursuing a number of job opportunities, including some directorships, and had recently turned down a position overseas.</p>
