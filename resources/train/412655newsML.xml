<p>It was the sort of occasion that would have turned a few more hairs grey in Kevin Keegan's head.</p>
<p>Newcastle United, playing with composure, style and teamwork were creating -- but failing -- to take chance after chance against Southampton at St James' Park in Saturday afternoon's premier league struggle.</p>
<p>Then, after 56 minutes Matthew Le Tissier showed them how it should be done, cracking home a left foot shot which gave Southampton a 1-0 victory.</p>
<p>The goal provided the Saints renewed hope of avoiding relegation, at the same time as putting a huge dent in Newcastle's championship aspirations. At the end of the match, Newcastle fans sat with their heads in their hands in disbelief after another cruel, upset defeat.</p>
<p>Last season, as Newcastle blew a 12-point lead and ultimately lost the title to Manchester United, TV images of Keegan's face, contorted with emotion, empty eyes searching for an answer, hair turning greyer almost while the match was in progress, told a vivid tale of the agonies he was suffering.</p>
<p>The fans suffered with him.</p>
<p>Grown men cried as Newcastle lost or drew matches they ought to have won. The whole city of Newcastle saw the title snatched away from them in the same way as someone who had just been told they had won 10 million pounds on the lottery -- but then got home to discover their winning ticket had been eaten by the family dog.</p>
<p>Keegan's angst continued until early in January when he decided enough was enough. He quit the club he had helped re-discover its heart and soul after more than a decade in the doldrums, handing over to Kenny Dalglish to complete the job he started.</p>
<p>On Saturday lunchtime, with Newcastle playing at home against one of his old teams, Keegan said in a TV interview he really believed he was finished with soccer and was not planning to return to the game.</p>
<p>Although he has joined ITV as an analyst  he said that was about as far as his involvement in football would go.</p>
<p>&quot;I am looking forward to my new life away from football. I really enjoyed my five years but there's a time to come and a time to go. The future is really interesting,&quot; Keegan told ITV.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage I would say &quot;that's it&quot;, but you never say &quot;never again&quot; in life.</p>
<p>&quot;Life goes on and I am really enjoying not having to wake up and go to a football club, as much as I enjoyed it in the early years at Newcastle, so I won't be going back to St James' &quot;</p>
<p>Keegan said he would make an exception for Peter Beardsley, and would return for his testimonial.</p>
<p>&quot;That should be at the end of next season. If I was to go back that's the only fellow I would go back for, because I think the world of him.&quot;</p>
<p>Keegan has been in Florida and Spain, generally enjoying his life for the past two months.</p>
<p>On Saturday he said something that he could never have uttered publicly before -- that his old rivals Manchester United could win the European Cup this season.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Manchester United will beat Porto next week and go all the way and I really hope they do. Man United fans have not seen the best of Andy Cole yet either. Cream rises to the top -- maybe Europe will be his stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Keegan was the man who stunned Newcastle fans when he sold Cole to United two years ago and he had plenty of other surprises for them during his five years at St James' Park.</p>
<p>He has just signed a 500,000 pounds ($800,000) book deal to tell his life story -- and the real reason of his sudden departure from Newcastle.</p>
<p>Rumours abound, but Keegan has not yet told the complete story. Seeing Newcastle lose to Southampton on Saturday probably gives a hint of why he went -- but fans will have to wait until the autumn for the book's publication to learn the truth.</p>
<p>In the meantime they can still keep in touch with their old hero. But only on the television.</p>
