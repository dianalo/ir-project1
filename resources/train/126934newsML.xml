<headline>National carlot beef trade weekly review - USDA.</headline>
<dateline>DES MOINES 1996-10-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Boxed beef trading was lower on moderate to fairly good demand and moderate to heavy offerings on Select product, and mostly moderate offerings on Choice product, USDA said.</p>
<p>Retail and HRI demand was fairly firm for immediate needs, while forward interests continued to show some improvement on generally all cuts. Some interest was noted in the export market late in the week, but generally continued slow.</p>
<p>Rib and round cuts were generally under the most pressure for the week, with select cuts pressured the most.  </p>
<p>Loin cuts followed somewhat the same pattern with Select cuts trading lower, and the heavy Choice cuts also trading at lower price levels. Chuck cuts trended lower throughout the trading period, with the most downward pressure again on the Select cuts. Closely trimmed items traded lower, on good demand both in the Select and Choice graded cuts.</p>
<p>Beef trimmings traded lower on fairly good demand and mostly moderate offerings. Fed cattle and blended coarse ground generally steady on moderate demand and offerings.</p>
<p>For the week - Select and Choice rib primal 1.00 to 5.00 lower; Select and Choice chuck primal 1.00 to 3.00 lower; Select and Choice round primal 2.50 to 4.00 lower; Select loin primal 1.00 to 2.00 lower, Choice loin primal 1.00 higher; Closely trimmed items 1.00 to 2.00 lower; Beef trimmings 1.50 lower; Fed cattle and blended coarse ground generally steady.</p>
<p>The Estimated Composite of Boxed Beef Cutout values of Choice 1-3 550/700 carcasses Dn 1.58 at 107.98; 700/850 Dn 1.51 at 106.37; Select 1-3 550/700 carcasses Dn 1.90 at 99.59; 700/850 Dn 2.31 at 98.02.</p>
<p>COW AND BULL CARCASS, BONELESS PROCESSING BEEF, CUTTER COW CUTOUT -  The lean boneless beef market traded sharply higher on moderate to good demand for light offerings. Supplies and offerings were limited this week because the marketing of slaughter cows was curtailed in the upper Midwest by the fall grain harvest season.</p>
<p>As the week progressed, supplies tightened and demand in turn improved as buyers actively sought product to fill grinding needs. Further, lower lean percentage boneless beef traded steady-firm on light demand and moderate offerings.</p>
<p>The cow carcasses market inched upward due to the limited number of slaughter cow. Additionally, the cow cuts complex traded uneven, with the tenderloins moving weak to lower and the majority of the other cuts trading steady to firm. Demand remains light for light to moderate offerings.</p>
<p>Utility carcasses steady to 2.00 higher; Cutter firm; Fresh 90% boneless beef 6.00-7.00 higher; 85% 2.00-5.00 higher; 75% mostly 2.00 higher; 65% steady to firm. The Cutter cow carcass gross cut-out value for Thursday, October 18, 1996 was estimated at 70.21 per cwt., up 2.89 from last week.</p>
