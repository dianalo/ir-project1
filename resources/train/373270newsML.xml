<p>Britain called on Iran on Wednesday to denounce an increased bounty offered for the killing of British writer Salman Rushdie.</p>
<p>But a leading Iranian politician distanced his government from the new offer of a $2.5 million reward and said Tehran's policy on the author of the novel,&quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, had not changed.</p>
<p>Mohammad Javad Larijani, deputy chairman of the Iranian Majlis (parliament) foreign relations committee, said the 15th Khordad (June Fifth) Foundation, which offered the increased reward, was a charitable body that did not represent the government.</p>
<p>&quot;This foundation can say anything they want,&quot; Larijani told a London news conference. &quot;The position of the government is as it was before. The government of Iran is not going to despatch any death squads to kill the citizen of another country.&quot;</p>
<p>Larijani was speaking as Iran's President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani used a Tehran news conference to say his government had nothing to do with the new reward.</p>
<p>The foundation first offered the bounty in 1989 after Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or religious edict, imposing a &quot;death sentence&quot; on Rushdie for alleged blasphemy against Islam in &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;.</p>
<p>Since then, Rushdie has been under 24-hour police protection, although he has in the past year been increasing the number of public appearances he makes.</p>
<p>Iranian officials say the ruling is a purely religious matter, unrelated to the government. They stress it cannot withdraw a religious edict.</p>
<p>Ayatollah Hassan Sanei, head of the foundation, was quoted by the daily Jomhuri Eslami on Wednesday as saying the charity would raise the award by $500,000.</p>
<p>The British Foreign Office said it had noted Sanei's announcement &quot;with great concern&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We condemn the bounty as we condemn the fatwa itself as an outrageous infringement of Mr Rushdie's fundamental rights,&quot; a statement said.</p>
<p>It said it did not accept that the 15th Khordad Foundation had nothing to do with the Iranian government.</p>
<p>&quot;We call on President Rafsanjani specifically to condemn the bounty,&quot; the Foreign Office statement added.</p>
<p>The Guardian newspaper meanwhile said that security surrounding Rushdie had been stepped up following the discovery of fresh plans to carry out the death threat.</p>
