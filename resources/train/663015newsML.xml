<p>The dollar steadied in quiet, late European trade near its session lows as the market digested an agreement on an EMU budget stability pact and looked ahead to this week's G7 summit meeting.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark was lifted earlier as it emerged that EU finance ministers agreed on a single currency stability pact, raising the prospect of a timely, though weaker, start to the euro.</p>
<p>But the dollar gave up those gains, edging back below 1.73 marks as profit-taking emerged in the dollar and sterling against the mark. Meantime, heavy yen buying, particularly against the mark, pressured dollar/yen lower.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was no surprise out of the stability pact and some profit-takers have come out,&quot; said a U.S. bank dealer. &quot;There's no reason why anyone would want to be long marks after the stability pact agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.7280/90 marks at 1327 GMT against 1.7365/75 late Friday in Europe. Dollar/yen was softer at 113.35/45 from 114.65/75 yen Friday.</p>
<p>Mark/yen, meantime, slipped to 65.53/65 from 65.99/02.</p>
<p>EU finance ministers today reached a compromise deal on the EMU stability pact by also agreeing to a resolution on jobs and growth, defusing a row between Germany and France.  </p>
<p>The finance ministers' deal was approved by EU leaders at their mid-year summit in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>&quot;It's positive for the market to get the jobs agreement because that is essentially what's already been priced in,&quot; said Teis Knuthsen, international economist at First Chicago. &quot;I fail to see how this will improve unemployment in Europe, as that is a structural problem, but it does put EMU on track for 1999.&quot;</p>
<p>Market focus has now turned to this week's Japanese and U.S. trade data which will be more acutely felt as they come just before the G7 summit in Denver, Colorado on June 20-22.  </p>
<p>Figures out Tuesday are expected to show Japan's trade surplus grew in May, while April U.S. data out Thursday are forecast to reveal the opposite, widening the trade gap.</p>
<p>However, an international monetary source said today G7 leaders may not single out Japan's surplus.</p>
<p>&quot;The Japanese are hoping the trade number won't be a very poor one, and the U.S. the same, or there'll be increased criticism when they meet,&quot; said Peter Wood, trader at Bank of Boston in London.</p>
<p>Dealers noted heavy buying in Europe today of yen against the mark, sterling and the dollar.  </p>
<p>The dollar made a strong recovery after last week's slide against the yen which saw it trade below 111, but dealers said the risk was still to the downside ahead of the trade numbers and the G7 summit.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/yen looks like it will settle into a 113-115 range for now but fears of higher Japan rates and U.S-Japan trade friction are still circulating and that's going to keep dollar/yen capped,&quot; said the U.S. bank dealer.</p>
