<p>The arrest of North Koreans in a major drug seizure in Japan last week may be a sign that the famine-stricken state is becoming desperate in its attempts to raise cash, Japanese intelligence sources and analysts say.</p>
<p>Japanese police arrested three North Korean nationals on suspicion of smuggling a huge cache of stimulants in cargo labelled as honey on the North Korean-registered Ji Song-2. The 1,499-tonne freighter left North Korea's Nanpo port on April 5.</p>
<p>Investigators found 70 kg (154 lb) of amphetamines with a street value estimated at 11.9 billion yen ($95 million) in cargo from the ship after it docked at the port of Hososhima on the Pacific coast island of Kyushu.</p>
<p>The North Korean captain of the freighter was arrested along with two other pro-Pyongyang Korean residents of Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese intelligence sources believe the North Korean government may have been behind what they say could be the biggest ever drug smuggling case involving North Koreans.</p>
<p>&quot;When we come to think of North Korea, it strictly controls activities of its citizens. We must suspect that the smuggling was carried out or approved by the government,&quot; one Japanese government intelligence source told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest motive behind the case must have been cash,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Cash-strapped North Korea, gripped by famine after two consecutive years of flooding, may have been cornered into taking steps unacceptable to the international community, another intelligence source said.</p>
<p>&quot;For North Korea, which now has almost nothing convertible into cash, there aren't many sources of foreign exchange,&quot; the source said. &quot;They are becoming ever more desperate.&quot;</p>
<p>Northeast Asia expert Nozomu Akizuki said: &quot;Their smuggling operation was very unprofessional. If you were professional, you would never bring in drugs in such large quantities at one time.&quot;</p>
<p>Akizuki, of Meiji Gakuin University in Tokyo, added: &quot;They may have targeted Japan because Japan is one of the easiest countries in which to sell amphetamines.&quot;</p>
<p>The intelligence sources said North Korea was losing many of its traditional financial supporters abroad, including ethnic Koreans living in Japan.</p>
<p>About one-third of Japan's 666,000-strong ethnic Korean community supports North Korea. Almost all are descendants of workers or students who came to Japan when Korea was a Japanese colony in the first half of this century.</p>
<p>&quot;Korean residents of Japan, particularly the younger generation, are changing. They have stopped sending cash to their homeland as they used to,&quot; the intelligence source said.</p>
<p>Apart from Japan's prolonged economic recession, many ethnic Koreans have gradually been squeezed out of the 30 trillion yen ($240 billion) Japanese pinball or &quot;pachinko&quot; industry, the source said.</p>
<p>Until a few years ago, about one-third of Japan's 19,000 pachinko gaming halls were run by pro-Pyongyang Koreans. &quot;They are now losing the game to Japanese companies,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The alleged drug smuggling could not only tarnish North Korea's image but may also hand Tokyo a reason not to pledge new food aid to Pyongyang, Akizuki said.</p>
<p>Japan is holding back its decision to give food aid to famine-stricken North Korea partly because of public anger over allegations that North Korea kidnapped and spirited away several Japanese citizens to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&quot;The abduction allegations and the case of smuggling would certainly make the Japanese government more reluctant to extend food aid to North Korea,&quot; Akizuki said. ($1=125 yen)</p>
