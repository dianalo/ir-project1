<p>French financial futures markets tumbled in unusually heavy pre-session electronic trading on Monday after the combined left outpolled the centre-right coalition in the first round of France's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>The franc also fell, slipping to 3.3773 per mark, through its low of 3.3755 per mark reached late on Sunday night after first projections by polling institutes showed the left solidly ahead of the right.</p>
<p>May CAC-40 stock market futures showed an equally sharp drop, indicating a Paris bourse opening as much as three percent lower. The bourse opens at 0800 GMT.</p>
<p>June PIBOR futures opened 17 basis points lower at 96.30 and kept falling, slumping as much as 34 basis points. At 0600 GMT, it was off 28 basis points.</p>
<p>Bond futures were hit just as hard, with the June contract dropping as low as 128, a full point down from its level on Friday. PIBOR and bond futures pit trading starts at 0630 GMT.</p>
<p>Voters sent President Jacques Chirac and his ruling centre-right coalition a severe warning in the first of the election's two rounds, giving the combined left a 4.5-point lead and raising the prospect that the Gaullist president may have to share power with a hostile, Socialist-led government after next Sunday's decisive runoff ballot.</p>
<p>Traders said there was initial selling of bond and PIBOR contracts by domestic investors, mostly hedging other positions, and foreign investors. They said the market would stay jittery partly because opinion polls prior to the first round were wrong about seat projections.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nervousness because no-one knows where we are. The polls were roughly right in terms of the share of the votes but were totally wrong on the sharing of seats,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said the market was not panicking since the final result of the election could still turn out favourably for the centre-right.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly the market's not panicking. The most hit is PIBOR as people are not shooting against the franc. There's some selling by domestic investors...some out of London and some out of New York,&quot; the dealer, head of a French brokerage said. &quot;Traders who were short are cashing profits.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People are drawing big question marks. Today the left has won on paper, it could be totally opposite next weekend,&quot; he said. Another trader at a large French bank said most of the early action they had seen came from local traders in Paris.</p>
<p>Some share analysts said on Sunday night after seeing the initial results the stock market could fall as much as five percent in the coming week.</p>
<p>With most votes counted in metropolitan France, the Interior Ministry said the combined left had polled 40.1 percent, the RPR-UDF coalition and other right-wing candidates 36.5 percent and the extreme-right National Front 15 percent. Ecologists scored 6.8 percent.</p>
<p>Most of the 577 National Assembly seats were set to go to a runoff, where the behaviour of National Front supporters and of the 31.6 percent of voters who abstained will be crucial.</p>
<p>The outcome may hinge on the 22 seats in France's overseas departments and territories. Polling stations were still open in the Caribbean and South America long after they closed in Paris.</p>
