<title>USA: O.J. Simpson begins testimony in civil trial.</title>
<headline>O.J. Simpson begins testimony in civil trial.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA MONICA, Calif 1996-11-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>O.J. Simpson took the witness stand for the first time Friday to face questions in his civil trial about the night his ex-wife and her friend were murdered.</p>
<p>The former football star, who never testified during last year's criminal trial, was expected to be grilled for several days by attorneys for the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.  </p>
<p>Simpson was acquitted of double-murder charges on Oct. 3, 1995, and has continued to maintain his innocence. But he is now charged in a wrongful-death civil suit brought by the victims' families.</p>
<p>Simpson was called by the plaintiffs' lawyers, who hope to hammer away at his credibility in front of the jury. His own defence attorneys will have a chance to cross-examine him and try to undo any damage.</p>
<p>Simpson's testimony followed a lineup of witnesses meant to establish that Simpson had the motive and the opportunity to commit the June 1994 murders.</p>
<p>Dozens of camera crews swarmed over the lawn outside the Santa Monica courthouse, but the scene was far more subdued than the media frenzy that surrounded the first trial. Cameras have been banned from court, and attorneys for both sides are under a strict &quot;gag order&quot; that prevents them from commenting publicly on the case.</p>
