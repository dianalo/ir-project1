<p>Phone calls poured in on Wednesday to a Hungarian office processing claims to dormant Swiss bank accounts that include assets left by Jewish Holocaust victims, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say the telephone rang every 10 minutes or so,&quot; said Tamas Szabo of Ernst and Young, whose Hungary office is processing claims from Eastern Europe, much of the former Soviet Union and Greece.</p>
<p>The calls coincided with the publication of an unprecedented advertisement in leading newspapers listing more than 2,000 names on dormant Swiss bank accounts opened by foreigners before 1945.</p>
<p>The publication, breaking with a tradition of secrecy concerning the Swiss accounts, followed heavy pressure from Jewish groups.</p>
<p>A Swiss banker familiar with the search for Holocaust victims' money ordered by Swiss banking authorities said the total in the accounts was around 60 million Swiss francs ($40 million).</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, Ernst and Young's Budapest office had fielded at least three dozen calls from potential claimants, Szabo told Reuters. Other claims offices are located in New York, Tel Aviv, Basle and Sydney.</p>
<p>Szabo said his office was staffed by 20 people speaking the native tongues spoken by the callers.</p>
<p>He said that claimants had six months from the publication date to file their claims, after which the evaluation process would begin.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to tell at the moment, but I suspect there are some possible matches,&quot; Szabo, a partner in the international accounting firm, added.</p>
<p>&quot;It is certainly our intention to make it (the evaluation) as quick as possible but it is difficult to tell now how long it will take,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The effort finally to resolve the issue of the ownership of the dormant accounts was welcomed by the Hungarian Jewish community, the biggest remaining in Eastern Europe following the Nazi effort to exterminate the Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very, very big step because it is the only way to resolve this problem, by taking it to the newspapers where millions of people can see it,&quot; said Peter Feldmajer, spokesman for the Federation of Jewish Communities of Hungary.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will work because in the United States, and in Israel and in other Eastern European countries, people can read it and a name may be similiar to other names and then people can talk about it and it will work.&quot;</p>
<p>Feldmajer added that he had not been in touch with the Ernst and Young office but had received a call from an irate Hungarian Jew whose father's name was not on the list.</p>
<p>&quot;One person called me and he is very angry because his father had an account and his father's name is not on the list,&quot; Feldmajer said.</p>
<p>He added that money not reclaimed by the inheritors of the dormant accounts was earmarked to be turned over to Jewish charities in the country of origin.</p>
