<p>Albania's President Sali Berisha warned the incoming government on Sunday against making major constitutional changes, saying it had been elected in imperfect conditions and lacked the necessary mandate.</p>
<p>Commenting on plans by the Socialists and their coalition allies to increase the powers of the prime minister, Berisha said the system he established had adequately separated the powers of the head of state and head of government.</p>
<p>&quot;The change of constitutional laws with this parliament that has not come out of free and fair elections which were accepted in the existing conditions by Albanian political forces and the international organisations... constitute a grave violation of the constitution and could have potentially destabilising consequences for the country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Election monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the election, in which Berisha's Democrats suffered a resounding defeat, had been acceptable, if far from perfect.</p>
<p>The vote was called in March after the collapse of pyramid savings funds triggered a violent rebellion that led to more than 1,500 deaths, prompting Berisha's government to resign.</p>
<p>In the statement broadcast on national television, Berisha reaffirmed his determination not to stay on as president cohabiting with the incoming Socialist government. Parliament is expected to meet for the first time later this week.</p>
<p>&quot;I am resolved to perform a constructive role in opposition,&quot; Berisha said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I think the process of changing constitutional laws and drafting a new constitution should not be undertaken by a parliament that has been accepted as a political solution.&quot;</p>
<p>A statement from the Socialists and two allied parties published in the daily Koha Jone on Sunday said they wanted a parliamentary republic with executive power concentrated in the hands of the prime minister controlled by parliament, rather than in the president.</p>
<p>With all but two seats decided, the Socialists have 99 seats in the 153-seat parliament, plus another 15 held by their coalition allies, giving the new government a two-thirds majority needed for major legislative changes. Berisha's Democratic Party has just 29 seats.</p>
