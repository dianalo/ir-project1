<title>COLOMBIA: Colombian stocks end lower for sixth day.</title>

<p>Colombian stocks ended lower for the sixth consecutive day in quiet trading in Bogota and Medellin.</p>
<p>Medellin's IBOMED general price index fell 3.90 percent to end at 15,103.75 on a lackluster trading volume of 1.2 billion pesos. Bogota's IBB shed 2.38 percent, closing at 963.01 on a volume of 1.7 billion pesos.</p>
<p>After a phenomenal rise earlier this month, traders said most investors now appeared to be wary of the market and were looking ahead to Washington's March 1 decision on whether to decertify Colombia for a second consecutive year for not participating actively enough in the anti-drug war.  </p>
<p>Renewed decertification could trigger punitive U.S. commercial sanctions which Washington decided against imposing on Colombia last year. Investors are also looking at fallout from a series of measures announced as part of a state of economic emergency declared last week to narrow the central government's widening trade deficit, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreign funds are what move the market,&quot; one Bogota- based broker said. &quot;When they aren't around any drop (in prices) is critical.&quot;</p>
<p>The day's biggest losers in Bogota included brewer Bavaria, which fell 8.45 percent to end at 5,200 pesos a share.  </p>
<p>Bancoquia dropped 7.87 percent to close at 2,423 pesos per share and cigarette-maker Coltabaco, of the powerful Sindicato Antioqueno conglomerate, fell 8.37 percent to end at 3,500 pesos per share.</p>
<p>&quot;All three stocks had been in demand by foreign funds. But the funds have stopped buying until all the emergency (economic) measures are announced and there's some certainty about possible economic sanctions,&quot; another Bogota-based trader said.</p>
<p>In Medellin, losers were led by discount retailer Almacenes Exito, which fell 10.12 percent, and by Nacional de Chocolates, which ended down 8.35 percent.</p>
