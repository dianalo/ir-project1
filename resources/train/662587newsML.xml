<p>The Luxembourg presidency of the European Union may call a special summit meeting in October to address the region's high unemployment, a spokesman for the Luxembourg delegation said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Several countries have approached us and we would be willing,&quot; Guy Schuller, spokesman for Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, said in answer to Reuter enquiries.  </p>
<p>The possibility of a jobs summit was immediately confirmed by Juncker himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Some countries have come with the idea of this. It seems to be excellent under the condition that we know clearly what we want,&quot; Juencker told French daily Le Figaro in an interview to be published in Monday's edition.</p>
<p>French demands to put the plight of Europe's 18 million joblessness high on the agenda for the June 16-17 Amsterdam summit of EU leaders has turned the meeting into one of the most contentious the EU has seen.</p>
<p>A jobs summit was being seen by officials on the sidelines of the meeting as one possible way to acknowledge the demands of the new French left-wing government without making immediate promises to commit funds to job creation programmes.</p>
