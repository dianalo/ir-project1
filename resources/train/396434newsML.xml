<p>A blazing 79 off 76 balls from all-rounder Chris Cairns carried New Zealand to 253 for eight in their second one-day cricket international against England at Eden Park on Sunday.</p>
<p>Cairns, playing as a batsman because of a persistent ankle injury, clubbed three sixes and five fours before being run out.</p>
<p>He added 42 with Stephen Fleming and 51 in 76 balls with Chris Harris to help push New Zealand to a competitive total after they had won the toss and elected on to bat first in hot, sticky conditions.</p>
<p>Opener Bryan Young got the innings off to a brisk start with 46 in 59 balls but both Fleming and Harris struggled to maintain the momentum.</p>
<p>The innings ended with a flourish as Dipak Patel and Gavin Larsen cracked 34 in 13 minutes off 22 balls, Patel lifting fast-medium Dominic Cork into the crowd over long on in making 24 off as many balls.</p>
<p>England's bowlers were wayward for much of the innings, bowling 16 wides, with Alan Mullally and Andrew Caddick -- who bowled four of his five in one over -- being the worst offenders.</p>
<p>Medium pacer Ronnie Irani, in a rare tour appearance, and offspinner Robert Croft were the tidiest of the England bowlers.</p>
<p>England were helped by three run outs, the most decisive being Cork's follow through off his own bowling to dismiss Cairns.</p>
<p>Irani's smart piece of work ran out Adam Parore, who was sent back attempting a short single, while Caddick's accurate throw from long on just beat Patel home off the final ball of the innings.</p>
<p>England will need a shade over five runs an over to win and take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.</p>
