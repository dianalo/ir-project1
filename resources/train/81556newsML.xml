<p>A U.S. supermarket tabloid beat the world's paparazzi to publish the first honeymoon pictures of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his bride on Friday after tracking them down in Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;We followed them on their honeymoon and got them in Istanbul, Turkey, and we photographed them,&quot; said Tony Frost, editor of the Boca Raton, Fla.-based Globe.</p>
<p>In an issue bearing the screaming cover headlines, &quot;JFK Jr's Exotic Honeymoon&quot; and &quot;Souvenir Special! Exclusive Wedding Album,&quot; the paper promises &quot;15 intimate photos&quot; of Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette.</p>
<p>Kennedy, once dubbed &quot;the sexiest man alive&quot; by People magazine, and Bessette had managed to elude the press when they secretly married on an island off Georgia last weekend.</p>
<p>But Frost said a team of reporters from the Globe was able to secretly follow the couple to the eastern Mediterranean country and tracked them for three days as they saw the sights in the historic city.</p>
<p>&quot;The first we saw of John was Tuesday morning sitting on a chaise longue by the pool. He was wearing black swimming trunks,&quot; Frost said. He said Kennedy was reading a newspaper and laughing at reports the couple were on a yacht off the U.S. east coast. He said he instructed his crew to follow them at a distance, but not to disturb their honeymoon.</p>
<p>Frost said Kennedy seemed resigned when he spotted a Globe photographer, grabbing his wife's hand and kissing it in an echo of their wedding photo.</p>
<p>&quot;He was very sporting about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Frost said he knew where the couple had gone after leaving Turkey, but would not say. He said the tabloid had not paid for information on their whereabouts.</p>
