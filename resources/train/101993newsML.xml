<p>Lower profits from troubled base metals producers are clouding the otherwise improving corporate earnings picture for Canadian companies in the third quarter, analysts said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Richardson Greenshields of Canada analyst Dunnery Best forecast &quot;very substantial declines in earnings&quot; for major base metal firms.</p>
<p>&quot;I think almost everywhere else you're going to see improvements year-over-year,&quot; Best said.</p>
<p>Canada's third-quarter earnings season is to kick off when Alcan Aluminium Ltd. reports on Thursday.</p>
<p>Best said he expects Alcan third-quarter earnings to fall to $0.35 a share from year earlier $0.61 a share, which came before an extraordinary loss of $1.24 a share for an asset writedown.</p>
<p>&quot;There's some concerns that the metal group may not exactly report the (expected) numbers,&quot; Griffiths McBurney analyst Greg Misztela agreed.</p>
<p>Companies such as Inco Ltd., Noranda Inc. and Falconbridge Ltd. are likely to see earnings declines, Best said. One exception is likely to be Teck Corp. &quot;Teck has a lot of coal in its production lineup and coal's been strong, so that will be the one offset,&quot; Best said.</p>
<p>But investors have anticipated disappointments, causing metal stock prices to slide after second-quarter earnings were hit by a drop in copper, nickel and other prices.</p>
<p>Markets were rocked in mid-June by the news that Sumitomo Corp. fired its head copper trader after he allegedly ran up a $1.8 billion loss.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast that Canada's major banks will lead the pack in earnings gains. The banks were expected to report their results for the quarter ended Oct. 31 in early December.</p>
<p>&quot;They'll have a very good year-over-year comparison. I think quarter-over-quarter won't be quite as good,&quot; said Royal Bank of Canada vice-president of equities John Kellett.</p>
<p>The six largest banks, including Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, have posted a string of record profits in recent years.</p>
<p>Best said Richardson Greenshields has increased earnings estimates for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce six times so far this year.</p>
<p>Consumer products earnings will also rise, analysts said.</p>
<p>Another strong area will be Canada's important gold sector, which was buoyed by firmer bullion prices.</p>
<p>Earnings at energy firms will be fuelled by higher crude oil prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>Retail firms will benefit from recent cuts in short-term interest rates by Canada's central bank, spurring consumers to borrow and shop. &quot;Bit by bit the underpinnings are being put in place for a more confident consumer that would eventually lead to better times,&quot; Kellett said.</p>
<p>Some high-technology firms have said they will report losses in the upcoming quarter, including Gandalf Technologies Inc. and Corel Corp., due to problems getting their products to market.</p>
<p>But technology heavyweights such as Northern Telecom Ltd. and Newbridge Networks Corp. will see higher earnings, Best said.</p>
