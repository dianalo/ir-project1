<p>The higher-than-expected 1.9 percent rise in Polish consumer prices in September is seen delaying a central bank interest rate cut until the first quarter of 1997, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Markets expected the CPI index to rise month-on-month 1.4 percent in September, while the finance ministry and central bank said the year-on-year index would fall to 19 percent from 20.5 percent in August.</p>
<p>&quot;The (government) target of 17 percent year-on-year inflation in 1996 is pure fiction...and the next possible interest rate cut is not likely to happen before early 1997,&quot; Pawel Krawczykiewicz, analyst at PBI SA, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Central Statistical Office said on Tuesday the September month-on-month price growth was 1.9 percent against 0.5 percent rise in August which took the year-on-year index down to 19.5 percent from 21.6 percent in December 1995. @</p>
<p>Krawczykiewicz said he expected year-on-year inflation to ease to about 18.7 percent at the end of the year, still to high for the National Bank of Poland to pare its official interest rates, now at 25 and 22 percent.</p>
<p>The NBP last lowered rates by one percent on July 16, but year-on-year inflation rebounded from June's low of 19.5 percent July's high at 20.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought that there might be room to pare rates before the end of the year, but with 1996 inflation likely around 19 percent, any rate cut will likely wait until January figures are known,&quot; said Piotr Kazimierczyk, chief economist at PBR SA.</p>
<p>Last month the NBP, worried by the fast growth of credit to households and the possibility of a boom in imports, said it would strive to keep real interest rates rising in the near-term to protect the country's current account.</p>
<p>Analysts expected prices to continue to grow in the coming months, propelled by October's five percent rise in utility prices and increases in petrol and diesel prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Long delayed government controlled price hikes are likely to keep (year-ony-ear) inflation from falling and may keep it from reaching the 15 percent level at the end of 1997,&quot; Kazimierczyk said.</p>
<p>Analysts also said indexed increases of government sector wages and pensions, to compensate for the higher 1996 inflation now likely top the 17 percent budget plan, would create additional inflation impulses.</p>
<p>&quot;Enterprise sector wages have been growing at six percent in real terms this year and public sector wages will grow as well, which may cause an inflationary demand surge,&quot; said Tadeusz Chroscicki, chief analyst at the Planning Ministry.</p>
<p>Analysts said food prices, which grew by 2.7 percent in September and were at year-on-year 20.2 percent, were not likely to dramatically slow their pace of growth this year because of incrased demand around Christmas.</p>
<p>Some were sour over the Finance Minster Grzegorz Kolodko and the central bank's statements that year-on-year inflation would fall to around 19 percent in September, saying that such information was mis-leading and did not reflect facts.</p>
<p>&quot;Kolodko and the central bank again showed a good face to bad cards, they should stop doing this if they want a mature market,&quot; one analyst at a Polish bank said.</p>
