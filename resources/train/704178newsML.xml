<p>Cameroon's Belgian coach Henri Depireux has quit in the middle of his team's bid to qualify for next year's World and African Nations Cup finals.</p>
<p>&quot;There no longer exists any collaboration between me and my employers,&quot; Depireux said in a letter of resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;Cameroonians don't adhere to my methods. For this and other reasons I have decided to abrogate my two-year contract with the soccer authorities.&quot;</p>
<p>The Indomitable Lions won many fans abroad for their thrilling performance in the 1990 World Cup when they reached the quarter-finals. They also qualified for the 1994 finals but failed to reach the last 16.</p>
<p>Critics of Depireux, appointed in Sepember 1996, say he has been unable to come up with a winning formula.</p>
<p>They drew 2-2 at home against Gabon in their last outing in the Nations Cup after enjoying a 2-0 lead.</p>
<p>No replacement has been named. Youth and Sports Ministry sources say five locally-based coaches would be appointed to steer the team through the final qualifying stages of the World and African Nations Cups.</p>
