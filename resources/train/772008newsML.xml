<headline>Russian piano maestro Richter dead at 82.</headline>

<p>Svyatoslav Richter, one of the greatest pianists  of the 20th century, died of a heart ailment in Moscow on Friday at  the age of 82, an official at the city's elite Central Clinical Hospital  told Reuters.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said Richter, who had spent his last few years  in Paris, had returned to Russia a month ago.</p>
<p>Born in Zhitomir in Ukraine in 1915, he was already a leading musical  figure in Odessa in the 1930s before moving to Moscow. He went on  to win many of his country's top honours and toured internationally.</p>
<p>In his later years he became increasingly reclusive and some of his  rare performances were marked by a certain eccentricity in presentation.</p>
<p>He was particularly known for his interpretations of Bach and of his  great Russian contemporary Dmitry Shostakovich, but his repertoire  encompassed the great classics of European music, including Beethoven,  and Russia's Sergei Prokofiev.</p>
