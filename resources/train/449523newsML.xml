<p>Toronto stocks ended weaker in brisk turnover on Tuesday, pulled down by weakness on Wall Street and a tumbling financial sector.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index lost 25.26 points to 6129.28. Trading was active as 106.6 million shares worth C$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion) changed hands.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 58.92 points to 6896.56 and Canada's banking group dropped almost one percent.</p>
<p>Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels said Toronto's market had traded in a narrow range recently as investors debated a possible hike in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Once rates go up, bond yields increase and bond prices drop, attracting investors who then sell interest-sensitive issues such as banks. The bearish players believe rates will rise, while others think Canada's key index will sustain only a temporary setback before resuming its upward march.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel there has been a constant fight recently between the bulls and the bears,&quot; Meisels said. He forecast Toronto would soon reverse its downward trend as investors hunted for bargains.</p>
<p>Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, nine fell, led by consumer products, base metals, banks and transports. Gaining groups included conglomerates, oils and golds.</p>
<p>Declining stocks outnumbered advances 561 to 397, while 299 traded unchanged.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, Wascana Energy Inc. topped Toronto actives after Tuesday's news that Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. said it planned a C$20.50 ($14.97) a share all-cash bid for Wascana. Wascana jumped 1.10 to 20.45 on 15.8 million shares and Canadian Occidental rose 1.70 to 25.15.</p>
<p>Wascana was seeking a white knight after a hostile bid from Talisman Energy Inc. Talisman shares traded flat at 43.60.</p>
<p>Royal Bank of Canada, the nation's largest, slipped 1.05 to 57.10 in light dealings.</p>
