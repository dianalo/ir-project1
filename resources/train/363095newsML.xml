<p>Mexican stocks pared losses in late trade to close almost flat on Friday as dealers rushed to buy stocks to close their books for the week, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the close they tried to jack some prices up before the weekend, others bought ahead of forthcoming earnings reports,&quot; a trader from the Bancomer brokerage said.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended down 0.32 point, or 0.01 percent, at 3,654.34. Volume was moderate at 78.3 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that volume was thin and the market shrugged off the rally on Wall Street.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market was listless and quite overlooked developments in New York. Dealers are waiting for Q4 earnings reports in order to reshuffle portfolios,&quot; an analyst from the Arka brokerage said.</p>
<p>In contrast to the bourse's lackluster performance, Dow industrials surged 1.22 percent to close at 6,855.80 points.</p>
<p>Traders said January inflation figures released in late trade had little effect on market sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;We already knew it would be high and it was within expectations. The important thing is to see whether it goes down next month,&quot; an analyst from the Finamex brokerage said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Dealers were apathetic, they barely took any notice of the inflation figures,&quot; a floor trader added.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico announced that consumer prices rose 2.57 percent in January, compared with 3.20 percent in December.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey MXAAP of nine financial houses in Mexico City had predicted an average figure of 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>A total of 112 stocks changed hands on the broad market scoreboard, of which 40 ended up while 39 were down.</p>
<p>Heaviest traded stock at the head of the gainers' list .PG.MX was food company Herdez, whose A shares gained 12 centavos to 3.02 pesos.  </p>
<p>Herdez B shares, meanwhile, gained 11 centavos to 3.03 pesos. Dealers noted the Bear Stearns brokerage announced during trade it had initiated coverage of the company with an attractive rating.</p>
<p>Traders noted the presence of steeltube maker Tamsa at the top of the decliners' list .PL.MX after falling 3.50 pesos to 127.50 pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;Tamsa just had to fall after climbing for several months,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
