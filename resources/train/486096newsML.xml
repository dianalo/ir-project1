<p>A sailor from the American aircraft carrier Independence underwent surgery on Thursday after both his legs were badly broken when part of a jet's landing gear collapsed during take-off, defence officials said.</p>
<p>The unidentified sailor was hurt when part of the F/A-18 Hornet's port landing gear collapsed, causing its wingtip to strike a hatch which then collapsed across his thighs, U.S. navy spokesman Commander Tim O'Leary said.</p>
<p>The jet made a successful emergency landing at an inland Australian air force base but suffered substantial damage to its undercarriage, O'Leary said in a statement.</p>
<p>The incident happened late on Wednesday during routine operations 120 nautical miles off Australia's east coast.</p>
<p>The crew member, a catapault operator, also had his right arm broken and was airlifted to a Sydney hospital. He was in a stable condition after surgery on Thursday and was expected to make a full recovery, O'Leary said.</p>
<p>The Independence was part of a large U.S. naval contingent which took part in joint U.S.-Australian military exercises in and off northern Queensland state last month.</p>
