<p>Tiny Macau's mighty casinos flashed the strongest cards on Monday when three election groups from the gambling, property and entertainment sectors won the last legislative elections to be held under Portuguese rule.</p>
<p>The three groups grabbed four out of eight directly elected seats at stake in the 23-seat Legislative Assembly in Sunday's election.</p>
<p>It was the final such ballot before Lisbon hands its last Asian colonial possession back to China in 1999.</p>
<p>The traditional pro-China camp -- &quot;neighbourhood&quot; groups and a trade union -- lost ground and one of their seats slipped from their grasp. A long-time liberal legislator also lost his seat.</p>
<p>Business interests are usually friendly towards Beijing, even if not labelled pro-China, so the outcome need not cause too much of a ripple in China, political analysts said.</p>
<p>Best known for its casinos, the territory has regularly hit the headlines for vice, violence and gangland bombings.</p>
<p>More recently, the 14-day election campaign has been dogged by rumours of bribery and vote-rigging, with several complaints already due to be investigated.</p>
<p>A prominent pro-democracy activist was re-elected but two ethnic groups -- representing the Eurasian Macanese minority and Chinese from China's Fujian province -- won no seats.</p>
<p>Macau, with 424,000 people, most of whom are ethnic Chinese, is a capitalist enclave whose economy depends heavily on casino tourism. It lies on China's southern tip along the Pearl River estuary, close to British-ruled Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Like Hong Kong in mid-1997, Macau is to become an autonomous Special Administrative Region of a China that is keen to regain its lost territories and reunify by the end of the millenium.</p>
<p>But unlike Hong Kong, Macau's assembly is not fighting for its survival beyond its 1999 handover. Beijing has given Macau's elections a nod of approval, not only allowing it to straddle the handover but extending its four-year tenure to 2001.</p>
<p>The Macau vote drew a record number of 75,093 voters to the polling stations, and a turnout of 64.49 percent, the highest since direct elections were introduced in 1976.</p>
<p>The Macau Economic Promotion Association, headed by 46-year old property, entertainment and trading tycoon, Chio Ho Cheong, alias Chan Kai Kit, from China's Hainan island, finished first among the 12 groups contesting the election.</p>
<p>Two of its candidates, Chio and Liu Yuk Lun, a 52-year-old car dealer, won seats in the legislature. The group won 16.02 per cent of the votes cast.</p>
<p>The staunchly pro-Beijing Progress Promotion Union finished second among the 12 groups, polling 14.71 per cent of the votes. The group, which won 25.25 per cent in 1992, returned its two legislators, 49-year old social worker Leong Heng Teng and 43-year old business manager Kou Hoi In. They represent Macau's traditional &quot;neighbourhood&quot; interests.</p>
<p>The staunchly pro-Beijing Development Union, representing trade unions, won 14.02 per cent votes against 23.75 in 1992.</p>
<p>The group returned one of its legislators, 56-year-old school principal Tong Chi Kin, but it also lost a seat.</p>
<p>The two pro-China lists together won 28.73 per cent of the votes, as against 49 per cent in 1992.</p>
<p>Only eight seats are directly elected. Another eight are indirectly elected on nominations from functional constituencies representing business, labour, and community associations.</p>
<p>The other seven deputies are appointed by colonial governor, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, after the elections.</p>
