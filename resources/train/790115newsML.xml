<p>Tunisia's Central Bank (BCT) governor called for more thorough reforms to achieve six percent growth per year between 1997 and 2001 and to meet the requirements of economic liberalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;The ninth Plan (1997-2001) objective of achieving a new growth level of six percent per year ... calls for a reinforcement of our policy to assure coherent development of economic fundamentals,&quot; Central Bank Governor Mohamed Beji Hamda said in his annual report to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.</p>
<p>&quot;In this respect, the process of opening up to the outside world will require more thorough reform, particularly improvement of public finances, strenghtening of market mechanisms, and improvement of the business environment,&quot; he added in the report, obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The state should further reinforce its role by sending out more and more strong and appropriate signals to make all operators, internal and foreign, aware of our country's strategic orientations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Thorough and appropriately flexible reforms... will ensure the achievement of three major objectives: reduction of unemployment, reinforcement of market mechanisms and an alleviation of state indebtedness,&quot; Beji Hamda said.</p>
<p>He said that the Tunisian economy posted &quot;favourable&quot; overall results in 1996, but that attention must be drawn to some &quot;fragilities&quot;, among which he included the state's expenditures and trade exchanges.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at  6.9 percent in 1996, compared with 2.4 percent in 1995. Inflation was brought down to 3.7 percent in 1996 from 6.3 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>But the unemployment rate remained at 15.5 percent in 1996, unchanged from its level the previous year, and trade exchanges slowed down in 1996 compared to the previous years.</p>
<p>The Central Bank said domestic public debt was still high.</p>
<p>&quot;(Total state) indebtedness was brought down to 54.5 percent of GDP in 1996, but nonetheless remains high and requires that we seek solutions which might, in particular, reside in rationalisation of budget expenditures,&quot; Beji Hamda said.</p>
<p>&quot;Accomplishment of the privatisation programme within a reasonable time frame is certainly one means of alleviating these expenditures, and will provide an opportunity to reduce the public debt,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Total state indebtedness was cut to 54.5 percent in 1996 from 58.7 percent of 1995. But budget deficit excluding debt redemption was 4.0 percent of GDP in 1996, higher than a 2.0 percent forecast.</p>
<p>Domestic resources to finance the budget deficit grew by 57.5 percent in 1996 compared to their level in 1995, while the government cut the need for external financial resources by 9.4 percent in 1996 compared to 1995.</p>
<p>As a result, the rate of external debt fell to 51.4 percent from 53.7 percent and debt service ratio to current foreign currencies revenues to 16.7 percent from 17.4 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The current (foreign) debt outstanding, over 70 percent of which is accounted by a long-term borrowings, augurs well for a satisfactory development of our external position during the ninth plan (1997-2001) Beji Hamda said.</p>
<p>He said that the Central Bank had achieved stability in the real dinar exchange rate, and now intended to concentrate more on modernising the financial system.</p>
<p>&quot;The Central Bank...now intends to concentrate more on modernising the financial system so as to strenghten its equilibrium and its capabilities in resource mobilisation, containment of costs, and improvement of service quality,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The completion of the relevant programme before the year 2001 will enable the banking system to face the international deadlines for liberalisation stipulated in the General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS),&quot; he added. Tunis newsroom, 2161-787538</p>
