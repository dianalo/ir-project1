<text>
<p>Philippines President Fidel Ramos was to undergo a series of medical tests on Monday to determine if he needs heart surgery, the presidential palace said.</p>
<p>Ramos, who was admitted to hospital on Sunday, was not in critical condition, a palace statement said. It said the results of the tests would be known by 9 a.m. (0100 GMT).  </p>
<p>&quot;As of now, we cannot confirm yet if the president will have to undergo surgery because he is still being examined,&quot; Press Secretary Hector Villanueva said in the statement.</p>
<p>Doctors said on Sunday that Ramos, 68, was admitted to hospital for follow-up checks after he was confined to bed earlier this month for treatment of a throat infection.</p>
<p>But television reports said he was to undergo an angiography test to check on suspected blockages in an artery and could require surgery.</p>
<p>Angiography is an X-ray test which uses an injected opaque dye to show up blocked arteries.</p>
