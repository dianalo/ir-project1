<headline>LME metals lower still in late PM, led by copper.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Base metal prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) extended earlier losses in late evening inter-office trade, pushed lower by losses in the flagship copper contract.</p>
<p>Three month copper futures ere indicated at $1,880/85 a tonne by 1820 GMT, below the psychological $1,900 support level and well down on Wednesday's afternoon kerb close of $1,915.</p>
<p>Traders said fund and trade selling in New York helped drag LME prices lower. Bearish sentiment could see the market as low as $1,800 soon, some dealers said.</p>
<p>Other metals also fell.</p>
<p>Zinc was approaching the psychological $1,000 barrier. It was last quoted at $1,000/05 from $1,009 at the afternoon close.</p>
<p>A break below support at $997 would see the market at its lowest level for nearly eleven months.</p>
<p>Aluminium was also little changed from an earlier two-year low of $1,437 at $1,435/40.</p>
<p>Nickel and tin were showing small falls from the kerb close. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 8057</p>
