<title>UK: UK sidesteps EC warning on BA/American.</title>
<headline>UK sidesteps EC warning on BA/American.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain declined to comment on Monday on a warning by EC Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert not to clash with the Commission in ruling on British Airways' planned alliance with American Airlines.</p>
<p>According to EC sources Van Miert said in a letter sent last Friday to British trade minister Ian Lang's department that the Commission would not tolerate British approval of the deal if it conflicted with the EC's own views.</p>
<p>He warned the Commmission would defend its view in the European Court of Justice if necessary.</p>
<p>Lang's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said it could not comment as it had not yet seen the letter and because Britain had not yet ruled on the BA and American deal.</p>
<p>Lang had asked rival airlines and any other interested parties to comment on his proposals for approving the deal to Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) by last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The DTI has not received that letter,&quot; a government official said. &quot;Had we received it we could not comment on the contents because obviously we are in a situation of wait-and-see,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Director General of the OFT now has had responses and is considering them and then will send advice to Secretary of State Lang. &quot;So obviously it's premature to speculate on any eventual outcome or any possible court action by the EC.&quot;</p>
<p>Lang proposed in December conditions for allowing the alliance to go ahead, including a demand that the companies release a total of 168 weekly runway slots at London Heathrow to make room for more competition.</p>
<p>But according to one EU source Van Miert said in his letter 168 slots would not be enough to ensure adequate competition: the EC would want a figure nearer 300-400 and these slots would have to be surrendered, not sold.</p>
<p>The EC is conducting its own investigation but does not expect to give a ruling before April, which prompted industry speculation that a showdown between Britain and the EC over who has final say over the alliance may prove unavoidable.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling is that they (Britain and the EC) are running into a potential conflict,&quot; said one airline executive.</p>
<p>&quot;The OFT has done a competition analysis under EU law but what the EC appears to be saying is &quot;never mind that, we have got our own investigation into this deal'.&quot;</p>
<p>Lang declared last July that Britain would examine the proposed alliance not only under British competition rules but also under the authority of Article 88 of the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p>The move followed an announcement by the Commission that month that it was launching its own investigation into both the BA and American deal and five other transatlantic airline alliances under Article 89.</p>
<p>Article 88 provides for Member States of the EU to check commercial agreements for compliance with EU competition law whereas Article 89 provides for investigation by the Commission and for enforcement &quot;in cooperation with Member States.&quot;</p>
<p>The UK government subsequently said it regarded the Commission investigation as subsidiary to the work of the British competition authorities.</p>
<p>Last Friday the DTI also said it did not agree with Van Miert's view that European Union rules prevent airlines selling take-off and landing slots at overcrowded airports such as London Heathrow.</p>
