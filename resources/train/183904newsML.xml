<p>The European Union on Tuesday offered a wide-ranging opening its telecommunications market in a concerted bid with the United States to clinch a World Trade Organisation pact by next February.</p>
<p>The EU offer, tabled at high-level negotiations in Geneva on a global deal, was expected to be followed by new proposals from Washington, which in April this year baulked at joining a WTO deal because it felt other trade powers were holding back.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to create momentum in the negotiations, and hope our other partners will join us in tabling improved offers,&quot; senior EU services negotiator Karl-Fredrik Falkenberg told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said he hoped countries at the two-year-old WTO's first ministerial meeting in Singapore next month would agree on some &quot;robust language&quot; of commitment to the February 15 deadline.</p>
<p>A WTO pact would mean signatory powers were bound by rules reinforced through a dispute settlement procedure providing for adjudication in disagreements and rulings effectively obliging countries found in violation of the accord to shape up.</p>
<p>Under the new EU package Spain, whose former Socialist government had been reluctant to open up its domestic telecoms market to foreign competition before the year 2003, will now liberalise from January 1 1998.</p>
<p>The earlier hard-line stand from the Spanish, whose telecoms sector is regarded as potentially one of Europe's most lucrative, had been cited by U.S. officials as a major defect in the EU offer tabled in previous WTO talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this is now completing the opening for the European Community for major markets,&quot; Falkenberg said. Ireland would not fully liberalise until the year 2000, and Greece and Portugal until 2003, but these were &quot;marginal&quot; telecom markets.</p>
<p>The Brussels move followed talks between the two top trade powers in Chicago at the weekend, and Falkenberg said the EU was acting &quot;in a coordinated way&quot; with the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang told envoys from the 125 WTO member countries on Monday Washington would be improving its earlier offer by, among other innovations, opening local exchange markets to foreign trade and investment.</p>
<p>After 18 months of negotiations, the some 50 countries involved failed in April to meet a deadline to shape a pact in the rapidly growing sector after U.S. officials said a &quot;critical mass&quot; of offers had not been reached.</p>
<p>The EU -- together with the other two top trade powers, Canada and Japan -- had been ready to make a deal on the basis of packages put up at that time, including by the emerging economies from whom the United States wanted more.</p>
<p>Under the new EU offer, previous foreign investment restrictions in Spain and Belgium and indirect restrictions in the telecoms sector in France were withdrawn, and all limits on provision of foreign satellite services were dropped.</p>
<p>Liberalisation of mobile telephone services in all 15 EU states was brought forward to 1998, with what Falkenberg said were &quot;minor regulatory provisions&quot; for Ireland and Portugal.</p>
<p>But Falkenberg said the offer was conditional on getting significant improvements from other WTO members in the talks. The EU wanted better terms from Canada and Japan as well as from developing countries like Singapore, Korea and Brazil.</p>
<p>He told the news conference Brussels wanted the United States to end restrictions on submarine cable landing and commit itself to giving equal -- or MFN most-favoured-nation -- treatment to all trade partners in all telecom services.</p>
<p>The EU wanted withdrawal of Canadian foreign investment restrictions and sought MFN commitments also from Japan. It wanted elimination of foreign investment restrictions in Singapore, South Korea and Mexico and liberalisation of all telecoms services in Brazil by 1998.</p>
