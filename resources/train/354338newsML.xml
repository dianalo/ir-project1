<p>Led by corn, U.S. feed (coarse) grain output will rise modestly this year, weather a price dip in 1998/99 and then enjoy rapid growth and strong prices through 2006, the U.S. Feed Grains Council said Tuesday.</p>
<p>It forecast a corn crop of 9.490 billion bushels this year. Soybeans were pegged at 2.382 billion bushels, wheat at 2.449 billion bushels, sorghum at 610 million bushels, barley at 377 million bushels and oats at 168 million.</p>
<p>The cotton harvest would be 17.36 million bales.</p>
<p>The upbeat forecast was prepared by the council's staff, Sparks Companies Inc and the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the U.S. economic outlook continues to be clearly positive for agriculture and agribusiness over the decade,&quot; the forecast said. &quot;Continued worldwide economic growth will stimulate commodity and food demand.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, there are no appreciable factors placing upward pressure on U.S. production costs, implying an increasingly competitive sector facing very strong overseas markets with less and less disruption from governments.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the forecast, U.S. corn acreage will rise 1.1 percent, to 80.7 million acres (30 million hectares) this year and output by 2.4 percent. Exports would leap seven percent to 2.092 billion bushels or 52.88 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;This implies a modest 8.3 million tonne, or 32.8-percent, increase in stocks and a season average price of about $2.45 per bushel, a level exceeded only twice since 1984,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The average corn price for 1996/97 would be $2.74.</p>
<p>Like other analysts, the writers of the report said corn and feed grain area would expand at the expense of soybeans, wheat, cotton and rice in the long term.</p>
<p>The outlook through 2005/06 &quot;is for a rapidly growing subsector that adjusts quickly to the severe price shocks of 1995/96,&quot; the forecast said, crediting strong markets for grains and for high-value meats, milk and egg products.</p>
<p>U.S. feed (coarse) grain area would grow to 43.3 million hectares or 107.8 million acres by decade's end. Wheat, soybeans, cotton and rice would fall by the same amount.</p>
<p>Feed grain output was estimated to rise by 1.5 percent annually. Corn area and output would benefit the most, up nearly 1.7 million hectares or 4.3 million acres and production by 42.8 million tonnes or 1.69 billion bushels.</p>
<p>For 1997/98, corn would be spurred by rapid growth in domestic and export demand. The climb in meat exports can be viewed as disguised grain exports, the forecast said. If meat exports continue their rapid climb, by 2005 they would be equivalent of exporting an additional 18.2 million tonnes of feed grains.</p>
<p>Some key uncertainties could change the outcome, the forecast said. International tensions could derail grain and meat exports or economic woes could hobble them. The biggest threat to strong growth was the question of access to China's market. U.S. officials want China to expand market openings.</p>
<p>The forecast projected that Conservation Reserve acreage would drop to 28.7 million acres in 1998/99 from its current 36.4 million acres. It would rebound to nearly 32 million by 2005. Its feed grain area, now 10.4 million acres, would fall to 9.3 million during the decade.</p>
<p>The world market for feed grains was projected to increase by 124.2 million tonnes, or 1.5 percent, each year through 2005. Stocks would climb slightly and exports strongly.</p>
<p>Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan, the second-, third-, and fourth-biggest grain importers, would greatly increase imports. Japan, the number one market, would plateau at current levels and buy finished foods, it said.</p>
