<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday ordered police to close four Palestinian Authority offices in Arab East Jerusalem, his office said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Israeli leader confirmed an Israel Television report that Netanyahu had ordered the move, which coincides with a visit to Washington by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, but declined to say which offices would be shut.  </p>
<p>Under Israel-PLO peace deals, the Palestinian Authority in charge of parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip cannot operate in Arab East Jerusalem, whose final status is to be set in future peace talks.</p>
<p>The television said Netanyahu told Police Minister Avigdor Kahalani to have police issue closure orders on Wednesday against four Palestinian Authority offices on the recommendation of the prime minister's Adviser on Terrorism Meir Dagan.</p>
<p>In addition, the report said, Netanyahu instructed Kahalani to &quot;remove by the end of the week Palestinian security men operating in Jerusalem&quot;.</p>
<p>There was no immediate Palestinian comment but the moves are certain to anger the PLO at a time of high tensions following Israel's decision last week to build 6,500 new Jewish homes in East Jerusalem.</p>
