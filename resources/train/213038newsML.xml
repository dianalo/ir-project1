<p>Egypt said on Sunday Israel's resumption and expansion of settlement activity in occupied Arab land was a violation of international law and the principles of Middle East peace.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also called on the United Nations, United States, Russia and the European Union to take up their roles as protectors of the peace process to stop Israeli measures that hinder the negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel's resumption and intensification of settlement activity in the West Bank, Jerusalem and on the Golan Heights is a clear violation of international law and the principles of the Middle East peace process,&quot; Moussa said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel once again is striving to create a fait accompli in the occupied territories, to break the principle of land for peace and to scatter Arab rights to these territories,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enraged Palestinians when he lifted a four-year freeze on Jewish settlement construction in occupied lands shortly after he took office in June.</p>
<p>Israel's Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai reportedly approved plans last week for the huge expansion of a settlement in the West Bank. On Friday, Israeli officials said the Jewish state had taken the first step towards building 900 new housing units for Jews on the occupied Golan Heights.</p>
<p>Moussa warned Israel such policies and practices &quot;pose extremely dangerous and serious questions on the true intentions of the current Israeli government and would reflect its lack of commitment to the peace process&quot;.</p>
<p>Egypt, which hosted the first pan-Arab summit in six years in Cairo in June, was also considering what steps to take in the face of Israel's settlement policy, Moussa said.</p>
<p>Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel.</p>
