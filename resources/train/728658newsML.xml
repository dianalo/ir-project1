<headline>UK reviews export checks after meat plants closed.</headline>

<p>Britain's Labour government is closely examining controls implemented by the previous Conservative administration to prevent violations of the European Union's ban on British beef exports, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The move followed the closure of two meat plants in Britain on Monday on suspicion they were involved in breaking the worldwide ban on exports of British beef.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the European Commission said 1,600 tonnes of beef had apparently been smuggled out of Britain and sold to EU countries and nations outside the bloc, including Russia.</p>
<p>Cook, who has had to field questions from Russian journalists about the affair on both days of his Moscow visit, said the government in London took the smuggling allegations very seriously.</p>
<p>Cook said a Belgian company was apparently responsible for the smuggling but he fully accepted that the beef should not have left Britain in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;We are urgently reviewing the arrangements that were put in place by the previous Conservative government to prevent the export of beef from Britain,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not satisfied that in this case, as in so many other cases of the Conservatives' response to the beef crisis, that their measures were adequate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cook said the steps Britain had taken to eradicate mad cow disease meant its beef was now probably the safest in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, we take our international obligations seriously and until we can get agreement to lift the European ban on British exports we will make sure that we comply with it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The worldwide ban was imposed in March 1996 because of evidence that mad cow disease may be transmitted to humans through infected beef. Britain has instituted a widespread cull to remove BSE from the food chain.</p>
