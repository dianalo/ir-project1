<p>Israel approved on Wednesday the building of thousands of new Jewish homes in Arab East Jerusalem despite strong PLO opposition and warnings the project could unleash a wave of Palestinian violence.</p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told reporters a ministerial committee on Jerusalem gave the green light for the construction of 6,500 homes for Jews, with 2,500 to be built in the first stage. Another 3,000 housing units would be built for Arabs.</p>
<p>The homes will go up at Jabal Abu Ghneim, called Har Homa by Israel, a tree-covered hill taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the project as a move by Israel to alleviate a shortage of housing for Arabs and Jews in the city. Palestinians see it as an attempt to cement Israel's hold over all of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;Our vision of peace includes peaceful coexistence and harmony between Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Arabs -- and we are following on this principle in our decision today,&quot; Netanyahu told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have decided that construction within the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem is something that is exempt from the Oslo (peace) accords,&quot; he said, referring to lines drawn unilaterally by Israel and not recognised internationally.</p>
<p>Palestinians have charged Israel was trying to pre-empt a decision on the final status of Jerusalem, which is supposed to be decided in future talks that must be completed by 1999.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat called an emergency meeting of his peace negotiating team later on Wednesday to discuss the implications of the decision, an aide said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian Authority rejects this decision and does not recognise the ramifications that may come from the decision to build in Jerusalem,&quot; said Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision is a serious violation to the peace process and a major blow to the agreements,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Palestinians warned the project could touch off anti-Israeli violence in the West Bank and Gaza reminiscent of clashes that erupted in September when Israel opened a new entrance to an archaeological tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Sixty-one Arabs and 15 Israeli soldiers were killed in the violence, which almost wrecked the Israel-PLO peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;What the Israeli government is doing here at Jabal Abu Ghneim and other places...can destroy everything,&quot; said Faisal al-Husseini, the top PLO official in Jerusalem. &quot;Everything is ready for an explosion.&quot;</p>
<p>But Israeli security officials told the committee they believed the Palestinians would bottle their anger, at least until bulldozers began work, Israel Radio reported.</p>
<p>Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said he expected groundbreaking at the site in about two weeks.</p>
<p>Edward Abington, U.S. Consul General in Jerusalem, told a news conference before the Israeli decision was announced that the housing plan and other settlement activity would create a &quot;very, very volatile situation&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the United States sent messages to Israel and Arafat that &quot;we do not want to see any violence&quot; after Israel approves the project.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said anyone who resorted to violence over the project would be making a &quot;grave mistake&quot;, his spokesman said.</p>
<p>Major-General Uzi Dayan, commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, said the army had not sent reinforcements to the area but had &quot;concentrated troops in the necessary places&quot;.</p>
<p>Israeli security sources said an army plan in the event of clashes called for deploying tanks and snipers in areas of the West Bank and Gaza still under military occupation.</p>
<p>As the ministers met in Jerusalem, Israeli soldiers clashed with stone-throwing Palestinians in the West Bank village of Hizmeh where undercover Israeli troops shot dead a 54-year-old Arab during a raid on a home on Tuesday. Witnesses said no one was hurt in Wednesday's violence.</p>
