<p>Israeli dollar-linked bonds continued to rise on Sunday amid uncertainty about where the U.S. currency would finally settle against the shekel, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.16 pct to 108.19</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.19 pct at 107.71</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds: -0.02 pct to 108.77</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: +0.37 pct to 110.88</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.04 pct to 107.14</p>
<p>Volume including Makams was a high 276 million shekels, with turnover in dollar-linked bonds reaching 23 million shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;There is much uncertainty in the market mainly because of the dollar. The strong dollar affects inflation, which in turn affects interest rates,&quot; said a trader. &quot;It is difficult to know what will happen to the dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar-linked bonds continued to rise on the strong dollar. CPI-linked short bonds rose as well on fears that the strong dollar would boost inflation,&quot; the trader said. But prices of CPI-linked medium and long bonds were stable, she added.</p>
<p>The shekel plunged five percent last week to a record 3.592 against the dollar after the Israeli cabinet approved exchange rate reforms that widened the diagonal band in which the currency may trade, creating more room for a depreciation. There is no currency trading on Sunday</p>
<p>The reform was followed by an interest rate cut of 1.2 percentage points, bringing the central bank's key lending rate to 12.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar-linked bonds continued their rise,&quot; said a trader at Nesuah Trading and Investment. &quot;All things being equal I expect them to continue to rise tomorrow because the central bank said it wouldn't intervene in the forex market.&quot;</p>
<p>Leo Leiderman, director of the Bank of Israel's research department, said on Sunday the central bank preferred not to intervene in the forex market to stem a further depreciation in the shekel. He said the central bank was committed to defending the upper and lower limit of the band. But market analysts say they believe the central bank will intervene well before the shekel depreciates so far that it reaches the upper band.</p>
<p>Unlinked bonds were slightly lower on fears of rising inflation, which could cause interest rates to begin moving higher again, the Nesuah trader said.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
