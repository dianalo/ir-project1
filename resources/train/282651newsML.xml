<title>MALAYSIA: Malaysian rubber ends unchanged ahead of holiday.</title>
<headline>Malaysian rubber ends unchanged ahead of holiday.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Malaysian rubber market closed at half-day ahead of the New Year holiday, with prices ending unchanged, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was practically no trading this morning. Most dealers have already closed their books for the year,&quot; said one local dealer. The market is closed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At the close, January RSS1 buyer and SMR 20 buyer were quoted at 316 cents ($1.25) and 310 cents ($1.23) a kg respectively by the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board, both unchanged from Monday's close.  </p>
<p>Dealers said they expected prices to remain steady due to a tight supply of raw materials following seasonal rains which have reduced tapping activities at plantations.</p>
<p>They also expect a return of consumer interest after the holiday.</p>
<p>The INRO five-day moving average was 241.57 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg on Dec 30 against 241.53 on Dec 27. The daily indicator price was 241.80 versus 241.52.</p>
