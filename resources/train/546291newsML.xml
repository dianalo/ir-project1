<p>The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) saw its second consecutive record day of turnover with more than 2.1 billion rands worth of shares changing hands, dealers said.</p>
<p>A JSE spokesman confirmed that it was the biggest turnover ever, but said the bourse was still verifying the exact amount and would release a statement shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the highest for a day,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Dealers pegged the figure at around 2.17 billion rand, beating a record set on Friday of 1.506 billion rand. The JSE was closed on Monday for the Freedom Day holiday.</p>
<p>Traders said a massive deal in over 18 million NBS Holdings Ltd shares, worth a total of around 1.359 billion rand, was largely responsible for the fresh high.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be the single biggest deal ever,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>The deal was related to the sale in March by RMB Holdings of a 22.2 percent in NBS to financial services group Board of Executors Ltd  (BOE). BOE paid 1.37 billion rand or 68.35 cents a share for the stake.</p>
<p>In a separate transaction also announced in March, BOE said it would team up with the newly merged NBS and Boland Bank Holdings Ltd to create South Africa's fifth largst banking group.</p>
