<p>Riyad Bank is in talks with Saudi Arabian Airlines Corp to clear outstanding payments related to a three billion riyal loan the bank made to the state-owned carrier, a Saudi newspaper said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The management of Riyad Bank, under intense pressure from shareholders, is seeking to reach a settlement with Saudi Airlines to collect the principle and interest either in a one-time payment or to reschedule it over a specific time span,&quot; al-Eqtisadiah newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The airline had settled 116 million riyals in interest but still owes 237 million riyals in interest, the paper added.</p>
<p>Officials at Riyad Bank, the most heavily traded blue chip on the Saudi stock market last year, declined any comment.</p>
<p>Eqtisadiah said the bank apparently delayed publishing its 1996 third quarter results &quot;because it did not want to cheat shareholders by putting out a balance that does not reflect the reality&quot;.</p>
<p>Stock market players said they were surprised that Riyad Bank had not reported third quarter results, in line with Saudi legislation which demands public shareholding firms to publish them during the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Regardless of the loan issue, they should come out with a statement to their shareholders explaining the situation as 116 million riyals or 237 million riyals are peanuts for the size of the bank,&quot; said one. &quot;But it seems they are using it as a pressure tool to clear the matter with Saudi Airlines.&quot;</p>
