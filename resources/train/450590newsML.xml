<p>Mexico's talks with the International Monetary Fund over a new agreement are going well, but there is less of a rush now to wrap them up, a high-ranking IMF official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The IMF's Western Hemisphere Department director, Claudio Loser, told Reuters both parties were discussing an extended fund facility to replace the 1995 standby agreement that expired last month.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking very intensely to come to an agreement on all the policies in order to reach an extended agreement,&quot; said Loser, who is in Spain as an observer to the Inter-American Development Bank's annual meeting.</p>
<p>He said there was no target to end talks with Mexico, which this year has repaid in advance part of its IMF debt.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing is that, since the economic policies are doing very well this year, and as financing needs are relatively limited this year because the markets have been good for both Mexico and Argentina, there is less urgency,&quot; Loser added.</p>
<p>Mexico has said it would like to have IMF support for a structural reforms programme that will follow a stabilisation plan it launched in 1995 to overcome the peso crisis.</p>
<p>Mexico also wants an IMF agreement to fall back on if conditions in international capital markets turn sour.</p>
