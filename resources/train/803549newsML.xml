<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia stocks open firmer on bonds, results.</title>
<headline>Australia stocks open firmer on bonds, results.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-08-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australian stocks opened broadly higher on Friday, supported by a firmer bond market and by optimism after some strong company results on Thursday. Wall Street gave little guidance with a mere 0.17 percent gain.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't really expecting it to open this strong. There might be some offshore buying and the market has seen some strong results,&quot; one dealer said. By 10.20 a.m. (0020 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was 20.5 points higher at 2,647.9.</p>
<p>Thursday's results from financial services and construction conglomerate Lend Lease and construction and contract mining group Leighton Holdings put the stocks among the winners in Monday's early trade.</p>
<p>Lend Lease rose 48.3 cents to A$29.45 after Thursday's full-year result, showing a 15 percent higher net profit of A$322 million and lift in final dividend to 50 cents a share.</p>
<p>Leighton climbed 23 cents to A$6.35. It rose nearly six percent on Thursday after announcing a special dividend of 10 cents and 32 percent higher year net profit of A$86.24 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It was obviously an excellent result. They have strong future workload, which should keep them going for the next couple of years,&quot; one Sydney-based broker said of Leighton.</p>
<p>The banks were aided by a firmer bond market as a string of market-friendly U.S. data helped to soothe treasuries there.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is taking heart from bonds as it did yesterday,&quot; said Michael Scichlau of Daiwa Securities in Melbourne.</p>
<p>National Australia Bank gained 20.2 cents to A$19.11, while Commonwealth Bank rose another 15 to A$16.63 after Wednesday's full year net profit of A$1.08 billion and share buyback plan.</p>
<p>Gold stocks rose 1.15 percent on aveage, despite weaker gold bullion. &quot;There was some U.S. buying yesterday, and I think this continues today,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Normandy Mining firmed four cents to A$1.61 and Lihir Gold three cents to A$1.98.</p>
<p>Among the big resources companies, BHP was 20 cents firmer at A$17.42, while Rio Tinto gained 27 cents to A$21.32.</p>
<p>WMC recovered eight cents to trade at A$7.39 after losing 10 cents on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mayne Nickless climbed 21 cents or 2.6 percent to A$8.25.</p>
<p>Dealers pinned the gains to hopes that the government's decision to ease foreign shareholder restrictions on Optus Communications could pave the way for a quicker sale of Mayne's 25 percent stake in Optus.</p>
<p>&quot;It could pave the way for a trade sale and it also brings the Optus float forward, as people are talking about early next year, whereas before they were talking about late next year,&quot; said Paul Doherty, institutional dealer at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.</p>
<p>Doherty said there was talk around the market that this was worth about 40 to 50 cents to Mayne's share price.</p>
