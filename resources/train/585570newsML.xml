<p>Romania's government has lowered a proposed road tax levied to patch up the country's potholed highways after protests by opposition politicians, motorists and car makers.</p>
<p>A decree issued by the new centrist coalition late on Wednesday reduced the tax for larger vehicles. Some cars would have been assessed at an annual rate equivalent to $200, more than twice the average monthly salary.</p>
<p>A government statement said the tax was intended to complement an existing law creating a fund to upgrade roads. Data show around 70 percent of the country's 14,500-km (9,000-mile) road network is in bad need of repair.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, assessments for vehicles with engines of up to 1,500 ccs remained unchanged at the equivalent of $7 and middle-range cars were also left at the previous rate.</p>
<p>Owners of vehicles exceeding 3,200 ccs were the big winners and will now be assessed the equivalent of $85.</p>
<p>Pensioners are assessed an annual tax of $7 but ministers inserted a provision limiting each person to a single vehicle to prevent &quot;sales of convenience&quot; to avoid higher rates.</p>
<p>Motorists caught without a tax sticker will be hit with a fine 10 times their assessment.</p>
<p>Car makers and importers had denounced the original proposal, saying existing taxes had already eaten into sales and brought their industry to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>The leftist opposition submitted a censure motion to parliament but it was easily defeated. REUTER</p>
