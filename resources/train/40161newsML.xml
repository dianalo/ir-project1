<p>An influx of new investors, hoping for quick returns as political calm returns under Bangladesh's new government, has seen Dhaka stocks soar to record highs, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>The DSE all-share price index closed up 183.72 points, or 13.2 percent, at 1,574.56 on Sunday on turnover of 262 million taka -- an all-time high. The index stood at 1,249.9 points on August 1.</p>
<p>Market capitalisation rose to $2.57 billion on Sunday from $2.0 billion on August 1. It was only $452 million at the end of 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was depressed so long. Now the cloud of political uncertainty is gone,&quot; said broker Abdur Rashid.</p>
<p>&quot;The new government (of Prime Minister Sehikh Hasina who took over in June) is making efforts to beef up the economy by offering incentives. The corruption in the administration is being dealt with,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is booming every day. There is an influx of new investors.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said nearly 3,000 investors, including students and unemployed youths, had gathered in front of the small Dhaka Stock Exchange building in the Motijheel commercial district.</p>
<p>&quot;Why not? It's an honest and free-for-all business which gives you an easy way to earn a livelihood,&quot; said Mesbahul Huq, who recently started investing in the securities market.</p>
<p>Lower bank interest rates on savings and poor returns from investments in government bonds were diverting funds to the DSE, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;New investors are pouring in just like ants,&quot; said Rashid. &quot;I have stopped opening new accounts for them because I cannot cope with the rush.&quot;</p>
<p>DSE Chairman Imtiyaz Husain said stock prices were rising because of a huge inflow of savings from middle class people.</p>
<p>He said the sudden spurt in prices was partly due to rumours and speculation. &quot;But some of the shares are reaching their real values,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Some brokers were not so enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see any basis for such a continuous rise,&quot; said broker Mostaque Ahmed. &quot;This is not a healthy sign.</p>
<p>&quot;Big players are probably holding back huge number of shares to create an artificial crisis in the market.&quot;</p>
