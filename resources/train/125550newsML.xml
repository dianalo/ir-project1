<p>Foreign banks in Shanghai face significant competitive problems as the number of bank branches expands with no sign of a loosening of the restrictions placed upon them, foreign bankers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>There are currently 43 foreign banks with branches in Shanghai, and foreign banking sources said they understood six more had basically received permission to open.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which regulates the foreign banks, declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>The foreign banks are restricted to doing foreign exchange business with foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), and are still banned from the huge local currency renminbi market.</p>
<p>&quot;There are too many foreign banks chasing the same kind of business, which is how it will be as long as we can only effectively do business with the FIEs,&quot; said one European banker.</p>
<p>&quot;There are probably about 300 interesting blue-chip foreign joint ventures in Shanghai being chased by close to 50 foreign banks offering much the same kind of products -- it's a buyers' market,&quot; the banker added.</p>
<p>The PBOC Shanghai branch declined to give any information on the total assets of foreign bank branches in Shanghai, saying the information was not for public release.</p>
<p>But a Xinhua news agency report said that at the end of 1995, therer were 38 foreign banks with branches in Shanghai with total new assets of $9.032 billion.</p>
<p>The Shanghai manager for a major Japanese bank said banking competition, particularly amongst the Japanese banks, was becoming extremely fierce.</p>
<p>&quot;The business is growing, but the number of banks in the market is growing too. It is a very competitive market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The manager said business for his bank was up by something less than 10 percent this year over last year, which was higher than growth rates in other centres of east Asia but still below expectations for the China market.</p>
<p>&quot;Banking is difficult right now, there are constant announcements (from the banking authorities) closing off avenues,&quot; said a Western banker. &quot;It's a cat and mouse game to find the loopholes.&quot;</p>
<p>One Asian banker estimated that probably only a third of the foreign banks in Shanghai were making money, with most of the rest breaking even.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities said earlier this year that selected foreign banks with branches in the Pudong area of Shanghai would receive the right to do local currency business of some sort by the end of this year.</p>
<p>But foreign bankers said nothing had been heard of this promise for some time.</p>
<p>Analysts say they see little prospect of the local market being opened up to foreign banks in the near future, apparently as a result of pressure from Chinese state banks fearful of the competition.</p>
<p>Many bankers said they felt they were operating under tight restrictions from the Chinese banking authorities, but one European banker in Beijing said he felt the control was probably justified.</p>
<p>&quot;They would have a problem if they made things too loose. There are banks that would take advantage of it. Some foreign banks do things here which they wouldn't do in their home markets,&quot; he said.</p>
