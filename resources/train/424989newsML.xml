<title>UK: Soft oils close higher on European veg oil market.</title>
<headline>Soft oils close higher on European veg oil market.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Soft oils prices closed higher in active trading on the European vegetable oil market on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said one major shipper was in the market today although it was not the only buyer.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the majors came in and started to take out the smaller sellers in what seems to have been an attempt to get the market up and in doing so made one or two others jump in,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Other traders said the market was very nervous at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;No one has much confidence with the new higher prices and people are also concerned about the port strike in Brazil because at the moment we don't know what affect, if any, it will have on the shipment of soybeans,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Brazilian dockers went on strike at 1200 local (1500 GMT) in the port of Paranaugua on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the palm oil sector players were watching developments on the Malaysian market after prices weakened towards the close.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that the rumours about India and Pakistan cutting import taxes have proved unfounded the market appears to be looking at supply and demand again,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Malaysian palm oil output appears to be recovering more quickly than expected after the long holidays, against a background of slow export demand.</p>
<p>Traders in Malaysia said output is likely to start picking up as the low seasonal production period appears to be over.</p>
<p>In his last estimate Malaysian private forecaster Ivan Wong projected a fall of 21 percent in output during February, but some local traders now estimate the fall could be below 20 percent.</p>
<p>Wong is expected to release fresh estimates of February output in the next two days.</p>
<p>At the close Dutch soy oil was 1.50 guilders up after Apr traded at 105.00, May/Jul at 105.50 and 106 and Aug/Oct at 107 guilders per 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Dutch/EU rape oil finished one to 1.25 guilders higher after Aug/Oct traded at 106 and Nov/Jan at 106.75 guilders.</p>
<p>Crude palm oil cif Europe ended the session $5 down to unchanged while products were $5 to $2.50 lower.</p>
<p>Coconut oil closed with sellers $2.50 to $7.50 down after Jan/Feb traded at $785, Feb/Mar at $770, Apr/May at $752.50, $750 and $747.50 and May/Jul at $747.50 a tonne cif in mainly dealer trading.</p>
