<p>CB Commercial Real Estate Services Group Inc's chairman and chief executive, James Didion, said he expects to see immediate savings of $12 million from the merger with Koll Real Estate Services.</p>
<p>CB Commercial said Tuesday that it has essentially completed negotiations leading to a definitive agreement to merge with Koll Real Estate Services.  The execution of the definitive merger agreement is expected this week.</p>
<p>The combined company will be called CB Commercial.  </p>
<p>Under the terms, CB Commercial will exchange approximately 5.6 million shares of its common stock (as well as warrants to purchase an additional 600,000 shares at $30 per share) for all of Koll Real Estate Services.</p>
<p>The transaction, a tax-free reorganization to be accounted for as a purchase, includes equity currently valued at about $130 million, the assumption of debt of about $35 million as of March 31, 1997, and is expected to be accretive to 1997 earnings to CB Commercial shareholders, excluding the effects of a one-time integration charge expected to be in the $15 million to $18 million range.  </p>
<p>The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, still is subject to approval by shareholders of Koll and CB Commercial, as well as regulatory approvals.  Pending shareholder approval, the companies seek to complete the merger by mid-August 1997.</p>
<p>The merger does not include several other entities bearing the Koll name, including Koll Construction, Koll Real Estate Group (the development and investment company) or Koll International (resorts and recreational developments).  </p>
<p>CB Commercial had 1996 revenues of $583 million and has more than 4,000 employees.  Koll Real Estate Services had 1996 revenues of $115 million and has over 2,400 employees.  The combined firm would be a brokerage services provider, involved in commercial real estate leasing and sales, property and facilities management, mortgage banking, and investment advisory/asset management services.</p>
