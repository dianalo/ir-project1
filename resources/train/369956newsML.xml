<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-02-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss bond yields continued to dip to lows unseen since the late 1970s, with demand mainly for cash bonds with longer maturities as retail investors sought to offset the recent sharp drop in yields.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume wasn't bad, it was mostly in cash. This indicates that institutionals are still buyers. They are buying mostly long-term paper,&quot; said one Swiss-based bond trader.</p>
<p>He said investors concentrated on maturities from five years onwards. Short-term rates were also seen positive.</p>
<p>The Swiss average yield of public paper, calculated at midday, was 3.43 percent.  </p>
<p>The yield was back at lows unseen since the late 1970s. The benchmark 4-1/2 percent 10-year confederate bond now yields near 3.50 percent compared with about 4.00 percent a month ago.</p>
