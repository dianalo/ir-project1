<headline>Maxco sells Akemi unit for about $2 mln.</headline>

<p>Maxco Inc said Tuesday it sold its Akemi Inc subsidiary to a newly formed subsidiary of a French concern, AXSON North America, a Houston, Texas-based unit of privately held AXSON S.A. for about $2 million.</p>
<p>No material gain or loss will be recognized as a result of the transaction. However, Maxco said certain losses related to the discontinuance of the Akemi business would be reflected in the quarter ended December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, Maxco said it will buy about 7.4 percent of the capital stock of AXSON S.A.  </p>
<p>Following the sale of Akemi, Maxco said it expects to post net sales from continuing operations of about $70 million for its fiscal year ending March 31, 1997. On an annualized basis, Maxco's remaining businesses represent a revenue base of approximately $100 million.</p>
<p>Akemi, an Eaton Rapids, Mich.-based developer and manufacturer of proprietary polyester and epoxy compounds, posted operating losses over the past two years on modest revenues. It employs 25 people.</p>
<p>Akemi represented a nominal percentage of Maxco's assets and accounted for about 4.5 percent of Maxco's $80.2 million of consolidated net sales from continuing operations in fiscal 1996.</p>
<p>AXSON S.A., which posted worldwide revenues of about $27 million last year, was formed in October 1994 following a management buyout of Stamford, Conn.-based Hexcel Corp's European resin group.</p>
<p>Maxco's businesses include heat-treating services, polyethylene packaging and two construction supply subsidiaries. It also holds real estate investments and 20 percent of Medar Inc.</p>
