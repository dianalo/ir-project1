<p>Aon Corp, an insurance company, said Tuesday it took a special charge of $27.0 million pretax in the second quarter because of losses on highly volatile securities at Alexander &amp; Alexander Services Inc (A&amp;A), which Aon acquired in the first quarter for about $1.23 billion.</p>
<p>The charge amounted to $0.10 a share after tax.</p>
<p>Aon said it discovered that A&amp;A's investment portfolio contained certain highly volatile securities with previously unrecognized losses.</p>
<p>(Corrects to clarify discovery of volatile securities) Aon said it immediately sold these particular securities and undertook a full financial investigation. That investigation into the size and causes of all losses was conducted by Aon's auditors and has just been completed.</p>
<p>Aon said the investigation revealed that A&amp;A's portfolio included certainly highly volatile securities, which Aon claimed were incorrectly classified as high quality money market instruments. Aon alleged that these securities had been carried on A&amp;A's books at inflated values at the time of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Aon said it contacted law enforcement authorities and is cooperating with their investigations.</p>
<p>Aon said the securities in question included inverse floater tranches of collateralized mortgage obligations, a mortgage derivative product.</p>
<p>&quot;Naturally, we were disappointed to uncover the securities losses, which had apparently gone undetected at A&amp;A for several years,&quot; Patrick Ryan, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. &quot;But we should stress that Aon does not engage in the trading of highly volatile securities.&quot;</p>
<p>Aon declined to comment on whether it would pursue legal action regarding the A&amp;A acquisition.</p>
