<headline>Malaysia minister urges &quot;media war&quot; with Singapore.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-04-30</dateline>

<p>Malaysian cabinet ministers reacted angrily on Wednesday to a Singaporean newspaper report about crime in a Malaysian state, with one minister calling for a &quot;media war&quot;.</p>
<p>Ministers slammed Singapore's pro-government Straits Times, which this week ran stories saying former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew was probably justified in his remarks about violent crime in Malaysia's southern state of Johor.</p>
<p>Lee's remarks, made in a court affidavit in a libel suit against a Singapore opposition politician, sparked a major row between the neighbours separated by the Johor Strait.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on the local media to take up the challenge,&quot; International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters during a conference in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought the subject was dead...The government does not want to argue. Why not have a media war?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are lots of things the Malaysian media can write about Singapore. See what's happening in Singapore, the opposition is being killed...My advice to the Singapore media is to stop it or suffer the consequences for your country.&quot;</p>
<p>Cabinet sources said the issue was discussed at the weekly cabinet meeting chaired by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</p>
<p>Education Minister Najib Tun Razak said he thought the articles in the Straits Times were officially inspired.</p>
<p>&quot;The Singapore (Straits) Times could not have possibly written without a signal from the Singapore leadership or on (its) behest,&quot; Najib told reporters at the same conference.</p>
<p>Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob and Defence Minister Syed Hamid Albar also criticised the newspaper.</p>
<p>In a report on Tuesday, the Straits Times said it had analysed press reports of crime in Johor, where Singapore opposition politician Tang Liang Hong fled after January general elections, saying he had received death threats at home.</p>
<p>Lee, one of a dozen members of the ruling People's Action Party suing Tang for libel, said in an affidavit it was irrational to flee to Johor, a city &quot;notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings&quot;.</p>
<p>Malaysia reacted with fury to what it perceived as a major insult. Lee, in a rare move, offered an unreserved apology and later said he would have the remarks removed from the court record.</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur accepted the climbdown, but stressed that it would take time for the wound to heal.</p>
<p>The Singapore High Court agreed on Monday to delete the remarks.</p>
<p>Lee's lawyers submitted press clippings about crime in Johor to the court on Monday. Legal analysts said the clippings were probably submitted in order to protect Lee from being accused of making falsehoods in the libel suits.</p>
