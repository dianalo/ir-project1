<p>A South African man, deeply depressed by impending divorce, killed himself by detonating a firecracker in his mouth, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jacobus Kemp's body was found slumped in his light delivery vehicle outside his parents' home in the small town of Makwassie in North West province on Tuesday. His face was damaged beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Kemp, 26, was estranged from his wife and the divorce was due to be finalised soon. They have a two-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>&quot;It is believed he made use of a new kind of firecracker on the market which he put inside his mouth. Parts of the cracker have been sent for forensic tests to determine its make,&quot; police Captain Belinda Kleynhans told Reuters.</p>
<p>New brands of fireworks have flooded into South Africa, mostly from India and China. Many are packaged to look like sweets, and have long fuses aimed at encouraging their safe use.</p>
