<title>UK: Gilts skip higher, looking to consumer credit data.</title>
<headline>Gilts skip higher, looking to consumer credit data.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-29</dateline>

<p>Gilts jumped early on Tuesday, following a U.S. T-bond rally, and will look to consumer credit data to give clues to the strength of high street demand. The June gilt future opened 5/32 higher at 109-07. But with elections only two days away, even signs of consumer fragility are unlikely to propel gilts much higher. &quot;We'll be relatively nervous ahead of Thursday but most of what needed to be done before the election has been done,&quot; said Norman Beauchamp, head of derivatives at the Cooperative Bank.</p>
<p>He placed gilts in a watertight range from 108-24 -- &quot;solid support&quot; -- up to 109-17,18.  </p>
<p>M4 growth is expected to be revised down to 10.8 percent year-on-year in March, from an initial 11.2.</p>
<p>Darshini David, UK economist at HSBC Markets, said February's credit figure was boosted by buoyant clothing and footwear sales. They rose again in March but not quite as fast.</p>
<p>She said the latest figure would confirm &quot;that consumers continue to be prudent in their borrowing.&quot; A repeat of the 1980s boom was not on the cards.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers are carrying a far higher level of indebtedness than they were 10 years ago...and hence are unlikely to be anxious to take on more debt,&quot; David said.  </p>
<p>Afternoon impetus will come from the United States. March durable goods orders, due at 1230 GMT, are forecast to land unchanged while April's consumer confidence index, out 90 minutes later, is expected to edge down to 118.4 from 118.5.</p>
<p>Employment costs for the first quarter are also due and are expected to show a 0.9 percent increase. Economists said the figures are a reliable guide to labour costs, adding that a figure in excess of 1.0 percent would be bearish for T-bonds.</p>
<p>With durable goods orders notoriously erratic, they rose 1.5 percent in February, employment costs that will provide the best clue to the appropriate U.S. monetary policy stance.  </p>
<p>Further light may be shed on that at 1630 GMT when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan addresses the International Monetary Fund/World Bank spring meeting in Washington.</p>
<p>At the short end of the UK market, the June short sterling contract was one basis point higher at 93.34, pricing in a half-point interest rate rise within two months.</p>
<p>The next Chancellor of the Exchequer is tentatively due to meet Bank of England Governor Eddie George for a monetary meeting on May 7, just six days after the election.</p>
