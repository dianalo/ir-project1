<p>Qatar on Wednesday advised its citizens to exercise caution when travelling to its Gulf Arab neighbour Bahrain following the arrest there of two Qataris on spy charges.</p>
<p>The Qatari cabinet said in a statement after its weekly meeting that it had discussed the arrest of the two Qataris in Bahrain &quot;and the inhuman treatment they are receiving&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;...The cabinet urges all Qatari citizens to exercise caution when they have to visit Bahrain for fear that what the Bahraini authorities did will reoccur to other (Qatari) citizens,&quot; the statement carried by the official Qatar News Agency said.</p>
<p>Bahrain last month arrested the two, Fahad Hamad Abdullah al-Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammed Fakhri, on charges of spying for Qatar. The two countries are locked in a border dispute.</p>
<p>Qatar denied the two were spies, said the charges were fabricated and accused Bahrain of torturing al-Baker. Bahrain denied the charge and said the two were being well-treated.</p>
<p>Bahrain's State Security Court -- whose sentences cannot be appealed -- adjourned their trial to December 14. If found guilty they could be executed or face long prison terms.</p>
<p>The cabinet statement said the Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani had issued instructions that Bahrainis in Qatar should be well-treated and that their wellbeing should not be affected by the arrest of the two Qataris in Bahrain.</p>
<p>The arrest has raised tensions between the two Gulf Arab states, which are in dispute over small islands in the Gulf controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s.</p>
<p>Bahrain cited the dispute as the reason it boycotted a Gulf Arab summit which ended in Qatar on Monday. The summit agreed to form a three-nation committee to try to resolve the row.</p>
