<headline>Canada bonds close much weaker but outperform U.S..</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-03-27</dateline>

<p>Canadian bonds closed much weaker in an abbreviated session on Thursday, dropping with U.S. Treasuries on the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. data, analysts said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Canadian bonds sharply outperformed U.S. Treasuries, with the spread between Canadian and U.S. long bonds falling to its lowest level in recent history.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic story is we've had a 25-basis-point Fed tightening, and all evidence since the tightening is supporting yet another tightening in May,&quot; said Andrew Pyle, head of fixed income research with ABN AMRO Bank Canada.  </p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond fell C$0.90 to C$108.38 to yield 7.278 percent, its lowest level since January. The U.S. 30-year bond fell 1 - 8/32 to yield 7.09 percent. The spread between the two bonds narrowed to 19 basis points from 23 basis points, its lowest level so far this decade.</p>
<p>Both Canadian and U.S. bonds weakened this morning following a U.S. report that sales of existing or previously occupied homes rose 9.0 percent in February from January, well above expectations.</p>
<p>Other reports on U.S. help wanted advertising and jobless claims confirmed U.S. economic growth is robust.  </p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, the Canadian bonds have been influenced by the U.S.,&quot; said David Ebata, a Canadian market analyst with Technical Data. &quot;The U.S. market has already discounted another quarter percent by June.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned Canada's bond market outperformance may be due to thin volumes and may not be sustainable.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a pretty quiet market so I don't think you can necessarily say that those levels are going to hold. I think we'll have to see midweek of next week,&quot; said Mary Jane Yule, a fixed-income portfolio manager with Jones Heward Investment Counsel.  </p>
<p>Canadian markets will be closed tomorrow for Good Friday but trading will resume on Monday.</p>
<p>Analysts said an economic report that Canada's real gross domestic product rose 0.6 percent in January had little impact on Canadian bond prices. A Reuters survey of economists had forecast real GDP to rise 0.4 percent in January.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada's 7.0 percent bond due 2006 fell C$0.57 to C$102.25 to yield 6.678 percent. The U.S. bond fell 28/32 to yield 6.91 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds widened to 23 basis points from from 18 basis points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 3.18 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.37 percent.</p>
