<p>A proposed limited amnesty for combatants on both sides of Guatemala's 36-year civil war is expected to become law on Wednesday, an official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The legislators agreed to dispense with a second debate and to pass directly to third debate and final wording and to discuss possible modifications tomorrow,&quot; a spokesman for Congressional President Carlos Garcia Regas said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The amnesty has been proposed as part of a peace agreement ending the war, but human rights activists have protested against the bill, saying it could let people responsible for politically motivated assassinations and kidnappings go unpunished.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the Alliance Against Impunity, a group of prominent human rights leaders, released a statement asking Congress to make the law more specific.</p>
<p>Rights activists are concerned because the law does not specifically exclude kidnapping and murder among the common crimes to be amnestied. They fear army officers accused of ordering the murder of opponents and intellectuals will never stand trial.</p>
<p>The alliance said the law should explicitly deny amnesty to anyone who participated in crimes such as forced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, torture and false imprisonment.</p>
<p>In Madrid last week, Guatemalan government negotiators and guerrilla representatives signed an agreement that defined the terms for an amnesty for guerrilla fighters and military personnel who committed crimes connected with the civil war.</p>
<p>The accord was the last of 11 agreements leading up to a definitive peace treaty scheduled to be signed in Guatemala City on Dec. 29, ending Central America's longest civil war.</p>
<p>In the accord signed in Madrid, the government promised to present to Congress a bill to make the amnesty terms law. The executive branch wrote the bill over the weekend and presented it to Congress on Monday.</p>
<p>Under the terms outlined in the accord and the proposed law, guerrilla fighters would not be prosecuted for political crimes, such as rebellion and sedition.</p>
<p>In addition, guerrillas and army personnel would both receive amnesty for common crimes -- such as threats, arson and falsification of documents -- as long as they were clearly connected to the armed struggle.</p>
<p>The amnesty law also contains a clause excluding from amnesty crimes against humanity, but it does not specify what those are.</p>
