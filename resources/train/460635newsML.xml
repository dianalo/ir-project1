<p>It has been billed as the year of independent film makers, with only one movie by a major studio -- &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; -- nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award.</p>
<p>But in a town that made its name trading on illusions, all is not always as it appears, and that goes for the so-called independent studios.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question we have a number of quirky films nominated this year but most of them have the full benefit of the major studios,&quot; said Christopher Dixon, an entertainment industry analyst for PaineWebber in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;To suggest 'The English Patient' is a low-budget film is not the case,&quot; he said, referring to the nominally independent film that led this year's Oscar nominations with 12.</p>
<p>Of the five Best Picture nominees, only Tom Cruise's &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; was made by a big studio -- Sony. The others are from so-called independents such as Miramax (&quot;The English Patient&quot;), Gramercy (&quot;Fargo&quot;), October Films (&quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot;) and Fine Line (&quot;Shine&quot;). But that is a Hollywood fiction since most independents are actually owned or controlled by the major studios.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the only true 'indie' out there is October,&quot; said Amir Malin, co-managing executive of the privately owned studio whose only previous Oscar nomination was in the Documentary Feature category for &quot;The War Room&quot; about Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't talk about films like 'The English Patient' which was financed by Disney or the pickup of 'Shine' which was financed by Time Warner and call them independent films,&quot; Malin told Daily Variety.</p>
<p>Dixon agreed. &quot;Today there is no question the role of the independent studios has significantly changed. Look at the extraordinary strength of Miramax, which is owned by Disney, or New Line, which is Time Warner,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;They now have the marketing muscle that comes with a major studio.&quot;</p>
<p>It is hardly new that independent films receive Academy Award acclaim. William Hurt won the Best Actor Oscar in 1985 for &quot;Kiss of the Spiderwoman&quot; made by H.B. Filmes/Sugarloaf Films and Island Alive. That same year the Best Actress award went to Geraldine Page for &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; which was also made by Island. And in 1989 Daniel Day-Lewis won the Best Actor Oscar and Brenda Fricker the Best Supporting Actress for Miramax's &quot;My Left Foot&quot;.</p>
<p>But the definition of an independent film company is fuzzier now, since many smaller art-house companies are owned by big studios. Disney owns Miramax Pictures, which received 20 Oscar nominations this year for &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Sling Blade&quot;. Twentieth Century Fox has Fox Searchlight, Sony created Sony Classics and Warner Bros. owns Fine Line Features, whose &quot;Shine&quot; garnered seven nominations.</p>
<p>Other big studios like Universal and Paramount are seeking to acquire their own &quot;independent&quot; divisions and both have reportedly shown interest in acquiring October, which received six major Oscar nominations -- five for &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; and one for &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;.</p>
<p>But the big studios are not too worried about losing out to the art-house movies at Oscar time. Last year's box-office blockbusters fizzled when it came to nominations -- only five of the top-ten grossing films in North America garnered any nominations -- &quot;Twister&quot;, &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, &quot;The Birdcage&quot; &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot;.</p>
<p>But they still made money, and in Hollywood that is what really matters. Dixon said there was no reason the major studios cannot keep making these blockbusters alongside the more artistic films of the &quot;independents.&quot;</p>
<p>The difference boils down to marketing, said Tom Pollock, chairman of the American Film Institute's board of trustees.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal, of course, is to make money while making great films but if you have a choice between making money and making great films it's 'Show me the money!'&quot; Pollock, the former head of Universal Pictures, told the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>&quot;Studios don't choose to make bad films but they have a much better feeling about what they can market than about what's really good,&quot; he said. &quot;The kind of film we're talking about has to be good to work. The bad version of ('One Flew Over the) Cuckoo's Nest' nobody goes to see. The bad version of 'Twister' sells because you can market the concept.&quot;</p>
<p>If there is any truth in precedents &quot;The English Patient&quot; has a good chance of being voted best picture this year. In the last 25 years, the film with the most nominations has won the best picture Oscar 21 times.</p>
