<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top deputy Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Monday the widespread public impression of a political logjam in Bonn was wrong even if tax reform talks had failed.</p>
<p>Schaeuble, leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) parliamentary group, said he welcomed a warning from President Roman Herzog, who criticised legislators for failing to tackle overdue reforms of tax, pension and labour laws.</p>
<p>But Schaeuble said the centre-right government had made important breakthroughs with its efforts to stimulate the economy since embarking on a reform drive over a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an impression we have run into a logjam,&quot; Schaeuble told a news conference. &quot;That impression is wrong. We have accomplished a tremendous amount since January 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>Herzog, whose largely ceremonial office is above partisan wrangling, scolded the whole political class in a hard-hitting speech on Saturday. But most of Germany's political parties said he wasn't talking about them.</p>
<p>&quot;The President's speech was excellent and welcome,&quot; said Schaeuble. &quot;But he wasn't only addressing politicians, he was also talking about lobbyists.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Glos, leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), said: &quot;His warning doesn't really affect us.&quot;</p>
<p>Wolfgang Gerhardt, leader of the centrist Free Democrats who share power with the conservatives, said the FDP was the only party that was interested in reform.</p>
<p>Talks between the government and the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition on reforming the tax system collapsed last week in a rush of mutual accusations that looked very much like the start of the campaign for the October 1998 election.</p>
<p>Schaeuble said that despite the blockade by the SPD, which controls the upper house, the government had passed new laws liberalising shop opening hours, limiting sick pay benefits and making it easier to lay off workers in smaller companies.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reform logjam,&quot; Schaeuble said before scolding a journalist for suggesting there was.</p>
<p>He also blasted the SPD for changing its position on tax, saying: &quot;The SPD changes its opinion on taxes as much as some other people change their underwear.&quot;</p>
<p>Amid the flurry of finger-pointing, Germans were debating whether Kohl's government can bring about the reforms needed for EMU and the globalised economy as opinion polls showed public confidence flagging.</p>
<p>Kurt Biedenkopf, one of Kohl's longest-standing rivals in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), got personal by calling the chancellor's plan to run for reelection next year a risk for the party and calling for a primary to pick a candidate.</p>
<p>Education and Research Minister Juergen Ruettgers defended Bonn's record so far but admitted the country, with record unemployment over four million, had fallen behind its competitors in creating new jobs.</p>
<p>Herzog, whose speech was widely reprinted in the press, said Germany had to stop moaning about its problems and foster a culture of flexibility and self-reliance.</p>
<p>&quot;We are letting ourselves behave as if we had all the time in the world for change. Whether it's taxes, pensions, health, education or (European) monetary union, all you hear are the voices of the lobby groups and the doubters,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I warn all concerned against delaying or thwarting any of these reforms for tactical reasons. We cannot afford to have our political institutions blockading themselves.&quot;</p>
