<p>Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko went for a boat trip near the mouth of the mighty Amazon River on Sunday on the first full day of a two-week official visit to Brazil and Argentina, an official said.</p>
<p>The imperial couple, accompanied by about 70 Japanese and Brazilian officials and journalists, spent the morning cruising on the Guama River which flows into the Amazon at Belem, a colonial city that once flourished as a rubber centre.</p>
<p>&quot;The emperor was very impressed by the power of nature in the area,&quot; said Shimizu Shinichi, a member of the Japanese delegation accompanying the first visit to Latin America by a Japanese emperor.</p>
<p>Akihito and Michiko were due to lunch with the governor of Para state, Almir Gabriel, before meeting members of the local Japanese community in a 19th-century theatre in Belem.</p>
<p>About 100,000 descendants of Japanese immigrants live in Para. In the 1950s, they set up successful black pepper farms in the jungle region. Those farms have recently been producing a wide range of tropical fruits which are exported worldwide.</p>
<p>The imperial couple was due to fly to the capital Brasilia on Monday for an audience with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.</p>
<p>&quot;(The emperor's) visit is unquestionable proof of Japan's appreciation and friendship and eloquently illustrates the excellent relations between our counties,&quot; Cardoso wrote in an article published in the newspaper Correio Braziliense.</p>
<p>Akihito and Michiko will also visit the cities of Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro and will meet representatives of local Japanese communities in each place.</p>
<p>Immigrants from Japan began arriving in Brazil at the turn of the century, attracted by the country's coffee and agricultural boom. Now numbering about 1.3 million, they represent the biggest overseas Japanese community.</p>
<p>About 200,000 Brazilians of Japanese descent are currently working in Japan and the money they send home represents an appreciable source of income for the South American country.</p>
<p>In addition to their historic ties Brazil and Japan are important trade partners with $6.5 billion in business done between the two countries in 1995. Japan also provides Brazil with technical and financial assistance for agricultural, energy and environmental projects.</p>
<p>The emperor and empress were due to fly to Buenos Aires on June 9 for a three-day visit to Argentina.</p>
<p>Throughout their trip, the emperor and empress will be protected by Japanese police rather than the imperial guards normally used on foreign visits. The measure was seen as a sign of security concerns in Japan after the four-month hostage drama at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Peru.</p>
<p>Brazilian newspaper O Globo also reported on Sunday 60 Japanese anti-terrorist police arrived in Brazil in April and May, posing as tourists and businessmen but with the aim of discovering any possible attack plan against the imperial couple.</p>
