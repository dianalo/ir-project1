<p>Financial Review</p>
<p>Revenues in the third quarter of 1996 declined to $3,662,442 from $4,153,129 in the second quarter and $4,810,009 in the third quarter of 1995. The major factors contributing to the decline over the previous quarter were:</p>
<p>the sale of New IHS LLC (IHS) to Stef International Corp. (Stef) in August 1996 and the subsequent exclusion of DRAXIS' portion of that company's revenues from DRAXIS' revenues; certain non-recurring commission rate adjustments booked in the second quarter; and an unusual amount of product returns during the third quarter stemming from the genericization of Eldepryl(R) in 1995.  The decline was partially offset by sales of products acquired from Tican Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</p>
<p>(Tican) in July 1996.</p>
<p>The net loss for the third quarter increased to $1,537,813, or $0.07 per share, from $1,166,494, or $0.06 per share, in the second quarter and compares to net income of $311,687, or $0.02 per share, recorded in the third quarter of 1995.  As compared to the second quarter, the decline in net income is attributable to continued high level of expenditures associated with product launches, certain tax adjustments booked in the second quarter and the lower level of sales described above, partially offset by a decrease in the Company's share of equity losses from affiliated companies.  Third quarter earnings per share were virtually unchanged from the previous quarter despite the increased losses as a result of the increased number of shares outstanding during the third quarter arising from the common share financing completed in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 1996, aggregated $27,495,559 which represents a decline of approximately $3,000,000 over the previous quarter-end.  This decline is attributable to:  the operating losses experienced during the quarter; the purchase of Tican; transaction costs associated with the proposed share exchange offer; and the Company's investment in Stef.  The Company follows a policy of investing its surplus cash resources in high quality, liquid, short term commercial paper and government treasury bills.</p>
<p>Canadian Operations</p>
<p>Veterinary Products</p>
<p>Anipryl(R), a veterinary pharmaceutical product, was launched in Canada in April of this year and the activities associated with this product introduction continued into the third quarter.  Market research has indicated that while the number of dogs being treated with Anipryl is, to date, below management's expectations, the product has already achieved widespread recognition among veterinarians and its efficacy in clinical use has been extremely positive. Canadian regulatory approval was recently received for a convenient 30 day blister package and 10 mg and 30 mg dosages of Anipryl which complement the originally approved 2, 5 and 15 mg sizes.  Initial Anipryl revenues were impacted by the issuance of free samples as part of the product's introduction.  With the Anipryl sampling program now complete and the recent regulatory approvals obtained, it is anticipated that sales of Anipryl will continue to trend upwards.</p>
<p>In May 1996, Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc. (DAHI) (OTC-BB: DAHI; Toronto Stock Exchange: DAH) filed for Canadian regulatory approval to market Anipryl, to treat canine cognitive dysfunction, an Alzheimer's-like disease in geriatric dogs.  The disorder, also known as senility or old dog's syndrome, afflicts approximately 150,000 dogs in Canada each year.</p>
<p>Neurology Products</p>
<p>Sales of Eldepryl in the third quarter were affected by product returns stemming from the genericization of Eldepryl in 1995.  Sales of Novo- Selegiline in the quarter were flat relative to the previous quarter.  Sales of Permax(R) continued to be strong during the quarter.</p>
<p>As part of the Company's ongoing commitment to the management of Parkinson's disease, DRAXIS is sponsoring a series of grand rounds in four major Canadian teaching centers by the world-renowned Parkinson's expert, Prof. Warren 0lanow.</p>
<p>On August 8, 1996, the Company filed for Canadian regulatory approval to market Modafinil in Canada for use in treating the sleep disorder, narcolepsy. Modafinil is licensed to DRAXIS for Canada by Laboratoire L. Lafon of France and is being developed in the U.S. by Cephalon, Inc.</p>
<p>Dermatology Research Division</p>
<p>In July 1996, DRAXIS broadened its dermatological product line through the acquisition of Tican, an Ontario-based dermatology company with annualized revenues of approximately $550,000 from such products as: Tiamol(TM), a fluocinonide 0.05% cream for use in the management of acute dermatosis; Canscreen(TM), a broad spectrum moisturizing SPF 30 sunscreen lotion; and a range of low potency topical corticosteroids such as Aquacort HC(TM) and Ti-U-Lac-HC(TM).  The net purchase price of $911,587 consisted of $711,587 in cash and $200,000 in DRAXIS treasury common shares.  </p>
<p>United States Operations</p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc. (DAHI)</p>
<p>In July 1996, DRAXIS announced that it will offer to acquire the shares of DAHI not already owned by DRAXIS.  Under the terms of the transaction, DRAXIS will exchange 1.35 common shares for each publicly held DAHI common share. The transaction is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and is supported by independent committees of the Boards of Directors of both companies and their financial advisors.  The proxy materials for the requisite shareholder meetings became effective with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 24, 1996, and have now been mailed to shareholders.  The DRAXIS meeting will be held in Etobicoke, Ontario on November 25, 1996, with the DAHI meeting following on November 26, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
<p>DRAXIS Podiatry U.S.</p>
<p>Revenue from the sale of Kerasal(R) to dispensing podiatrists in the U.S. increased during the quarter as did the number of enrolled podiatrists.  In the six months since its launch, Kerasal has attained high name recognition amongst all podiatrists and consumer feedback on its efficacy has been extremely positive.  During the quarter, the Company completed Phase I of Kerasal's introduction to the U.S. market by achieving 46% penetration of the approximate 4,000 dispensing podiatrists.  Phase II of Kerasal's roll-out involves the development of a retail distribution strategy to support product referrals from the over 9,000 non-dispensing podiatrists in the U.S.</p>
<p>Stef International Corp. (Stef)</p>
<p>In August 1996, Stef (Nasdaq Bulletin Board: SEFFF; CDN: STEF) acquired 100% of IHS.  The combined company will operate under the Stef International name and will initially have annualized revenues of approximately $4,000,000. IHS stakeholders received Stef common shares and convertible debt for their interest in IHS.  Coincident with the closing of this transaction, DRAXIS subscribed for an additional 1,000,000 Stef common shares and 867,667 common share purchase warrants for cash consideration of $500,000.  DRAXIS now holds approximately 30% of Stef's common shares, which would increase to 40% following conversion of all outstanding convertible debt and the exercise of outstanding warrants.  DRAXIS did not record any gain or loss on the disposition of its interest in IHS.</p>
<p>On October 5, 1996, Stef launched its new Essential SPa(TM) line of skin care products specifically developed for Stef by DRAXIS' dermatology research division.  Early sales of the Essential SPa line have been encouraging.</p>
<p>Management Appointment</p>
<p>Jim A.H. Garner was appointed as Vice-President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer during the quarter.  Immediately prior to his appointment, Mr. Garner was Director of Finance at a major Canadian steel company.  Other experience includes 10 years in the investment banking industry.  Mr. Garner holds the designations of Chartered Accountant and Chartered Business Valuator.</p>
<p>Outlook</p>
<p>Financial results for the fourth quarter of 1996 are expected to improve over the third quarter as the investments associated with the initial market introductions of Anipryl and Kerasal are now substantially complete and these products, as well as the Tican products, begin to make positive contributions.</p>
<p>The outlook for the next 12 months remains positive with the prospect of the launch of Anipryl in the U.S. and Modafinil in Canada following receipt of regulatory approvals for both drugs, combined with continued improvements from the Company's existing line of products.</p>
<p>Should the share exchange transaction involving DAHI be successful, DRAXIS will begin to fully consolidate DAHI's results which will have a material impact on the Company's reported net income as a result of expenditures associated with the U.S. introduction of Anipryl and increased amortization expense.</p>
<p>With its strong balance sheet, the Company has the flexibility to continue to pursue acquisition and licensing opportunities.</p>
<p>DRAXIS Health Inc. is an emerging Toronto-based pharmaceutical company focused on neurological, dermatological and veterinary markets in Canada and the United States.  Products currently under development include Modafinil for narcolepsy and proprietary liposomed topical products for both prescription and over-the-counter products.  DRAXIS also operates a U.S. division offering products exclusively to podiatrists.  DRAXIS holds a controlling interest in Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc. which has filed for U.S. approval of its proprietary compound Anipryl for use in canine Cushing's disease.  It also has a 30% interest in Stef International Corp., a network marketing company specializing in science-based, consumer health products.</p>
