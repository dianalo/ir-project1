<p>SUGAR - World market for January 30, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London closed lower in quiet dealings. By the close March was down $0.10 at $298.10 per tonne, while May gave up $0.60 to close at $296.90 per tonne. Raw sugar futures in New York closed mixed. Our second estimate of world sugar production 1996/97 had no discernable impact as it was more or less the same what had already been expected in October. March gained 6 points to close at 10.39 cents/lb, while May closed 2 points higher at 10.40 cents/lb. The outer months close unchanged to 2 points lower.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>BELARUS - A Reuters report quoting the statistics ministry, said that refined sugar production in 1996 rose to 225,500 tonnes from 140,000 tonnes in 1995. At the same time it was reported that the sugar beet harvest was 1.0 million tonnes in 1996 compared with 1.142 million tonnes in 1995. This suggests, that the 1996 production figure includes the refining of imported raws and that beet sugar production in 1996 was lower than in the previous year.</p>
<p>FINLAND - Sugar exports in October 1996, the first month of the 1996/97 campaign (October/September), amounted to 4,942 tonnes, raw value, sharply down from last year's 8,956 tonnes. Total exports in 1995/96 reached 49,721 tonnes compared to 6,763 tonnes in 1994/95 and 15,127 tonnes in 1993/94. The major country of destination in October 1996 was Estonia with 2,433 tonnes whites against 1,903 tonnes in October 1995.</p>
<p>THAILAND - According to industry sources sugar production in November/January 1996/97 totalled 1.208 million tonnes, raw value, sharply down from last year's figure of 2.475 million tonnes. The sharp fall is attributed to the late start of this year's campaign. However, industry sources remain optimistic that the total will be higher than last season. The country exported 4.4 million tonnes of sugar, raw value, in 1996, up from 3.678 million tonnes exported in 1995. Raw sugar exports in 1996 reached 2.843 million tonnes, down from 2.898 million tonnes exported in 1995, while white sugar exports totalled 1.462 million tonnes, up from 989,237 tonnes the previous year.

<p>SOUTH KOREA - Sugar imports in September 1996 amounted to 109,735 tonnes, raw value, up from last year's 97,351 tonnes. This brought cumulative imports in the first three quarters in 1996 (January/September) up to 1.050 million tonnes against 992,795 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Total imports in 1995 reached the record high of 1.306 million tonnes compared to 1.275 million tonnes in 1994 and 1.222 million tonnes in 1993. Major countries of origin in January/September 1996 were Thailand with 619,557 tonnes raws against 339,761 tonnes, Australia with 389,574 tonnes, down from 471,580 tonnes and Brazil with 23,842 tonnes compared to nil.
