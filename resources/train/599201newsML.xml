<p>A clutch of former communist countries in central and eastern Europe clamouring to join the European Union see the elusive goal of membership slipping further and further away, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>European Commission officials say that none of the 10 applicant countries are doing very well in meeting the terms for the start of talks on membership let alone membership itself.</p>
<p>&quot;All of them have still not done an awful lot of things, the Commission even had a worst-case scenario of not opening talks with any of them though that is a non-starter because of political support from Germany and France,&quot; said one official.</p>
<p>The Commission, which is currently putting the finishing touches to its opinion on each candidate's suitability, is committed to open talks with some aspirants six months after the end of this summer's EU treaty review.</p>
<p>Germany and France have said they would like countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to be members of the European club by the year 2002, but even the most ardent enthusiasts now believe this date is unrealistic and say the process could take up to 15 years.</p>
<p>According to some estimates, the Czech Republic is currently leading the field of countries bidding for membership with Poland, in sharp contrast to its attempt to become a member of NATO, now in fifth place.</p>
<p>The Commission has also to decide whether to open talks with all countries at the same time and then proceed on an individual basis or whether to start negotiations only with those with serious medium-term prospects of admittance.</p>
<p>Last April, the European Union told Hungary and Poland they had to make further efforts to avoid delays in meeting the minimum economic conditions to open talks.</p>
<p>The lack of steam behind EU enlargement contrasts sharply with that of the planned eastwards expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and renewed U.S. concerns over European diplomatic immobility on its own continent.</p>
<p>NATO countries are to meet in Madrid on July 8-9 to invite at least Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the West's military defence grouping with Slovenia and Romania as the most favourite possibles for a first wave of membership.</p>
<p>Washington, which has long seen membership of both organisations as twin processes integrating newly democratic states into the West, hoped the prospects of EU membership would help soothe the worries of those left out of NATO.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that, although EU membership is a more complex process, the feeling is that it has lost all drive,&quot; said one Commission insider.</p>
<p>Commission sources say the U.S. criticism coincides with an outbreak of in-fighting within the EU over whether the enlargement dossier should be left with External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek or transferred to a special &quot;task force&quot; under Commission President Jacques Santer.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people say van den Broek is simply too low profile,&quot; said one official, pointing to his much-criticised performance during the wars which accompanied the break-up of former Yugoslavia.</p>
