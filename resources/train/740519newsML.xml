<p>The following is the full text of Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya's comment on Thai interest rates during an interview with reporters in Tokyo on Friday.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Interest rates have already started to come off their highs. Do you welcome that trend and do you believe there's room for them to go further near term?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>&quot;About the exchange rate fluctuations, to our knowledge what we learned from the experts from Australia and the IMF who have been with us, that clearly if we could take the baht to its equilibrium level within one month that would be very fast.</p>
<p>So we foresee interest rates to remain high for one to two months after the...exchange rate has been stable it would be very easy to bring interest rates down.</p>
<p>Because once the outflow of capital can be stopped then we can always inject liquidity, baht liquidity.&quot;</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>&quot;What sort of level do think would be appropriate?&quot;</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to see it, again it is related to the U.S. dollar's rate and the international market rates of other currencies but in the history of Thailand if the baht (interest) rate can be brought down to about 10 (percent) that would be very sufficient for the businessmen who will be very pleased because the inflation rate at about five to six percent that means the effective rate of interest is about four to five percent only. I think that would be efficient for the market mechanism.&quot;</p>
