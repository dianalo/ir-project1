<p>Toronto stocks closed flat in light trading on Monday with its upward bias kept in check by battered Barrick Gold Corp. and the fact U.S. markets were closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index added 3.36 points to end at 6217.60. Turnover was thin at 84.8 million shares worth C$1.13 billion ($836 million).</p>
<p>Investor interest in mergers buoyed Toronto despite tumbles by closely watched Barrick and Bre-X Minerals Ltd., analysts said.</p>
<p>Both fell after Calgary, Alberta-based prospector Bre-X announced a deal with Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc., based in Louisiana, to develop a huge gold discovery in Busang, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Freeport will own 15 percent of Busang, Bre-X will keep 45 percent and Indonesian interests will take 40 percent.</p>
<p>Barrick shares sank sharply after the Toronto-based gold miner was shut out of the Busang development.</p>
<p>&quot;Barrick dragged down the gold index,&quot; said Maison Placements Canada president John Ing.</p>
<p>&quot;New York was off today, so there wasn't any action,&quot; he added. U.S. financial markets were closed on Monday for President's Day holiday.</p>
<p>Market players will keep an eye on Canada's 1997/98 federal budget due at 1630 EST/2130 GMT on Tuesday, but no major surprises are expected, traders said.</p>
<p>Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 12 groups rose led by conglomerates, media, forestry products and retail.</p>
<p>The only two weak sectors were gold and financial services.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outpaced declines 545 to 422 with 297 stocks unchanged.</p>
<p>In individual issues, Bre-X fell 0.95 to close at 23.00 on 5.1 million shares, while Barrick sank 1.90 to 34.05 on 1.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Merger mania helped keep Toronto firmer, including oilpatch takeovers.</p>
<p>Energy firm Morrison Petroleums Ltd. rose 0.15 to 10.40, topping Toronto's most active issues. Morrison and Northstar Energy Corp. unveiled a C$700 million ($518 million) merger last week. Northstar shares rose 0.15 to 14.90.</p>
