<p>European Union fisheries ministers began marathon negotiations on Thursday to fix 1997 fish catch quotas and tackle a long list of fisheries issues.</p>
<p>Ireland, presiding over the last ministerial meeting of its EU presidency which ends on December 31, was drawing up a compromise proposal after holding bilateral talks with member states during the morning.</p>
<p>It will try to balance the proposal of the European Commission, which is seeking modest cuts to protect fish stocks, with demands from ministers, under strong pressure from fishermen, for higher quotas.</p>
<p>&quot;This week's Fisheries Council will be very tough going indeed,&quot; Sean Barrett, Ireland's marine minister, said in a statement before the meeting.</p>
<p>EU officials said one of the biggest battles will be over fishing in the Baltic for cod, herring, sprat and salmon now that Sweden and Finland's membership of the EU has ended their bilateral accords with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.</p>
<p>Germany, Denmark and Finland strongly oppose the proposed re-allocation of fishing rights.</p>
<p>Another potential flashpoint is over measures to halt the decline of sardine stocks off Spain and Portugal while Italy and Greece will be fighting over new quotas for bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and Atlantic and for swordfish in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The new quotas are based on recommendations by international scientists.</p>
<p>The Commission wants to extend emergency measures introduced in July to protect critically low herring stocks and fix a total allowable catch (TAC) for 1997 of 159,000 tonnes, roughly half the 1995 level.</p>
<p>Among other issues, agreement may finally be reached on a satellite fishing vessel tracking system, officials said, but there was little chance of agreeing a new multiannual fleet and fishing reduction programme.</p>
<p>British fisheries minister Tony Baldry insisted that there would be no agreement on reducing  fleet size until the problem of &quot;quota hoppers&quot; -- mainly Spanish vessels which registered in Britain and took 20 percent of the British quota -- had been settled.</p>
<p>&quot;I've made it very clear that we will see no further reductions in UK fishing capacity or fishing effort until we've resolved this whole issue of quota-hoppers,&quot; Baldry told reporters before the meeting.</p>
<p>The issue is being dealt with by an EU intergovernmental conference reviewing the EU's treaties which is due to end work next summer. -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800</p>
