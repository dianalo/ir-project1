<p>Sweden's Annika Sorenstam made it two victories out of three on the LPGA Tour, hanging on for a one-stroke victory Saturday at the $650,000 Hawaiian Ladies Open at the Kapolei Golf Course.</p>
<p>Sorenstam captured her second victory of the year in just her third tournament, becoming the quickest multiple winner on tour since Beth Daniel won twice in the first five events of 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm amazed,&quot; she said. &quot;I have the right frame of mind. I hope this momentum continues.&quot;</p>
<p>The two-time defending U.S. Open champion posted a one-over-par 73 Saturday and survived a bogey on the 18th hole as her closest pursuers also faltered down the stretch.</p>
<p>Sorenstam, who also captured the season-opening Tournament of Champions, won with a 54-hole total of 10-under-par 206, one shot better than Meg Mallon.</p>
<p>Sorenstam has eight career victories in four years on Tour, playing in just 60 LPGA events. The $97,500 first prize padded her lead atop the 1997 money list with $273,010.</p>
<p>Mallon shot a two-under-par 70, but bogeyed the 17th and 18th holes to fall one stroke short.</p>
<p>Hall of Famer Betsy King was challenging for the lead at 11-under before a triple-bogey seven at the 18th hole dropped her to third place at eight-under 208. She carded a 69.</p>
<p>Sorenstam four-putted for a double-bogey on the first hole, stirring up memories of last week's Los Angeles Women's Championship, where she had a final-round 73 and blew a three-stroke lead.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't four-putted in a long time, I couldn't believe it,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought about last week and said, Oh, no.' Today's start was the worst in a long time. I didn't want anything to do with last week.&quot;</p>
<p>She regained her composure with back-to-back birdies at the sixth and seventh holes.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have been a downer if I lost,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The LPGA travels to Australia for next week's Australian Masters, where 1996 Rookie of the Year Karrie Webb will rejoin the tour.</p>
