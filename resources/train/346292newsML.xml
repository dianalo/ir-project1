<p>British Telecommunications Plc is expected to report surging third quarter pretax profits next Thursday, helped by domestic growth -- a trend that surprised analysts when the company posted its half-year results.</p>
<p>&quot;Our assessment...is that medium term volume trends will continue to surprise,&quot; says brokers BZW.</p>
<p>Telecoms analysts are expecting the company to report pretax profits, before exceptional items, of 860-930 million pounds from 829 million stg last time.</p>
<p>They have pencilled in earnings per share of 8.9 to 9.5 pence per shares from 8.7 pence in the same quarter last year.  </p>
<p>BZW, which is raising its inland call volume for BT by two percent to 8.8 percent in 1997/98, says it expects volumes to be driven by a combination of real price erosion and new product initiatives.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent trend of better than expected revenue per sunscriber numbers from the mobile operators is one manifestation of this trend,&quot; it notes.</p>
<p>Exceptional costs are expected to include another hefty charge for redundancies. BT said last November that it expected around 3,000 voluntary redundancies in the second half, likely to cost the firm around 230 million pounds, analysts say.  </p>
<p>BT's shares, which ended Friday 7.5 pence stronger at 428.5p, started rising steadily over the last weeks.</p>
<p>Some brokers, such as SocGen, say they could even rise to touch five pounds each on the back of BT's joint ventures, such as Cegetel in France and Viag InterKom in Germany or its planned $20 billion merger with U.S. international carrier MCI.</p>
<p>But Salomon Brothers' Andrew Harrington believes the share price is being driven by index funds that need to re-weight the stock ahead of BT's planned merger with MCI.</p>
<p>With rising competition eating into margins, Harrington believes BT's stock is worth under 400p on a fundamental basis.  </p>
<p>BT's plan to buy the 80 percent of MCI it does not already own will catapult the new group, dubbed Concert, into second place in terms market value on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>BT is currently the fifth biggest company in the All Share index, with a 2.4 percent weighting.</p>
<p>Concert, however, will have a hefty 3.8 percent weighting in the All Share index, analysts say. -- Kirstin Ridley, London Newsroom +55 171 542 7987</p>
