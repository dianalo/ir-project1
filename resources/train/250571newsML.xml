<p>Greek farmers dug in their heels after the socialist government rejected their demands, and the strike that has nearly paralysed the country's transport system for 14 days showed no sign of ending on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Greece's struggling economy could not bear the burden of satisfying the farmers, who responded by vowing to keep up the blockade.</p>
<p>&quot;Demands for billions (of drachmas) cannot be satisfied. To do so would be a step backwards,&quot; Simitis said on Tuesday after a cabinet meeting which was dominated by the farmers' protest.</p>
<p>The farmers, who have thrown up nearly 100 road blocks with a fleet of 10,000 tractors around the country, said after an emergency meeting in the central city of Larissa that his statement was a provocation and they would stay put.</p>
<p>&quot;We got no answer to any of our demands,&quot; said farmers' representative Thanassis Nasikas. &quot;After the Prime Minister's statement we will have more tractors blocking roads.&quot;</p>
<p>The farmers want lower fuel prices, higher crop subsidies and a rescheduling of $1.3 billion in debts. Simitis said there was no way he could satisfy them and keep up with Greece's European Union convergance targets.</p>
<p>Transport Minister Haris Kastanides said the cost of the blockade to the transport sector alone was over 22 billion drachmas ($90 million) and rising.</p>
<p>Government officials told Reuters Simitis was hesitant to give in to the farmers fearing other sectors objecting to this tough 1997 budget might be encouraged to stage similar action.</p>
<p>The budget, which cuts state hiring, abolishes most tax exemptions and imposes new levies, has drawn fire from a welter of industries.</p>
<p>The two biggest labour confederations have called a one-day nationwide strike for December 17 and many unions have declared a three-day stoppage at that time.</p>
<p>State doctors, teachers, public servants, customs workers and even Greek diplomats have joined in the protests, halting work, marching through Athens or staging rallies.</p>
<p>Elected to a four-year term in September and facing his first major crisis, Simitis acknowledged his tug of war with the farmers was creating &quot;huge problems in the economic life of cities&quot; but avoided saying how he was going to open the roads.</p>
<p>The farmers have shown no hint of compromise, setting up sprawling tent cities on the nation's highways.</p>
<p>Their blockades have trapped foreign lorries from Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East for days with poor water, food and sanitation.</p>
<p>&quot;The money should have been in the bank (for the trip). I'm also losing a complete journey now worth 4,000 pounds ($6,600), and I will lose the truck when I get home,&quot; British driver Bob Edwards told Reuters Television.</p>
<p>Drivers must stay with their trucks for fear of theft and have none of the roadside comforts which the farmers have been able to bring from nearby homes.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like a hostage. I also want cheaper diesel but I don't go out blocking national roads. This is a Greek thing anyway and I should not pay for it,&quot; said British trucker Alan Kendall, stranded near Larissa.</p>
<p>While the mood of the farmers is defiant, foreign truckers are despairing.</p>
<p>&quot;I was hoping to be home for Christmas with my wife and family and to see everyone but I don't know if I will,&quot; David Cooper, from Manchester, England, told Reuters Television.  REUTER  102327 GMT dec 96</p>
