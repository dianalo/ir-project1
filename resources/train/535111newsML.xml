<p>Former Prime Minister Petre Roman said on Thursday that Romania and Ukraine had narrowed differences over a treaty important to Bucharest's chances for early NATO entry.</p>
<p>Roman, now chairman of Romania's upper house of parliament and the number two state figure, said the treaty would recognise existing borders and enshrine rights for each country's ethnic minorities. Diplomatic sources say the document should be ready for initialling next month.</p>
<p>&quot;We are clearly saying we do not want a change of borders,&quot; Roman told a news conference at the headquarters of his Democratic Party, junior partners in the centrist coalition elected last year.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma also noted progress this week, saying no major obstacles remained between Kiev and Bucharest over the treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no major differences in our approach and our main principle is inviolability of borders,&quot; Kuchma said this week in Chernivtsi, the main city in northern Bucovina. The area is a former Romanian heartland annexed by Moscow under the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact and now part of souhwest Ukraine.</p>
<p>&quot;We are giving up nothing, because reality is what we have now,&quot; said Roman. &quot;Let's not forget that others, to the west, east or south, might also raise claims, which we would consider totally unfounded.&quot;</p>
<p>Romania won praise from the West for signing a treaty last year ending old rifts over borders and minorities with its western neighbour Hungary.</p>
<p>Western leaders say a similar treaty with Kiev would improve Romania's chances to be included in NATO along with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic when the alliance holds its summit meeting in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>Romania's new leaders view Ukraine's territorial integrity as important for regional security. Clinching the treaty would also help Ukraine against claims by Russian nationalists to the Black Sea port of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>Romania has dropped earlier insistence that Ukraine atone for the Soviet annexation of both Bucovina and southern Bessarabia. Remaining differences focus on delineating Black Sea borders, where both sides are drilling for gas and oil.</p>
<p>&quot;What we do want and what we are entitled to, is a status for the Romanian minority in northern Bucovina in line with European standards,&quot; Roman said. &quot;The present situation there is the result of 50 years of Russianisation.&quot;</p>
<p>Bucharest says there are about 200,000 ethnic Romanians in Ukraine. Authorities in Kiev seek similar rights for a roughly equal number of ethnic Ukrainians in northern Romania.</p>
