<headline>Soros presses WMX board nomination notice.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>A group led by financier George Soros on Thursday said its proposal to nominate four directors to the board of WMX Technologies Inc had been delivered in time to meet the filing deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;Quantum believes that the Nomination Notice was timely delivered and contained all the information required by&quot; company bylaws, the group said in a letter to WMX dated February 12 that was attached to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Soros group called for the chief executive's ouster and proposed a slate of nominees for the board of the largest U.S. garbage-hauling company.</p>
<p>WMX, however, said the nominations would not qualify for consideration at its annual meeting because they came after the filing deadline and contained incomplete information.</p>
<p>The Soros letter said that &quot;Quantum does not believe that the interests of WMX's stockholders are served by WMX's stance regarding the nomination notice and we therefore reiterate the request presented to your counsel yesterday that the WMX board of directors act immediately to waive any arguable defect with respect to the nomination notice.&quot; .</p>
<p>The Soros group owns about 5.2 percent of WMX and has been pressing the company for months to improve its performance.</p>
