<p>Popular unrest simmered across the Balkans on Thursday, fuelled by the region's failure to make the smooth transition to democracy and capitalism achieved in much of former communist eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In Bulgaria and Serbia, protesters took to the streets once again in what have become daily rituals of discontent, triggered in both countries by disputes over elections but fuelled by very different underlying grievances.</p>
<p>Impoverished Albania saw further street protests by bitter investors after the collapse of a pyramid scheme symptomatic of the predatory financial scams rife in some chaotic post-communist economies.</p>
<p>Despite tentative moves towards compromise between Sofia's ruling Socialists and an emboldened opposition which has led nationwide unrest to demand early elections, Bulgaria saw demonstrations and protest strikes for an 11th day.</p>
<p>The former communist Socialist party won power in free elections in 1994 and democratic freedoms are well established, but Bulgaria's economic performance has been catastrophic.</p>
<p>Inflation of over 300 percent, a collapsing currency and plunging living standards lie behind the protests. Life for many is likely to get even worse before it gets better, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank demand painful reforms as a condition of aid to the near-bankrupt state.</p>
<p>Thousands of students marched on Thursday to the centre of Sofia to back calls for elections by the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, who also want moves towards a restrictive monetary regime under IMF and World Bank guidance.</p>
<p>Protests were reported in schools, hospitals and on the streets of Kozloduy, a traditionally pro-Socialist northern town and home to a nuclear plant that provides more than 40 percent of Bulgaria's power.</p>
<p>The Socialist government's market reform policies exist mostly on paper alone. Opinion poll results on Thursday gave them a mere eight percent support and four leading figures on the Socialists' reform wing said they were quitting the party.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian protesters admit to taking their lead from neighbouring Serbia, where up to half a million people have demonstrated daily for almost nine weeks.</p>
<p>Despite years of international economic sanctions against Serbia for its role in the Bosnian war, incomes in Belgrade are higher than in Sofia, and the protesters there demand not bread but democracy.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Thursday urged Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to fully recognise opposition local election victories which his authorities annulled in what protesters see as blatant fraud.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders, rallying crowds showing signs of flagging after the marathon demonstrations, said there should be a deadline for the government to restore election results.</p>
<p>In the Albanian capital Tirana, police were stationed along roads leading to the main Skanderbeg Square after protests by angry investors in a failed get-rich-quick pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>More than a dozen were reported hurt and 29 arrested in clashes with riot police on Wednesday. Groups of disappointed savers gathered again on Thursday at the Tirana home of a woman arrested as the brains behind the pyramid.</p>
<p>In the southwestern city of Vlore, protesters hurled stones at the city hall on Thursday after another firm postponed resuming payments to depositors. Shkoder in the north was also reported to be tense.</p>
<p>The opposition Socialists, reformed heirs to the communists who ruled Albania as an isolated dictatorship for half a century, accuse President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party government of pushing the economy to the brink of collapse and of turning a blind eye to the murky pyramid business.</p>
<p>One independent newspaper called for the opposition to take a lead from its counterparts elsewhere in the Balkans.</p>
<p>&quot;One would have thought that the opposition would have learned a valuable lesson from the demonstrations in Belgrade and Sofia,&quot; the Koha Jone daily said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;But Berisha has learned more. Police violence has shown he will protect the city squares with fanaticism.&quot;</p>
