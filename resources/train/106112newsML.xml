<p>The chief Palestinian negotiator said on Wednesday Israel could break a deadlock on the future of Hebron by agreeing to move the 400 Israelis there to a nearby Jewish settlement.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was certain to reject the idea. The Israeli leader insists that Jews have a right to live in Hebron as the burial place of the biblical Abraham and home to the oldest Jewish community in the world.</p>
<p>The issue, ahead of a fourth day of talks, underscored differences between the two sides which U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross tried to play down. &quot;They are making a serious effort to understand each other's concerns,&quot; he insisted.</p>
<p>The talks resumed on Sunday after violence sparked by Netanyahu's opening of a Jerusalem tourist tunnel near Islam's third holiest shrine last month claimed the lives of 59 Palestinians and 15 Israelis.</p>
<p>Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said: &quot;One of the easy solutions to the security concerns of Israelis who are trying to change the Hebron agreement under the pretext of offering additional security...is to move settlers from the city centre to the nearby Kiryat Arba settlement&quot;.</p>
<p>Israel agreed to pull back from Hebron after pulling out of other West Bank towns but the redeployment has been put off for seven months because of Israeli security concerns following Palestinian suicide bombings that killed 59 people.</p>
<p>The city, a flashpoint of unrest, is home to 100,000 Arabs and 6,000 Jewish settlers -- 400 settlers in the heart of the city and the rest in Kiryat Arba.</p>
<p>Erekat said the sides were deadlocked.</p>
<p>&quot;The real problem in the negotiations is that Israel is trying to redraw the agreement to fit the settlers. Why doesn't it try to make an agreement to fit the eight million Palestinians and Israelis?&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There are also Palestinian security concerns. These settlers are responsible for all the problems and the massacres,&quot; he told the 88-member Palestinian legislative council in a reference to a Jewish settler's massacre of 29 Palestinian worshippers at al-Ibrahimi mosque in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder if any Israeli would like to have these settlers as his neighbour,&quot; Erekat told Reuters.</p>
<p>Officials said the Israeli delegation proposed security amendments to the accord that would reduce the size of the Palestinian police due to take control of parts of Hebron and insisted they be armed with pistols rather than rifles.</p>
<p>The Israelis also wanted to maintain control of parts of the city due to be transferred to the Palestinians under the agreement. The officials said the Israeli negotiators refused to put their proposals in writing.</p>
<p>An Israeli source close to the talks said: &quot;Of course nobody said it was going to be easy. What we're proposing is to operate within the boundaries of the agreement but to take into account our security considerations, which has delayed implementation of the Hebron redeployment until now.&quot;</p>
<p>PLO official Hassan Asfour said American mediators, involved in the talks, were expected to submit bridging proposals to end the deadlock.</p>
<p>In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Tuesday: &quot;The question is not whether they will redeploy. The question (is what) will be the conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;Can the Jewish population of Hebron -- and there's been a continuous -- well, there's been a population in Hebron, a Jewish population for a long, long time -- will that population be protected? And these are legitimate issues to raise.&quot;</p>
