<title>JAPAN: Tokyo precious metal futures end firmer.</title>

<p>Yen-based Tokyo precious metal futures settled firmer across the board on Tuesday, supported by firmer bullion prices, but some of the early gains were pared due to the yen's recovery late in the day, traders said.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from one yen to 11 yen per gram higher. Most-active benchmark February ended up 10 yen at 1,365 yen.</p>
<p>Activity in gold futures was lacklustre.</p>
<p>&quot;In gold futures, private investors were slightly on the buying side, encouraged by the fact that gold rebounded above $350 per ounce in New York overnight. But buying lost steam in line with the currency market,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted at $351.80/2.30 per ounce at 0745 GMT, against $351.60/2.10 in New York on Monday.</p>
<p>Bullion prices moved firmer during Asian hours, as short-covering by overseas funds overwhelmed early selling by producers, the traders said.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium futures ended higher, but prices shed some of their early gains as profit-taking and fresh selling gathered force on the yen's rebound, the traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;In palladium futures, private investors were tending to sell palladium at current levels,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Despite the continued suspension of Russian exports to Japan, Japanese traders were divided over the near-term outlook in palladium. Some said palladium has more scope to rise, while others said it is unlikely to rise sharply as higher prices have caused demand to weaken.</p>
<p>Palladium futures ranged from 10 yen to 15 yen per gram higher. Most-active benchmark February was up 13 yen at 575 yen. Platinum futures ranged from four yen to 15 yen per gram firmer, with benchmark February ending up nine at 1,460 yen.</p>
<p>Benchmark February silver was up four yen at 204.5 yen per 10 grams.--Tokyo Commodity Desk, +81-3-3432-7431</p>
