<p>The dollar rose to new two-year highs against most European currencies as supportive comments from German and U.S. officials fuelled a continuation of last week's sharp rally, dealers said.</p>
<p>A surprisingly strong U.S. December payrolls report last Friday sparked a broad-based rise in the dollar. Given Monday's derth of fresh U.S. economic data and the relatively quiet performance of stock and bond markets, the bullish dollar sentiment prevailed for a second session.</p>
<p>The dollar's current strength was supported by German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer, who said the top industrial nations, called the Group of 10, have no cause for concern about exchange rate levels within Europe or between Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Tietmeyer's comments seemed to be an endorsement about the dollar's recent rise against Europe and accelerated its gains,&quot; said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd.</p>
<p>Later in the trading session, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin soothed nervous investors about the dollar's dizzying heights by reiterating the Clinton administration's oft-stated support for a strong dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's move started last night with Tietmeyer's comments and Secretary Rubin's remark this morning certainly helped the dollar along as well,&quot; said Kevin Lawrie, global manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank.</p>
<p>Also aiding the dollar was the mark's weakness against other European currencies, especially the Norwegian crown, which pushed the mark below four crowns for the first time since September 1992.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit rose to 1.5925 marks, its highest level since August of 1994, before closing below its high at 1.5884/89 marks. The dollar opened at 1.5871/76 marks.</p>
<p>Against the Swiss franc, the dollar climbed to 1.3796, its highest level since May 1994, before ending at 1.3755/62 Swiss francs. The dollar opened higher at 1.3778/88 Swiss francs.</p>
<p>Dealers said a concerted effort was underway by market players to boost the dollar above a cluster of significant highs made in 1994 against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders are gunning to push the dollar above the 1.60 mark level, which would beat out the 1994 highs,&quot; Refco's Malpede said.</p>
<p>The dollar was little changed against the yen despite Monday's rebound in Japan's previously ailing stock market. Dealers said concern that Japanese officials might be adverse to a weaker yen muted any potential dollar rise.</p>
<p>The dollar traded in an extremely narrow range to end slightly higher at 116.45/50 yen compared to 116.33/38 at the open. The dollar was almost unchanged at Canadian $1.3470/75 from C$1.3471/76 at the open. The Australian dollar ended off at $0.7784/89 from $0.7792/97.</p>
