<p>Tribune Co Chief Financial Officer Don Grenesko said the company was comfortable with earnings projections &quot;at the low end of (analysts') estimates for both the fourth quarter and full year.&quot;</p>
<p>Grenesko, in remarks prepared for delivery at a PaineWebber media conference, said earnings estimates range from $1.08 to $1.36 on a primary per-share basis for the quarter, and from $4.12 to $4.40 for the full year.  </p>
<p>The Tribune executive also said that, assuming the economy continues stable and the company's Renaissance Communications Corp acquisition closes in early February, it expects consolidated revenue growth in 1997 to be 12 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization should grow about 20 percent, Grenesko said.</p>
<p>&quot;Without Renaissance, we expect revenue growth to be in the six to eight percent range, and EBITDA would be in the low teens,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our EBITDA has grown steadily for the past several years and should top $600 million this year,&quot; Grenesko said. &quot;We're on track to meet our goal of double-digit cash flow growth.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of 1996, debt should be just over $1.1 billion, he said. At the end of 1997, Tribune expects debt to be about $1.8 billion, for a total debt/capital ratio of just under 50 percent.</p>
<p>Grenesko said capital spending for 1996 should be slightly more than $100 million. For 1997, it is expected to be about $135 million due to digital television, color presses in Orlando, Fla., and new technology for the company's newspapers, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We also plan to reinstate our stock repurchase program in 1997 and will continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities,&quot; Grenesko said.</p>
