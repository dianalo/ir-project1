<headline>BankAtlantic to buy Oriole Homes stake.</headline>
<dateline>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>BankAtlantic Bancorp Inc. said Friday it agreed to buy a controlling stake in Oriole Homes Corp., a major real estate developer in Florida, for about $22 million.</p>
<p>BankAtlantic, the second largest financial institution based in Florida, said it will acquire the interest owned by members of the Levy family at $12 a share.</p>
<p>Oriole's class A and class B shares jumped $2.25 to $9.25 on the American Stock Exchange while BankAtlantic edged down 12.5 cents to $13.75 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Oriole, based in Delray Beach, Fla., is one of the largest builders of residential communities for active adults in South Florida. BankAtlantic, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is the holding company for BankAtlantic, which had total assets of $2.6 billion as of Dec. 31.</p>
<p>The shares to be acquired represent about 61 percent of Oriole's Class A common stock and 26 percent of Oriole's class B common stock. Upon consummation of the transaction, the members of the Levy family would resign as officers and directors of Oriole.</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to boost BankAtlantic's earnings and is expected to close within 60 days, subject to the completion of review by BankAtlantic, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition reflects our decision to diversify BankAtlantic Bancorp's sources of non-interest income and to increase non-interest income revenues,&quot; said Alan Levan, chief executive of the company.</p>
