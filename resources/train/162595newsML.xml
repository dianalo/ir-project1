<title>FRANCE: Algerians to die for French visa fraud triple murder.</title>
<headline>Algerians to die for French visa fraud triple murder.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-11-03</dateline>

<p>A court in Algeria's western city of Oran has sentenced three Algerians to death for killing the partner of one of them in a French visa fraud, along with his wife and brother-in-law.</p>
<p>The three bodies were found &quot;lying in a sea of blood, hacked to ribbons by knife blows,&quot; the official news agency APS said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Fethallah Izidi, 29, known as &quot;Fettouh&quot;, obtained visas for Algerians seeking entry to France from Amar Bendjeddi, former chief of external relations with Orolait, a regional milk distributor.</p>
<p>The Algerians paid 5,000 French francs for each visa of which Bendjeddi was to pay Izidi 2,000 for introducing &quot;clients&quot;. At the time of the murders he owed Izidi 80,000 francs which he could not pay, the court heard.</p>
<p>Izidi, Farid Bouabida, 29, and Benaouda Benadda, 26, went drinking on the night of the murders, then armed themselves with butcher's knives, Bouabida told the court.</p>
<p>Describing the scene at the victims' house, he said: &quot;Fettouh seized Bendjeddi and knifed him several times while we 'occupied ourselves' with his wife and brother-in-law for fear they would recognise us if we were arrested.</p>
<p>&quot;I made the (couple's) little girl flee because I did not want them to kill her as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Izidi pleaded not guilty but was told by the court president: &quot;Bloodstains on your clothes belong to the group of the victims...and statements of your accomplices are irrefutable proofs that you were one of the authors of this odious crime.&quot;</p>
<p>Executions in Algeria are normally carried out by firing squad. The three have eight days in which to appeal.</p>
