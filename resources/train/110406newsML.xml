<p>President Nelson Mandela called on South Africans on Friday to respect a judge's decision to acquit former defence force chief Magnus Malan of the murder of 13 blacks.</p>
<p>Mandela said in a statement his government would continue to investigate apartheid atrocities and find those responsible for executing and directing them.</p>
<p>&quot;The president reaffirms that the courts are the institutions to determine the guilt of the accused and indeed the judicial findings...must be respected, even, or especially, by those who are aggrieved by these findings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We give the assurance that where persons have died as a result of atrocities, we will continue to investigate who was responsible and who, in regard to alleged 'third force' activities, was responsible for directing these activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Malan was acquitted on Friday of masterminding a massacre carried out by a hit squad, believed to be part of a shadowy &quot;third force&quot;, in 1987 in KwaMakhuta hamlet near the Indian Ocean port city of Durban.</p>
<p>Three generals, a vice-admiral, a brigadier, two majors and a top official of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party were also acquitted, as were six former policemen accused of pulling the triggers in the attack, aimed at supporters of Mandela's then-banned African National Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;The court's judgment of the accused in the 'Malan' trial leaves the country and the government with the task of finding those who were responsible for the massacre of 13 children and women in KwaMakhuta,&quot; Mandela said.</p>
<p>Some analysts have said an acquittal would shake already rickety faith in South Africa's judicial system, but Mandela said he was taking the lead in showing his confidence in the courts.</p>
<p>In comments immediately after the acquittal, Malan thanked Mandela for allowing the accused to defend themselves in a court of law and called the outcome a &quot;victory of justice&quot;.</p>
