<p>Iraq has said for the first time that it fired 93 long-range missiles against Israel and multinational troops in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>&quot;Commander of the Iraqi ground-to-ground missile unit, Lieutenant-General Hazim Abdulrazaq al-Ayaubi, confirmed that the number of Iraqi missiles fired during Um al-Ma'rek (Iraq's name for the Gulf War) was 93,&quot; the official Qadissiya newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said 43 missiles were fired against &quot;military targets&quot; in Israel while 50 were fired against troops in Saudi Arabia, which was the base for U.S.-led multinational force that evicted Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in early 1991.</p>
<p>Previously, Iraq had not disclosed the number of missiles it fired during the war but Israel had said 39 rockets were launched at it.</p>
<p>Accounting for number of long-range missiles acquired by Iraq in the past is among the thorniest issues hindering a complete lifting of the U.N. embargo on Iraqi oil exports imposed after Baghdad's August 1990 invasion.</p>
<p>Ceasefire terms require Baghdad to dispose of all weapons of mass destruction, including missiles with ranges greater than 150 km (95 miles).</p>
<p>Iraq, after talks with the chairman of the U.N. special commission in charge of scraping prohibited Iraqi weapons, agreed on Sunday to remove approximately 100 missile engines out of the country for examination. Baghdad said these were remnants of missiles that were destroyed soon after the war.</p>
