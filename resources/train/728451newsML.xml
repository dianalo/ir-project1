<p>U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun flew into the Congo Republic's battered capital Brazzaville on Tuesday for peace talks, a source close to President Pascal Lissouba said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said a fragile ceasefire, which took effect at midnight, held despite a brief dawn burst of shellfire.</p>
<p>Sahnoun began his visit with talks with Lissouba, who has been locked in a bloody showdown with his predecessor Denis Sassou Nguesso for over a month.</p>
<p>Former military ruler Sassou and Lissouba both put their names to the truce, proposed by Gabon's veteran president, Omar Bongo, to end political and ethnic clashes that have killed hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Sources close to mediation efforts said Bongo invited the two sides plus Brazzaville mayor and national mediator Bernard Kolelas to peace talks in his capital Libreville on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier truces have held a day or so but have disintegrated into fresh mortar and rocket exchanges which have put tens of thousands of civilians to flight and devastated the capital of the oil-producing former French colony.</p>
<p>Sahnoun, who helped negotiate the truce, said on Sunday the talks would focus on national reconciliation and creating an environment for a presidential election in the next two months.</p>
<p>Plans are taking shape for a U.N.-sponsored, mainly African peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>The bloody showdown began on June 5 when soldiers surrounded Sassou's home as part of a crackdown on private militias ahead of a now-postponed July 27 presidential election.</p>
<p>Lissouba, Sassou and Kolelas, whose militia have kept out of the latest fighting, planned to contest the July 27 election.</p>
<p>Lissouba's mandate expires at the end of August. He says the constitution allows a 90-day extension to organise elections. Sassou demands a national salvation government.</p>
<p>Kolelas's militia was at the heart of similar political and ethnic clashes that killed at least 2,000 people in Brazzaville after a disputed 1993 parliamentary election.</p>
