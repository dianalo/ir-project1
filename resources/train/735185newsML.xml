<headline>Hospitals may not cut heart attack deaths - study.</headline>

<p>More and more patients are being admitted to hospitals with heart attacks, but new treatments may not be saving them, British researchers reported on Friday.</p>
<p>A study of two hospitals in Nottingham showed very little change in the death rate among patients, despite increasing use of drugs and other treatment.</p>
<p>Writing in the British Medical Journal, Nigel Brown and colleagues at the University of Nottingham said heart specialists needed to examine the treatments they were offering patients.</p>
<p>Brown's group watched all cases of people admitted to hospital with heart attacks. The numbers increased from 719 in 1982 to 960 in 1992, and many of these were patients over the age of 70.</p>
<p>Use of drugs such as beta-blockers and thrombolytic drugs, which dissolve blood clots, increased during this time. But death rates did not change.</p>
<p>&quot;Disappointingly, we have seen little change in inpatient mortality over the 10 years of our study,&quot; they wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;The use of existing treatments needs to be optimised and new management strategies need to be introduced if inpatient mortality from myocardial infarction (heart attack) is to be reduced,&quot; they concluded.</p>
