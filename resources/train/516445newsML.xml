<p>Golf star Laura Davies plans on becoming the latest two-sport athlete by playing in a United States Indoor Soccer League game Friday following her second round in the Susan G. Komen International golf tournament.</p>
<p>After her round of golf, LPGA Player of the Year Davies will suit up for the minor league game between the Myrtle Beach SeaDawgs and the North Jersey Imperials.</p>
<p>While growing up in England, Davies played soccer. She has a complete soccer field on the grounds of her home in West Byfleet.</p>
<p>Davies would be the only woman in the game if she competes and would match a special double achieved by boxer Roy Jones, who played a United States Basketball League game on June 15, 1996, before scoring an 11th-round knockout of Eric Lucas later that night.</p>
<p>Other contemporary stars who have competed in two professional sports are Michael Jordan, Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders. On October 11, 1992, Sanders played football for the Atlanta Falcons and suited up for -- but did not play -- a game with baseball's Atlanta Braves.</p>
