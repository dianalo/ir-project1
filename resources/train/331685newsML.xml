<p>NWE high sulphur cracked fuel oil was stable on Friday amid poor bunker demand, traders said.</p>
<p>Prompt high sulphur barges traded at $98 fob ARA, while barges for the first decade of February traded $4 higher. Dealers said the lack of bunkering enquiry was depressing demand for prompt barrels.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargo numbers were notionally flat to barges, with February cif cargo swaps flat to barge swaps at around $99/$100 a tonne.</p>
<p>An ARA player was believed to be seeking cargo product, with offers pegged at around a dollar or two over swaps levels.</p>
<p>An Italian refiner was seeking high sulphur barrels for mid to late February. The requirement was for three percent sulphur, ENEL-quality barrels. He expected the requirement to be covered from Italy.</p>
<p>The refiner was also seeking 25,000 tonnes of low sulphur fuel for late next month, and said offers were easy to find.</p>
<p>Dealers said low sulphur fuel was still well supplied although trade on Thursday at around $106 fob NWE had taken some of the length out of the market.</p>
