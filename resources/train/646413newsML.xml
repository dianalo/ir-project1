<text>
<p>Former UK prime minister John Major on Monday urged his successor, Tony Blair, to press for a delay in the European Union's single currency but said it was a pipedream to expect the EU to cancel the project.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not asking him to press for cancellation. That won't happen. European monetary union is clearly in the interests of some of our European partners and they aren't going to cancel it, so let us not have that pipedream,&quot; Major told parliament.</p>
<p>But Major said Britain should press at next week's Amsterdam for a delay in the starting date.</p>
<p>In light of recent information, it was clear the single currency would be a disaster if it was launched as planned on January 1, 1999, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we should go further,&quot; Major added. &quot;We should make it clear that if they do not choose to delay... we will use the vote that we have against each and every country individually that seeks to enter such a single currency if their own economies are not suitable to meet the Maastricht criteria and sustain the Maastricht criteria in the years later.&quot;</p>
<p>He repeated his view that Britain should not join the single currency in 1999 and said he was pleased that Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who was nodding his assent, agreed with him.</p>
