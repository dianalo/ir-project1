<p>Lebanese telecommunications firms submitted their final tenders on Tuesday for a $200 million contract which is the last stage in Lebanon's $800 million project to install 1.7 million telephone lines.</p>
<p>The tender covers 500,000 lines to be distributed equally between the north, the eastern Bekaa valley, south Lebanon and Mount Lebanon.</p>
<p>&quot;We had invited 19 local firms. We received tenders from 11 bidders,&quot; Ghassan Assi, Director General of Equipment and Construction at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We will hopefully award the contract before year-end. We are targeting to finalise the project by the end of 1997 although this is an extremely aggressive time frame,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Assi said Lebanon had decided to exclude international firms from the tender after three large foreign contractors already working on Lebanon's telephone grid submitted &quot;excessively high&quot; bids.</p>
<p>&quot;We would have liked to see (France's) Alcatel, (Germany's) Siemens and (Sweden's) Ericsson work on this project as they are already mobilised and have their teams in Lebanon but we were surprised as to their prices and to their proposed time frame varying between 24 and 36 months,&quot; Assi added.</p>
<p>Lebanon's telecommunications authorities are involved in a $70 million disagreement with LM Ericsson over a 1994 contract to install thousands of telephone lines in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Assi said Ericsson expected an additional $70 million payment for work that it considered outside the contract.</p>
<p>He said the ministry last week amicably resolved similar differences with Alcatel Alsthom and was close to reaching a solution with Siemens AG.</p>
<p>Lebanon's ambitious telecommunications project includes the rehabilitation of the country's war-damaged transmission network, laying down a fibre optic link with Syria and Egypt and building two satellite earth stations.</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of 1996, we will be half-way through implementing our project. We would have covered most of the urban areas and several quasi-urban areas with between 600,000 and 700,000 lines and we would have built two new satellite earth stations, expected to be finished ,&quot; Assi said.</p>
<p>&quot;From 1993 till end 1997, early 1998, the overall value of what we would have invested will be between $800 and $900 million for the provision of 1.7 million lines,&quot; Assi said.</p>
<p>The bulk of the project was awarded in 1993 and 1994 to Ericsson, Alcatel and Siemens.</p>
<p>He said Alcatel had begun working on a fibre optic project under a Lebanese-Syrian-Egyptian telecommunications agreement. The project is due to finish in the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The fibre optic link sea route will extend from Lebanon to Tartous in Syria and Alexandria in Egypt. In Lebanon, it will branch into three sites, Beirut, the southern city of Sidon and northern Tripoli, Assi said.</p>
