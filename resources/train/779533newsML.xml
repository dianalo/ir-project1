<p>The Delhi Stock Exchange (DSE) on Monday launched a satellite communications network to enable electronic trading from nationwide centres and said it expected the move to usher high growth in volumes from small towns.</p>
<p>&quot;There are tonnes and tonnes of funds lying in the semi-urban India which are coming into the stock market,&quot; DSE's executive director S.S. Sodhi said after Finance Minister P. Chidambaram inaugurated the network.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to be in a large number of cities in a short period of time, may be in two months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>DSE president Deepak Chowdhry said the bourse, which currently had 15 very small aperture terminal (VSAT) installations for satellite communications, was expected to add another 75 within a few weeks.</p>
<p>The bourse would also introduce dematerialised trading involving electronic transfer of shares, Chowdhry said. &quot;We will soon be making an application to the NSDL (National Securities Depositary Limited) for membership,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>DSE said in a statement that introduction of electronic trading had boosted trading volumes, and its nationwide spread was expected to increase volumes further.</p>
<p>&quot;The growing investor interest in the Delhi Stock Exchange was revealed by the fact that under an open outcry system of trading before March, 1996, the daily turnover was 400 million rupees ($11.2 million). Under the screen based trading system, the daily volume has increased to 4.0 billion rupees,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Delhi Stock Exchange becomes the third stock exchange of the country after the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange to have such a network through VSATs,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Commencement of trading through the VSAT makes trading through the Delhi Stock Exchange as competitive as through the National Stock Exchange or Bombay Stock Exchange,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading volumes are expected to rise substantially on DSE,&quot; it added. ($1 = 35.7 rupees)</p>
