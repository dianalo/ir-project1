<headline>Indian gilts in demand as call money rates fall.</headline>
<dateline>BOMBAY 1997-02-26</dateline>

<p>Low call money rates triggered off a sharp increase in secondary market trade in Indian government securities on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said call money rates fell below 2.5 percent shortly after opening at 3.5-4.0 percent and ended the day at 1.5-2.0.</p>
<p>&quot;The banking system is flush with funds,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;Further, demand for cash is poor as most banks have completed their borrowings ahead of the reporting Friday.&quot;</p>
<p>Banks report their positions to the Reserve Bank of India every fortnight. The next reporting day is on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the low call money rates resulted in increased buying interest in government securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The traded volumes went up to 3.10 billion rupees from yesterday's 2.48 billion,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said securities with maturities up to the year 2000 were actively traded.</p>
<p>&quot;The zero-coupon 2000 bond was in good demand today,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Besides other medium-term securities were also active. But there was not much movement in prices.&quot;</p>
<p>The 12 percent 1999 government of India stock traded on Wednesday at 99.82 rupees against its last traded price of 99.77, the 13.50 percent 1998 rose to 103.02 from 103 and the 13.40 percent 1999 to 101.78 from 101.75, dealers said.</p>
<p>The zero-coupon 2000 bond was unchanged at 64.82 rupees.</p>
<p>Dealers said treasury bills maturing in April yielded 7.5-7.6 percent, June bills 8.25-8.5 percent and July bills 9.0 percent. dealers said.</p>
