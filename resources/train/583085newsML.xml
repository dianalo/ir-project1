<p>In a country with a genius for pulling off the seemingly impossible when the wolf is at the door, few people are ready to completely write off Italy's chances of joining Europe's single currency elite in 1999.</p>
<p>EU Finance Ministers meeting in Brussels this week approved a report pouring cold water on Italy's efforts to clean up state finances, saying many of the measures taken to cut the public sector deficit were not sustainable.</p>
<p>More tough budgetary medicine was needed in 1998 to prevent the deficit from blowing out again, the report said.</p>
<p>North of the Alps Italy's chances of being allowed to sign up for economic and monetary union (EMU) are believed to be fading fast. But the mood in Italy is one of determination to prove that the faceless &quot;accountants&quot; in Brussels have got their sums wrong.</p>
<p>Finger-wagging from Brussels is being received by Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left government as an exhortation to prepare a 1998 budget putting Italy's EMU credentials beyond doubt, rather than a reason to give up.</p>
<p>&quot;The government wants to deprive the European Commission of arguments to justify keeping Italy out of the first round of EMU,&quot; said Claudio Tosato, an economist with Deutsche Bank in Milan.</p>
<p>The EU executive commission has urged Rome to replace one-off budgetary measures -- including an unpopular &quot;Eurotax&quot; -- with structural measures which would have a &quot;permanent impact on the budget&quot;.</p>
<p>Italy is on course to bring down its budget deficit to three percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, a target laid down for all would-be mebers of EMU.</p>
<p>The Commission upset Rome in April when it forecast the Italian 1997 deficit at 3.2 percent, a whisker above the target enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>Economists say the Commission was paying Italy a backhanded compliment even though France and Germany -- the EMU front-runners -- were seen hitting the three percent target. For Italy to cut its deficit from 6.7 percent to within spitting distance of three percent is no mean feat, they say.</p>
<p>But the real challenge to Italy was contained in the Commission's April forecast of a 1998 deficit of 3.9 percent. This number is at the heart of the Commission's argument that Italy's current efforts -- no matter how heroic -- cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>&quot;The real message was the forecast of a 3.9 percent deficit in 1998. That is even higher than the forecast deficit for Greece,&quot; said Tosato.</p>
<p>To beat the Commission at the numbers game in 1998 Italy has to come up with a package that permanently slices at least 25 trillion lire ($15 billion) off the budget deficit next year.</p>
<p>That is a relatively small amount compared with the monster budgets of recent years but it will require cuts of some seven to eight trillion lire in pensions and welfare -- a political minefield.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is basically political. The will is there in the government but the problem is finding a parliamentary majority to approve a budget calling for cuts in welfare payments and pensions,&quot; said a London-based economist.</p>
<p>The far-left Communist Refoundation party, whose votes keep the government afloat in the lower house of parliament, has said it will oppose welfare cuts.</p>
<p>But analysts say Prodi may appeal for support from the centre-right opposition to get the budget through.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be very difficult to deliver politically, but it's not impossible,&quot; said Francesco Giordano, economist at CSFB in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that Brussels does not want Italy in is becoming more explicit but if Italy manages to hit the three percent target both in 1997 and 1998 it is not going to be easy for them to keep Italy out,&quot; said Giordano. ($ = 1680 Italian Lire)</p>
