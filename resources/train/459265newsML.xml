<p>ASEAN countries on Friday rallied around Vietnam's call for China to stop exploration in a disputed offshore area and solve the row around a negotiating table.</p>
<p>&quot;China should stop its oil exploration activities in the said area so as to help the early peaceful resolution of the problem,&quot; the Hanoi embassy of one of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' seven member countries said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ambassadors from ASEAN countries, who were briefed on the dispute by Deputy Foreign Ministry Vu Khoan on Thursday, said China had not responded to Vietnam's call for talks.</p>
<p>&quot;They have told China that they would like to discuss this matter, but there has been no response,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Vietnam joined the formerly non-communist ASEAN group, which includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, in mid-1995.</p>
<p>Hanoi said last weekend that it had protested to China over the positioning of the Kan Tan III drilling rig off its central coast. It said coastguards had repeatedly sent warnings after the rig and accompanying vessels arrived in the area on March 7.</p>
<p>Beijing responded that the rig was in Chinese waters and that its activities were above reproach.</p>
<p>Vietnam, which normally keeps diplomatic manoeuvring with its giant neighbour behind firmly closed doors, has moved to raise the international profile of the issue.</p>
<p>Foreign journalists have been granted unusual access to government officials to discuss the competing sovereignty claims and on Thursday the Foreign Ministry repeated both its claim and its call for negotiations.</p>
<p>The ministry's briefing of ASEAN ambassadors, who were shown an aerial photograph of the drilling rig and maps, also appeared to have brought at least moral support from regional neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that they must stop because...there are three to four miles of pipeline in the economic zone of Vietnam,&quot; said one of the ambassadors. &quot;So far the feeling... among the ASEAN ambassadors is that Vietnam is right.&quot;</p>
<p>The embassy statement said that while it was a bilateral issue, it did pose a threat to peace and stability in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Consequently, there is a need for Vietnam and China to come to the negotiating table with a view to providing a diplomatic solution to the problem based on the principles of international law,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Other countries have not commented on the row.</p>
<p>However, U.S. Admiral Joseph Prueher, who was in Vietnam to build on military relations between the two former foes, said he was optimistic that the matter would be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>Although ideological allies, Hanoi and Beijing have long been at odds over competing claims on parts of the Tonkin Gulf, areas along their ill-defined land border and the Paracel and Spratly Islands. They are among six regional claimants to the Spratlys.</p>
<p>According to one diplomat, scheduled bilateral talks on the Tonkin Gulf had -- at China's suggestion -- been pushed back from early April to later that month because of the latest row.</p>
<p>The ASEAN envoys said they were shown a map with territorial base lines drawn between islands off the Vietnamese coast and around China's Hainan island. The position of the rig was marked on the Vietnamese side of a median between those two lines.</p>
<p>A coastguard on Con Co island, a marker for Vietnam's base line, said he had seen no naval movements in recent days.</p>
