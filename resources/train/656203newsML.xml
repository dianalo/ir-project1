<p>The Mexican bolsa extended its advance into record territory and chalked up sharp gains in early trade on Thursday on what traders said were technical breakthroughs by key blue-chips spurred by continuing strong gains on Wall Street and fund flows.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically it's a technical breakthrough driven by heavily weighted stocks like Telmex, GFB and Vitro,&quot; a desk trader said.  The leading IPC share index was up 40.73 points, or 0.97 percent, at 4,235.17. The IPC had reached an intraday record of 4,239.00 in the opening minutes of trade. Trading volume was heavy at 41.7 million shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a combination of several factors.  Big U.S. funds are stepping in here, and U.S. data released show that inflationary pressures have eased, but the bonanza there will be limited,&quot; another desk trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers said lower yields on U.S. long bonds had also prompted a switch of funds to stock markets on Wall Street and in Mexico.  The 30-year Treasury bond was up 26/32 to yield 6.78 percent.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones meanwhile added 51.52 points to Wednesday's record close to stand at 7,627.35.  </p>
<p>Telmex L shares had climbed 22 centavos to set a new record in peso terms of 19.14. The telecomms firm's ADRs had meanwhile gained 1/2 to 48, a level unseen since the December 1994 devaluation crisis. Telmex ADRs had, however, traded at more than $70 in February 1994.</p>
<p>Financial stock Bancomer was ahead six centavos to 3.33 pesos. Glassmaker Vitro had gained 45 centavos to 25.65. Dealers said Vitro had also gained on expectations its second quarter earnings would improve from a disappointing first quarter.  </p>
<p>On the broad market, of 72 shares traded, gainers far outpaced sliders, by 44 to six.</p>
<p>Mining company Grupo Mexico series L shares were the most heavily traded stock, up 1.10 pesos to 23.10 pesos. The stock advanced after a single sale of 20 million shares by Asarco Inc. Grupo Mexico's L series is not included in the IPC.</p>
