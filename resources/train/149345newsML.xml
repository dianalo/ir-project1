<p>Middlesbrough's England forward Nick Barmby signed for premier league Everton on Tuesday for 5.75 million pounds ($9.2 million).</p>
<p>The 22-year-old, who had also been linked to Liverpool and Leeds United before Tuesday's announcement, moves to Merseyside just over a year after joining Middlesbrough from Tottenham Hotspur for 5.25 million pounds ($8.4 million).</p>
<p>Barmby, capped 10 times for England, was Middlesbrough's top scorer in the league last season with seven goals. He has scored just once this season and failed to secure a permanent first team place.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to thank Nick for the service he has given to Middlesbrough during his 15 months with the club and wish him every success in the future,&quot; Middlesbrough chief executive Keith Lamb said.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough coach Bryan Robson said over the weekend he had come to the conclusion he could not play Juninho and Barmby in the same side as the two players were too similiar.</p>
<p>Juninho joined Middlesbrough a year ago and although he has failed to live up to his expected promise, Robson has decided to utilise his talents rather than Barmby's.</p>
<p>Barmby graduated from the English Football Associatioon's School of Excellence and joined Tottenham as a teenager and upset many Spurs fans when he left the London club last year saying he was homesick and wanted to return to the north of England.</p>
