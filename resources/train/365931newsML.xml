<p>Anglo-Dutch food processing and consumer products group Unilever is poised to sell its German Nordsee fish business for around 200 million pounds ($328 million), the Observer newspaper said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The British weekly said the move, which is imminent but will not be completed in time to be announced at the group's 1996 results on Tuesday, was part of Unilever's strategy of selling off underperforming businesses.</p>
<p>A Unilever spokesman told Reuters the company did not comment on such proposals saying it would &quot;make announcements as appropriate&quot;.</p>
<p>The Observer said several firms were interested in buying Nordsee, Germany's number one fish business. Nordsee is made up of three divisions -- frozen fish products, fish restaurants and retail and a wholesale unit.</p>
<p>Since taking over as Unilever chairman in September, Niall FitzGerald has talked about re-shaping the group to give it a sharper focus.</p>
<p>Industry sources said there had been talks with third parties about the possible sale of Nordsee as well as consultation with staff at the German division.</p>
