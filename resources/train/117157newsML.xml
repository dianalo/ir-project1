<p>Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp urged President Bill Clinton on Tuesday to order a refund of Democratic Party contributions from a family with ties to an Indonesian banking group.</p>
<p>In a statement, Kemp also asked Clinton to order the Democratic National Committee to fire a former Commerce Department official, John Huang, a Democratic fundraiser who reportedly solicited foreign funds.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything less would constitute tacit approval from Bill Clinton of this gross violation of federal election law,&quot; said Kemp.</p>
<p>Clinton on Tuesday deferred to the Federal Election Commission to decide whether the controversial donations should be accepted.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the political parties should not give back contributions that were legally made and legally received,&quot; Clinton said in response to a question on a campaign swing in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
<p>If the party &quot;made a mistake and took in money that shouldn't have been taken they ought to give that back. There are clear FEC rules on this, there's a law on this. That's what we've got a Federal Election Commission for and we know they're capable of doing the job,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>The contributions have become political fodder for Republicans who have charged they should be investigated for possible illegalities.</p>
<p>In a hard-hitting speech here before his last debate with Clinton on Wednesday, Dole too said the &quot;this administration has allowed a wealthy Indonesian family to buy presidential access.&quot;</p>
<p>Kemp alleged that $450,000 in donations to the Democratic Party &quot;was funnelled through an immigrant gardener to avoid U.S. limits on foreign contributions.&quot;</p>
<p>That man he referred to and his wife were living legally in Virginia at the time of the contributions but had family connections to the Riady family that controls the Lippo Group banking combine in Indonesia.</p>
<p>There has been no allegation that Clinton's campaign itself received any money. It is against the law for foreigners to give money to federal campaigns generally so they cannot influence U.S. policy but there are exceptions for legal resident immigrants if the money is their own.</p>
<p>Huang, a former president of the Lippo Group USA operations, reportedly has solicited some $4 million in contributions for the Democratic Party. The Democratic National Committee, the party's administrative arm, had to return $250,000 when it was revealed that it had come from a South Korean firm.</p>
<p>Riady family members did business with an Arkansas bank when Clinton was governor and Riady family members had visited the White House.</p>
<p>&quot;Give back the money Mr. President and take down the 'for sale' sign over the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,&quot; Kemp said in a statement given reporters by the Dole campaign.</p>
