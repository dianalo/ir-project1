<p>A 22-year-old Canadian man has been arrested for possession of a hugh stash of child pornography gathered from the Internet, with some images showing children drugged and in pain, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>The seizure from the home of Trevor Davis in the small city of Kirkland Lake in Northern Ontario, was believed to be the largest of child pornography in Canada with confiscation of 20,000 computer files containing video clips and photos, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;It just rips the heart right out from you,&quot; said Ontario Provincial Police Sgt. Bob Matthews. &quot;I found it absolutely disgusting.&quot;</p>
<p>Police said the images recovered in the October raid showed chilren having sex with other children and animals, and others involving bondage and drugs.</p>
<p>Canadian police worked in conjuction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States and its investigation into an Internet child pornography ring in California.</p>
<p>In addition to possession of pornography, police charged Davis of making, distributing and importing child pornography. He was to appear in court on Nov. 18.</p>
<p>Matthews said a conviction of simple possession of child pornography can result in a jail sentence of up to five years while the other charges also carry long terms.</p>
<p>The Canadian police also seized computer hardware and software, chidren's clothing, women's undergarments and documentation from Davis' home.</p>
