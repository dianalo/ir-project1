<p>Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday he was astounded thaader Jose Ramos-Horta had won this year's Nobel Peace Prize, calling him a &quot;political adventurist&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We think he is a political adventurist, for a while representing a very small minority but...(now) repudiated by the majority of the people of East Timor,&quot; he told Reuters Television on a visit to the German city of Hamburg.</p>
<p>&quot;All I can say is that I'm quite astounded at the choice of the Nobel commitee,&quot; Alatas said, adding Ramos-Hortha could not be compared to previous winners of the prestigious prize.</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder what effect it will have on the value of earlier Nobel Peace Prizes given to such illustrous people like Mr (Nelson) Mandela and Mr (Yasser) Arafat who have brought peace to real conflicts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Indonesian troops invaded East Timor in December 1975 and Jakarta formally annexed it in July 1976. The United Nations does not recognise Indonesian rule in East Timor and regards former colonial ruler Portugal as the administering power.</p>
<p>But Portugal backs the demands of resistance groups that East Timor, which is Roman Catholic while Indonesia is Moslem, should be allowed to decide freely on its future.</p>
<p>Ramos-Hortha, who lives in Australia, was awarded the prize jointly with East Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo. Alatas did not comment on the bishop.</p>
<p>&quot;He really represents no-one but himself,&quot; Alatas said of Ramos-Hortha. &quot;What has he really contributed to peace? On the contrary, I think it is he and his group which started all the trouble for the majority of the East Timorese people.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nobel committe said it hoped the award would &quot; spur efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in East Timor based on the people's right to self-determination&quot;.</p>
<p>Alatas commented: &quot;I think if this is the kind of message that is sent, I'm afraid, honestly, that it's the wrong message.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the Indonesian government would not, however, be making a formal protest to the Nobel committee. &quot;Why should we send a protest note?&quot; he said. &quot;It's not important enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if thortha to return to East Timor, Alatas replied: &quot;I think you should ask him whether he dares to come back to East Timor because he will have the people of East Timor against him.&quot;</p>
