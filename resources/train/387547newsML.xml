<p>Vefa Holding, Albania's biggest holding company which froze client accounts during a pyramid investment scandal last month, said on Wednesday it would pay back immediately all deposits by small investors.</p>
<p>Vefa, which has 240 businesses and 80,000 investors, said that from today it would make full repayment to all investors who had put up to $5,000 in the company.</p>
<p>The decision was taken by Vehbi Alimucaj, Vefa Holding President, and the company said it would take two to three weeks to repay the small investors who make up about 60 percent of Vefa's clients.</p>
<p>The Vefa move was intended to calm investors' nerves and disperse hundreds of people who have waited outside Vefa offices for the past month hoping to get their money back.</p>
<p>Investors will get back only their capital investment and none of the interest due, company representative Arben Iliazi told Reuters.</p>
<p>Albania has been swept by protests and riots since January, when five fraudulent pyramid investment schemes collapsed.</p>
<p>The collapses put the spotlight on other investment firms, such as Vefa, which froze its clients' account fearing a run of panic withdrawals. Three other companies took similar steps but Vefa is the best known investment firm in Albania.</p>
<p>Officials have estimated $1 to $2 billion were invested in the fraudulent schemes, leaving many Albanians penniless and triggering a popular outcry against the government.</p>
<p>Vefa is a household word in Albania. Its name is on foods, supermarkets and a television station. Iliazi said that small investors represented the greatest number and the poorest sector of the population.</p>
<p>&quot;We will put their concerns to rest when they receive their capital,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After small investors who wish to withdraw funds have done so, investors who put in $5,000 to $10,000 will be able to withdraw money, and then those who invested $10,000 to $20,000.</p>
<p>Vefa said that from now on only those investors who want to withdraw capital should go to its offices. Vefa has employed heavily armed private security guards to control the people standing outside its offices.</p>
<p>About 100 people were outside Vefa's Tirana office after the decision to pay back capital.</p>
<p>When one middle-aged woman was told the news by reporters, she said: &quot;If Vefa gives back our money, it is blessed. If not, it knows all these people have cursed it&quot;.</p>
