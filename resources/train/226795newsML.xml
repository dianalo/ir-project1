<p>Israeli-Palestinian talks on implementing self-rule in the West Bank town of Hebron have made no real progress, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was quoted as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;No practical and tangible progress is being made on the ground because of the rejection by the Israeli side to implement what has been agreed,&quot; Arafat said, quoted by the Jordanian state news agency Petra as he passed through Jordan on his way to the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Arafat said the Israeli negotiating team in talks on the redeployment of Israeli troops &quot;wanted to change a number of key articles in the Hebron accord, which is what the Palestinian side rejects.&quot;</p>
<p>Under an interim PLO-Israel accord, Israel was to give the PLO self-rule in seven West Bank towns. It handed over six. The Hebron pullout was delayed by a wave of Moslem militant suicide bombings that killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
<p>The main sticking point has been Israel's insistence on &quot;hot pursuit&quot; -- the right to chase wanted persons in the 80 percent of Hebron to come under PLO-rule. The PLO refuses to make changes in the signed deal.</p>
<p>The Palestinian ambassador in Amman, Omar al-Khatib, told Reuters that Arafat had gone to Abu Dhabi to see UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan and brief him on the latest developments in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>Arafat would head for Qatar later on Saturday, Khatib said.</p>
<p>Arafat, crossing from the West Bank, was met by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti at the Allenby Bridge where they discussed the Hebron talks.</p>
<p>For two months PLO and Israeli negotiators have been struggling to come to terms on a long-overdue handover of most of the West Bank town of Hebron to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he wants to change the Hebron accord to boost security for the 400 Jews living in the heart of the city among more than 100,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>On Thursday Netanyahu, a right-winger who inherited the accord from a left-centre government he ousted in May elections, accused the Palestinians of not being interested in achieving a Hebron breakthrough.</p>
