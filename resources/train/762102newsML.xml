<p>Select Appointments Holdings Plc said growth in the temporary employment business is being driven by strong demand for information technology (IT) workers around the world.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with Reuters, Chairman Tony Martin also said the British company is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that it will earn $0.14 per ADR (American Depositary Receipt) when it reports second quarter results on August 6.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think that's reasonable,&quot; Martin said. &quot;Obviously, we have looked at the market forecasts for this quarter quite closely and we think that's quite reasonable. And for the rest of the year, I think we're quite comfortable with the market projections as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts expect the company to earn $0.60 per ADR for the full year.</p>
<p>As for the company's business operations, Martin said the boom in temporary information technology workers shows no sign of slowing and likely will be immune to any future weakness in global economies.  </p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people in our industry can't see an end to it. The demand for IT is totally sensational,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to information technology, Select Appointments targets workers in 15 other industries, including teachers and healthcare.</p>
<p>Martin said the company would like to expand in the financial services sector, specifically banking and insurance.</p>
<p>He said the growth may come from acquisitions, noting the company hopes to make one or two more acquisitions in Europe this year. Last month it announced an acquisition in the Netherlands.  </p>
<p>Half of the company's revenues are generated in the U.S., and Martin said he would like to expand in other areas so that the business is more evenly divided geographically.</p>
<p>The temporary worker business has grown tremendously in the past several years due to widespread corporate cost-cutting as companies seek to cut back on worker benefits and human resources expenses. Also, the boom in corporate mergers has often resulted in demand for additional workers as companies seek to combine computer systems and administrative operations.</p>
<p>&quot;When you consolidate companies, it actually makes more work,&quot; Martin said.</p>
