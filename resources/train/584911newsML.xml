<p>Israeli and PLO officials on Wednesday stuck to their opposing positions on Israeli building in Jerusalem as they headed for meetings with a U.S. envoy trying to break a deadlock in peace talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel's position on Har Homa is known,&quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel radio in reference to a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem that drew international criticism.</p>
<p>Negotiations have been largely stalled since Israel broke ground for the settlement on March 18 and a Palestinian bomber killed himself and three Israeli women at a Tel Aviv cafe on March 21.</p>
<p>Levy said ahead of his departure for a meeting on Friday with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Washington he hoped for a quick resumption of Israel-PLO negotiations on the implementation of peace accords.</p>
<p>Asked when he wanted to renew the talks, Levy said: &quot;I wish today, yesterday. But we must not give up and we must put things back on a constructive track.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton's special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross has been in the region trying to arrange a meeting of the two sides.</p>
<p>Ross was due to meet top PLO negotiator Saeb Erakat in the West Bank town of Jericho on Wednesday ahead of a three-way meeting with Israeli representatives later in the day at the Tel Aviv residence of U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk.</p>
<p>Erakat told Reuters ahead of his meeting with Ross: &quot;As far as we are concerned there is one item on the agenda tonight: that Israel must stop all settlement activities including Jabel Abu Ghneim.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to the Arabic name of the hill on which Israel started the Har Homa settlement.</p>
<p>Erakat said he was meeting Ross to coordinate the meeting with the Israelis, which Palestinians stressed was a probe towards resuming negotiations but did not constitute actual negotiations.</p>
<p>Palestinians are demanding a halt to Jewish settlement building in East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, areas where they envisage an independent state. Israel wants Palestinians to crack down on militants opposed to peace.</p>
<p>Israel's Haaretz newspaper said last week that Clinton was not interested in a head-on collision with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of a settlement freeze, fearing a confrontation with the U.S. Congress and with the U.S. Jewish community.</p>
<p>The daily said this was despite the fact that Clinton and Albright were dissatisfied with Netanyahu's continuing Jewish settlement building, which they viewed as harming peace moves.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said on Sunday he was proud of his March decision that sent bulldozers to carve out the Har Homa settlement.</p>
<p>Ross's mission to the region is his second in a month and has taken him to Jordan and Egypt as well as Israel and Palestinian self-rule enclaves.</p>
<p>PLO officials have criticised Washington for what they said is its refusal to press Israel to halt settlement activities in Palestinian areas during mediation to restart the talks. Israel says it will not stop settlements.</p>
