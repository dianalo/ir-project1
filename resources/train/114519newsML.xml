<p>Nations seeking to qualify for European monetary union do not need to hit the EMU debt criterion exactly to qualify, Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Krupp said on Monday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a savings bank meeting in Hamburg, the president of the Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Schleswig-Holstein central bank said there would be room to manoeuvre, particularly in the area of public debt.</p>
<p>&quot;The 60-percent debt-to-GDP ratio is barely justifiable on grounds of economic theory, as (the debt) is above all a product of historical developments,&quot; said Krupp.</p>
<p>Krupp went on to say: &quot;As the example of Belgium shows, extremely high levels of Belgian government debt do not work against its close relationship with the deutschemark and low rates of inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Belgium, which has debt of around 130 percent of its total economic output, has maintained a stable currency for the last few years and has its interest rates closely pegged to those of the mark.</p>
<p>The Maastricht criteria were &quot;not so flexible that every EU country could take advantage of them,&quot; and it was foreseeable &quot;that not all EU countries would take part in monetary union in 1999,&quot; Krupp said.</p>
<p>But he made clear that there could be no flexibility on the other criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>Sticking to the stability criteria regarding inflation, exchange rates and long-term interest rates was unavoidable and there could be no room for interpretation on these matters, Krupp said.</p>
<p>Krupp said after the meeting that he thought there was no doubt that Germany would fulfil the criteria necessary for monetary union. He did express reservations about Britain, however.</p>
<p>&quot;It is regrettable that Britain and Sweden have decided to forego obligatory membership of monetary union,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the case of Britain this casts further doubt on the appropriateness of that country being within Europe. As it is legally contentious whether or not a country can be forced to take part in monetary union under EU rules, it will have to follow of its own free will,&quot; said Krupp.</p>
<p>Krupp said he also thought that if Germany did not come in under the three percent criteria, it could have negative effects on the currency.</p>
<p>He said he expected the single currency to have only narrow fluctuations against the dollar and the yen.</p>
