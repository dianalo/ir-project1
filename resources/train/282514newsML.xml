<p>Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz on Tuesday dismissed as &quot;blackmail&quot; calls for Berne to set up a compensation fund for Jews who might be entitled to money left in Swiss banks after the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Delamuraz in a newspaper interview also accused foreign critics of trying to undermine Switzerland's role as a world financial centre with accusations the Swiss profited cynically from World War Two.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic competition is fierce and this affair proves it,&quot; Delamuraz told the French-language Swiss newspaper Tribune de Geneve.</p>
<p>In some of the strongest language used so far by Berne politicians, Delamuraz brushed off demands by the World Jewish Congress (WJC) and a U.S. senator for quick compensation for Holocaust survivors and heirs who say Swiss banks have denied them money left there as a safe haven from Nazi looting.</p>
<p>He rejected creation of a $250 million fund he said had been proposed to special ambassador Thomas Borer, who met critics from the WJC and U.S. Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato in December.</p>
<p>&quot;This is nothing less than extortion and blackmail. This fund would make it much more difficult to establish the truth,&quot; Delamuraz said. &quot;Such a fund would be considered an admission of guilt.&quot;</p>
<p>Delamuraz repeated Berne's stance that any compensation measures should wait for the findings of a nine-member historical panel named by the cabinet two weeks ago to investigate the Swiss financial role in World War Two.</p>
<p>He said the government's disquiet at more than a year of criticism of Swiss banks and the country's war role was not only &quot;due to the nature of the revelations but equally to the not very pure intentions which lay at their origin.&quot;</p>
<p>Delamuraz, who is also economics minister and hands the rotating one-year presidency to Justice Minister Arnold Koller as of January 1, said the initial Swiss reponse to the criticism had been naive.</p>
<p>&quot;No one...appears to see that apart from dogged research into historical truth there is also a strong political desire to destabilise and compromise Switzerland.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This has one link in Washington and another in London, where it was a matter of nothing else than trying to demolish Switzerland's status as a financial centre,&quot; Delamuraz said.</p>
<p>Swiss politicians and bankers have long argued privately that bad publicity over lost Holocaust accounts and purchases of Nazi gold by the Swiss National Bank was aimed in part at weakening the growing global role of Swiss banks.</p>
<p>Berne set up the nine-member panel of Swiss and international historians -- including an Israeli and the director of the Holocaust Museum in Washington -- to report back in at most five years on the extent and fate of Jewish wealth and Nazi loot sent to neutral Switzerland during the war.</p>
<p>The commission is separate from an international panel set up by Swiss banks and world Jewish groups last May to search for individual lost Holocaust accounts and help return the assets to their rightful owners.</p>
