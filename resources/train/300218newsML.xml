<title>PORTUGAL: Bank of Portugal cuts repo rate to 6.50 percent.</title>

<p>The Bank of Portugal said it cut its repo rate by 20 basis points to 6.50 percent and that it left the absorption rate used to drain funds from the money market unchanged at 6.20 percent.</p>
<p>It also left its emergency lending rate steady at 8.30 percent.  </p>
<p>The Bank of Portugal said it offered to inject 10 billion escudos into the money market at a fixed rate of 6.50 percent effective on Monday at the start of a new central bank reserve period. Bids must be submitted by 1515 GMT.</p>
<p>Five out of seven analysts polled by Reuters had said they did not expect a cut in the repo rate on Friday. However, they all said there was room for a cut in the future.  </p>
<p>Isabel Cabral of Lisbon broker Fincor said &quot;The rate cut is a consequence of the rise of the escudo. There is room for a further cut in the repo rate and possibly, also the absorption rate, by the end of February.&quot;</p>
<p>Jose Carlos Andre, chief dealer of BCI, said &quot;The money market has so far ignored the repo rate cut because it had already eased back this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think that this decision by the Bank of Portugal is well-considered and is a result of the recent appreciation of the escudo against the mark,&quot; said Mario Dias Vigario of Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>&quot;It is preferable to cut the repo rate than to intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit the rise of the escudo,&quot; he added.  </p>
