<p>Mexicans reacted with joy and disbelief on Monday to news the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) had likely lost its exclusive 68-year grip on power in weekend mid-term elections.</p>
<p>Mexicans, few old enough to remember any other party in government, said the country had thrown off its decades-long yoke of single-party rule in one night.</p>
<p>&quot;It's as if we have woken up from a long nightmare,&quot; said Jose Ramon Ortiz, a 55-year-old shopowner in Mexico City's bohemian Condesa neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Partial official results showed the PRI, in power since it was founded in 1929, lost control of Congress and the capital city for the first time, giving the opposition a voice in government after decades in the political wilderness.</p>
<p>It looked like the biggest setback for the PRI since it was founded after the 1910-1917 Mexican Revolution.</p>
<p>&quot;The PRI lost,&quot; Mexico City's La Cronica newspaper blared in a front-page headline.</p>
<p>El Financiero daily said: &quot;70 years of hegemony ended.&quot;</p>
<p>Until just a few years ago, the PRI controlled the presidency, congress, and every major city and state in the country through unrivalled political machinery. It lost its first state governorship only in 1989.</p>
<p>For many Mexicans, the PRI is synonymous with government. Its party colours are that of the flag and no other party is allowed to use the same red, white and green.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm shocked. It's always been PRI, PRI, PRI and nothing but the PRI in Mexico,&quot; said Raul Ramirez, a 35-year-old shoeshiner on the city's central Reforma avenue.</p>
<p>Many taxis in Mexico City on Monday sported yellow bumper stickers of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, whose Mexico City mayoral candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas won a massive victory.</p>
<p>&quot;I've never had the guts to put one of these up before,&quot; confessed taxi driver Ricardo Vilchy.</p>
<p>Newspapers described the PRI's defeat as the country's final step toward democracy after decades of slight reforms that left the PRI still holding all the cards and most citizens wondering if anything would ever change.</p>
<p>Even President Ernesto Zedillo smiled broadly in a nationally televised address on Sunday night as returns showed his PRI falling in defeat. He said he was proud Mexico had become a full democracy.</p>
<p>Many Mexicans seemed surprised the vote had gone off peacefully -- fearing PRI hardliners would push the country into almost epic violence characterised by the bloody 1910-17 Revolution.</p>
<p>&quot;Transparency won, legality won, pluralism won, the separation of powers won. The hopes of citizens, long delayed, to establish a real democracy, also won,&quot; Mexico's leftist La Jornada newspaper said in a front-page editorial.</p>
