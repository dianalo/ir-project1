<headline>Israeli business leader slams IMF stance.</headline>

<text>
<p>The head of Israel's Manufacturers Association criticised the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for strongly supporting the Bank of Israel's tight monetary policy, the association said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a letter to IMF Director-General Michel Camdessus, Dan Propper said an interim IMF report released on September 11 supported the central bank's policy without any mention of opposing views.</p>
<p>A full text of the letter appeared in Hebrew translation in the Israeli business daily Globes, but the association refused to release the original English-language version.</p>
<p>Propper said he and other business leaders had told a visiting IMF team that the Bank of Israel had artificially reduced inflation by raising interest rates, thus causing the shekel to become overvalued.</p>
<p>He said high interest rates had damaged the domestic capital market and had worsened Israel's current account deficit.</p>
<p>In its interim report the IMF criticised Israel's expansionary fiscal policy and praised the current government for seeking to restrain spending. It supported Bank of Israel policy, which caused short-term base rates to rise to as much as 17.0 percent earlier this year. A final report is due by year end.</p>
<p>Propper has waged a long-running war against the central bank and its governor, Jacob Frenkel, over monetary policy.</p>
