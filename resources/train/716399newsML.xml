<title>ISRAEL: New Israel finance chief vows to meet deficit goal.</title>
<headline>New Israel finance chief vows to meet deficit goal.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>Israel's newly appointed Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman said on Wednesday he would stick to budget deficit targets and favoured lowering income tax rates.</p>
<p>&quot;As the national treasurer, I will ensure adherence to the budget law to the letter,&quot; Neeman told Israel's Channel One television. &quot;I did not join the government to break the law.&quot;</p>
<p>Neeman did not say where he might cut the budget to ensure deficit targets set by law -- 2.8 percent of gross domestic product this year, 2.4 percent in 1998 and 1.2 percent within five years -- are met.</p>
<p>&quot;We will sit down with each minister and reach agreement (on spending cuts),&quot; he said. Deliberations on the 1998 budget are due to begin in August.</p>
<p>Treasury officials have recommended a four billion shekel budget cut next year.</p>
<p>But Israeli newspapers reported on Wednesday that promises Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave coalition partners to defuse government crises will cost the Treasury up to three billion shekels ($841.7 million).</p>
<p>Neeman said he has always favoured reducing the tax burden on Israelis.</p>
<p>&quot;I will work towards lowering the (income) tax rate,&quot; he said, without giving any figures. The top income tax bracket stands at 50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be a more equitable distribution of the tax burden. Direct taxation must not rise in Israel. If we raise direct taxation we will collect less revenues,&quot; Neeman said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, parliament approved Neeman's appointment to the post. He replaces Dan Meridor, a long-time rival of Netanyahu who quit in a power struggle with the prime minister last month.</p>
<p>Neeman told a news conference he could not give full attention to his new post for another month because he is also heading a panel on the issue of conversion to Judaism.</p>
<p>&quot;To my great misfortune I have another position in addition to my position at the ministry, a position perhaps even more difficult than finance minister,&quot; he said at a news conference marking his appointment in parliament earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The one fortunate aspect of this is that we have set August 15 as the date to complete the work. I hope we keep to this timetable and that I can devote my full attention to the ministry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The committee is working to find a compromise to controversial legislation that would enshrine in law Orthodox rabbis' long-standing monopoly on religious conversions to Judaism.</p>
<p>The legislation won preliminary approval from parliament in April but has caused an uproar in the influential Jewish community in the United States and is being challenged by non-Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Neeman, a corporate attorney and former Treasury director-general, is active politically but unusually for an Israeli cabinet minister has not held elected office.</p>
<p>Meridor's term was characterised by political infighting with Netanyahu and tensions with the central bank over monetary and fiscal policy.</p>
