<p>Lowe &amp; Partners Worldwide, The Lowe Group's main advertising network, said on Tuesday it had significantly expanded in Latin America by establishing its first presence in Argentina and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Frank Lowe, the chairman and founder of The Lowe Group, which is owned by Interpublic Group of Companies Inc in the United States, said the agency had taken a &quot;substantial&quot; minority stake in two creative-led ad agencies.</p>
<p>He said the new link-ups with Agulla &amp; Baccetti in Buenos Aires and Concept Publicidad in Caracas were important for Lowe, which, like other Western-based agency networks, faced slow growth in the advertising industries in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe is not growing very dramatically. The U.S. is not,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Lowe &amp; Partners has described Latin America and Asia as priority growth areas for its network.</p>
<p>Jose Eduardo Cazarin, the president of Lowe &amp; Partners Latin America, based in Brazil, told journalists the new partnerships meant Lowe now had a presence in Latin America's five most important advertising markets.</p>
<p>Lowe already had a minority stake in agencies in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia.</p>
<p>Cazarin told Reuters that Lowe expected to announce a new partnership soon with an ad agency in Chile.</p>
<p>He also said Lowe &amp; Partners would be looking next year at possible link-ups with local agencies in Uruguay, Peru, Puerto Rico and somewhere in Central America.</p>
<p>Lowe is ranked 13th among worldwide agency networks, with $3.6 billion in billings.</p>
<p>Frank Lowe said it was crucial for advertising agency networks to be present in the same emerging markets as their multinationals clients.</p>
<p>But he said the method used by U.S.-based networks that traditionally set up their own branch offices in emerging markets no longer really worked.</p>
<p>Lowe said it made more sense now for Western-based networks like Lowe to link up with local partners, who knew the local market and culture, and knew what kind of advertising would work.</p>
<p>He declined to give details on how much money Lowe was investing in the agencies in Venezuela and Argentina.</p>
<p>Juan Quilici, the general manager of Concept Publicidad, said the link with Lowe would empower his agency and its mostly Venezuelan-based clients.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to open windows to the world. I think the Lowe group can do that for us,&quot; he told the joint news conference.</p>
<p>Quilici said the Lowe partnership with Concept Publicidad, which had been the leading independent advertising agency in Venezuela, now placed it eighth or ninth among agency networks in Caracas.</p>
<p>Ramiro Agulla, who founded Agulla &amp; Bacetti in Argentina with Carlos Bacetti in 1989, said the advertising industry in Latin America was growing rapidly.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very young market. We might draw things from other markets&quot; including the United States. &quot;The advertising industry in Latin America is only just now finding its own identity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Agulla said Ammirati Puris Lintas, another agency network owned by Interpublic, had been interested in a partnership with Agulla &amp; Bacetti, but Lowe had provided a better fit.</p>
