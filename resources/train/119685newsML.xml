<p>U.S. prices data released on Wednesday came in right on target but failed to provide the impetus to kick stock markets back on to a record path.</p>
<p>Stock, bond and equity markets had been on hold ahead of the U.S. consumer figures for September, which could have jolted investors if they had showed inflation picking up more than expected.</p>
<p>In the event, the U.S. Labour Department said consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent, following an increase of 0.1 percent in August.</p>
<p>The inflation numbers have been closely watched by price- sensitive bond markets and high-flying stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>But the numbers steadied European stock markets only briefly and profit-taking took hold again as Wall Street turned lower after a modestly firm start.</p>
<p>By 1415 GMT the Dow Jones Industrials index was down almost 25 points at 5,980.</p>
<p>London stocks, already pressured by downbeat economic news, perked up only for a short while before resuming their decline.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading shares was down nearly 27 points by mid-afternoon after stronger-than-expected unemployment and earnings numbers, together with a strong rise in public borrowing weighed on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The (British) figures were disappointing for the bulls but shouldn't come as a surprise for anyone in the real world. The economy can't be the best in Europe and be immune from falling unemployment,&quot; said SocGen strategist Andy Hartwill.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is being driven by the perpetual hope that interest rate increases are something you read about in fairy stories rather than happen in the real world.&quot;</p>
<p>French stocks pared some of their losses in early afternoon trading after the U.S. data, but the impact was only temporary and by 1415 GMT the CAC-40 index was off 15 points at 2,152.</p>
<p>The shares of defence companies Lagardere, Thomson and Thomson-CSF were suspended after the government announced its preference for Lagardere bid for Thomson.</p>
<p>German shares closed bourse dealings lower as players took profits following record highs reached on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The DAX index of Germany's 30 leading shares ended down 13.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,714.90, retreating from the record high of 2,728.64 reached briefly on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We could be ready for a bit of a pause at the moment. But even if it goes down one percent, it's not really serious,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The dollar came back from levels reached in early European trade, slipping below 1.54 against the mark but it was bid against the yen at around 112.20 yen</p>
<p>Traders were cautious of where the dollar was likely to go after the U.S. data, but sterling settled above 2.44 marks following its recent sizzling performance.</p>
<p>On oil markets, benchmark November Brent crude was trading just around $24.80 a barrel, having traded a little under six-year highs on Tuesday.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1415 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.5383 marks and 112.14 yen, compared with 1.5394 marks and 112.29 yen in late European business on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1415 GMT</p>
<p>London - The FTSE index was down 26.8 points at 4,024.0.</p>
<p>Frankfurt - The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt ended bourse trade down 13.55 at 2,714.90. In post-bourse computerised trade, the IBIS DAX was down 10.56 at 2,708.17.</p>
<p>Paris - The CAC-40 share index was down 15.59 points at 2,152.69. PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed firmer at $381.50 against $380.80 in the morning and $381.00 on Tuesday afternoon. Silver was up three cents at $5.06.</p>
