<p>French skier Adrien Duvillard, seriously injured in a training crash for a World Cup downhill on Friday, came out of his coma overnight and was said to be in a stable condition.</p>
<p>Doctors at the Berne hospital where Duvillard was taken upgraded his condition from serious to stable on Saturday and reported he had full movement of both his arms and legs.</p>
<p>Duvillard, who also suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung in the accident, will remain in hospital for seven to 10 days for observation and tests.</p>
<p>He lost control on the final turn of the Lauberhorn course, at 4,260 metres the longest on the World Cup circuit, and crashed at the same spot where Austrian Gernot Reinstadler was killed six years ago.</p>
<p>The Frenchman was unconscious when he was flown to hospital at Interlaken where he was placed in a drug induced coma before undergoing a brain scan and then transferred to Berne.</p>
