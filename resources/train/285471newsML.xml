<p>Wall Street stocks stormed higher on Friday, in a session that saw top-tier technology shares stage a powerful rally and blue chips post their sixth sharpest rise in history.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed unofficially at 6544.09, for a gain of 101.60 points, or roughly 1.6 percent.</p>
<p>If official, the session would rank as the sixth highest point gain in the history of the average.</p>
<p>Even with the fierce rally, the Dow's rise was no match in percentage terms to that on the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite.  </p>
<p>There, new optimism about the economy and an improving outlook for semiconductor companies produced a 30.06 point rise in the Nasdaq Composite to 1310.76, a 2.35 percent surge.</p>
<p>Analysts said the sharp turnaround in stock prices, which reversed nearly all the Dow's losses for the week, showed equity investors had shaken off the jitters that a series of strong economic indicators had injected into the bond market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's renewed confidence the economy is still going to grow moderately and you're seeing that clearest in the techs,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities.  </p>
<p>Analysts also noted that a flood of cash from sources like annual retirement account contributions was now finding its way into the market and likely helped fuel the rally.</p>
<p>&quot;Fund managers have got to put that money to work,&quot; said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. &quot;Today, that decision was easy. Companies like Cisco and Intel and Microsoft got the money.&quot;</p>
<p>Intel Corp was by far Nasdaq's most active issue, leaping eight points to 138-3/8 on volume of 11.9 million shares.  </p>
<p>Intel was on the receiving end of a wave of good feeling on Wall Street. Salomon Brothers upgraded the shares to strong buy from hold, citing expectations the company would beat fourth quarter earnings estimates.</p>
<p>The shares also got a boost when Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak cited Intel as one of the chip companies likely to perform best during what he expects will be a broad industry recovery in 1997.</p>
<p>Intel's rally quickly spread across the tech sector. International Business Machines Corp jumped 5-7/8 to 159-1/8 and Microsoft Corp rose three to 84-5/8.  </p>
<p>Analysts saw signs of pent-up demand in the buying binge.</p>
<p>&quot;There had been a lot of buyers just waiting, especially on the big name techs,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. &quot;They just needed something to get them off the fence.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike Thursday, when a late rally was largely contained to blue chip issues, the latest leg of the rally showed much more broad support, with NYSE advancing issues running ahead of declining issues by about five-to-two on heavy volume of about 451 million shares.  </p>
<p>The rally wiped out a 101.10 point loss registered on the Dow on New Year's Eve and narrowed blue chips' losses to a slender 17 points on the week.</p>
<p>Among individual issues, State Street Boston Corp jumped 8-1/8 to 71 on takeover speculation set off by news Bank of New York Corp was seeking approval to increase its stake in the company. Bank of New York rose 7/8 to 34-1/8.</p>
<p>Filenet Corp tumbled 8-1/8 to 23-5/8 after warning that its fourth quarter earnings would fall well below year-ago levels because of customer order delays.  </p>
<p>Computer chip maker Micron Technology Corp was the NYSE's most active issue, rising 2-3/8 to 32. The company was among those recommended by Merrill analyst Kurlak.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 11.02 to 748.03.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 29.98 to 1310.68. The gain was second only to a 33.18 point rise posted on July 17, 1996.</p>
<p>(Figures official as of 1645 EST/2145 GMT).</p>
