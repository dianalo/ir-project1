<p>A young Spanish politician who was shot twice in the head after being kidnapped by Basque separatist guerrillas died of his wounds on Sunday, hospital officials said.</p>
<p>Miguel Angel Blanco, a low-ranking member of Spain's ruling party, was found bound and bleeding on a roadside on Saturday only hours after Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar led a demonstration of half a million people demanding his release.</p>
<p>Blanco had been in a deep coma with two bullets lodged in his brain. Doctors believed his case was so hopeless that they decided against operating on him.</p>
<p>Just before dawn on Sunday, Blanco -- a 29-year-old Basque town councillor -- was declared &quot;clinically brain dead&quot;, said Doctor Garcia Urra, of the San Sebastian hospital's intensive care unit.</p>
<p>&quot;It's incomprehensible, horrible,&quot; Pedro Luis Arias, spokesman for the Gesture For Peace group, told state radio.</p>
<p>Incensed by the fatal attack on Blanco, protesters in Pamplona clashed early on Sunday with police protecting the offices of Herri Batasuna, political arm of the Basque ETA guerrilla movement, a witness said. There was no immediate word on arrests or injuries.</p>
<p>ETA kidnapped Blanco on Thursday and vowed to kill him at 4 p.m. (1400 gmt) on Saturday unless the government transferred hundreds of ETA inmates to prisons in the Basque country. Government officials said they would never give in to blackmail.</p>
<p>Soon after the deadline passed, a hunter heard gunshots in a wooded area outside San Sebastian and found Blanco dumped on a country lane.</p>
<p>Blanco's ordeal touched a raw nerve among Spaniards, who in recent months have faced a growing wave of violence by the rebels. ETA has killed nearly 800 people in its 29-year fight for independence.</p>
<p>In a series of marches and rallies, hundreds of thousands of Spaniards turned out across the country on Saturday in a show of solidarity with Blanco and in opposition to ETA. Aznar led the largest demonstration in the Basque city of Bilbao.</p>
<p>Protests continued into the early hours on Sunday, with large crowds taking to the streets in over a dozen cities. In central Madrid, more than 50,000 people chanted &quot;Murderers! Murderers!&quot;</p>
<p>The news of Blanco's death before dawn on Sunday hit members of his family hard. &quot;There was a very strong reaction, above all from the mother, sister and girlfriend,&quot; Urra said.</p>
<p>The family had already had to endure an earlier mistaken announcement that he was dead.</p>
<p>Blanco was ETA's 10th killing this year. Of the 77 people it has kidnapped in its history, ETA has set deadlines to execute hostages only twice before, and in both cases it carried out its threat.</p>
<p>The front pages of Spain's Sunday newspapers brimmed with anger. &quot;Sons of Bitches,&quot; declared a headline in Diario 16. &quot;Beasts!&quot; said another in the YA newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;The government expresses its strongest condemnation against this barbarity,&quot; government spokesman Miguel Angel Rodriguez said earlier after Blanco had been shot.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, unidentified attackers firebombed an office belonging to Herri Batasuna in Blanco's hometown of Ermua, but little damage was caused.</p>
<p>Organisers of Pamplona's world-famous running of the bulls suspended the festival on Saturday in support of Blanco. It was the first such interruption since 1978 when it was cancelled after clashes between police and Basque nationalist demonstrators.</p>
<p>Basque political parties planned to meet on Sunday to discuss a response to ETA's action. The government called a meeting of a multi-party anti-terrorist group on Monday.</p>
<p>Authorities said Blanco was probably targeted because he was a member of the ruling centre-right Popular Party but, as a low-level official, was not protected by bodyguards.</p>
<p>In Blanco's hometown, people wept in the streets on Saturday afternoon when officials announced he had been found dead. Less than an hour later, word came through that he had survived the attack but was in an extremely critical condition.</p>
<p>After the shooting, Basque nationalist leader Jose Antonio Ardanza angrily criticised ETA's political wing. &quot;It's time for (ETA) to be denounced publicly. Herri Batasuna, you always want to be presented as victims in this society but you are the executioners,&quot; Ardanza told a news conference.</p>
<p>ETA is seeking an independent Basque state encompassing parts of northern Spain and southern France.</p>
