<p>German call money rates were mostly unchanged in midday dealings on Monday at about three percent, the same level as on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said market liquidity appeared adequate as many players were believed to be ahead in their monthly reserve holdings and few expectations for troubles in meeting demands.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank on Monday announced a 15-day tender due to the month ending on a Wednesday -- the usual tender day -- and Thursday's national holiday.</p>
<p>About one billion marks was expected in the allocation on Tuesday after a 12-day tender for 59.9 billion marks expires.  </p>
<p>&quot;There shouldn't be much tension about the month-end reserve requirements,&quot; one trader said. &quot;There may not even be Lombard borrowings.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bundesbank said on Monday that reserves as of Friday stood at 41.3 billion marks, about the same as Thursday's level at 41.4 billion marks.</p>
<p>The monthly average as of Sunday was unchanged at 41.1 billion marks, while Lombard borrowings were negligible.</p>
