<p>Germany's Bernhard Langer</p>
<p>survived a double bogey at his jinx hole on Sunday to win the</p>
<p>$500,000 Alfred Dunhill Masters and end a frustrating, 13-month</p>
<p>barren spell.</p>
<p>The double U.S. Masters champion shot a final round 65 for a</p>
<p>17-under-par total of 267 to take the $94,735 first prize in the</p>
<p>Australasian PGA and Asian PGA co-sanctioned event.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Langer, whose last win was the European</p>
<p>Open, won by two strokes from South Korea's Kang Wook-soon, who</p>
<p>had a last round 66, with overnight leader Scott Laycock of</p>
<p>Australia a further stroke adrift after a closing 71.</p>
<p>Langer started the day two shots behind Laycock but four</p>
<p>consecutive birdies from the third hole put him in the driving</p>
<p>seat. The German, winner of the 1991 Hong Kong Open on this</p>
<p>course, added birdies at the eighth and ninth to reach the turn</p>
<p>in 30.</p>
<p>But at the par-three 15th, where he shot a triple bogey six</p>
<p>on Saturday, he dropped two shots to put himself level with</p>
<p>playing partner Kang. A birdie at the next, with the Korean</p>
<p>bogeying, restored Langer's two-shot cushion.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good to win again and nice to know I can succeed with</p>
<p>the long putter. I putted very well, I do not think I can putt a</p>
<p>great deal better,&quot; said the world number 15, who used a</p>
<p>broomhandle putter.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not care what the putter looks like -- you do not get</p>
<p>paid for looking good. People laughed when I started to putt</p>
<p>crosshanded in 1982 but that did not bother me (either).</p>
<p>&quot;After the double bogey on 15 I said to my caddy that we</p>
<p>would have to start over again and I hit a birdie right away. I</p>
<p>am pleased with the way I played.&quot;</p>
<p>Kang, who has won twice on the Asian PGA Omega Tour this</p>
<p>year and leads the order of merit, said: &quot;I thought I had a</p>
<p>chance after the 15th but I was too aggressive at the next hole</p>
<p>and my approach went through the back (into a bunker) and I took</p>
<p>a bogey.&quot;</p>
<p>European number one Colin Montgomerie, unhappy with his form</p>
<p>all week, slumped to a five-over-par 76 including a quadruple</p>
<p>bogey at the fourth where he incurred three penalty strokes. He</p>
<p>drove into a ditch and after taking a penalty drop moved the</p>
<p>ball.</p>
<p>The Scotsman finished the tournament in joint 39th spot on</p>
<p>one-under-par 283.</p>
<p>World number three Ernie Els closed with a 68 for a</p>
<p>10-under-par total of 274 while Seve Ballesteros of Spain was</p>
<p>six shots further behind after a closing 73.</p>
