<title>UK: Fate of Iraq barrels overshadows Med crude value.</title>
<headline>Fate of Iraq barrels overshadows Med crude value.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-16</dateline>

<p>Uncertainty over the timing of fresh Iraqi exports remained centre stage in a quiet Mediterranean crude oil market early on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>The value of Russian Urals was seen virtually hostage to difficulties besetting U.N. and Iraqi officials trying to agree details of the programme's second 180 day period, they said.</p>
<p>While much inter-trader business in Urals was conducted at around a $1 discount to international benchmark Dated Brent last week, refiners continue to value the grade at a weaker discount of $1.10/$1.15.</p>
<p>&quot;The big question remains the Iraqi barrels,&quot; a trader at a southern European major said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Iraqi barrels are still out by the start of July then the sitation of Urals will be tighter. At the moment Urals is the only spot sour choice. Iranian Heavy is sold out until July 15 and Kirkuk just is not there. So the market depends very much on that (Iraq).&quot;</p>
<p>Another trader said: &quot;Refiners are waiting for prices to come down a little bit. They feel the last levels are not the real one. Of course, if Kirkuk should not appear for a few weeks the situation will change.&quot;</p>
<p>Many traders are not expecting first liftings of Iraqi Kirkuk under the second term of the United Nations oil-for-food agreement to start until July.</p>
<p>And uncertainty looks likely to persist amid continuing friction between U.N. and Iraqi officials in Baghdad.</p>
<p>The U.N. Special Commission in charge of destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction has recently complained twice to the Security Council about Iraqi interference with U.N. helicopter flights during the inspection of several Iraqi facilities at the beginning of this month and on Thursday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>The council deplored on Friday what it called unacceptable interference by Iraq with the flight of U.N. helicopters and told Baghdad to take immediate steps to halt such actions.</p>
<p>The council is likely to adopt a formal resolution when it is expected next week to deal with the commission's second complaint that Iraq had barred U.N. teams from two suspected military sites on Thursday and a third location on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In West African market, traders dismissed talk of loading disruption in Nigeria caused by tribal clashes in the oil town of Warri, where the Nigerian division of oil giant Royal Dutch Shell Group has its western division operational headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we are concerned there are no production problems,&quot; a Shell trader said.</p>
<p>Asian demand is seen continuing healthy on the back of a narrowed Brent/Dubai spread that has in effect lowered the value of West African crudes priced against dated Brent.</p>
<p>Bonny Light was assessed at a premium of about 25 to 35 cents over Dated Brent, with Qua Iboe at about 20/30 cents.</p>
<p>A Forcados loading July 5-6 moved at eight cents over Dated on Thursday but some traders said they saw the price as slightly on the low side.</p>
