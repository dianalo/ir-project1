<p>In the latest round of realignment in the telecommunications sector, Japan's biggest international operator, KDD, announced on Monday a broad business partnership with domestic long-distance carrier DDI Corp.</p>
<p>Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co and DDI said they would start offering seamless phone services in October combining their long-distance and international services under a unified brand.</p>
<p>The rates for the new service, to be offered to individual users through a Japanese unit of KDD, will be about 20 percent lower than those of their competitors, a KDD spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>KDD and DDI will offer the service to individual users by connecting to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp's (NTT) local call networks.</p>
<p>KDD and DDI are also discussing joint investment plans and the development of new Internet and multimedia services, but details have not yet been worked out, she said.</p>
<p>However, KDD denies speculation it plans to merge with DDI.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategy is to join hands with different partners in different business areas,&quot; a KDD spokeswoman said, adding that KDD is in talks on business tie-ups with other Japanese long-distance operators, including Toyota Motor Corp affiliate Teleway Japan Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not considering a merger with DDI for the time being,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>KDD will start offering domestic leased line service for corporate users later in July, its first move into the huge domestic phone market since the firm was established in 1953.</p>
<p>Last year it said it was considering forming business partnerships with telecom affiliates of electric power utilities, which offer long-distance services to a small group of corporate users via fibre-optic networks.</p>
<p>Japan's telecom industry shake-up was sparked earlier this year by deregulation measures that freed telecom titan Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) to move into international services.</p>
<p>Taking its cue from the liberalisation drive, another long-distance operator, Japan Telecom Co, wasted no time announcing a plan to merge with ITJ Corp, a small international operator, stirring speculation that their competitors would immediately follow suit in order to survive.</p>
<p>A Japan Telecom spokesman said the company's scheduled merger with ITJ on October 1 would allow it to offer services at rates lower than those of the KDD-DDI group.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll certainly offer more than a 20 percent discount (to current rates),&quot; a Japan Telecom spokesman said.</p>
<p>NTT, for its part, will launch an international service in September.</p>
