<p>Firefighters were close to controlling a series of devastating wildfires in southern California on Thursday but feared hot desert winds over the weekend could spark more blazes.</p>
<p>Fire crews mopped up as the main Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu and roads through the Santa Monica mountains opened to rush-hour traffic after three days. The wind-blown wildfires erupted on Monday from the movie star colony of Malibu to mountains along the Mexican border, destroying or damaging more than 100 homes, injuring 11 people and burning some 35,000 acres (14,000 hectares) of land.</p>
<p>Firefighters said the blaze in Malibu, which burned nearly 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares), was 80 percent contained on Thursday morning and there were no more flames. The huge fire that destroyed 80 homes further south near the town of Carlsbad was expected to be fully contained by Thursday evening, the California Department of Forestry said.</p>
<p>Firefighters said a blaze near the Mexican border at Otay Mountain was 50 percent contained. No homes were threatened.</p>
<p>Despite gaining the upper hand, authorites were bracing for a possible flare-up at the weekend, when hot Santa Ana winds were expected to kick up again.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point it appears that Saturday and Sunday will be the peak of the Santa Ana event,&quot; the National Weather Service said. It predicted winds of 30-40 mph (48-64 kph) with gusts of more than 60 mph (96 kph).</p>
<p>One fireman seriously burned on Tuesday when a wall of flames jumped a road in a canyon north of Los Angeles was to undergo surgery on Friday. He suffered burns over 60 percent of his body and respiratory problems.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, President Bill Clinton declared portions of California a disaster area because of the wildfires. &quot;Due to the devastating effects of the Southern California fires, I am declaring that a major emergency exists in the state,&quot; he said in a statement issued by the White House.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result, federal funds will begin to flow immediately to the people and communities ... affected by this tragedy,&quot; Clinton said. The action makes federal aid available to Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties.</p>
<p>A troublesome fire in the scenic Big Sur area on the central California coast grew to 2,750 acres (1,100 hectares) on Thursday, forcing the evacuation of campers from Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and of guests from the Big Sur Lodge in the park, officials said.</p>
<p>Firefighters thought they had the fire almost contained earlier this week, but it jumped fire lines and spread quickly in rugged, inaccessible forest and brush. It was only 25 percent contained on Thursday, said Juanita Freel, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be really difficult to get a handle on. This area is very notorious for that,&quot; Freel said.</p>
<p>Some 1,884 firefighters were battling the blaze, burning about 150 miles (240 kms) south of San Francisco. Strike teams were protecting homes that could be threatened by the fire, Freel said. So far, only one travel trailer has been destroyed and two firefighters have been injured, she said.</p>
