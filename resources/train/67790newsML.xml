<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, outlining Moscow's vision of post-Cold War European security, said on Friday stationing NATO's military might closer to Russia's borders was &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot;.</p>
<p>Primakov, who was due to meet NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana in the Austrian capital at 1430 GMT, said Moscow was aware it had no right of veto if former Soviet bloc members wanted to join the Western military alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;However, Russia finds it absolutely unacceptable that NATO's military infrastructure should come closer to its territory,&quot; he said in an address to the Vienna-based Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>
<p>Moscow's outright opposition to NATO expansion relaxed a notch following President Boris Yeltsin's victory in presidential elections in June. Primakov then suggested a limited expansion of NATO to the east may be acceptable if no troops or weapons were stationed inside the new member states.</p>
<p>Ex-Warsaw Pact states the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are front-runners to join NATO, probably next year. Slovenia said on Friday it also had a good chance of joining the 16-member alliance in the first wave of new members.</p>
<p>Setting out Russia's ideas for a pan-European security framework, Primakov said Europe, together with its partners in North America, had to grasp the chance to set up new structures otherwise new lines of division based on military alliances would emerge across the continent.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, a trend toward this eventuality does exist. In our opinion, the intention to expand NATO to the east will reinforce it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Primakov said the 53-member OSCE, which includes most of Europe, the United States and Canada, was uniquely positioned to be bolstered into Europe's main security body.</p>
<p>&quot;The model should envisage counteraction against an entire range of threats, both military and terrorist, as well as challenges in the economic, ecological, humanitarian and other fields,&quot; Primakov told OSCE ambassadors.</p>
<p>Primakov went on to suggest that all organisations involved in security policy should have an input in a restructured OSCE -- the United Nations, NATO, the Council of Europe, the European Union, the Western European Union (the EU's defence arm) as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).</p>
<p>Russia is expected to press for the proposals to be seriously addressed at the OSCE's summit in Lisbon in December as a balance, or alternative, to further NATO expansion, diplomatic sources said.</p>
<p>The Russian foreign minister said he hoped a treaty to set up the new body would be ready at the next OSCE summit in 1998.</p>
<p>Primakov made no reference in his speech to proposals put forward by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier this month to draw up a new charter defining NATO's ties with Russia or an enhanced Partnership for Peace programme to include countries not accepted into the alliance in the first wave of new entrants.</p>
<p>Following talks with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky earlier, Primakov said he hoped Austria would not give up its neutrality and join NATO but stressed such a move was solely a matter for the Austrian people.</p>
<p>During the Cold War, the Kremlin had insisted that Vienna should remain neutral, a commitment it made to ensure Moscow pulled its World War Two occupying forces out of Austria in 1955.</p>
