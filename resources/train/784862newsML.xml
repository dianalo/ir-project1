<p>Asia's light crudes traded at higher levels, as refiners actively looked to cover their September requirements, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>September Belida was sold by a shosha to a European major at ICP +40 cents per barrel.</p>
<p>This is higher than a Belida trade done by another shosha earlier this week at ICP +30 and the +20 cents trades seen in early August.</p>
<p>September trading for Indonesian crudes normally start only when the monthly allocations are announced in the middle of August.</p>
<p>But limited availabilities of other light crudes have prompted buyers to emerge earlier this time, to prevent being caught short.</p>
<p>The firmness in Belida prices led Malaysia to move up its offer price of September Tapis, to APPI +20/25 cents from an earlier offer of APPI +15.</p>
<p>Trading on Australian crudes was thin, although a producer confirmed selling another September Cossack cargo at Tapis APPI -57 cents.</p>
<p>The seller had acquired this cargo from a shosha last week at Tapis APPI -80. The last Cossack trade was by the same seller to China at Tapis APPI -60.</p>
<p>A late September North West Shelf (NWS) condensate was also confirmed bought by a European trader who was heard to have accumulated a large volume of NWS condensate to take to its refinery in Australia.</p>
<p>The direction of the heavy crude market was less clear, with premiums discussed at varying levels.</p>
<p>August Minas was rumoured sold by a shosha at ICP +15 cents, the lowest levels seen since July.</p>
<p>At least one shosha is still looking to sell August Minas, although the volume was small, around 100,000 barrels.</p>
<p>But an equity producer sold August Duri on Wednesday at ICP +80, was offering September Minas at ICP +60.</p>
<p>Minas was trading around 40 cents per barrel under Duri in July and early August.</p>
<p>The Middle East crude market remained lacklustre.</p>
<p>Rumours that a European major had sold a September Masila to a South Korean refiner at OSP -45 cents was denied by the refiner.</p>
