<title>USA: CME lumber futures end limit down on weak cash.</title>
<headline>CME lumber futures end limit down on weak cash.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Continued weakness in cash lumber markets, despite a sharp rise in February housing starts, kept CME lumber futures pressured, with nearbys ending down the daily limit of $10.00 per tbf, traders said.</p>
<p>May closed limit down at $359.50 and July limit down at $355.50 with other months ending $7.50 to $9.60 lower.</p>
<p>Cash markets showed only a brief period of demand after Tuesday's February U.S. housing starts report, despite starts surging 12.2 percent, and cash prices have again pointed lower. There is also concern more wood will come from Canada after April 1 when the new quota year starts, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite a bullish housing report we have a pathetic cash market and that is what affected futures all day,&quot; said Curt Cunningham, President Pacific Futures Trading.</p>
<p>&quot;Cash was only busy for about an hour yesterday and no one was able to raise prices. In fact, some 2X4s traded below $370 late in the day yesterday,&quot; Cunningham added.</p>
<p>Random Lengths quoted cash spruce at $376, down $1 from both Friday and the last midweek quote.</p>
<p>Further losses are seen Thursday as 80 cars remained unsold in May and the synthetic pointed to at least another $6 loss at the close, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Technicians noted there is no technical support to about another $9 lower in May.</p>
