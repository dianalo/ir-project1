<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat could hold a landmark meeting on Monday if talks between their negotiators are successful, an authoritative source said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have bridged some gaps and if they finalise arrangements this morning, the meeting might even be today,&quot; the source told Reuters.</p>
<p>Asked to confirm the report, Netanyahu's office said: &quot;No meeting has been set at the moment and we have no additional information.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat told reporters in self-rule Gaza he was not certain when the meeting would take place.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been meetings...between Saeb Erekat and Dore Gold yesterday and today but until now we have not reached common ground. We hope to reach common ground,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>Erekat is head of the Palestinian negotiating team. Gold is Netanyahu's political adviser.</p>
<p>The source said talks between the two sides that went into the early hours of Monday in a Tel Aviv apartment under the auspices of U.N. special envoy Terje Larsen were to resume at 1000 GMT at an undisclosed location. It was not immediately possible to confirm that the meeting had begun.</p>
<p>A Netanyahu spokesman said Israel's talks strategy team -- Netanyahu, Foreign Minister David Levy and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai -- was meeting in Jerusalem on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Netanyahu was elected in May. Last week, Israeli-PLO relations sank to their lowest point since he took office.</p>
<p>Arafat launched a general strike in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Thursday after saying Netanyahu's decision to expand Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank was tantamount to a declaration of war on the Palestinians.</p>
<p>The source said Gold and Erekat were trying to draft a joint communique which would pave the way for an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting immediately after. He said conceptual rather than procedural differences divided the two sides.</p>
<p>A PLO official told Reuters that Arafat had discussed the draft communique with senior officials and proposed amendments.</p>
<p>Another PLO official said Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's intention to renegotiate a deal on a redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron agreed to by Israel's previous government. They demanded he move on all aspects of the peace deals.</p>
<p>&quot;We want a clear commitment from Netanyahu that he will implement the Oslo accords. We are arguing with the Israelis over their choice of words in the communique which shows they want to negotiate a new agreement,&quot; one PLO official said.</p>
<p>He said Palestinians would not rush the issue: &quot;We are not in a hurry. We will continue to negotiate until we get results.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu, elected on a platform of getting tough in peace talks, has resisted meeting Arafat, saying he would do so only out of Israeli security concerns.</p>
<p>A meeting with Netanyahu is important for Arafat, who risked his political life on the peace deal which Palestinians say has not yet delivered results.</p>
<p>But meeting Arafat poses a dilemma for Netanyahu, who is caught between the right-wing constituency that elected him and Arab and international pressure to advance peace moves.</p>
<p>A PLO official said the Palestinians had submitted a paper to the Israeli side demanding a halt to Jewish settlement, land confiscation and house demolitions in Arab East Jerusalem and West Bank areas still under Israeli security control.</p>
<p>The official said the paper also demanded immediate resumption of final-status peace talks last held before Israel's May 29 elections.</p>
