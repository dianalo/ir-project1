<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Czech parliament voted on Thursday to lift the parliamentary immunity of the head of the ultra-right Republican and two of his party colleagues, opening the way for a possible prosecution.</p>
<p>Deputies in the 200-seat lower house of parliament voted 94 to 66 to approve a request to allow police to investigate alleged anti-German remarks by Miroslav Sladek during a visit to Prague in January by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, parliament's press department said.</p>
<p>Sladek has been quoted in local media as telling his followers that &quot;we can only regret that we only killed a few Germans during the war&quot;. The remarks have been widely quoted, and never denied.</p>
<p>Sladek was reported to have made the statement at a demonstration on January 21 against the signing by Kohl and Czech Prime Minster Vaclav Klaus of a declaration aimed at healing old World War Two wounds.</p>
<p>In the declaration Germany expressed sorrow for the Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and the Czech side apologised for any brutality involved in the post-war expulsion of some 2.5 million ethnic Germans from the country.</p>
<p>The Republicans and Communists see the declaration as a betrayal of Czech interests, and tried in vain to block its approval by parliament earlier this month.</p>
<p>Sladek's party won eight percent of the popular vote in last year's lower house elections. Sladek himself was convicted of assaulting a public official and disobedience last year and was given a 10-month suspended sentence.</p>
<p>Two other Republican deputies, Josef Krejza and Rudolf Smucr, were also stripped of their immunity on Thursday. They may face charges for disrupting a Czech-German memorial meeting in the former Nazi concentration camp at Terezin in 1994.</p>
