<p>Small arms, mortar and rocket fire inside could clearly be heard inside Cambodia on Thursday as rival Cambodian factions fought for control of the last major stronghold of troops loyal to ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
<p>Thai army sources at this border post predicted the imminent fall of the border town of O'Smach, under siege by forces loyal to Cambodian strongman Hun Sen, and said they were preparing for an influx of refugees fleeing the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;The low morale and lack of ammunition and food supply has weakened the royalist force, and we predict that Hun Sen troops will capture O'Smach soon,&quot; a Thai major said.</p>
<p>However, royalist liaison officer Colonel Wan Na vowed to hold the town, saying Khmer Rouge soldiers were helping.</p>
<p>&quot;We will fight until the end because this is our last position,&quot; he shouted across the barbed wire to reporters.</p>
<p>He said Khmer Rouge fighters and royalist soldiers were fighting alongside each other against Hun Sen's forces at the frontline, about 10 km (seven miles) from O'Smach.</p>
<p>Journalists at the border, which is marked by barbed wire, said the fighting appeared to be closer as small arms fire was clearly audible. It was not possible to cross the border into Cambodia for independent confirmation.</p>
<p>Some of the mortar fire from Cambodia landed on the Thai side of the border, and the Thai major ordered his troops to fire a single mortar round back as a warning.</p>
<p>It was believed to be the first time that Thai forces had fired mortars in the area since Hun Sen's troops pushed back Ranariddh's soldiers to the area several weeks ago.</p>
<p>Forces loyal to Hun Sen have been inching their way toward O'Smach, and landed mortar rounds inside the town for the first time on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Their advance has been slowed by booby traps and landmines lain by the retreating forces of Ranariddh.</p>
<p>Since removing Ranariddh in a bloody coup on July 6, Hun Sen has battled the prince for diplomatic approval overseas while pushing the ragged remnants of his army to remote pockets of the country.</p>
<p>Only O'Smach and a few villages remain in the hands of forces opposing Hun Sen, some of them controlled by the rump of the Khmer Rouge guerilla group, which ruled Cambodia between 1975 and 1979.</p>
<p>Earlier, heavily-armed Thai troops reinforced the border to prevent the fighting from spilling over into Thailand and stop any uncontrolled flood of panicked refugees.</p>
<p>Some 15,000 refugees in the town were preparing to take refuge in Thailand and would be allowed to cross over when the situation warranted, Thai authorities said.</p>
<p>Local district chief Surat Kongthiam told Reuters he had contacted international relief agencies including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross to prepare emergency assistance.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been preparing the location to receive the influx of Cambodian people from O'Smach, and we estimate that not less than 20,000 will cross the border to seek refuge,&quot; Surat said.</p>
