<p>Tribesmen on Monday kidnapped a French diplomat in the Yemeni capital Sanaa and took him to the province of Marib where security officials are negotiating his release, security sources said.</p>
<p>They did not have details on the diplomat, but said security forces were in negotiation with the al-Toaiman tribe, whose armed members abducted the diplomat while he was driving his car in a Sanaa street.</p>
<p>&quot;The security forces are surrounding the (bases) of the tribe,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>&quot;Negotiations are underway to find out their demands and to secure the release of the diplomat. Members of other tribes are helping in the negotiations,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Another senior security official said security authorities planned &quot;at the same time to arrest members of the Toaiman tribe whether in Marib or Sanaa to put pressure on the kidnappers.&quot;</p>
<p>A French embassy official confirmed that a diplomat had been kidnapped, but refused to give any other details.</p>
<p>The Toaiman tribe earlier this month hijacked the car of Yemen's minister of agriculture and kidnapped his driver in Sanaa. The minister was not in the car at the time. The driver was beaten up and later set free.</p>
<p>The tribe demanded then that the government provide it with water pumps and drilling equipment for wells in Marib, 170 km (100 miles) north of Sanaa.</p>
<p>The security soruces believed the tribe still has the same demands.</p>
<p>In recent years, tribes in Yemen with grievances against the government or foreign oil firms have kidnapped tourists or foreigners working in Yemen for use as bargaining chips.</p>
<p>At least two diplomats, an American and the Saudi ambassador, have also been kidnapped.</p>
<p>The tribes' demands have usually involved land or water issues, and have rarely been political. There have been no reported casualties from the abductions.</p>
<p>Some of the kidnap victims, mostly Westerners, were rescued by security forces. Others were set free, but it was never officially confirmed if any demands were met.</p>
<p>In January, members of a tribe kidnapped 17 elderly French tourists in Marib but released them later in the month.</p>
