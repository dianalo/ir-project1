<p>Australian Opposition communications spokesman Chris Schacht said on Tuesday he expected all Australians would soon pay timed rates for data calls, regardless of whether they were for business or personal reasons.</p>
<p>Under telecommunications legislation passed by the Australian parliament on Monday, businesses would pay for local data calls, which included the transmission of faxes, e-mails and internet usage, from July 1 when deregulation takes effect.</p>
<p>Schacht said he was concerned small businesses would use home telephones for business purposes in order to avoid charge.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way around all of this is to actually put the timed rate on everybody for data,&quot; Schacht told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see that coming within a year or so from Telstra because they'll claim there is a loophole.&quot;</p>
<p>Australian Communications Minister Richard Alston said on Tuesday Australia would have one of the most liberalised and consumer-friendly telecommunications regimes in the world as a result of the new legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;This telecommunications legislative package fulfills the government's election commitment to bring about a new era of competition and to establish a world-class consumer protection framework,&quot; Alston said in a statement.</p>
<p>Australia took the first step towards telecommunications deregulation in the early 1990s when it allowed a single competitor to set up against the government-owned monopolist, Telstra Corp.</p>
<p>The then Labor government then allowed Vodaphone a third mobile telephone network and targeted July 1, 1997, as the beginning of completely open competition within the industry.</p>
<p>Alston's Liberal-National government last year set out the regulatory system for the new competitive regime, under which there would be no limit on the number of carrier licences issued and no restrictions on the services they could provide.</p>
