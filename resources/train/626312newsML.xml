<p>Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Russian President Boris Yeltsin were set to sign a friendship pact on Saturday after two years of delays caused by political wrangling between the two Slav states.</p>
<p>Kuchma and Yeltsin, who started his first state visit to Ukraine on Friday, are also expected to sign a broad political declaration and statements on the disputed Black Sea fleet and cooperation in space, the Kremlin spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an unprecedented visit,&quot; Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing in Kiev. &quot;I cannot remember any visit in the past where the president had such an impressive entourage,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over the shareout of the Black Sea fleet, Ukraine's energy debt, trade conditions and other issues which prevented them from signing the major treaty initialled in 1995.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Kuchma and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin agreed Russia would lease the Black Sea port of Sevastopol for 20 years for its part of the disputed fleet, settling the protracted row.</p>
<p>After three hours of talks in Kiev, Kuchma and Chernomyrdin also said they had solved most other problems and announced that the road to the summit meeting was open.</p>
<p>An upbeat Yeltsin demonstrated in Kiev that he was keen to heavily exploit common history and close family links which unite tens of millions of people in both countries.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin made a stop on his way from the airport to chat with people who gathered to greet him.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the members of my family have Ukrainian blood, my grandson has some Ukrainian blood,&quot; Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as telling people in reference to the son of his daughter Tatyana, who is married to an ethnic Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Some observers have suggested the new thaw in relations between Russia and Ukraine was encouraged by NATO's plans to expand eastwards, which rang alarm bells in Moscow.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Yeltsin headed off a looming confrontation with NATO by striking a deal which gave Moscow some say in the Western alliance in exchange for an unspoken assent to its plans to grant membership to some Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The closer the ties between Russia and Ukraine, the fewer the headaches in its (Russia's) relations with NATO,&quot; Yastrzhembsy said earlier on Friday.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky admitted there were still many tricky issues to solve in bilateral relations. He said Yeltsin would raise the problems of Russian language and culture in Ukraine with Kuchma.</p>
<p>Some influential Russian politicians say 12 million ethnic Russians are discriminated against in the country of 50 million.</p>
<p>But Yastrzhembsky and other senior members of the Russian delegation repeated several times that Russia was seeking something more than just normal relations with its neighbour.</p>
<p>&quot;We want brotherly relations with Ukraine rather than just good neighbourliness,&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov told his Ukrainian opposite number Hennady Udovenko.</p>
