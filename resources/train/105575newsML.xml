<p>France has vowed to crack down on Corsican separatists, but breaking hardened guerrillas with 20 years' experience will be far harder than tracking down young Islamist bombers who struck Paris last year, police say.</p>
<p>Despite gung-ho statements by ministers, police commanders on the lawless Mediterranean island know they face hundreds of heavily-armed gunmen with passive support in a population of 250,000 cowed by a longstanding habit of silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Just because we're fed up with the violence doesn't mean we are suddenly going to start informing for the police. Every family has a member with the nationalists,&quot; an unnamed Corsican interviewed by Europe 1 radio said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Public declarations of war from Paris after a weekend bomb attack on Prime Minister Alain Juppe's mayoral office in Bordeaux were accompanied by discreet orders to &quot;be selective&quot;.</p>
<p>France's top anti-terrorist magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere was put in charge of investigating the Bordeaux bombing. Inquiries are also pending into 15 murders or attempted murders and some 30 bomb attacks in Corsica.</p>
<p>Investigators say they have been encouraged to reactivate inquiries that had been dormant for several months, while the government held secret talks with the separatists, and speed up the prosecution of the few gunmen caught red-handed.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre compared his policy to police successes in ending a wave of Algeria-linked Islamist bombings in Paris last year, but police officers say Corsica is a much tougher nut to crack.</p>
<p>Asked on television why police did not round up publicly known leaders of the Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC), Ajaccio police chief Demetrius Dragacci said justice authorities needed proof, not just suspicions.</p>
<p>Police are accused by parliamentarians and the media of being soft on FLNC guerrillas who openly carry guns, extort &quot;revolutionary taxes&quot; and plant bombs almost nightly at public buildings on the island, but they say their task is delicate.</p>
<p>An authoritative source said Debre, fearing a bloodbath, refused a demand by Juppe for police to arrest hooded FLNC gunmen who fired a salvo at a member's televised funeral last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is armed in Corsica. You can't just have police wade into a funeral like that,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The FLNC was founded in May 1975, partly as a reaction against corruption in the island's old political establishment. Officially outlawed in 1983, it split into rival factions in the late 1980s and over the last two years, they have fought a bloody vendetta, in which at least 15 people have been killed.</p>
<p>Successive governments have alternated repression and negotiation with the separatists, who demand greater autonomy rather than total independence from France, a highly centralised state.</p>
<p>The main group, the Historic Wing of the FLNC, staged a show of strength before Debre visited the island in January. About 600 masked men and women, many armed with automatic weapons and bazookas, appeared at a night-time news conference in the hills.</p>
<p>Debre said a realisation of the deep roots and size of the movement explained his initial move to seek a solution through dialogue rather than repression.</p>
<p>Police estimate the FLNC probably has about 100 &quot;sleepers&quot; in mainland France who can be activated to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Since a car bomb attack in Bastia in July, the legal front organisations of the various factions have also started to go underground, fearing tit-for-tat sectarian reprisals.</p>
<p>Francois Santoni, the most prominent Historic Wing spokesman, has not been seen in public for weeks.</p>
<p>But in vitriolic editorials in his movement's weekly magazine, he has accused Juppe of anti-Corsican racism, blamed him for killing the &quot;peace process&quot; and warned that armed action is likely to be stepped up in the coming weeks.</p>
