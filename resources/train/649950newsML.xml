<p>Oregon became the 35th state to sue the tobacco industry Tuesday, accusing eight cigarette companies and other defendants with violating state racketeering and fraud laws.</p>
<p>Oregon Attorney General Hardy Myers also announced the state would join a settlement reached in March by other attorneys general with the Liggett Group, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd..</p>
<p>The settlement with Liggett requires the company to cooperate with Oregon and other states and to turn over 25 percent of its pretax income to the states for the next 25 years, which works out to about $10,000 to $20,000 a year for Oregon, Myers said.</p>
<p>Oregon's complaint, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland, charges the tobacco industry illegally targeted minors and made fraudulent claims in its in advertising, colluded to suppress research into the effects of smoking and unfairly profited from the alleged fraud.</p>
<p>Myers announced his intention to file the lawsuit last month and has been &quot;monitoring&quot; settlement talks between the industry and other state attorneys general.</p>
<p>Oregon is seeking repayment of state health care expenditures related to smoking-caused illness, as well as unspecified civil penalties and attorney fees.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Myers said total damages could run between $800 million and $1 billion.</p>
<p>The state also is seeking an order requiring the tobacco companies to disclose all research on the health effects of smoking, pay for a campaign encouraging people to stop smoking, and take all steps necessary to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.</p>
<p>Companies named as defendants in the Oregon lawsuit are Philip Morris Cos Inc.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.; Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., its parent company, B.A.T Industries Plc, and two former subsidiaries; United States Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc.; and Lorillard Tobacco Co., a unit of Loews Corp.</p>
<p>Also named are industry trade groups and representatives Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc., The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A. Inc., Smokeless Tobacco Council Inc. and Tobacco Institute Inc.</p>
