<p>South African oil exploration and production company Soekor said on Monday that pumping from its Oribi offshore field has been dealyed to April.</p>
<p>A statement said sea trials on its semi-submersible production rig Orca had started only on February 15.</p>
<p>The trials had been scheduled to begin 12 days earlier and there was no immediate explanation for the delay.</p>
<p>&quot;Orca is currently being towed to the Oribi field, 90 miles southwest of Mossel Bay, and is expected to arrive on site by the end of this week,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The necessary production and water injection facilities will then be installed with a view to commencing oil production during April,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Production was initially due to start this month but work on preparing the rig in Simonstown harbour was delayed by bad weather and labour trouble and the start date was put back to the end of March.</p>
<p>A legal dispute between contractors also delayed the departure of the rig from the harbour.</p>
<p>The rig is expected to pump 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) and the life of the field is estimated at between three and six years.</p>
