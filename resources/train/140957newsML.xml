<p>The Swiss National Bank's (SNB) central bank money supply aggregate was still growing above its target in September, but economists believe the SNB will continue to keep policy fairly expansive to help the economy.</p>
<p>Money supply growth exceeded the SNB's target in August and September, the first time in six years that growth has been above the target path, economists said.</p>
<p>But they also note that growth slowed in September from August, another factor weighing against any move toward a more restrictive policy.</p>
<p>The SNB is also seen keen to curb the strong Swiss franc, especially versus the mark, in order to boost exports. A move to a less expansive policy could have the adverse effect of strengthening the franc.</p>
<p>The SNB said on Thursday in a preliminary release of its monthly report that its money supply in September, on an annualised basis, rose 4.4 percent versus fourth quarter 1995.</p>
<p>CS Research analyst Christian Heyden noted that, based on the latest figures released this morning, money supply was still above the medium-term target but growth has slowed.</p>
<p>The SNB's medium-term target calls for growth in the monetary base of approximately one percent per year, a rate it says is compatible with stable prices. The current five-year &quot;medium-term&quot; period ends at the end of 1999.</p>
<p>Heyden said the central bank money supply level was 113 million Swiss francs above the target for medium-term growth in September. That was down from a level at 324 million Swiss francs above the target in August.</p>
<p>Walter Metzler, interest rate specialist at Union Bank of Switzerland, said the money supply level in September was 0.3 percent above the medium-term target, compared with a larger gap of 1.0 percent above the target in August.</p>
<p>Based on the longer-term target, Heyden said the latest growth trend was not worrisome.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will come back to the path,&quot; said Heyden. He said that unlike two other periods in the past two decades, when money supply growth was excessive, the economy this time did not appear to be in any danger of overheating.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not see the danger, as in the other periods. The economic situation is much different. In the other two expansive periods (with respect to money supply growth), we saw strong economic growth,&quot; Heyden said.</p>
<p>He added that consumer confidence is very low, and prospects that money supply growth will feed into inflation in Switzerland are slim. &quot;I think the potential for price increases is simply not there,&quot; Heyden said.</p>
<p>Despite the slower growth in central bank money supply last month, SNB policy still appears expansive, Metzler said.</p>
<p>The SNB, as expected, left its discount rate unchanged at 1.00 percent after its regular weekly board meeting. The rate was lowered from 1.50 percent on September 26.</p>
<p>Economists note the interest rate curve in Switzerland is relatively steep, and real short-term rates are also low.</p>
<p>&quot;The interest rate curve as well as real short-term rates ... show monetary policy is quite expansive,&quot; Metzler said.</p>
<p>The central bank money supply, comprising sight deposits held at the central bank and money in circulation, was reported at 31.353 billion Swiss francs in September. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340</p>
