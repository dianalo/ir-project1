<p>The United States on Friday criticised China's tactics during the U.N. Human Rights Commission saying that no country, especially a Security Council member, could put itself above the forum's scrutiny.</p>
<p>But Nancy Rubin, head of the U.S. delegation, said in a statement the &quot;global spotlight shone longer, more intensely and more critically on China's performance this year than in the past&quot;.</p>
<p>For the seventh year in a row, China averted censure by introducing a &quot;no-action motion&quot; to silence all debate on alleged repression and Western concern for political prisoners.</p>
<p>&quot;With the exception of China's no action motion, this has been a positive, active and successful Commission,&quot; Rubin said.</p>
<p>&quot;The no action vote was disappointing. It strikes at the heart of the Commission's effectiveness and threatens its many achievements. No nation, particularly a Security Council member, can put itself above the Commission's consideration,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The main U.N. human rights forum was to end its six-week session, having let China off the hook again, but keen to step up investigations in Africa, especially in Nigeria and Zaire.</p>
<p>The 53-member body approved a raft of resolutions condemning traditional transgressors, including Burma, Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Israel. It sent the toughest message to Indonesia to curb its alleged abuses in East Timor since a 1993 motion.</p>
<p>For the first time, the Commission urged states to consider abolishing capital punishment. It also adopted a resolution calling for a world conference by the year 2001 to combat racism, subject to approval by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The human rights group Amnesty International praised the Commission for having confronted Indonesia and Nigeria, but slammed it for ignoring abuses elsewhere: &quot;Once again, major human rights violators including Algeria, China and Turkey escaped scrutiny by the U.N. primary human rights body.&quot;</p>
<p>Amnesty accused some states who backed away from co-sponsoring a Western resolution on China of having bowed to commercial interests. Beijing then quashed Denmark's motion.</p>
<p>&quot;France's decision to block European Union consensus on China earned it applause from the Chinese government and confirmation of lucrative business contracts,&quot; Amnesty said. &quot;With millions of dollars on the line, any commitment to human rights principles just faded away.</p>
<p>&quot;For now, China has suppressed Commission scrutiny. This diplomatic victory was achieved through threats and bullying tactics and because countries like Australia, Canada, France, Gernmany, Greece, Italy and Spain put business before human rights,&quot; the group added.</p>
<p>Some 2,000 delegates heard more than 1,100 speeches and adopted 75 resolutions during the six-week session, according to Ralph Zacklin, acting U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, any state is concerned about what the rest of the world thinks about its human right practices,&quot; he told a final news conference.</p>
<p>Turning to Africa's Great Lakes region, Amnesty said the Commission was &quot;almost irrelevant&quot; in the face of &quot;some of the worst human rights abuses since the Second World War&quot;.</p>
<p>Yet the forum adopted a resolution urging Zaire's rebels and the government to support a U.N. investigation into alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees and civilians in the east.</p>
<p>Roberto Garreton, U.N. human rights investigator for Zaire, has accused the Tutsi-dominated rebels of massacring thousands of civilians and Rwandan Hutu refugees since December.</p>
<p>The resolution asked Garreton and the U.N. investigator on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to investigate the massacres and report to the General Assembly by June 30.</p>
<p>The Commission appointed its first investigator into alleged arbitrary detentions and executions in Nigeria. The resolution called on Lagos to &quot;release all prisoners, trade union leaders, human rights advocates and journalists currently detained&quot;.</p>
