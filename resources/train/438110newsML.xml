<p>The Chinese yuan closed up slightly at 8.2951 on Wednesday from Tuesday's 8.2952 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai, but trading was dull, dealers said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Tuesday was 8.2952.</p>
<p>Dealers said the yuan moved in a narrow range as it did on Tuesday given a lack of fresh market-moving news.</p>
<p>The yuan opened unchanged at 8.2952 and moved between 8.2951 and 8.2955 for most of the session, hitting an intraday high of 8.2942 and a low of 8.2957.</p>
<p>Trading was dull with most done at 8.2952, traders said.  </p>
<p>One dealer said no one seemed keen to trade beyond a small range around the 8.2950 level.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no reason to push the yuan up or down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A second dealer said the central bank took no action on the market, which added to traders' sense of caution.</p>
<p>He said he expected the yuan to continue to consolidate around 8.2950 on Thursday.</p>
<p>The yuan closed up at 6.7850 from 6.8204 against 100 Japanese yen and down at 1.0721 from 1.0705 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
