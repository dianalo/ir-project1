<p>Major Slovak shares were quiet in sluggish trading activity on the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Friday.</p>
<p>The 16-share official SAX index edged up 0.47 poinst to 168.42, boosted mainly by a slight increase in price of the steel maker VSZ which gained three crowns to close at 650.</p>
<p>Most other blue chips were little changed or did not trade.</p>
<p>Traders said disappointing first half results from some major firms including VSZ, oil and gas storage firm Nafta and major plastic pipe producer Plastika, on Friday failed to have any immediate effect on developments with their share prices.</p>
<p>But they did not rule out that lower profits could negatively influence prices of some of these shares in the near future after more details are available.</p>
<p>Overall volume fell to 260,995 shares from 399.241 stocks traded on Thursday. Turnover decreased to 171.30 million crowns from 180.1 million. Both volume and turnover were made up mostly of direct deals.</p>
