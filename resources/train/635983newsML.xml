<p>Colin Montgomerie will be seeking the consistency he will need at next week's U.S. Open when he plays in the European Grand Prix at Slaley Hall in northern England on Thursday.</p>
<p>As pleased as he was with his final round 64 in the lucrative British PGA Championship at Wentworth in his last event nine days ago, he was well aware that preceding it with a 76 was not the way to success at the Congressional Club near Washington in a week's time.</p>
<p>&quot;That final round at Wentworth was great for me,&quot; the Scottish world number six said. &quot;But I have to find much better consistency if I'm to get my first win of the year or have any chance in the U.S. Open.</p>
<p>&quot;The day before I shot the 64, the 76 virtually wiped out my chance of winning.&quot;</p>
<p>He blamed his putting for that bad round, just as he did for his disappointing form on the U.S. Tour in April - even though it was his putting that helped him win the European zone of the Andersen Consulting world championship before the PGA.</p>
<p>&quot;When I get that right, I can shoot 64s. It sends my confidence sky-high and I hope I can continue that at Slaley Hall, a course I've heard good reports of and where I hope I'll get good preparation for next week as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Montgomerie, who withdrew on the eve of last week's Tournament Players Championship in Hamburg &quot;for personal reasons', has another incentive this week.</p>
<p>He needs to kick-start his bid for a fifth European rankings title.</p>
<p>The PGA was his best finish in seven European events this year and the 33-year-old Scot has drifted to 20th in the current table, more than 276,000 pounds sterling ($451,000) behind leader Ian Woosnam, his main challenger last year.</p>
<p>South African Retief Goosen defends the title he won in a weaker field last year.</p>
<p>Included in a much stronger lineup this time is Italian Costantino Rocca, looking to revitalise his Ryder Cup season after some recent poor results including the halfway cut at last week's TPC event in Hamburg.</p>
<p>Ryder Cup captain Seve Ballesteros withdrew from the event officially on Monday after missing his eighth cut in 10 events this year in Hamburg.</p>
