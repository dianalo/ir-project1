<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>

<p>Italian debt markets languished in negative territory in late trade, with activity and turnover levels low and investors playing spreads between Italy and the UK, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We lost a bit on the spread with the Bund. There was a bit of technical weakness,&quot; one broker in London said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still seeing spread movement, with foreigners playing on the spread between Italy and UK markets,&quot; another broker at an Italian bank in London said.</p>
<p>The March Btp future on LIFFE was 20 basis points down at 130.88 after testing 130.70 support earlier.  </p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the government is trying to consolidate its position and then maybe open up on the centre-right,&quot; a broker said. But he noted the situation remained wide open, adding: &quot;At the moment it's all just talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, auctions of 18 and 24 month zero coupon certificates were covered about three times over, while gross yields at three, six and 12 month treasury bill auctions fell.</p>
<p>The Nov 2006 Btp was five bps off at 104.63 and yielding 7.20 percent, with a 163 basis point spread over the 10-year Bund. The most traded July 2006 Btp ended 13 bps off at 110.57.</p>
<p>The market was edgy ahead of a news conference earlier by Prime Minister Prodi. But Prodi said his centre-left coalition government was united on the need to tackle reforms to the welfare state. He needs to cut the public deficit to meet EMU goals but the Communist Refoundation party, whose support is vital to Prodi in parliament, is against social spending cuts.</p>
<p>Traders were watching the situation, after a raft of comments from ministers and the left and right.</p>
