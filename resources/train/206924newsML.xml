<p>Raging floodwaters caused a large section of Oregon's main north-south highway to collapse Thursday, creating a deep hole that was blamed for three truck accidents.</p>
<p>Oregon State Police Lt. Gregg Hastings said a 100-foot-long section of Interstate 5 in Roseburg collapsed about 1 a.m. (4 a.m. EST) under pressure from the rain-swollen South Umpqua River.</p>
<p>One truck with three trailers drove into the 30-foot-deep hole, but its driver escaped without injury, while a second tractor-trailer drove partly into the hole, causing minor injuries to the driver.</p>
<p>A third, more serious accident occured when the driver of a tractor-trailer veered to avoid the hole and struck a motorist who had gotten out of his pickup truck and was trying to get away from the scene.</p>
<p>The pickup driver, identified as Trampis Gress, 25, of Roseburg, had to have his foot amputated at a local hospital.</p>
<p>The highway was closed in both directions for about six hours after the accident until workers were able to open a single southbound lane. Workers were trying to open a second lane for northbound traffic but had no idea when the road might be repaired.</p>
<p>Roseburg, about 160 miles south of Portland, is in the heart of a three-county area where Gov. John Kitzhaber declared a state of emergency this week because of heavy rains and destructive mud slides that killed four people.</p>
