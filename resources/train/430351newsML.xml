<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 rubber offer prices were mixed in lethargic late trade on Monday with traders still waiting for buyers to enter the market.</p>
<p>Traders said benchmark SIR20 for April/May shipment fell 0.25 cents to 53.00 U.S. cents/lb fob Medan and Surabaya. Offer prices eased to 52.75 fob Padang from 53.00, but levels rose 0.25 U.S. cents to 52.50 fob Palembang.</p>
<p>In Pontianak, offer prices rose to 52.50 from 52.00 in the morning while in Jambi, levels fell 50 U.S. cents to 52.00. &quot;There are no fresh deals today. We are all frustrated because of this dull situation,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>Traders said they were willing to sell at the present prices but complained that buyers were difficult to find.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are buyers, we are willing to sell no matter how low the prices are. The problem is who wants to buy?&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said supply was tight because of the current wintering, but prices did not move in the absence of buyers.</p>
<p>Some said they suspected that major consumers such as the United States and Europe had already enough stock.</p>
