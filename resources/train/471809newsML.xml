<p>The Lima hostage crisis hit the 100-day mark on Thursday amid signs the government and Marxist rebels were close to reaching an accord to end the ordeal for the 72 hostages held at the Japanese ambassador's home.</p>
<p>Here is a chronology of the main events in the crisis:</p>

<p>Dec. 18 - The rebels threaten to kill their hostages unless the government frees about 400 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>Dec. 19 - Four ambassadors are released to be a &quot;communications channel&quot; between the rebels and the government.</p>
<p>Dec. 20 - Rebels free 38 hostages.</p>
<p>Dec. 21 - President Alberto Fujimori says he will study a non-violent &quot;way out&quot; if the rebels lay down their arms and free all hostages.</p>

<p>Jan. 12 - Palermo proposes a guarantors commission made up of the Red Cross and Vatican representative, Roman Catholic bishop Juan Luis Cipriani.</p>
<p>Jan. 17 - Rebels free an anti-terrorist police chief on medical grounds. Both sides agree on Canadian ambassador as third member of the guarantor commission.</p>
<p>Jan. 24 - Police armoured cars rumble past the occupied residence.</p>

<p>Jan. 27 - Rebels shoot at police making lewd gestures as they pass residence in armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>Feb. 10 - Rebels explode grenades and fire shots in response to police &quot;provocations.&quot;</p>
<p>Feb. 11 - Talks restart as rebel No. 2 Rolly Rojas and Palermo meet in safe house opposite residence.</p>
<p>Feb. 14 - Second round of talks is held to swap proposed agendas for future negotiations.</p>
<p>Feb. 15 - Third round of talks is held but yields no tangible results.</p>
<p>Feb. 17 - 62nd day of standoff, beating Latin America's previous longest hostage siege: 1980 61-day seizure of Dominican Embassy and 57 hostages in Bogota by M-19 rebels.</p>
<p>Feb. 20 - Cerpa joins talks for the first time in a fourth round of face-to-face negotiations.</p>
<p>Feb. 24 - Fifth round of talks reveals little sign of a quick breakthrough.</p>
<p>March 3 - Fujimori makes surprise trip to Cuba where President Fidel Castro offers to grant asylum to rebels if all sides agree. In Lima, an eighth round of talks is held.</p>
<p>March 5 - Ninth round of talks is held where the two sides exchange formal proposals.</p>
<p>March 6 - Cerpa suspends talks claiming security forces have built a tunnel under the residence ahead of attack.</p>
<p>March 9 - Rebels agree to return to negotiations.</p>
<p>March 10 - Government calls off round 10 of talks.</p>
<p>March 12 - Face-to-face talks resume but differences not resolved. No date is set for further talks.</p>
<p>March 18-20 Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura visits Peru, Cuba and the Dominican Republic. He receives formal agreements from Havana and Santo Domingo to give the hostage-takers asylum.</p>
<p>March 20-27 - Guarantors hold separate daily meetings with both sides to work out an acceptable deal.</p>
<p>March 27 - Fujimori says the sides are moving closer toward an agreement but that some problems still exist.</p>
<p>Diplomats and local media say a preliminary agreement is in place ahead of face-to-face talks expected early next week. The deal includes asylum in the Caribbean and pardons for some MRTA rebels imprisoned for minor offences, they say.</p>
