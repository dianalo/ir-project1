<p>Kazakhstan will take tough measures to attract funds from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to modernise its indebted railways, Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We support your proposal to raise tariffs and eliminate debts to make our railway network profitable...The government will offer its guarantees for the project,&quot; Kazhegeldin told a meeting with the bank's mission.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan -- a resource-rich former Soviet republic five times the size of France -- wants to use its geographical position as a transit link between Europe and Asia. Kazakhstan borders Russia, China and the other states of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Kazhegeldin said the government was planning to make the loss-making railways important contributors to the budget and the economy.</p>
<p>But first the railways must be radically restructured.</p>
<p>Bernard Ziller, EBRD senior banker in charge of the project, told Reuters after the meeting that the total cost of the project would amount to around $200 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Bank might go up to $100 million, and usually in big projects like railway restructuring we are cooperating with other financial institutions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the EBRD now expected the government to start resolving the arrears amassed by national railways.</p>
<p>Kazhegeldin told Ziller that the 12 billion tenge ($160 million) debts were incurred in recent years when clients preferred to pay not in cash but in kind.</p>
<p>&quot;The railways will now have to sell some of their assets to turn them into cash. We also insist that the railways must provide their services only for advanced payments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ziller said the government would take these steps over the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess by November-December this year we will finalise our negotiations to start practical work next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kazhegeldin said the restructuring would make it possible to preserve the 300,000 jobs of its workers.</p>
<p>EBRD officials said other projects with the Central Asian state would follow.</p>
<p>&quot;Kazakhstan is becoming increasingly important in the EBRD investment strategy,&quot; said Ferdinando Buffoni, EBRD Resident Representative in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The country has already attracted billions of dollars in investment commitments, but they are mostly in the potentially lucrative energy sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to attract investors not only in our promising oil and gas sector,&quot; Kazhegeldin said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investing in Kazakhstan must become as strong a habit as skiing in Switzerland,&quot; he said.</p>
