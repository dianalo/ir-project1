<p>Cotton ginner and marketer Queensland Cotton Holdings Ltd said it expected to maintain profitability in the current year ended February, 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very positive about our outlook. I expect we can maintain the level of profitability in the current year,&quot; Queensland Cotton chief executive Richard Haire told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said he was optimistic about the 1997 New South Wales crop and expected Queensland to maintain last year's production.</p>
<p>&quot;All the growth is coming out of New South Wales which recovered from the drought quicker than Queensland growers,&quot; Haire said.  </p>
<p>Queensland Cotton earlier reported a record net profit of A$13.26 million for the year ended February 28, 1997 compared with an $8.03 million net profit previously.</p>
<p>Haire said the crop in Queensland currently being picked would be about the same as last season.</p>
<p>He said Queensland Cotton was positive about continuing use of transgenic pest resistant cotton seed despite early criticism of its effectiveness by farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;An analysis in mid-February showed the new strains had led to a 68 percent drop in insecticide use,&quot; Haire said.  </p>
<p>Haire said farmers had been critical of the seed's effectiveness against insects because of early high expectations for the new strain.</p>
<p>&quot;Transgenic seed is critical but it is only a part of crop management,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cotton crop has to be managed well but we are continuing to finesse the technology,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said cotton prices were currently low and were expected to remain depressed for some time while there was an overhang in world stocks.  </p>
<p>&quot;I can't see any reason to be over-bullish about prices,&quot; Haire said.</p>
<p>Queensland Cotton was keen to expand its business &quot;but nothing in the way of acquisitions is in sight at present,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, there is a lot of interest by the United States in the Australian cotton industry,&quot; he said.</p>
