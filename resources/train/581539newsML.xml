<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Tame May expiration expected.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Tame May expiration expected.</headline>

<p>Over the last few months, expiration weeks have been the calmest weeks in options cycles, and traders said Wednesday that this expiration week is shaping up similarly.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know if you'll have any big gains coming off this,&quot; Jay Shartsis, head of options trading at R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co in New York, said, referring to expiration-linked gains.</p>
<p>&quot;The OEX (S&amp;P 100 index) will probably go out between 820 and 825,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The OEX was up 4.93 at 823.84 Wednesday afternoon, off its 826.14 session high.  </p>
<p>May options expire at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Jerry Hegarty, an analyst at Thomson Financial services, said early euphoria off the weaker than expected April producer price report Tuesday morning drove the OEX to its session high.</p>
<p>But he doubted whether that level would be breached again soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market's starting to hit some resistance overhead,&quot; he said. &quot;They're going to hang in there and close around these levels, at least through tomorrow afternoon.&quot;  </p>
<p>Shartsis said the market's resiliency Tuesday in the face of a sharp selloff in technology bellwether Intel Corp was noteworthy, but it is well overbought.</p>
<p>&quot;It's perhaps bullish that the market was able to contain a rather severe selloff in Intel and some related techs,&quot; he said. &quot;The market's intact. It's gone up a great deal.</p>
<p>&quot;A study of highly overbought markets indicates you flatten out for a while then you go up again,&quot; he added. &quot;That's probably what's going to happen here.&quot;</p>
<p>Turnover in May OEX options continued to be heavy, led by the 820 put, which traded more than 14,300 contracts.  </p>
<p>The OEX May 830 call traded about 11,300 contracts. The option, which had open interest of 10,168 through Tuesday, including an addition of 1,638 contracts, was up 1-3/8 at 4-1/4.</p>
<p>Overall OEX call and put volume was about even, with roughly 78,000 puts changing hands compared to 73,000 calls by mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>Put volume in the S&amp;P 500 index .SPX outpaced call volume by 61,000 to 44,000.</p>
