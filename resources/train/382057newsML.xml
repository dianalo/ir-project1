<p>The cash-strapped Brazilian government hopes to raise up to $24.5 billion by selling off property it does not use and in some cases does not even know it owns, an official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Helio Carlos Gehrke, the Finance Ministry official charged with looking after the government's diverse apartments, buildings, beaches and islands, told reporters he hoped to identify as federally-owned three million properties by the year 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, we have registered 500,000,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brazil has faced an uphill battle to rein in its spending and balance its books. It has introduced voluntary lay offs for federal employees and is privatizing state-owned companies.</p>
<p>Last year, officials revealed they had no idea how many buildings were federally owned and that the $280 million earned a year in rent by the government should probably be more like $2.0 billion.</p>
<p>Gehrke said occupants of property found to belong to the government would be allowed to buy it. They would pay land rent of 0.6 percent a year over the value of the property, raising some $1.45 billion a year for the government.</p>
<p>Gehrke said that by the year 2010, Brasilia expected to have made up to $24.5 billion selling 210,000 properties a year.</p>
