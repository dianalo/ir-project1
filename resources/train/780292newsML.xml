<p>Agricultural, energy and hardware group Wesfarmers Ltd said on Tuesday that growth in earnings in the current financial year would be at a slower pace than the 50 percent increase for 1996/97 ended June 30.</p>
<p>Most of the company's growth would come from existing businesses, managing director Michael Chaney told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll see reasonable growth this year,&quot; Chaney said.</p>
<p>Wesfarmers earlier reported a net profit of A$139.55 million, up from A$92.79 million a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Chaney said the company would look outside of existing businesses for growth, such as opportunities in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in India.</p>
<p>However, he rated as &quot;zero&quot; the company's chances of resurrecting its bid for ICI Australia Ltd. The bid, however, had created a A$3.6 billion warchest, which could potentially be used for outside acquisitions, Chaney said.</p>
<p>Chaney said there were opportunities in a vastly undersupplied LNG market in India, although the highly regulated nature of the industry could prove discouraging.  </p>
<p>Chaney also said the company's relatively low debt to equity ratio, currently in the low 20 percent range, left the company well-placed for growth.</p>
<p>Debt to equity should increase in the current year due to the company's earmarking of A$500 million for internal expansions, Chaney said.</p>
<p>This compared with expenditure of between A$100 million and A$300 million annually in previous years, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really spread across the curtain,&quot; Chaney said.  </p>
<p>Business to get significant cash injections for growth included the Bunnings retail hardware division, seen as a star performer this year, coal and fertilisers and chemicals, Chaney said.</p>
<p>Chaney said so far that it has not been keen to look offshore for acquisitions to promote growth at Wesfarmers.</p>
<p>&quot;What is being demonstrated is that so far it's not important in terms of achieving growth,&quot; Caney said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're managing to achieve adequate growth through expanding our existing businesses.&quot;  </p>
<p>By diversifying the company's assets, it is more likely Wesfarmers would continue to look mainly to grow its existing businesses, Chaney said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got a pretty good mix of businesses, whereas we used to be a lot narrower... It makes it more likely we'll expand than go into new areas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wesfarmers shares ended 51 cents higher at A$12.60 on Tuesday.</p>
