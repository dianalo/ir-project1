<p>Austria's ATX index ended 0.12 percent down on Friday as Bank Austria preference stock skidded 5.4 percent and its ordinaries fell to a record low.</p>
<p>Traders traced Bank Austria's slump to an unexpectedly low issue price for almost eight million new preference shares and a political spat over the bank's planned privatisation.</p>
<p>Bank Austria preferred finished 22.5 schillings down at 393.5 on unusually high turnover of 142,357 lots. Its ordinary shares were eight schillings down at a life-low of 757.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not surprising to see the price come off,&quot; said an analyst, who saw room for further declines in both stocks.</p>
<p>Earlier Bank Austria announced it had priced its new preference shares at 376 schillings each. Politicians continued to trade blows over a rights deal with German WestLB.</p>
<p>Preferred shares in Creditansatlt, taken over by Bank Austria in January, weakened 2.7 schillings to 478.</p>
<p>The overall market held up relatively well, however, supported by demand for high-grade steelmaker Boehler-Uddeholm and engineering group VA Technologie AG.</p>
<p>The ATX index closed 1.57 points lower at 1,305.35, with eight shares up, 12 down and one unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;This week we have consolidated the 1,300-points level, paving the way for a positive development next week,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Boehler was the top percentage gainer, up 13 schillings or 1.42 percent to 967 schillings. VA Tech advanced 28 schillings to 2,170.</p>
<p>June ATX futures closed one point down at 1,307 on turnover of 608 lots. The broad-based Vienna bourse index shed 0.54 points to 478.62.</p>
