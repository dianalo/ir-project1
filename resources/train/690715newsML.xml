<p>Hundreds of thousands of bottles of fake vodka seized by Moscow police went to a chemical factory for re-processing into brake fluid and car windscreen cleanser, Interfax news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Quoting an Economic Crimes Department officer, it said about 340,000 bottles of vodka brought to Moscow in 70 railroad wagons from Russia's Caucasus region of north Ossetia had been found to be hazardous to health and sent to the chemical plant.</p>
<p>Police also confiscated 1.5 million bottles of Moscow-made fake vodka and more than four tonnes of alcohol used to produce the counterfeit drink.</p>
<p>The number of alcohol-related deaths in Russia has more than doubled during the 1990s as many vendors have offered cheap moonshine to a public eager for bargains.</p>
<p>Earlier this month 22 people died in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk after drinking tainted vodka. In a separate case later in June at least nine people died and scores were hospitalised in the Russian town of Shchuchye in the southern Urals.</p>
<p>Interfax also quoted a Russian Health Ministry official as saying on Wednesday every sixth bottle of Russian-made alcoholic drink and every 13th bottle of foreign-made liquor had to be destroyed due poor quality.</p>
<p>Health officials say annual average per capita consumption of alcohol has almost doubled in recent years due to wide availablity and generally low prices.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin has launched a public campaign aimed at restoring at least a partial state monopoly on alcohol production and trade.</p>
<p>Vladimir Yarmosh, the head of Russia's powerful alcohol producers' lobby Spirtprom, has said fake vodka poisoning claims 50,000-100,000 Russian lives a year.</p>
<p>Yarmosh's figures are higher than official ones which show that alcohol poisoning accounted for almost 23 deaths per every 100,000 Russians in 1996, or about 35,000 people. But even the official rate is twice as high as it was in 1990.</p>
<p>Yarmosh also said fake vodka accounted for 71 percent of Russia's entire domestic vodka market. He said the state lost about 15 trillion roubles ($2.6 billion) annually from counterfeit production and smuggling. ($ = 5762 Russian Roubles)</p>
