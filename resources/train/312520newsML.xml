<p>Pakistani rice export prices are recovering from brief dip this week amid a bullish mood in local markets, exporters said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices have rebounded this week and are expected to rise next week,&quot; Javed Islam Agha, chairman of the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Super basmati rice, competing with India's best quality basmati, jumped to $625-$650 per tonne FOB from $610-$625 after Pakistan began exporting it to the European Union under new laws designed to ensure better quality, a dealer said.</p>
<p>The News newspaper said that a first shipment of 105 tonnes of super basmati had been shipped to Britain on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The dealer said prices would rise on expected higher exports to Gulf Arab states and Iraq, which some exporters said had bought unspecified quantities of rice from Pakistan.</p>
<p>Rice exports rose 83.24 percent to 217,876 tonnes worth $55 million in December from 118,899 worth $32 million in November.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1996/97 (July-June), rice exports rose 10.58 percent to 654,966 tonnes worth $195 million, compared to 592,300 tonnes worth $200 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>&quot;Exports are likely to increase in the second half,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>Prices of IRRI-6, which dipped this week, also firmed on higher demand from abroad and were expected to rise further after the government told the state-run Rice Export Corporation of Pakistan (RECP) to buy from cash-short farmers, he said.</p>
<p>He said big dealers were not buying large quantities from farmers in the belief that prices would fall.</p>
<p>The RECP sold its last stocks of 42,016 tonnes of IRRI-6 in an open auction at $238 per tonne CIF at the end of December.</p>
<p>The caretaker government has announced plans to merge it with the state-run Trading Corporation of Pakistan, but the decision has not yet been implemented.</p>
