<title>THAILAND: Thais to allow greater foreign role in finance.</title>

<p>Thailand said on Tuesday it would allow greater foreign equity participation in new banks and merging finance companies as part of its bid to boost the country's ailing financial sector.</p>
<p>Bank of Thailand Governor Rerngchai Marakanond told a news conference that the decision to allow a greater foreign role was part of four executive decrees approved by the cabinet to speed up consolidation of Thailand's 91 cash-strapped finance firms.  </p>
<p>The much-awaited decrees deal broadly with finance company mergers and securitisation of finance firm loans to the troubled property sector. They are immediately binding and were issued as Thailand tunnelled through its worst economic crisis in over a decade.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be more flexible on foreign equity participation but we have not set the ceiling for this. It will be decided on a case by case basis,&quot; Rerngchai said at the joint news conference with new Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya. Thailand currently puts a 25 percent limit on foreign ownership in banks and finance firms.</p>
<p>Rerngchai said merging finance firms seeking new bank licences could seek government approval of foreign equity participation above the current limit. &quot;Our earlier experience showed that our efforts in encouraging finance firms to merge ran into many obstacles,&quot; the governor said. A much-touted mega merger between Thai Danu Bank Plc and Finance One Plc collapsed last month with both parties blaming tax and legal constraints for the failure.</p>
<p>Thanong said the decrees would boost the financial sector and strengthen its long-term stability. The decrees also include the launch of a state-run secondary mortgage corporation to buy or refinance billions of dollars in sub-standard property loans and assets of finance firms and resell them as asset-backed securities.</p>
<p>Thanong said the loan securitisation measures were designed to deal with severe liquidity problems currently faced by finance companies and property developers. Pokin Polakun, a minister in the prime minister's office, said the urgent decrees were implemented to curb rapidly growing problems faced by the sectors which weighed further on the slowing economy.</p>
