<p>Cuba said on Thursday it had awarded a &quot;Medal of Friendship&quot; to outgoing Canadian ambassador Mark Entwistle in recognition of his work to strengthen ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>Entwistle, who is leaving Cuba on Friday after four years in Havana, was presented with the medal by deputy president Carlos Lage on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and parliament president Ricardo Alarcon attended the ceremony.</p>
<p>The statement said Entwistle had made a &quot;valiant contribution to the strengthening of bilateral ties.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada says it wants to encourage change through dialogue with President Fidel Castro's communist government, rather than through confrontation.</p>
<p>Its stance has sometimes irritated the United States, which maintains an economic embargo on Havana and believes Cuba should be isolated as a means of pressure.</p>
<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy made a brief official trip to Cuba in January, and the two countries signed a joint declaration agreeing to more cooperation in a range of areas, including human rights.</p>
<p>Cuba made clear at the time it preferred Canada's position to that of the United States or European Union, which has adopted a common position on Cuba including a clause under which improved relations depend on Havana making moves towards political and economic change.</p>
<p>Canada has become a leading business partner of Cuba since the early 1990s, Canadian firms are key investors, trade is worth about $400 million a year, and Canadian tourists were the largest group of foreign visitors to the island last year.</p>
