<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Micron Electronics speculation up.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Call buying in Micron Electronics Inc was heavy for the second straight session Wednesday as takeover speculation heated up, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;No one's confirming or denying that anything's going on,&quot; said Jon Najarian, president of Mercury Trading, the designated primary market maker in Micron Electronics options at the Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;But we suspect something is going on through the activity,&quot; he said, explaining that investors were buying up April and May 22-1/2 and 25 calls.  </p>
<p>The Micron Electronics April 22-1/2 call traded a total of about 470 contracts and the April 25 call traded 650.</p>
<p>In addition to the CBOE, the options trade on the American Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange.</p>
<p>In the May series, the May 22-1/2 call traded about 360 contracts and the May 25 call traded about 600.</p>
<p>Among Micron Electronics puts, the April 22-1/2 traded roughly 350 contracts and the April 25 traded 105.</p>
<p>Najarian said the activity was flowing from several firms, not just the big brokerage firms, suggesting the rumor had been widely disseminated around Wall Street.  </p>
<p>According to Lawrence McMillan, who publishes the Daily Volume Alert, volume in Micron Electronics options on Tuesday rose to 2,036 from an average of 964, with more than 1,400 on the call side, compared with around 600 puts.</p>
<p>Micron Electronics stock rose 1-1/8 to 23-1/2 on 2.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Najarian said that in addition to an increase in volume, volatilities on Micron Electronics options rose sharply.</p>
<p>He explained that volatility in the April and May 22-1/2 and 25 calls had risen into the 72 to 75 percent range compared to an average over the past month of 62 percent.  </p>
<p>Late Tuesday, PC Week Online reported that the Idaho-based mail-order computer company had ben approached about a possible merger.</p>
<p>A Micron Electronics spokesman declined comment.</p>
<p>Micron Electronics is an affiliate of Micron Technology Inc,  which owns 80 percent. A Micron Technology spokesman was not available for comment.</p>
