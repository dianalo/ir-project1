<p>Ukraine's Danube Shipping Company (UDASCO), once one of the river's biggest carriers, has started seeking foreign investors as it moves to recover from sanctions against Belgrade -- once its main trading partner.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find a strategic investor. That is what we are doing now very actively,&quot; UDASCO President Petro Suvorov told Reuters late on Thursday at the port of Izmail, where UDASCO is based.</p>
<p>&quot;In name we are a shareholding company but in fact we are a 100 percent state-owned enterprise because parliament has included us on a list of strategic enterprises which cannot be privatised,&quot; Suvorov said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;But when we find a strategic, investor it would not be a problem to change the status de facto,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Suvorov, appointed president last month, said estimates for necessary strategic foreign investments were $100-200 million.</p>
<p>UDASCO, running 55 ocean-faring vessels and 850 river ships, boats and barges with a total deadweight capacity of 1.2 million tonnes, shipped 40 million tonnes of cargo on the Danube and worldwide last year.</p>
<p>But about 40 per cent of shipping capacity went unused for the company, which also owns five cruise ships.</p>
<p>&quot;Our hopes are pinned on a Danube shipping boom once sanctions against Yugoslavia, which have been lifted, become a reality,&quot; Suvorov said, referring to the 1992/95 international sanctions against Belgrade.</p>
<p>The nearby Port of Reni has been working at a quarter of its 12-million-tonne annual capacity, Izmail at half of its nine million tonne capacity, with tiny Ust-Dunaisk working least.</p>
<p>&quot;Customers have found other ways to ship than traditional ones. To avoid the Yugoslav stretch of the Danube via Slovenia, there is the new Danube-Rhine channel with railways. It's not Ukraine's problem but the Danube's problem -- the amount of cargo shipped has been halved since 1991,&quot; Suvorov said.</p>
<p>He added there had been increased competition from Germany, Dutch and Russian shipping companies.</p>
<p>Suvorov said hopes of quick economic growth in the former Yugoslavia, once one of the former Soviet Union's biggest trade partners, had also been dashed.</p>
<p>In Soviet days, Ukraine traded $2 billion annually with the former Yugoslavia but currently the trade figure with rump-Yugoslavia stands at only $40 million.</p>
<p>But Suvorov said in 1994 UDASCO, which employs 9,800 people, built four 4,000-tonne sea cargo ships and 60 new barges using credits from Portugese and Austrian banks.</p>
<p>UDASCO revenues during the first four months of this year stood at $40 million, he added.</p>
<p>Its management has also pinned hopes on the new Prorva five-metre-deep channel from the Danube to the Black Sea to shorten the distance to Izmail and attract larger sea-going ships to Ukraine's stretch of the Danube instead of Romania's.</p>
<p>He said the channel would open by the end of the year with $6 million in investments, adding another $40 million project foresaw upgrading other channels to a depth of seven metres.</p>
