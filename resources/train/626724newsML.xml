<title>TURKEY: Nadir threatens legal action in Britain.</title>
<headline>Nadir threatens legal action in Britain.</headline>
<dateline>ISTANBUL 1997-05-30</dateline>

<p>Fugitive Turkish Cypriot tycoon Asil Nadir said on Friday his lawyers had prepared legal action against British authorities in connection with the collapse of his business empire.</p>
<p>Nadir, who is wanted for fraud in Britain, jumped bail four years ago after the collapse of his Polly Peck International fruit-to-electronics empire.</p>
<p>&quot;Cases are ready against the British government and its various organs that have committed crimes,&quot; a sombre-looking Nadir told a news conference in Istanbul.</p>
<p>&quot;In the coming weeks I will have opened cases for compensation that will proceed very quickly at all levels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Nadir told his lawyers to sue Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for wrongly trying to prosecute him but said it was unlikely he would return to Britain in the forseeable future.</p>
<p>The flamboyant businessman told BBC radio on Friday he would return to Britain if he was guaranteed he would not be arrested and if the government holds a public inquiry into the collapse of Polly Peck.</p>
<p>He said he was prepared to do whatever is required of him if he is given the guarantees.</p>
<p>&quot;If I have an assurance to the government of Turkey that I will not be arrested...I'd be delighted to come back with a definite undertaking that there will be a public inquiry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important for the British public to find out what actually went on,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Nadir, who holds a Turkish passport, flew to Istanbul on May 20 on his first trip out of his native Cyprus since he fled there from British justice four years ago.</p>
<p>Turkish police have said they will not hand Nadir over to British authorities. Britain and NATO ally Turkey do not have an extradition treaty but usually hand over criminal suspects to each other under a Council of Europe agreement.</p>
<p>He told BBC radio he fled Britain rather than face trail on charges of theft and false accounting because he had no confidence in British justice. Nadir could not be extradited from Northern Cyprus, which is only recognised by Ankara.</p>
<p>&quot;These allegations against me were done without any investigations whatsoever,&quot; he said. &quot;You don't arrest someone, charge them and then try to find out how you can proceed with the matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Since he fled Britain in May 1993, Nadir has hinted he would return if the Conservatives, who were defeated by Labour in the May 1 election, were no longer the governing party.</p>
<p>Preparations for a trial of Nadir were thrown into chaos before he fled Britain when authorities said they had discovered an attempt to pervert the course of justice. The charges were later found to be groundless.</p>
<p>In March convictions against Nadir's former aide Elizabeth Forsyth were quashed but the SFO said that did not affect its case against Nadir.</p>
<p>A British newspaper also reported that SFO officers were sent to Turkey this month for talks with judicial officials in Ankara after reports that Nadir was going to visit there.</p>
