<p>Regulators from 18 nations meet in Britain on Monday to try to prevent another scandal in the murky world of trade in key raw materials like the Sumitomo affair.</p>
<p>So secretive are the regulatory agencies' talks that the market &quot;watchdogs&quot; won't even hint at where they will be cloistered, beyond saying that it is somewhere inside London's M-25 orbital motorway.</p>
<p>But they leave little doubt that scandal in copper and implications right across the multi-billion-dollar business in commodity futures and derivatives will top the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;The focus will be on commodity futures and physicals multilaterally for the first time,&quot; said a spokesman for the British Securities and Investment Board (SIB).</p>
<p>The SIB alongside American and Japanese regulators and fraud squads is at the hub of a global inquiry into events surrounding the dismissal on June 14 of Yasuo Hamanaka, 49, star trader for Japanese metals conglomerate Sumitomo Corp.</p>
<p>Sumitomo alleges that Hamanaka was a maverick who ran up losses worth $2.6 billion on unauthorized deals.</p>
<p>Dealers say they think that he used huge stocks of copper that were held by Sumitomo to support a high-price trading strategy in derivatives -- making profits there that helped to offset potential loss on selling copper cheap in Asia to win market share. It all leaves regulators to puzzle out whether or not such a strategy -- if it ever existed -- fell foul of the rules, and whether the rules and their surveillance need tightening. The regulators are midnful that they are dealing with raw materials on which prices are crucial to the global economy and to every household budget around the world. Britain's SIB co-hosts the meeting with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which probably thinks that they do, and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).</p>
<p>Official sources stress that the talks are not specifically about Sumitomo but are intended to be forward looking and develop links between agencies who do not normally cooperate.</p>
<p>The agenda will cover the design of commodity futures contracts, surveillance, and, as a consequence, information sharing between regulators, SIB spokesmen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan is an example. MITI is responsible for commodities but SIB never dealt with MITI before Sumitomo,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>A similar meeting at Windsor, England, in 1995, dealt with the collapse of Britain's Barings bank after Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson ran up losses on alleged unauthorised deals. But the upcoming Monday and Tuesday session of talks will also bring in regulatory agencies from emerging markets and raw material producing countries, the SIB spokesmen said.</p>
<p>Measures agreed at Windsor including a stress on the need to report large positions and procedures to handle market crises were to some extent used in June in the Sumitomo affair.</p>
<p>&quot;We were able to manage a crisis as a result of Windsor...it had an effect,&quot; one SIB spokesman said.</p>
<p>After Hamanaka's exit copper prices slumped from above $2,700 a tonne to $1,745 and liquidity in copper trading began to dry up. He faces forgery and fraud allegations. An SIB official said that &quot;because we were dealing with commodities, specific issues came up that were not inherent with the work down at Windsor. We were again learning lessons.&quot;</p>
<p>The new talks are expected to result in a statement of ideals, although the SIB do not anticipate the same worldwide programme that followed Windsor. This is because the meeting is more a &quot;mapping-out&quot; exercise and sharing of information.</p>
<p>SIB believes that the consensus approach to regulation since Windsor has already raised standards and practices.</p>
<p>&quot;The exchanges realise that standards have to be adequate. They have to be safe places to do business&quot; an official said.</p>
<p>For their part, traders hope that regulators will tackle the unregulated Over-the-Counter market in commdodity trading instruments which was pivotal in the Sumitomo scandal.</p>
<p>But agreements will not have legal force.</p>
