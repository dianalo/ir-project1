<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Tech stock options lead market.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Tech stock options lead market.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>With technology stocks leading most U.S. stock market indices higher, options on those stocks were among the most active, particularly on the call side.</p>
<p>In the cash market, the Dow industrial average surged 102 points, or 1.6 percent, to 6,544.</p>
<p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite soared 30 points, or 2.3 percent, to about 1,311.</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp options had the busiest individual options but Intel Corp options as a group were the most active.  </p>
<p>The IBM January 155 call traded 5,343 contracts and rose 2-7/8 to 6-1/2. The IBM January 160 call, which added 1-9/16 to 3-1/2, traded 3,945 contracts.</p>
<p>Underlying shares of IBM gained 5-7/8 to 159-1/8 on consolidated turnover of 3.2 million shares.</p>
<p>The most active IBM put was the January 155, which traded 3,829 contracts. With the stock up, the put option fell 2-11/16 to 2-3/16.</p>
<p>On the American Stock Exchange, Intel options were a highlight as the stock surged eight points to 138-3/8 on heavy turnover of nearly 12 million shares.  </p>
<p>Intel calls alone, led by the January 140s, which traded 4,756 contracts, traded more than 30,000 contracts. The most active put was the January 125, which traded 1,415. It lost two points to 1-1/4.</p>
<p>Other busy technology stock options included calls on Micron Technology Inc and Zitel Corp, which has been extremely volatile this week.</p>
<p>Zitel shares bucked the broad market trend, slumping 4-3/8 to 45-3/4. Earlier this week the stock hit an all-time high of 72-7/8 before tumbling. Friday's range for the stock was 13-3/4 points.  </p>
<p>In other activity, two calls on Chrysler Corp shares saw heavy trading as two investors apparently closed out positions.</p>
<p>The Chrysler January 30 call traded 2,248 contracts and the January 35 call traded 4,059.</p>
<p>Those two calls have the highest open interest among Chrysler January calls. Open interest through Thursday was 14,742 in the January 35 and 11,830 in the January 30.</p>
<p>Traders said a 3,000 lot of the January 35 calls went out at 9/16 and 2,000 of the January 30s went out at 4-5/8.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was two different houses, both customer sells,&quot; one trader said. &quot;We're getting close to expiration so my guess would be they're just closing out positions.&quot;</p>
<p>January options expire in two weeks.</p>
<p>On the Pacific Stock Exchange, call options on shares of WorldCom Inc continued to trade heavily. The stock rose 3/8 to 26-7/8 and takeover speculation remains solid, traders said.</p>
<p>The January 25, 27-1/2 and 30 calls, all with high open interest, traded more than 3,000 contracts each. ((-G.Crawford, 312 408 8750/Email: derivatives@reuters.com))</p>
