<p>Indonesia has said the safety of its waters is not under threat from pirate attacks despite the recent hijacking of a Malaysian oil tanker, the official Antara news agency reported on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;So far our seas are safe. Our warships are patrolling every day of the year,&quot; Indonesian navy chief Vice Admiral Arief Kushariadi was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The news agency said Kushariadi was responding to a report by an office of the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) in Kuala Lumpur which had said Indonesian waters were home to a high percentage of the world's pirates.</p>
<p>Kushariadi said the navy had not yet confirmed whether a Malaysian gasoil tanker hijacked off the coast of Singapore last month was now in Indonesian waters.</p>
<p>Indonesia has pledged to use two Australian-made Nomad N-22 aicraft and patrol ships in the search for the tanker, which was hijacked by six unidentified pirates.</p>
<p>The Malaysian-owned vessel, Suci, and its $600,000 cargo of gasoil were stolen about 60 miles off the east coast of Singapore while heading for Sandakan port in the Malaysian province of Sabah.</p>
<p>The hijacking came to light after 15 of the ship's crew were rescued by a fishing boat operating from a port on the Indonesian island of Batam, around 50 miles (80 km) south of Singapore.</p>
<p>The crew of 11 Indonesians, two South Koreans and two Burmese had been set adrift by the hijackers two days before they were rescued.</p>
<p>A further two Indonesians, both engineers, were detained aboard the ship by the pirates.</p>
