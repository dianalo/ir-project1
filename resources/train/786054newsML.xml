<headline>Greece critical of Turkey-northern Cyprus accord.</headline>
<dateline>ATHENS 1997-08-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Greece on Thursday described an accord aimed at the partial integration of northern Cyprus with Turkey as blackmail, saying such moves only distance Ankara from its aspirations in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Union has stressed that resolving the Cyprus issue is a pre-condition for Turkey's European path,&quot; Deputy Foreign Minister George Papandreou told reporters. &quot;Turkey should know such moves clearly do not contribute to its European direction.&quot;</p>
<p>The agreement signed on Wednesday calls for an Association Council to work towards the partial economic and defence integration of Turkey with the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.</p>
<p>The internationally recognised Cypriot government in the south has dismissed the accord, saying it was aimed at provoking Cyprus to boycott U.N.-sponsored talks next week on ways of resolving the conflict splitting the Mediterranean island.</p>
<p>But Greece reacted more strongly, accusing Turkey of undermining the peace talks and trying to stop Cyprus from joining the EU.</p>
<p>Ankara has said it will unite the north with Turkey if accession talks begin next year between the Greek Cypriot-led government and the EU, which now numbers 15 members, including Greece.</p>
<p>&quot;This is sheer blackmail by Ankara against the European Union but Cyprus's accession cannot be obstructed by such blackmail,&quot; Greek Defence Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos was quoted as saying by the semi-official Athens News Agency.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not Greece but Turkey who is damaged by such fireworks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders are due to meet in Montreux, Switzerland, on Monday, for a second round of talks aimed at reviving negotiations to reunite the island, which has been divided since Turkey occupied its northern third in 1974.</p>
<p>The Turkish Cypriot state in the north was declared in 1983 and is recognised only by Ankara.</p>
