<p>U.S. Treasuries opened unchanged in listless trade on Tuesday as participants waited for the outcome of a Federal Reserve meeting at which policy makers will discuss whether or not to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury opened at 96-9/32, yielding 6.92 percent, unchanged from Monday's close.</p>
<p>Ten-year notes opened at 99-13/32, up 1/32, to yield 6.71 percent, five-years at 100-8/32, unchanged and yielding 6.56 percent. Two-year notes traded at 100-6/32, yielding 6.27 percent, unchanged from Monday's close.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market's focus is on the FOMC meeting,&quot; said Kim Rupert, senior economist at MMS International.</p>
<p>Rupert said the BTM/Schroders weekly chain store index is rumored to be up 0.3 percent but said the market would choose to ignore that for the time being and just wait for the announcement from the Fed meeting. Nervousness could cause prices to drift a little lower heading into the 1415 EDT/1815 GMT FOMC announcement, she said.</p>
<p>Rupert said her firm expects the Fed to raise the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points because the economy is strong and the Fed wants to pre-empt inflationary pressures.  </p>
<p>Rupert said the Treasury market's preoccupation with the Tuesday Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting kept it from reacting to the &quot;plunge in the dollar&quot; overnight.</p>
<p>The dollar was sharply lower against the yen and also weaker versus the mark due to talk of higher Japanese interest rates. The dollar tumbled to 112.80 yen overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury market seemed to completely ignore the dollar overnight,&quot; said James Blumenthal, economist at MCM Moneywatch. &quot;The focus is the FOMC.&quot;</p>
<p>Blumenthal said MCM believes the outcome of the FOMC meeting is a close call, but it expects a rate hike.  </p>
<p>Blumenthal said the market probably won't do very much before the FOMC meeting ends.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is just going to range trade until the outcome of the FOMC meeting is clear,&quot; he said. &quot;All the action will be this afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said a rate hike would damage the front end of the maturity curve the most. A 77-basis-point spread between the two-year note yield and the 5-1/2 percent Federal funds rate indicates that the short end of the yield curve has made scant allowance for a Fed rate hike.  </p>
<p>Shorter-term maturities are also the most sensitive to the cost of carry, they noted.</p>
<p>Some analysts argued that the long end of the maturity range was in a win-win situation.</p>
<p>If the Fed declines to raise rates, that restrains the cost of holding inventories of any securities, including long maturities.</p>
<p>But if the Fed raises rates, investors could focus on the central bank's vigilant stance against inflation, a positive factor for the long-term debt market.  </p>
<p>Besides the two privately collected weekly retail sales indicators, BTM/Schroders' and the Redbook, there is no economic data scheduled for release until the March trade data on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At the short end of the maturity range, the three-month bill rate was 5.23 percent in early dealings, the six-month bill rate was 5.38 percent and the year-bill rate was 5.56 percent.</p>
