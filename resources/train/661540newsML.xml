<headline>Annan calls India-Pakistan talks &quot;exciting&quot;.</headline>

<p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday described recent talks between India and Pakistan as &quot;exciting and important&quot; and said he hoped continued discussions would eventually resolve the Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>Answering a question about Kashmir, he told a news conference: &quot;Yes, there are U.N. resolutions and we have observers on the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;But I think what is exciting and important is the talks going on between Pakistan and India. There's a lot happening in that region.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to a meeting in the Maldives last month between Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Another meeting is planned.</p>
<p>India rules two-thirds and Pakistan the rest of Kashmir, over which the two countries have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
<p>Annan said he met the foreign ministers of both countries during a conference of the non-aligned movement in India in March.</p>
<p>Gujral, then India's foreign minister, was &quot;pursuing this effort and policy of good neighbourliness,&quot; the U.N. chief said.</p>
<p>&quot;And I think there are results, both with the sharing of waters in the Ganges, the agreement with Nepal, the settlement of the military border issue with China and his determined efforts to improve relations with Pakistan.&quot;</p>
<p>Alluding to Kashmir, Annan said: &quot;I know there are U.N. resolutions, U.N. positions, but these are not self-fulfilling or self-enforcing, and I think it is important that the two parties are talking.</p>
<p>&quot;And I am very hopeful that if the talks continue, they will make progress, they would improve relations, eventually resolve the issue of Kashmir, I hope.</p>
<p>&quot;But at least it would calm the sub-continent and I would hope people can switch resources from military to economic and social development,&quot; he said.</p>
