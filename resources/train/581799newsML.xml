<headline>FOCUS-Paris hits record among mixed euro bourses.</headline>

<p>Paris stocks closed at a record level on Wednesday, lifted by opinion polls which eased anxiety about upcoming elections, but other leading European bourses were mixed despite receding fears of a U.S. interest rate hike.</p>
<p>On currencies, U.S. economic data which dimmed prospects of higher interest rates dragged the dollar down as dollar-denominated assets looked less attractive to investors.</p>
<p>Paris blue chips put on a sparkling performance, surging over two percent to close at a peak of 2,774.63 points on the CAC-40 index, eclipsing the previous best of 2,736.71 set two months ago.</p>
<p>The stocks hit an all-time high in morning trade, boosted by new opinion polls suggesting a big win for the centre-right government in parliamentary elections at the end of this month and in June. Then they roared ahead again in the afternoon as the U.S. figures hit trading screens.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is clearly playing on a win by the centre-right,&quot; said a head trader at a German bank in Paris.</p>
<p>Paris was given an extra dose of adrenalin by the Washington data which showed the biggest decline in producer prices in nearly four years in April, tempering concerns that the inflation-wary U.S. central bank will raise interest rates at a meeting next Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the French market was mainly encouraged by a better outlook for government parties regarded as more sympathetic to business. &quot;All the signs are on green: the dollar, the bond market and the polls,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>A CSA poll on Tuesday night gave 317 seats to the centre-right majority against 215 to the Socialists and their allies. This followed a BVA poll giving 303 to the majority and 226 to the Socialists and allies.</p>
<p>Jacques Chahine Finance has reported that if the government parties win, fund managers believe the CAC would head above 3,000. If the Socialists win it could fall to 2,400.</p>
<p>In London, Europe's biggest bourse, the FTSE 100 index closed slightly lower as the market's record-breaking post-election surge finally showed signs of running out of steam.</p>
<p>The stocks see-sawed in afternoon trade, not helped much by Wall Street's strong opening, and ended 4.1 points lower, at 4,686.9, marking the end of an unpredecented eight-session run of record closing highs.</p>
<p>Analysts and dealers said the market was due for a period of consolidation after its 7.2 percent advance since the start of the month but more gains were on the cards in the medium term.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, dealings on the computerised IBIS index showed gains of 0.8 percent at the close largely on the strength of the lower-than-expected U.S. inflation figures.</p>
<p>But floor trade, which closed at a record level on Tuesday, ended before the U.S. data was issued and was showing losses of 0.4 percent at the finish.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom recovered after falling on reports that the Bonn government might consider selling some of its Telekom shares to help cut its budget deficit.</p>
<p>On currency markets, the dollar edged down against the mark, shedding earlier gains after the shock drop in U.S. producer prices cast a damper on speculation of near-term interest rates increases.</p>
<p>The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) next meets to decide rate policy on May 20. Many dealers had been anticipating a 25 basis point increase but the PPI data changed many minds.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people seem to be of the view that the FOMC is too close to call. The producer prices will have encouraged a few more to believe there will be no Fed rate hike,&quot; said Adrian Owens, international economist at Julius Baer Investments.</p>
<p>STOCK PRICES</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 ended down 4.1 points at 4,686.9.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 index finished up 55.05 points at 2,774.63.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index closed down 21.46 points at 3,573.69.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.6977 marks in late trade compared with 1.6965 on Tuesday and 118.29 yen versus 118.83.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold ended at $348.65 an ounce after closing at $348.05 in London on Tuesday. Silver was up two cents at $4.87 in late trade.</p>
