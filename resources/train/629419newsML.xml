<title>FRANCE: Projected Socialist win to limit markets fall.</title>

<text>
<p>A projected clear majority for the Socialist Party in Sunday's runoff parliamentary election vote was expected to mitigate falls on French financial markets, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>Investors had feared a failure by the Socialists to attain an absolute majority of 289 seats in the lower house National Assembly would force them into a power-sharing deal with the Communists, who are outright opponents of the euro single currency and of social security reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the Socialists have an absolute majority so the market reaction may be rather soft,&quot; Philippe Brossard, head of research at ABN Amro Finance, said. &quot;I would still say slightly negative but maybe not all that much.&quot;</p>
<p>The franc eased slightly against the mark but the fall was softened by the prospect of a Communist-free administration.</p>
<p>Projections from the BVA, SOFRES and CSA polling institutes early Sunday evening all showed the Socialists winning an outright majority in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not expecting the franc to weaken that much. I think people had a target of 3.40 per mark if the Socialists did not have an absolute majority,&quot; Brossard said.</p>
<p>The franc was trading at 3.3822 per mark Sunday night compared to 3.3816 late Friday.</p>
<p>Prices on the Paris stock market, which fell 6 percent during the week, are expected to fall further, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Equities strategist Gary Dugan at J.P. Morgan said he expected the Paris bourse's CAC-40 index to fall next week but not more than 3 percent.</p>
<p>The CAC-40, which finished down 6.48 percent last week at 2,583.94 points, could fall to 2,500. &quot;I would be surprised to see it go much lower,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
