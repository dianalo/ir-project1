<headline>S.African tribe to press legal fight with Implats.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1996-09-27</dateline>

<p>A South African tribe is to press ahead with its legal claims against platinum giant Impala Platinum (Implats) in a dispute over valuable mining rights agreements.</p>
<p>In a statement issued Friday the Bafokeng nation said a decision had been taken at a general meeting of the tribe that relations with Implats had sunk to an &quot;all-time low&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;(It was) accordingly resolved that the legal action instituted by the Bafokeng nation to set aside the said agreements must run its course,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Under the current agreement, signed in 1990 and covering Implats' platinum mines on Bafokeng land, the tribe is entitled to 14.9 percent of taxable income from the current lease royalties.</p>
<p>The deal also extended in perpetuity previous agreements concluded on behalf of the tribe dating back to 1977 and 1986 which otherwise would have had to be renegotiated in 1993.</p>
<p>The tribe's claim is based on allegations that Lucas Mangope, the president of the former black homeland of Bophuthatswana, was not trustee of the land when he sealed the 1990 agreement. The tribe says the true trustee, its late Chief Edward Patrick Lebone Molotlegi, was in exile at the time.</p>
<p>The long-running dispute, which officially began last December with the issuing of a legal summons from the Bafokeng, now looks almost certain to hit the courts.</p>
<p>An Impala spokeswoman declined to comment in any detail on the situation, and signalled the company was now gearing up for a legal fight. &quot;We have decided that we are not going to fight this battle through the media,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Bafokeng contends that should it win its action then Implats would lose its right to mine the land and the tribe would be entitled to claim profits made by Implats while mining under the 1990 deal.</p>
<p>The strongly-worded Bafokeng statement accused Implats of misleading shareholders as to relations between the tribe and the company. An Implats source said this was most likely a reference to statements about the dispute in the firm's latest annual report.</p>
<p>In the document Implats said the Bafokeng had abruptly escalated the dispute by issuing the summons.</p>
<p>The next stage of the fight will be the submission of Implats' defence plea, which is due in at the end of October. The Implats source said the firm was confident the legal spat would not affect the firm and it would succeed in its defence.</p>
<p>&quot;We have said all along that the agreements are valid and that we believe we have a strong case,&quot; the source said.</p>
