<p>Ten days before national elections, Ireland's opposition parties have stretched their lead over Prime Minister John Bruton's ruling coalition, which is ensnared in a row over its Northern Ireland policies.</p>
<p>A poll by Landsdowne Market Research for the Evening Herald on May 24 showed that the opposition partnership of Bertie Ahern's Fianna Fail party and Mary Harney's Progressive Democrats 17 points ahead of Bruton's coalition in Dublin.</p>
<p>It showed that Ahern and Harney were backed by 50 per cent of voters in the capital, which returns about one third of seats in parliament, against 33 per cent for Bruton and his allies, the Labour Party and Democratic Left.</p>
<p>It was published on the day that Bruton met his Foreign Minister and Labour party leader Dick Spring to reiterate that there were no differences in the coalition about how to treat the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) political wing, Sinn Fein.</p>
<p>Fianna Fail accused the ruling centre-left coalition of being &quot;all over the place on Northern Ireland&quot; on Tuesday after seemingly contradictory remarks by Spring and Bruton.</p>
<p>Spring on Monday said Sinn Fein's record 17-percent vote in Northern Ireland's local elections last week was a &quot;vote for peace&quot;.</p>
<p>This appeared to flatly contradict his prime minister, who said last month that votes for Sinn Fein, which shares the IRA's goal of ending British rule of Northern Ireland, were a vote for the IRA's campaign of violence.</p>
<p>&quot;The management of the peace process is not in good hands when the language and analysis of the leaders of the government parties is completely different,&quot; Fianna Fail's foreign affairs spokesman Ray Burke said.</p>
<p>&quot;We need this peace process to be brought forward urgently and rapidly, but this government is all over the place.&quot;</p>
<p>The row surfaced in the final days of a lacklustre election campaign and placed British-ruled Northern Ireland, which Ireland's constitution claims, at the top of the agenda.</p>
<p>It gave a further boost to the centre-right partnership of Fianna Fail which has been consistently ahead in opionion polls since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Spring said that Sinn Fein's vote showed that the electorate wanted peace and urged the party led by Gerry Adams, to persuade the IRA to call a new truce to replace one they ended in February last year.</p>
<p>Spring, who meets Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam on Thursday to review the Northern Ireland peace process, urged Sinn Fein to turn the IRA away from violence.</p>
<p>&quot;What I am reading into it (the Sinn Fein vote) is that people want peace on this island and I would hope that those who have to make decisions would accept that and then get into democratic talks,&quot; Spring said.</p>
<p>Bruton, whose party is the biggest in the government, also played down reports of a rift and said that Sinn Fein's mandate had to be translated into peace and a new IRA ceasefire.</p>
<p>The government's position on Sinn Fein, which is barred from Belfast peace talks because of IRA violence, was further confused by remarks by Justice Minister Nora Owen.</p>
<p>She urged voters in the border area of Monaghan to vote for &quot;anybody but Sinn Fein&quot; to avoid the outside chance of the party electing its first member of parliament and even holding key votes in the event of a hung parliament.</p>
<p>It was the first time in a campaign dominated by promises of tax cuts, job creation and law and order that Northern Ireland had held centre stage in campaigning.</p>
<p>All parties are committed to a peaceful resolution of the 28-year Northern Ireland conflict but Ahern's Fianna Fail says it is the natural Irish republican party and will get tough with Britain, its partner in the search for a settlement.</p>
