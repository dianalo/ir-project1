<p>Pakistan's new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Wednesday he was prepared to cut taxes imposed by a previous government led by Benazir Bhutto.</p>
<p>But he told a gathering of Pakistani business leaders that such a reduction could only be made if the business community assured him that they would not evade the reduced taxes.  </p>
<p>&quot;You tell me what you can pay and what you cannot pay,&quot; the pro-business prime minister said in his first meeting with the business community since his party's landslide victory in February 3 elections.</p>
<p>&quot;I am prepared to remove what you really cannot pay. But you must pay what you can pay,&quot; Sharif said to loud applause. &quot;I want to place blind faith in you and I also expect you to have blind faith in me and deposit your taxes.&quot;</p>
<p>Sharif has said his top priority is to revive the ailing economy and stimulate growth and blaming Bhutto's government, which was dismissed in November, for neglecting industry.</p>
