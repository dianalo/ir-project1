<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate leaps up on liqidity lack.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rate leaps up on liqidity lack.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-06-06</dateline>

<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates ended up 380 basis points at a session high of 24.00 percent on Friday due to lack of market liquidity, which traders put down to central bank intervention or brokers bailing out to cash in on record gains on the Mexican bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;Liquidity was tight because investors switched their money to the bourse, and this mean that Banco de Mexico drained more than it needed to,&quot; a fixed-income analyst said.</p>
<p>The bourse's blue chip IPC index meanwhile gained 41.32 points to a record close of 4,160.85.  </p>
<p>The central bank drained 3.658 billion pesos from the market through three direct Cetes sales and six repos.</p>
<p>Another analyst put sharp gains in secondary rates down to speculative dealing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all speculation, they're holding back their money. You can tell liquidity is tight, but in fact it is concentrated in just a few hands,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity was also under pressure from the June 11 deadline for banks to settle balances outstanding on checking accounts they hold with Banco de Mexico.  </p>
<p>Several analysts said secondary rates would remain under pressure due to uncertainty ahead of the July 2 Federal Open Market Committee meeting to review U.S. interest rate policy, and July 6 elections in Mexico for Congress, Mexico City mayor and several state governors.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper paralleled government rates and increased 320 basis points to 24.50 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 320 million pesos was scheduled to return to the system on Monday from prior central bank participation.</p>
