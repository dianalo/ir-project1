<p>InaCom Corp, which posted record fourth-quarter and year-end results, said Wednesday all sectors of its business showed consistent growth and it sees demand continuing into the new year.</p>
<p>&quot;During 1996 revenue growth from technology products was up 41 percent, services grew by 43 percent and communications by 39 percent,&quot; said president Bill Fairfield in a statement.</p>
<p>The executive added that InaCom's recent consulting acquisitions will support growth in 1997.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have not experienced any slowdown in the demand for computer and telecommunications products and services from our business clients,&quot; Fairfield said.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer David Guenthner said in a statement the company's vendors &quot;did a good job of making sure we had the products to meet our clients' needs.&quot;</p>
<p>Guenthner said that, during the fourth quarter, the company added service professionals and technical support staff, which resulted in an increase in SG&amp;A expenses.</p>
<p>InaCom reported fourth-quarter earnings, including acquisition charges, rose to $0.56 a primary share from $0.43. For the year, they gained to $1.76 from $1.14. Revenues were $920.7 million, up from $656.2 million in the quarter, and $3.10 billion, up from $2.20 billion for the year.</p>
<p>InaCom markets information technology products such as microcomputer systems, work stations and telecommunications equipment.</p>
