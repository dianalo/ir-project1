<p>U.S. seasonally adjusted retail sales rose 0.5 percent for the first two weeks of fiscal April versus March, according to the Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc Redbook Retail Sales Index.</p>
<p>The index rose 6.4 percent compared with the same month a year ago, the report said.  Adjusted retail sales rose 6.2 percent in the week ended April 19 compared with the same week a year ago, it said.  </p>
<p>Most retailers in the Redbook survey fell modestly short of plan for the week, and continued to characterize sales for April to date as &quot;disappointing,&quot; said Howard Eilenberg, a retail analyst at Redbook Research.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just a continuation of a slowdown that we've had for the last couple of weeks,&quot; Eilenberg said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television. &quot;The exuberance that we saw in February and in early March just isn't there anymore,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the modest slowdown in retail sales, national department stores improved slightly, Eilenberg said. &quot;(National department stores) looked better the second week than the first week,&quot; he said, adding that they were on plan for the month.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the discounters that took a little stumble this past week ... a lot of them underplanned for week and the month-to-date,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Eilenberg noted the slump in discount sales was mostly attributed to the harsh winter-like weather in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other regions showed no signs of weak sales.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the Midwest that kind of dragged everything down,&quot; Eilenberg added.</p>
