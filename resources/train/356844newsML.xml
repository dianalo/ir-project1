<title>KAZAKHSTAN: Kazakhstan launches new bankruptcy law.</title>

<p>Kazakhstan has introduced a new law on bankruptcy which the authorities hope will speed up the restructuring of troubled state-owned companies.</p>
<p>Alexander Molokanov, director of the Enterprise Restructuring Agency, told a news conference that the law coming into force on Wednesday was already the third attempt to apply a bankruptcy law.</p>
<p>According to official statistics, 4,356 Kazakh companies, or 43.9 percent of all enterprises, are loss-making. State-run companies make up 70 percent of these.</p>
<p>But Molokanov said: &quot;Bankruptcy resembles privatisation, because it also provides a possibility to have a new owner.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the law, new owners of bankrupt companies would inherit their property but not their debts, and Molokanov said this could be of interest to potential investors.</p>
<p>Mutual debts of Kazakh companies have already exceeded one trillion tenge, and their troubled finances are one of the main reasons why salary and pension arrears, now amounting to 60 billion tenge, have built up, fuelling social tension.</p>
<p>The authorities of the Central Asian state believe the new law would accelerate the liquidation of insolvent companies. Last year only 98 companies were liquidated. Another 23 are awaiting the same procedure this year.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy cases of large enterprises on which the economies of whole towns and their social infrastructure depend would be &quot;examined by the government separately&quot;, Molokanov said.</p>
