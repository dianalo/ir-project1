<p>The Dutch Central Planning Bureau (CPB) said on Thursday that initial calculations indicated the government would have some six billion guilders at its disposal for deficit reduction and tax relief during the next cabinet period between 1999-2002.</p>
<p>&quot;If the actual growth in expenditure does not work out higher or lower than the calculated 20 billion guilders, six billion guilders (leeway) will remain to reduce the tax burden and the (budgetary) deficit in the next cabinet period,&quot; the government agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>Stressing that the calculations were a book-keeping exercise, CPB said that barring policy changes in a cautious scenario, net collective expenditure over the next four-year administration was set to rise by some 20 billion guilders, based on 1998 prices.</p>
<p>It said that based on the same criteria and an unchanged government deficit of 2.2 percent of gross domestic product, collective revenues were set to rise by some 26 billion guilders over the same period.</p>
<p>CPB said that the calculations, contained in a memorandum published today entitled &quot;Accounting calculation (of) 1999-2002 budgetary leeway&quot; were intended as an aid to formulating financial and economic policy under the next administration.</p>
