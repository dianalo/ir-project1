<p>The 12.59 percent 2004 bond was up from its weekend close but other Indian government securities were little changed in afternoon trade Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>In latest deals, the 12.59 percent 2004 stock was traded at 106.60 rupees against its weekend close of 106.29. The 12.14 percent 2000 was marginally up at 104.30 against 104.28 while the 10.85 percent 2001 was quoted 100.65/70 against 100.60.</p>
<p>&quot;The 12.59 bond is in active trade today as its maturity is just one year less than the new bond to be auctioned today,&quot; said a foreign bank dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;Some players are taking positions in this stock.&quot;</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) auctions 30 billion rupees of eight-year central government bonds later on Monday.</p>
<p>Market expectations on the cut-off yield varied widely from 11.23 percent to 11.40 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Most players are waiting for the auction results...trade will pick once results are known,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;We can then take a view on liquidity and yields.&quot;</p>
