<headline>Tax havens flourish despite govt barriers - report.</headline>

<p>Tax havens are flourishing and proliferating and will be an important part of the global investment industry in the next century, despite attempts by governments to block flows of funds to them, a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) says.</p>
<p>&quot;(The report) shows just how deeply the tax rates of Germany and other high-tax countries bite, and how attractive it is for taxpayers to move elsewhere if they can,&quot; the EIU said.</p>
<p>In 1996 over one third of the world's offshore private wealth was estimated to be with Swiss financial institutions, while the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the Turks, Caicos and other Caribbean havens held barely 10 percent between them.</p>
<p>New locations are constantly appearing and rivalry to establish a competitive edge is fierce. They are benefiting hugely from rapidly developing information technology which allows even tiny Niue, an island in the South Pacific, to thrive on the crumbs from the global offshore wealth table.</p>
<p>Industry sources estimate that some 60 percent of all money in collective investment funds globally is held offshore. But although tax havens welcome the assets, few want the owners of the private fortunes as residents. &quot;The 1990s have seen the emergence of a network of niche tax haven product providers, with increasing number of countries offering carefully targeted tax incentives as the overall volume of business increases,&quot; said report author Caroline Doggart.</p>
<p>&quot;The winning fiscal refugees will be those offering the best niche products with the best management.&quot; It names Labuan, Mauritius and the Cook Islands as particularly effective.</p>
<p>But &quot;revenue poaching tax havens have put the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU) on the fiscal warpath,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Separately, both have flagged tax harmonisation moves.</p>
<p>But the challenge comes as much from within Europe as from outside -- Andorra, the Azores, the Canary Islands and Gibralter are already established while Corsica and Trieste recently moved to register as tax havens.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be political suicide for any administration to end well-established tax incentives on which whole industries and thousands of jobs depend,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain would be unlikely to give up their preferential corporate tax regimes for the sake of possible harmony.</p>
<p>&quot;The German government is particularly opposed to the investor-friendly tax regimes of Ireland and Luxembourg, which German investors have found to be irresistable,&quot; the report noted.</p>
<p>It also looks at the &quot;dark side&quot; of the business -- the use of offshore centres for the laundering of proceeds from organised crime. It said many countries have passed laws and &quot;strong-arm tactics have crept into government campaigns against tax havens expecially those in the US&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Certain Caribbean havens have become both staging posts for the drugs trade between South and North America and laundries for funds derived from trafficking and other organised crime,&quot; the EIU said.</p>
<p>It added that parts of the Mediterranean are similarly threatened, putting the tax havens of Cyprus, Gibralter and Malta at risk.</p>
