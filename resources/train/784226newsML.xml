<p>Sixteen-year-old world number one Martina Hingis erased 18-year-old Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France 6-2 6-2 in the second round of the $450,000 Acura Classic Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I won another match,&quot; the Swiss teen said. &quot;I feel pretty good.&quot;</p>
<p>While Hingis cruised into the quarter-finals, second seed Monica Seles survived and Amy Frazier thrived in their second-round matches on the sweltering centre court.</p>
<p>Seles outlasted stubborn Sandrine Testud of France 6-7 (6-8) 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 in a two-hour, 23-minute tussle and Frazier, the 1994 titleholder, stunned third-seeded and fifth-ranked Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 6-1 6-3 in just 69 minutes.</p>
<p>Defending champion Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva gained the quarter-finals as well. The fourth-seeded American crushed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia 6-1 6-1 while Zvereva, of Belarus, edged Rumanian Ruxandra Dragomir 6-2 4-6 7-6 (7-4).</p>
<p>Hingis is seeking her 10th title of the year and third in as many weeks in California.</p>
<p>&quot;Success is my biggest motivation  you can get,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't like to lose, no one likes losing.&quot;</p>
<p>The reigning queen of Wimbledon and the Australian Open displayed her smooth-stroking all-court game to wear down Sidot despite being out-hit 18 winners to 11 during the 59-minute match. However, Hingis's 10 unforced errors were half as many as the error-prone lefthander.</p>
<p>Seles was relieved to gain a measure of revenge against Testud, who knocked her off in the round of 32 at Wimbledon last month.</p>
<p>&quot;It was such an up-and-down match,&quot; said the former world number one, who has slipped two spots. &quot;It was the just the same match as when I played her at Wimbledon. It's just that today I was the lucky one.&quot;</p>
<p>Seles wasn't so lucky early on. She squandered a pair of set points and survived four more in the tiebreaker before committing two of her 29 unforced errors to give the set away.</p>
<p>&quot;I got down on myself very hard at the beginning of the second set,&quot; she said. &quot;I was making too many unforced errors and playing her game. I said, I'm not going to let this happen -- win or lose, keep attacking.&quot;</p>
<p>That might not have mattered, though, if Testud had not gotten blinded by the sun.</p>
<p>&quot;At 5-3 (in the second set), I couldn't serve. I couldn't see the ball,&quot; Testud said. &quot;That was the only moment in the match that my toss was right in the sun. I couldn't serve as hard and it made a big difference.&quot;</p>
<p>Seles immediately capitalised with a break and won the tiebreaker to force a deciding set. Seles got the only break of that set to go ahead 5-3, and claimed the victory moments later when Testud banged a forehand long on match point.</p>
<p>Coetzer had beaten Frazier in both career meetings, including a straight-sets win at this year's French Open. But the American's groundstrokes were as hot as the sizzling court temperatures.</p>
<p>&quot;She has the type of game where she goes for a lot,&quot; Coetzer said. &quot;She made quite a lot of shots and I felt like I didn't put a lot of pressure on her. It's a lot easier to make those shots when you don't have a lot of pressure on you.&quot;</p>
