<p>A World Bank mission was due to start talks on Saturday with Bulgaria's interim cabinet on structural reforms and a funding programme to help the Balkan country overcome a grave economic crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Funding will depend on the extent and speed of implementation of reform programmes and investment projects,&quot; World Bank Sofia resident representative Alberto Musalem told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>A World Bank team led by South East Europe department director Kenneth Lay, was expected in Sofia later on Friday.</p>
<p>The delegates were due to meet Finance Minister Svetoslav Gavriiski, interim Prime Minister Stefan Sofianski and President Petar Stoyanov on Saturday.</p>
<p>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended desperately needed funding for Bulgaria last year after the ruling Socialists failed to carry out planned structural reforms.</p>
<p>The Socialists stepped down from power earlier this month after 30 days of massive protests fueled by economic hardship. They agreed to opposition demands to hold early general elections on April 19, 20 months before the end of their term.</p>
<p>Stoyanov, elected with opposition support, appointed an interim cabinet which inherited paralysing fuel and bread shortages, stagnant industry and enormous debts.</p>
<p>Bulgaria pledged last year to close 64 loss-making state firms which would have reduced 28 percent of government subsidy costs, and to isolate from lending and stabilise a further 70 companies which would have cut 50 percent of the losses.</p>
<p>&quot;Implementation of the isolation programme is progressing satisfactorily. Liquidation and privatisation have achieved about 65 percent of targets,&quot; said Musalem.</p>
<p>But costs have been reduced by only 16 percent to date as far as actual closure and privatisation were concerned.</p>
<p>Bulgaria had privatised 17 percent of long-term assets by January this year, compared to a target of 25 percent. This includes 4.2 percent cash privatisation and 13 percent offered for mass sell-offs in the first round, which was recently completed.</p>
<p>Some 14,200 workers, laid off from 11 privatised firms and 30 closed ones have received severance payments under a $25 million World Bank rehabilitation loan. So far 56.6 percent of the workers from state companies slated for closure were laid off.</p>
<p>The World Bank lending programme for Bulgaria currently comprises 10 projects worth $463.5 million of which $97.5 million have been disbursed so far.</p>
<p>Bulgaria relies on external lending for around one billion dollar of debt payments due this year, a third of which is in the first quarter. An IMF negotiating mission is also due in Sofia next week.</p>
<p>Dealing with Bulgria's 1.7 trillion lev domestic debt will also be a key item in discussions with the two lending institutions.</p>
<p>Maintaining prices at levels sufficient to fully cover costs of utilities like power, heating and transport will also be on the World Bank.</p>
