<p>Several Iraqi businessmen have left to visit Damascus to boost trade ties between Iraq and Syria, severed over the last 17 years, the official Iraqi news agency INA said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;An Iraqi industrial delegation headed by Adnan al-Qudsi, chairman of the Iraqi Industries Union, left for Damascus for a seven-day visit,&quot; INA said.</p>
<p>The visit comes as Syrian officials began talks in Baghdad on Wednesday on border demarcation between the two Arab neighbours.</p>
<p>Iraq and Syria decided two months ago to reopen their borders for trade, closed since 1980 when ties were cut because Damascus sided with Iran in the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war.</p>
<p>Since July the two states, ruled by rival factions of the Baath party, have been exchanging economic teams.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit of the (Iraqi) delegation...is within the framework of boosting brotherly relations and consolidating joint cooperation in economic, trade and industrial fields,&quot; INA said.</p>
<p>It said the delegation was invited by the Syria's Chambers of Commerce Federation.</p>
<p>Iraq wants to buy from Syria food and other humanitarian goods under its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations which allows Baghdad oil sales worth $2 billion over six months to buy urgent needs for Iraqis, suffering from U.N. sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The deal, which started in December last year, was renewed for another six months in June.</p>
