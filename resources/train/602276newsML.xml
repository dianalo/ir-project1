<p>Turkish Cypriot representative Osman Ertug has accused Cypriot U.N. envoy Nicos Agathocleous of exploiting the issue of abandoned property for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan circulated on Wednesday, Ertug referred to a recent call by Agathocleous for the U.N. chief to prevent the sale of two hotels in the Turkish-held north of the island that he said were owned by Greek Cypriots.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of abandoned property is common to both communities,&quot; Ertug said, referring to the virtual partition of the island since 1974, when troops from Turkey took control of the north after a coup in Nicosia backed by the junta ruling Greece at the time.</p>
<p>&quot;The Turkish Cypriot community has left a comparable amount of immovable property in the south as the Greek Cypriot community has left in the north,&quot; said Ertug, who represents the Turkish Cypriot community in dealings with the United Nations.</p>
<p>This was a matter to be taken up at inter-communal talks in the framework of a bi-communal, bi-zonal federal settlement, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The exploitation of this issue by the Greek Cypriot side for propaganda puropses is clearly aimed at prejudicing a bi-zonal settlement, which has been universally accepted as a fair and realistic solution,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As regards the sale of immovable property in the north, this is totally within the authority and jurisdiction of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,&quot; he said, referring to the state proclaimed in 1983 but recognised only by Ankara.</p>
<p>&quot;It should also be pointed out that the Greek Cypriot administration, which is guilty of confiscating Turkish Cypriot properties and driving the Turkish Cypriot population into 3 percent of the island's territory between 1963-74, is currently allowing the use, development and even transfer of Turkish Cypriot properties in the south,&quot; Ertug added.</p>
