<p>China's central bank supports the Hong Kong currency's peg to the U.S. dollar, the official People's Daily on Sunday quoted central bank governor Dai Xianglong as saying.</p>
<p>Dai, governor of the People's Bank of China, was also quoted as repeating a pledge not to use the huge foreign exchange reserves of the territory after it returns to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank supports the idea of (the Hong Kong dollar) being pegged to the U.S. dollar,&quot; the newspaper quoted Dai as saying.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's currency, the Hong Kong dollar, is pegged at 7.8 to one U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>While China has not officially pegged its currency, the yuan, to the dollar, it has successfully maintained a stable exchange rate of about 8.3 yuan to one dollar.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, which will become a Special Administrative Region of China, has been expressly given permission to maintain its own currency after the end of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>It will continue to exercise no foreign exchange controls even though China's currency is not fully convertible.</p>
<p>China's currency will be treated as foreign currency if used in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong dollar will remain a foreign currency in China's interior, Dai said.</p>
<p>&quot;China's interior will not use the foreign currency reserves of Hong Kong or its other assets,&quot; Dai said.</p>
<p>He also repeated pledges that the central bank will not set up branches in the territory where monetary affairs will be regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.</p>
<p>China's financial organisations will have no special privileges in Hong Kong and must abide by local laws and regulations, Dai added.</p>
<p>Financial affairs between China's inland areas and Hong Kong will be conducted according to international financial practices. Debt and credit between banks and enterprises of the two places will be treated as foreign debt and credit.</p>
<p>Chinese enterprises listed on the Hong Kong stock market will continue to be treated as foreign listings subject to rules and laws of the territory, Dai said.</p>
