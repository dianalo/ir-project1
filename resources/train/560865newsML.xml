<title>USA: NYMEX electricity seen up with OTC prices, SW heat.</title>
<headline>NYMEX electricity seen up with OTC prices, SW heat.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX electricity futures were called to open sharply higher Monday amid stronger prices in the over-the-counter (OTC) market and firm air-conditioning demand in parts of the Southwest.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a hundred degrees in the Southwest. Things (prices) are running,&quot; said an East Coast electricity dealer.</p>
<p>Forecasters said the Phoenix-Tuscson area in the Arizona would likely 100 hundred degree F mark today.</p>
<p>The heat in that part of the Southwest could send daily power prices higher and continue to lend strength to the power complex which rallied Friday, market sources said.</p>
<p>In early OTC activity, May California-Oregon Border (COB) futures were quoted at $15.60-15.85 a megawatt hour (MWh) versus Friday's settlement at $15.00, while May Palo Verde (PV) at $21.50-21.70 against Friday's close at $20.75.</p>
<p>NYMEX June Henry Hub natural gas futures opened down 3.7 cents at $2.230 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Market sources said a downturn in gas prices would not dampen the rise in power futures.</p>
<p>Generation capacity in the western U.S. remained tight.</p>
<p>About 8,000 megawatts (MW) of generating capacity in the West is said to be currently offline for repairs or maintenance, although much of that capacity was expected to return to service later this month.</p>
<p>In its latest six to 10 day outlook, Weather Services Corp said temperatures in the Northwest would average well above normal with near normal precipitation, while readings in the Southwest would run above to well above normal normal with little or no precipitation.</p>
