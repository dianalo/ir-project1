<title>NEW ZEALAND: Seafresh defers Orange Roughy profit.</title>
<headline>Seafresh defers Orange Roughy profit.</headline>

<p>Seafresh New Zealand Ltd on Monday said it estimated that projected earnings of NZ$4.0 million for the year ending September 1996 may be reduced by up to 50 percent because the company was unable to process its Orange Roughy catch prior to balance date.  </p>
<p>&quot;This has arisen because of an outstanding catch of Hoki this season with the result that the company has been unable to process its record Orange Roughy catch prior to balance date,&quot; Seafresh said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Because Seafresh processes Hoki and sells it fresh, it was decided this catch had to take precedence in the processing facilities which were fully utilised due to the volumes involved.&quot;</p>
<p>Seafresh said the season's Orange Roughy catch could be processed from frozen and had therefore been accumulated in unprocessed form in cold storage.</p>
