<title>UK: BTR shares rise on disposal hopes.</title>
<headline>BTR shares rise on disposal hopes.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-09</dateline>

<p>Shares in industrial conglomerate BTR Plc rose in early trading on Monday after it was announced by the buyers in Taipei that BTR is selling its stakes in three Taiwan petrochemical firms.</p>
<p>The stock was up 5p at 265-1/2 by 0709 GMT.</p>
<p>British newspaper reports over the weekend had anticipated the sale and also said BTR is likely to cut its dividend by as much as 40 percent in its half-year results on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders said a hefty dividend reduction had already been discounted in the share price.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is definitely good news, BTR is out of Taiwan Polymer. It was difficult to predict where it was going and had high operation gearing which meant, if markets turned down, BTR would not have been able to resort to its traditional methods of reducing costs,&quot; said Geoff Allum, diversified industrials analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.</p>
<p>Allum said the Taiwan Polymer disposal alone would not be reason to change his &quot;hold&quot; recommendation on the stock.</p>
<p>He said analysts would await Thursday's half-year results report to see by how much BTR was poised to slash its dividend, as expected.</p>
