<p>China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is in good health, but it will be difficult for him to visit Hong Kong in mid-1997 when the British colony reverts to Chinese rule, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;To my knowledge, it is very good,&quot; Zhang told reporters when asked about Deng's health at a Christmas reception for diplomats and foreign journalists in Beijing.  </p>
<p>Zhang, who is believed to be close to the Deng family, said he had not visited the patriarch recently but that Deng was in Beijing.</p>
<p>Asked if Deng would visit Hong Kong for the handover ceremony, Zhang said: &quot;He said it himself -- he will go to Hong Kong even it means in a wheelchair.&quot;</p>
<p>But Zhang added: &quot;It would be difficult for him to go now. It would be disastrous for an old man in his 90s to catch cold. Catching cold would be a serious illness.&quot;</p>
<p>Deng, 92, no longer holds any office but remains highly influential. He has not been seen in public since early 1994. His health is a matter of intense speculation in China and neighbouring countries because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him.</p>
