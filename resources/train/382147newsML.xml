<title>AUSTRALIA: Wife publishes love letter to spouse denying split.</title>
<headline>Wife publishes love letter to spouse denying split.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-02-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The wife of one of Australias most senior policemen on Tuesday published an extraordinary letter to her husband on the front page of a Sydney tabloid newspaper, declaring her love and denying rumours of a split.</p>
<p>&quot;Sweetheart, I love you. Dont let the bastards get you down,&quot; wrote Adrienne Ryan, whose husband Peter Ryan is police commissioner in Australias most populous state, New South Wales.</p>
<p>Adrienne Ryan, who returned to Britain two weeks ago to finish a university course, wrote the letter to the Sydney-based The Daily Telegraph newspaper after recent reports in Australian media of a marriage break-up.</p>
<p>Peter Ryan, a Briton, was appointed in 1996 to head the New South Wales force, wracked by revelations of widespread corruption.</p>
<p>Adrienne Ryan, a former London police officer more than 15 years younger than her husband, said she would follow him &quot;to the ends of the earth&quot; and accused disgruntled police of spreading rumours of a marriage split to undermine his leadership.</p>
<p>&quot;If they think for a moment that petty innuendo can affect him professionally then they have failed to get the true measure of the man,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I suggest they think again and think fast. This man is here to stay and he will see the job through with his family by his side.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ryans have two young daughters.</p>
<p>&quot;I adore my husband for he is all that anyone could ask of a husband and father: devoted, loving and caring without reservation, and we have a strong and enduring marriage,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p>The New South Wales police force is Australias oldest and largest, but it has also been regarded as the most corrupt.</p>
<p>Peter Ryan was national director of the Police Training College in England when he was appointed to his new Australian job last June.</p>
