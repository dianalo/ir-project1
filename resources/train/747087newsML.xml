<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-22</dateline>

<p>RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp on Tuesday reported that international tobacco sales and operating profits were stronger than the first quarter while domestic tobacco earnings held steady.</p>
<p>Domestic tobacco operating profit rose to $395 million from $390 million in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>International tobacco operating profit rose to $179 million from $162 million in the second quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sales, volumes and operating profit growth strengthened versus the first quarter. International tobacco showed strong volume and operating profit advances and domestic tobacco's earnings held steady,&quot; said Chief Executive Steven Goldstone.</p>
<p>Excluding a one-time restructuring charge and related expenses at Nabisco in the 1996 second quarter, net income of $243 million or $0.71 per fully diluted common share for the second quarter of 1997 represents an 11 percent gain compared to the $219 million or $0.64 fully diluted common share of net income reported in the comparable 1996 quarter.  </p>
<p>Excluding a negative impact of currency translation due to the strengthening of the dollar, operating company contribution would have increased $37 million over 1996.</p>
<p>The company also said that if exchange rates continue at the same level for the remainder of the year, second-half results will also reflect a negative translation.</p>
<p>Internationally, overall volume was up during the quarter 13 percent. The company said the most significant volume gains were drawn from Central European markets as well as from markets in the former Soviet Union.  </p>
<p>Domestically, the company said the Camel brand remained the strongest performer with shipment increases of 8 percent for the quarter.</p>
<p>In its food group, the company said its gains reflect the growth of core biscuit brands, productivity improvements and strong growth in nuts and confections.</p>
<p>Partially offsetting this performance was a &quot;significant&quot; profit decline in Brazil, soft earnings in some domestic product lines and the transition effects of a domestic sales force reorganization.</p>
<p>Domestic food group's net sales were $1.55 billion.</p>
