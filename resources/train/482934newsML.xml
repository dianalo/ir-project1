<p>The Oklahoma City bombing trial crawled through a second day of jury selection on Tuesday with one potential juror staring at defendant Timothy McVeigh and wondering how such a nice looking &quot;kid&quot; could be responsible for 168 deaths.</p>
<p>McVeigh, who has pleaded not guilty to planting the bomb that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building, stared back with a blank expression while his father, sitting in a front row, hung his head.</p>
<p>It was one of several moments that relieved the tedium of a long day of jury selection that legal experts predicted would stretch into weeks, lasting well past the April 19 second anniversary of a crime that represents the worst bombing attack committed on American soil.</p>
<p>A car painter, a philosopher, a social worker, a stagehand who is an expert in theatrical explosions, a crying woman suffering from stress, a devout Christian opposed to the death penalty and a recent college graduate were quizzed thoroughly by lawyers and Federal District Judge Richard Matsch, who were searching for potential jurors.</p>
<p>McVeigh officially is on trial for the &quot;use of a weapon of mass destruction&quot; and the murder of eight federal officials. A second defendant, his former Army buddy Terry Nichols, will be tried separately later. Nichols turned 42 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For the first time, Matsch dismissed a potential juror, letting the woman with stress problems go because she did not know if she could stand the pressure. She was already in tears when she was asked the first question.</p>
<p>McVeigh, wearing a button-down Oxford cloth blue shirt and pressed khaki pants, followed the proceedings closely, looking at times as friendly as the boy next door and thin-lipped and stern at other moments.</p>
<p>He laughed loudly when jokes were made but went expressionless when one juror, a social worker, said she could not believe that someone who looked as nice as him could have killed 168 people.</p>
<p>The woman, who like other potential jurors was not identified for security reasons, said of McVeigh: &quot;He looks like a nice kid ... It is overwhelming for me to think that this person who looks like an average kind of person could do such a thing. This was a pretty awful thing. It's hard to imagine that someone could think up all of this.&quot;</p>
<p>In two days only 13 people have been questioned from a jury pool of more than 350. The judge has to find 64 possible candidates to form a jury of 12 plus six alternates so that the evidence against 28-year-old McVeigh can be heard.</p>
<p>A college philosophy teacher followed shortly after, complaining that a 40-page questionnaire he was asked to fill out was badly phrased. He turned his questioning into a seminar, explaining his complicated Ph.D. thesis and criticising the death penalty because death is final.</p>
<p>Jurors opposed to capital punishment cannot be chosen because the charges against McVeigh carry the death penalty.</p>
<p>Asked several times if he could consider the death penalty if McVeigh was found guilty, he conceded he would consider anything, including &quot;whether or not we may all be dreaming.&quot;</p>
<p>An IBM compter specialist who described herself as a devout Christian was the last potential juror to be called for the day. She said she would not be comfortable imposing the death penalty unless it was a heinous crime and there was no shadow of a doubt. &quot;I feel mostly it is God's job to judge,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Another potential juror, a stagehand at the Denver convention centre, told the judge he had presided over a lawsuit a man had brought and had &quot;rendered a reasonable opinion.&quot; The judge said &quot;For once&quot; and the potential juror said: &quot;It wasn't in my favour, sir.&quot; The whole courtroom burst into laughter, including McVeigh.</p>
<p>Matsch seemed eager to speed up questioning of potential jurors, several times snapping testily at attorneys. He cut off defence attorney Stephen Jones after a lengthy examination of one potential juror.</p>
<p>Matsch, known for his temper, said, &quot;I believe you have had more than an adequate time to examine this witness.&quot;</p>
