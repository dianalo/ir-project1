<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to issue a new milk label rule on Wednesday that will rename two percent milk &quot;reduced fat&quot; instead of &quot;low-fat,&quot; an FDA spokeswoman said Tuesday.</p>
<p>In addition, the agency said the rule will allow skim milk to be called &quot;fat-free&quot; or &quot;no-fat.&quot; One percent milk will hold on to its &quot;low-fat&quot; moniker.</p>
<p>The FDA was galvanized to act after food law implemented in 1993 specified &quot;low-fat&quot; food contain no more than three grams of fat in a serving. By contrast, a typical eight ounce glass of two percent milk has almost five grams of fat.</p>
<p>The milk rule, which will be published in the Federal Register, goes into effect in January 1998. FDA estimates it will cost milk producers about $1.5 million overall.</p>
<p>The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group which has been pressing for the changes since 1987, applauded the FDA's action, saying the new labels would help consumers choose healthier dairy products.</p>
<p>&quot;The FDA's previous labelling scheme misled consumers into thinking that 2% milk was low in fat, and many people switched from whole to 2% thinking they had sharply cut their fat intake,&quot; CSPI's Bruce Silverglade said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;While 2% milk is certainly more healthful than whole milk, 2% milk is not a low-fat food,&quot; he added.</p>
