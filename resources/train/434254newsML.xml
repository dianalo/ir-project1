<p>English first division soccer club Sheffield United Plc said on Tuesday it was hoping to achieve promotion to the premier league this season, a year earlier than it had bargained for.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal in our business plan was for promotion next year. If it comes a year earlier we'll be turning cartwheels,&quot; said chief executive Charles Green.</p>
<p>United are currently fourth in the division. The top two are promoted automatically while the clubs who finish between third and sixth play off for a place in the big money premier league.</p>
<p>Green was speaking as United announced its maiden interim results following the completion in January of a reverse takeover by leisurewear company Conrad Group.</p>
<p>Pro-forma figures for the enlarged group showed a pre-tax loss of 1.3 million pounds in the six months to December 31, 1996. Most of that loss was caused by a 1.1 million pound deficit on transfer fees.</p>
<p>Green said that promotion to the premier league should lift average home attendances from 16,000 to around 22,000, even if United were involved in a relegation battle.</p>
<p>He noted that the bottom club in the premier league next season should receive some six million pounds in television revenue, against a forecast maximum for first division champions elect Bolton Wanderers of 1.25 million this year.</p>
<p>United's Bramall Lane stadium has a capacity of 31,000 and the club has plans to lift this to around 40,000.</p>
<p>It is also planning to develop a hotel on part of the land adjoining the stadium and said it had been in talks with sponsor Vaux Group Plc and Regal Hotel Group Plc about the project.</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy to take the rental income on a 25-year lease (for the hotel),&quot; said Green, adding that United would focus on the soccer side of the business.</p>
<p>Since the end of the reporting period, the club has signed Norwegian striker Jan Aage Fjortoft from Middlesborough and midfielder John Ebbrell from Everton. Green said Fjortoft cost an intial 500,000 pounds, with a further 200,000 to pay while the fee for Ebbrell was 900,000.</p>
