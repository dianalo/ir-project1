<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-01-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds eased on Tuesday amid worries about President Boris Yeltsin's health, and dealers said the market was cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman's testimony due later today.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Jan 21		  Jan 20</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    84.00-84.30	   84.00-84.30</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    59.75-60.05	   59.90-60.20</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    41.75-42.05	   41.90-42.20</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    47.60-47.90	   47.50-47.80</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    35.60-35.90	   35.50-35.80</p>
<p>&quot;Trading started from higher levels, but then eased after support was over,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said banks which had opened positions in MinFins earlier were resisting the rise.</p>
<p>The market was cautious, awaiting Alan Greenspan's testimony to a Senate hearing on the state of the U.S. economy, scheduled for 1500 GMT.</p>
<p>Dealers said Greenspan's comments could affect U.S. Treasuries, whose fluctuations in turn affect most emerging market prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Active selling without support pushes prices down easily. London banks seem reluctant to open positions just in case,&quot; an Aljba Alliance Bank dealer said.</p>
<p>He said resurgent rumours about the state of Yeltsin's health and parliament's intention to discuss his removal on Wednesday were also overshadowing the market.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was recovering at a government residence outside Moscow, where he was working on state papers, but the ailing president had no meetings planned.</p>
<p>The State Duma lower house of parliament was to debate a controversial draft document calling for Yeltsin's dismissal from office for health reasons.</p>
<p>Some Duma members have said the document has no legal force.</p>
