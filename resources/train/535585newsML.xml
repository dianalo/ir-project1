<p>The Indonesian rupiah tumbled to an historic low against the dollar on Thursday on fears about possible unrest during the general election campaign that begins in three days, dealers and economists said.</p>
<p>The currency fell 15 points against the dollar in morning trade before recovering part of its losses.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rupiah plunged because offshore players unloaded the currency fearing unrest or riots during the election campaign, which will start on April 27.</p>
<p>The rupiah dropped through the support level of 2,430.00 in late morning from an opening of 2,420.50, sparking off stop-loss and options-related selling which sent the currency to an historic low of 2,436.0. It later recovered to 2,430.50.</p>
<p>Dealers said the steep fall in morning trade indicated the currency would be volatile in coming weeks and would perhaps stabilise only after the May 29 polls.</p>
<p>&quot;People are just adopting a very cautious tack. I think they are aware that we are entering into a period of event-risk,&quot; Desmond Supple, head of research for Asian currencies with BZW Barclays, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;They are reducing rupiah exposure during this period of potential volatility.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists said dealers and fund operators were neglecting the strong fundamentals of the Indonesian economy and focusing on short-term political uncertainty during the election period.</p>
<p>They noted the World Bank recently praised the country's macroeconomic achievements. They also pointed to the country's comfortable foreign reserves, which rose steadily to $19.872 billion in March from $15.975 billion in March 1996.</p>
<p>However, the sensitive foreign exchange market has switched its focus to politics in the past few days, they said, causing sentiment to turn bearish on the rupiah after a long period as a darling of onshore and offshore investors due to its attractive yield.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect weaknesses in both spot and forward rupiah over the coming few weeks. We are going to see increased volatility and weakness of the rupiah until the elections are out of the way,&quot; Supple said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the fall in the currency was aided by U.S. hedge funds entering the market in the late morning.</p>
<p>Jimmy Koh, an economist at the I.D.E.A. consultancy in Singapore, said U.S. hedge funds were seen unwinding short dollar positions in the spot and forward markets, driving the rupiah to its low.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market would tend to go long on dollars for now.</p>
<p>&quot;That would be an advisable strategy. If you look on a pure risk-reward basis, the rupiah isn't really attractive at the moment. The ringgit and the Thai baht offer greater potential at the moment and are less risky,&quot; Supple said.</p>
<p>However, another Singapore-based economist said the present weakness was temporary and forecast the rupiah would recover once the market's focus switched its focus back to the economic fundamentals after the election.</p>
<p>Supple agreed, adding: &quot;Until the elections are out of the way cautiousness is going to prevail.&quot;</p>
