<p>An Italian military helicopter involved in an evacuation operation from Albania was hit by small arms fire on Friday but there there were no injuries, the defence ministry said.</p>
<p>A ministry statement said the helicopter, an AB-212, was pierced by two bullets while it was acting as an armed escort for other helicopters in an evacuation mission in the capital, Tirana.  </p>
<p>The helicopter was involved in an early morning mission that brought in fresh military guards for the Italian and British embassies and brought out some 100 people, most of them Italian, from Tirana.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday Italy's armed forces evacuated some 500 people, including some 120 British nationals, on helicopters from the port of Durres. Another 400 were evacuated to Italian navy ships in the Adriatic on Thursday.</p>
<p>They were flown to the Italian warship San Giusto and were to be taken to the southern port of Brindisi later on Friday.</p>
