<p>A leading Burundian opposition politician said on Wednesday he was released from jail because of a supreme court order after a week in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>Augustin Nzogibwani, secretary-general of the Frodebu party which was ousted from power by a coup last July, told Reuters that he remained defiant despite being freed on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy to be free but I would be happier still if the thousands...of people still in jail were also released. That makes me very angry,&quot; Nzogibwani said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The Frodebu leader was put under house arrest on February 9 before being transferred to Bujumbura's central prison on February 11 where he said he was held in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>&quot;I was held in total isolation and only allowed 30 minutes of sunshine in the morning and the evening. It was very hard...I just waited for my release and for the minutes of sunshine,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he stood by Frodebu's opposition to an army tactic since last October of &quot;regrouping&quot; Burundi's mainly Hutu villagers into camps guarded by the Tutsi-dominated army.</p>
<p>He was arrested a day after publicly describing the measure as the equivalent of setting up concentration camps. Some 200,000 Tutsis and Hutus have been regrouped in three provinces.</p>
<p>Nzogibwani was accused of inciting civil war, distributing anti-government tracts and making statements detrimental to the peace process, according to relatives.</p>
<p>He said the supreme court had ruled that he should be released because he had been arrested arbitrarily. But he added he had been told proceedings against him would continue.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people have been killed in massacres and a civil war between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels since the killing of Burundi's first freely-elected Hutu president in October 1993.</p>
<p>Regional leaders clamped economic and transport sanctions on Burundi shortly after the July coup in an attempt to force the military-appointed government to open talks with the rebels.</p>
