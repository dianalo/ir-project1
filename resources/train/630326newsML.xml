<p>The National Bank of Poland (NBP) bought currencies on the domestic forex market for the second straight trading day, underlining the zloty's new resistance level of 1.5 percent from the parity rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>The central bank bought some $35-40 million in two waves of dollar and mark buying interventions on Monday, pushing the zloty below 1.5 percent from parity in late trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The NBP again showed it wants to hold the zloty at present levels, but upward pressure on the zloty should be mounting as foreign investors return to the region,&quot; said Witold Wozniak, forex dealer at Deutsche Bank Polska SA.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market will most probably test the central bank's determination to keep the zloty at 1.5 percent,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The zloty closed at 1.49/1.38 percent from the trading band centre, down from 1.53/1.47 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>It closed at 3.2185/00 to the dollar, down from 3.1965/85 on Friday and at 1.8655/89 to the mark, up from 1.8785/95.</p>
<p>The NBP bought dollars at 3.2115 zlotys and marks at 1.8665, when the zloty was about 1.52 percent from parity.</p>
<p>Dealers said some $45 million worth of foreign investor bids at Monday's T-bill tender pushed the zloty higher.  </p>
<p>Less than two weeks ago the central bank defended zloty resistance levels at 2.5 percent from parity before the local unit's fall last week amid foreign investor withdrawal, sparked by the sharp drop of the Czech crown.</p>
<p>Dealers said many foreign investors were discouraged by the central bank's apparent determination to keep the zloty from gaining and refrained from purchasing T-bills on Monday to concentrate on Wednesday's 800 million zloty fixed bond tender.</p>
<p>&quot;If the NBP had not intervened demand would have been higher...but right now foreign investors are more interested in fixed bonds,&quot; said Wojciech Kowalczyk of Bank Handlowy SA.  </p>
<p>At Monday's tender the minimum price of the shorter 8-week and 13-week paper held flat at last week's levels, and inched down one grosz for the longer 26-week and 52-week bills.</p>
<p>The average yield of the 52-week bill inched up to 21.45 percent from the previous 21.40 percent, and to 21.37 for the 26-week bill from 21.34.</p>
<p>On the money market overnight rates eased to 22.25/22.75 percent from the opening 22.40/23.00 as banks let out funds on the first day of the June reserve period. Tomorrow/next closed at 22.20/22.50 percent, down from the opening's 22.60/23.15.</p>
