<title>UK: W.Africa crude trade steady as Asian demand wanes.</title>
<headline>W.Africa crude trade steady as Asian demand wanes.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>August loading programmes for West African crudes have largely been settled and many of the month's first decade cargoes have already been placed, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But business has been relaxed, with slacker buying demand from Asia, poor refinery margins in Europe and a weaker U.S. appetite combining to slow down trade.</p>
<p>&quot;There is just enough demand to keep things ticking over,&quot; said one trader. &quot;A lot depends on what more we see from Asia.&quot;</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean traders said little would change until the results of the Turkish tender for 300,000 tonnes of sour crude were announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The tender has kept the price of Russian Urals high, at around the 67 cents below dated Brent heard paid on Monday, and crippled refinery profit margins.</p>
<p>&quot;We have negative margins on both sweet and sour simple refining in the Med and even with fully upgrading plant we're making practically no money,&quot; said one refiner.</p>
<p>Refineries in Italy have already cut crude throughput and others in southern France were considering the same.</p>
<p>Some West African barrels may eventually head into the Med if refiners need to replace barrels taken by Tupras, the Turkish state oil company believed to have been caught short by the continued absence of Iraqi barrels.</p>
<p>But more attention was being paid by West African traders to the level of eastern demand, which one pegged as running at 750,000 barrels per day for August, about a half of the 1.5 million bpd taken in July.</p>
<p>&quot;It's early days, of course,&quot; the trader said, &quot;but July was an exceptional month.&quot;</p>
<p>Demand was weaker because Asian refineries over-bought in July and margins were poor, particularly after the sharp fall in gas oil prices in Singapore on Wednesday, he said.</p>
<p>In addition the Brent/Dubai spread has widened, making the West African barrels priced off the North Sea Brent relatively dearer, and term prices of competitor crudes from Gulf Arab producers have dropped, he added.</p>
<p>Prices for West African were said to be stable, with Nigerian Bonny Light offered in the high 40s above dated Brent and valued in the mid 40s.</p>
<p>Qua Iboe was valued in the upper 30s, Escravos in the mid 30s and Forcados some 25 to 30 cents above dated Brent.</p>
<p>One South Korean refiner had already fixed a VLCC combo cargo of end-July Ududo and Djeno and a second was heard on Tuesday to have organised a 12-15 August combo loader of Nembe/Cabinda/Palanca.</p>
<p>First decade Escravos and Qua Iboe were believed heading to fill the Indian Oil Company tender, leaving very little left in the first 10 days of the month.</p>
<p>A trading house was heard on Wednesday to have sold a Brass River for a little more than 50 cents above dated Brent a barrel, but further details were not available.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no great scramble at the moment, things are fairly relaxed,&quot; said one sweet crude seller.</p>
