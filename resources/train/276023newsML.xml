<title>JAPAN: Tokyo naphtha barely budges in deserted market.</title>
<headline>Tokyo naphtha barely budges in deserted market.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-12-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Tokyo oil products market saw an extremely quiet day on Wednesday with most Asian markets closed for the Christmas holiday, Japanese traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;With the Singapore and South Korean markets closed, trading is as well as dead,&quot; one naphtha trader said.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha for second-half February was assessed unchanged from late Tuesday levels at $239.50/240.50.</p>
<p>First-half March was quoted about $3.50 per tonne lower than the levels for the latter half of February, traders said.</p>
<p>In inter-month naphtha spreads, first-half February/first-half March was assessed at plus $6.50/7.50.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, it changed hands at plus $7.00.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Chemical said it will slash ethylene production by 10 percent starting in January amid high naphtha prices. As a result, the firm's naphtha purchases will also be cut by 10 percent. The company procures about five million tonnes of naphtha per year.</p>
<p>The cutback has yet to have a substantial impact on the naphtha market as most other major ethylene manufacturers in Japan, except for Sumitomo Chemical, are unlikely to lower their production rates, traders said. Sumitomo Chemical said it may cut ethylene production. -- Tokyo Energy Desk</p>
