<p>Statistics Canada on Friday issued the following economic indicators for August, base 1986=100.</p>
<p>    INDEX			 Month pct  Yr pct     Aug index</p>
<p>    Overall raw materials     +1.3	+5.7	137.9</p>
<p>    Mineral fuels		 +3.7     +25.0	131.0</p>
<p>    Vegetable products	  -5.3     +12.1	144.0</p>
<p>    Animals and products	+2.9	+9.9	123.9</p>
<p>    Wood			    -0.9	-6.8	205.4</p>
<p>    Ferrous materials	   +0.9	-3.2	120.9</p>
<p>    Non-ferrous metals	  +2.7     -17.1	120.5</p>
<p>    Non-metallic minerals     -0.3	+0.5	107.2</p>
<p>    Index ex mineral fuels    +0.3	-1.0	141.1</p>
<p>The raw materials price index reflects the prices paid by manufacturers for key raw materials. Unlike the industrial product price index, the raw materials price index includes goods that are not produced in Canada.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of economists had forecast that the overall index would be rise 0.7 percent from July.  </p>
<p>Statistics Canada said if mineral fuels were excluded from the overall calculation, the raw materials price index would have risen only 0.3 percent in August from July.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices rose 4.0 percent in August, due to strong demand and the restocking of gasoline and heating oil ahead of the long Canadian winter. Crude oil prices jumped 26.7 percent in August from the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada said oil prices could rise even further in the coming months. It said the increased consumption and restocking of depleted refinery inventories had been expected to absorb new oil deliveries from Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;However, with Iraq now on the sidelines, this could add to the potential for even higher prices,&quot; the agency said.</p>
<p>Higher prices for cattle, hogs and copper added to the increase in the cost of mineral fuels in August. The rise in the overall index was partly offset by declines in the prices of grains, logs and pulpwood, Statistics Canada said.</p>
