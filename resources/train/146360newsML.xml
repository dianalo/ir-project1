<title>FRANCE: Corsicans machinegun barracks, blast prison.</title>

<p>Suspected separatists machinegunned a gendarmerie barracks overnight in the third attack on the paramilitary police in as many days on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Gendarmes counted some 15 bullet impacts on the barracks in Oletta, near Bastia. In another attack, a bomb blasted a prison in Casabianda, on the island's east coast, early on Sunday.</p>
<p>The powerful bomb connected to gas containers wrecked the kitchen of the Casabianda jail. The prison houses detainees convicted of sex crimes.</p>
<p>No one was injured in either attack.</p>
<p>The &quot;Historic Wing&quot; of the Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) has claimed responsibility for machinegunning barracks in Bonifacio and firing an anti-tank rocket into the Porto-Vecchio barracks last week.</p>
<p>The attacks, coming after swoops on suspected separatists, were seen as a challenge to the French government which has vowed to crack down on the FLNC after it bombed the city hall in the mainland city of Bordeaux, where Prime Minister Alain Juppe is mayor.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said the attacks would not weaken his determination to fight the guerrillas, and there would not be any dialogue with separatists until violence ended.</p>
<p>&quot;I reiterated instructions to police and gendarmes to continue identifying, detaining and bringing to justice those responsible for the attacks, whoever they are,&quot; he told France Info radio.</p>
<p>He said 22 suspects had been detained since the beginning of this year and would be put on trial.</p>
<p>Twelve suspects in the Bordeaux attack were detained last week. Debre said all but two were later cleared and released.</p>
