<headline>Rebel Tajik colonel's house comes under fire.</headline>
<dateline>KURGAN TYUBE, Tajikistan 1997-08-14</dateline>

<p>The house of rebel Tajik Colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev came under fire from automatic weapons on Thursday, casting doubt on an agreement that halted days of fighting in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Reuters correspondents in Kurgan Tyube, Khudoyberdyev's stronghold, heard his forces respond with anartillery weapon and said he blamed the attack on government troops. There was no word of any casualties.</p>
<p>The Tajik government said on Wednesday the rebel colonel had agreed to withdraw his forces to barracks after peace talks following the fighting around the former Soviet republic's capital, Dushanbe.</p>
<p>Speaking to Reuters minutes before the attack on Kurgan Tyube, 110 km (70 miles) south of Dushanbe, Khudoyberdyev said the government was not fulfilling its part of the agreement and had failed to withdraw its armour to base.</p>
<p>&quot;They do not want to withdraw. I think the president is just powerless now. It is not his fault, it is the fault of certain commanders who want to take control of Kurgan Tyube,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He later blamed the attack on government troops stationed 12 km (eight miles) from his stronghold.</p>
<p>Asked what would happen if the government did not withdraw its troops, Khudoyberdyev said: &quot;Honestly, I think it could only be war.&quot;</p>
<p>He added he still considered himself to be in charge of the elite brigade he has commanded until now, despite an order by President Imomali Rakhmonov removing him from the post.</p>
<p>Fighting erupted between rival armed groups on Saturday, just weeks after Rakhmonov signed a peace agreement with Islamic opposition guerrillas which ended four years of civil war in the country of 5.7 million peopple bordering Afghanistan.</p>
