<p>Sasa Curcic wants to leave premier league title chasers Aston Villa less than five months after his four million pounds sterling ($6.7 million) move from Bolton.</p>
<p>The Serb midfielder said on Friday he was unhappy at Villa Park and regretted leaving Bolton who were relegated to the first division last season.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to leave Villa now,&quot; he said. &quot;Leaving Bolton and joining Villa was the biggest mistake I have made in my life but it will be my last mistake. In future I will follow my heart.</p>
<p>&quot;I am an emotional person and I am just not happy here at all. I can't help feeling I betrayed the Bolton fans by leaving a club where I was so happy. I just looked at the money and the glory of continuing to play in the premier league.&quot;</p>
<p>Villa manager Brian Little said he was &quot;surpised and disappointed&quot; by Curcic's disclosure.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll have to sit down with him and thrash the whole matter out but he cost us four million pounds and I can tell him and any interested club that there are no circumstances in which he will be going anywhere for less than that.''</p>
