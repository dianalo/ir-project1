<p>Home Depot Inc has raised its target for earnings per share growth to 23-25 percent annually over the next two to three years, President Arthur Blank said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Previously, the company's long-term earnings per share growth target was 20-25 percent.</p>
<p>In a conference call with analysts and journalists, Blank attributed Home Depot's more optimistic outlook to a lengthy list of improvements, from enhanced customer service to the opening of a new distribution center in Savannah, Ga.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are very hopeful that for the next two to three years, as we look out, that the annual earnings per share growth for the company will be in the range of 23-25 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blank was speaking after the company reported better than expected earnings for the 1996 fourth quarter. Its earnings were $0.52 a share, compared with a First Call consensus estimate of $0.49.</p>
<p>Home Depot attributed the good results to the strength of its underlying business, and continuing consolidation in the retail home improvement industry, which combined to raise its 1996 market share to 14 percent from 12 percent in 1995.  </p>
<p>Shares in the Atlanta-based retailer were up 1-5/8 to 53-7/8.</p>
<p>Blank said Home Depot will continue to use expansion as its main growth engine, doubling its current 514 units over the next four years. That scale of expansion, he said, would reflect a continuation of its current 21-22 percent annual rate of store growth.</p>
<p>The company expects to spend $1.7 billion in 1997 to fund the addition of 111 new stores.</p>
<p>Blank also said Home Depot would have three new growth initiatives in place by mid-year that would seek to improve sales from professional contractors, strike a more effective product mix, and better utilize store space.</p>
