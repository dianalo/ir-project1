<p>Sleepytime gave trainer Henry Cecil his fifth 1,000 Guineas success when running home an effortless four lengths winner of the first fillies' classic of the season on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 5-1 shot, a brilliant performer on the gallops who had been unlucky in her last two runs, defeated the 50-1 shot Oh Nellie with the 16-1 chance Dazzle three quarters of a length further back in third.</p>
<p>The victory by Sleepytime was a first British classic success for Irish jockey Kieren Fallon. Cecil, given a rousing reception in the Newmarket paddock afterwards, was full of praise for his new stable jockey.</p>
<p>&quot;He is very hard-working and dedicated -- a good horseman,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm thrilled with the filly and the jockey.&quot;</p>
<p>French raider Pas de Reponse, the 5-2 favourite, was kept well up to the pace in the 15 horse field but Freddie Head found that the filly ran out of stamina up the Newmarket hill.</p>
<p>The quietly spoken Fallon said of Sleepytime: &quot;She came good in the end. I had a nice handy position, I got around them and she ran on well. When you are travelling well the gaps open.&quot;</p>
<p>Both Cecil and Fallon felt that Sleepytime still had plenty of improvement in her but Cecil believed the filly would not stay beyond a mile and a quarter (2-km). He may now give her a rest until Royal Ascot in June.</p>
<p>Oh Nellie, ridden by Willie Ryan, sprang from the stalls ahead of Sarayir, Bianca Nera and Pas de Reponse. Fallon, sharply criticised when Sleepytime failed to get a clear run in her trial race at Newbury last month, made no mistake this time.</p>
<p>Fallon hit the front inside the last furlong (200 metres) and powered up the hill for what was a decisive and impressive victory.</p>
<p>Sleepytime, by the Irish stallion Royal Academy, proved a good pick for Fallon who could have also ridden Cecil's two also rans -- Yashmak and Reams of Verse --- who are both recovering from bouts of coughing.</p>
<p>Frankie Dettori had won the first three races of the day and betting shop owners all around Britain were beginning to fear a repeat of last year's Ascot's triumph when he won all seven races.</p>
<p>But his Guineas mount Moonlight Paradise spared the bookies the betting blow they dreaded by finishing out of the places.</p>
