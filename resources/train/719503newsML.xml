<p>Whoever succeeds Gilbert Amelio at Apple Computer Inc. will have to contemplate the death of the company that helped popularise the personal computer -- at least in the form that everyone knows it.</p>
<p>The new chief would have to prepare Apple to survive with perhaps half its annual revenue, estimated at about $8.5 billion in the current year, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>The executive would then have to decide if Apple should become a niche computer maker that can be sold off, like Commodore International Ltd., another PC industry pioneer, or if it should try to transform itself entirely, similar to Wang Laboratories Inc., once a dominant minicomputer maker.</p>
<p>&quot;The old model of creating technology and wrapping hardware around it doesn't work any more in the PC realm,&quot; said Kimball Brown, analyst at market researcher Dataquest. &quot;Microsoft and Intel are creating technology so effectively that you can't be doing what Apple is doing.&quot;</p>
<p>At least Apple has some time to figure out how to shift its strategy. Amelio, who resigned as chairman and chief executive officer Wednesday under pressure from Apple's board of directors, did a good job of temporarily shoring up the company's finances, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;They got about $1.5 billion in cash, give or take,&quot; said Lou Mazzucchelli at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison. &quot;Let's say that revenues will be flattish. They can hang in (for) an easy 18 to 24 months, even if nothing good happened.&quot;</p>
<p>But with sales shrinking, Apple's financial health is deteriorating. Apple also does not have much of a chance of conjuring up a technology that would topple the combined marketing and technical prowess of companies like Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., analysts said.</p>
<p>The trick for the new chief would be to figure out how to salvage Apple's technical wealth and wrap a business around it.</p>
<p>&quot;Companies the size of Apple do not vanish,&quot; said Harry Fenik, vice president at market researcher Zona Research. &quot;In all likelihood, Apple will be acquired. It could happen 52 different ways.&quot;</p>
<p>One way could be for billionaire Larry Ellison, chairman of database software company Oracle Corp., to buy Apple and use its technology for low-cost network computers, Fenik said. The Macintosh's easy-to-use software would work well for the low-cost network machines, which draw their computing power from networks such as the Internet.</p>
<p>If Apple is not sold, it could survive, but would face a fate similar to Commodore, Fenick said. In the 1980s, Commodore produced inexpensive home PCs that were highly regarded at the time. Its Amiga computer is still considered one of the best tools for creating animation.</p>
<p>Commodore went bankrupt in the early 1990s because of management miscues, and rights to the Amiga have passed through the hands of two companies. But the Amiga still has tens of thousands of loyal users, especially in Europe, who keep a cottage industry for software and hardware add-ons going.</p>
<p>Another way for Apple to prosper again could be by splitting itself into two companies, Dataquest's Brown said. One would make personal computer hardware. The other could concentrate on software the way Microsoft sells operating system software and business applications.</p>
<p>Other computer companies that nearly died still survive, partly because they made such radical changes.</p>
<p>Wang Labs, for example, once one of the world's biggest computer companies, made minicomputers and dedicated word processing terminals in the 1970s and '80s. But the rise of the PC eventually drove Wang into bankruptcy in 1992. It then reorganized, using software technology to emerge as a modestly successful document-management business.</p>
<p>Still, faith that Apple could prosper again is fading. Of the 27 Wall Street analysts who track Apple, 21 rate its stock as a &quot;hold,&quot; according to Zacks Investment Research. That rating is often a diplomatic signal to sell. Only four analysts rate the stock as a &quot;moderate buy.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple stock fell 44 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq after touching $12.75, its lowest price in 12 years.</p>
