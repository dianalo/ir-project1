<p>A daylight IRA missile attack on Belfast's main courthouse has further dampened hopes of renewed peace in Northern Ireland, with fears that progress will only be possible after a British general election.</p>
<p>Monday's attack was the first time that the guerrilla Irish Republican Army have struck at the heart of the province's capital since it ended an 18-month ceasefire last February.</p>
<p>&quot;The genie in many ways is now out of the bottle...we are living once again in dangerous times,&quot; Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, told BBC television.</p>
<p>The IRA earlier admitted it had carried out an attack in which an improvised grenade was launched out of the window of a stolen car as it sped past Northern Ireland's Courts of Justice slightly injuring a policeman and a civilian.</p>
<p>It gave an apparently hoax warning that it had planted six bombs in hotels and transport termini, causing the security forces to carry out checks. However, they found nothing.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein's chief strategist, Martin McGuinness, made clear that republicans see little prospect of renewed peace while the present British prime minister remains in office.</p>
<p>&quot;The most constructive contribution that John Major could do tonight towards a search for peace in Ireland is to call an immediate British general election,&quot; he said in a British independent television interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a new government in Britain, we need new imagination.&quot;</p>
<p>McGuinness was immediately accused by unionists who support British rule over Northern Ireland of trying to force Major to call an early poll.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears from the words of Martin McGuinness that the IRA are engaged in a campaign the objective of which is to force a general election,&quot; said Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP).</p>
<p>The UDP has links with a loyalist guerrilla group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, which McMichael said would maintain its ceasefire for the moment despite IRA provocation.</p>
<p>Major must call an election by May 22, but none of the main British political parties want Northern Ireland as a poll issue.</p>
<p>They all agree the IRA must lay down its arms before Sinn Fein can join in talks on the future of the province.</p>
<p>Monday's attack, which followed the discovery last week of a vehicle on the outskirts of Belfast containing 1,000 pounds (450 kg) of explosives, was condemned by the British, Irish and U.S. governments, who have been working together to promote peace.</p>
<p>British Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew accused Sinn Fein of &quot;honeyed words and hard deeds&quot; and said it could not join other Northern Irish parties in talks until the IRA renounced violence.</p>
<p>&quot;Each gangster crime of this kind only serves to reinforce their self-imposed exclusion,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said: &quot;These actions once again call gravely into question the true long-term intentions of the IRA.&quot;</p>
<p>In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, referring to Monday's attack and other recent events, said: &quot;These incidents have shaken the fragile peace in Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
