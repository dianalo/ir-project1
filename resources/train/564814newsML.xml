<p>A Palestinian military court sentenced a PLO policeman on Tuesday to 15 years in jail for killing a man who ignored orders to stop at a checkpoint in the West Bank town of Hebron, a security official said.</p>
<p>&quot;He was arrested and tried by a military court. He was sentenced to 15 years in jail for killing a Palestinian who refused to stop at a checkpoint in a dangerous place in Hebron,&quot; said a senior PLO security official, adding that the incident occurred on Monday.</p>
<p>The official said PLO police ordered the victim, 29-year-old Issam Mohammad Gheith, to stop at a Palestinian checkpoint near an area in Hebron still under Israeli security control.</p>
<p>&quot;But he would not stop and drove around the policemen on the pavement, so one policeman shot one bullet from his pistol and this bullet killed Gheith,&quot; said the official, who refused to be named.</p>
<p>Palestinian forces patrol most of Hebron -- home to more than 100,000 Palestinians -- since Israel handed it over to the PLO under a peace deal in January. Israeli troops guard an enclave inside the city where 400 Jews have settled.</p>
