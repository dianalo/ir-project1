<p>The Australian dollar spent another downbeat session struggling to repair the damage wrought by U.S. sellers in offshore hours, and to little effect.</p>
<p>Traders said the same U.S. investment banks and funds that led Friday's 3/4 cent rout had been back in action Monday taking the currency as low as US$0.7867 before exporter bids appeared.</p>
<p>The sheer speed of its decline from 80 cents left the market technically oversold and a bounce naturally followed, but not very far. &quot;People moved their offers down and down again as the day progressed and no rally came,&quot; said one. &quot;They're ready to sell at 79 now, which does not bode well for A$ optimists.&quot;  </p>
<p>By 5.00 pm (0700 GMT) the local currency was cowering at US$0.7886/91 after retreating from US$0.7915/20 late Monday and US$0.7998/03 this time last week.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the dollar slid to 86.79/89 yen from 87.50/60 late here Monday and to 58.2 in trade weighted terms from a previous 58.4 close.</p>
<p>Traders said it had been briefly supported by early talk of an imminent dual currency samurai issue, but this quickly faded as time passed and no sign of a bond was seen. Some suspected Japanese investors were sitting on their hands ahead of the end of the financial half year on September 31.  </p>
<p>They also feared investors might be cooling on A$ issues because of the risk of a rate cut in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Partial price data only added to the risk with manufacturing input prices off a steep 1.3 percent in July taking the annual fall to 5.6 percent. That was a dramatic turnaround from the start of the year when prices were rising six percent in annual terms and suggested output inflation would also remain subdued.</p>
<p>That would underpin the Reserve Bank's assumption underlying inflation would return to its 2-3 percent target band and remain there for at least a year. With inflation subdued, the RBA could concentrate on its other main objective, reducing unemployment.  </p>
<p>And dollar bulls feared that objective, in effect, meant promoting higher growth through lower interest rates.</p>
<p>Even the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) was tipping another cut before year end.</p>
<p>In its September quarter outlook for commodity prices the government advisory agency said the chances of a further 0.5 point easing were improving given the outlook for continued low inflation and the fiscal tightening announced in the 1996/97 budget. Official rates were cut to 7.0 percent on July 31.</p>
<p>ABARE also did the dollar no favours by revising down its forecast for Australia's commodity export earnings in 1996/97.  </p>
<p>The Bureau still expected earnings to rise 4.3 percent to A$59.72 billion, but that was down from a forecast of A$61.08 billion in the June quarter and A$62.64 billion in the March bulletin.</p>
<p>The revisions seemed to confirm market concerns that world growth was not picking up as fast as had been expected and was not feeding through as quickly to commodity prices as it might have in the past.</p>
<p>Doubters noted falls in oil and base metals Monday had driven the influential Commodity Research Bureau index down to a five-week low at 244.18, 1.67 points off from Friday.  </p>
<p>Such has the policy easing mentality grown that analysts saw an upbeat Westpac business survey as a green light for a cut.</p>
<p>The proportion of manufacturers surveyed predicting an improvement in the general business situation during the next six months improved to 24 percent in the September quarter from 17 percent in the June quarter. However, manufacturing activity continued to decline and selling prices and cost pressures fell. &quot;I think that for any government that was looking at the possibility of cutting interest rates further this survey would be quite a strong reinforcement of that view,&quot; Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans said. -- Wayne Cole 61-2 9373 1800</p>
