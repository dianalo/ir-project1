<p>U.S. municipal bonds rose 1/8 to 1/4 point at midday Tuesday, as traders reported good demand from both retail and institutional clients.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a decent little pickup in flow,&quot; one institutional trader said. &quot;Prices are grinding maybe 1/8 to 1/4 higher.&quot;</p>
<p>A retail trader attributed the better tone to investors looking to reinvest July redemption money, and said the day's new issues were benefitting from the improved tone.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. priced Tuesday's largest tax-exempt issue, a $241 million Sacramento Municipal Utility district, Claif., revenue bond deal.</p>
<p>Goldman tentatively priced the issue, which carried insurance from AMBAC Indemnity Corp. and MBIA Insurance Corp., at a top yield of 5.42 percent in 2022.</p>
<p>On the taxable side, PaineWebber Inc. is handling a $383 million Denver School District No. 1 pension certificates of participation deal. The firm tentatively priced the 2018 maturity at 80 basis points over comparable Treasury securities.</p>
<p>The government market was also slightly higher at midday, but traders said the lack of market-moving data or news was keeping activity levels low. The long bond was up 3/32 at 100-23/32 to yield 6.57 percent.</p>
<p>Friday's release of the Producer Price Index for June was providing one of the few points of interest for the week. Economists surveyed by Reuters expected the figure to remain unchanged overall and up 0.1 percent excluding food and energy.</p>
<p>Economic indicators due later Tuesday included the consumer credit report for May, which economists predicted would be $5.6 billion, compared to $7.6 billion in April.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, bids on Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, Pa., MBIA 5-3/8s of 2024 were unchanged from Monday at 5.53 percent.</p>
<p>Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey FGIC 5-1/2s of 2026 were also unchanged, holding at 99-7/8.</p>
<p>September municipal bond futures rose 6/32 to 119-6/32, while Treasury bond futures gained 3/32 to 113-24/32. The MOB spread widened to 174 from 171 at the close Monday.</p>
