<p>Jacobson Stores Inc said it entered into a new loan agreement with CIT Group/ Business Credit Inc for a three-year revolving credit facility of up to $100 million.</p>
<p>The new agreement, when funded, will supersede a previous facility of up to $65 million, the retailer said.</p>
<p>&quot;In response to a disappointing 1996, our new management team has taken bold steps to restore the Jacobson's tradition of profitability,&quot; said chief executive Gerald Mills, who joined the company in November.  </p>
<p>The company is recruiting new executives, closing three unprofitable stores, and intensifying profitable core merchandise classifications, he said.</p>
<p>Jacobson said sales for the fourth quarter were $141.2 million, up 6.1 percent over a year ago. The company posted a fourth quarter net loss of $3.8 million, or $0.65 per share, as compared with a net profit of $3.2 million, or $0.55 per share, for the corresponding period a year ago.  </p>
<p>Results for the recent quarter were hurt by a $2.73 million net reserve associated with closings of three underperforming stores, a $0.91 million net severance obligation to former senior management and a reduction in gross margin reflecting an acceleration of markdowns for slow moving merchandise, the retailer said.</p>
<p>Fiscal 1996 sales increased 4.4 percent to $432.5 million. The net loss for the year was $11.5 million, or $1.98 per share, as compared with a net loss of $4.2 million, or $0.73 per share, in fiscal 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;At this early stage of our turnaround, we are very encouraged by the positive sales momentum in all markets and the successful opening of our Boca Raton store,&quot; Mills said.</p>
<p>&quot;Already, through the first eight weeks of fiscal 1997, total sales are over 10 percent ahead of the same period last year and comparable store sales are up approximately two percent.  The company's new and expanded credit facility demonstrates the support of our strategy within the financial community,&quot; he said.</p>
