<text>
<p>Mexico's Grupo Televisa reported third-quarter results that were in line with expectations, as the media company slowly rebounds along with the Mexican economy, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, operating cash flow rose 67.8 percent to 430.8 million pesos compared with the same period a year earlier, the company said late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Operating cash flow rose 43.4 percent to 889.6 million pesos in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period of 1995.  </p>
<p>The results &quot;were pretty much in line with expectations, especially on the operating margin level. They confirmed what we thought, that they are starting to see some benefits from the cost-reduction programs,&quot; said DA Campbell Co. analyst Alexander Ryshawy.</p>
<p>The company reported a third-quarter net loss of 43.74 million pesos compared with a net profit of 830.9 million pesos.in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>But much of that loss reflected a non-recurring charge of 58.3 million pesos in the third quarter this year, mainly for cost-cutting.  </p>
<p>The loss was $0.04 U.S. per American depositary receipt compared with earnings of $0.04 in the third quarter last year, Salomon Brothers said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-recurring charges have occurred in each quarter -- reflecting the company's aggressive restructuring -- and Televisa could register additional one-time costs in Q4,&quot; said Salomon Brothers analyst Marla S. Marron.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the loss at the net income level, the company registered strong year-over-year operating and EBITDA improvement. EBITDA advanced by 67.8 percent year-over-year to $0.37 per ADS against our forecast 10 percent increase,&quot; she wrote.  </p>
<p>If the restructuring charge was stripped out, Televisa would have shown a net profit of 14.56 million pesos in the third quarter of this year, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is on-going restructuring. Even though they have charges now... their cost efficiency is going forward,&quot; Ryshawy said.</p>
<p>Net sales from television, which make up 61.4 percent of the total, rose 20.6 percent to 1.66 billion pesos in the third quarter, as &quot;top offs&quot; increased and other sales rose.</p>
<p>Top-offs are advertisements added to a schedule of ads prepaid by marketers under the so-called French Plan.  </p>
<p>The third-quarter top-offs jumped 73.8 percent to a nominal 308.4 million pesos in cash, but the company added that it could not be assured the increase was part of a trend.</p>
<p>Publishing net sales, representing 17.2 percent of sales, fell 5.8 percent to 466,1 million pesos in the quarter.</p>
<p>Audio net sales, making up 8.8 percent of the total, rose 11.5 percent to 239.0 million pesos, primarily on higher sales of recorded music.</p>
<p>One of the biggest surprises was the 30.6 percent decline in cable television sales in the quarter, although analysts pointed out that the segment only represents 3.4 percent of Televisa's total sales.</p>
