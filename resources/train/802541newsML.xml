<p>President Bill Clinton discussed Bosnia with top foreign policy advisors on Friday as the White House said it was &quot;very important&quot; that former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic stand trial for war crimes.</p>
<p>Speaking after Clinton met at the White House with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry made clear the growing U.S. ire with Karadzic.</p>
<p>Under terms of the Dayton accords that halted four years of war, Karadzic -- an indicted war criminal -- pledged to stay out of the political arena. One year later, however, he continues to wield power covertly.</p>
<p>&quot;It's ... very important for all the parties to make good the commitment specifically expressed in the Dayton accords, that he and other indicted war criminals are to play no role in the political life of Bosnia-Herzegovina or the Republic of Srpska,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>Discussing the importance of arresting Karadzic, McCurry told reporters: &quot;He is responsible in the ... indictment for some of the worst genocide in Europe since the Holocaust, so it matters very much.&quot;</p>
<p>There have been news reports in recent weeks that Washington was mapping plans to capture Karadzic, whose continued freedom is viewed as a major obstacle to peace.</p>
<p>Karadzic was indicted during the 1992-95 Bosnian war but no serious effort has been made to arrest him, despite repeated vows by Western powers to bring hime before the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</p>
<p>Karadzic &quot;has the capacity to be a negative influence, and that's long been recognized,&quot; McCurry said, noting, &quot;it's one of the reasons why we have stressed to the parties their obligations to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about a Pentagon announcement that there will be a temporary increase in U.S. troops deployed in Bosnia and the message it was sending Karadzic, McCurry replied:</p>
<p>&quot;He should be concerned that the international community is growing increasingly impatient with the inability of the war crimes tribunal to try the case that he has been indicted for.&quot;</p>
<p>The troop redeployment, part of a regular rotation of forces, means the U.S. contingent with the international peacekeeping force will grow to between 11,000 and 12,000 for several weeks to help ensure security during the mid-September elections.</p>
<p>The United States has just under 8,000 troops in the Balkan state now.</p>
<p>McCurry said no new decisions were made by Clinton at the meeting, which also included the U.S. envoy to Bosnia, Robert Gelbard. &quot;It was a review of decisions that he already has taken,&quot; McCurry said of the president.</p>
<p>Holbrooke and Gelbard updated Clinton on their recent efforts in the region to maintain the peace agreement.</p>
