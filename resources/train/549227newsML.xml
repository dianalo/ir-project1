<headline>U.S. corporate bond spreads flat, CSX deal awaited.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-30</dateline>

<p>U.S. corporate bond spreads were mostly unchanged on Wednesday amid Treasury volatility, although some recent new issues softened, traders said.</p>
<p>But traders said many were attempting to focus on $2.05 billion in debt set to price from CSX Corp. The issue, which may price on Thursday, was restructured on Wednesday to eliminate a tranche of 30-year capital securities in favor of 30-year put eight debt, sources said.</p>
<p>While the deal's 144A status has limited information in the Street, market sources said the deal was &quot;doing well&quot; in the premarketing stage.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the prices of some of the finance related issues to capitalize on Tuesday's powerful market widened when freed to trade. Those frequent issuers are typically tight, traders said and were reluctant to call the broad market weaker. But despite a constant bid, the market still yearned for direction with potent manufacturing and jobs data looming.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks a little overbought in here and many of our accounts haven't stepped into it yet,&quot; one trader at a West Coast firm said. &quot;And people are going to have to set themselves up for the number on Friday and that's going to put a little pressure on the market.&quot;  </p>
<p>Away from new issues, bonds of Tele-Communications Inc were unchanged to firmer based on better than expected operating cash flow results for the first quarter, traders said. Profit-takers held the rally down, some traders said, but longer maturities were still about 10 basis points tighter on the week.</p>
<p>TCI 30-year debt was bid at a 185 basis point spread.</p>
<p>Turning to the high-yields, traders said retail buying reemerged in strength and prices firmed for the second consecutive day. Prices were flat to up 1/4 point, they said.  </p>
<p>New issues traded higher and reinforced the improved tone, players said, adding that several postponed issues, including Comcast Cellular Holdings' $900 million deal, would soon revisit syndicate desks.</p>
<p>At the same time, dealers noted issues were taking on more conservative structures than seen earlier this year.</p>
<p>In the junk bond primary, Telex Communications Inc issued $125 million 10-year senior subordinated notes to yield 10.5 percent via Chase Securities. The notes were quoted at 100-3/8 bid when freed, one trader said.  </p>
<p>The notes were actually sold by GST Acquisition Corp, an entity set up solely for the purpose of carrying out a leveraged buyout of Telex by Greenwich Street Capital Partners.</p>
<p>Treasury prices dropped early after a surprisingly strong report of first quarter gross domestic product. Prices recovered by mid-session, however, thanks to strong techicals and optimism that a U.S. budget pact would be struck.</p>
<p>The 30-year bond closed up 10/32 to yield 6.96 percent.</p>
