<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed down across the board on Thursday on a technical correction after sharp rises on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract plunged to 10.85 percent from 18.00 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell sharply to 2.53 million lots from 5.61 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.  </p>
<p>The rates experienced a rational technical correction after Wednesday's sharp rises, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both volume and rates fell today when fund demand fell sharply after yesterday's big new issue on the Shanghai bourse,&quot; said one trader, referring to Sanxia Shuili, an electricity company who shares debut on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said falls on the domestic A share markets were another factor exerting downward pressure, especially on the early-maturing contracts.  </p>
<p>The volume of a new A share issue on the Shenzhen stock exchange, Shandong Xinhua Zhiyao -- which is also listed as an H share in Hong Kong -- was too small to support Wednesday's repo rates, other traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the rates to fall further, though slightly, on Friday on a lack of fresh market-moving factors.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up on Thursday on a technical rebound after falls in past few days, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded two-year bond that matures in January 1999 rose to 87.20 yuan from 86.79 yuan.  </p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market rose slightly to 681,650 lots from 657,112 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said Thursday's rises were only a technical rebound because the market volume did not increasing accordingly.</p>
<p>As a result, they said, rates should consolidate around current levels in the short term.</p>
