<p>China's southern city of Guangzhou has passed regulations aimed at preventing hospitals from denying emergency treatment to those too poor to pay, officials and state media said on Friday.</p>
<p>The new rules, to take effect from September 25, were intended to stop hospitals from requiring deposits before performing emergency treatment or surgery, an official with the Guangzhou Health Bureau said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;Hospitals must under no circumstances refuse to treat patients who are in a serious condition,&quot; the China Daily quoted the regulations as saying.</p>
<p>Hospitals in the booming city had in some cases been demanding proof of a patient's ability to pay before carrying out emergency operations, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China's hospitals, once virtually free of charge under the egalitarian rule of communist ideologue Mao Zedong, have begun requiring patients to pay as they feel the pinch of cuts in state backing.</p>
<p>The regulations would also try to curb ethical abuses by doctors and nurses, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;Medical personnel must take the initiative to practise sound medical ethics at all times,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Many Chinese doctors, whose salaries are not much higher than that of the average worker, often demand gifts or cash from patients before treating them.</p>
<p>The regulations had raised concerns among hospitals of how to cover the cost of treating those who cannot afford to pay, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;Only those who really have no money will be treated for free,&quot; the official said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;If we started giving free health care, every one in the country would come to Guangzhou for treatment,&quot; he said.</p>
