<title>THAILAND: Burmese rebels attack Thai camp, kill refugee.</title>

<p>A group of breakaway Karen guerrillas attacked and set fire to part of a refugee camp on the Thai side of the border with Burma, killing one refugee, rebel and Thai police sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>A group of about 30 armed men crossed from Burma to attack the Htaperkpu camp, about three km (1.8 miles) inside Thailand in the Umphang district early on Sunday, the sources said.</p>
<p>The intruders opened fire and then burned down part of the camp, destroying 18 houses and killing one man, police said.</p>
<p>About 2,000 Karen refugees live in the camp. Some 6,000 Karen refugees from Htaperkpu moved to a new camp set up by Thai authorities further inside Thailand last month, but those who remained had refused to switch camps.</p>
<p>Police and Karen sources said the attackers were former guerrillas of the Karen National Union (KNU) who earlier this year surrendered to Burmese troops.</p>
<p>&quot;The attackers were our former comarades in arms who defected to the enemy a few months ago,&quot; a KNU source said.</p>
<p>But rebel sources said they were not part of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), a splinter group that broke in 1995 from the predominantly-Christian KNU which has been fighting Rangoon for an independent Karen state since 1948.</p>
<p>The DKBA, which is supported by Rangoon, has staged regular attacks on Karen refugees living inside Thailand. About 100,000 Karen refugees who fled Burma over the past decade now live in sprawling camps near the border.</p>
<p>A Thai security officer based near the camp also confirmed that former KNU guerrillas were responsible for the attack.</p>
<p>Hundreds of guerrillas of the beleaguered KNU surrendered to Burmese troops after Rangoon launched a heavy offensive early this year, sacking mobile KNU camps inside Burma and causing thousands of refugees to flee into Thailand.</p>
<p>The KNU is the last major rebel group still fighting Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Other major groups have signed ceasefire agreements with the SLORC since it seized power in 1988.</p>
