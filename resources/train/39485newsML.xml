<title>USA: AMP enters Internet commerce market.</title>
<headline>AMP enters Internet commerce market.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.</dateline>
<text>
<p>- Electrical and electronic connector giant AMP Inc. on Monday will announce its entry into the Internet commerce market.</p>
<p>Jim Kessler, director of AMP eMerce Internet Solutions, said the new division to be unveiled on Monday was to forge for AMP &quot;a leading position in Internet commerce.&quot;</p>
<p>Kessler said in an interview here AMP's that launch follows five years of testing a variety of new technologies from fax-back product information to CD-ROM and Internet catalogues.</p>
<p>The company plans an October-November pilot of a business-to-business transaction system. In December, AMP will launch a programme that will offer select customers contract pricing, sample orders, literature orders, and 3-D models on demand.</p>
<p>Although seemingly a major new business for the Harrisburg, Pa.-based company, whose 1995 revenues topped $5.2 billion, Kessler said the project sprung from a bid to solve its own internal challenge.</p>
<p>The company markets some 200,000 products worldwide, with customers of many different languages and offerings often varying from country to country.</p>
<p>To provide information about its products, Kessler said, AMP has been spending some $7 million to $10 million a year in publishing some 400 paper catalogues.</p>
<p>With 200 part number changes among AMP's myriad offerings a day, and a nine-month lead time to produce catalogues, these were by definition out of date before they even hit the press.</p>
