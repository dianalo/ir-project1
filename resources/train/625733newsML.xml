<p>Pete Sampras will depart Paris this weekend wondering if he can ever break his apparent French Open jinx after a pre-match stomach upset ruined his chances of success at Roland Garros for another year.</p>
<p>The American world number one, in sparkling form in his opening two rounds at the only Grand Slam event he has never won, lost in four sets to Sweden's Magnus Norman and later attributed his off-colour display to a bout of diarrhoea he suffered the previous day.</p>
<p>The 1995 French champion Thomas Muster also bowed out on Friday, beaten 6-7 6-1 6-3 3-6 6-4 by little-known Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, ranked one place below Norman at 66 in the world but, unsurprisingly, it was Sampras's exit which created the biggest stir.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first couple of sets I felt totally disorientated,&quot; revealed Sampras, who had successfully asked for his match to be played later in the day to allow him maximum time to recover.</p>
<p>&quot;A 24-hour virus has been going around and a bunch of players have got it. I'm sure I got it from someone here.&quot;</p>
<p>It was obvious that all was not well with the top seed when he lost the first set 6-2 with a flurry of unforced errors against an opponent who gleefully seized the opportunity to celebrate his 21st birthday in style.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt sluggish and tired although I felt much better in the third and fourth sets,&quot; said Sampras, who eventually went down 6-2 6-4 2-6 6-4 in two and a half hours. &quot;It's not an excuse, but there always seems to be something that comes up.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, Sampras reached the semifinals despite just one warm-up tournament on clay following the death of his close friend and coach Tim Gullikson from brain cancer, only to lose to eventual champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov.</p>
<p>This time he arrived with a thigh strain but although he is no stranger to physical discomfort, notably in his epic U.S. Open quarter-final against Spain's Alex Corretja last year, the pressure on him to triumph at Roland Garros grows ever more intense.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a continual struggle for me to win here, I know that,&quot; he acknowledged. &quot;It will take me some time to get over it but there are a lot of years left in my career.&quot;</p>
<p>Half of the top 10 men's seeds have now failed to make it beyond the third round, with Kafelnikov almost joining the list of departures before squeezing home 6-4 in the fifth set against France's Cedric Pioline despite a partisan centre court crowd.</p>
<p>The Russian lost the fourth set 6-1 in just 26 minutes and trailed 4-3 in the last before edging out Pioline, ranked 33 in the world, in three hours 31 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;I was really, really tired. Believe me, I don't know what kept me fighting,&quot; said Kafelnikov. &quot;I'm not saying I'm going to win here but it's true I'm more confident than I was a few days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Muster, seeded fifth this time, survived a five-set examination in the first round against Germany's Marc Kevin Goellner and came through a bad-tempered clash with American Jeff Tarango on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But despite leading 3-0 in the final set, he eventually had no answer to the athleticism of Kuerten who he last encountered in a notoriously acrimonious Davis Cup contest between Austria and Brazil in Sao Paulo last September.</p>
<p>Kuerten was one of the players on the other side of the net when Muster stormed off court during the doubles rubber complaining he had been spat on and abused by the crowd, a walkout which led to Austria being fined by the International Tennis Federation.</p>
<p>On neutral ground, however, the Austrian could not escape so easily as the 20-year-old reached the last 16 with what he described as the best win of his career.</p>
<p>&quot;Losing today was very disappointing because I had a good draw and a good chance to go far in this tournament,&quot; said Muster. &quot;I had my chances here and didn't take them, especially in the fifth set.&quot;</p>
<p>In the women's singles, Steffi Graf was forced into only her third tie-break in the early rounds at Roland Garros for a decade by Spain's Magui Serna but still progressed 7-6 6-1.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not at 100 percent yet but every day I go out there I'm feeling better,&quot; said Graf, out of the game for much of this year with a knee injury. &quot;I'm moving around the court a lot better, but the stability in my game is missing.&quot;</p>
<p>Karina Habsudova of Slovakia became only the second women's seed to fall when she lost 6-3 6-2 to Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir.</p>
