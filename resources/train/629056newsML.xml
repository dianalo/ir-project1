<p>An off-duty Northern Ireland policeman was beaten to death overnight, apparently by a Protestant mob, as security forces continued their probe into an aborted IRA attack in west Belfast.</p>
<p>The policeman was beaten to death in a street attack in the town of Ballymoney in Country Antrim. Television reports said at least seven pro-British &quot;Loyalists&quot;, angered by a recent ban on a Protestant march, set on the 45-year-old officer outside a bar in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
<p>A Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) spokesman decline to comment on who was responsible, but said the officer &quot;died from injuries received when he was violently assaulted&quot;.</p>
<p>Protestant hardliners have been infuriated over recent months at being prevented from holding marches in the County Antrim village of Dunloy because of objections by its mainly Roman Catholic Irish nationalist residents.</p>
<p>In west Belfast security forces found a bomb detonation wire as they investigated an IRA claim that it had abandoned a defused landmine in west Belfast, police said,</p>
<p>An Irish Republican Army statement hinted that one of its units had aborted a planned attack on security forces on Saturday and left the landmine in a van in the Poleglass district, a staunch Irish nationalist area.</p>
<p>It was the IRA's first reported hostile action in the province for six weeks, during which Britain has resumed contacts broken off 16 months ago with their political wing.</p>
<p>Protestant politicians immediately called for the tentative contacts to be abandoned.</p>
<p>The car was set on fire overnight following the IRA's claim made in a coded telephone call to a local radio station.</p>
<p>Children told journalists they had played inside the suspicioiusly parked vehicle before the fire and that it contained two containers of white powder.</p>
<p>Police said a security operation was continuing but there was no early sign that they had found any other bomb parts.</p>
<p>&quot;The area has been sealed off. A full clearance operation has begun,&quot; the RUC spokesman said. &quot;A command wire has been found and a (precautionary) controlled explosion has been carried out.&quot;</p>
<p>The IRA, which has frequently left bombs in nationalist zones to catch passing British patrols, said it dumped the bomb after defusing it because civilians were nearby.</p>
<p>Security sources, unsure whether it was a hoax to lure them into a booby trap, said they were treating the alert as a &quot;real terrorist threat&quot;.</p>
<p>Britain ended contacts with the IRA's political arm Sinn Fein in February 1996 when the guerrillas scrapped a 17-month ceasefire by setting off a huge bomb in the Docklands area of London's East End, killing two people.</p>
<p>After winning power on May 1, Prime Minister Tony Blair resumed talks between government officials and Sinn Fein.</p>
<p>But Blair made clear the talks could only take place if the IRA refrained from using violence. Two rounds of talks have been held in the past 10 days and another is due soon.</p>
