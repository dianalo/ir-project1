<p>The threat of terrorism is likely to increase in the United States as the Internet provides easier access to information on making bombs, Defence Secretary William Cohen said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a real threat,&quot; Cohen said at a forum on terrorism held at the University of Georgia. &quot;We are going to see information continue to spread as to how these weapons can be manufactured in a homegrown laboratory.&quot;</p>
<p>He told reporters terrorist attacks such as the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York City and the Oklahoma City federal building illustrate a growing threat. &quot;It's likely to intensify in the years to come as more and more groups have access to this kind of information,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said precautions against unconventional arms must be intensified as potential terrorists develop chemical weapons, germ warfare and electromagnetic methods that could create holes in the ozone layer or trigger earthquakes or volcanoes.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some reports, for example, that some countries are trying to construct something like the Ebola virus,&quot; Cohen said. Ebola, one of the most virulent viral diseases known, is spread by direct contact with body fluids such as blood and kills between 50 and 90 percent of its victims.</p>
<p>There also has been speculation that scientists could develop ethnic-specific pathogens &quot;so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups,&quot; Cohen said at a day-long forum hosted by former Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p>Nunn said he proposed the forum because of recent bombings at the World Trade Centre, Oklahoma City and the Olympics. &quot;We are in a period of terrorism,&quot; he said in his opening address.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a period of the Internet transmitting knowledge to people all over the globe in how to make weapons of mass destruction,&quot; he said. &quot;We are in a new era and it's time for us to recognise it.&quot;</p>
