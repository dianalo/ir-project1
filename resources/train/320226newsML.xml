<title>SOUTH KOREA: S.Korean prosecutors to delay arresting unionists.</title>

<dateline>SEOUL 1997-01-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A senior South Korean prosecutor said on Monday the arrest of seven fugitive union leaders was being delayed because of prospects for dialogue over a controversial labour law.</p>
<p>&quot;The principle of serving the arrest warrants still stands but execution of the warrants is being delayed in view of the prospect of resolving the current situation with dialogue,&quot; the senior state prosecutor said.  </p>
<p>The prosecution official was speaking after a state television report that President Kim Young-sam would meet opposition leaders to discuss the crisis over the law, which allows companies to lay off workers and replace strikers.</p>
<p>Kim had previously ruled out such a meeting, insisting he would neither scrap the law nor revise it.</p>
<p>Seven members of the outlawed Korean Confederation of Trade Unions are sheltering from arrest at Seoul's Myongdong Cathedral.</p>
<p>On Saturday they backed down from a call for indefinate stoppages and said they would only hold strikes once a week on Wednesdays. Prosecutors had previously said the union bosses would be arrested if they did not halt industrial action immediately.</p>
