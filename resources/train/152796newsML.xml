<headline>TENNIS-BECKER BECOMES FIFTH SEED TO CRASH OUT.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Three times champion Boris Becker became the fifth seed to crash out of the Paris Open at the first hurdle when he lost 6-3 5-7 6-4 to Spaniard Carlos Moya in the second round on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The sixth seed, who won the Stuttgart Open on Sunday and was expected to go a long way at Bercy, saved two match points -- the second when the umpire overruled a line call that favoured Moya -- before succumbing after an hour and 55 minutes in his first meeting with the 20-year-old Spaniard.  </p>
<p>The defeat could jeopardise Becker's chances of defending his ATP Tour World Championship title in Hanover next month.</p>
<p>The German world number three, who would have clinched his spot if he had reached the Paris semifinals, is currently sixth in the qualifying places for the eight-man year-end event with several players vying for the three places still not settled.</p>
<p>Fifth seeded Croat Goran Ivanisevic became the fourth seed to crash out in Wednesday's opening match, 6-3 6-2 to Dutchman Paul Haarhuis.</p>
<p>Andre Agassi, Richard Krajicek and Jim Courier all lost on Tuesday.</p>
