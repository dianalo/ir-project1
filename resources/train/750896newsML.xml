<p>-- TREASURY AGREES TO CONSULT COMPANIES ON FIDS</p>
<p>After passing legislation to end the Foreign Income Dividend scheme by April 6 1999 the government pledged to the British multinationals that a thorough consultation plan on the future of the Fid scheme would be implemented. Conservative MPs attacked the government for abandoning the recent Budget feature that allows companies and funds to distribute overseas earnings without incurring UK tax saying that many multinationals may consider relocating if they are to suffer a second corporation tax. Geoffrey Robinson announced that he was prepared to listen to representations offering alternatives.</p>
<p>-- WATCHDOG ACTS TO FORCE 28 PER CENT CUT IN BT'S CHARGES TO RIVALS</p>
<p>Telecoms regulator Oftel has released proposals to cap the cost of charges for other telecom firms using BT exclusive lines. The proposals will mean that BT will be forced to cut charges for the use of its lines where there is no alternative network by 28 per cent over the next four years providing cheaper calls across the telecoms industry and encouraging other companies to set up on the market. BT welcomed the key elements of the move but has until August 22 to officially respond to the 'tough' measures.</p>
<p>-- TESCO BANKS ON AN INDEPENDENT LICENCE</p>
<p>The joint banking venture between supermarket group Tesco and the Royal Bank of Scotland, Tesco Personal Finance, has applied for its own banking licence instead of trading under the Royal Bank as it opens business and launches its new credit card. The Bank of England, which authorises new banks, earlier expressed doubts about combining supermarket management culture and banking.</p>
<p>-- SAFETY-TESTED FOODS TO BE NAMED</p>
<p>Food safety minister Jeff Rooker announced that the identification of food products being tested for safety by the Ministry of Agriculture will be publicly released arousing fears from the Food and Drink Federation that it may give a misleading impression to the public. Mr Rooker commented that the release of safety, nutritional quality and authenticity results on suspect products would allow consumers to make a more informed choice.</p>
<p>-- EU MAY BACK TIGHTER MEAT SAFETY STANDARDS</p>
<p>European Union farm ministers were to vote on the lifting of strict meat safety restrictions after Jack Cunningham, UK agriculture secretary, threatened to ban imports on EU beef unless they met UK safety standards if EU ministers do not accept the lifting of restrictions. A vote last Thursday gave 8-7 against the controls although Portugal and Finland have now proposed to drop their opposition depending upon certain concessions.</p>
<p>-- STRONG POUND HAMPERS EXPORTS IN NORTH</p>
<p>The British Chambers of Commerce national quarterly report's Business Survey North section reveals mixed fortunes in the North of England with improvements in sales and orders but a decline in exports following the growing rise in the pound's strength. In addition the report highlights the growing concern over skills shortages with 69 per cent of manufacturers reporting difficulties compared to 53 per cent and an earlier 47 per cent reported in previous quarters.</p>
<p>-- NISSAN TO BUILD THIRD MODEL IN SUNDERLAND</p>
<p>Car manufacturer Nissan has announced its intention to commence production of a third model of car at its UK plant in Sunderland in addition to the Primera and Micra models already built there. The new car is due to be launched in 2000 and is also being built at the firm's plants in Mexico and Japan as part of a growing trend of 'globalisation' that assists in maximising economies of scale. Component suppliers across Europe will compete for contracts.</p>
<p>-- NATIONWIDE POLL GETS CLEAR RESULTS</p>
<p>In a postal vote by more than 1m of the 3.5m members of the Nationwide the building society has revealed that there is a clear result of the election between five pro- demutualisation candidates and five existing board members. The results could see the 149-year old building society converted into a Bank which may signal the end of mutuality probably forcing others like Birmingham Midshares to merge. Midshares announced the suspension of new accounts opening to stem the surge of carpetbaggers.</p>
<p>-- STRONG POUND REINS IN SMITHKLINE</p>
<p>SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals company, has reported a sharp increase in US sales during its second quarter. However, group sales and profit figures overall were hit by the strong pound, which turned an underlying increase in pre-tax profits for the period from 16 per cent to an actual increase of just 4 per cent. The group warned that the strength of sterling is likely to reduce full-year profits by about 8 per cent.</p>
<p>-- RETAIL SETBACK CUTS MENZIES</p>
<p>Retail and distribution group John Menzies has reported a 5.3m stg fall in profits last year largely due to continuing problems at its Early Learning Centre chain. Sales at ELC are down 5.5 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the first few weeks of this year. Pre-tax profits for the group in the year to May 3 were 30.6m stg, compared to 35.9m stg last time.</p>
