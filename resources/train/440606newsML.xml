<p>Israel's February consumer price index, due to be published on Friday, is expected to rise 1.0-1.2 percent, marking a sharp acceleration from the previous seven months, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A 1.0 percent rise in the CPI for the month would bring the year-on-year inflation rate to 10.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Before we did our new estimate after the end of February, our estimate had been 0.9 percent. The difference is vegetable prices, which rose for climatic reasons, and the strengthening of the dollar,&quot; said Ptachia Bar-Shavit, chief economist at Bank Hapoalim.</p>
<p>Bar-Shavit said he was expecting inflation of as much as 1.2 percent, which is at the upper end of expectations.</p>
<p>Most forecasters, including those at the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce, Israel Discount Bank and the Treasury, cited the same factors but are expecting a CPI of about 1.0 percent.</p>
<p>Since last July, when inflation came down sharply from a high 14.6 percent rate in the first half of 1996, monthly CPIs have ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 percent.</p>
<p>However, the strengthening of the dollar against the Israeli shekel this year will feed into higher prices for homes and imported products, mainly appliances, said Bar-Shavit. Since the start of the year, the dollar has risen about 3.7 percent against the shekel.</p>
<p>Housing prices are customarily set in dollars in Israel, which is why the U.S. currency influences their price.</p>
<p>Most economists said they expected to see high CPIs for the coming months as well, although they are sticking to the earlier forecasts for annual inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just the beginning -- the dollar will influence the CPI over the next three or four months. This month will only partially reflect the strengthening of the dollar,&quot; said an economist at Discount Bank who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Discount is forecasting 10.5 percent inflation for all of 1997, while Hapoalim has recently raised its forecast to 8.7 percent from 8.5 percent.</p>
<p>The impact of the dollar has been mitigated by the weakening of other key world currencies, economists said. The mark has fallen 6.8 percent against the shekel this year and the yen by 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>Economists said a high CPI combined with accelerating money supply growth would discourage the Bank of Israel from cutting interest rates at the end of the month. M1 grew 3.4 percent in January, and the Discount economist said he expected a further expansion of 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent for February.</p>
<p>The central bank, which said on Thursday it would publish its April monetary programme on March 23, a day earlier than usual, has cut the base rate 3.1 percentage points since August to 13.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We've arrived at the end of the cuts,&quot; said the Discount economist. &quot;Maybe we will get another 0.5 percent cut but not this month.&quot;</p>
