<headline>Tabloid leaks news of 57,800 drop in UK jobless.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A British newspaper published leaked figures it said showed unemployment fell a seasonally-adjusted 57,800 in January, hours before they were due for official release on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Daily Mirror said government officials planned to hail the 11th consecutive monthly fall in unemployment at a news conference after the figures were released at 0930 GMT.</p>
<p>The unemployment total in January was 1.8 million, the Daily Mirror said.</p>
<p>If correct, the January fall far exceeds market expectations of a drop of around 30,000.</p>
<p>Unemployment fell by a seasonally-adjusted 45,100 in December to a six-year low of 1.88 million unemployed.</p>
<p>The left-leaning Mirror said raw figures showed that unemployment had in fact risen by 39,000 over the last month and it accused Britain's Conservative government of massaging the figures.</p>
<p>The employment ministry declined to comment on the leak or the accuracy of the figures.</p>
<p>Last November, a large part of the government's annual budget statement was leaked to the Daily Mirror, but the tabloid declined to publish it.</p>
<p>The newspaper's editor said then that he felt it would have been irresponsible to publish market-sensitive information.</p>
