<p>A radical Palestinian alliance of 10 Islamic and secular factions opposed to the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal has split over policy, Palestinian officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They told Reuters the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) led by George Habash and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) led by Nayhef Hawatmeh were refusing to participate in meetings.</p>
<p>Palestinians said the PFLP had been criticised for attending last year's Palestinian National Council meeting in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip. The DFLP was attacked for proposing talks with all Palestinian factions, including the Palestinian Authority headed by PLO chairman President Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>&quot;The DFLP and the PFLP are taking positions which contradict our policies which were adopted when we formed the alliance,&quot; a spokesman for the faction Fatah Uprising said. &quot;No dialogue should be made with Arafat and Israel because they are enemies of the Palestinian people.&quot;</p>
<p>The Damascus-based alliance, which includes the Islamic movement Hamas and Islamic Jihad, was established in 1993 to wreck the PLO's peace deal with Israel.</p>
<p>Other members are the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmed Jibril, the Palestinian Communist Party, Fatah Uprising led by Colonel Abu Musa who rebelled against Arafat in 1985, the Sa'qa group, the Palestine Liberation Front and the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front.</p>
<p>Members of the alliance have claimed responsibility for attacks in which scores of Israelis were killed or wounded since the Palestinian-Israeli peace deal.</p>
<p>&quot;No official decision was made yet on withdrawal from the alliance, but practically you could say that we are no longer taking part in meetings of the alliance. Our membership is frozen,&quot; a PFLP spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ali Badwan, spokesman of the DFLP, said alliance members had attacked his group's call for dialogue among all Palestinian groups, including Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not been taking part in meetings of the alliance for some time and we do not intend to take part in future meetings until the other members agree to take part in the dialogue among all Palestinian factions,&quot; he said.</p>
