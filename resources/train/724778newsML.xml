<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in a speech on Sunday that Islam is seen as the West's main enemy in the post-Soviet era, and he urged Western countries to stop viewing Islam negatively.</p>
<p>Egypt's Minister of Religious Endowments Mahmoud Hamdi Zakzouk delivered Mubarak's speech at a conference in Cairo on Islam and the West.</p>
<p>&quot;Some circles... since the collapse of the former Soviet union, regard Islam as the next threat and the substitute enemy for Western civilisation,&quot; Mubarak said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the complexity of today's interests requires finding a common ground for cooperation among all peoples.&quot;</p>
<p>Delegates and ministers from more than 75 countries are attending the four-day &quot;Islam and the West: Past, Present and Future&quot; conference, which aims to promote dialogue about relations between Islamic countries and the West.</p>
<p>Mubarak said any effort to find common ground &quot;...will be meaningless and will not continue unless the West stops viewing Islam negatively.&quot; He gave no specific examples.</p>
<p>In 1995, NATO secretary-general Willy Claes was quoted as saying Islamic fundamentalism posed as big a threat to the West as Communism once did.</p>
<p>In later interviews he moderated his tone, dropping the comparison with Communism but continuing to insist fundamentalism posed a major threat to the NATO alliance.</p>
<p>Islam is the official religion in Egypt, which sees itself as playing a pivotal role in Middle East peace brokering.</p>
<p>It hosts Islam's most prestigious seat of learning, the Cairo-based al-Azhar mosque. The head of Al-Azhar and Egypt's highest religious cleric, Sheikh Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi, told the conference that Moslems are required to fight those who fight Moslems and insult their prophet.</p>
<p>&quot;We must extend a hand of peace to those who are in peace with us. But our religion orders us to fight those who fight us and insult prophets and our prophet,&quot; Tantawi said.</p>
<p>He did not mention the incident in June in which Palestinians in the West Bank city of Hebron found posters on shops depicting Islam's Prophet Mohammad as a pig.</p>
<p>Tantawi was quoted earlier this month as saying that the person who drew the posters must be killed.</p>
<p>A Jewish woman has been arrested and charged.</p>
