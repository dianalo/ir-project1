<headline>Turkish security council meets amid coalition rift.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-03-31</dateline>

<p>Turkey's powerful National Security Council began a meeting on Monday in the shadow of a coalition rift caused by a military demand to keep Islam out of public life.</p>
<p>Generals and civilian leaders entered the meeting at President Suleyman Demirel's official residence carrying thick files and briefcases, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Demands by the military-dominated council last month for measures against religious activism have exposed cracks in Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist-led government.</p>
<p>A minister from the secular wing of the alliance was quoted on Monday as urging an end to the alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;This government cannot find a solution to the tension in the country. A new, broad-based government must be formed without wasting any time,&quot; the Hurriyet daily quoted Trade and Industry Minister Yalim Erez as saying.</p>
<p>Erez and fellow members of the True Path Party government ally have become increasingly critical of what they see as Erbakan's reticence to implement the army's demands.</p>
<p>The generals want restrictions imposed on religious education, enforcement of a ban on Islamic dress and an assault on pro-Islamist media and business as part of a planned return to Turkey's rigid secularism of the 1920s.</p>
<p>Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, has agreed to the demands in principle but his government has yet to expedite any of them.</p>
