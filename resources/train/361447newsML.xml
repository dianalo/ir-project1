<p>The staff of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr is completing a detailed memo outlining the pros and cons of bringing criminal charges against government officials, including President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and White House aides, the Washington Post reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Quoting sources close to the investigation, the newspaper said all the lawyers in the Little Rock and Washington offices of the independent counsel would review the memo that was based on evidence gathered over the past three years.</p>
<p>Revisions requested by Starr were expected to be completed in the next few weeks, the Post said.</p>
<p>The newspaper also reported that Starr's office said it had been provided with &quot;new and important information&quot; by James McDougal, a former partner of the Clintons in the failed Whitewater real estate deal.</p>
<p>McDougal was convicted of Whitewater-related fraud charges last year, along with his wife Susan, and the governor of Arkansas.</p>
<p>The independent counsel has taken sworn testimony from both Clintons and dozens of their associates and was evaluating whether to bring perjury and obstruction of justice charges, the Post said.</p>
<p>Starr's investigation is focusing on whether the Clintons or anyone else tried to conceal the true nature of the real estate dealings.</p>
