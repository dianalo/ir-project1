<headline>Dollar ends lower ahead of Rubin trip, jobs data.</headline>

<p>The dollar fell against the mark and the yen on Thursday after the release of strong German economic data and a report from the International Monetary Fund that said the yen had room to rise.</p>
<p>Nervousness preceding the release of key U.S. employment data and meetings between U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and top Japanese government officials on Friday also weighed on the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very afraid about whether Rubin will say more about trade in Japan and we're also cautious ahead of the non-farm payrolls number on Friday,&quot; said Bob Near, a vice president on the corporate foreign exchange desk at Bank of New York.</p>
<p>The currency market has been preoccupied for much of the week with U.S. warnings about Japan's hefty trade surplus with the United States, which is viewed by many as a direct result of the dollar's two-year rise against the yen.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Japanese Ministry of Finance officials tried to nip any incipient trade tensions in the bud, saying they did not expect the Japanese trade surplus to expand drastically.</p>
<p>But more harsh trade rhetoric from Secretary Rubin on Friday would suggest that the Clinton administration's tolerance for a strong dollar is limited.</p>
<p>The dollar ended the day at 122.59 yen, down from 123.24 yen Wednesday. Against the mark, the dollar drifted down to 1.6695 from 1.6755.</p>
<p>Strong German industrial output figures for February were behind the mark's strong performance Thursday.</p>
<p>German industrial production, driven by manufacturing strength and a seasonal rebound in construction, rose 1.9 percent in February over January and by 7.1 percent over February of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The sharp reversal of fortune for the dollar from Wednesday to Thursday is partially based on the good economic news out of Germany,&quot; said Bob Savage, chief dealer at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>The dollar's weakness against the yen emerged after release of an International Monetary Fund paper scheduled to be presented at a meeting of Asia-Pacific finance officials over the weekend.</p>
<p>The report said that the yen's depreciation since reaching post-World War II highs in early 1995 had corrected misalignments, but also noted that some of the yen's fall could be reversed.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF comments gave the market an excuse to sell the dollar against the yen,&quot; said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York.</p>
<p>Overall, however, Waxman said that trading was fairly subdued ahead of Friday's March jobs report, which is expected to clarify prospects for another interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>In other trade Thursday, the dollar pushed up to its highest level in two years against the Canadian dollar, before ending at C$1.3926 against C$1.3858 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The dollar settled at 1.4345 Swiss francs, down from 1.4420, while the British pound rose modestly to $1.6452 from $1.6440 on Wednesday.</p>
