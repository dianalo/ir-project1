<p>Japan sent strong signals to currency markets on Saturday that it was pleased with the yen's dramatic rise against the dollar this week and even hinted that more gains would not be excessive.</p>
<p>The clearest expression of delight came from the country's &quot;Mr Yen&quot;, senior finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara, who was asked by reporters if a nearly six-yen rise in the past week was an excessive gain.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it is not overly excessive,&quot; said Sakakibara, who is director-general of the ministry's International Finance Bureau.</p>
<p>Sakakibara, who earned his moniker for his influence over currency markets, was speaking in the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, where the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was due to be held.</p>
<p>Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, also in Fukuoka for the ADB meeting, said he believed the yen's rise indicated that foreign exchange markets were finally digesting a Group of Seven (G7) statement made last month on currency stability.</p>
<p>Financial leaders of the G7 -- Japan, the United States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- said in Washington last month that they would monitor exchange rates and cooperate as appropriate. They said currency values should reflect fundamentals and excess volatility was not desirable.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said that although the markets had not initially appeared to have caught on to the message from the world's richest nations, it now seemed to be sinking in.</p>
<p>Another finance ministry official also in Fukuoka echoed Mitsuzuka's views.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (the G7 statement) is getting through considerably,&quot; vice finance minister Takatoshi Kato said.</p>
<p>Traders said Saturday's remarks were likely to put the U.S. currency under further pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;These comments are likely to trigger further go-go dollar sales,&quot; one Japanese Big Four brokerage currency trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Tokyo players have been stuck with dollars at around 122 yen, but after such comments, Tokyo would probably start Monday trading at around the New York low of 119.05 yen.&quot;</p>
<p>Until this week, the dollar was supported by expectations of higher U.S. rates and continued low rates in Japan.</p>
<p>But a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday appearing to back away from a rise in short-term U.S. interest rates, and speculation of higher rates in Japan led traders to re-evaluate expectations and send the dollar lower.</p>
<p>On Friday, the drop accelerated, tumbling below the key 120 yen threshold in New York to its lowest point since January 27.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Sakakibara said it was possible, based on past movements, for the yen to strengthen to 103 yen against the dollar.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, speaking to U.S. business executives on Friday, declined to say if he shared Sakakibara's view, but said he shared Japanese concerns over the yen.</p>
<p>&quot;I would just say that we share (Japanese) concerns about recent movements in the context of the G7,&quot; Rubin said.</p>
<p>But Rubin also stood by his strong dollar stance.</p>
<p>Asked what he would tell U.S. company executives who told him the dollar was too strong, Rubin said: &quot;I'm going to tell them what I always tell them...I think our dollar policy has been right.&quot;</p>
<p>A strong dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive around the world, making it harder for U.S. exporters to compete against Japanese exporters whose goods become cheaper with a weaker yen.</p>
