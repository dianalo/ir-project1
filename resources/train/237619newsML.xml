<title>PAKISTAN: Cotton prices seen falling in India and Pakistan.</title>
<headline>Cotton prices seen falling in India and Pakistan.</headline>
<dateline>KARACHI, Pakistan 1996-12-05</dateline>

<p>Cotton prices are likely to fall in India and Pakistan next week amid rising supply and weak demand, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Karachi prices rose this week prompted by higher world prices and demand for quality stocks from spinners fearing a shortfall, but some dealers said rates had now peaked.</p>
<p>Dealer Kishin Chand said prices could slip next week despite concern among spinners that supplies of good quality cotton may dry up after December 15, with imports looking costly.</p>
<p>&quot;Spinners have already booked an estimated 125,000 480-lb bales, but most of the imported cotton will land in Pakistan after February,&quot; Chand said.</p>
<p>Dealers said high domestic prices had sidelined exporters while fresh arrivals would dampen demand from spinners.</p>
<p>Official rates were steady on Thursday. In the kerb market NIAB-78 traded at 2,225 rupees ($55.32) per maund (37.32 kg).</p>
<p>Weekly cotton spot rates in rupees per maund from the private Karachi Cotton Association were as follows -</p>
<p>					 Thursday    Wednesday   Nov 28</p>
<p>    NIAB-78 (1996/97 crop)     2,405	 2,405	 2,339</p>
<p>    K-68    (1996/97 crop)     2,597.50    2,597.50    2,504</p>
<p>    MNH-93  (1996/97 crop)     2,618.50    2,618.50    2,514</p>
<p>($1 = 40.22 rupees)</p>
<p>In India, increased new crop arrivals and limited buying by mills depressed prices this week, but dealers said expectations of a fresh export quota announcement could improve the mood.</p>
<p>&quot;Lately there have been rumours that the government has allowed an additional 100,000 bales of cotton export to the Cotton Corporation of India,&quot; said Manubhai Amersey, a leading dealer. &quot;We are awaiting confirmation from the government.&quot;</p>
<p>Daily crop arrivals in the Punjab region rose to 30-35,000 170-kg bales from 20-25,000 bales last week.</p>
<p>In spot deals, Bengal-deshi fell to 820-850 rupees per maund (37.32 kg) from 855-885 rupees. Punjab saw-ginned lost 40-60 rupees to 1,420-1,580. Gujarat Sankar-4 long-staple fell by 500 rupees to 17,500/18,500 rupees per candy (355.56 kg).</p>
<p>Leading exporter Chandubhai Thakkar predicted that the new cotton crop will reach only 15.4-15.6 million bales against an earlier estimate of 16.2-16.3 million bales.</p>
<p>&quot;There is room for a further decline in prices but I expect the market to bottom out by the end of the calendar year,&quot; he said. &quot;Market prices will start picking up again from January.&quot;</p>
<p>Amersey estimated the new crop at 15.70-15.80 million bales.</p>
<p>Traders said the government had allowed exports of 15,000 tonnes of cotton yarn last month and said they expected an additional export quota of about 10,000 tonnes this month.</p>
