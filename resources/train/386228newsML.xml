<p>Indonesian Armed Forces Commander General Feisal Tanjung said on Tuesday there were no security problems which could affect the exploitation of the gas-rich Natuna islands in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no security problems in the Natuna islands. Everything is under control there,&quot; Tanjung told a news conference.</p>
<p>Tanjung was commenting on questions about security problems on the Natuna islands, adjacent to the potentially oil-rich Spratly Islands which are claimed wholly or partly by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.</p>
<p>Indonesia in the past queried a Chinese maritime map that showed the waters around Natuna as part of Chinese territory. Jakarta has said it accepted a Chinese explanation which acknowledged the Natuna islands belonged to Indonesia.</p>
<p>Tanjung said the gas exploration project in Natuna would not face any security problems. &quot;The armed forces have guaranteed that. There won't be any problems,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Indonesia's military held a 12-day exercise on and around the Natunas last September, involving 19,525 personnel from all branches of the armed forces, 54 aircraft and 27 warships.</p>
<p>Tanjung denied at that time the exercise was a show of force designed to warn off China.</p>
<p>State Minister of Research and Technology Jusuf Habibie, who is also chairman of the Natuna project team, on Tuesday said 13 Japanese companies have shown an interest in buying a stake in the project from state-owned oil firm Pertamina.</p>
<p>Pertamina, which holds a 24 percent stake in Natuna, plans to reduce its share to 11 percent by selling 13 percent of the total stake.</p>
<p>U.S. oil giant Exxon Corp holds 50 percent of the project and Mobil Corp has 26 percent.</p>
<p>The Natuna gas field, some 689 miles (1,100 km) north of Jakarta off the northwest coast of West Kalimantan province, is estimated to contain 210 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas, of which 45 Tcf are thought to be commercially recoverable.</p>
