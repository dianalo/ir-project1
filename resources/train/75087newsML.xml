<p>Romania's average monthly inflation over the first eight months of 1996 quickened to 3.0 percent, double the year-ago rate, National Statistics Board (CNS) data showed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Data showed monthly inflation in the food sector, which takes the bulk of consumer spending, was 2.7 percent in January-August, up from 1.3 percent last year.</p>
<p>Non-food sector inflation was 3.3 percent, up from 1.5 percent, and services sector inflation 3.5 percent, up from 2.4.</p>
<p>The CNS said price rises in the non-food sector were higher than because of rises in the price of clothing, footwear, furniture and refrigerators and freezers.</p>
<p>The marked rise in average monthly inflation in the services sector was a result of higher train fares and tariffs for community services, including water supply, sewerage and sanitation services, and public transport.</p>
<p>Monthly inflation was 3.8 percent in August, when year-on-year inflation was 44.2 percent.</p>
<p>The CNS said August inflation was above the monthly January-August average because of the delayed impact of energy and fuel price rises in July.</p>
<p>Under pressure from World Bank to bring energy prices closer to international norms, Romania jacked up electricity and thermal power prices by 58 percent and fuel by some 30 percent early in July.</p>
<p>The rises pushed July inflation to 7.5 percent -- the biggest monthly increase in two years -- and, according to official estimates, are expected to hoist 12-month inflation this year to around 30 percent from a previously forecast 20 percent. -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
