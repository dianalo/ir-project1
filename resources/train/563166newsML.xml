<p>Recurrent cold sores and painful mouth lesions caused by a form of herpes that afflicts one in three Americans healed more quickly when a recently approved cream was applied, a study released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>The 782 people given penciclovir antiviral cream reported a median healing time of 4.8 days for their cold sores, compared to 5.5 days for those applying a placebo.</p>
<p>The length of time pain was experienced from the sores, which can appear several times a year on the lips and nostrils, was shortened to 3.5 days with the cream compared to 4.1 days for the placebo.</p>
<p>The trial, which was funded in part by drug maker SmithKline Beecham Plc, required frequent application and may have underestimated its benefits, study author Spotwood Spruance from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>The cream, available by prescription under the brand name Denavir, was recently granted U.S. approval based on the findings of U.S., Canadian and European trials.</p>
<p>Cold sores affect between 20 percent and 45 percent of Americans and can be triggered by the sun, fever, stress, menstruation and the common cold. The cause, herpes simplex virus type-1, can be spread by the lesions through direct contact or shared surfaces such as drinking from the same cup.</p>
<p>The cream contains the same active agent as the oral pill Famvir that is used to treat recurrent genital herpes, which is caused by herpes simplex type-2, and herpes zoster, or shingles. The drug works by inhibiting viral DNA replication in herpes-infected cells.</p>
