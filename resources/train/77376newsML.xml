<headline>FOCUS-Dollar boosted by rates, bourses mixed.</headline>

<p>The dollar rose strongly in European trade on Thursday as the markets reassessed this week's decision to hold U.S. interest rates unchanged and the Swiss made a surprise cut in their own rates.</p>
<p>The dollar powered a pfennig higher through 1.52 marks as the German currency came under pressure from a series of European units.</p>
<p>In the equity markets, European bourses spent a mixed morning. London went into retreat after a firm start, Frankfurt rose modestly and Paris fluctuated around its opening levels after being weighed down by disappointing results from some market heavyweights.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange markets were surprised by the Swiss National Bank's decision to hack 0.50 of a percentage point off its discount rate, taking it to 1.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The Swiss are worried about the impact of a fudged EMU on the Swiss franc,&quot; said Ian Amstad of Bankers Trust in London in reference to the debate over European economic and monetary union. &quot;They're trying to pre-empt any upward pressure on the franc by cutting rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts were surprised at the timing of the easing, which took the discount rate to its lowest level since it was cut to 1.0 in 1978, although they said persistent weak Swiss economic data and an absence of inflationary pressure were clear justifications.</p>
<p>The Italian lira, which hit two-year peaks against the mark on Wednesday, led the way up for high-yielding currencies but traders said they had detected the Bank of Italy intervening to slow the rise.</p>
<p>Despite accepting the Fed's decision this week to keep monetary policy steady, analysts said the market would scrutinise U.S. August durable goods data due at 1230 GMT to assess whether the move was correct. U.S. weekly jobless claims were also due at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;The danger is that if the durable goods are considerably stronger than the market is going for...that would be a signal the Fed had taken too many risks and perhaps the lack of action was politically rather than economically inspired,&quot; said Stephen King, deputy chief economist at HSBC James Capel in London.</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index started the day firm but shares turned down during the morning in thin trade ahead of Wall Street's start. By 1115 GMT, the FTSE was down 4.4 points, having gained 25.2 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;People are just sort of sitting back. Where there's news people are interested. It's all very stock specific,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Topping the most active list were shares in AEA. The shares, making their debut, surged to a sharp premium, jumping to a high of 332p, well ahead of the 280p flotation price. They were last quoted at 324p.</p>
<p>France's blue chip CAC-40 index weakened a few points in early trading as some stocks took a hammering from investors after reporting disappointing first-half results. LVMH fell 26 francs to 1,075, while Lyonnaise des Eaux fell 9.1 to 457.90.</p>
<p>German DAX slipped from its highs by the end of the morning, with dealers saying orders remained thin amid fears of a market correction.</p>
<p>Little major movement was expected during the bourse session, but dealers said the post-bourse session could be affected by the U.S. data.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1115 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.5211 marks and 110.54 yen, up from late Wednesday's European level of 1.5112 marks and 110.40 yen.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1115</p>
<p>LONDON - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 4.4 points at 3,931.3.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 share index was up 0.62 points at 2,104.03.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index was up 9.06 points at 2.668.03. PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $382.05 vs $382.40 previously. Silver was two cents lower $4.90.</p>
