<headline>S.African stock market closing report.</headline>

<text>
<p>South African industrial stocks perked up towards the close of Thursday's session, pushed up by what dealers said was firm two-way trade after drifting weaker for most of the day on a softer gold price.</p>
<p>Dealers said a slight weakening in bullion price had also dulled the gold board, weighing down the all-share index which ended 5.1 points off its overnight record peak at 7,102.6.</p>
<p>&quot;The weakness came from the gold price which softened during the day and heavyweights on the gold board came under pressure. They were all down and this weighed on the all-share index,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $344.85 per ounce down from $346.25 on Wednesday in London.</p>
<p>The Johannesburg Stock Exchange's gold index shed 10.7 points to end at 1,470.9 while industrials recouped earlier losses, rising 22.5 points to 8,391.7.  </p>
<p>Dealers said turnover on the JSE was high at 788 million rand on the day.</p>
<p>SAB shed one rand to 139 rand, Vaal Reefs dropped 1.25 rand to 338.75 rand and Anglos lost 50 cents to 274.50 rand.</p>
<p>South African share futures regained earlier losses and finished strong on firm underlying sentiment.</p>
<p>The all-share March contract was last at 6,530/45, the industrial contract was at 8,200/08 from 8,162 and the golds contract was at 1,030/36 from 1,043.</p>
