<p>Tiny oil-rich sultanate Brunei is seeking to attract French businesses and promote its unspoilt rainforest as a key destination for &quot;eco-tourism,&quot; Brunei's minister for industry and primary resources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Brunei was making &quot;determined efforts to encourage diversification within the economy. The oil and gas will not last forever,&quot; Pehin Haji Abdul Rahman Taib told reporters. He was accompanying the Sultan of Brunei on his first state visit to France.</p>
<p>The Sultan earlier met French President Jacques Chirac and discussed ways of expanding bilateral economic cooperation, particularly in trade and investment, the minister said.</p>
<p>Brunei is seeking to attract direct foreign investment in high technology, food processing and tourism, he said.</p>
<p>The tourism drive, however, will be selective, in keeping with Brunei's conservation policy of its rainforests. It was &quot;only one of the few countries to preserve the (rainforest) habitat,&quot; unlike others which exploited it for timber, he said.</p>
<p>Brunei wanted to tap some of the flow of tourists from countries in the Asia/Pacific region such as Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, who currently go to nearby destinations such as Malaysia.</p>
<p>&quot;Why don't we take some of them?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>The Brunei delegation was also meeting heads of French companies in a bid to attract foreign firms. It wants to draw small and medium-sized companies, not only to invest directly, but to tap the highly-educated local population.</p>
<p>But as Brunei's domestic population represents a tiny market of 280,000, it is marketing itself as a launchpad for the Asia/Pacific region.</p>
<p>&quot;Our ambition is to develop Brunei as a gateway to the world's most dynamic economic region. ASEAN has a population of 420 million, with GNP of more than $600 billion and annual economic growth of eight percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It has set up the China Infrastructure Development Fund, in which two large French firms, aluminium group Pechiney SA and cement maker Lafarge SA are involved.</p>
<p>Brunei, which is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) defence grouping and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, could act as a matchmaker between French and Asian companies.</p>
<p>The existance of such regional groupings should defuse conflicts in the area, Abdul Rahman Taib said and the present trend in heavy military spending reflected affluence and a replacement need, not than hostile intentions.</p>
