<headline>Danish bonds up, yield gap less in pre-holiday lull.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish bond prices rose slightly, the 10-year yield gap with Germany narrowed marginally and dealers expected little to happen on Wednesday in a quiet market prior to Thursday's Ascension Day holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing much to report today. It is going to be calm up to the close with Wall Street's opening possibly sparking a little activity. Tomorrow's holiday in much of Europe is putting a damper on trade,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The benchmark eight percent state bond due 2006 was up 0.09 point from the opening at 110.44, yielding 6.41 percent in turnover of only 720 million crowns.  </p>
<p>The 2006 benchmark's June future rose 0.17 point to 110.05 with 130 contracts traded. The six percent mortgage bond due 2026 gained 0.33 point to 88.55.</p>
<p>The crown traded at 3.8078 per mark at 1130 gmt, up a smidgen from around 3.8085 at the opening.</p>
<p>The 10-year yield gap with Germany narrowed one basis point to 65.</p>
<p>The Central Bank was active on the market selling a total of 355 million crowns worth of five percent 2005 and seven percent 2007 and 2024 bonds as part of its routine financing operations.</p>
