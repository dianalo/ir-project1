<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sold in thin trade Monday at $65.00 per cwt, down $1.00 from late sales last week, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 1,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area and about 200 in Kansas.</p>
<p>The volume was said to be too light for a market test, with most owners still asking $66.00 to $68.00, sources said.</p>
<p>Feedlot operators continued to brace for extreme cold which was expected to blanket much of the Plains and Midwest by Wednesday. Temperatures in the Panhandle area could dip below zero degrees Fahrenheit, meteorologists said.  </p>
<p>Strong winds with the cold could send wind chills plummeting, further stressing cattle and slowing weight gains, several sources noted.</p>
<p>However, little to no snow was expected in the Panhandle area or Kansas, which could lessen the cold's impact on the cattle, they said.</p>
<p>The showlist in the Panhandle was estimated at 56,000 head, down about 7,500 from last week and the Kansas showlist was pegged near 75,000, down 4,000.</p>
