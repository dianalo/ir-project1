<p>The leader of Albania's ruling Democratic Party, Tristan Sehu, said on Wednesday a parliamentary election would take place as scheduled this month despite problems in the pre-election campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Elections will go ahead as scheduled on June 29 at all costs,&quot; Sehu told reporters after a meeting with Greece's opposition conservative party leader, Costas Karamanlis.</p>
<p>But Sehu conceded that there were difficulties in the run-up to the election, called in a bid to end months of rebellion and banditry triggered by the collapse of fraudulent pyramid savings schemes.</p>
<p>Sehu, who also met Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, said election campaigns could not be conducted in some areas because &quot;they have been taken over by extremists&quot;.</p>
<p>His comments came after the head of a European group monitoring the operation of Albania's election resigned for personal reasons, amid mounting concern for the security and organisation of the poll.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said on Tuesday that Briton Brian Pridham, overall coordinator for the democratic and human rights arm of the OSCE in Albania, had returned to England.</p>
<p>OSCE spokesman Jeff Murray told Reuters that Pridham, who had been in Albania for just under a month organising foreign observers for the poll, would be replaced by another Briton, Tony Welch.</p>
<p>Murray denied that Pridham had quit over concerns about the handling of the operation.</p>
