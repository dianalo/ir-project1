<headline>Turkey's Erbakan attacks &quot;secular fascists&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-03-11</dateline>

<p>Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan slammed his opponents on Tuesday as secular &quot;fascists&quot; and presented himself as the guardian of democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;The fascist secularists are confined to history now. Fascist secularism is being replaced by civilised secularism and Western secularism in Turkey,&quot; Erbakan told a meeting of his Welfare Party in Ankara.</p>
<p>The military-dominated National Security Council (MGK) issued a warning to Erbakan at the end of February, ordering him to clamp down on Islamist activity that the generals say is a threat to the country's official secular constitution.</p>
<p>The military objected to measures planned by Erbakan's government to relax laws on Islamic headgear in public work-places and build mosques in traditionally secular strongholds.</p>
<p>But Erbakan, who only reluctantly signed the MGK declaration, said the military's demands infringe religious freedom and human rights.</p>
<p>&quot;To pose secularism against religion is ignorance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The cabinet is now due to discuss the military's demands, inlcuding enforcing the bans on Islamist dress, at a weekly meeting on Thursday. Coalition partner Tansu Ciller has proposed a parliamentary debate into the measures.</p>
<p>In a series of meetings last week Erbakan failed to get the backing of other political party leaders -- even that of Ciller's conservative party -- in his bid to forge a front against the MGK's pressure in the name of democratic freedom.</p>
<p>&quot;The artificial agenda of the last few days, the secular-anti-secular debate and the meetings we had with the poitical leaders showed who was on the side of democracy,&quot; Erbakan said.</p>
<p>Erbakan became modern Turkey's first Islamist leader last June in a coalition agreement with pro-Western Foreign Minister Ciller's DYP.</p>
