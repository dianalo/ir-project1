<p>Chilean police inspected a secretive German settlement in the south of Chile for the second successive day on Wednesday in search of its fugitive leader, Paul Schaeffer.</p>
<p>Some 20 policemen arrived in four vehicles at Colonia Dignidad (Dignity Colony) to continue inspections they started on Tuesday, with the stated goal of looking for Schaeffer, an officer in the Nazi army in the second World War accused of sexually assaulting boys.</p>
<p>But members of the colony have said Schaeffer has not been seen in the community for months. One elderly member said he doubted Schaeffer would surrender to police as some of his confidants have.</p>
<p>Schaeffer, believed to be about 80, has had an arrest-warrant against him since November 1996 on charges of child abuse, obstruction of justice and other charges.</p>
<p>The latest search of the German compound, near Parral some 200 miles (320 kilometres) south of Santiago, surprised the settlers on Wednesday, a holiday in Chile. For the second day, church bells rang as a signal of alarm.</p>
<p>Police Major Enrique Ramirez told reporters his mission was to continue inspections started the day before under orders from prosecuting judge Hernan Gonzalez, appointed to investigate charges of child abuse made by children who attended a boarding school at the colony.</p>
<p>The sprawling, tightly controlled community, which includes a hospital and farms, officially changed its name to Villa Baviera (Bavarian Village) in 1991 when the Chilean government cancelled its status as a charitable organisation. It is still usually known as Colonia Dignidad, even by its few hundred residents.</p>
<p>&quot;Our mission is to arrest Mr. Schaeffer,&quot; the head of Chile's national Carabinero police, Fernando Cordero, told reporters in the port of Valparaiso, where he was attending festivities for the Naval Glories Day.</p>
<p>Critics of the police attacked the inspections and demanded explantions as to why authorities stormed the place, located at the foot of the snow-capped Andes near the town of Parral, a town best-known as the birthplace of poet Pablo Neruda.</p>
<p>Schaeffer, who appears in the few recent photographs of him as a stout, balding man, issued a blistering statement from hiding last week saying he feared for his life and would not get a fair trial in Chile if he surrendered. His lawyers quit after the statement, saying they had tried to persuade him to give up.</p>
<p>Two confidants, both German citizens, and two Chilean members of the settlement surrendered to police last week to face charges including the illegal detention of a child, obstruction of justice and the destruction of public property. All four were later released on bail.</p>
<p>Schaeffer founded the colony in about 1960, according to Chilean news reports. It was protected by the former military regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and human rights groups have charged that the military used it as a secret detention and torture centre.</p>
<p>Charges of child molestation have dogged the colony since at least 1966. The accusations came to a head in 1996, when the parents of five boys attending the boarding school filed charges of sexual assault against the colony's authorities.</p>
