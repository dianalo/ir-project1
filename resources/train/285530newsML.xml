<p>Large stocks climbed steadily in 1996, but small stocks rallied in a late-year surge, Frank Russell Co said.</p>
<p>Large capitalization stocks tracked by the Russell 1000 index returned 22.5 percent in 1996 compared to 16.5 percent for the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncertainty over the direction of the economy led investors to favor largest stocks with more visible earnings growth,&quot; said Paul Greenwood, senior research analyst for Frank Russell.  </p>
<p>Energy services and exploration and production companies led both large and small cap sectors. Stocks in technology, financial services and consumer staples were also leaders in the large cap market.</p>
<p>The weakest sectors included utilities and small-cap health care stocks, the firm said.</p>
<p>Large cap stocks lost ground at the end of the year. The Russell 1000 returned lost 1.6 percent in December and the Russell 1000 Growth Index post 2.0 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Small value stocks surged to lead the overall market, with a monthly return of more than 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>Russell indices serve as performance standards against which money managers and mutual funds can be evaluated. More than $93.5 billion is invested in index funds that use Russell indices as their model.</p>
