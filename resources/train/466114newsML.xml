<p>United Engineers Ltd said on Tuesday it expects its 1997 net profit to remain the same as that of 1996.</p>
<p>The group said in a statement accompanying its full year results that income from rental properties would depend in large part to the condition of Singapore's economy.</p>
<p>Fueled by increasing overseas business, its engineering and construction as well as its health care services division were expected to grow, it said.  </p>
<p>The statement also said the group's manufacturing and equipment supply and its information technology divisions were expected to reduce operating losses and improve their performance after restructuring business activities.</p>
<p>The company said its 1996 net profit rose 54 percent to Singapore $15.05 million from S$9.79 million.</p>
