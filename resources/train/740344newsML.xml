<p>Six red combine harvesters stand idle at the corner of a huge wheat field in Russia's fertile Krasnodar region by the Black Sea, their drivers sheltering from the rain in a rickety old trailer.</p>
<p>For the third day running, the skies have opened over Russia's grain belt just when the farmers least want it -- harvest time.</p>
<p>&quot;Our machines just can't work the fields when it's wet like this,&quot; said Ivan Revko, deputy director at the Agrokompleks farm, one of Krasnodar's biggest and most successful. &quot;All that hard work, and then it starts to rain.&quot;</p>
<p>Production in Krasnodar is watched keenly by Russia's agriculture sector -- it is the first major grain region to gather crops and accounts for a big slice of national output, especially the top end of the quality range.</p>
<p>The harvest of the key winter wheat crop is already well under way in Russia's southern grain regions, and early returns suggest a marked improvement in quality and quantity compared to last year's disastrous record.</p>
<p>Russian &quot;Don&quot; combines have been working the golden fields for two weeks, and under clear skies the job could be finished in five to six days. But weather is a factor right to the bitter end in this region.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already had a lot of rain this season and are seeing the quality of wheat suffer,&quot; said Leonid Gorkovyenko, first deputy head of production at the administrative headquarters in Krasnodar, the regional centre.</p>
<p>FARM WORKERS FRUSTRATED BUT PHILOSOPHICAL</p>
<p>For those working the fields, the rains are a hassle but not the end of the world.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not ideal to be sitting here, waiting, but at least we don't have to worry about job security,&quot; said Alexander, one of the combine drivers waiting for the rain to subside. &quot;As long as we get enough money to feed ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>The easy banter and gold-toothed grins on the drivers' weather-beaten faces may be explained by the fact that harvest time is the most lucrative of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;On a really good day, our drivers can make up to $100,&quot; Revko said.</p>
<p>But that would mean working from dawn until dusk, and the rains have not allowed that very often this year.</p>
<p>After the wheat has been safely stored, Krasnodar's farmers set to work on sunflowers and sugar beet -- two other important crops in this &quot;Black Earth&quot; region, named after its rich, dark soil.</p>
<p>Wheat output in areas across Krasnodar looks set to rise from last year's poor return, much to the relief of officials in places where half the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood.</p>
<p>In the area around the town of Vysyelki, 100 km (60 miles) northeast of Kransnodar and home to the Agrokompleks farm, administration head Boris Rastorguyev is looking for a grain crop a third higher than last year's.</p>
<p>&quot;We will definitely produce between 220,000 and 230,000 tonnes of grain this year from 171,000 tonnes in 1996,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Quality is even more important to him.</p>
<p>&quot;This year, up to 80 percent of our output will be high quality grain, good for food,&quot; Rastorguyev said. &quot;Last year it was something like 10 percent -- a disaster.&quot;</p>
<p>He said efforts by the regional administration to secure fertilisers, pesticides and insecticides to treat the crops were the key to the improvement.</p>
<p>&quot;Only thanks to this are we working on nearly 100 percent of the land available,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Vysyelki's 14 farms, now joint stock corporations since Moscow washed its hands of the ailing farm sector after 1991, still rely heavily on local and regional support to survive, underlining the deep crisis faced by the sector across the country.</p>
<p>Moscow used to support old-style Soviet collective farms, offering cheap credits and securing fuel and other supplies as part of its drive for grain self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The system was an expensive, hit-and-miss affair. Crops have fluctuated wildly in the last three decades between 127.4 million tonnes in 1978 to 63.4 million in 1995.</p>
<p>To fill the gaps left by failed harvests, Russia raided the world's bread bins in bulk buying known as the great grain robbery which sent world futures exchanges into a frenzy.</p>
<p>But with only one republic to support since 1991, and not 15 as in the past, Moscow's buying sprees have calmed down.</p>
<p>Russia is still a small net grain importer, although it still relies on overseas products ranging from frozen chicken portions to baby food to meet around 40 percent of its food needs.</p>
<p>KUBAN REGION MAY LEAD WAY TO BIGGER RUSSIAN HARVEST</p>
<p>Expectations in Vysyelki reflect in microcosm what the Krasnodar region is forecasting for the grain sector.</p>
<p>&quot;At this early stage, I think it is reasonable to expect a harvest here of one million tonnes more than in 1996,&quot; Gorkovyenko said.</p>
<p>Grain output in this farm belt, which lies at the foothills of the Caucasus mountains, was a paltry 4.52 million tonnes in 1996 from 5.73 million in 1995 and 9.77 million in 1990.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Ministry has set a target for Russian grain output of 70 million net tonnes, little changed from 1996's second worst showing in 30 years of 69.3 million tonnes. Some analysts see a rise to 75-80 million tonnes.</p>
<p>But Russia's harvest is no longer the idealised nationwide effort extolled by communists for nearly 70 years.</p>
<p>In the reception room at Agrokompleks headquarters, what happens in other regions is of little importance. In Krasnodar at least, things could be a lot worse.</p>
<p>&quot;To the harvest,&quot; Rastorguyev said, raising a glass of vodka with a smile.</p>
