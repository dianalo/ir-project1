<p>Global warming could be contributing to killing off krill, the favourite food of whales, penguins and other sea animals, scientists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The tiny, shrimp-like creatures are being undermined  by salps, according to Valerie Loeb of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in Moss Landing, California and colleagues.</p>
<p>Salps are tunicates -- simple, pouch-like sea creatures that are not eaten by many animals but which create dense blooms that interfere with krill reproduction and kill off their larvae.</p>
<p>&quot;Our data suggest that decreased krill availability may affect the levels of their vertebrate predators. Regional warming and reduced krill abundance, therefore, affect the marine food web,&quot; they wrote in a report in the science journal Nature.</p>
<p>They noticed the salps flourished in years when there was less sea ice, while the krill, the primary food of many sea-going animals, did better in colder years.</p>
<p>The salps also seemed to eat up the krill's food in warmer years, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;A warming trend has been documented for the Antarctic Peninsula region since the 1940s, and a decreased frequency of extensive winter sea-ice conditions has been associated with this trend,&quot; they wrote.</p>
<p>The krill population had already become noticeably smaller and predators could already be suffering, they said. Adelie penguins on King George Island had already suffered a 30 percent population decline.</p>
