<p>United States military helicopters resumed their evacuation of American citizens from the Albanian capital Tirana on Saturday, a U.S. military spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman told Reuters that the operation, which had been suspended on Friday after two Marine Cobra helicopters came under ground fire, restarted at dawn on Saturday and 89 people had been brought out.</p>
<p>Tirana was quieter on Saturday morning, with the level of gunfire greatly reduced. Authorities facing a nationwide slide into anarchy have sought to restore order by parading armoured vehicles on the streets and raising police pay.</p>
<p>The United States has so far evacuated about 500 people from Tirana, which in recent days has been the scene of growing lawlessness with people looting rifles from arms depots and loosing off bursts of gunfire into the air.</p>
<p>The U.S. spokesman said it was hoped to bring out 200 people from Tirana on Saturday. &quot;Everything seems to have gone smoothly,&quot; he said of the latest phase of the operation.</p>
<p>On Friday, two U.S. helicopters were fired on from the ground, while an Italian helicopter was also hit. German troops mounting a helicopter rescue exchanged fire with gunmen on the ground, wounding one Albanian.</p>
<p>European efforts to end the lawlessness exposed deep divisions. Top negotiator Franz Vranitzky said outside military intervention was vital, but German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Bonn had no intention of deploying peacekeeping troops and was &quot;extremely sceptical&quot; about such a plan.</p>
<p>Albanian President Sali Berisha appeared on television on Friday with his new prime minister, Bashkim Fino, and members of an all-party cabinet he approved this week after long resistance to the idea.</p>
<p>He said Albanians had to expend their own efforts in addition to the military aid it requested from NATO's European members -- the Western European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the request to the Western European Union (WEU) to help with military force for a political solution...we should make every effort to come out of this crisis,&quot; the television quoted Berisha as saying. &quot;I will hold talks with the parties to set up reconciliation committees in all the districts.&quot;</p>
<p>Authorities made high-profile attempts to calm residents after mass looting confined to the south spread to Tirana and most other parts of the country over a 48-hour period.</p>
<p>Police armoured vehicles rumbled down cobbled, tree-lined boulevards in mid-afternoon, their hatches occupied by men pointing automatic weapons skyward. A convoy of vans followed.</p>
<p>A curfew introduced as part of emergency rule two weeks ago was brought forward by one hour to 7 p.m. By nightfall, tension and shooting had subsided from 24 hours earlier.</p>
<p>Fino announced that the head of the sinister secret police, Bashkim Gazidede, had resigned and the force would be controlled by the government and not the president.</p>
<p>Gazidede's departure was a key demand of rebels who seized most of southern Albania at the outbreak of unrest initially sparked by the collapse of popular but shady investment funds.</p>
<p>Fino said he had discussed with Vranitzky, former Austrian leader, the possible creation of an international force to help restore order in the country.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, who also saw rebel leaders aboard an Italian frigate in the Adriatic, told reporters back in Vienna that outside help was needed quickly.</p>
<p>European Union foreign ministers will examine the Albanian crisis at a weekend meeting in the Netherlands, but diplomats expected little to come of it. An emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors this week showed limited enthusiasm for military intervention.</p>
