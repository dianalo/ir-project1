<title>BRAZIL: Brazil's Cardoso urges Congress to act on reforms.</title>
<headline>Brazil's Cardoso urges Congress to act on reforms.</headline>
<dateline>BRASILIA 1997-01-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso Thursday urged Congress to push on with approving key fiscal reforms but acknowledged that the upper and lower houses had a right to determine their own timetables.</p>
<p>&quot;Brazil can't wait any longer for these reforms.  Let's get them done,&quot; Cardoso told reporters, referring to reforms of the pension system, civil service and tax law which have been bogged down in Congress for months.  </p>
<p>Cardoso, who on Tuesday won a key first vote in the lower house on his bid to be allowed to run for a second term, acknowledged that elections next week for the Chamber of Deputies and Senate presidencies would dominate attentions.</p>
<p>&quot;Congress' timetable is its own concern,&quot; he said.  &quot;We have the elections next week.  We must respect the dynamics of Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>Cardoso said he hoped the Senate would rapidly press on with reconstructing a pension reform bill that was rendered useless by the lower house and the Chamber of Deputies would get on with voting on changes to the civil service.  </p>
<p>Both reforms are regarded as essential if Brazil is to balance its books.  The public sector ran an estimated consolidated operational deficit of about 4.5 percent of gross domestic product in 1996 after 5.0 percent in 1995.</p>
