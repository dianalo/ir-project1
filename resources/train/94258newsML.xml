<p>European Union leaders, divided even over the need to meet each other, will gather in Dublin on Saturday to try to prepare the wealthy bloc for an influx of poor countries from the east and Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The leaders are expected to urge inter-governmental conference (IGC) negotiators, who are drafting a new treaty to make the Union more efficient, to finish their task on schedule next June amidst fears that their discussions have come unstuck.</p>
<p>&quot;The Union must equip itself for the global challenges of the 21st century,&quot; Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, the summit host, wrote in a letter inviting his colleagues to Dublin.</p>
<p>He said the leaders should prepare themselves to give political guidance and impetus to the talks.</p>
<p>The IGC, which was launched in March, is designed to reform the EU's institutions and procedures so that the Union can absorb a dozen or more new members from Estonia in the north through eastern Europe to tiny Malta in the south.</p>
<p>That much is agreed. But the leaders who meet each other for the one-day informal gathering in Ireland's capital on Saturday have numerous differences, not least over how well the IGC talks are going.</p>
<p>France and the European Commission, in particular, have been complaining that the negotiations are bogged down, threatening, according to Commission President Jacques Santer, the future plans for enlargement.</p>
<p>Others, including host Bruton, believe the talks are pretty much where they should be six months into what is likely to be a 15-month exercise.</p>
<p>It was pressure from French President Jacques Chirac, backed by Germany, that led to Saturday's summit -- which many were reluctant to have, fearing it would raise expectations.</p>
<p>Britain, more openly than others, has said it believes the summit to be unnecessary.</p>
<p>Behind the differences lie a series of splits among member states about what direction the IGC, indeed the EU itself, should be taking. While many see it as a chance for a new move towards political integration, others remain wary.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister John Major's Conservative government is the most vehemently opposed to any further loss of national sovereignty. With his party conference only a few days away, Major will seek to avoid appearing too conciliatory.</p>
<p>London has been blamed for much of the slow pace of the IGC talks, but officials close to the negotiations say few countries are prepared to take the steps widely accepted as necessary or desirable if the EU is to expand.</p>
<p>These include taking more decisions by Qualified Majority Voting (QMV), cutting the number of European commissioners, &quot;communitarising&quot; policies in areas such as foreign policy and Third Pillar judicial affairs, and developing an EU-wide defence policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Communitarising&quot; would bring policies that are now dealt with on on inter-governmental basis under the traditional European Community decision-making procedures.</p>
<p>Part of the reluctance is put down to the nothing-is-agreed-until-everything-is-agreed syndrome, the natural desire of countries not to show their hand until the last moment.</p>
<p>But officials close to the negotiations say there is also a reluctance to accept what many say is the minimum that must be done to make the EU efficient.</p>
<p>Small countries, for example, will not countenance losing a commissioner or seeing their right to hold the EU presidency diminished.</p>
<p>Nearly every country except Britain says that more QMV will be needed in an enlarged Union. But while Britain is the only country to rule out any further move to QMV, other countries refuse such a move in almost every specific instance.</p>
<p>France and Germany, the traditional engines of European integration, say they are narrowing their difference on what direction the IGC should take, but they have so far failed to come up with an initiative to break the logjam.</p>
<p>At a meeting on Paris on Wednesday, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the two countries had agreed that Third Pillar issues would be &quot;communitarised&quot;, but French ministers quickly said national parliaments had to be given a voice and that the Council of Ministers would have to initiate any Third Pillar action.</p>
<p>A Franco-German initiative is expected to come before the European Council in Dublin in December, officials say.</p>
<p>The two have been calling for a special &quot;flexibility&quot; clause to be added to the EU treaty to allow some countries to integrate faster than others if they wish.</p>
<p>Many EU countries like the idea of flexibility, but they fear letting it go too far and creating a bloc of first-, second- and even third-class countries.</p>
<p>There is widespread opposition to a broad flexibility clause, leading many to suggest that the concept will have to be introduced on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The disagreements have recently triggered some discussions among officials about the likelihood of having the IGC stretch into the Luxembourg presidency in the second half of next year.</p>
<p>Some argue this will be necessary anyway in order to allow a new British government -- widely expected to be Labour -- to accept the treaty.</p>
<p>The British election will have to be held by May next year. If it is held at the last moment, a new government would have only about six weeks to agree a treaty.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, meanwhile, has indicated that European integration is a slow process and that not everything has to be done now.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not catastrophic if we can't come up with all the answers now,&quot; he said in Dublin on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;While there are questions that have to be asked, we don't have to answer them immediately. Let us first introduce the (euro), let us do the simple basic things that are necessary to lay the groundwork for Europe and then let us tackle the problems,&quot; he said.</p>
