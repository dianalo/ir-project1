<p>Morocco's Treasury has cut by half a point to between 8.5 percent and 9.5 percent interest rates on short and medium term Treasury bills, a central bank official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision of discounting Treasury bills by half a point to between 8.5 and 9.5 percent was effective from March 19, 1997,&quot; the official at Bank al-Maghrib (central bank) said.</p>
<p>It raised 676.50 million dirhams ($72 million) from its weekly treasury bill auction on Wednesday, the bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;The treasury cut its interest rates because the inflation rate was too low...Since the end of 1996 the money market was heading towards a declining trend,&quot; a Casablanca-based banker said.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Ministry, Morocco's inflation dropped to 3.0 percent in 1996 from 6.1 percent in the previous year.  </p>
<p>The decision coincided with the finance ministry announcement on Monday of a discounted public T-bond issue on the Casablanca stock exchange at between 8.5 and 9.5 percent interest rate.</p>
<p>Subscription will be closed on March 28, 1997, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Treasury bonds called &quot;Emprunt National&quot; are listed on the stock exchange as part of the state domestic debt oriented to small investors and will be negotiable on the market from March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Eligible auction participants including banks and insurance firms may find these rates less attractive...And allocate more funds to the stock market which provides higher return yields,&quot; Sofia Echihabi, a market analyst at Upline Securities stockbroker said.</p>
<p>It also took place with Morocco's commercial banks decision to cut interest rates by two points on medium and long term investment loans to small and medium-sized firms, a banker said.</p>
<p>King Hassan urged banks and the finance ministry, in his throne speech on March 3, to cut interest rates on loans particularly to small and medium-sized firms.</p>
<p>Total domestic borrowing more than doubled in 1995 to 13 billion dirhams from 5.2 billion dirhams in 1994, Bank al-Maghrib central bank said in its latest report.</p>
<p>A Casablanca-based stockbroker estimates at 19 billion dirhams the total amount of the Treasury bonds issues in 1996.</p>
