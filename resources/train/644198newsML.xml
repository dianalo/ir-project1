<p>Pietro Aglieri, one of Italy's three most wanted men and accused of some of the most violent Mafia crimes of the past decade, was arrested by police on Friday.</p>
<p>Palermo police chief Antonino Manganelli confirmed the arrest to Reuters and said two wanted hitmen -- Natale Gambino and Giuseppe La Mattina -- were detained with Aglieri at a house near Bagheria to the east of Palermo.</p>
<p>Aglieri, escorted by hooded police agents, was driven to police headquarters for questioning.</p>
<p>The operation was hailed as a severe blow to the organised crime gangs and the most important Mafia arrest since that of Sicilian boss Giovanni Brusca last year. Italy's most wanted man is fugitive boss Bernardo Provenzano.</p>
<p>&quot;The operation that led to the capture of Aglieri is confirmation that the state is serious in fighting organised crime,&quot; Manganelli told reporters, adding that a formal news conference would be held later in the day.</p>
<p>Aglieri has been sentenced in absentia to life for murder, although that has yet to become definitive in Italy's exhaustive appeals procedure, and 12 years for drug trafficking.</p>
<p>La Mattina has also been sentenced to life while Gambino has been sentenced to 10 years in jail.</p>
<p>Some investigators believe that the 37-year-old Aglieri may have taken control of Cosa Nostra after godfather Salvatore &quot;The Beast&quot; Riina was captured in 1993.</p>
<p>Nicknamed &quot;U signurinu&quot; (The young gentleman) for his supposedly refined manners, Aglieri had been on the run since December 1989 and is considered by investigators to be a right-hand man of Provenzano and ally of Riina.</p>
<p>He is accused of involvement in the car bomb killings of magistrates Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone in 1992 as well as of former European parliamentarian Salvo Lima in the same year.</p>
<p>The killing of Falcone, blown up with his wife and three bodyguards on a motorway near Palermo, was the mob's most outrageous attack on the state.</p>
<p>Police said various people known to be close to Aglieri had been tailed for months as part of the operation. None of the arrested put up any resistance.</p>
<p>Judicial sources said Aglieri became notorious in 1989 when &quot;pentito&quot; (turncoat) Francesco Marino Mannoia named him as the new boss of the Mafia family of Santa Maria del Gesu.</p>
<p>In separate police operations earlier on Thursday, 12 suspected Mafia members were seized in the southern heel of Italy, and six alleged mobsters were arrested in the Sicilian city of Catania on drug-related charges.</p>
<p>The old Italian Mafia leadership was effectively dismantled after the spectacular mob murders of Falcone and Borsellino, with Riina, his second in command Leoluca Bagarella and feared gangster Brusca all now behind bars.</p>
<p>However Italian police reported that the Mafia had retrenched, with Aglieri taking a leading role in re-shaping the depleted organisation.</p>
<p>His alleged chief lieutenant Carlo Greco was arrested last July in the coastal village of Buonfornella, near Bagheria, after seven years on the run.</p>
