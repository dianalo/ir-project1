<p>President Boris Yeltsin, said to be on track for his heart operation, threatened on Tuesday to crack the whip over Russia's fractious and independence-minded regions, Kremlin officials said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's doctor Sergei Mironov said preparations for the surgery were on schedule, which meant it would probably take place some time between next week and early December.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything's going to plan,&quot; Mironov told the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. &quot;No one has changed the schedule yet and we are following it.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has been given extra powers and will take over the helm during Yeltsin's operation -- a heart bypass to improve the flow of blood -- confirmed he would visit Chechnya soon to further the fragile peace process.</p>
<p>Mironov said he was confident that if all went well, Yeltsin would see out the second four-year term he won in July, but his absence has stirred a power struggle among potential successors.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin has been discreetly boosting his profile and a successful visit to the rebel region would help draw the limelight from ousted peacemaker Alexander Lebed, sacked from the Kremlin for his overt presidential ambitions.</p>
<p>The Kremlin on Tuesday issued the first of what it said would be a regular series of health bulletins on 65-year-old Yeltsin, who is resting at a sanatorium outside Moscow.</p>
<p>It repeated that his meetings had been cancelled to allow for final preparations for the operation.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said Yeltsin had spoken by telephone on Tuesday to his chief-of-staff, who is leading a conference on regional relations with Moscow.</p>
<p>Anatoly Chubais said Yeltsin wanted to meet leaders of the 89 regions and underlined that the Kremlin would seek to cancel any local decision which did not coincide with its policy.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be tough talks about this with the heads of local administrations,&quot; Chubais said, adding that some of them might not be pleased with Moscow's planned moves.</p>
<p>Yeltsin appointed the governors after the collapse of communism but elections are now taking place for the first time in 52 of the 89 regions, which could weaken his power over them.</p>
<p>Opposition communists and their allies have unseated the incumbents in five regions so far and are under pressure in several others.</p>
<p>Some of the vast Russian Federation's regions, especially those rich in natural resources, will also be watching closely to see what happens in Chechnya, where rebels have insisted on independence following an August 31 peace deal.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin gave no clue about when he planned to visit the region, where Lebed stopped 21 months of fighting before he was ousted from the Kremlin for insubordiation.</p>
<p>In a new sign of regional muscle-flexing, some local leaders have threatened to defy a Kremlin campaign to make up a big budget shortfall by targeting tax-dodging companies.</p>
<p>The budget crisis has brought industrial unrest and raised fears of instability in the armed forces, where defence minister Igor Rodionov is trying to implement long-overdue reforms.</p>
<p>But Yuri Baturin, the secretary of Yeltsin's Defence Council, said on Tuesday that a cash shortage was not the only problem. Another was knowing how many troops there were.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, no one can say how many people we have on active military service,&quot; he said, giving an estimate of 2.5 million servicemen -- more than double western estimates.</p>
<p>He said there were &quot;ghost&quot; troops, which -- in a hangover from Cold War secrecy -- did not turn up on budget documents.</p>
<p>&quot;When salary delays start it often happens because we allocate money for the &quot;documented' forces but they have to pay all, including military formations which formally do not exist.&quot;</p>
