<title>SOUTH KOREA: Samsung claims world first in 1GB DRAM development.</title>
<headline>Samsung claims world first in 1GB DRAM development.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1996-11-04</dateline>

<p>South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd claimed on Monday it had stolen a march on competitors by developing a &quot;fully working&quot; prototype of a one-gigabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the world's first to succeed in developing the fully working die,&quot; company president Lee Yoon-woo told a news conference, adding it was the last step before making an engineering sample.</p>
<p>Officials at Samsung, the world's largest memory chip supplier, said the company would soon start working on samples.</p>
<p>&quot;There were several foreign companies who announced success in developing circuit design for this product. But none of them has come up with a 'fully working die',&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>Lee said the company spent 220 billion won ($266.7 million) over the past two and a half years in developing a prototype, in which all the 1.07 billion cells fully worked.</p>
<p>He said the development was accomplished through the 0.18-micron-fine &quot;redundancy&quot; processing technology. But no further details were given on the technology.</p>
<p>Samsung, flagship unit of the giant Samsung Group, announced in December 1995 the development of a circuit design on the one-gigabit DRAM chip, which has four times the memory of a 256-megabit chip.</p>
<p>Samsung's major rivals, including NEC Corp and Hitachi Ltd of Japan, have also announced successful developments of circuit designs on the advanced chip.</p>
<p>Lee said the one-gigabit DRAM chip, capable of storing 100,000 double-spaced pages of typewritten text or 16 hours of audio data, were expected to be used commercially in the year 2002 or 2003.</p>
<p>&quot;The global market is expected to reach $70 billion to $80 billion a year by 2005, compared with about $90 billion for the overall memory chip market that year,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to remain in the lead of the world memory product market at least until early in the next century,&quot; a senior Samsung official said.</p>
<p>World's leading DRAM makers have said sample shipments of one-gigabit DRAMs will start as early as 1998, but Samsung did not give timetable for its sample shipments.</p>
<p>&quot;An important thing is that we are now ready to make samples in the very near future,&quot; said Lee.</p>
<p>He also said the technology accumulated in the development of the &quot;fully working die&quot; prototype would help the company cut production costs for other chips.</p>
<p>But stock market analysts shrugged off the announcement, saying that it was well overshadowed by the fears of shrinking profits in the 16-megabit DRAM chips, which are currently widely used in the global computer industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors would prefer to wait until they see commercial samples or any visible impact on the company's earnings from the development,&quot; said an analyst at Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>A glut of supply has dampened the international unit prices of both four- and 16-megabit DRAMs on the global market since early this year, causing Samsung and other major chipmakers to suffer sharp declines in earnings.</p>
<p>Samsung, which saw a whopping 165 percent net profit rise in calendar 1995, suffered a 60 percent drop in net profit for the first half of this year ended in June.</p>
<p>Its turnover rose to 8.71 trillion won in the six-month period this year from 7.06 trillion a year earlier, but net profit shrank to 453.4 billion won from 1.13 trillion in the same 1995 period.</p>
