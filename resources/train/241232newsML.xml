<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end mixed, spots up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mixed on Friday because big institutions returned money to the repo market due to the absence of new domestic A share issues, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most active seven-day contract rose to 10.65 percent from 10.51 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>Turnover plunged to 3.76 million lots from 7.84 million. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>There have been no new A share issues this week and some institutions returned their liquidity to the repo market, pushing down early-maturing contracts today, traders said.  </p>
<p>Traders expect the rates to recover early next week on the back of surging A share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up and traders said the rebound would continue early next week on bargain-hunting, with prices very low after successive falls in the past few months.</p>
<p>But the most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006, a market barometer, fell to 116.47 yuan from 116.86 yuan, indicating market sentiment had not improved much, they said.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the nine-contract market rose to 2.45 million lots from 1.98 million.</p>
