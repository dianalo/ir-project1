<p>The United States on Friday condemned a shooting incident in eastern Croatia in which a Belgian U.N. soldier was killed but said it appears to be the act of a single individual, not a broad threat to peace there.</p>
<p>A Belgian corporal was killed and two other U.N. officials were injured in the shooting incident in the Serb-controlled town of Vukovar in eastern Croatia on Friday, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States strongly condemns the attacks today on the United Nations soldiers by a Serbian gunman,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;We offer our deepest condolences to the family of the Belgian soldier who was killed in the incident. Two other soldiers were wounded, and we hope for their speedy recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>But Burns said the attack &quot;appears to be the act of a single individual&quot; who is now in police custody and under United Nations supervision.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted this was the first attack on U.N. forces since they began operations in Eastern Slavonia over a year ago and said U.N. military forces and the regional police under U.N. supervision are working to ensure such incidents are not repeated.</p>
<p>Vukovar is the biggest town in the Serb-held region of Eastern Slavonia which is due to return to Croatian government rule by mid-June. The town was devastated during the Croatian war for independence when Serb forces backed by the Yugoslav army laid siege to Vukovar and pounded it with artillery.</p>
