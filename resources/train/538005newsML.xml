<headline>Chrysler plant raid leads to charges for 29.</headline>
<dateline>FENTON, Mo. 1997-04-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>A police raid at Chrysler Corp.'s twin assembly plants here resulted in drug, gambling and theft charges against 29 people, including 26 Chrysler employees, police and the company said Friday.</p>
<p>The raid at Chrysler's minivan and pickup truck plants was the culminiation of an 18-month surveillance operation into gambling and drug-related activities within the plant, St. Louis County Police Officer Rick Eckhard said.</p>
<p>The operation was nearly identical to a May 1995 raid at Chrysler's Sterling Heights, Mich., car plant that resulted in the arrests of 19 workers on drug charges.</p>
<p>In both investigations, undercover officers posed as assembly line workers to gather evidence of the illegal activities.</p>
<p>&quot;Employees within the Chrysler plant who witnessed these activities contacted their management and that's when we got involved,&quot; Eckhard said of the Fenton investigation.</p>
<p>The most serious charges Thursday night include possession and delivery of marijuana, LSD, amphetamines and cocaine. Arrest warrants were issued for 22 people, while seven were due to receive misdemeanor summonses from the city of Fenton.</p>
<p>Chrysler spokesman Dan Mooore said 22 of the 26 employees involved have been fired for &quot;conduct not in accordance with Chrysler's ethics and policies.&quot; Chrysler is reviewing the status of the four other employees.</p>
<p>Police entered the plants and sealed exits Thursday evening and arrested about 16 people during the minivan plant's second shift. The rest were arrested at other locations, in part because Chrysler's other Fenton plant, which builds Dodge Ram pickup trucks, was idle due to an engine plant strike in Detroit.</p>
<p>Chrysler's officials quickly moved to say that such drug activity is not widespread among its work force, and added the company will act swiftly to eradicate it.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not believe the behaviors of the people arrested today are indicative of our work force here in St. Louis, nor do we believe it is fair to allow a small number of individuals to tarnish our collective reputation,&quot; said Dennis Pawley, Chrysler's executive vice president for manufacturing.</p>
