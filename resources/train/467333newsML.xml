<p>French shares were trading nearly one percent higher and above the 2,600 level as the market advanced in line with other markets, anticipating an increase in the U.S. Fed funds rate.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market had discounted a 0.25 percentage point increase in U.S. interest rates after the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting set to begin at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 15.31 points or 0.98 percent at 2,604.61 at 1447 GMT while the March future was up 28 points at 2,607. Volume was limited at 4.2 billion francs.  </p>
<p>Share prices came back slightly after the publication of March U.S. consumer confidence data showing it slipped to 118.5 from 118.9 in February, according to the Conference Board.</p>
<p>* Suez was up 0.97 percent at 280 francs and Lyonnaise was unchanged at 574 francs, ending a wild rally of two days on the back of merger speculation.</p>
<p>The Le Monde newspaper said this afternoon the merger would take the form of a bid by Lyonnaise for Suez. Traders had been expecting a Suez bid for Lyonnaise in a swap of two Suez shares for one Lyonnaise share.</p>
