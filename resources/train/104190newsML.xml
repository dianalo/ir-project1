<p>That bastion of quintessential Britishness, the highly successful retailer Marks &amp; Spencer, is preparing to take the German market by storm.</p>
<p>And judging by the dismal state of German retailing and the love of many Germans of English sartorial elegance, imagined or real, it is likely to be a big hit.</p>
<p>M&amp;S's traditional emphasis on &quot;quality, value and service&quot; does not sound like an empty slogan in Germany, where overpriced goods are sold with scowl rather than a smile.</p>
<p>That's why M&amp;S has flown its new German staff to London to teach them how to be nice to customers and tell them that the customer is always right, rather than wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;All our training efforts are devoted to good service. Germans say service in their country does not live up to expectations. We think we can make a difference,&quot; said Marc Bauwens, M&amp;S' general manager for the Netherlands and Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;Shopping will be a pleasant experience. People will be able to walk down wide, uncluttered aisles,&quot; he told Reuters, referring to a German retailers' irritating habit of filling shelves and blocking aisles with goods at peak shopping times.</p>
<p>The shop will be on Cologne's Schildergasse, Germany's fourth busiest shopping street, and is M&amp;S' second largest on the European continent after one on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris. It opens on October 10.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't be just another department store. Germany has plenty of those. That is why our slogan for this store is 'Not a department store but a philosophy',&quot; Bauwens said, a policy they are certain can win over service-starved German consumers.</p>
<p>Why has the company for so long shunned Europe's largest consumer market. After all, it is already present in 19 countries with 18 stores in France and 50 in Canada. It also owns 102 Brooks Brothers stores in the U.S. and 55 in Japan. The shops are usually in prestige downtown locations.</p>
<p>&quot;We looked at the German market in 1990 but decided real estate was too expensive. Now there has been a recession and property prices have fallen,&quot; said Bauwens.</p>
<p>&quot;The German market is huge. Spending on clothing and food is 50 billion pounds ($78.27 billion) a year. It is a big prize. We have learnt from mistakes we made in other countries and are poised to attack,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>M&amp;S plans to open more shops in other cities between Hamburg in the north and Frankfurt in the west once it finds suitable sites.</p>
<p>It also has a special system in place allowing it to restock products sold overnight as quickly as it does in its British stores -- another reason to enter the German market where shelves are often left empty.</p>
<p>When the company opened its Amsterdam store in 1991, it was an instant success with the 30,000 odd British who live in or near Amsterdam as well as with the Dutch, who keenly snapped up extra-long fit trousers and everything else to boot.</p>
<p>&quot;At last my wife has somewhere to buy her knickers,&quot; said the British ambassador at the Dutch store's official opening, referring to a habit supposedly shared by most British women.</p>
<p>With a population of more than 80 million Germans, M&amp;S could notch up impressive sales figures for its legendary underwear.</p>
<p>For the 150 staff being trained for the Cologne store a visit to a British store was a revelation.</p>
<p>&quot;They were amazed at how staff and customers in Britain are so friendly to each other. They found it a very moving experience and even had tears in their eyes when they left,&quot; Bauwens said.</p>
<p>He said of the 13 managers in the Cologne store, eight would be German and five British to combine local knowledge with M&amp;S expertise.</p>
<p>Marks &amp; Spencer is targetting German customers and not expatriate Britons. &quot;We will of course welcome British customers but they are not enough to sustain a store of that size,&quot; Bauwens said.</p>
<p>The many British people in the area are delighted about the new store, feeling it is like a chunk of home transplanted into Germany. One parent at the British school in Bonn even proposed making the opening day a school holiday.</p>
<p>Prices are likely to be higher than in British stores.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not be the cheapest but we will offer the best value for money. Germans do have an eye for quality.&quot; Bauwens said, adding that the store would offer larger clothes than in Britain to reflect the bigger size of Germans.</p>
<p>M&amp;S expects to create a niche for its convenience food, something which is almost non-existent in Germany. German food retailing has not yet woken up to the fact that many women work and do not have time to prepare a meal from scratch everyday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hoping to find a hole in the market. In Amsterdam we've built our food into a pillar of strength,&quot; Bauwens added.</p>
<p>The imminent liberalisation of shopping hours was just one sign that the German retail sector was being dragged kicking and screaming into the late 20th century, Bauwens said.</p>
<p>The new store will open the same weekday hours as other stores in downtown Cologne are planning -- 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. but on Saturdays only until 4 p.m. as shopping hours are not yet being fully relaxed.</p>
<p>&quot;We are always for longer shopping hours because we believe people should be able to shop when they want to. But Germany is highly regulated and everyone has to respect the rules.&quot;</p>
<p>The new store will -- unlike in Britain -- accept credit cards. It will not offer a loyalty card because this would fall foul of an antiquated German law forbidding discounting.</p>
<p>Sales are only permitted during four weeks of the year, two at Christmas, two in the summer.</p>
