<title>DUBAI: Dubai gold trade picks up on price slump.</title>
<headline>Dubai gold trade picks up on price slump.</headline>
<dateline>DUBAI 1997-07-06</dateline>

<p>Gold's plunge to a 12-year price low has stimulated retail turnover in Dubai's local jewellery and bullion markets but the main re-export trade to India remained sluggish, traders in the Gulf emirate said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Purchases of gold jewellery and bullion pieces, mainly by Dubai's large Indian and Pakistani expatriate community, had risen after several weeks of subdued activity after the yellow metal slumped to $325 an ounce, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The price drop has been good for business. Lower prices have attracted people back into the market,&quot; said a wholesaler, anticipating that the upturn in demand would prompt higher imports into Dubai from suppliers Switzerland and Britain.</p>
<p>Dubai's benchmark TT bar -- 3.746 ounces of 24 carat gold -- was quoted at 4,491 UAE dirhams ($1,223) on Sunday, down from 4,635 on June 29 and the year-high of 5,750 dirhams.</p>
<p>International spot gold was quoted on Saturday at $324.50-$325 an ounce, hammered to 12-year-lows by an announcement by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Thursday that it had sold 167 tonnes of gold to reduce its holdings.</p>
<p>Dubai souk-owners said that custom had picked up despite fears in other markets that gold was losing its role as a safe haven against inflation and currency volatility and that gold prices could fall further.</p>
<p>&quot;People have flocked to the market in the last two days...Buying is more of a tradition that an investment decision. Dowries and family gifts still have to be bought,&quot; said one souk seller.</p>
<p>A majority of Indian sub-continent expatriates based in Dubai go home during the harsh Gulf summer and many of these take gold back either as presents or as a way to tranfer funds rather that using the banking system.</p>
<p>Despite buoyant retail turnover prompted by &quot;bargain- buying&quot;, Dubai's main trade in re-exporting gold to India was flat with little sign that India was increasing direct imports.</p>
<p>Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the main feeder market to India which is the world's largest gold consumer.</p>
<p>&quot;It's unlikely that India will increase imports until the end of this month at the earliest...The profit (margin) is very little at the moment,&quot; said one wholesaler.</p>
<p>Indian import interest centred on silver which was trading at a 30 cents per tonne premium to the spot price which was last quoted on Saturday at $4.54-56 an ounce.</p>
<p>The Indian monsoon season from June to early September is traditionally a precursor to heavy buying by crop farmers in rural communities. Heavy rains have already fell, rising the prospect of strong festival gold demand later this year.</p>
