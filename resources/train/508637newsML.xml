<p>Poland's cabinet on Tuesday approved a compromise with the Vatican which may lead the parliament, dominated by ex-communists, to at last approve a treaty with the Apostolic See signed in 1993.</p>
<p>At a cabinet meeting in Warsaw, Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz signed a declaration clearing up controversial or unclear issues which had held up the concordat treaty's ratification by Polish legislators.</p>
<p>&quot;I want publicly to express satisfaction that after many months of negotiations with...the Apostolic See, the contents were agreed of the declaration which the Polish government accepted today,&quot; Cimoszewicz told reporters.</p>
<p>Parliament's refusal to ratify the treaty, which was signed by a previous pro-Catholic centre-right government just before losing elections in 1993, has long been a contentious issue.</p>
<p>If unresolved, it threatened to cast a shadow over Pope John Paul's May 31-June 10 visit to his homeland and be a key rallying point for the rightist opposition grouped around the pro-Church Solidarity union at September parliamentary polls.</p>
<p>Ex-Communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski, who visited the Pope this month, and Poland's foreign minister both argued for ratification, partly to show that Poland honoured treaties.</p>
<p>Members of the ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) have argued that the concordat, regulating church-state relations, risked giving the church undue influence.</p>
<p>They refused to approve it, at least until after a new Polish constitution was in place setting out religion's role.</p>
<p>Solidarity chiefs said this reflected deep anti-clericalism among ex-communists who persecuted the church in the past.</p>
<p>After years of debate since the 1989 fall of communism, a new constitution has been agreed by parliamentary parties and is due to be subjected to a popular referendum on May 25.</p>
<p>It is opposed by Solidarity partly because its world-view is too secular, but if it passes, the constitution will help clear the way for the concordat to be clinched.</p>
<p>The document approved on Tuesday is a unilateral Polish declaration but was settled in long secret negotiations with the Vatican and has the force of an agreement.</p>
<p>Among issues which is settles are an undertaking that the Catholic church will not start to refuse burial in Catholic cemeteries to people of other faiths or none.</p>
<p>Civil and religious marriages will have the same legal status and priests providing voluntary religious education in state schools will be treated like other staff and paid.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said that it made clear that specific questions would be regulated by Polish law, without infringing the sovereign powers of parliament or government.</p>
<p>He said the declaration would be sent later on Tuesday to parliament for inclusion in a legislative package ratifying the concordat.</p>
<p>Earlier he told a radio interviewer that parliament may be ready to vote on ratification in late May or early June -- at the time of the Pope's visit.</p>
