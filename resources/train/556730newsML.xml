<p>THE PROTEUS COLUMN</p>
<p>At the risk of tempting fate, Proteus notes that we're four months into the year and there have been no major insured catastrophes. The winter is all but over in the northern hemisphere and so far it looks as though claims experience will show nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>First quarter results from top international insurers have generally been positive in underwriting terms. Weather and catastrophe losses in the first quarter were well below the norm as has been reflected in U.S. property casualty results. Big name insurers such as Chubb, AIG and Hartford all reported improved operating results for the first three months.</p>
<p>In aviation, the number of total aircraft losses so far this year is within historical levels, and the last few months have been very quiet in comparison with recent years, with even attritional losses from minor events no cause for concern.</p>
<p>Space insurers breathed a sigh of relief after their recent conference in Venice. This Generali-organised event is often marred, coincidentally, by a launch or satellite failure. This year nothing went amiss.</p>
<p>The picture is much the same for marine, which has led the cyclical market fall in rates since 1994. Lloyd's members agency Christie Brockbank Shipton said earlier this week &quot;even a series of large losses would have little instant effect on the direct market&quot; because of the easy availability of reinsurance.</p>
<p>Natural disasters have also been notable by their absence. On the earthquake front there has been nothing to match Kobe or Northridge in terms of damage and insured claims.</p>
<p>This good news might be expected to fill insurers with joy. After all, the money hasn't been flowing out of their coffers in claims payments. However, at the same time, premium rates are under intense pressure, so insurers' income is weak.</p>
<p>The cynics will point out that we're approaching the hurricane season and things can't go on like this. They may be tempted to recall that old phrase from the movies, &quot;I don't like it -- it's just too quiet around here.&quot;</p>
