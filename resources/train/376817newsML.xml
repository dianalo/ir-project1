<p>Norway's largest shipping company Bergesen ASA on Thursday posted 1996 profits far exceeding expectations, but attributed the performance to a change in accounting principles.</p>
<p>Bergesen booked a profit before tax of 380 million crowns ($57.3 million) for 1996 compared with 489 million crowns a year ago and against an average forecast closer to 150 million crowns.</p>
<p>Operating profits were 575 million crowns versus 277 million in 1995.</p>
<p>The company said an extension of the depreciation period for tankers and dry bulk vessels -- to 25 years from 20 -- resulted in a reduction in depreciation charges of 153 million crowns.</p>
<p>In addition, a new accounting principle had been implemented for costs of classification and drydocking.</p>
<p>&quot;The operating profit would have been 75 million crowns weaker this year if last year's policy had been continued. The change in accounting principle also resulted in an extraordinary income of 61 million crowns,&quot; Bergesen said in a statement.</p>
<p>It later told a news conference that pre-tax profits would have been 91 million crowns under the old accounting system.</p>
<p>&quot;1996 was a year with few significant events in the markets where Bergesen operates,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;The year was marked by somewhat improved tanker rates and a comparatively flat development in the gas and dry bulk markets, and the results were in line with this trend.&quot;</p>
<p>Bergesen's A share was one crown higher in early, thin trade at 143 crowns. Analysts said the company's performance was difficult to gauge. Expectations for pre-tax profits had varied widely from 55 to 250 million crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;I am on a hold recommendation until we see exactly what's behind the figures. There's no reason the share should be up given that Bergesen says pre-tax is actually 91 million,&quot; said an analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it's their outlook which is helping. I think tankers are an interesting market over the next two years and the gas market should also have some potential for improvement.&quot;</p>
<p>In its outlook for 1997, Bergesen said the gas carrier market had reached the bottom and it expected a positive development in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;This improvement will not have full effect in 1997, which is expected to show results in line with 1996,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It forecast tankers would improve profits this year based on continued growth in oil consumption and a small order book. Dry bulk was expected to provide a result on par with 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, Bergesen expects an improvement in net profit before tax in 1997 compared to 1996,&quot; Bergesen said.</p>
