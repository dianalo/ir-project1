<title>JAPAN: Japan state nuclear firm head questioned by police.</title>
<headline>Japan state nuclear firm head questioned by police.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-07-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>The head of Japan's troubled state-run nuclear power firm was summoned for questioning by police on Wednesday as part of an investigation into a falsified report on a nuclear plant accident in March.</p>
<p>A spokesman at the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp (PNC) said its president, Toshiyuki Kondo, had been summoned by police. He declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>It is the first time Kondo has been questioned by Ibaraki prefectural police about the March 11 accident at a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, Ibaraki.</p>
<p>An Ibaraki police spokesman said he had no information on the case, but Kyodo news agency quoted police sources as saying Kondo was being questioned as a witness over the false report.</p>
<p>The Pacific coast plant operated by PNC was the scene of Japan's worst-ever nuclear accident when a fire and explosion exposed some 37 workers to low levels of radiation.</p>
<p>The company came under heavy public criticism when it later emerged that the initial report on the accident was falsified.</p>
<p>It was not the first time the PNC had faced public ire.</p>
<p>Its prototype fast-breeder reactor Monju, on the Sea of Japan coast, has remained closed since a 1995 accident in which sodium coolant leaked. No radiation leaked into the environment as a result of that incident.</p>
<p>An investigation revealed that PNC had tried to play down the scale of the accident by keeping secret a videotape of the scene and only making public edited video footage.</p>
<p>A PNC official who was questioning colleagues as part of an in-house investigation committed suicide after the revelations.</p>
<p>In April this year, the Science and Technology Agency ordered the PNC to halt operations of its Fugen advanced heavy-water reactor after learning that the firm had delayed reporting a radiation leakage.</p>
<p>A full-scale review of the PNC's business is now under way and some of the firm's operations are due to be scrapped or transferred to the private sector.</p>
<p>Key operations will be maintained, however. These are the fast-breeder reactor development programme and research and development on the management of radioactive waste.</p>
