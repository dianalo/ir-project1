<headline>Vietnam cop vows to tell all at drugs trial.</headline>

<p>A Vietnamese police captain facing trial on drug-trafficking charges has vowed to expose some &quot;extremely important people&quot; during the hearing this week in Hanoi, a newspaper said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the court, I will declare who has betrayed me and also I will expose some extremely important people...&quot; the Lao Dong newspaper quoted Interior Ministry Captain Vu Xuan Truong as telling investigators ahead of the May 2 trial.</p>
<p>Accepting that he could face a firing squad, Truong said he would reveal the information in exchange for an amnesty from a death sentence for his wife and brother, who also stand accused.</p>
<p>Truong also said he wanted an assurance that his body would be cremated after his death.</p>
<p>Twenty-two people, including 11 police officers and border guards, will be in the dock of the Hanoi People's Court on Friday for a hearing that is expected to last 10 days.</p>
<p>The scandal dates back to January 1995, when two Laotian nationals were arrested in Vietnam after they were found in possession of 15 kg (33 pounds) of heroin.</p>
<p>Drug experts say one kilogram of heroin would sell wholesale for $50,000 in New York, one of the growing destinations for heroin smuggled through Vietnam from the region's notorious Golden Triangle.</p>
<p>One of the Laotians, Sieng Pheng, earned a last-minute reprieve from execution in return for information that led to the arrest of about 30 people.</p>
<p>Pheng said the heroin found under the seats and inside the doors of his car was just part of his delivery and that more had been concealed in a false bottom of the car's fuel tank.</p>
<p>Five police officers, including Truong, were charged with stealing the drugs after the fuel tank was found to be empty.</p>
<p>The country's newspapers have reported widely on the case. Although none has openly said that more senior officials were involved, many have questioned how Truong could have acted as he did for so long with impunity.</p>
<p>The Saigon Giai Phong newpaper said a Vietnamese-Canadian woman recently sentenced to death for heroin trafficking could be linked to the same drug-smuggling syndicate.</p>
<p>The trial's presiding judge said in an interview that more than 10 people may be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>&quot;...if it can be fully proven during the trial process, then more than 10 offenders may be sentenced to death,&quot; Dang Minh Ngoc told the Thanh Nien newspaper.</p>
