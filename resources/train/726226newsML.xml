<headline>NYMEX Palo Verde power steady to higher on weather.</headline>

<p>NYMEX Palo Verde (PV) electricity futures were steady to higher Monday in relatively thin trade on hot weather in the U.S. Southwest, industry sources said.</p>
<p>As of 1220 EDT, August Palo Verde (PV) was up 38 cents at the day's low of $35.65 per megawatt hour (MWh) following exchanges as high as $36.00, while September was steady at the day's low of $29.30 after trade as high as $29.50 per MWh.</p>
<p>August California Oregon Border (COB) was trading up seven cents at $22.75 per MWh, while September was up four cents at $22.80 per MWh.</p>
<p>NYMEX said an estimated total of 52 PV and 107 COB contracts had traded as of 1140 EDT.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest was expected to see readings rising to one to five degrees Fahrenheit above normal with a chance of showers midweek, while the Southwest would continue to experience dry and seasonal hot weather.</p>
<p>Coastal cities from Seattle to San Diego were predicted to see temperatures in the 70s-80s and interior centers like Phoenix and Las Vegas are forecast to feel heat in the 106-111 degree range, according to Weather Services Corp.</p>
<p>Several Western generation units were set to return to service over the short term.</p>
<p>The 1,070 megawatt (MW) unit 2 at the San Onofre nuclear station in southern California reached hot shutdown status, which means the reactor is active but not putting power on the grid, as of Monday morning, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.</p>
<p>The adjacent 1,080 MW San Onofre unit 3 was scheduled to restart Thursday.</p>
<p>Also, the 1,158 MW WNP-2 nuclear power plant in Washington state was operating at 42 percent power early Monday and set to hit full power midweek after repairs.</p>
<p>The Washington Public Power Supply System unit took WNP-2 off line last Thursday to correct a cooling system problem.</p>
<p>A 750 MW unit at the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico was shut Friday for three weeks for repairs.</p>
<p>Also, the 750 MW unit 1 at the Navajo coal-fired power plant near Page, Ariz., was available for full operation but curtailed because of regional demand, a spokesman for the plant said Monday.</p>
<p>The unit was shut over the weekend for repairs to an air fan, the plant's operator said.</p>
<p>Navajo's other two 750 MW units were also operating below rated capacity based on market economics, he noted.</p>
<p>Restart of the 550 MW unit 3 at the Jim Bridger coal-fired power plant in Wyoming has been delayed until Wednesday due to a problem with fan bearings, sources familiar with the plant's operations said Monday.</p>
<p>The unit, which was shut Friday due to a boiler tube leak, was scheduled to restart Saturday, but now needs additional repairs. Bridger's other three 550 MW units were said to be operating normally.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 750 MW unit 2 at the Mohave coal-fired power plant was tentatively set to restart Friday after its startup was postponed from Wednesday. The unit in Nevada tripped off a week ago due to a boiler tube leak.</p>
