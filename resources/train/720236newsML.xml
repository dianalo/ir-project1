<title>UK: IPE oil futures fall after WTI-led plunge.</title>
<headline>IPE oil futures fall after WTI-led plunge.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE crude futures sank to a new session low on Thursday on the back of weaker-than-expected NYMEX crude, traders said.</p>
<p>August Brent was trading 31 cents down at $17.91 a barrel by 1501 GMT after sinking to as low as $17.85 after NYMEX opened.</p>
<p>NYMEX's WTI August contract, called to open 10 to 15 cents a barrel lower, was trading 28 cents on the downside at $19.18 after sinking to a session low of $19.07.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been totally dominated by the WTI which has tried its support level,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've reached support at the opening but now it is rising back up. When it went through the first support level that's when we started coming down. It's a mirror image of this morning when it (Brent) fell then retraced back up,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>Dealers were waiting for fresh news about when Iraq would resume its oil exports under its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.</p>
<p>July gas oil expired at $1.25 down at $161.25 and the new front month, August slipped further some 25 cents to $1.50 a tonne lower at $161.75.</p>
