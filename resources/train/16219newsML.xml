<p>Hong Kong shares were barely changed in quiet London business on Tuesday with most stocks trading around their closes, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There hasn't been much movement all day,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Except for Hong Kong Bank, which is a touch better.&quot;</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings was quoted at HK$134.65 after closing in Hong Kong at HK$134.5.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng London Reference Index was up just 3.82 points at 11,342.75 by 1346 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no real direction,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong on Tuesday, interest rate worries dragged the Hang Seng 86-points lower to 11,338.93.</p>
<p>&quot;If the (U.S.) long bond rally holds and the (Wall) Street is better then it will be reflected in what Hong Kong does tomorrow,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond at 1357 GMT was yielding 6.96 percent. U.S. bond yields were pushed above the 7.0 percent level for the first time in almost a month on Monday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere dealers said August index futures were unlikely to give direction as they were nearing expiry and prices were volatile. Hang Seng index futures closed 93-points lower on Tuesday at 11,285.</p>
