<headline>Mideast VLCCs stay at year highs, but less busy.</headline>

<p>Dirty tanker rates were mainly steady on Tuesday with very large crude carriers (VLCCs) from the Middle East continuing to hold firm at year highs, brokers said.</p>
<p>The 260,000 tonne Sylt was fixed at W74.5 Mideast/South Korea for Hanwha, while the 250,000 tonne Front Duke was done at W76.5 to Japan for Tonen, with the firm tone reflecting continued expectations of tightness in June, they added.</p>
<p>Brokers assessed VLCC rates to Singapore at a strong W72.5, only slightly lower than to Japan and South Korea and well above the average Mideast/East rate of W57.77 in April, according to data on Rigos Chartering Inc's Internet site.</p>
<p>But one broker said trade was less busy now than last week, and despite a fair number of private deals it seemed unlikely that rates would climb further.</p>
<p>West Africa/US Gulf VLCCs remained at around W60-65 while million-barrel (130,000 tonne) ships on this route were little changed at W95.</p>
<p>The cross-Mediterranean 130,000 market was very quiet, with rates slipping to W90/92.5, while a few 80,000 tonners (Aframaxes) were done on Tuesday at W107.5.</p>
<p>Fuel oil rates edged down five to 10 points on low enquiry, with 25,000 tonnes inter-U.K./Cont done at W245, still boosted by high Baltic exports, and cross-Med languishing at W190.</p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere, rates were little changed, with 70,000 tonne crude cargoes fixed at around W205-210 and 50,000 tonne fuel oil stems at W210, brokers said.</p>
