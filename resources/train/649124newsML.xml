<text>
<p>HARARE, June 10 (Reutetr) - Zimbabwe's money market was flush with cash on Tuesday morning, with short-term trading rates quoted mixed, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market opened short of Z$136.2 million, but liquidity was boosted with the maturity of Z41 billion worth of treasury bills.</p>
<p>To mop up the excess money, the central Reserve Bank auctioned Z$500 million worth of 91-day treasury bills, with an average yield of 24.49 percent. This compared with an interest rate of 24.50 percent at the sale of Z$270 million worth of 58-day paper on Monday.</p>
<p>A second auction for 55-day bills, was expected to raise Z$300 million on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, treasury bills were being traded on the secondary market at 23.75 percent, slightly up from 23 percent the day before, while call money was unchanged in a 20 to 22 percentage range.</p>
<p>NCD bills redeemable after 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought steadily at 26 percent but their selling rate edged up to 25 from 23.5 percent. Bank acceptance bills were quoted at 25 percent (buying) and at 24.5 percent (selling).</p>
