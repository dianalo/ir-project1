<p>Scandinavia's most powerful media famly, the Bonniers, took a first step into domestic Swedish television on Tuesday when Marieberg acquired a 16.7 percent stake in television station TV4.</p>
<p>Tidnings AB Marieberg, which is controlled by the Bonniers, has thus far mainly focused on newspapers.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a logical step,&quot; said Fredrik Grevelius, analyst at brokerage Carnegie. &quot;Marieberg has said it is interested in becoming involved in television.&quot;</p>
<p>The move could mean that the Bonnier family will emerge as a Scandinavian media mogul with tentacles into all kinds of media, entering in competition with Norway's Schibsted family.</p>
<p>Although analysts see the Bonniers' Scandinavian position as stronger than Schibsted's, the Norwegians are growing fast.</p>
<p>&quot;Marieberg is getting closer to Schibsted,&quot; said Ulf Hellzen, analyst at Swedbank in Stockholm. &quot;Schibsted has TV2 in Norway and TV Norge and it dominates the country's Internet operations and newspapers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Marieberg is the largest newspaper owner in Sweden and it is big on the Internet through (newspapers) Dagens Nyheter and Expressen. And now it has taken the step into television.&quot;</p>
<p>Marieberg also owns newspapers in Finland and Norway and through its 25 percent stake in Finnish media group Aamulehti Group it has a 18.5 stake in Finnish commercial television station MTV3.</p>
<p>Bonniers' snapping up of shares in TV4 could be a positioning for the electronic media of the future.</p>
<p>&quot;They will have their strong brand name combined with TV4's,&quot; said Peter Dahlander, analyst at Handelsbanken.</p>
<p>&quot;They could create something like Schibsted's Scandinavia Online in the future, something that could attract people on the Internet.&quot;</p>
<p>Bonniers could not do much with its TV4 stake besides watch and learn about television, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;They will not be able to decide much or use TV4 to put together advertising packages with its newspapers as Stenbeck would stop that,&quot; said Grevelius at Carnegie.</p>
<p>Holding company Kinnevik, controlled by media magnate Jan Stenbeck, owns 22.4 of equity and 25.6 percent of votes in TV4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Swedish Wallenberg family's financial empire holds 21.2 percent of TV4's equity and 24.2 percent of votes through its key holding company Investor AB.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bonniers will sit between Stenbeck and the Wallenbergs,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>He did not see any reason for the Bonniers to move into TV4 now as it has had chances to do so several times before. But others point to better times and a larger Marieberg cash pile.</p>
<p>&quot;When TV4 started at the beginning of the 1990s, times were rough and many forecast that private consumption would go down the drain with a negative effect on media companies' income,&quot; said Dahlander at Handelsbanken.</p>
<p>&quot;Now times are better and at this stage Marieberg's financial position is stronger than it was then.&quot;</p>
