<title>GERMANY: Domestic scene lends help to Bunds on choppy day.</title>
<headline>Domestic scene lends help to Bunds on choppy day.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>German debt markets had a choppy session on Tuesday, digesting domestic employment and industry orders data, warily eyeing the direction of U.S. Treasuries and witnessing a credit tightening in Britain.</p>
<p>Although Bunds and futures prices were wallowing in soft ground in late trade, players said domestic fundamentals should continue to support German markets for the time being.</p>
<p>The June futures contract dipped in and out of negative territory, trading as high as 101.90 and as low as 101.60, but was calmer in late trade, quoted down three basis points at 101.72 by 1400 GMT.  </p>
<p>Key support for the future at 101.61 held intact, prompting analysts to remain relatively upbeat about the near-term market outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;The cash market was pretty quiet again, and the future has wobbled a bit but basically traded the expected range,&quot; said one Frankfurt-based futures broker.</p>
<p>&quot;The German market is still well supported by fundamentals. Unless we get a clearer lead from the U.S., I expect we will continue to trade that range for the time being.&quot;</p>
<p>By 1402 GMT, the 10-year benchmark July 2006 Bund was quoted at 101.67, offering a bid yield of 5.772 percent.  </p>
<p>Analysts said that while a widely-expected 25 basis point interest rate rise in Britain did little to move European debt prices, news that the new British finance minister Gordon Brown planned to give the Bank of England more independence in setting monetary policy was mildly positive for Bunds.</p>
<p>&quot;Bunds were slightly supported by this, not least because this development increases the chances for the UK to join EMU eventually,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>But the new policy-setting system in Britain is still a far cry from the kind of independence required by the Maastricht Treaty for the planned single currrency, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Also, Gordon Brown said on Tuesday that he thought it was unlikely that Britain would be in the first wave of euro particpants in 1999.</p>
<p>At home, Bund prices were boosted early in the session by April unemployment data showing a seasonally-adjusted rise of 8,000 from March, and gained futher support from comments by Bundesbank council members Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher and Ernst Welteke saying the Bundesbank had no need to raise interest rates at the moment.</p>
<p>But a negative pull came from industry orders data suggesting the economic recovery was well on track.</p>
