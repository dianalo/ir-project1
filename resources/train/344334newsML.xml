<title>BELGIUM: Industry Council to debate competitiveness.</title>
<headline>Industry Council to debate competitiveness.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-01-30</dateline>

<p>European Union industry ministers gather informally this weekend to debate ways to boost the competitive strength of the Union, which is lagging behind that of trade rivals the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>The Dutch EU presidency wants the Council to hold an in-depth discussion on the issue at the meeting on Saturday in the Hague.</p>
<p>&quot;The main aim of the discussion is to decide how the Council is to schedule future talks aimed at strengthening the competitiveness of European industry,&quot; a presidency statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't belive there will be any sensations. Most people are aware of the problems that exist,&quot; one EU diplomat said about the meeting.</p>
<p>The discussions will centre on three recently published documents.</p>
<p>One is the Commission's working paper &quot;The Competitiveness of European Industry&quot;, published in November last year. It concluded that European industry is lagging behind the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>The second report to be debated is the Commission's recent evaluation of the results of the internal market, &quot;Report on the Impact and Effectiveness of the Internal market&quot;.</p>
<p>In that report, the Commission said the results of the internal market had been positive with the creation of more jobs, additional income growth and lower inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, these results clearly could have been better, which is why the Netherlands presidency wishes to arrange a discussion...,&quot; the presidency statement said.</p>
<p>Points for discussions include the fact that the potential of the single market has not been fully exploited, partly because not all proposals in the 1985 White Paper on the internal market have been fully implemented.</p>
<p>The internal market did not offer sufficient competitive incentives to new dynamic sectors and the integration process is too inward-looking, the Dutch statement added.</p>
<p>&quot;Overly detailed regulations hinder the competitiveness and adaptability of European industry. As a result, industry is unable to fully exploit the benefits of competition at internal market level, which could in turn boost the innovative capacity of the European economy,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Ministers will also debate a report by international consultancy Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton on the competitive situation of Europe's information and communication technology industries (ICT), seen as vital for the overall economy.</p>
<p>The report shows that Europe is falling behind also in this area.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe is not efficent enough to be a winner in low cost products, nor is it sufficiently innovative to be a winner in innovation-driven products. This position of being &quot;stuck in the middle&quot; must be overcome,&quot; the Dutch statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The picture painted by the benchmark study is worrying, especially as the ICT industry should be providing much of Europe's economic growth and employment,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>It said the Council could give practical form to its role as &quot;the guardian&quot; of European competitiveness by holding an annual debate on the subject.</p>
<p>However, it said such a debate would only be meaningful if it led to concrete action, for example starting a dialogue with industry to identify obstacles to their competitiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;The Council should make efforts to alleviate bottlenecks and, if necessary, draw attention of other Councils to these problems,&quot; it said.</p>
