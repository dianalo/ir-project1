<p>The last hardline ruler of communist East Germany denounced on Wednesday a court verdict holding the defunct state's leaders responsible for Cold War killings of people trying to flee over the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>Egon Krenz, facing manslaughter charges in his own separate trial, said the ruling was &quot;victor's justice&quot; and an outrage.</p>
<p>He acknowledged in an interview with Reuters that he is now one step closer to prison himself after the supreme court said former East German leaders could be sent to jail for ordering border guards to &quot;shoot to kill&quot; fleeing refugees.</p>
<p>Tuesday's high court ruling was issued against three former East German military leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly with this sort of victor's justice (jail) can no longer be ruled out,&quot; Krenz said. &quot;But there are still many, many unresolved issues. I will not capitulate to this country.&quot;</p>
<p>The Federal Constitutional Court rejected an appeal by three former members of East Germany's National Defence Council convicted in 1993 by a lower court. They are now set to start serving jail terms of up to seven years.</p>
<p>The long-awaited ruling meant the Karlsruhe court did not agree with claims by former communist officials that united Germany practised &quot;victors' justice&quot; against them.</p>
<p>The ruling eliminated an important line of defence Krenz was using. He and five other Politburo leaders face 47 counts of manslaughter for deaths at the Wall in a trial that has been compared to the post-war Nuremberg war crimes tribunal.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of the ruling is to criminalise East Germany,&quot; the 59-year-old Krenz said by telephone from his home in Berlin.</p>
<p>An estimated 800 people were killed trying to escape from East Germany, but Krenz said East Berlin was powerless to change a system dictated by Moscow that refugees trying to flee to the West across the fortified frontier should be shot dead.</p>
<p>&quot;The Constitutional Court missed out on a chance to send a signal that would put an end to the criminal persecution of East German citizens,&quot; Krenz said.</p>
<p>Krenz, who led East Germany for just three weeks in 1989 after Erich Honecker quit, has included in his defence a letter of support from former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>&quot;The court has put East Germany on the same level as the Third Reich,&quot; Krenz said. &quot;That is an outrage in view of the fascist crimes and West Germany's own shortcomings in dealing with the fascist past.&quot;</p>
<p>The supreme court ruling nevertheless found widespread backing among German commentators.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministers and generals may not have fired any shots themselves at the wall, but they were still killers,&quot; the liberal Sueddeutsche Zeitung said. &quot;The murder weapon was words and that was no less cruel or criminal than the Kalashnikov.&quot;</p>
