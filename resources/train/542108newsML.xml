<p>The dollar is likely to edge higher against the yen and may test 127 yen in Asia on Monday if a statement by the Group of Seven (G7) nations fails to yield anything new, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Chances the G7 statement is unlikely to yield anything new may lift the dollar to 127 yen, but then caution over intervention would likely grow,&quot; said a Japanese bank dealer.</p>
<p>A senior Japanese official said in Washington on Sunday that Japan and the United Stated had agreed not to specifically say what they meant by &quot;concern about recent developments of the yen&quot;.  </p>
<p>The G7 meeting ended a short while ago in Washington and traders are keenly awaiting the release of the statement.</p>
<p>After a weekend meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, U.S. President Bill Clinton told reporters: &quot;(It) is not our economic policy to go out and seek a weak dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Given this comment (from the U.S. side), chances are high that nothing new will come out of the G7 meeting,&quot; said the bank dealer. He said the market has been short on the dollar, with stop-loss buying expected to take place on rises.  </p>
<p>&quot;But the dollar's movements above 127 yen would become nervous because of possible dollar-selling intervention,&quot; said the Japanese bank dealer. &quot;If there is no sign of intervention, the dollar is likely to rise further to 128 yen,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The dollar rose as high as 127.16 yen earlier this month.</p>
<p>Even if intervention takes place and the dollar falls, bids by investors are expected to emerge at 124.50 yen, he added.</p>
<p>Another Japanese bank dealer said Japanese exporters are expected to sell dollars above 127 yen, which could slow the dollar's rise. Dealers said the dollar/mark is likely to move in tandem with the dollar/yen.</p>
