<p>Tanzania's air cargo market has grown rapidly over the past few years and in particular the domestic market is now showing signs of big potential, TNT Express World-wide said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Two years after establishing a licensed representative office in Tanzania, TNT has experienced growth of over 100 percent a year,&quot; Brian Holder, Managing Director of TNT's local office here said.</p>
<p>&quot;We opened our own office here because the potential is good. Business has been good and it's growing all the time. The total market for express mail is growing,&quot; Holder told Reuters.</p>
<p>He estimated the total market for courier mail in Tanzania to be worth some $3 million a year, most of which contains the shipment of documents, and an increasing part of which is taken up by the domestic market.</p>
<p>He said the north-western district surrounding Tanzania's second city of Mwanza at Lake Victoria, where the country's rapidly developing mining industry is located, in particular was seen as a high-growth area.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the business is documents and small parcels but another interesting aspect of the business is the domestic market, the shipments within the country, where I can see a big potential for growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Mwanza is a huge area for business with the mining industry being the most important which of course brings in the banking services as well and then there is some cotton business,&quot; Holder said.</p>
<p>He said TNT daily was shipping cargo with the local private airline Precision Air and the state-owned Air Tanzania Corporation to Mwanza, as well as to Arusha and Moshi in the country's northern coffee growing region.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen a 100 percent growth every year since opening our office in February 1995, inbound and outbound cargo is pretty balanced,&quot; he said, but declined to give any figures for the volume handled by TNT due to commercial reasons.</p>
<p>Holder said one of the biggest problems facing the air cargo industry in Tanzania was poor security at the airports and a lack of facilities.</p>
<p>While some improvements lately had been made in the security area there was &quot;still a long way to go&quot; before the situation would be fully satisfying, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Security at the airport is a huge problem, anyone can just walk into that airport, but I should say there has been improvements.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole area of cargo handling could need some advice and rehabilitation. And the clearing process needs streamlining, it can take three or four days to clear a consignment of spareparts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Tanzania TNT is also agent for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' cargo operation.</p>
<p>Holder also noted express mail companies registered as a courier service in Tanzania, contrary to other countries in the East African region, had to pay a special annual registration fee of $30,000. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017</p>
