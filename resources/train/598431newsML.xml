<title>FRANCE: French pilots strike, long haul flights unaffected.</title>
<headline>French pilots strike, long haul flights unaffected.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Pilots at national airline Air France and its short-haul division Air Inter Europe began a four-day strike on Tuesday, causing widespread disruption on European and domestic flights.</p>
<p>An airline spokeswoman said 50 percent of short and medium-haul flights were hit by the walkout but long-haul international flights were unaffected.</p>
<p>The strike, five days from parliamentary elections, is a resumption of a walkout threatened last month after talks with management broke down over plans to pay new pilots 15 percent less than current crews.</p>
<p>Six unions called the strike but one of the smaller unions, the SPAC, settled with the airline on Tuesday after the carrier agreed to pay student pilots who have been on a hiring waiting list according to the old pay scale.</p>
<p>The airline is planning to implement the pay cuts in a merger between the two airlines in order to make them more competitive as European airlines are opened up to cross-border competition.</p>
<p>Air France Chairman Christian Blanc had urged pilots to ignore the strike, saying it would wipe out the airline's entire projected profit for 1997/98 and endanger the future of the state-owned airline.</p>
<p>Unions accused him of over-dramatising.</p>
<p>The main pilots' union, SNPL, said support for the strike was strong and predicted its impact would increase over coming days. &quot;We are very well supported,&quot; said a SNPL spokesman.</p>
<p>Air France wants to hire 450 pilots in the next year and a half and would pay them gross starting salaries of 220,000 francs ($38,260) a year, a third less than the amount paid to the pilots now on staff.</p>
<p>The SNPL pilots union said an independent study shows the wages proposed for new pilots at the state-owned group are lower than those paid by Germany's Luthansa, British Airways and the Netherlands' KLM.</p>
<p>The SNCF state railway company said train traffic had returned to near normal after a six-day strike by train drivers. Disruption was limited to some inter-regional lines.</p>
<p>About one in three trains had been cancelled on most main lines between Wednesday and Sunday in the dispute over staffing levels and bonuses.</p>
<p>The stoppage had spared high-speed Eurostar trains to London through the Channel Tunnel.</p>
<p>In another protest, some 10,000 dairy farmers blocked deliveries to hypermarkets in various parts of France, accusing big distribution firms of gradually bringing down milk prices.</p>
<p>They set up roadblocks before dawn and turned back delivery trucks. &quot;We cannot accept a downwards price spiral until 2000, because we would never regain what we would have lost,&quot; a union spokesman said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe told RTL radio their grievances could be settled by talks. &quot;Conflicts are solved through talks...We have solved many of them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At least one union later called on farmers to suspend the protest as the government had called negotiations on Wednesday with farmers and representatives of distribution firms.</p>
