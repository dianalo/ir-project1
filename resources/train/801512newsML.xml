<p>Lithuanian shares maintained their recent rise on Friday and dealers were cautiously optmistic that foreign interest would lead to further gains next week.</p>
<p>Hermis Bank, the country's second largest private bank, was in the spotlight as 20 million litas worth of its shares changed hands in a block trade.</p>
<p>The official list index, which tracks the top five stocks, rose 13.37 points to 1156.59 while the wider group A index crept up 16.82 points to 1994.65.</p>
<p>Four of the five official list stocks gained with only one easing.</p>
<p>The central market saw 829,000 litas turnover while 20.54 million litas was registered in block trades.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the official list, which has been buoyed by positive results, helped pull up the rest of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The official list activated trade and I have the feeling that the same will continue next week,&quot; Arvydas Jacikevichius, a dealer with Suprema, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hermis Bank eased slightly to 271.00 litas from 271.10 litas in trade of 110,000 litas on the central market while 20 million litas of its shares were sold in a block trade at prices ranging from 176.30 litas to 272 litas.</p>
<p>Dealers said that 4.7 percent of Hermis shares changed hands.</p>
<p>They could not say who the buyer was but thought it was an institutional foreign investor as few local investors have such funds available.</p>
<p>Rokishkis Cheese  rose to 50.22 litas from 49.52 litas in trade worth 245,000 litas.</p>
<p>Dealers said that Rokishkis' promising interim results and good perspectives provide solid grounds for further growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Rokishkis (Cheese) is one of the most stabile companies in the country and it is one of the basic stocks of a Lithuanian investment portfolio,&quot; Grazhina Bachiuliene of Vilfima's asset managment firm told Reuters.</p>
<p>Vilniaus Bank rose to 315.10 litas from 310 litas on turnover of 35,000 litas on the central market.</p>
