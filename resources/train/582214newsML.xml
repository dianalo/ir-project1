<p>Russia collected 20.1 trillion roubles ($3.5 billion) in taxes in April, making up 80 percent of target or 25 percent more than first quarter monthly average, a tax service official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be named, said the tax service calculated revenues differently from the finance ministry and it took government debts cancelled in lieu of cash payments into account. He gave no comparisons.</p>
<p>He said budget revenues without these debt cancellations were 14.3 trillion roubles in April, the highest monthly level over the past two and a half years.</p>
<p>Low tax revenues are one of Russia's most pressing economic problems and had been a major obstacle to a resumption of regular payments of the International Monetary Fund's $10 billion three-year loan to Russia.</p>
<p>The IMF agreed to release more money last month after the Russian government submitted a new tax code, aimed at making the tax system simpler and more workable, to the parliament.</p>
<p>Officials said last month that Russia had met only 49 percent of the tax receipts target in the first quarter, although cancelled government debts raised total receipts to 69 percent of target.</p>
<p>Only 16 percent of Russian companies paid taxes in full last year. Official figures show that tax arrears rose to 128.25 trillion roubles ($23 billion) at the start of this year, more than twice the level at the start of 1996.</p>
