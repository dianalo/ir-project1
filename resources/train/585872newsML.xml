<text>
<p>A Belgrade court on Thursday sentenced a 72-year-old woman to seven years in prison for 22 crimes including 15 acts of &quot;banditry&quot;.</p>
<p>State news agency Tanjug said Andjelka Drakulic was also charged with theft and falsifying legal documents during a crime spree in 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>On the excuse that she was looking for a flat or room for her daughter, Drakulic preyed mainly on elderly victims who lived alone. When they opened the door she would suddenly fein weakness, and her hosts took her into their homes to offer her coffee.</p>
<p>According to the charges, Drakulic slipped drugs in her victims' cups and, when they dozed off, stole valuables and even food from their deep freezers. The drug she used has not been identified.</p>
<p>Judge Slobodan Rasic said the sentence took into account Drakulic's age and frail health, but also the fact that she had been convicted many times before for theft.</p>
