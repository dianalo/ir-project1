<p>A subsidiary of China's official Xinhua news agency has launched a national computer &quot;intranet&quot; designed to supply online companies with business and economic information and news, company officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>China Internet Corporation has set up the China Wide Web (CWW), which would supply clients with custom home pages and would provide news from international economic information providers such as Reuters Holdings Plc and Bloomberg.</p>
<p>China Internet officials said the company is a Hong Kong-registered firm majority-owned by the Xinhua news agency.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and overseas investors also had stakes in China Internet, the officials said, though they gave no details.</p>
<p>In January, Xinhua was appointed the government regulator for foreign suppliers of economic information in China.</p>
<p>The CWW would use technology designed for the World Wide Web, part of the global internet computer network, to supply bilingual information and services through its own domestic network, or &quot;intranet&quot;, said China Internet chairman Ma Yunsheng.</p>
<p>Ma said domestic economic information would also be available though he declined to say how many clients were expected to subscribe to the new service.</p>
<p>Overseas clients would be able to access CWW, which would help introduce Chinese companies to potential investors or customers abroad, other China Internet officials said.</p>
<p>They declined to give details of total investment in CWW, which will enjoy free use of Xinhua's communications network and would have links with the Internet.</p>
<p>CWW's all-business client base and added revenues from the provision of translation services would help ensure the viability of the new service, said Harry Edelson of Edelson Technology Partners, which has a stake in China Internet.</p>
<p>The company had an agreement for access provision from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are an access provider and they will provide access to us by contract,&quot; he said without giving details.</p>
