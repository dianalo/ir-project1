<p>Sri Lanka's defence ministry said on Saturday that 350 Tamil Tiger rebels and 161 soldiers were killed in this week's guerrilla raid on a northern army base.</p>
<p>Up to 700 rebels were wounded during Thursday's raid on the Paranthan army base, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Rebel Voice of Tigers radio, monitored by Reuters, said earlier they lost 140 fighters, including 78 women, and destroyed 11 artillery pieces and an ammunition dump.</p>
<p>The government earlier said 250 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels died and more than 250 were wounded in the attack in which 142 army soldiers were killed and 232 were wounded.</p>
<p>Hospitals in Colombo and other major towns were full of the army's wounded, newspapers reported.</p>
<p>The army said its soldiers destroyed the artillery pieces and ammunition dump themselves to prevent them falling into rebel hands after the Tigers breached army defences in a human-wave attack early on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rebel radio said the LTTE had captured three 120mm mortars, three heavy machine guns, rifles, artillery shells, night vision goggles and a large stock of ammunition.</p>
<p>The LTTE had recovered the bodies of 29 soldiers and was trying to hand over the remains to the army with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross, it said.</p>
<p>The army was mopping up on Saturday and rebuilding defences after fending off the assault on Paranthan, a key road junction town 280 km (185 miles) north of Colombo.</p>
<p>A large force of rebels, including suicide bombers and many female fighters, temporarily overran part of the town's defences early on Thursday in the fiercest fighting since last September.</p>
<p>One military official said in Colombo 20 rebel leaders were believed to have been killed in the fighting.</p>
<p>The LTTE is fighting for an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east of the predominantly Sinhalese Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>A London-based spokesmen for the rebels on Thursday denied the army claim of 500 rebel casualties.</p>
<p>Paranthan, which sits astride the main north-south highway from Colombo to Jaffna and controls the junction connecting to the rebel-held town of Mullaitivu, was the first military base to be attacked this year by the LTTE.</p>
<p>Security force officials told Reuters the rebels may have planned to cut off government-controlled Paranthan and Kilinochchi, just south of Paranthan, from the army's main bases in the northern Jaffna peninsula, and capture the artillery.</p>
<p>Government forces, which captured Paranthan from the rebels last July, pushed further into LTTE territory and in August took control of Kilinochchi, the last major town controlled by the rebels. The rebels have vowed to take back both towns.</p>
<p>In July last year, the rebels overran a key army base at Mullaitivu, killing or capturing more than 1,000 men and dealing the military its biggest blow in the war, now in its 14th year.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the conflict. The LTTE says the toll is much higher.</p>
