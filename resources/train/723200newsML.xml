<p>King Hussein of Jordan has said he felt growing despair over a breakdown in Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and blamed the Israeli government for the impasse.</p>
<p>The king said in an interview that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had broken promises and &quot;let the people of Israel down&quot; by stalling on commitments to Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;I really am despairing more and more about the situation as time goes by,&quot; he told the British Broadcasting Corporation in an interview shown on Jordan Television on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Three years ago Jordan became only the second Arab state after Egypt to sign a peace treaty with Israel. It then raced ahead of Cairo in normalising ties with the Jewish state.</p>
<p>But popular resentment to the peace treaty remains high. In March, when Israel began building Jewish settlements around Arab East Jerusalem, King Hussein publicly accused Netanyahu of dragging the Middle East towards bloodshed.</p>
<p>&quot;Prime Minister Netanyahu is a person who will be judged in time...I gave him all the support I could initially -- he was the choice of the Israeli people for the post of prime minister of Israel,&quot; King Hussein said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I must admit I am very disappointed in the performance as a whole of Israel and of its government and its leadership in the present and the recent past. I really hope we will see some improvement before it is too late.&quot;</p>
<p>Talks between Israel and the Palestinians on expanding Palestinian self-rule have been stalled since the start of the settlement building in March.</p>
<p>Earlier this year King Hussein helped broker a deal between Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Israel's partial withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron. The withdrawal, planned for early 1996, was delayed for months after Netanyahu won knife-edge Israeli elections last May.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that one of the most important parts of this whole process is that if you commit to something then you have to deliver. You have to deliver in the time agreed and in every possible way,&quot; King Hussein said.</p>
<p>Asked about the tone of his talks with Netanyahu when the two leaders met, the king said their meetings were always good- natured.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever we have met, that has been the case. But then what happens afterwards is a cause of concern and confusion,&quot; he said. &quot;We talk openly. We seem to have the same view. Certainly the same objectives. But then things do not seem to continue in a path that you could recognise or identify with what you have spoken about.</p>
<p>&quot;It does mystify me,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>King Hussein said Netanyahu had promised at a meeting in Washington months ago that he would announce measures that would surprise his detractors.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still waiting for the surprise,&quot; King Hussein said.</p>
