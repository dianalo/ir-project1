<p>Moslems and Serbs traded shots on Monday in a dispute over returning refugees in northeastern Bosnia and a Dutch United Nations police monitor was wounded in the exchange, a U.N. spokesman said.</p>
<p>Troops from the NATO-led peace force in Bosnia were despatched to restore order.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a police monitor wounded in the town of Koraj this morning after shooting broke out when about 500 Moslems attempted to return to their homes across the Inter-Entity Boundary Line,&quot; said U.N. spokesman Alex Ivanko.</p>
<p>&quot;At some point there was an exchange of fire...we have unconfirmed reports that at least one person (in addition to the monitor), a Serb, was wounded and evacuated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(NATO) has secured the area and there's a heavy presence of NATO troops and U.N. police monitors in the area.&quot;</p>
<p>U.N. sources in Tuzla said the wounded police monitor was a 50-year-old Dutchman who was shot by a Serb policeman, perhaps unintentionally.</p>
<p>Complete details of the incident, which were reported to have occurred around 0430 local time on Monday, were not available.</p>
<p>The Inter-Entity Boundary Line (IEBL) was established under Bosnia's Dayton peace accord to distinguish Serb-held territory from that controlled by Moslems and Croats.</p>
<p>The line was intended to be an administrative boundary but has hardened into a de facto ethnic border.</p>
<p>Ivanko said a number of Moslems had applied to return to homes in the village of Gajevi, on the Serb side of the IEBL, from which they were driven or fled during the Bosnian war and that those trying to cross at Koraj on Monday were among them.</p>
<p>Gajevi is located in northeastern Bosnia, northeast of the city of Tuzla.</p>
<p>The U.N. said review and approval of Moslem applications to return to Gajevi had not yet been completed and that Monday's movement was premature under currently agreed procedures.</p>
<p>Moslem refugees returning to villages along the IEBL east of Tuzla sparked violence on several occasions this year, as did some attempted IEBL crossings by Moslems intent on visiting their former homes.</p>
<p>Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, said spontaneous attempts to cross the IEBL such as the one on Monday were unlikely to advance the resettlement process.</p>
<p>&quot;It really doesn't help when hundreds of people go over the line (IEBL) and get themselves in trouble as happened this morning,&quot; Janowski said in Sarajevo.</p>
<p>But Janowski blamed Bosnian Serbs and Croats for blocking refugee returns across Bosnia and making a mockery of the Dayton peace accord, which will be a year old on November 21.</p>
<p>Scores of vacant homes in villages along the IEBL have been damaged by unknown forces over the past year in a successful attempt to prevent Moslems returning to their pre-war homes.</p>
