<p>Japan will take appropriate and timely measures against excessive currency moves, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will pay our utmost attention to future movements in the foreign exchange market and will take appropriate and timely measures against excessive fluctuations,&quot; Mitsuzuka told a regular news conference.</p>
<p>He said that an excessive strengthening of the yen as well as a weakening was undesirable, adding that stability of exchange rates was important for the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The G7 communique is still valid,&quot; Mitsuzuka said, referring to the agreement signed at the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Washington earlier this year which called for currency stability.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said the issue of Japan's current account surplus will likely be a topic of discussions among finance ministers at a G7 summit to be held in Denver later this month.</p>
<p>But he added Japan would like to hold bilateral meetings, as many as possible, before the June 20-22 summit to explain the issue.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said it was unlikely that Japan's surplus in trade and services would rise significantly in the medium term.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the tempo of the decline in the trade and services surplus is slowing, taking into account structural changes in the Japanese economy, it is unlikely that the trade and services surplus will rise substantially in the medium term,&quot; he said.</p>
