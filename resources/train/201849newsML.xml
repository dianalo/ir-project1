<p>Andre Agassi faced a cacophony of boos, whistles and jeers after a dismal performance against world number one Pete Sampras in his opening match at the ATP world championship on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Agassi, who said he had been ill for several days, was swept off court in just 48 minutes by Sampras who won the round-robin red group clash 6-2 6-1.</p>
<p>Shortly after the match Agassi hinted he might pull out of the prestigious season-ending tournament because of the problems.</p>
<p>But later organisers said they had received no notice of a withdrawal when they put together the schedule for Thursday. Agassi is due to meet Russia's French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov.</p>
<p>Agassi's brother and manager Phillip said: &quot;He hasn't indicated to me either way. But as far as I know all is good.&quot;</p>
<p>The 12,000-strong crowd, who paid between 180 and 230 marks ($120 and $153) to watch Wednesday's three matches, cheered the Las Vegas player at the start of the match.</p>
<p>By the end they were booing and whistling loudly at being deprived of entertainment from a match which, on paper, was a classic showdown between two grand slam champions.</p>
<p>Agassi, who was also destroyed by Sampras at last month's Stuttgart Open, put his poor form down to a stomach upset and influenza.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt pretty weak. I was not fit to play well,&quot; the world number seven said. &quot;It was not enjoyable going out like that. I thought about withdrawing before the tournament started. I felt pretty close. It is possible that I might (still) pull out.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the reaction of the crowd, Agassi  said: &quot;I hardly blame them. I wasn't playing well. I felt worse than they did.&quot;</p>
<p>Agassi played erratic tennis from the start. He was in trouble on his own serve as early as the fourth game when he had to save several break points. Sampras, who served and volleyed well, eventually broke in the sixth game and went on to take the set in 29 minutes.</p>
<p>After that Agassi's game fell apart and the match was no longer a contest.</p>
<p>The crowd started expressing their anger after Agassi double-faulted to give Sampras a 4-0 lead in the second set.</p>
<p>The championship, which brings together the top eight players in the world, is played in a round-robin format in the early stages. The top two players from each of the two groups advance to the semifinals.</p>
<p>Agassi still has to two tough group matches ahead against Australian Open champion Boris Becker and Kafelnikov. Sampras will play Becker in Thursday's biggest match.</p>
<p>Becker beat the world number one over five sets in last month's Stuttgart Open final.</p>
<p>Earlier, Michael Chang's hopes of reaching the decisive stages suffered a setback when he lost to Thomas Muster, his second defeat in the white group.</p>
<p>The American world number two, who lost his opening match to Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek in straight sets on Tuesday, went down 6-4 6-3 after a baseline battle.</p>
<p>Chang reached the final last year.</p>
