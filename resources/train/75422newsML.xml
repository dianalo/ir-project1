<p>Shanghai B shares closed down on Wednesday in dull trading, with overseas selling likely to push the index down to test the 47-point resistance level in the short term, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index slipped 0.272 points or 0.56 percent to 48.564 points, on volume of 9.0 million shares worth $3.5 million. Of 41 B shares, 32 traded, with 17 down, seven flat and eight up.</p>
<p>Brokers said that the index will fall further on overseas selling pressure with the approach of the National Day holiday, which lasts five days from Sept 28 to Oct 2, and after a ban on domestic investors buying B shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;The interim results of most listed firms were too poor to attract overseas capital,&quot; one broker said. &quot;This bearish mood will not change in the short term despite domestic institutional support.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Technical charts showed the index has little chance of rebounding before it tests the 47-point support level, which also prevented investors from building positions,&quot; a second broker said.</p>
<p>Shanghai Jintai was the biggest loser on speculative selling, plunging $0.020 or 12.65 percent to $0.138, on volume of 18,000 shares.  </p>
<p>Tientsin Marine, Tuesday's star, was the second biggest loser on profit-taking, falling $0.016 or 4.76 percent to $0.320, on volume of 121,500 shares.</p>
<p>Eastern Communications traded the most on institutional cross-trading, rising $0.036 or 5.38 percent to $0.704, on volume of 1.6 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai A shares ended down on a technical correction after sharp gains in the past few days, but market sentiment remained positive, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The A index fell 15.732 points or 1.76 percent to 875.709 points, on volume of 503.2 million shares worth 5.1 billion yuan. The SSE 30 ended down 33.657 points or 1.42 percent to 2339.845 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Steel Tube was the biggest loser on speculative selling just before the close, plunging 1.17 yuan or 20.63 percent to 4.50 yuan, on volume of 104,900 shares.</p>
