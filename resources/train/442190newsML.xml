<title>COTE D'IVOIRE: Ivory Jan cocoa bean exports fall, cumulative up.</title>
<headline>Ivory Jan cocoa bean exports fall, cumulative up.</headline>
<dateline>ABIDJAN 1997-03-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ivory Coast cocoa bean exports dropped to 137,664 tonnes in January from 166,268 in December, but the cumulative total was up on the 1995/96 season, official shipping data show.</p>
<p>The January 1996 figure was 164,958 tonnes.</p>
<p>Cumulative exports for the first four months of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) were 447,406 tonnes, up from 435,215 in the same period of 1995/96 and 403,764 in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Traders said exports in 1995/96, Ivory Coast's record production year, had been slowed by a shipping dispute over freight rates before shipments picked up again in January.</p>
<p>Exports in January 1996/97 were slowed by low world prices and demand, they said.</p>
<p>Figures show that 99,525 tonnes of January 1997 bean exports were shipped from Abidjan with 38,114 tonnes leaving via San Pedro.</p>
<p>In 1995/96, Abidjan handled 110,721 tonnes of January exports with 54,237 tonnes leaving via San Pedro.</p>
<p>Traders said some exporters had stored cocoa rather than shipping in December to earn higher prices expected for March contracts.</p>
<p>Some said they had paid too much for December export contracts through Ivory Coast's electronic export contract auction system which was set up in April 1996.</p>
<p>Warehouse stocks have remained high since December but exporters expect large shipments to leave this month. March cocoa prices hit seven-month highs in New York this week.</p>
<p>Auction rules, which some traders say encourage exporters to overbid to secure export contracts, are under review by donors and the Caistab cocoa marketing body.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast produced 1.2 million tonnes of cocoa in 1995/96. It originally forecast 950,000 tonnes for 1996/97 but Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze said this week no more that 800,000 was available for sale.</p>
<p>Cocoa arrivals were in a 920,000 to 960,000 tonnes range by March 7 (since October 1) with most estimates between 920,000 tonnes and 940,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Prospects for mid-crop volumes arriving at ports from April onwards are still being assessed by crop analysts.</p>
