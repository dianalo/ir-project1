<headline>UK's Major silent on election date.</headline>

<p>Prime Minister John Major refused on Friday to give any clue as to the date of Britain's election.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference, Major said he was not ruling anything in or anything out.</p>
<p>&quot;I will pick my own time, I will do it in my own way and I'm giving you no nods, no winks. And if you pick up nods and winks from anybody else, let me tell you now you are safe to ignore them -- because at the moment they don't know and I do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Major must hold an election by May 22.  </p>
<p>Major dismissed as &quot;complete rubbish&quot; a MORI opinion poll in Friday's Times newspaper showing Labour 25 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.</p>
<p>He said he was convinced the Conservative would win their fifth consecutive election and said the party's own tracking polls gave a totally different picture to the MORI poll.</p>
<p>Major launched a scathing attack on Labour's tax and spending policies, saying comments this week by prominent Labour figures Michael Meacher and Nick Brown showed their gut instinct was to raise taxes. --London newsroom +44 171 542 7950</p>
