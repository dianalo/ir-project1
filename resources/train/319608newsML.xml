<p>Environmental and consumer groups filed a legal challenge in Switzerland on Monday aimed at blocking the marketing of genetically altered soybeans and soya products in the country.</p>
<p>A coalition of activists including international environment group Greenpeace said it lodged a complaint with the Interior Ministry against a government agency's ruling to allow gene soya in Switzerland from February 1.</p>
<p>The administrative complaint asked the ministry to reverse a December ruling by the Federal Health Agency (BAG), which gave the green light for products from soybeans developed by U.S. chemicals giant Monsanto Co to resist its own weedkiller Roundup.</p>
<p>An Interior Ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the the contents of the complaint, which claims the BAG granted permission without receiving all pertinent documents and risk tests.</p>
<p>Under Swiss law, the administrative complaint could halt the BAG ruling from taking effect before the case is settled.</p>
<p>The ministry can decide on its own to let the soya ruling take effect as of February 1 while the complaint is still pending.</p>
<p>But the activist groups said they would fight any such decision and could appeal to the high Federal Court to bar gene soya until the subject of the complaint is ruled on by the ministry.</p>
