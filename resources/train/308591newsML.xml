<p>Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's plan to stand for a second term faced its first hurdle in Congress on Wednesday when a Chamber of Deputies panel was due to vote on a reform allowing re-election.</p>
<p>Government leaders said they were confident of victory in the committee vote, which was scheduled for 1000 local/1200 GMT, after being assured by the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) that its members would vote in favor of the amendment.</p>
<p>A PMDB convention on Sunday, which was dominated by the party's anti-government wing, recommended its lawmakers not to vote on re-election until February 15, forcing government leaders to postpone Tuesday's scheduled panel vote on re-election.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday, pro-government leaders within the PMDB said they had convinced the party's six deputies sitting on the panel to vote in favor of the amendment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dep. Inocencio Oliveira, leader of the government-allied Liberal Front Party in the lower house, said he expected the committee to vote 19-11 in favor of re-election.  </p>
<p>But there was no sign of when re-election might be put to the first of two votes on the Chamber of Deputies floor, the next stage in the bill's long journey through Congress and considered its biggest challenge.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll take things step by step,&quot; Deputy Jose Anibal, lower house leader of Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democratic Party, told national CBN radio.</p>
<p>The government needs a three-fifths majority in each of the two votes on the Chamber of Deputies floor and needs the support of the PMDB, the largest party in the lower house.</p>
