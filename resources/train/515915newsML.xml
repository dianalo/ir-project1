<p>The U.S. Treasury market will examine an early April consumer sentiment reading on Friday, then will have little to do except enjoy its support at current levels and wait for much more key data coming the week after next, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey could have some influence if there is movement either up or down but having said that, confidence measures have been telling us that households feel good about the economy,&quot; said Daiwa Securities America chief economist Michael Moran.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're waiting for more data and I suspect that people have their eyes on three indicators coming out not next week, but the following week -- the Employment Cost Index (ECI), real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for the first quarter and the employment data for April,&quot; said Moran. &quot;All three are important numbers and they'll be the most important numbers before the May meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Friday and all next week will be quiet,&quot; Moran said.</p>
<p>William Sullivan, senior vice president and fixed income research director at Dean Witter Reynolds said the bond market had found support had current levels.  </p>
<p>&quot;The bond market has been rescued by the CPI,&quot; said Sullivan, referring to the more subdued March Consumer Price Index (CPI) released on Tuesday. &quot;It's got a good tone.&quot;</p>
<p>Sullivan said the March CPI would make it very tough to sell off the market anytime in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The CPI is clearly a legacy that lives on,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sandy Batten, senior economist at Citicorp Global Finance N.A., agreed that the market &quot;seems to be relatively comfortable with yield levels where they are.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury bond was up 12/32 to 94-17/32 in late afternoon trade on Thursday, yielding 7.07 percent.  </p>
<p>Batten said the Employment Cost Index (ECI) would be the next statistic of intense interest to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Until then, there will not be much to go on,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc., said market bears are likely to have leaner pickings in the second quarter of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The bond market outlook has become sort of constructive,&quot; said Glassman. &quot;We've had a lot of bearish news and it's a long way between now and the next Federal Reserve meeting.&quot;</p>
<p>Glassman said consumer spending and growth will probably slow a little in the second quarter.  </p>
<p>&quot;It will be hard to remain as bearish with all this news,&quot; said Glassman.</p>
<p>Dealers indicated that Federal funds would open between 5-3/8 percent and 5-7/16 percent on Friday.</p>
