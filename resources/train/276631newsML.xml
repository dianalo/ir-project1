<p>After weathering a sluggish economy in 1996, local business leaders hope Panama will spur its growth next year on the strength of tourism, banana exports and free zone trading.</p>
<p>A potential round of privatizations and go-aheads for stalled mining projects might also prod the economy to grow beyond 1996's anemic 1.9 percent rate, they say, to reach the government- projected 2.3 percent rate for the coming year.  </p>
<p>&quot;I want to be optimistic about 1997,&quot; said former vice president Guillermo Ford and now a banking and insurance executive in an echo of the cautious optimism felt by business leaders.</p>
<p>Banana exports, the country's main export earner, are expected to improve after slumping an estimated 6.5 percent in 1996 on storms and labor disputes.</p>
<p>Other expected bright spots for 1997 include tourism and the service sector as Panama adds about 1,000 hotel rooms.</p>
<p>The free trade zone in Atlantic port city of Colon should improve with the abolition of a 15 percent tax on foreign sales.  </p>
<p>And a slew of port, telecommunication and electricity privatizations carried over from 1996 could bring hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>Although the government has not established a figure for what it expects to receive from the privatizations &quot;what we're looking at is a huge investment package, not money over the table,&quot; said Alfredo Macia, head of Panama's privatization unit.</p>
<p>&quot;We want these people to commit for the long term, to pay taxes, hire people and improve our technology,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>While blessed with low inflation and the world's busiest canal, increased foreign investment forms part of Panama's strategy to overcome decades of dictatorship that left an unstable economy and large commercial debts.</p>
<p>Two years of U.S.-imposed economic sanctions compounded the problem, until a December 1989 U.S. invasion toppled strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.</p>
<p>That brought a one-off 9.7 percent surge in economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;But no-one thought: what happens if this doesn't last?&quot; said Mario de Diego Jr, executive director of Panama's National Bank Association.  </p>
<p>Construction, which was up 1.3 percent in 1995 is expected to plummet 3.0 percent this year. Manufacturing is expected to rise only 0.7 percent. And with unemployment at 15 percent of the 2.4 million population a recent United Nations-sponsored report said Panama had one of the worst income distributions of the region.</p>
<p>Economic policy making has since moved to the foreground -- Panama recently joined the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>But business leaders say regulatory uncertainty in the mining sector and in the development of the so-called reverted areas cloud 1997's prospects.  </p>
<p>The United States plans to turn over control of the Panama Canal and seven bases and withdraw all troops by Dec. 31, 1999. Panama is expected to lose up to $370 million a year in revenue.</p>
<p>However until Congress passes a land-use law for the reverted areas, investors can develop the lands but not own them, de Diego said.</p>
<p>The most grandiose plan is to turn former U.S. World War II base Fort Amador into a $450 million hotel, cruise ship terminal and recreational complex.</p>
<p>Panama's mining future also remains uncertain.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm completely lost about the government's position on mining,&quot; de Diego said. &quot;The government could have had $200 million in investments this year, but projects that were expected to be approved weren't.&quot;</p>
<p>Government officials have promised to give the green light to eight mining exploration contracts which were held up in 1996 over minor differences.</p>
<p>&quot;Panama wants mining and all kinds of foreign investment,&quot; said assistant comptroller general Gustavo Perez. &quot;But we will only approve projects that conform to the law.&quot;</p>
