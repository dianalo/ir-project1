<p>Flughafen Frankfurt Main AG (FAG), owner and manager of Frankfurt airport, plans &quot;moderate&quot; rises in landing fees next year, the airport's chairman Wilhelm Bender said on Friday.</p>
<p>He told a news conference increases were needed to finance 9.5 billion marks of investment in terminal and other infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>&quot;A moderate increase in landing fees has been applied for in 1997,&quot; he said, without giving further details.</p>
<p>Bender added that FAG had frozen handling fees -- which make up 38 percent of revenue -- since 1993 to meet client needs.</p>
<p>It was too early to judge if this summer's 50 percent cut in night landing fees for freighters was a success due to the length of airline planning, he said.</p>
<p>But he forecast: &quot;The freighter fee reduction has been very positively received. We expect that this will show up in the next flight schedules.&quot;</p>
<p>Bender also called on German airports to have more say on slot allocation than under the present structure where a federal co-ordinator was responsible.</p>
<p>&quot;We see the slot as our production factor. It is the time factor in which airlines can use us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is airport production, not airline production, and we want to be more involved more strongly in (slot) talks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Frankfurt airport would increase its hourly total of slots to 74 in 1997 from this year's 72, Bender said.</p>
