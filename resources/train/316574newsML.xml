<p>Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty, boosted by three birdies in five holes on his back nine, opened up a one-shot lead after the third round of the South African Masters on Saturday.</p>
<p>The dapper McNulty, who began the day a stroke behind halfway leader Adilson da Silva, played solidly for 17 holes at a blustery San Lameer Country Club on his way to a 70 and a 54-hole total of 209.</p>
<p>Yet the Zimbabwean's advantage could have been even better as he aims for his fourth South African Masters title.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old Volvo Masters champion had stretched his lead to three strokes at eight-under for the tournament when indecision at the last saw him run up a double bogey six after his drive found water.</p>
<p>&quot;The round took over five hours and I was dithering on the 18th tee between taking my driver or a two iron, and I should have chosen the two iron,&quot; he said. &quot;But it was my first double bogey of the week so I can't really complain.&quot;</p>
<p>The 24-year-old da Silva, who handled the pressures of the gusting winds and McNulty's challenge well for the first nine holes, faltered over the homeward nine for a level-par 72 which leaves him second on 210.</p>
<p>&quot;I began well and had good rhythm. But, after the first nine holes, I was a little excited and I then lost a bit of concentration and some confidence...I also hit a few poor shots. But anything can happen in the final round,&quot; da Silva said.</p>
<p>South African Deane Pappas, who eagled both par-fives on the homeward nine, carded a 69 for third place on 214.</p>
<p>American-based South African Ronnie McCann aced the par-three ninth, holing out from 199 metres with a six iron on his way to a 70 which leaves him joint 12th place on 219.</p>
