<title>DUBAI: Saudi lawyer says British nurses admitted murder.</title>
<headline>Saudi lawyer says British nurses admitted murder.</headline>
<dateline>DUBAI 1997-01-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two British nurses charged with murder in Saudi Arabia admitted to their involvement in the killing, and one confessed to having a lesbian relationship with the victim, their Saudi lawyer said on Sunday.</p>
<p>But the law firm of Salah al-Hejailan said Deborah Parry, 41, and Lucille McLauchlan, 31, later withdrew their confessions to the murder of Australian colleague Yvonne Gilford, 55, at the King Fahd military hospital complex where they worked.</p>
<p>The women said police had promised the confessions would be their ticket home.</p>
<p>Parry also denied an earlier admission to a sexual relationship with the victim.</p>
<p>&quot;Both nurses said that they had provided written statements admitting their involvement in the murder of Yvonne Gilford,&quot; a statement by the law firm issued at the request of the two suspects said.</p>
<p>If found guilty, the women could be publicly beheaded in line with Islamic sharia law in force in the kingdom. But the victim's family could spare their lives by accepting blood money for the crime.</p>
<p>&quot;(The suspects) said that they had made these statements to the police because they were promised that if they did so they would be allowed to see the British consul, would be sent home in two to three weeks and would not be subject to prosecution in Saudi Arabia,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The statement, faxed to Reuters from the law firm in Riyadh, was issued after their lawyer Salah al-Hejailan and a group of his colleagues went to see the two women in prison in the eastern Saudi city of Dammam on Saturday. British Consul Tim Lamb, who had previously visited the women in prison, was also present.</p>
<p>The nurses were arrested and jailed on December 20, nine days after Gilford was found stabbed and bludgeoned to death.</p>
<p>The law firm's statement said a senior police officer had been present in the room throughout the meetings between the women and the lawyers.</p>
<p>&quot;The written statements (of confessions) included an admission of a lesbian relationship between Deborah Parry and Yvonne Gilford. Deborah Parry vehemently denied to us that such a relationship had existed,&quot; the law firm said.</p>
<p>&quot;The written statements also included an admission that the two nurses had taken Yvonne Gilford's bank cash card after the murder and had used this to withdraw cash on several occasions over the following days. Both nurses again strongly denied this to us,&quot; the firm said.</p>
<p>Saudi newspapers have said the two were arrested while using the victim's cash card at a shopping mall.</p>
<p>The law firm said both women, who appeared well but concerned at their situation, had arrived in Saudi Arabia only a few weeks before the murder.</p>
<p>&quot;Naturally, having only very recently arrived in Saudi Arabia, both nurses were very confused and apprehensive when they were arrested and charged at the police station with the murder,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The firm said police in Dammam had been very cooperative in arranging the meetings with the two suspects.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that a comprehensive police report will soon be finalised and submitted to the Saudi authorities to decide the appropriate procedure for dealing with this matter,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The withdrawal of the written statements by both nurses obviously changes the complexion of the case and we will be discussing this with the relevant authorities as soon as possible,&quot; it said.</p>
