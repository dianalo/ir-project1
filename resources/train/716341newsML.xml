<p>Indonesian palm olein prices were generally stable in late trading on Wednesday, with buying interest staying thin on a lack of fresh leads, traders said.</p>
<p>They said palm olein was quoted at 1,395-1,400 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, unchanged from the opening. Crude palm oil was done at 1,174 rupiah/kg and 1,175 rupiah at a tender for two parcels of 2,500 tonnes and 1,500 tonnes in Medan on Wednesday. A 500-tonne was done at 1,180 rupiah/kg on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was moving sideways in the absence of leads,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The market is still smarting from yesterday's steep falls in prices in Malaysia and Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>The traders said there were still some unanswered questions over the new export tax structure for crude palm oil and products announced on Monday as part of the country's economic deregulation package.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still not clear on how the tax structure will impact oil being shipped to Rotterdam for storage,&quot; one said. &quot;Since the shipment has not been sold yet, how will the tax on such cargoes be determined when they leave Indonesia.&quot;</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Monday the export tax on crude palm oil was five percent, that on palm olein two percent, palm oil four percent and crude olein four percent.</p>
<p>He said the taxes on crude palm oil and its products averaged 10-12 percent between 1994 and last year.</p>
<p>A finance ministry official said on Tuesday the taxes were effective from July 1 and would be based on the free-on-board price on the day the importer opens the letter of credit.</p>
