<title>USA: School funding to dominate Ohio Legislature.</title>

<p>School funding reform will be a top issue for the Ohio Legislature as lawmakers await the state's high court ruling on the constitutionality of the current funding system, according to aides to House and Senate leaders.</p>
<p>Cheryl Burchard, spokeswoman for House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg, said the House is expected to take up an education reform package that will include funding and assistance for school buildings.</p>
<p>The legislature returns to session this week.</p>
<p>Teri Geiger, chief of staff for Senate President Elect Richard Finan, R-Evendale, agreed that lawmakers will be tackling school issues as part of a new fiscal 1998-99 biennial budget.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ohio Supreme Court is expected to rule shortly on whether the state's current public school funding system is constitutional.</p>
<p>In July 1994, a Perry County Common Pleas Court judge found the system to be unconstitutional because it resulted in wide disparities between wealthy and poor school districts. That ruling was overturned in August 1995 by a state appeals court.</p>
<p>&quot;So much hinges on what the supreme court says,&quot; Geiger said.</p>
<p>As for school building assistance, Geiger said proposals for state bond issues could surface.</p>
<p>In fact, State Rep. Gene Krebs, R-Camdem, already has a bill to create a $1.1 billion bond program for school capital improvements that would be funded by revenues gained through changing the state's regulation on the pricing and distribution of beer and wine.</p>
<p>Other items on the legislative agenda include business tax reform and workers compensation reform, according to the aides.</p>
