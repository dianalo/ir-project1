<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin reiterated opposition to NATO's eastward expansion plans on Friday, two days before he was to return to the world stage and discuss the issue with French President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin, at talks with his top aide and foreign minister, had also dismissed opposition demands to amend the constitution to share out some of his vast powers because of his poor health.</p>
<p>Moscow opposes NATO's enlargement, saying it would threaten its security and cause new divisions in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia's position remains the same,&quot; Yastrzhembsky told a news conference after Yeltsin met Kremlin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov at his country residence.</p>
<p>The dispute is overshadowing Russia's ties with the West and relations could deteriorate sharply if no agreement is reached.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana made little progress when he had talks in Moscow with Primakov earlier this month.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said the dispute would be high on the agenda when Yeltsin, who turns 66 on Saturday, holds his first meeting with a Western leader since leaving hospital on January 20 following treatment for pneumonia.</p>
<p>He suggested Moscow saw some hope in the fact that France is sometimes at odds over NATO's development with the United States, a staunch proponent of the Western alliance's expansion plans.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky told reporters that the two leaders would &quot;compare approaches to the creation of a new security architecture in Europe. We have much in common on this respect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;NATO will also be discussed. As you know, the position of France differs somewhat from that of Washington and Bonn.&quot;</p>
<p>Paris opposes any Russian veto on European security, but an official in Paris told Reuters: &quot;We will plead Russia's case in NATO.&quot;</p>
<p>The official said Paris supported Moscow's demands for a binding charter on Russia-NATO relations and felt the United States was still trying to fob off the Russians with a few, non-binding pledges. Washington and most NATO allies oppose a legally-binding accord requiring parliamentary ratification.</p>
<p>Chirac hopes NATO can work out a deal with Russia before NATO holds a summit in Madrid in July, at which it is expected to issue invitations to some eastern European countries.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, under pressure from opponents who suggest he is unfit to rule, has made only three visits to the Kremlin since he left hospital.</p>
<p>Brief footage of him on television has done little to ease doubts over his health following two heart attacks in 1995 and a heart bypass operation on November 5.</p>
<p>He has met only one Western leader since his heart operation, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on January 4.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's talks with Chubais concentrated on domestic issues. Yastrzhembsky gave no details of the discussions about Chechnya, where the region's new president has pledged to push ahead with demands for independence.</p>
<p>But he said Yeltsin had dismissed demands by opposition politicians to amend the constitution which was agreed little over three years ago and gives him vast powers.</p>
