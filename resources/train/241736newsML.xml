<p>Hong Kong has said it will soon participate in a World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement that should help increase the competitiveness of its domestic goods, the government said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
<p>The announcement follows unanimous agreement by signatories of the pact on December 5 to accept Hong Kong into the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, the statement said.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, each signatory is obliged to treat products, services and suppliers of other signatories in public procurement as if they were of domestic origin, it said.</p>
<p>The agreement stipulates detailed rules on tendering, technical specifications and challenge procedures, aiming to ensure foreign products and suppliers compete on a level playing field with domestic products and suppliers for contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased that Hong Kong can become a party to the agreement. This will provide greater opportunities for our exporters and suppliers to tap into overseas government procurement markets,&quot; a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>The agreement groups Canada, the twelve member states of the European Community, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Aruba island off Venezuela, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States.</p>
