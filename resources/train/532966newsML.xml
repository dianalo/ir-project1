<p>Britain's ruling Conservatives are slipping further behind opposition Labour with just eight days to go until election day, while third-placed Liberal Democrats are notching up support, the country's leading political experts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Labour maintained its strong lead and the average prediction from the experts was that it would win an overall majority of 82 seats, up from the 79 seats predicted on average in last week's survey.</p>
<p>Yet in Britain's longest and arguably dirtiest campaign, some members of the panel said electors were getting fed up with the two main parties and said both the Labour and Conservative parties could be approaching the upper limit of their support.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole campaign has been going on for too long. It's not that people are excited by Labour, but more that they are sick of the Conservatives,&quot; said Neil Carter, lecturer in politics at York University.</p>
<p>In this penultimate Reuters survey of election experts, carried out on April 21 and 22, the 20-strong panel predicted on average that Labour would get 44 percent of the support on May 1, nine points ahead of the Conservatives with 35 percent.</p>
<p>In terms of the number of seats each party was expected to win, Labour was unchanged at 370 seats while the Conservatives dropped three seats to 236.</p>
<p>But this should cheer the Liberal Democrats. The panel saw them taking 26 seats and 16 percent of the support, up from 24 seats and 15 percent last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The Liberals attract the votes of those who want to vote but dont feel happy about the other parties,&quot; said Eric Shaw of the University of Stirling.</p>
<p>Robert Worcester, chairman of polling organisation MORI agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;People who vote Liberal will be getting a double vote. It will kick the Conservative government out and reduce the Labour majority,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The nine-point Labour lead predicted by the panel is still well below the stubborn gap of between 14 and 19 percentage points seen in most recent public opinion polls, a margin which the experts believe will narrow in the final days of the campaign.</p>
<p>But the Conservatives are doing little to help themselves. Ructions over Europe have continued to divide the party, while reports of plotting by senior ministers to oust John Major as party leader have detracted from the main issues.</p>
<p>But the question of which party is best able to defend Britain's interests in Europe may not have such an impact on the electorate on polling day.</p>
<p>&quot;People are focusing a bit more on Europe but the election will not be won on the European battlefield. It will be won on domestic issues,&quot; said Ben Pimlott of London's Birckbeck College.</p>
<p>Many of the panel now feel that Tony Blair's Labour party just have to hang on and not drop any clangers in order to romp home with a substantial majority.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has got a three-nil lead with 10 minutes to go. All it needs to do is keep possession,&quot; said Michael Thrasher, political scientist at the University of Plymouth.</p>
