<title>UK: Sotheby's probes smuggling allegations.</title>

<p>British auctioneers Sotheby's said on Thursday it had suspended some employees after allegations that Italian art treasures had been smuggled to London.</p>
<p>The managing director of Sotheby's Europe, George Bailey, told Britain's Press Association news agency he could not condone actions against the law or the firm's strict rules.</p>
<p>But he was strongly critical of the way the allegations had been made in an investigative television programme which used a hidden camera.</p>
<p>Bailey said he would make no final decision until he had seen the programme and made further investigations.</p>
<p>&quot;If any Sotheby's employees have behaved illegally, as they may or may not have done, I will take the necessary action. I take my pride in our reputation, as my staff do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The programme is due to be screened on Britain's Channel 4 television on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Sotheby's issued a statement deploring the methods used for the investigation, which it said had deliberately enticed employees into breaching its strict procedures.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, rules may have been broken and the staff concerned have been suspended pending a fuller investigation,&quot; said the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Such behaviour, if proven, does not represent the company's practices, nor will it be condoned by the company's management.&quot;</p>
