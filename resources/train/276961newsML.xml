<title>PHILIPPINES: Philippine stock exchange to go scripless on Jan 9.</title>

<p>The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is planning to implement scripless trading on January 9 next year, PSE President Vitaliano Nanagas told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The first issue to be converted on January 9 will be Jollibee Food Corp,&quot; said Nanagas.</p>
<p>By the end of February, the exchange intends to have ten issues converted into the scripless system, he said.</p>
<p>The new system, operating through a computerised central depository that would keep tab of share trades, is designed to minimise opportunities for fraud and speed up stock transfers.</p>
<p>The central clearing and settlement project should have started operations in April but it was delayed by the need to put a legal and regulatory framework in place to address risks such as a default by a broker.</p>
<p>Nanagas said the board is scheduled to discuss later in the day the charges to be imposed by the Philippine Central Depository Inc (PCDI) and the Securities Clearing Corp of the Philippines (SCCP), the two private companies that have been formed to undertake the clearing and settlements.</p>
<p>The PCDI will oversee the process of clearing and settlements, while the SCCP will handle the liquidity and brokers' guarantee fund.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the PSE denied a newspaper report of an ongoing probe on at least three listed companies concerning possible stock market manipulation and insider trading.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not authorised any investigation. Maybe our people are looking at something and that's very preliminary,&quot; Nanagas told Reuters.</p>
