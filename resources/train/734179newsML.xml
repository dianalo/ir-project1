<headline>Doubt cast ECNZ split will lower NZ power prices.</headline>

<p>Electricity Corp of New Zealand is to be further split in a plan designed to inject more competition into the electricity market and lower power prices.</p>
<p>But some industry players said on Wednesday they were dubious it will work, and Energy Minister Max Bradford has concerns the open market regime is not yet delivering lower prices to consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;If you split it up it will produce more competition but it won't necessarily produce lower prices for consumers,&quot; said an ECNZ source who declined to be identified.  </p>
<p>&quot;A split of ECNZ on its own is unlikely to produce that because the intermediaries, the people like TransAlta, Mercury, PowerCo, SouthPower, all those power companies, why would they pass on lower wholesale prices to consumers?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you own a company like that you just drop that windfall profit into your back pocket.&quot;</p>
<p>But Bradford said: &quot;Unless the wholesale price of electricity comes down as a first step then consumers are not going to get the benefit at all.&quot;</p>
<p>He told Reuters the plan to split state-owned generator ECNZ for a second time was part of an overall package.  </p>
<p>As well, he is considering forcing power distribution companies to disclose more information of separate line, energy and metering charges and he is even considering making the companies split those businesses into separate firms.</p>
<p>He is also pinning his hopes on rapidly developing metering technology which would allow consumers to compare prices and switch from one supplier to another.</p>
<p>&quot;You should look at the process we are involved in as a multi-stage exercise. Splitting ECNZ is one component of it to get more competition at the generation end which in turn will allow the wholesale market to work more effectively,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Bradford said he had no desire to transfer a monopoly in state generation to monopolies among the regional distribution power companies but there had been &quot;regrettable&quot; developments.</p>
<p>&quot;What I have to do as minister of energy is to ensure that the benefits of the drop in wholesale prices are not captured by the power companies and their shareholders through anti-competitive practices.&quot;</p>
<p>David Russell, head of the Consumers Institute, said big claims were made of the split of one third of ECNZ'S assets into Contact Energy in 1995 but the reality was different.  </p>
<p>&quot;Average retail prices have risen between 1995 and 1996 at 6.1 percent while the wholesale price over that period has dropped by 3.6 percent,&quot; Russell said.</p>
<p>That trend has continued. In the three months to the end of June, consumer prices rose by 2.1 percent while wholesale prices rose by 0.9 percent.</p>
<p>The ECNZ source said one way to ginger up competition would be to allow ECNZ and its &quot;babies&quot; to enter the retail market.  </p>
<p>&quot;It would be a way of injecting new blood and new thinking into the retail end of the market. At present, it's a cosy old-boys' club. No one wants to rock the boat because all the established players have got a stake in it.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't really want to open up to competition. They don't want to go aggressively into someone else's area for fear of encouraging someone to come aggressively into their area.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the generators had every incentive to get on with the job at the retail level and compete hard.  </p>
<p>Bradford said he had no intention of allowing ECNZ into the retail market while it had market dominance, but he might consider that as its dominance declined in a few years' time.</p>
<p>He threatened distributors with the Commerce Act if they indulged in anti-competitive behaviour.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is determined to ensure that the retail power companies aren't in a position to block the development of proper competition,&quot; he said.</p>
