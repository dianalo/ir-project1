<p>In keeping with the measured campaign that swept him to power, Tony Blair scorns the suggestion of grandiose early initiatives to mark his arrival as Labour's first prime minister in 18 years.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not a great believer in a dazzling hundred first days which then disappears up in smoke,&quot; he told The Times last week.</p>
<p>But, he told the paper, there was something improbable about being a radical leader of the Labour party and a cautious prime minister: &quot;I won't be. I'll be a radical prime minister.&quot;</p>
<p>Blair says his ambitions to improve British education will be the best test of whether he succeeds in being radical.</p>
<p>When Queen Elizabeth on May 14 reads out Blair's legislative programme, the centrepiece will be a flagship bill on education.</p>
<p>A &quot;white&quot; policy paper expected before the summer will set out its main thrust and, after consultation and extensive drafting, the bill will be put to parliament later in the year.</p>
<p>The stiffest early test of Blair's mettle will come in the foreign affairs arena, with three summits within a month of the Group of Seven industrial nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and, crucially, the European Union.</p>
<p>The EU gathering in Amsterdam in mid-June, to chart the future of the 15-nation bloc, played a big part in the election, with former prime minister John Major accusing Blair of being ready to surrender Britain's national veto in key policy areas.</p>
<p>Blair is committed to making a &quot;fresh start&quot; in Europe after years of what he saw as counter-productive blocking tactics by Major's ministers that left Britain without influence when it was needed, for example during the crisis over mad cow disease.</p>
<p>But he also has to show he can be a tough international negotiator. The right balance will be hard to strike, and Blair told BBC television he was already swotting hard for Amsterdam.</p>
<p>The new chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, will also have to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Even before Blair's cabinet has gathered for the first time, Brown is scheduled to meet Bank of England Governor Eddie George on May 7 to discuss whether to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>Brown, who was the soul of discretion on key economic questions during the campaign, must decide whether to accede to George's demand -- supported by many private economists -- for dearer money to stop the economy from overheating.</p>
<p>Brown will be centre stage again in July when Labour is expected to present an emergency budget to implement its proposed windfall tax on the excess profits of privatised utilities.</p>
<p>Labour, wary of legal challenges, has not yet specified which firms will be subject to the one-off tax, which will pay for a 3 billion pound ($4.88 billion) scheme to get 250,000 under-25s who have been unemployed for over six months off welfare and into work.</p>
<p>To some of Blair's supporters, the five basic commitments he has made on health, education, juvenile crime, youth unemployment and economic policy smack of minimalism.</p>
<p>Left-wingers also worry that Brown's promise to freeze income tax and stick to the Conservatives' tough public spending targets for the next two years will tie Labour's hands.</p>
<p>But one area where Blair is convinced Labour can make a big difference at little cost is in the constitutional field.</p>
<p>A short bill will be put through parliament before the summer recess to set the stage for referendums on a parliament for Scotland with tax-raising powers and an assembly for Wales with more modest powers.</p>
<p>With Conservatives determined to fight the proposals tooth and nail, claiming they would herald the break-up of the United Kingdom, a long hot political summer could be in prospect.</p>
