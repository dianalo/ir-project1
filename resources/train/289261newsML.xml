<p>An Egyptian business leader said during a visit to Israel on Monday that Egyptian executives would be more enthusiastic about dealing with the Jewish state once progress was made in Middle East peace efforts.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Kamel, chairman of the Kato group of companies, was invited to Israel by Benjamin Gaon, president and chief executive officer of Koor Industries, and was to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday.</p>
<p>His visit, a result of contacts with Gaon at November's Middle East and North Africa economic summit in Cairo, is being held against the backdrop of political tensions between Israel and Egypt.</p>
<p>&quot;All the Egyptian businessmen, as we see progress in the peace process...will enthusiastically do business,&quot; Kamel told Reuters in a telephone interview when asked whether other Egyptian executives were also keen to forge ties with Israel.</p>
<p>Kamel said he would not be signing any deals during his 24-hour visit.</p>
<p>&quot;This visit is really to get acquainted with all the possibilities of Koor Industries and also to have the opportunity to meet with the business community here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Kato group has interests in aviation, agriculture, tourism, property, insurance, banking and trade. Kamel also serves on a number of government authorities.</p>
<p>Gaon, joking that he wished the peace process could be privatised, told Reuters: &quot;I think that business people from both sides have found out that peace is too important to leave to the politicians. The politicians are paving the way for peace and we are cementing it.&quot;</p>
