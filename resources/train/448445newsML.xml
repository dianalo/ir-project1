<p>Taiwan stocks surged to yet another six-year high on Monday as fearless investors kept pumping money into the market, but analysts said newly triggered anti-speculation limits could slow the bulls' charge.</p>
<p>On Monday, the weighted index surged 135.11 points or 1.63 percent to close at its intra-day high of 8,426.42 on sizzling turnover of T$176.88 billion (US$6.4 billion).</p>
<p>The close surpassed the 8,291.31 finish on March 15 to mark the index's highest finish since 8,569.55 on May 15, 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's sharp gains show investors are confident the bull run will continue. It means very little to tell them where the peak is,&quot; said Joe Chiou, a Taiwan Securities Investment analyst who feels the index will rise further.</p>
<p>Taiwan's stock market already is one of the best performing markets in the world, having risen 23.5 percent in 1997 and 70.5 percent since a year ago, when rival China's intimidating war games and missile tests sent investors running for cover.</p>
<p>Some analysts, citing technical charts to question whether the long rise reflected fundamental equity value or speculation, said the bulls needed more time to consolidate the gains.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically it is time for a correction,&quot; said Ben Lee of Nomura Securities. &quot;It's not good for the index to remain at high levels for such a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>The market could enter a correction as early as Tuesday now that the index has passed 8,400 points -- triggering anti-speculation rules under which market regulators will tighten credit trading limits.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Stock Exchange said its margin-buying and short-selling ratios would be trimmed by 10 percentage points each to 40 percent and 50 percent.</p>
<p>To avoid excessive credit expansion at the time of sharp stock market rallies, the exchange has benchmarks to reduce credit trading limits when the index passes 6,000, 7,200, 8,400 point and 9,600 points, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The new credit trade limits will slow the liquidity-driven rally -- regardless of how bullish people feel,&quot; said Chen Han-chung, an analyst for Yungli Securities.</p>
<p>Other factors could come into play.</p>
<p>Analysts said the central bank's recent attempts to tighten liquidity could help cool Taiwan's stock fever.</p>
<p>Likely political tensions arising from a controversial March 22-27 visit by Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, would further add caution, they said.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama's planned visit was almost certain to spark angry protests from arch rival Beijing, which says the exiled Tibetan god-king and some of Taiwan's leaders are &quot;splittists&quot; seeking Tibet's and Taiwan's independence from communist China.</p>
<p>Chiou of Taiwan Securities Investment said there were, nevertheless, plenty of reasons to be optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is expected to recover. Corporate earnings are expected to rise. This is very different from what happened in 1990,&quot; Chiou said.</p>
<p>Chiou was referring to the Taiwan market's panic crash of 1990 when the index soared to an historic high of 12,495.34 points on February 10 -- then freefell 80 percent over the next eight months to bottom out at just 2,560.47 on October 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Even foreigners are optimistic about Taiwan's market now,&quot; Chiou said. &quot;Investors should be cautious, but they should not worry too much about the sharp gains.&quot;</p>
