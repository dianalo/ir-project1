<title>FRANCE: French blazes destroy forests near Marseille.</title>
<headline>French blazes destroy forests near Marseille.</headline>

<text>
<p>Firefighters battled blazes near the Mediterranean port of Marseille on Saturday that have destroyed about 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of forest and scrubland.</p>
<p>About 1,000 firefighters, backed by reinforcements from nearby regions and hampered by high winds, were trying to stifle three blazes that have burnt down several villas and forced the evacuation of about 1,000 people on the fringes of the city.</p>
<p>More than 150 people, many of them firefighters working through the night, have needed medical treatment for smoke inhalation. Seven were treated in hospital amid the worst fires to sweep the region in five years.</p>
<p>Four planes scooping up water from the Mediterranean to dump on the fires resumed work at dawn on Saturday, raising hopes that the fires could be brought under control before an expected rise in the wind later in the day.</p>
<p>Two extra fires broke out overnight, adding two more fronts to the original blaze that erupted on Friday in a rubbish dump near a pine forest in the Marseille suburb of Septemes-les-Vallons.</p>
