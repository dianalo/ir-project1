<p>The upper house of the Swiss parliament has approved a tightening of money laundering laws giving bankers a duty -- and not just a right -- to report financial transactions they suspect are tied to illegal drugs trade or other Mafia-style crimes.</p>
<p>&quot;Up to now there was no obligation to report suspicious transactions, only a right to report,&quot; a finance ministry official said.</p>
<p>The upper house late on Monday approved a proposal from the lower house with minor changes. The draft has now been returned to the lower house to iron out the differences and final passage is expected shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no substantial difference between the two proposals,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The new law conforms to international standards and marks another step in Switzerland's attempt to rid itself of the reputation for being a haven for the money laundering activities of corrupt politicians, dictators and drug smugglers.</p>
<p>In 1990 Switzerland outlawed money laundering and in 1994 it gave bankers the right to breach the country's legendary banking secrecy laws and report suspicious transactions to authorities.</p>
<p>Under the new law, bankers who do not report suspicious transactions can face fines up to 200,000 Swiss francs ($138,000).</p>
<p>The law has also been broadened in its scope and now covers all areas of the financial sector, such as banks, life insurers, investment funds and securities firms.</p>
<p>The law also gives the police the power to freeze suspicious assets pending an investigation, and requires that money managers keep a paper trail on financial transactions.</p>
<p>One of the issues under debate is the difference between negligent and deliberate behaviour by bankers.</p>
<p>The lower house's proposal did not distinguish between bankers being negligent in their reporting and bankers deliberately not reporting suspicious transactions.</p>
<p>Finance minister Kaspar Villiger fears a flood of insignificant reports from fearful bank employees if negligence can be fined, Swiss News Agency (SDA) said.</p>
