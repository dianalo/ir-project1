<p>The Swedish central bank on Thursday cut its deposit and lending rates by half a percentage point, prompting analysts to predict that low inflation could pave the way for further easing of the key repo rate.</p>
<p>The deposit and lending rates, which mark the floor and ceiling of the central bank's interest rate corridor, now stand at 3.75 percent and 5.25 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The move was expected after the repo rate, the central rate in Sweden's three-tier system and key tool for controlling money market liquidity, was cut 0.25 points last week to 4.35 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a clear signal that the Riksbank intends to continue to cut the repo rate. Fundamentals remain extremely supportive, highlighted by the current deflationary conditions,&quot; PaineWebber economist James McKay said.</p>
<p>Analysts continued to lower their forecasts for the repo rate, with most saying they now saw it hitting bottom at about 3.75 percent in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>The Riksbank said low inflation, and good prospects that prices rises would remain subdued, was behind the lowering of the corridor, last moved on October 24.</p>
<p>In October the CPI index was unchanged from September to give a minus 0.1 percent year-on-year rate, the first time for 37 years that prices fell in Sweden.</p>
<p>&quot;The conditions for inflation in line with the inflation target are still considered to be good,&quot; the Riksbank said.</p>
<p>The government has set an inflation target of two percent with flexibility of one percentage point either way.</p>
<p>Since the start of the year the Riksbank has pursued an aggressive monetary policy, cutting the repo rate 24 times from a starting level of 8.91 percent.</p>
<p>Another lowering of the repo rate by 0.20 to 0.25 percentage points is expected on December 17 when the Riksbank sets a reverse repurchase operation that will run for three weeks to cover the holiday period.</p>
<p>On the same day the Riksbank will release its last inflation report for the year.</p>
<p>&quot;December 17 is fully discounted by the market: another 20-25 basis points, and that will go into 1997,&quot; said Swedbank economist Peter Granquist in an interview with Reuters Financial Television (RFTV).</p>
<p>A Riksbank commissioned survey by economic research institute Prospera AB cheered markets on Wednesday when it showed Swedish business sector expectations for inflation had been significantly reduced since September to an alltime low.</p>
<p>Only more good news was expected in the December 17 report.</p>
<p>&quot;They are going to say that the inflation outlook is going to be even better than the quite optimistic view they had at the time of the last report. It means room for more repo rate cuts,&quot; Nordbanken economist Olle Djerf said.</p>
<p>Granquist said this, combined with a tight fiscal policy, supported a short-term view that more repo rate cuts were likely. He saw the rate bottoming at 3.75 percent sometime in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>&quot;But in the long-run, KI (the Swedish government economic think-tank) do have very good GDP forecasts and we are going to see an acceleration in the economy, so in the long run we shouldn't be that confident.&quot;</p>
