<p>Philips Electronics NV is set to report sharply lower 1996 net profit from normal operations next Thursday and could face a net loss for the year as restructuring charges bite, analysts say.</p>
<p>Forecasts for net profit from normal operations in the fourth quarter mainly range from 387 million guilders ($207.7 million) to 616 million against a previous 1.02 billion. For the year analysts expect between 1.09 billion and 1.5 billion, sharply down from the 1995 net from normal operations of 2.68 billion guilders.</p>
<p>And if Philips adds to the 1.4 billion of restructuring charges already expected, a net loss could be booked.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Philips to pay a dividend, although it should be much lower than the 1.60 per share paid for 1995.</p>
<p>Passing on the dividend for the first time since 1992, the last time it had a net loss, is seen unlikely as the firm strives to demonstrate its intent to maximise shareholder value.</p>
<p>&quot;The dividend will be down to a guilder. We see a net profit after extraordinaries, which is positive. Probably some analysts will not have that,&quot; said Steven Vrolijk of ING Barings.</p>
<p>&quot;That makes it difficult to pay a dividend. But then Philips is looking to shareholder value. When there is no dividend clients will not be impressed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Philips is continuing to struggle with flat markets and fierce price erosion, with most of its units seen turning in lacklustre performances over the year.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look across the different divisions they're still having problems in consumer electronics. Volume is slightly up but prices are still under pressure,&quot; said Paul van Doorn of Kempen and Co.</p>
<p>&quot;In semiconductors it showed up in the third quarter that prices were still under pressure and they didn't really show any improvement in the fourth quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you take the figures for (full-year) net profit excluding extraordinary items I have 1.2 billion guilders (vs 2.68 billion). If you include all the extraordinaries it's a loss of 245 million guilders (vs profit of 2.5 billion),&quot; said Peter Wortel, head of research at Delta Lloyd Bank.</p>
<p>Vrolijk of ING is looking for net from normal operations over the year of 1.55 billion guilders, while net profit after extraordinaries would be slashed back to 259 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a difficult story, if the extraordinary is higher then the company is in fact facing a bottom line loss,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many things happening in the company, so many things closing down it's extremely difficult to tell what the exact figure will be,&quot; said Vrolijk.</p>
<p>Philips had booked a net 445 million guilders of extraordinary charges for restructuring by the nine months stage and said then that it would take another charge of around one billion guilders before tax in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Some analysts anticipate the total restructuring bill could be significantly higher than 1.4 billion for the year, as Philips gets on with its plans to close down underperformers and tighten management practices.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect Philips will clean the house in 1996 and will try to move on in 1997 and 1998 with a clean sheet,&quot; said one who did not wish to be named.</p>
<p>Analysts said markets were pretty much reconciled to the stream of lower earnings coming out of Eindhoven and were now waiting for news of how Cor Boonstra, who took over as chairman last October, was going to turn the company around.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless we get something that makes you think it's so much worse than you could have imagined... these figures aren't all that important,&quot; said Angela Dean of Morgan Stanley in London.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking forwards now, not backwards, this is a major potential restructuring story because 1996 has been a terrible year for them. We all knew it was terrible six months ago. Can this new guy sort it out? That's the next question and I don't think the fourth quarter's going to tell you very much about that,&quot; she said. -- Keiron Henderson, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000 ($ = 1.863 Dutch Guilders)</p>
