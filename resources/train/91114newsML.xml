<headline>PLO says Washington summit in crisis.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Senior PLO officials said on Wednesday the Palestinians had rejected Israeli demands at a Washinton summit on ending violence that has claimed 57 Palestinian and 15 Israeli lives.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a crisis in Washington because of Israeli demands that have been rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu asked for a meeting with Arafat. Arafat has rejected. The Americans are intervening and mediating to contain the crisis,&quot; one well-informed Palestine Liberation Organisation official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The official said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had demanded the Palestinian Authority try police who had fired on Israeli soldiers during the violence last week and that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat reduce the size of his police force. He said Palestinians rejected the demands.</p>
<p>He said Netanyahu had turned down demands he set a date for a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron and for resumption of final status peace talks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had also refused to close a tunnel in Jerusalem the opening of which on September 24 sparked the clashes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americans have asked the Israelis to close the tunnel. Netanyahu refused. The Palestinian side is studying issuing a statement to announce the failure of the summit but the Americans are intervening to stop them,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, on the sidelines in Washington in place of President Hosni Mubarak who is boycotting the summit, told Israel Channel One Television the Palestinians and Arabs had given Netanyahu time to formulate policy and he had abused it.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, when Mr Netanyahu was in Cairo and asked for time...that was okay with us and the other Arabs. But the fact was that he used that time to change the realities on the ground so it is very delicate.</p>
<p>&quot;But Mr Arafat I'm sure will accept what the Palestinian people and the Arab people would agree, that yes, this means progress,&quot; Moussa said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu ousted Israel's previous centre-left government in May elections. Since taking office in June he has yet to redeploy in Hebron as agreed in a signed accord by the other government with the PLO and has lifted a freeze on building for Jews in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
