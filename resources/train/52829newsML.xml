<title>JAPAN: Okinawa governor to relent on U.S. bases - officials.</title>

<p>Okinawa's governor is expected to relent on Friday and agree to renew leases for U.S. military bases on the island, ending a bitter standoff with the central government in Tokyo, local officials in Okinawa said.</p>
<p>&quot;I will make a final decision today,&quot; Governor Masahide Ota told reporters in Naha, the prefecture's capital.</p>
<p>The governor won a promise from Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto this week that Okinawa would get special funds in the national budget to improve the economy of the prefecture, the poorest in Japan with average income half the level of Tokyo's.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe Governor Ota is making utmost efforts to persuade Okinawans (to back his plan),&quot; top government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting (for his decision) with breathless interest,&quot; he told a regular news conference on Friday.</p>
<p>Following the rape last year of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen, a case that ignited renewed protests against the presence of the U.S. military on the island, Ota refused to sign orders to renew leases for the facilities.</p>
<p>In a further incident, Okinawa police said on Friday two U.S. servicemen were being held by U.S. authorities on suspicion of assaulting and robbing a female bar owner.</p>
<p>U.S. military authorities identified the two suspects as Jeremy Wright and Brian Bergen, both Marine corporals stationed at Camp Hansen in Okinawa.</p>
<p>The two allegedly entered a bar owned by Toshiko Gakiya, 56, on Wednesday and after having had a few drinks, assaulted her and stole her purse which contained 7,000 yen ($63), an Okinawa prefectural police spokesman said.</p>
<p>The leases, held by some 3,000 landowners opposed to the bases, expire next May, posing a potential threat to U.S. use of the facilities and complicating U.S.-Japan security ties.</p>
<p>The subtropical island, some 1,000 km (625 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is home to three-quarters of the U.S. military facilities in Japan and hosts about half of the 47,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in the country, although it constitutes less than one percent of Japan's total land area.</p>
<p>Okinawans have long complained about the heavy concentration of U.S. bases on the island.</p>
<p>In a visit to Tokyo in April, President Bill Clinton announced base consolidations on the island that cut by about 20 percent the area they occupy.</p>
<p>In a referendum last Sunday, Okinawans voted overwhelmingly to call for a reduction in the U.S. military presence on the island, and Ota is pushing for closure of all bases by 2015.</p>
<p>Late last month, the 15-member Grand Bench of Japan's Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Okinawa must appropriate land for U.S. military bases, rejecting an appeal by Ota that the military presence was unconstitutional.</p>
