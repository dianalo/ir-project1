<p>NATO decided on Monday that an alliance-led force of between 25,000 and 30,000 troops should stay in Bosnia next year to cement the country's fragile peace.</p>
<p>Ambassadors from the 16 member nations ordered their military commanders to prepare for the reduced force to remain after the mandate of the once 60,000-strong NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) ends on December 20.</p>
<p>The final go-ahead for the follow-on force will be given early in December, when NATO foreign and defence ministers meet in Brussels and after the U.N. Security Council has agreed a resolution approving it.</p>
<p>&quot;The North Atlantic Council (the NATO ambassadors) today directed detailed contingency planning for a multi-national Stabilisation Force, significantly reduced in size, to replace IFOR,&quot; a NATO spokesman said.</p>
<p>The move followed the announcement on Friday by President Bill Clinton that Washington was prepared to commit 8,500 troops to a new force to remain in Bosnia until June 1998 at the latest.</p>
<p>NATO officials said the U.S. ambassador to the alliance had outlined proposals on the mandate for the Stabilisation Force, informally called SFOR, including the length of time it would remain and what it would do.</p>
<p>&quot;We need some more days to fine-tune the decision,&quot; a NATO diplomat said.</p>
<p>NATO ambassadors will return to the issues of time and task on Wednesday, after which U.S. General George Joulwan, the supreme allied commander Europe, will draft a military plan to be presented at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Key NATO countries have different views of how long the new force should remain in Bosnia. Germany wants one year, France as many as two and the United States one-and-a-half, the diplomat said.</p>
<p>A NATO official said all countries which had not previously committed themselves to providing troops for the new force did so at Monday's meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;What we have is an agreement that all 16 nations are prepared to support a follow-on force...and to contribute in some way,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Most countries had not said exactly what they were prepared to provide, the official said, but Norway had offered one battalion and Britain had said its force would be &quot;substantial&quot;.</p>
<p>Germany has said it is prepared to send 3,000 soldiers, the first use of German troops in a potential combat role outside the NATO area since the end of World War Two. France is said to be prepared to commit around 2,500 troops.</p>
<p>A NATO official said the SFOR troops would be deployed in much the same way IFOR was, with the United States based in Tuzla, Britain in Vitez and France, with German troops under its command, in Sarajevo.</p>
<p>The new SFOR is expected to take more of a role in supporting civilian reconstruction, notably municipal elections some time next year.</p>
<p>IFOR was primarily concerned with ensuring that the warring parties adhered to the Dayton peace accord.</p>
