<p>School uniforms are gathering dust in Mohammad al-Turkmany's clothing shop in Gaza just a week before Palestinian children return to class.</p>
<p>In past years, the merchandise would have been sold out by now. This year, a closure Israel clamped on Gaza and the West Bank after a July 30 double suicide bombing in Jerusalem has hit Palestinian parents hard.</p>
<p>&quot;We lowered prices to help people buy these uniforms but they are going slowly,&quot; Turkmany said about business over the weekend.</p>
<p>Even in the economically depressed Gaza Strip, parents usually scrape together enough money to send their children back to school with two new uniforms. It's a matter of pride, Palestinians say.</p>
<p>&quot;The new school year is at the door and I don't have a penny in my pocket,&quot; said Abdel Aziz al-Ruzzy, a 35-year-old with five school-aged children. He used to earn 150 ($42.5) shekels a day working in building maintenance in Israel.</p>
<p>Israel argues Palestinians must learn a lesson that a price must be paid for attacks in its marketplaces and on its buses. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says restrictions will remain in effect until Palestinian President Yasser Arafat cracks down on Moslem militants.</p>
<p>Palestinians call the Israeli measures collective punishment aimed at humiliating them.</p>
<p>&quot;This closure makes them feel embarrassed in front of their children,&quot; said Ghaleb al-Shurafa, who sells school uniforms in Gaza City's main shopping centre.</p>
<p>Some 300,000 Palestinian children are expected to attend United Nations, Palestinian Authority and private schools when the new school year begins on August 23.</p>
<p>Some parents are scrambling for loans to meet their children's demands for new clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;No one wants to lend me money and my children will have to go in their old uniforms for some time,&quot; added Nayef Musabeh, 40, who has five children and took home 2,000 shekels a month from a construction job in Israel. &quot;There is no work in Gaza.&quot;</p>
<p>Merchants said it costs an average 100 shekels to outfit a Gazan schoolchild.</p>
<p>&quot;I took a $1,400 bank loan to buy the children new clothes and pay the university fees for my eldest son,&quot; said Fuad Daher, a 40-year-old father of seven. He used to work in the southern Israeli town of Beersheba, earning 100 shekels a day.</p>
<p>Fathiya Ghali, 45, haggled with a shopowner over the price of trousers for her four children, finally deciding she could afford to buy only two pairs.</p>
<p>&quot;With this Netanyahu, every evil is expectable,&quot; she said with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.53 shekels)</p>
