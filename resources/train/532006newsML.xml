<p>Trading in the Singapore rubber market was dominated on Wednesday by shortcovering for RSS3 and RSS1 grade rubber while the business kept a wary eye on the strike in Goodyear Tire, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some shortcovering by European buyers for RSS1 and RSS3, but other people are still very careful because of the Goodyear strike,&quot; a trader said. Some deals were also concluded for forward shipments of TSR20 rubber.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the trade was watching for any sign that Goodyear, whose annual consumption of rubber reaches about 300,000 tonnes, may defer some shipments because of the strike. &quot;I heard from New York they will begin defering shipments of 2,000 tonnes although there were no details,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Traders said major consumers in the Singapore rubber trade were not seen in the market. &quot;I don't think I've seen the majors doing anything today,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Offer prices for SIR20 rubber are tipped to dip further to 45 U.S. cents a lb after being quoted around 46-47 cents this morning largely because of Goodyear's strike, dealers said.</p>
