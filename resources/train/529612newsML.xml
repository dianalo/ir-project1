<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet on Tuesday approved draft legislation which would carry out the lion's share of tax cuts planned by Finance Minister Theo Waigel, a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>Waigel's 1999 tax bill would sharply reduce income and corporate taxes in the second phase of a package which would cut the total German tax burden by around 30 billion marks.</p>
<p>The bill would slash the bottom rate of income tax to 15 percent from 26 percent, and set a new top rate of 39 percent, down from 53 percent.</p>
<p>It would also implement the second phase of corporate tax cuts which would lower the main rate to 35 percent from 47 percent now.</p>
<p>Legislation which would initiate cuts in corporate taxes in 1998 and cut the so-called solidarity surcharge, a levy to aid ex-communist east Germany, has already had its first reading in the Bundestag lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Kohl will lead a government team into talks on Wednesday with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to try and find a compromise on tax reforms to avert deadlock in parliament, where the SPD can block tax measures in the upper house.</p>
<p>Kohl wrote in an open letter on Monday to SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine that the talks would be pointless if the SPD does not fundamentally agree to a cut in tax rates.</p>
<p>The SPD has supported cutting bottom rate income tax and corporate tax, but has opposed a big drop in top-rate income tax. It has also made its acceptance of the coalition tax reforms conditional on cuts in social insurance charges.</p>
