<text>
<p>A bitter 21-month internal crisis within English third division club Brighton appeared to be resolved on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The dispute, which has sparked several angry pitch invasions at the Goldstone ground, was settled by independent negotiators with the decision to build a new 15,000-seat stadium.</p>
<p>The bottom-of-the-table club, who have to move from their ground at the end of the season, also plan to spend two million pounds ($3.3 million) on strengthening their player reserves.</p>
<p>Local businessman Dick Knight was named the club's new chairman, replacing Dick Archer.</p>
<p>Archer, the focus of much of the fans' ire, has agreed to stay away from Brighton's final game at the Goldstone ground on Saturday.</p>
