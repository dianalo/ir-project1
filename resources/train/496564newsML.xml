<p>The Brazilian government will expand as of Thursday the list of goods eligible for special Proex export financing, said Paulo Jobim, executive secretary of the Industry and Commerce Ministry.</p>
<p>Jobim said that a decree to be published Thursday would expand the list to 463 groups of products from 358 groups.</p>
<p>In addition, the two Proex credit lines -- one for pure financing and the other used to subsidise interest rate differentials between Brazil and abroad -- will be merged and minimum repayment terms cut to 12 months from 18 months.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Proex lines have been underused. Many firms don't know how to get access. We want to increase the number of takers, especially among small firms,&quot; Jobim told reporters.</p>
<p>The $300 million in credit for financing and $700 million for so-called interest rate &quot;equalization&quot; will now be available to all product groups that qualify.</p>
<p>Previously, financing and equilization were restricted to capital goods and durable consumer goods.  </p>
<p>According to Helio Mauro Franca, director of the foreign trade policy department, everything but main export commodities such as soybean, cocoa and iron ore will now be covered.</p>
<p>Mauro and Jobim said the aim in particular was to target small firms manufacturing such products as shoes and fresh fruit.</p>
<p>The $1.0 billion is already budgeted. Proex funds are administered by federal Banco do Brasil.</p>
