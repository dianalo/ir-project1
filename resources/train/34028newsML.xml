<p>Non-ferrous metal prices dived across-the-board on Thursday on the London Metal Exchange (LME) as a bear raid on copper hit sentiment throughout the sector.</p>
<p>The flagship copper contract crashed though successive important support levels as investment funds baled out and the liquidation triggered sell-stops and some panic selling.</p>
<p>The other metals, previously immune to copper's gyrations, also tumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;It's madness. Copper is being sold off and everybody is looking to play it from the short side,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Copper's volatility was highlighted by Thursday's range, with prices hitting an early peak of $2,037 a tonne. Later the three months price crashed to $1,935 before settling nervously around $1,950.</p>
<p>On Wednesday prices ended around $2,020. Copper had then seemed to have settled into a new slightly higher range after languishing below $2,000 since the Sumitomo Corp scandal in mid-June.</p>
<p>Traders said the volatility was a factor of technical trading in this volume as physical trade in copper has been quiet and the Chinese, who are major players, were sitting on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Aluminium, previously comfortable above $1,500, slipped to $1,486 per tonne at one stage from Wednesday's close of $1,508. Nickel slumped below $7,500 to hit $7,420, a loss of $130 on the day.</p>
<p>U.S. hostilities against Iraq again left commodity markets outside the petroleum sector unmoved.</p>
<p>Gold firmed slightly but was still capped by disappointment that it had failed to rally on the Iraq news.</p>
<p>Benchmark Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) wheat futures eased to $4.42-1/2 from a recent range around $4.50 a bushel.Coffee and cocoa were also just easier. Some key commodity prices at 1600 GMT</p>
