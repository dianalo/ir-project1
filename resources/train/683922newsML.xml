<p>European telecoms joint venture Unisource said on Tuesday its 1996 losses increased, mainly due to non-recurring expansion costs, and that it was on track to break even by 2000.</p>
<p>Unisource, which groups Koninklijke PTT Nederland, Telia of Sweden and Swiss Telecom said its losses increased in 1996 to 375.4 million guilders from 319.7 million in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now on the upward track to break-even,&quot; Unisource finance director Jan de Vries said in a statement. &quot;The company expects a ten billion guilder revenue by the turn of the century, by which time break-even will be reached,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Unisource said net revenues rose 85 percent to 2.43 billion guilders, which the group said was helped by the acquisition of business telecoms and data transmission company Unisource Espana from former partner Telefonica of Spain.</p>
<p>Growth in home country markets and other European target markets such as Belgium, France, Germany and Italy also contributed to the increase in revenues.</p>
<p>Losses deepened as the group, established in 1992, continued with &quot;significant&quot; investments, particularly in the further expansion of its international backbone network and in costs related to new communications services in Europe, it said.  </p>
<p>Unisource said a significant part of the costs it had were non-recurring, although costs were only offset to a limited extent by an increase in revenue from international voice communications, owing to the long sales cycle of the segment.</p>
<p>Group chief executive Paul Smits said in the statement Unisource was heading for substantial revenue growth in 1997 and the company aimed to shorten the time needed to bring new services to market and cut sales cycle times.</p>
<p>&quot;In every respect Unisource has now ended its formation phase and is now embarked on expansion,&quot; he said.</p>
