<p>China has warned entrepreneurs not to profit from political issues such as World War Two or the return of Hong Kong to mainland rule, the China Industrial and Commercial News said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The unauthorised use of political issues by some units and individuals to engage in commercial activities for personal profit is quite serious,&quot; the newspaper quoted a circular by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce as saying.</p>
<p>Many companies had produced unauthorised souvenirs to mark the July 1 handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule while others had sold toy models of Japanese warships used to attack China during World War Two, the circular said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some have stolen the names of... national leaders to use in advertisements or have used shoddy goods to cheat consumers,&quot; the circular said.</p>
<p>Any merchandise relating to major political or historical events, or which used images of Communist Party or national leaders, would have to be approved by the government.</p>
<p>Violators would be strictly punished.</p>
<p>The ruling Communist Party tries to keep a monopoly on news and goods relating to major events and personages, often using them to stir up patriotic sentiment and bolster its position.</p>
