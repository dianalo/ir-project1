<p>Big gains by the leftist opposition in elections held in Mexico's Guerrero state last weekend should stem rising political violence and diminish the appeal of armed rebels, Gov Angel Aguirre said.</p>
<p>Aguirre told foreign correspondents in an interview on Monday he was happy with the vote on Sunday, despite losses by his ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).  </p>
<p>The PRD for the first time won several important municipalities, including the state's second city of Iguala. Although final results were not due until Wednesday, the leftist party also appeared headed to victory in at least 20 other towns -- a big jump from the seven it currently holds.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very happy. When opposition leaders say they had only minor complaints with the election, that is worth more than anything we can say,&quot; Aguirre said.</p>
<p>He said the lack of complaints would also make the public less sympathetic to rebels of the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), which first appeared in Guerrero in June calling for the overthrow of the government.  </p>
<p>&quot;These elections will have to make the EPR think, because their position is that clean elections here are not possible,&quot; the governor said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the PRD, which is a political group that is respected by the guerrillas, says they got a fair deal in the election, that should make them think long and hard, think that violence is not the answer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Army troops have resumed their counter-insurgency operations after suspending them during the voting, Aguirre said.</p>
<p>The governor said he was willing to negotiate peace with the EPR if they so desired.</p>
<p>He said greater political participation by the PRD should ease tensions that have frequently led to violent clashes between police and the party's supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I want them to get involved in the political process. In matters of budget, for example, it's a lot less easy to complain when they know just how little money there is for projects,&quot; Aguirre said.</p>
