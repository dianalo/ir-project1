<title>UK: UK wool industry demands better trade protection.</title>
<headline>UK wool industry demands better trade protection.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Representatives of the UK wool textile industry have called for the government to defend it from a threatened invasion of cheap imports after European Union (EU) trade barriers are lifted in 1998.</p>
<p>The European Commission is currently finalising its proposals for the second of a three-phase integration of textiles and clothing into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), due for completion in 2005.</p>
<p>A United Nations trade body estimated that imports of Asian textiles into Europe will treble as a result.</p>
<p>But UK wool industry sources said it would devastate the wool trade and have a strong impact on regional economies.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Peacock, chairman of the parliamentary All Party Wool Textile Group, requested that the government &quot;press the European Commission to remove wool cloth from the list of products to be re-integrated&quot; into GATT.</p>
<p>She made the request in a letter sent to the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Thursday and included a document detailing views of the wool textile trade whose interests the All Party group was set up to represent.</p>
<p>The document refuted the Commission's claims to have taken into account &quot;the sensitivity of the product....and its regional impact both in industrial and employment terms&quot;.</p>
<p>The effect on the economy in West Yorkshire -- the heartland of UK wool processing -- would be &quot;significant&quot;, it said.</p>
<p>Unofficial figures put the number employed in the industry there as around 22,000.</p>
<p>&quot;The wool textile industries in India and China are expanding rapidly and if the USA retains its existing protection until the end of stage three (in 2005), the EU will in the meantime be a natural target for Indian and Chinese exports of wool cloths,&quot; wool industry executives said in the document.</p>
<p>&quot;The EU is under no obligation to re-integrate any products under quota at this stage and we believe that unless there is some reciprocity from the exporting countries, it should not do so,&quot; according to the dopcument saent to the DTI.</p>
<p>Export earnings from UK wool textiles totalled 339 million in 1995.</p>
<p>The wool industry argued that delaying re-integration until stage three will enable the industry to take defensive action and the EU to retain &quot;a bargaining counter.&quot;</p>
<p>There is room for further negotiation, according to the document.</p>
<p>As wool products account for only 0.11 percent of all textile and clothing imports, removing them from the list would not compromise the EU's commitment to re-integrate 17 percent of the trade.</p>
<p>The industry also wanted woollen tops deleted and replaced by &quot;less sensitive&quot; products.</p>
<p>&quot;The British wool textile industry is a major exporting industry and is exceedingly frustrated at being effectively shut-out of a number of potentially lucrative markets,&quot; the document said.</p>
