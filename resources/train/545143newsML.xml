<p>South Korean merchant banks on Monday joined a committee to bail out the debt-ridden Jinro Group, but only after commercial banks agreed to exempt them from granting additional credit to the conglomerate.</p>
<p>&quot;We have agreed to cooperate with the commercial banks and abide by the committee's decisions,&quot; said a director of the Merchant Banks Association of Korea. He declined to be named.</p>
<p>The committee, formed voluntarily on April 18 by banks to keep Jinro and other troubled corporates afloat, has agreed to defer debt payments and extend new credit. Committee members were meeting on Monday afternoon to determine their next step.</p>
<p>Participation of the merchant banks removed a major obstacle to rescuing the stricken group, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;An important point has now been passed in the crisis,&quot; said Namuh Rhee, head of research at Dongbang Peregrine Securities. &quot;Jinro will now be able to get an emergency cash infusion until its asset fire-sale plan begins making money.&quot;</p>
<p>Jinro, the nation's 19th largest group, has said it will sell property and affiliates to raise cash to pay debts, estimated at 3.2 trillion won ($3.58 billion).</p>
<p>The Jinro Group, the country's oldest and largest maker of Korea's distilled liquor &quot;soju&quot;, has estimated the asset sale will raise about 1.2 trillion won by the end of 1998.</p>
<p>The group's prime creditor bank, the Commercial Bank of Korea, earlier designated the group's flagship Jinro Ltd and five other affiliates for bail-out.</p>
<p>At the end of 1996, the six firms accounted for 80.7 percent of the group's total sales turnover and 90 percent of total assets, according to data released by the Commercial Bank.</p>
<p>Merchant banks hold most of the 1.7 trillion won in debts Jinro owes to non-bank financial firms, while commercial banks are owed 1.2 trillion won, the Federation of Korean Banks said.</p>
<p>Merchant banks, with smaller capital bases, typically extend short-term loans with little or no collateral by discounting commercial paper and promissory notes.</p>
<p>With the country still reeling from the collapse of Hanbo Steel Co in January and Sammi Steel Co in March, the government last week said it would set up a 1.5 trillion won fund to buy, repackage and sell banks' bad debts.</p>
<p>Analysts said the government worried that a third high-profile bankruptcy would reveal the weakness of the country's banking system which could affect the ruling party's chances in December's presidential election.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the plan that the merchant banks have agreed to today is, if anything, aimed as much at keeping the commercial banking system afloat and preventing problems there as it is in keeping a manufacturer afloat,&quot; said Graham Courtney, director of Asian economics at SBC Warburg in Tokyo.</p>
