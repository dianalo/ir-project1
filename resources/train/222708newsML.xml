<p>A former police officer was sentenced to 261 years in jail on Thursday for his self-confessed role in a shooting spree in which eight street children died more than three years ago.</p>
<p>A state jury of five men and two women declared Nelson Oliveira dos Santos Cunha, 29, guilty on eight charges of murder and one of attempted murder after a 20-hour hearing that went through the night.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Cunha) is a violent personality with no sense of solidarity whatsoever and no respect for human dignity,&quot; said Judge Jose Geraldo Antonio.</p>
<p>Cunha, a recent born-again Christian who resigned from the Rio police force after the massacre, voluntarily confessed his role in the killings to police last April. He made his confession just days before the first of five men accused of the massacre, Marcus Vinicius Borges Emmanuel, went on trial.</p>
<p>Under Brazilian law, Cunha can serve a maximum of only 30 years and has the right to appeal against the sentence. Emmanuel, who was sentenced to 309 years in jail in April, had his sentence reduced by 220 years at a retrial.</p>
<p>Six children were killed when men opened fire indiscriminately on about 70 children playing or sleeping on the steps of the Candelaria Church early on July 23, 1993. Two others had been killed earlier and left nearby, and six children were injured in the shooting spree.</p>
<p>Cunha said he, Emmanuel and two other police officers, one of whom has since been murdered and one who is awaiting trial, committed the killings. Three other men accused of the Candelaria massacre are due in court Dec. 9.</p>
<p>Cunha said he accidentally shot one of the surviving victims of the massacre, Wagner dos Santos, who is also a key witness in the Candelaria trials. But Santos testified it was another police officer, Carlos Jorge Liaffa, who shot him.</p>
<p>Human rights activists fear justice may not be done if Santos' testimony is not taken seriously. Liaffa was arrested, but was set free because the other defendants in the Candelaria trials say he did not take part in the shootings.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Cunha) is guilty, but this does not mean an end to the battle to recognise Wagner's claims as valid, and that Liaffa has to be indicted next,&quot; said Yvonne Bezerra de Melo, who has worked with the Candelaria street children since before the massacre.</p>
<p>More than three years later, rights activists say the number of children living on the streets of Rio has grown, with estimates ranging between 750 and 2,500.</p>
<p>The National Movement of Streetchildren says four minors are killed every day in Brazil, principally victims of the police, death squads often comprising off-duty police officers or drug gangs. About 90 percent of cases never make it to court.</p>
