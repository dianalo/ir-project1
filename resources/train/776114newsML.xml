<p>India, the world's largest consumer of gold, is expected to further liberalise imports as part of economic reform and to boost jewellery exports, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Bullion and jewellery trade members who attended a gold seminar at the weekend in New Delhi said they expect a more liberal gold policy in the the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;There are indications the government will further liberalise its gold policy,&quot; said Bombay Bullion Association president Makhan Lal Damani.</p>
<p>He said measures under consideration included allowing free imports of gold and resumption of forward trading in bullion, banned in 1962.</p>
<p>&quot;These measures may take some time to materialise,&quot; Damani said. &quot;They will boost gold imports and jewellery exports.&quot;</p>
<p>In his address to the seminar, S.S. Tarapore, who heads a panel on how to achieve the rupee's full float on the capital account, called for free gold imports.</p>
<p>&quot;... I have no hesitation in saying that the import of gold should be placed under open general licence (OGL),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Y.V. Reddy, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said more banks would be allowed to import gold.</p>
<p>At present expatriate Indians are allowed to import up to 10 kgs gold every six months, subject to a duty of 220 rupees per 10 grammes.</p>
<p>Currently, the government-run State Bank of India (SBI) and state-run trading company MMTC Ltd are allowed to import gold for supplies to jewellers.</p>
<p>Damani said he expected India's gold imports to touch 500 tonnes in 1997/98 (April/March) against 409 in the previous year.</p>
<p>V.M Kapoor, president of the Bombay-based Gold Jewellery Exporters' Association, said six more banks would soon start supplying gold.</p>
<p>&quot;These banks can set up gold accounts, buy and sell gold and give gold loans,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But free imports under OGL may take some time to materialise as the issue is linked to the rupee's full convertibility on the capital account,&quot; Kapoor said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing appears concrete at the moment. But we understand the government is keen on ensuring an uninterrupted supply of gold to jewellery exporters,&quot; Kapoor said.</p>
<p>Indian gold jewellery exports are expected to touch $850 million in 1997/98 against $745 million the previous year and reach $1.5 billion by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>In the week to Monday in Bombay, gold gained a modest five rupees per 10 grammes to 4,530 rupees and dealers expect prices to remain firm in the coming days ahead of a four-month festival season.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Pakistan, prices were weaker and were likely to slip further in line with a fall in international prices and depressed domestic demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for gold has fallen in the past few months because of the country's weak economic conditions,&quot; dealer Farooq Qureshi said. &quot;Falling gold rates abroad also affected domestic market.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers in Dubai, the market that supplies gold to India and Pakistan, welcomed Indian officials' comments indicating a further relaxation in the gold import policy.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short and medium term liberalisation is going to be positive for Dubai,&quot; said Rolf Schneebeli, the World Gold Council's chief executive for the Middle East and Indian-subcontinent based in Dubai.</p>
