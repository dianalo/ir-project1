<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam on Tuesday blasted as discriminatory a French decision to scuttle the sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics, saying France could not be trusted.</p>
<p>&quot;The South Korean people believe we have been totally discriminated against,&quot; Kim told a French presidential envoy sent to try to repair the damage.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a bad impression of France and have come to think France cannot be trusted,&quot; he told Jean-Claude Paye in unusually blunt language.</p>
<p>Many South Koreans regard the snub to Daewoo, which had offered to buy the consumer electronics division of state-owned Thomson SA, as an act of overt racism.</p>
<p>&quot;We hear the privatisation is being reviewed. It would be fortunate if the result is satisfactory otherwise there will be a major impact on Korean-French relations,&quot; Kim was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
<p>Kim gave no indication there would be any immediate repercussions for French business contracts.</p>
<p>But he made a jab at an Anglo-French high-speed railway system, the Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV), that South Korea has bought. He noted the system had been disrupted by recent freezing weather in France.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the TGV's failure was because there were some flaws,&quot; he said. &quot;We will continue to expand TGV to other lines but it is true that we are greatly shocked.&quot;</p>
<p>South Korea signed a contract in 1994 for the TGV made by GEC-Alsthom, a joint venture between Alcatel Alsthom of France and Britain's GEC Plc.</p>
<p>&quot;We have usually had a good impression of France and expected cooperative relations would rise in an upbeat mood after the TGV contract was signed,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Thomsom issue had been widely reported in the domestic media. People thought Daewoo would buy it. But things did not happen that way, arousing a great deal of misunderstanding.&quot;</p>
<p>A week after scrapping its original plan, the French government said it would privatise Thomson in two stages, first selling its profitable defence arm Thomson-CSF, then the money-losing Thomson Multimedia.</p>
<p>On Monday Paye promised South Korean Finance Minister Han Seung-soo fair competition for the re-launched privatisation.</p>
<p>A ministry statement quoted Paye as saying a decision by France's privatisation commission to scrap the sale of Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe was regrettable.</p>
<p>The commission objected to the sale to Daewoo of Thomson Multimedia, citing concerns over technology transfers.</p>
<p>Han told Paye a Daewoo purchase of the Thomson unit would have contributed to better economic relations between France and South Korea. Daewoo had promised to create thousands of new jobs in France after taking over Thomson Multimedia and its huge debts for a symbolic sum.</p>
<p>&quot;If the privatisation had been successful, that would have greatly helped Korea-French economic ties,&quot; Han said.</p>
<p>Underlying Kim's anger, he berated France for dragging its heels over the return to South Korea of a literary masterpiece now in a French museum.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue is a matter of trust between countries and peoples,&quot; he told Pye.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a view that our government has been deceived. Delaying for four years by making this and that excuse will in the end damage the relations between our two countries&quot;.</p>
