<p>Mexican stocks sharply extended their initital advance to chalk up a new intraday record in early dealing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said share prices soared as foreign investors flooded the bolsa with buy orders following strong earnings reports, with rock-bottom U.S. long bond yields providing a strong tailwind.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index was up 84.96 points, or 1.77 percent, at a new trading record of 4,882.45.  </p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners are buying in droves.  They put plenty of cash into the market yesterday and are doing so again today,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the extent of foreign capital flow could be seen in the foreign exchange market, where benchmark 48-hour peso contracts were 2.6 centavos firmer at 7.7570/7.7590 per dollar, despite the potentially debilitating effect of cuts in domestic interest rates on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was meanwhile up 27/32 to yield 6.33 percent.  </p>
<p>Dealers noted conglomerate Grupo Carso and financial group Bancomer were both trading at record levels.</p>
<p>Carso was up 2.10 to 61.00 pesos on a favorable market reaction to second quarter earnings posted on Monday, but which analysts were digesting early Wednesday as they listened to a conference call, dealers said.</p>
<p>Bancomer had risen 20 centavos to 5.08 pesos. Dealers said a benign domestic and international interest rate environment would tend to ease the group's past-due loans problem.  The group was also due to unveil on Wednesday a new plan to reschedule mortage debts it holds.</p>
