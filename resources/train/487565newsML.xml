<p>The Islamic Resistance group Hamas said on Friday the United States and Israel were colluding to keep its former politburo chief Moussa Abu Marzook imprisoned unjustifiably and called for his immediate release.</p>
<p>Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh said Washington was keeping Abu Marzook in jail so Israel could revive its request for his extradition when it was less worried about a violent backlash provoked by his transfer to an Israeli jail</p>
<p>Israel announced on Thursday it was suspending its request for Abu Marzook's extradition but U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said the 47-year-old Palestinian political activist would remain in U.S. custody.</p>
<p>Ghosheh said Abu Marzook, who has been held in New York without charge or trial for nearly two years, should be set free at once.</p>
<p>&quot;The American administration is playing an open game with collusion of (Israeli Pime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu's Zionist government to keep Moussa Abu Marzook for as long as possible,&quot; Ghosheh told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Hamas views this American conspiracy with anger...and vehemently rejects this manipulation of the so-called American justice,&quot; Ghosheh told Reuters.</p>
<p>Abu Marzook said on Thursday he believed a deal had been struck to send him to Jordan, which expelled him in June 1995 under pressure from Israel and the United States.</p>
<p>Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam al-Majali said his country was ready to help if the United States wanted Abu Marzook to return to Jordan.</p>
