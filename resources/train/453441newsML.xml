<title>FRANCE: Doctors charged in French AIDS blood scandal.</title>
<headline>Doctors charged in French AIDS blood scandal.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Seven French doctors have been placed under judicial investigation for alleged poisoning in a scandal involving AIDS-contaminated blood in transfusions in 1984 and 1985, justice sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The doctors are suspected of knowingly prescribing contaminated blood products to one or more haemophiliacs and thus being responsible for their contracting AIDS.</p>
<p>According to official statistics, 1,325 heamophiliacs and 2,600 transfusion recipients were contaminated by blood products infected with the virus that causes AIDS during the period under investigation. More than 400 have since died.</p>
<p>Paris Judge Marie-Odile Bertella-Geffroy notified the doctors, all experts in haemophilia, of the charges in registered letters. Her decision takes to 21 the number of people under investigation in the case.</p>
<p>The probe is being conducted alongside an investigation by the Court of Justice of the Republic into the possible responsibility of former Socialist prime minister Laurent Fabius, and ex-cabinet ministers Edmond Herve and Georgina Dufoix.</p>
<p>That court decided to extend the investigation even though the Paris public prosecutor recommended last week dropping the probe into the three politicians on suspicion of being accomplices to poisoning.</p>
<p>Poisoning is an offence which carries a maximum 30-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>The doctors are alleged to have attended a meeting on December 19, 1984, in which the danger of non-heated blood products was established, but they all continued to prescribe the products without warning the haemophiliacs.</p>
