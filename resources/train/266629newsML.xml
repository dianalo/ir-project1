<p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus comes to Romania this weekend after the Fund's analysts exposed an even more devastated economy than previously believed.</p>
<p>Camdessus will spend less than 24 hours in Bucharest in what officials say is mostly a morale-boosting introduction to the new centrist government ahead of talks next month on resuming credits suspended by the Fund this year.</p>
<p>&quot;He is coming to show support for the government and meet the new ministers in it,&quot; IMF resident representative John Hill said by telephone. &quot;He is here to get acquainted.&quot;</p>
<p>After a week-long assessment of the economy, the IMF chief negotiator for Romania, Poul Thomsen, concluded the country had sunk into a grimmer crisis than had been thought when ex-communists were defeated in last month's general election.</p>
<p>But he backed the new cabinet's broad commitment to speed up market reforms.</p>
<p>Thomsen agreed with ministers to abandon the $460 million three-year standby accord suspended by the Fund this year and begin talks on a new credit arrangement in mid-January.</p>
<p>The Fund halted disbursements after objecting to foreign exchange market restrictions and overspending by the leftist government ahead of the election.</p>
<p>&quot;Camdessus's visit is a political gesture to encourage the new cabinet but this does not mean the Fund will ease its demands on Romania,&quot; independent analyst Ilie Serbanescu said.</p>
<p>&quot;The unequivocal conclusion is that the situation is much worse. Without urgent measures our situation could begin to look like Bulgaria's woes.&quot;</p>
<p>Recent indicators have confirmed the Fund's dire warnings.</p>
<p>Inflation is running near a year-on-year 50 percent, far in excess of the IMF's recommendation of 20 percent, and the budget deficit has soared to 5.7 percent of gross domestic product from initial pledges of 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>Most serious, perhaps, is a 1996 current account deficit forecast of $1.9 billion, according to IMF estimates.</p>
<p>The cabinet's programme lacks concrete figures, though it pledges to tackle economic imbalances, speed reforms, liberalise foreign exchange markets and boost social benefits.</p>
<p>The Fund urged Romania after Thomsen's visit to contain budget expansion and postpone for a time child benefit rises.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF will release no money for consumption,&quot; Serbanescu said. &quot;Given the current limited room for manouevre, we need an extremely austere programme, maybe more austere than in 1994. We should no longer delay reforms at enterprise level.&quot;</p>
<p>Tough monetary policy implemented in 1994 when Romania signed the latest IMF accord, cut inflation from 300 percent in 1993 to 61.7 percent within a year and to 27.8 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>But inflation reignited this year and the Fund said its underlying trend might be higher than the current figure.</p>
<p>First signs that the government was moving on reforms emerged this week when the leu currency was allowed to slide three percent to 3,880/3,930 to the dollar in a single day.</p>
<p>But its value, held artificially high since foreign exchange restrictions were imposed last March, is still well above rates of 4,750 at Bucharest street currency shops.</p>
<p>The IMF also urged Romania to increase the discount rate to make it positive in real terms, cut central bank funds for the farming sector and raise petrol and energy prices.</p>
