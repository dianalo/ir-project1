<p>Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov, worried by the advances of the Islamist Taleban militia in neighbouring Afghanistan, has held urgent talks with his security advisers, his spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The president held an urgent meeting late on Saturday with Tajikistan's &quot;force&quot; officials, including those of the security ministry, the army and border guards,&quot; spokesman Zafar Saidov told Reuters by telephone from the Tajik capital Dushanbe.</p>
<p>&quot;The only issue on the agenda was the advance of the Taleban movement in northern Afghanistan and measures to be taken to safeguard security in Tajikistan,&quot; he said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Another Tajik official said security officials had resumed their discussions early on Sunday.</p>
<p>A representative of the Russian border guards in Tajikistan told Reuters there had been an increased influx of refugees from Afghanistan into Tajikistan through the checkpoint at Nizhny Pyandzh some 200 km (125 miles) south of Dushanbe.</p>
<p>He gave no estimate of their number.</p>
<p>Renewed concern about Afghanistan was sparked by the fall on Saturday of the main northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, a former stronghold of opposition leader General Abdual Rashid Dostum, to the radical Islamist Taleban.</p>
<p>Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek, has reportedly fled to neighbouring Uzbekistan, one of his staunchest supporters in his struggle against the Taleban, but officials in the Uzbek capital Tashkent could not be reached for immediate comment on Sunday.</p>
<p>In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned the Taleban not to violate the borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), successor to the Sovet Union.</p>
<p>&quot;(Any infringement) will provoke very tough and effective actions from the CIS side,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Primakov as saying. On Saturday Moscow issued a statement expressing its alarm over events in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Primakov has made clear that Moscow regards the Taleban as incapable of uniting Afghanistan because it lacks broad support among the country's many ethnic minorities, who include Tajiks and Uzbeks.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan and the intelligence services of several Western countries could help put pressure on the Taleban to behave with restraint.</p>
<p>Russia and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia fear that regional security could be shattered by the rise of militant, Taleban-style Islam.</p>
<p>Russia -- separated from Afghanistan by more than 1,000 km of Kazakh territory -- has some 20,000 troops stationed in Tajikistan, who guard the remote, mountainous Afghan border and view themselves as a shield against Islamist fundamentalism.</p>
<p>Last month Rakhmonov said that up to a million refugees could pour from Afghanistan into his impoverished country of 5.7 million people if there was fierce fighting in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On Sunday Interfax quoted Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov in the Iranian capital Tehran as saying that his war-ravaged country could not cope with such an influx.</p>
<p>&quot;However our republic will not throw these people to the whim of fate and will make a contribution to helping them, though their best hope lies with other countries and with international organisations,&quot; Interfax quoted Nazarov as saying.</p>
<p>Rakhmonov's secular government and the united Islamist opposition agreed last year on a ceasefire to end a four-year civil war that left tens of thousands killed and drove many more from their homes.</p>
<p>But the fragile peace is often shaken by armed bands and by drug traders based in Afghanistan.</p>
