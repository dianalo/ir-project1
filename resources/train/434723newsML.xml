<p>Hong Kong stocks erased the session's gains to end weaker on Tuesday, with investors selling down property stocks and turning their attention to second line counters, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index fell 16.56 points, or 0.12 percent, to 13,252.20 after rising to a session high of 13,342.46. Turnover was HK$13.37 billion compared with HK$13.11 billion on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very weak market for blue-chip stocks and it has been the case for a while,&quot; said Frederick Tsang, head of research at PrimeEast Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;People are selling blue chips to buy second liner stocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Property stocks led the blue-chip index lower on Tuesday, shrugging off a new record high on Wall Street. The Dow industrials rose 78.50 points on Monday to an all-time closing high of 7,079.39.</p>
<p>Shares in Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd fell HK$0.75 to HK$73.50 and Henderson Land Development Co finished down HK$0.50 at HK$67.50.</p>
<p>&quot;The property market went up a lot and a lot of investors are worried about whether prices are sustainable,&quot; said Patrick Chia, research director at China Everbright Research.</p>
<p>&quot;Another thing is interest rate worries. There are worries that a rate hike will happen later on,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Among the red chips, First Shanghai Investments Ltd soared HK$0.13 to HK$0.99 and China Resources Beijing Land Ltd rose HK$0.05 to HK$5.55.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess there are some rumours about an upcoming interest rate cut in China and there are a lot of rumours about asset injections on a number of red chips,&quot; said Chia.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were looking to make quick gains in the second line counters.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the risk, it gives investors a way to make a quick 20 or 30 percent,&quot; said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Shum Yip Investment Ltd succumbed to profit-taking following a surge in its share price since its listing last Friday. The stock ended on a loss of HK$0.325 at HK$4.975. Its initial public offering was launched at HK$1.85 per share.</p>
<p>Shangri-La Asia Ltd fell HK$0.20 to HK$9.25. The hotel operator is due to release its 1996 results on Friday and analysts expect net profit growth of about 21 percent.</p>
<p>Shares in HSBC Holdings Plc rose HK$1.50 to HK$191.50 and Hang Seng Bank Ltd added HK$0.50 to HK$84.75.</p>
