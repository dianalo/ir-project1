<p>Leopold Sedar Senghor, president of Senegal for 20 years and an early champion of black culture, plans a quiet celebration of his 90th birthday on Wednesday in northwestern France, local officials say.</p>
<p>The poet and philospher who invented &quot;Negritude&quot; -- the idea that &quot;Black is beautiful&quot; -- is extremely frail in old age and rarely receives visitors in his adopted Normandy town of Verson.</p>
<p>Senghor, who stepped down as president of his West African nation in 1980, lives with his French-born wife in virtual isolation in the town of 3,500 people about 10 km (six miles) south of Caen, the officials said.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday he will venture out of his home to Verson's Senghor Centre for a modest party in his honour.</p>
<p>Local notables will deliver a few short speeches, children will recite poetry and play music, and balloons will be released, after which he will return home.</p>
<p>The event will be in marked contrast to far more lively celebrations planned for the day in the Senegalese fishing village of Joal, where Senghor was born on October 9, 1906, and in the capital Dakar.</p>
<p>An elaborate party is also planned nine days later at the Paris headquarters of UNESCO, where the presidents of Senegal, Mali and France will pay hommage to one of Africa's best-known statesmen.</p>
<p>But Senghor will not be there, too weak to travel the 200 km (120 miles), UNESCO officials have acknowledged.</p>
<p>&quot;He is very tired, very old,&quot; Dorothee Lemonnier, director of Verson's Senghor Centre, told Reuters. &quot;He no longer receives any visitors. But considering his age, he is doing well enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Senghor, chosen by missionaries for a Catholic education in Senegal, pursued his studies in France from the age of 19.</p>
<p>He read French at the Sorbonne between the wars, making friends with philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, author Albert Camus and Caribbean nationalist writer Aime Cesaire.</p>
<p>He became in 1983 the first black man to be elected a member of the Academie Francaise, the watchdog of the French language which gathers its most prestigious writers.</p>
<p>In addition to politics, Senghor devoted much of his life to the glorification of the black man's culture through books, poetry and scholarly works.</p>
<p>Without black Africans, civilisation would &quot;lack the rhythm section of its orchestra, the bass voice of its choir,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wear European clothing and the Americans dance to jazz which derives from our African rhythms -- civilisation in the 20th century is universal. No people can get along without others,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He was elected Senegal's first president in September 1960, just a month after it proclaimed its independence from France.</p>
<p>He was twice re-elected and stepped down voluntarily on December 31, 1980, saying it was time to hand over the flame to a new generation of leaders.</p>
<p>After leaving power, Senghor, who had spent his summers in France even when Senegal's president, devoted himself almost exclusively to cultural activities and spent more and more of his time in France.</p>
