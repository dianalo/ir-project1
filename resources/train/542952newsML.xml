<p>Champions D.C. United dropped their first game of the Major League Soccer season, losing a two-goal lead in the second-half in a 3-2 shootout loss to the San Jose Clash to highlight this weekend's action.</p>
<p>Second-half substitute Jeff Baicher led the San Jose comeback with goals in the 67th and 76th minutes after Bolivian Jaime Moreno and Salvadoran Raul Diaz Arce connected for United (4-1) in the opening half of Saturday night's game.</p>
<p>San Jose (3-3) won the shootout 2-0 on goals from Dominic Kinnear and Lawrence Lozzano as goalkeeper Dave Salzwedel made two saves.</p>
<p>The loss snapped United's nine-game winning streak, dating back to last year's title run. The Clash played without three key starters -- U.S. international striker Eric Wynalda (strained groin), MLS defender of the year John Doyle (flu) and Nigerian midfielder Ben Iroha (World Cup commitments).</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Mutiny (4-1), on the strength of its 3-2 shootout victory over the Kansas City Wizards (3-2) in Kansas City, moved into a first-place tie with United in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Steve Ralston, the MLS rookie of the year last season, converted the game-winning goal in the shootout, which Tampa Bay won, 4-3.</p>
<p>Ivan McKinley and Nelson Vargas scored goals in regulation for the Mutiny, which played without Colombian star midfielder Carlos Valderrama (World Cup commitments) and striker Roy Lassiter (injury), while former Scottish international Mo Johnston and Paul Wright tallied for Kansas City.</p>
<p>Despite playing without their top two scoring threats, the New York/New Jersey MetroStars (2-4) posted a 2-1 comeback win over the Columbus Crew (3-2) in East Rutherford, New Jersey.</p>
<p>A minute after Brian McBride had given the Crew a 1-0 lead, A.J. Wood equalised in the sixth minute. U.S. international midfielder Mike Sorber scored the game-winner in the 17th minute. The MetroStars were without forwards Antony DeAvila of Colombia and Giovanni Savarese of Venezuela, who were preparing for World Cup qualifiers.</p>
<p>After surrendering the game-tying goal by former U.S. National Team captain Peter Vermes with one second remaining in regulation, the New England Revolution (3-2) recovered in the shootout to stop the Colorado Rapids 2-1 in Foxboro.</p>
<p>Former Italian international goalkeeper Walter Zenga made three saves in the shootout, won by New England, 2-1, as Imad Baba and Argentine Alberto Naveda converted their attempts. U.S. international Joe-Max Moore had a penalty kick for the Revolution.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the Rapids (2-5) blanked the Dallas Burn 1-0 on Paul Bravo's goal before 4,120, the smallest crowd in MLS history, in Denver.</p>
<p>The Burn (3-4) rebounded from the loss with a 2-1 shootout victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy (1-4) in Pasadena to move into first place in the Western Conference, despite having a losing record.</p>
<p>Gerrell Elliott, who scored the Burn's lone goal in regulation, recorded the winning shootout goal after teammates Peter Hattrup, Tom Soehn and Mark Santel converted their tries as the visitors prevailed in the tie-breaker, 4-1.</p>
<p>Salvadoran international Mauricio Cienfuegos scored a penalty kick for the struggling Galaxy, which reached the MLS championship game last season.</p>
