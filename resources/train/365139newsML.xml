<p>Sampdoria owner Enrico Mantovani said on Saturday that his Italian serie A club had a replacement for Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson lined up already for next season but refused to name him.</p>
<p>Eriksson, whose team are now second, two points behind Juventus in serie A, has committed himself to moving to English premier league club Blackburn Rovers next season.</p>
<p>Mantovani told La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper in an interview that a successor was ready but he could give no details because it would be too easy to identify him.</p>
<p>The paper said the frontrunners were believed to be Uruguayan former Milan coach Oscar Washington Tabarez, who was replaced by Arrigo Sacchi late last year, and Napoli's Luigi Simoni, who started off as a coach at Genoa.</p>
