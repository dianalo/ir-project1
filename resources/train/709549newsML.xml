<p>Cambodian strongman Hun Sen on Sunday unilaterally ousted his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as First Prime Minister after two days of fighting on the streets of the capital that left at least 12 people dead and more than 50 wounded.</p>
<p>Second Prime Minister Hun Sen spoke in a radio broadcast after battles between his troops and those loyal to Ranariddh, son of Cambodia's ailing King Sihanouk.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is ready to choose a new First Prime Minister,&quot; said Hun Sen, whose Cambodian People's Party (CPP) were the country's former communist rulers. He said the situation was under control and called for shops and businesses to open normally on Monday.</p>
<p>The prince, whose FUNCINPEC party won a 1993 election organised by the United Nations, said in a statement from Paris on Saturday that Hun Sen had launched a coup against him. Cambodian radio controlled by Hun Sen denied the accusation.</p>
<p>Former finance minister Sam Rainsy told Reuters that Ranariddh had left France, where he was said to have been visiting relatives, and was flying to Bangkok and intended to travel overland from the Thai capital to Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>The road to the airport remained closed and all flights in and out of Phnom Penh were cancelled, leaving hundreds of foreigners stranded in the city, many in temporary accommodation.</p>
<p>Hun Sen said he did himself not want the post of first prime minister. &quot;The position of first prime minister is in FUNCINPEC's quota so let FUNCINPEC adopt a political figure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen's forces captured FUNCINPEC party headquarters in central Phnom Penh and Ranariddh's residence in the heart of the city on Sunday.</p>
<p>By late in the day, Ranariddh's forces still held ground to the west of the city and their Tang Krasang military base near the airport.</p>
<p>A military analyst in Phnom Penh said he expected more fighting on Sunday night or on Monday when Hun Sen's forces attempted to take further FUNCINPEC positions.</p>
<p>Clashes in the Southeast Asian capital stopped as a curfew took effect at 8 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Sunday, though there was occasional gunfire later. The curfew lasts until 6 a.m. (2300 GMT).</p>
<p>A Thai army general who monitors Cambodian affairs but declined to be identified told Reuters he believed Hun Sen had already won the power struggle.</p>
<p>At least 12 people have been killed and 50 wounded, hospital sources and local news reports said. A 38-year old Japanese man died from his wounds after a rocket hit his house, a Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said.</p>
<p>The two premiers have jointly headed a fractured coalition government formed after a United Nations-run election in 1993 which brought hopes of peace to the ravaged country after three decades of conflict.</p>
<p>Last week, Hun Sen accused Ranariddh of illegally introducing defectors from the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group into Phnom Penh to bolster his forces. The first premier denied this.</p>
<p>The dreaded Maoist group has seemed to be disintegrating in recent months with the defection of key leaders and their soldiers.</p>
<p>Khmer Rouge front man Khieu Samphan, who has been negotiating with the Phnom Penh authorities, said in a radio broadcast on Sunday he supported the country's constitution.</p>
<p>Samphan also said that the movement had officially broken all ties with former leader Pol Pot, held responsible for the genocide of more than one million Cambodians during the movement's 1975-79 &quot;killing fields&quot; rule.</p>
<p>Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party headquarters and the French embassy next door were both heavily damaged by shellfire, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been hit by some heavy cannon,&quot; an official at the embassy said. &quot;The ambassador's office and the office of the military attache were completely destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>France is the former colonial power in Cambodia but there was no suggestion that the building had been deliberately targeted.</p>
<p>Fifteen embassy staff, French and Cambodian, were in the embassy when it was hit but none was injured, he said.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Quinn told reporters many soldiers loyal to Hun Sen were moving around his embassy. He said he had forcefully conveyed his concerns to officials from both sides.</p>
<p>By Sunday afternoon Hun Sen's troops were moving through the city street by street as heavy fighting continued around pockets held by Ranariddh's men.</p>
<p>Military officials loyal to Hun Sen said they were demanding the surrender of Ranariddh's troops protecting some of his facilities. But Ranariddh's top military commander, General Nhiek Bun Chhay, vowed earlier that there would be no surrender.</p>
<p>Thailand's military put three C-130 planes on standby to evacuate more than 300 of its nationals when conditions allowed. Australian Defence Attache David Mead led a 60-strong group of expatriates in an overland convoy from northwestern Cambodia to Thailand.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether fighting was going on in other parts of Cambodia. There were reports on Saturday of clashes in the south, but none could be independently confirmed.</p>
<p>Mead, the Australian attache, said he had driven to Thailand via Battambang, close to the frontier, and tensions were running very high in the region between Ranariddh and Hun Sen troops.</p>
<p>Sam Rainsy said he had information from Bangkok that Ranariddh forces had destroyed several tanks controlled by Hun Sen's troops and were headed south to Takhmau, Hun Sen's stronghold 15 km (10 miles) south of the capital.</p>
<p>King Sihanouk, who has been undergoing medical treatment in Beijing, called on both sides to end the fighting and summoned the warring co-premiers to the Chinese capital to hammer out a solution.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether his appeal would be heeded.</p>
