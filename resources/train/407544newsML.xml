<p>Alabama School Superintendent Ed Richardson has appointed a financial adviser to the Birmingham school district and threatened to take it over unless the district improves its fiscal status by the end of June, a state official said Thursday.</p>
<p>The city school district is the latest among a half-dozen to face state intervention since the legislature gave the Education Department added responsibility to oversee school district budgets in 1995.</p>
<p>Deputy state superintendent Jimmy Baker said Birmingham's operating balance has dropped from $30 million four years ago to just $10 million, while its nutrition program had a $2 million deficit last year. The system's maintenance program also has serious operating problems that have raised concern about the condition of the schools.</p>
<p>&quot;Those factors all kind of weigh together to create an environment where we were concerned. It's not that they are broke or that they can't correct it. We're saying, 'You've got to reverse this environment,'&quot; Baker said.</p>
<p>The state has given the school district until the end of June to draft a plan to resolve the other deficiencies. The superintendent could take over the district if the plan is deemed inadequate although, &quot;We certainly hope we don't have to do that,&quot; Baker said.</p>
<p>He said overstaffing was &quot;a major factor&quot; in the district's problems. The state is pushing Birmingham to move quickly to prune its staff because by law, districts must tell employees by the end of the school year whether they will have jobs next year.</p>
<p>The Birmingham school district has about 40,000 students.</p>
<p>Baker said two other of the state's 127 school districts, Marshall County and City of Fairfield, had recently been removed from state control and given a clean bill of finanical health.</p>
<p>Marshall was taken over last year because it had a $1.4 million deficit, but will have a positive balance this year. Fairfield has erased a $1 million deficit, Baker said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have turned their financial condition around,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Two other school districts, Wilcox County and Barbour County, are expected to be removed from state control soon, Baker said.</p>
<p>Wilcox was taken over last year because it had no system of accounting for public funds and its records were so muddled that state officials could not tell whether it had a deficit. They &quot;are making significant progress&quot; and could come off the takeover list within 18 months, Baker said.</p>
<p>Barbour had a $400,000 deficit when it was taken over last year. State officials are reviewing its finances &quot;to see if we are in a position where we can say they're clear now,&quot; Baker said.</p>
<p>Two other districts, in Randolph and Macon counties, remain under state control.</p>
<p>Randolph, which had a $600,000 deficit last year, is tied up in litigation over the election of its superintendent.</p>
<p>&quot;They have made significant progress finanically but there are some elements that are not financial,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Macon County was taken over earlier this year when it failed to meet a deadline to erase a $3 million shortfall. Many of its financial records were destroyed in a mysterious fire shortly after the state announced a potential takeover.</p>
<p>The state is also reviewing Lawrence County's school budget. It has requested approval to issue $5 million to $10 million of new debt but will have a zero budget balance at the end of the year, Baker said.</p>
<p>&quot;From what we've seen they do not have a plan in place for how they're going to manage the debt,&quot; Baker said.</p>
<p>He said it was unlikely the district would be taken over but that the state may reject its budget.</p>
