<p>Royal prestige and good timing helped Jordan's King Hussein break a deadlock in Israeli-PLO peace moves and steal the show from Egypt and the United States, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a question of timing,&quot; said political analyst Chemi Shalev of the Israeli newspaper Maariv.</p>
<p>He said Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat were looking for a way out of their stalemate when the king arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;Both Netanyahu and Arafat realised that if there was no compromise, the agreement would unravel,&quot; he said -- and neither leader could reject the prestige of King Hussein's good offices.</p>
<p>Israeli-PLO peace moves were on the verge of collapse when King Hussein stepped in on Sunday, flying by helicopter to Gaza and Tel Aviv to help close the gap on a date for an Israeli army pullback from rural areas in the West Bank.</p>
<p>A senior aide to Arafat said that Jordan and Egypt -- the two countries to sign peace treaties with Israel -- had both played a positive role in breaking the stalemate.</p>
<p>Analysts say the deadlock reflected the mistrust between the sides since Netanyahu, the right-wing Likud party leader opposed to swapping occupied land for peace, ousted Israel's more dovish Shimon Peres from office in an election last May.</p>
<p>Israel's refusal to hand over rural areas in the West Bank by September 1997 deepened the mistrust and revived Arafat's fears the Israeli leader might eventually seek negotiations with Jordan on the future of the West Bank.</p>
<p>The king controlled the West Bank from 1948 until its capture by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;King Hussein's intervention gave President Arafat personal assurances that he alone was the partner for Israel and the address for the negotiations,&quot; said Mahdi Abdel-Hadi, a leading Palestinian expert on Jordanian affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;The arrival of King Hussein to Gaza was a message that Jordan will not accept to play any role that the Likud may want it to play during the interim or even the final stage of the negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, director-general of Arafat's office, said that Egypt and Jordan, assurances from both the United States and the European Union, and an Israeli willingness to compromise helped break the deadlock.</p>
<p>PLO officials suggest Arafat has been losing faith in the United States as an honest broker since it failed to pressure Israel into sticking to the timetable spelled out in a 1995 Israeli-PLO agreement.</p>
<p>Egypt has also found it difficult to play the mediator's role. Remarks in the Israeli media, apparently planted by Israeli officials, had suggested Cairo was encouraging Arafat not to sign a deal on Hebron.</p>
<p>&quot;The Middle East needed a dramatic intervention by someone like King Hussein to break the psychological barrier and this had to come in coordination with Egypt,&quot; Abdel-Hadi said.</p>
