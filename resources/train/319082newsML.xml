<title>INDIA: Indian banks seen becoming rivals to term lenders.</title>
<headline>Indian banks seen becoming rivals to term lenders.</headline>

<p>Indian commercial bank's entry into term-lending spells lean times ahead for financial institutions, already in a rate war, unless they radically alter fund-raising strategy, Prime Broking Company said on Monday.</p>
<p>So far only State Bank of India has entered the term lending market, but other banks are scouting for opportunities.</p>
<p>Other financial institutions' profitability will suffer in the coming years unless they diversify their income streams and access funds from retail markets to meet competition from banks, a study by the Bombay-based securities firm said.</p>
<p>Poor growth in credit and large lendable resources had induced some leading commercial banks to look at term-lending.</p>
<p>Banks had lower cost of funds, enabling them to undercut financial institutions in some recent instances, Prime said.</p>
<p>&quot;Easy liquidity coupled with sluggish demand for term financing has resulted in a rate war in the market. If the rate war intensifies we could see the already thin spreads of financial institutions coming down to negligible levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime said financial institutions were slow responding to the challenge.</p>
<p>&quot;None of them has yet set in place an organisation or system for deposit or retail fund mobilisation.&quot;</p>
<p>The first step for enabling market making in bonds issued by a financial institution have been initiated by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI). It was too early to evaluate its success, Prime said.</p>
<p>India's leading institutions are the IDBI, the Industrial Credit and Investment Corp of India (ICICI) and the Industrial Finance Corp of India (IFCI).</p>
<p>&quot;As far as improving investor communication and transparency of accounts are concerned, the financial institutions have a long way to go,&quot; Prime analyst Amit Rajpal said in the study.</p>
<p>Excess liquidity caused by repeated cuts in banks' cash reserve requirements and sluggish demand for bank credit has had a negative influence on financial institutions in the short and medium term, the Prime study said.</p>
<p>The financial institutions had raised over 20 billion rupees through public debt issues in the first half of 1996/97 (April-March) at costs ranging between 17.0-18.0 percent.</p>
<p>Only part of these funds could be disbursed in the first half, the rest having been deployed in short-term instruments.</p>
<p>&quot;With the recent fall in the rates of short term instruments, the 'holding cost' of the money has shot up, impacting short-term profitability negatively,&quot; Prime said.</p>
<p>Borrowers were demanding lower rates for long-term money, affecting fresh loan sanctions and medium-term profits.</p>
<p>Indian financial institutions reported a sharp 31 percent fall in loan sanctions in the first half of 1996/97 mainly on account of recessionary conditions in various commodity markets and high lending rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We see this slowdown in sanctions affecting disbursements moderately in the second half of FY1997 (April-March) and dramatically in the first half of FY1998,&quot; Prime said.</p>
<p>It said financial institutions were suffering a knock-on effect from India's policy of liberalisation, which has hurt some some sectors of the economy and reduced their ability to borrow.</p>
