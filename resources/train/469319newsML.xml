<title>CHINA: Gore raises human rights issues with China.</title>
<headline>Gore raises human rights issues with China.</headline>

<p>U.S. Vice President Al Gore said on Wednesday the U.S. side had raised specific cases of human rights problems with Chinese leaders during his visit to Beijing this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Specific names were raised during the course of my visit,&quot; Gore told a news conference.  </p>
<p>However, he did not identify any dissidents who were mentioned by him or any other U.S. officials in talks since he arrived in China on Monday evening.</p>
<p>The Chinese were more receptive to the U.S. position than they had been in the past, he said.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters how he had reached that conclusion, he said the more receptive response was reflected in &quot;the language that was used, the muted tone of the response&quot; compared with their reaction in the past.</p>
<p>China maintains that human rights are its own internal affairs and routinely rebuffs criticism of its rights record.</p>
