<p>Colonial BancGroup, an Alabama-based banking company, has a definitive agreement to acquire Great Southern Bancorp in a stock deal worth about $22.6 million, the companies said Friday.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Colonial will offer $13.05 worth of its stock for each Great Southern share outstanding, or a total of $20.76 million, in a tax-free pooling of interests.</p>
<p>In addition, Montgomery, Ala.-based Colonial will assume Great Southern options based on the $13.05 price per share.</p>
<p>Great Southern Bancorp's subsidiary, Great Southern Bank, will be merged into BancGroup's Florida bank and become a part of Colonial's South Florida region.</p>
<p>The parties had previously signed a letter of intent on Feb. 20.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to approval by regulators and Great Southern's shareholders.</p>
<p>Great Southern, based in West Palm Beach, Fla., has assets of $120 million. It operates three offices in the greater West Palm Beach area and plans to open two more offices in April.</p>
<p>Colonial, a multi-bank holding company, has assets of $6 billion, including pending acquisitions, and 163 full service offices in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Great Southern's stock rose 87.5 cents to $18 on Nasdaq in late morning trading. Colonial gained 25 cents to $23 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
