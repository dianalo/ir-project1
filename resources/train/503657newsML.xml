<p>Iranian police on Friday erected barriers along the outside walls of Germany's embassy in central Tehran a day after a Berlin court accused Iran of ordering the murders of dissidents in Germany, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said police appeared to have built the barricade in anticipation that thousands of worshippers attending the Friday prayers at Tehran University might march the four km (2.5 miles) across the capital to the embassy to protest against the ruling.</p>
<p>Dozens of police in riot gear were positioned between the barricades and the embassy, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The Berlin court on Thursday said Iran's political leadership ordered the killings of four Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in 1992.</p>
<p>It avoided names but said the assassinations were ordered by a secret special operations committee whose members included Iran's president, religious leader, intelligence minister and head of foreign policy.</p>
<p>Iran has repeatedly denied all responsibility for the killings, which it blames on infighting among groups opposed to the Tehran government.</p>
<p>The ruling has sparked an international diplomatic row, with Germany, Sweden and Australia recalling their ambassadors from Iran and the EU inviting other members to join the action.</p>
<p>Tehran also withdrew its envoy from Bonn and expelled four German diplomats after Germany asked four Iranian diplomatic staff to leave.</p>
<p>Germany has been Iran's largest trading partner and most important Western friend.</p>
