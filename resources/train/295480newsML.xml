<p>Six deputies who this week quit Poland's largest parliamentary opposition party, said on Thursday they would form a new right-wing group to challange the ruling ex-communists in this year's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the group will initiate the crystallisation of a strong, right-wing Christian party,&quot; one of the deputies, Bronislaw Komorowski, told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said the new party, to be set up on Sunday by the six and by members of two small right-wing groups, would join an opposition electoral bloc gathered around the Solidarity trade union, the Solidarity Election Action (AWS).</p>
<p>&quot;The electorate wants to have a broad political bloc which will be capable of beating parties rooted in communism,&quot; Komorowski said.</p>
<p>He said his old party -- the Union for Freedom (UW) which included two former prime ministers, Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Hanna Suchocka -- was increasingly weak.</p>
<p>&quot;The Union for Freedom has become isolated and fragmented ...and we ceased to understand its strategic goals,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Union, which groups some of the intellectuals who advised Solidarity during its fight for democracy before the 1989 fall of communism, led coalition governments which implemented most of Poland's market reforms.</p>
<p>But recent opinion polls have suggested it can count only on about 10 percent of the vote in elections due late this year.</p>
<p>The AWS is supported by around 20 percent, more than the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) which has been sharing power with a Peasant party since 1993.</p>
<p>Komorowski also said that the Union, declaring itself a centrist party, might have no choice but to form a coalition with the ex-communists after the elections, which he and his political colleagues would never accept.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to be suspected of being able to accept a compromise between the Union and the ex-communists,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ex-communists have repeatedly tried to draw the Union into a coalition, saying the groups share liberal economic views and share the quickest possible integration with the European Union as their strategic goal.</p>
<p>The AWS has a strongly pro-Church, anti-abortion platform and advocates removing ex-communists from many posts in administration and the economy.</p>
<p>The Union, while including convinced Catholics, is more secular in its approach and many of its members fear the radical anti-communist attitudes of the AWS could harm smooth economic reforms. -- Marcin Grajewski +48 22 653 9700</p>
