<p>Hong Kong stocks rose sharply in Wednesday morning trade, with the Hang Seng index advancing more than 200 points within the first few minutes of trade after benign U.S. inflation data calmed interest rate fears.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index was up 211.37 points at 13,505.24.</p>
<p>Turnover was HK$2.49 billion after the first 40 minutes of trade.</p>
<p>Brokers said local investors were encouraged by a modest rise of 0.1 percent in the core rate of the U.S. December consumer price index, which drove the U.S. long bond up one full point overnight to yield 6.77 percent and the Dow industrials up 53.11 points to 6,762.29.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to do with consumer prices in the States along with interest rates heading in the right direction,&quot; said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the focus is on the property sector and finance sector, which are the big cap leaders. Investors are just focusing on liquidity right now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings was up HK$4.00 at HK$174.50 and Hang Seng Bank advanced HK$1.00 to HK$94.50. Bank of East Asia was up HK$0.50 at HK$36.50.</p>
<p>In the property sector, Sun Hung Kai Properties jumped HK$3.00 to HK$94.00 and Henderson Land was up HK$1.50 at HK$73.75.</p>
<p>&quot;Property stocks have been oversold,&quot; said Geoff Galbraith, institutional sales trader at Nava SC Securities.</p>
<p>Great Eagle Holdings is due to release its final results on Wednesday. The stock was up HK$0.50 at HK$33.60.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was also awaiting the outcome of the government's first land auction of the year later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the auction results will be quite satisfactory and will help restore some confidence in the property counters,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
