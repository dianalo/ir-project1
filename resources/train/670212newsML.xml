<p>There are 13 days to go before the British colony reverts to China. These are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press. The views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters.</p>
<p>-- MING PAO said the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong garrison should soon set up a public relations system to adapt to a new environment where media monitoring is considered important. If the PLA refuses to be monitored by the media, the army's reputation in the territory will be badly damaged, the paper said.</p>
<p>-- SING TAO said because the British colonial government put too much stress on a free economy, it had failed to do enough to curb property market speculation. After Hong Kong's return to the mainland, the Special Administrative Region government may take some different measures to solve people's housing problem. There were many effective ways to bring down property prices, such as increasing land suplly and building more public housing, so that prices of private housing can be stablised. The SAR government should find a new balance between a free market economy and reasonable property prices, the paper said.</p>
<p>-- The English-language SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST said that imported labour had played a vital role in Hong Kong's economic success. But employers risked arousing serious social discontent if they persisted with proposals to import more cheap labour, since community sentiment was strongly against allowing workers to &quot;steal&quot; local jobs. Any changes must be limited and gradual, the paper said.</p>
<p>-- The Beijing-funded WEN WEI PO says China's Hong Kong policies and its support for the Hong Kong government and people in the 13 years since the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed had ensured a peaceful transition. It said the policies had also proved the Chinese government is sincere and determined in carrying out the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle.</p>
