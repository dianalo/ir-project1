<p>European debt markets tumbled early on Friday, following a sharp overnight drop in U.S. Treasuries on words of caution from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, brokers said. &quot;The sell-off is all on the back of Greenspan's comments,&quot; said Jonathan York, a futures broker at Cater Allen here.</p>
<p>Greenspan said the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up damaging the economy.</p>
<p>At 0830 GMT, March German Bund futures on LIFFE were down 41 basis points at 100.29 after crumpling to a low of 99.87 at the open. March gilt futures slid 25/32 to 108-31 while March Italian bond futures dropped 93 basis points to 127.68. In Paris, March notionnel were down 0.62 at 128.60.</p>
<p>Those losses followed a drop in the benchmark U.S. 30-year bond of as much as 2-1/2 points in New York and Tokyo trading, with much of the selling coming in Asian dealings, traders said.</p>
<p>Jitters before key November jobs data also infected the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>Though the long bond steadied in London, trading at 98-29 at 0843 GMT, for a yield of 6.584, compared with 98-16 in Tokyo and 99-29 at New York's close on Thursday, analysts expected more downward pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;As it is this morning, it's going to be absolute carnage out there,&quot; York said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of longs out there who came in and saw Treasury bonds way down,&quot; he said. &quot;The market is very nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>March T-bond futures were at 113-12 in automated trade, down 23/32 from Chicago's daily pit settlement on Thursday.</p>
<p>Treasuries trailed on European spreads, with the gap between the yield on 10-year U.S. and German bonds yawning to 57 basis points from 51 at the end of European trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kirit Shah, chief market strategist at Sanwa International in London, said Greenspan was trying to squelch recent market expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan was underlining the fact the spread between the real economy and the financial markets was just too wide,&quot; he said. &quot;He is trying to tell the markets to get real.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the overnight sell-off compounded general nervousness about U.S. non-farm payroll figures due at 1330 GMT on Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was going to be a nervous enough day as it was without the overnight fall,&quot; York said.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey of economists forecasts 179,000 new non-farm payrolls in November versus a 210,000-rise, previously. The unemployment was expected to remain steady at 5.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is obviously going to be interested to see what these unemployment numbers are,&quot; said Mark Bays, futures broker at Mees Pierson Derivatives in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if you saw a lower unemployment number, people would use that as a reason to sell the market off again,&quot; said Bays, adding that investors were eager to take profits as the year-end approached. &quot;I don't see a great deal of upside.&quot;</p>
<p>Bays said U.S. stock markets would be crucial.</p>
<p>&quot;If money comes out of the stock market to support the bond market then, I don't think we've got further to go,&quot; he said.</p>
