<title>JAPAN: Russia spot palladium sales possible - Japan traders.</title>
<headline>Russia spot palladium sales possible - Japan traders.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-03-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Japanese traders said on Thursday it was possible that Russia could soon resume sales of palladium and platinum in the spot market.</p>
<p>But they added there has been no word yet from the Russian platinum group export agency (Almaz) on when Japan-Russia export contract talks for platinum group metals will be held.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not heard any word from Almaz yet as to when the platinum talks will be held,&quot; a trading house trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is quite possible that Russia will resume selling metals in the spot market sometime soon after its budget for 1997 was passed and the overhaul of the government was announced,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;They probably want to sell quickly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The traders are still awaiting word from Russia, but said expectations that a trade mission will come to Japan soon have grown since the Russian budget was passed and President Boris Yeltsin announced a cabinet shake-up on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Japan-Russia export contract talks, usually held in mid-December, have been suspended due to internal Russian problems.  </p>
<p>A Russian trade official in Tokyo declined to comment on a news agency report on Wednesday that Russian palladium shipments to Japan may resume by the end of March.</p>
<p>Palladium futures fell sharply in New York overnight on the reports.</p>
