<p>Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at Palestinians stoning them at the West Bank town of Bethlehem on Saturday in a tenth day of protests against Jewish settlement construction in Arab East Jerusalem, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said dozens of Palestinians stoned the soldiers guarding a Jewish shrine at the outskirts of the Palestinian self-rule enclave in Bethlehem. The soldiers also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.</p>
<p>One Palestinian was wounded by a rubber bullet.</p>
<p>Peace moves between the Palestinians and Israel plunged into crisis this month after Israel broke ground on the settlement and an Islamist suicide bombing in Tel Aviv that killed three Israelis.</p>
<p>Israel says Arafat gave militants the impression they had a green light to carry out attacks. The Authority denies the charge.</p>
<p>Palestinians see building in Jerusalem as preempting negotiations that are to be held on its status in final peace talks which have yet to resume.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority on Saturday rejected Israeli conditions for resuming peace negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;What is needed is the implementation of the agreements and the return to the negotiating table without any preconditions or restrictions,&quot; Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said in Gaza as Arafat returned from Cairo.</p>
<p>&quot;The new Israeli conditions are not acceptable.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after meeting U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross on Friday that only a sustained Palestinian crackdown on &quot;terrorism&quot; -- not just a pledge to fight militants -- would salvage peacemaking.</p>
<p>Netanyahu demanded Arafat arrest militants, dismantle guerrilla groups and tighten cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. He denied Ross asked Israel to make any reciprocal gesture.</p>
