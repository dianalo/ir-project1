<p>Can Grow Biz International Inc. do for used wedding gowns and power tools what it has done for second-hand computers and compact disks?</p>
<p>Company President Ronald Olson thinks so.</p>
<p>&quot;The consumer has changed,&quot; Olson said. &quot;I think recycling ... helped us mentally to think about glass and aluminum cans and newspapers, going right into sporting goods and musical instruments.&quot;</p>
<p>Minneapolis-based Grow Biz is capitalising on a more frugal consumer's willingness to buy, sell and trade used merchandise that still has a lot of useful life and value.</p>
<p>The company develops and franchises retail stores that buy and sell new or used merchandise.</p>
<p>Grow Biz has five retail chains that sell second-hand merchandise, including Play It Again Sports, selling used sporting goods; Once Upon A Child, children's merchandise; Computer Renaissance, computers; Disc Go Round, compact disks, and Music Go Round, musical instruments.</p>
<p>With 1996 sales of $91.5 million, Grow Biz is a small fish in the large retail ocean. But in terms of second-hand merchandising, it is the first major chain with a national presence, analysts say.</p>
<p>Grow Biz stores also take a more professional view of merchandising, with product displays, than the usual second-hand store or charity thrift shop.</p>
<p>&quot;If we were to look at other opportunities, which we think there are, used tools seem to be a logical business,&quot; Olson said. &quot;Books seem to be logical ... We've looked at wedding gowns. We've looked at high-end couture women's (apparel).&quot;</p>
<p>He added, &quot;I think we can grow a concept much faster by going out and finding a concept that someone has developed and ... expanding it through our marketing and management.&quot;</p>
<p>Grow Biz recently agreed to buy a sixth retail group -- Video Game Exchange, a 40-unit chain that handles used video games and equipment. The chain will be renamed It's About Games.</p>
<p>Several new protype It's About Games stores will open in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area this summer and Olson said earlier in July that the company sees about 1,000 franchised game stores in its future.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they're anywhere near saturation,&quot; said Kinnard Investments analyst Tom Emmel. &quot;I think Grow Biz is really ahead of the curve. I think reselling is really coming into its own.&quot;</p>
<p>As of March 29, Grow Biz had 1,158 stores in operation in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>The fastest-growing and most profitable of the Grow Biz concepts, Emmel said, is Computer Renaissance as more families look to add a second home personal computer.</p>
<p>Olson said Computer Renaissance will open 88 stores this year to end 1997 with 200 units.</p>
<p>He added that there is still growth potential for its largest concept, Play It Again Sports, which has over 700 stores. Expanding into secondary markets, this chain is expected to grow to 1,000 stores over the next five years.</p>
<p>Olson said he believes that most of Grow Biz's second-hand store concepts have the potential to grow to 1,000 stores, based in part on an increased consumer acceptance of quality, second-hand merchandise.</p>
<p>The company is publically traded on Nasdaq. Its stock traded Wednesday at $10.50, unchanged, on volume of 3,300 shares.</p>
