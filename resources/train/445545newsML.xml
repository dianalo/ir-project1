<p>Nightlong celebrations stretched well into Sunday in rebel-held eastern Zaire after the fall of Kisangani, Zaire's third largest city and site of a big army garrison.</p>
<p>In poor districts of the eastern border town of Goma, the rebel headquarters, frenzied traditional drumming boomed out on Saturday evening as news spread of the greatest success to date of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL).</p>
<p>&quot;Only now do we really feel we are safe. We know that the Alliance is winning and we know there is no way the army will return to Goma,&quot; said businessman Moise Katembo.</p>
<p>After five months of civil war, the fall of Kisangani is the biggest blow so far to ailing president Mobutu Sese Seko -- who for years had ruled the vast nation at the heart of Africa with an iron grip.</p>
<p>Kisangani residents said by telephone rebels swept almost unopposed into the city centre on Saturday after terrified Zairean soldiers looted what they could and fled west across the Zaire River.</p>
<p>Goma, one of the first towns to fall, has been under rebel control since November, becoming the seat of veteran guerrilla leader Laurent Kabila and his parallel administration.</p>
<p>Fear of a threatened government counter-offensive by Mobutu's army has dogged Goma's inhabitants since jets, based in Kisangani, bombed the town of Bukavu, 150 km (95 miles) to the south in February.</p>
<p>&quot;At least this can give us some confidence to invest, to do business and to live our lives without fear. We have waited for this for 30 years,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we have to hope that the new leaders will not take on the ways of the old.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite vast potential mineral riches, Zaire is one of the world's poorest countries with corruption and mismanagement eating away at all levels of society.</p>
<p>The rebellion, launched in October by ethnic Tutsis threatened with expulsion to neighbouring Rwanda, broadened its popular base as the rebel fighters overran at least a fifth of the country.</p>
<p>The Zaire army, backed by foreign mercenaries and Hutus of the former Rwandan army accused of genocide at home, has been steadily rolled back 500 km (300 miles) through the jungle from Goma.</p>
<p>&quot;Kisangani was the symbol of the threatened counter-offensive, the stronghold of the army. We wanted to demystify the idea that mercenaries were strong and could defend it,&quot; Kabila told a news conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>Amid a fug of sweat, beer fumes and loud Zairean music, Goma's top nightclub was packed on Saturday night despite imposing special entry fees. In a town deep in poverty, civil servants are not paid and trade has been squashed by the war.</p>
<p>Despite the chaos and the collapse of most normal trade, the supply of beer has continued from the local brewery.</p>
<p>&quot;I just had to come out to celebrate the fall of Kisangani, there was no choice,&quot; said Mariam Kambale, who had paid the five dollar entry fee to the Coco Jambo -- even though it meant she couldn't afford to buy a drink.</p>
