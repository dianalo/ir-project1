<p>The Senate was expected to sustain President Bill Clinton's veto of the so-called &quot;partial birth&quot; abortion bill on Thursday, amid signs abortion rights supporters are increasingly edgy about the emotional issue.</p>
<p>Both Democrats and Republicans said on Wednesday they expected the Senate to uphold Clinton's veto, although a handful of lawmakers who initially voted against the bill may change position on the contentious election-year issue.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives narrowly voted to override the veto last week. The bill passed the Senate 54-44 in December, well short of the two-thirds majority needed for a veto override.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called the vote an uphill battle, but added &quot;it could get to be a lot closer than people thought&quot; as lawmakers switched sides.</p>
<p>&quot;Partial birth&quot; abortion, technically called dilation and evacuation, is sometimes used in later-term abortions. Under the technique a foetus is partially delivered feet first until just the head remains in the birth canal. The brains are then suctioned out and the skull collapsed.</p>
<p>The legislation -- the first time Congress has moved to ban a specific abortion technique -- represents a turning point in the abortion debate from generalities to a graphic focus on the details of specific techniques.</p>
<p>The emotional debate; intense opposition by the Catholic Church, which sent millions of postcards to Congress; and recent news articles showing it may be used more often than originally claimed, seem to be having an impact.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, who voted against the original bill, said he had promised fellow Democrats he would try to work out a compromise measure after Thursday's vote.</p>
<p>Daschle said he had no objection to banning the procedure for elective abortions where there was no health problem, but wanted to ensure it would be available when medically needed.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no reservations about prohibiting the practice for purposes of just mere convenience, but we do believe that there are very vital, very important health issues that have to be addressed,&quot; said Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat.</p>
<p>&quot;I have made a commitment ... to see if we can't work out language that would be suitable on all sides, and come back and pass this bill 100-0 next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Abortion opponents call the health exception a loophole to let the abortions continue and quote a coalition of physicians who contend there is no medical reason for the procedure.</p>
<p>Further, they point to recent newspaper articles indicating the technique may be used more frequently than previously believed and in second-trimester abortions where there is no health problem with the woman or foetus.</p>
<p>&quot;We aren't coming back next year and working out (any) compromise,&quot; said Andrea Sheldon, director of government affairs for the Traditional Values Coalition.</p>
<p>Abortion rights groups initially estimated the technique was used about 500 times a year, mainly in cases of severe foetal abnormalities.</p>
<p>&quot;Many senators who voted against the ban in December are becoming uncomfortable as they see their rationale unravel,&quot; said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee.</p>
<p>When Clinton vetoed the bill in April, he said he had concerns about the procedure but could not sign it because it did not include constitutional protections for a woman's health.</p>
<p>The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League challenged news reports saying the total was higher.</p>
<p>&quot;We're getting all caught up in the numbers ... and we're allowing the other side to distract us,&quot; said NARAL president Kate Michelman who called the bill &quot;an unprecedented intrusion into medical practice&quot; that would endanger women's health.</p>
<p>According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, nearly 90 perecent of the 1.5 million U.S. abortions each year take place in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
