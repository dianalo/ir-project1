<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures turned narrowly mixed early Friday in moderate trade, as strong buying on the open amid reports of firmer physical prices gave way to some pre-weekend profit taking.</p>
<p>At 1205 EDT, May was up 0.3 cent at $2.125 per million British thermal units after rallying early to $2.18. June was up the same at $2.14. Others were narrowly mixed.</p>
<p>&quot;The locals (bought) jumped on it early because of the cash, but people are taking profits now. To be honest, I don't think the fundamentals support these prices,&quot; said one East Coast trader.  </p>
<p>Traders said the recent move up defied some expectations this month that comfortable storage and prospects for milder spring weather would limit any upside.</p>
<p>But most still expected a pullback near-term, now that normal to above normal weather will arrive and spreads have flattened.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we could trade down for a couple of weeks, then get a seasonal rally (when cooling loads kick in),&quot; said one Houston-based trader.</p>
<p>&quot;With the spreads so tight now, it no longer makes sense to inject early,&quot; a trader said, noting the steep carry early in the month triggered unexpectedly-good injection demand.</p>
<p>Temperatures for much of the U.S. are expected to run near to slightly above normal into next week.</p>
<p>Technical traders pegged important support in June at $2.03 and then along the short-term up trendline in the $2.00 area. Resistance was seen at $2.24 and then in the $2.33 area.</p>
<p>In the cash, Henry Hub swing prices firmed five to 10 cents to near the $2.20 level, with May Gulf Coast gas up a nickel to the teens. April Midcon gas held relatively steady in the mid-$1.90s, with May on the same pipes up slightly to the mid-$1.90s or higher. April gas in New York gained more than five cents to the mid-$2.40s, while May city gate was up a couple of cents to the mid-$2.40s.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 17,648 Hub contracts traded at 1135 EDT. Hub open interest on April 24 fell 7,122 contracts to 188,947.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, May gained 2.5 cents to $1.98, while deferreds were mixed. The East/West spread narrowed by 2.2 cents to 14.5 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT open interest on April 24 rose 93 lots to 2,562.</p>
<p>KCBT May natgas expires today.</p>
