<p>U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday portrayed Vincent &quot;The Chin&quot; Gigante as an iron-fisted crime boss who banned mobsters from saying his name and who checked into hospitals to avoid arrest.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Weissmann carefully detailed the 21-count indictment against Gigante in closing arguments in the Brooklyn federal murder and racketeering trial of the alleged boss of the Genovese crime family.</p>
<p>In response, defence attorneys for Gigante said the government relied on mob informants -- &quot;stone-cold killers&quot; and &quot;psychopathic monsters&quot; -- to testify against their client.</p>
<p>Six mobsters-turned-informants testified, as did a dozen law enforcement agents, during 19 days of testimony.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Jack Weinstein was expected to give the jury its instructions on Wednesday morning and deliberations were expected to begin later in the day. The prosecution and defence rested their cases on Monday.</p>
<p>Gigante is charged with ordering seven murders, plotting to kill three other people, rigging business bids and extortion.</p>
<p>His attorneys, who did not call any witnesses in the trial, say he is incapacitated by mental illness. Gigante is known for wandering the neighbourhood around his Greenwich Village apartment in a tattered bathrobe.</p>
<p>But authorities say he feigns mental illness to avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>&quot;Vincent Gigante didn't want people to use his name, he wants to be an invisible man, he wants to be erased, but you can't erase yourself in the minds and more importantly in the tongues of your co-conspirators,&quot; Weissmann said.</p>
<p>Gigante, sitting in a wheelchair, looked more alert than usual. He looked at the jury and at one point smoothed down his hair.</p>
<p>His attorneys argued that the informants were witnesses willing to modify their testimony to serve the government.</p>
<p>&quot;What the government is asking you to do is to believe the uncorroborated testimony of the six murdering psychopaths,&quot; said the lead defence attorney, Michael Marinaccio, in his closing argument. &quot;These six spent a lifetime lying.&quot;</p>
<p>Marinaccio also displayed a chart of the 50 murder victims of the six informants.</p>
<p>He argued that none of the government's audiotapes linked Gigante to any of the charges in the indictment and said there are no photos of Gigante with any of the informants.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's case amounts to little more than throwing mud at the wall and seeing what sticks,&quot; he said.</p>
