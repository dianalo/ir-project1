<headline>Spain will thank its military one day - Gonzalez.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1996-10-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Socialist leader Felipe Gonzalez, in his first live interview since losing power in May, avoided questions about a &quot;dirty war&quot; on ETA rebels on Thursday and said Spaniards would one day thank the military for their restraint.</p>
<p>Looking tense and weary in the first major television appearance since the end of his 13-year rule, the former prime minister declined comment on a pending Supreme Court decision over whether to question him about the illegal 1983-87 drive against ETA, which killed 28 people.</p>
<p>&quot;Spain, the democratic Spain, will thank the security forces or the armed forces with hindsight for their extraordinarily respectful and self-restrained behaviour during that period, in spite of the enormous provocations they endured,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) has killed nearly 800 people in a campaign for independence begun in 1968. Civil Guard members and policemen are its favourite targets.</p>
<p>Gonzalez, who rejects charges by former subordinates that he authorised the &quot;dirty war&quot;, denied being hamstrung as opposition leader but described as unfortunate his own statements last month when he labelled the 28 murders as &quot;incidents&quot;.</p>
<p>Those comments, and his denial that Spain had engaged in state terrorism under his rule, prompted the new conservative government's number two to accuse him of &quot;bodeguilla terrorism&quot; -- a reference to the wine cellar in his official residence where he entertained friends and hatched strategies with aides.</p>
<p>Gonzalez declined to be drawn on this charge or on whether purported military files leaked to the local press since last year supported the &quot;dirty war&quot; allegations against him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not up to me to pass judgment on that,&quot; he said. &quot;It's up to the judges, and it's in their hands.&quot;</p>
<p>The papers are not available to the courts because Gonzalez's successor, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, has turned down their requests to declassify the files -- a decision the Socialist leader praised on Thursday as a responsible move.</p>
<p>Gonzalez's first interior minister and a top general in the paramilitary Civil Guard are on trial in connection with the illegal series of bombings, kidnappings, torture and murder, with a one-third share of mistaken identities.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to announce on November 4 whether it wants to question Gonzalez about the &quot;dirty war&quot; as a witness, as a suspect -- or not at all.</p>
<p>Last year, before being forced to call early elections over mounting &quot;dirty war&quot; charges and corruption scandals, Gonzalez denounced in parliament an undefined conspiracy against him.</p>
<p>Asked on Thursday whether he believed that was still afoot, he replied: &quot;Who knows.&quot;</p>
