<p>Socialist Lionel Jospin agreed to form a new government on Monday after French voters humiliated President Jacques Chirac and swept the left to power, raising fresh questions over Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>The Gaullist president saw his greatest political gamble backfire when voters kicked out the centre-right government in snap parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Chirac had called the polls 10 months early to seek a friendly majority in parliament for the rest of his seven-year term until 2002.</p>
<p>Instead, he now faces five years of power-sharing or &quot;cohabitation&quot; with Jospin, his ideological rival and the man he beat for the presidency in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The president of the republic offered to appoint me as prime minister. I accepted,&quot; Jospin told reporters on the steps of the presidential palace after a 55-minute meeting with Chirac. He said he planned to form a government &quot;quickly, this week&quot;.</p>
<p>Sunday's result shifted European politics further to the left, exactly a month after Britain's Labour Party scored a landslide election victory to end 18 years of Conservative rule.</p>
<p>The French, preoccupied with record unemployment, punished Chirac at the ballot box for broken promises on jobs and taxes. They spurned his call for a &quot;new elan&quot; to prepare for a single European currency from January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The Socialists generally favour the planned single currency, the euro, but will rely for their parliamentary majority on Communists who oppose it.</p>
<p>Jospin has also ruled out further austerity to meet qualifying targets for the euro. Party spokesman Francois Hollande confirmed the Socialists wanted to renegotiate the European Union's &quot;stability pact&quot; limiting budget deficits after the currency's launch.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to have assurances the stability pact does not signify new austerity in France,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, insisted that economic and monetary union (EMU) would go ahead as planned under the EU's Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;Germany and France remain for me the most important partners. We want to go further in Europe. The euro can be launched under strict adherence to the criteria and the planned timetable,&quot; Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel declared.</p>
<p>Financial markets were less certain. Forty market makers, economists and political analysts polled by Reuters put the chances of the euro starting on time at 72 percent -- down from 82 percent on May 14.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel EMU will still go ahead, but the uncertainty has increased,&quot; said David Brickman, European economist at Japanese securities house Yamaichi.</p>
<p>Laxer qualifying standards for the single currency would increase the chances of a weaker euro with a wider membership from the outset, including countries such as Spain and Italy. That could mean higher interest rates in Europe, economists said.</p>
<p>Edgar Meister, a board member of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, said the voyage towards EMU may enter &quot;rougher waters&quot; in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank is itself embroiled in a row with the Bonn government over revaluation of German gold reserves to help meet Maastricht targets.</p>
<p>The uncertainty pushed the U.S. dollar higher.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't know how this is going to play out so they're saying give me dollars, sterling, yen, Swiss francs -- anything that isn't involved in EMU,&quot; said Nigel Morgan, economic strategist at Old Mutual Portfolio Managers.</p>
<p>The Paris stock market was down three percent at one point, but bounced strongly to close 0.68 percent higher on huge turnover. French government bonds also clawed their way higher after initial falls.</p>
<p>The Socialists want to halt privatisations of companies like France Telecom or Air France. They have pledged to create 700,000 jobs for young people, half of them in the public sector, over the next three years, and to cut the working week from 39 hours to 35 over five years without loss of pay.</p>
<p>But the Communists want much faster action on both pledges, as well as wage hikes for the low paid.</p>
<p>The Socialists confirmed they wanted all left-wing parties, including the Communists, to join a new government. The Communists said they wanted in principle to join a Socialist-led cabinet but were trying to win policy commitments from Jospin.</p>
<p>Final results showed the Socialists and their allies won 274 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly and the Communists 38. The ecologists entered parliament for the first time with seven seats.</p>
<p>The outgoing centre-right coalition, which had held 464 seats in the outgoing Assembly, crashed to 256, while the far-right National Front won one.</p>
<p>It is the third time in 11 years that French voters have condemned their leaders to awkward power-sharing between a president and prime minister of opposing parties.</p>
<p>In two previous spells of &quot;cohabitation&quot;, from 1986 to 1988 and from 1993 to 1995, the late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand claimed pre-eminence in foreign affairs and left day-to-day domestic policy to centre-right governments.</p>
