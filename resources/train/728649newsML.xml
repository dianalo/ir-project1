<title>RUSSIA: Russia keen on Iraqi oil contracts, no deals yet.</title>
<headline>Russia keen on Iraqi oil contracts, no deals yet.</headline>

<p>Russia, aiming to secure big chunk of Iraqi oil exports as Baghdad prepares for a second round of deliveries to world markets, is waiting in the wings to sign contracts as soon as a price formula is set.</p>
<p>Yuri Agababov, deputy general director of Zarubezhneft, the Moscow-based company coordinating all purchases by Russian firms, said on Tuesday Russia could sign no contracts until pricing had been agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything will depend on how the formula is set and until that happens, there is very little to talk about,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he reaffirmed the eagerness of Russian companies to secure a major portion of the deals.</p>
<p>No pro-forma agreements had been set during a recent trip to Baghdad but Russian firms had expressed strong interest in exporting Iraqi crude, he said.</p>
<p>Eight Russian producers and oil industry companies bought nearly 28.54 billion barrels of Iraqi oil under the first programme, or 23.4 percent of the 121.6 million barrels Baghdad exported under that first, 180-day deal.</p>
<p>Agababov said the original eight companies would participate in the second round and said newcomers could join them. But competition for contracts would be fierce and not everyone would come away with a deal.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody wants to get involved this time -- name a Russian oil producer and he's trying to get in on this,&quot; Agababov said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like a Fellini film -- lots of desire but not always the possibility for satisfying it. It's impossible to predict (the size of the contracts).&quot;</p>
<p>The United Nations finalised on Monday talks with Iraq on a food distribution programme, paving the way for Baghdad to resume oil exports possibly by early August for another six months to raise money for humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>Baghdad has made the completion of an aid distribution accord a condition for resuming the exports.</p>
<p>Agababov said Russian oil companies were ready to fly to Baghdad again as soon as the U.N. approved a pricing formula. The formula is likely to be set after the U.N. secretary-general approves the hand-out distribution plan, which Iraq said it would submit by July 21.</p>
<p>Iraq has said it expects exports to begin at around 740,000 barrels barrels per day (bpd), possibly rising to one million bpd, all up from the average 660,000 bpd seen under the first 180-day programme.</p>
<p>The U.N. programme allows the Gulf state to sell about $2.14 billion worth of oil over six months to raise cash for food and medicine and to pay reparations to Gulf War victims after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
