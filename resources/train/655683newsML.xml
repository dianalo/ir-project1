<p>Bulgaria's domestic debt rose by around 426 billion levs by June 9 to 2.984 trillion levs (corrects from 2.920 trillion levs) from 2.558 billion levs at end April mainly due to net sales of government securities, a central bank official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;(Domestic) debt rise between April 30 and June 9 was mainly due to net sales of government securities and weakening of the lev, which boosted the lev price of dollar-denominated treasury paper,&quot; Nikolina Micheva, head of State Credits department at the Bulgarian National Bank told Reuters.</p>
<p>Net sales of government securities within the period totalled around 155.2 billion levs and the lev rise against the dollar boosted by some 207.2 billion levs the lev value of dollar-denominated government securities.</p>
<p>The lev lost to 1,667.4 per dollar on June 9 from 1,450.0 on April 30 in the central bank daily fixing used in the calculations.</p>
<p>The lev traded near 1,680 per dollar on the local interbank market on Thursday.</p>
<p>Finance ministry's direct loans from the Bulgarian National Bank and the State Savings Bank rose by 64.3 billion levs to 204.5 billion levs by June 9, figures showed.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry placed in April $50 million of 18-month, floater coupon T-notes with the country's biggest state-owned Bulbank under a stabilisation plan for the ailing state Biochimbank.</p>
<p>The ministry issued $79.2 million of floater coupon T-bonds last year to guarantee foreign currency deposits of companies and individuals in five local banks against which the central bank has filed insolvency suits.</p>
<p>Bad debt bonds worth 32 billion levs and $1.8 billion respectively were issued three years ago to cover banks' non-performing loans extended to state companies before 1991.</p>
<p>The total par value of dollar-denominated bad debt bonds in circulation by June 9 was $917.6 million and lev-denominated bonds amounted to around 19.8 billion levs worth.</p>
