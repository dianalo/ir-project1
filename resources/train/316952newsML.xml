<title>USA: Methodist minister convicted of sexual misconduct.</title>
<headline>Methodist minister convicted of sexual misconduct.</headline>

<text>
<p>A prominent former Methodist minister was found guilty Friday of sexually exploiting women at his Texas church by using his power to push them into sex, fondling and lewd conversation.</p>
<p>A jury in Fort Worth, Texas found 70-year-old Barry Bailey guilty of sexual exploitation, gross negligence, reckless infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy, and awarded actual and punitive damages totalling about $3.5 million to the plaintiffs in the civil case.</p>
<p>Eight women and one of their husbands sought damages of over $16 million. The jury's complicated judgment found Bailey guilty of different offences with each woman.</p>
<p>Two women said the once widely-respected senior minister at the First United Methodist Church in Fort Worth used his authority as a counsellor to manipulate them into long-term sexual relationships. They were awarded almost $2 million between them.</p>
<p>The other women said Bailey had fondled them, pushed them into discussing masturbation and oral sex or had made sexually suggestive comments. Their awards varied; one of the women was awarded no damages at all.</p>
<p>All but two of the eight women were employees or members of Bailey's church, where he was senior minister for 18 years before the allegations forced him out in August 1994.</p>
<p>In testimony over 18 days, the women alleged that Bailey effectively cast a spell on them and took advantage of his position of power.</p>
<p>Ginger Pierson, a member of the church, calmly recounted to the court dozens of sexual encounters with Bailey over a decade after he became her counsellor. She said they had sex inside the church.</p>
<p>This case is not about sex ... This case is about power and vulnerability,&quot; plaintiffs' attorney Broadus Spivey told the jury of seven men and five women.</p>
<p>Bailey, who has been married for over 40 years, took the stand to deny the allegations against him. His attorneys accused the plaintiffs of lying to receive a &quot;lawsuit lottery&quot;.</p>
