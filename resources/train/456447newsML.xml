<p>With the opening of the Oklahoma City bombing trial only 11 days away, legal experts predict a contest between the prosecution's extensive physical evidence and a defendant who his lawyers say is the wrong man.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say their 22 months of investigation will prove that disgruntled Gulf War U.S. Army veteran Timothy McVeigh methodically planned and executed the explosion, which killed 168 people and injured hundreds of others.</p>
<p>They have found the shattered remains of the truck used to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995, and records and witnesses tying McVeigh to the truck's rental. They have also found chemical traces on his clothing and a knife linking him to the detonation cord. And they have phone records and two witnesses who will testify that he visited Oklahoma City to plan the attack.</p>
<p>What they do not have is a witness who can place McVeigh at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>McVeigh's chief lawyer, Stephen Jones, has likened the trial to a David vs. Goliath struggle. He has only one message -- his 28-year-old client is the wrong man.</p>
<p>He has not publicly disclosed his strategy but experienced defence lawyers say he could also argue that his client did many of the things the government said he did, but as a dupe in an international conspiracy whose aims he was not aware of.</p>
<p>McVeigh's cause has not been helped in recent weeks by reports in several publications that he made a confession to his own lawyers. When the first report surfaced, Jones denied his client had confessed and said the reported &quot;confession&quot; was a ruse designed to persuade a reluctant potential witness to speak with the defence.</p>
<p>&quot;The challenge that Jones has is explaining away a mountain of circumstantial evidence tying his client to almost all the relevant locations at the relevant times,&quot; said Robert Precht, director of the Public Service Laboratory at the University of Michigan Law School.</p>
<p>Precht said the defence could argue that McVeigh was an &quot;unwitting dupe&quot; in the bombing conspiracy. Under federal conspiracy laws, a person is not guilty if he did not know his acts were contributing to the crime, he said.</p>
<p>David Lane, a defence lawyer specialising in death penalty cases, says the wrong-man defence could be a winner for McVeigh. &quot;In an identification defence, you agree with 99 percent of the prosecution's case. It's just that they have the wrong guy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say McVeigh and co-defendant Terry Nichols, who will be tried separately, had strong anti-government views and were seeking to avenge an attack by federal agents on the Branch Davidian sect's compound in Waco, Texas, that led to nearly 100 deaths on April 19, 1993 -- exactly two years before the Oklahoma City blast.</p>
<p>McVeigh's trial, expected to last between three and four months, starts on March 31 with jury selection. It was transferred to Denver because the defence argued that he could not receive a fair trial in passion-inflamed Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>The government alleges that McVeigh and Nichols stole explosives from a storage locker in Marion, Kansas, around October 1994 and transported them to Kingman, Arizona. It says the defendants used aliases when they bought ammonium nitrate fertiliser and racing fuel to make the bomb that was loaded onto a rented truck at a lake in Kansas near Nichols' home.</p>
<p>Key prosecution witness Michael Fortier, who has already pleaded guilty to lesser charges in exchange for his testimony, will testify that he and McVeigh drove to Oklahoma City where they identified the federal bulding as their target. His wife, Lori, is also expected to testify.</p>
