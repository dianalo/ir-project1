<p>France's two fractious centre-right parties are debating a proposal to merge as they lick their wounds from a surprise election defeat, but early reactions only exposed their divisions.</p>
<p>The idea to merge the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR), founded by President Jacques Chirac, and the Union for French Democracy (UDF) is nothing new.</p>
<p>But it gained fresh impetus as the conservatives, battered in last June's poll, seek ways of regaining power from the left and countering the rise of the far-right National Front.</p>
<p>Gaullist Patrick Labaune, mayor of the southern town of Valence who lost his parliamentary seat, revived the proposal earlier this month, seizing on the quiet holiday period to give it more impact.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the reasons for our defeat is that voters are fed up with our internal fighting...I propose closer union between the RPR and the UDF,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The mixed response he received showed unity was still far away, with the UDF, the alliance's junior partner, generally more favourable to a merger.</p>
<p>&quot;Merging two weakened bodies won't make a healthy one,&quot; RPR spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said.</p>
<p>At stake is the outcome of a general election that Chirac might call well ahead of the scheduled date in five years if his &quot;cohabitation&quot; with Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin turns sour, and of the presidential election also due in 2002.</p>
<p>The left-wing coalition of Socialists, Communists and Greens won 32.2 percent of the votes last June to the centre-right's 30.6 percent. The National Front won close to 15 percent although the electoral system which favours party alliances left it with only one seat in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The pro-RPR daily Le Figaro said the idea of a merger was being pushed behind the scenes by Chirac who was forced into sharing power with Jospin after he lost his disastrous election gamble to win a renewed parliamentary majority for the five remaining years of his seven-year term.</p>
<p>It said Chirac, under attack from some conservatives, wanted to ensure his leadership over the centre-right and pull the rug from under possible presidential rivals.</p>
<p>Chirac said in an interview last month that centre-right rivals must realise that they had no major differences on basic issues and their interest was to work towards unity.</p>
<p>While the UDF is regarded as generally more liberal and more pro-European than the RPR, differences have become blurred.</p>
<p>Fracture lines run between and within the two parties which were split over whether to support Chirac or his Gaullist rival Edouard Balladur in the 1995 presidential election.</p>
<p>They were also divided over the austerity policies led by Gaullist former premier Alain Juppe in order to comply with the Maastricht criteria to join the single European currency.</p>
<p>Following the election defeat, Juppe's socially-minded rival Philippe Seguin took over the RPR leadership in a coup mounted against Chirac's wishes and his associates have made clear they see him as a potential candidate to succeed Chirac as president.</p>
<p>Labaune said he was aiming his proposal at rank-and-file MPs as he was not expecting much support from party leaders -- who kept a cautious silence and left it to subordinates to react.</p>
<p>UDF MP Michel Maylan called the proposal &quot;realistic and sensible&quot;. &quot;The big leaders must give the go-ahead for a merger,&quot; he said. But UDF ex-foreign minister Herve de Charette said the real issue was to discuss policy rather than a merger.</p>
