<p>A Dutch peacekeeping soldier was wounded in a hand grenade attack on Bosnian Serb-controlled territory in the latest retaliation for a Western crackdown on indicted war criminals, NATO said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The soldier was hit in the groin by shrapnel and flown to a military hospital in Novi Travnik, where doctors reported he was in stable condition, NATO spokesman Major Peter Clarke said.</p>
<p>The soldiers were attacked on Wednesday evening after their armoured vehicle turned on its side on a muddy road in Kotor Varos, southeast of Banja Luka in the country's Serb Republic.</p>
<p>As the soldiers were trying to turn the armoured vehicle upright, two drunken men came out of a nearby house, Clarke said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of them threw a grenade in the direction of the soldiers, injuring one of the Dutch with shrapnel,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The man who lobbed the grenade ran away but was later detained by local Serb police. NATO officers said they could not call the incident an organised attack because the two men were intoxicated.</p>
<p>A wave of apparent revenge attacks against the multinational peace force and international agencies have followed a NATO raid this month on suspected war criminals.</p>
<p>In the eastern town of Bratunac, a United Nations pick-up truck was destroyed by rocket-propelled grenades early on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Two explosions in Bratunac resulted in the demolition of a U.N. vehicle,&quot; United Nations spokesman Alex Ivanko told Reuters, adding that no one was injured.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said one unexploded grenade was found at the scene, he said.</p>
<p>The pick-up truck was parked outside the apartment of an international police monitor. A Western official who asked not to be named said the monitor was a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>Since NATO pounced on two Serbs indicted for war crimes two weeks ago, hardline Serb nationalists have launched a low-level revenge campaign to protest against the alliance raid.</p>
<p>Small-scale explosions have damaged vehicles and apartments of monitors working for the international police and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is supervising local elections in Bosnia. No one has been killed in the attacks.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday strongly condemned the retaliation and called on Serb authorities to bring the culprits to justice.</p>
<p>A German newspaper reported on Wednesday that Germany, Britain and the United States were concerned about the safety of top government officials. It named Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German officials as being at risk.</p>
<p>Western officials say the campaign has been orchestrated by Serb hardliners loyal to wartime leader Radovan Karadzic who feel threatened by the tougher NATO policy towards war crimes suspects.</p>
<p>The attacks appear designed to discourage NATO from launching more arrest operations against suspects, including Karadzic, who have been indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</p>
<p>British soldiers seized and extradited one suspect and shot dead another who resisted arrest in the Prijedor region two weeks ago.</p>
