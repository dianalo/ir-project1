<headline>LIFFE coffee climbs back after March hits new low.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>London's robusta coffee contract crumbled to a new life low of $1,229 a tonne on Thursday as market players dumped long positions following a sharp speculator sell-off in the arabicas market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;New York sold off violently which brought in a bit of long liquidation and a few spec sellers. It is all inspired by arabicas...it's just spilled over into London,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;We've made a new low on the movement and the market is in a lot of trouble,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But March then found support at the lows at clawed its way higher to close at $1,234, down $26 on the day.</p>
<p>Traders continued to monitor the fortunes of the May/July spread after Wednesday's surprise Exchange announcement on the validity of grading certificates following its previous grading announcement in March.</p>
<p>May/July closed at a $10 discount after fluctuating in a choppy session. January was down $10 at $1,297 and total volume reached 7,984 lots.</p>
<p>New coffee grading criteria now apply to next year's July contract and subsequent delivery months, meaning that May coffee will have to be regraded.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who picks up coffee there is going to have to regrade it, they're going to have the expense and aggravation of that,&quot; the trader said. --Jeremy Smith, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064</p>
