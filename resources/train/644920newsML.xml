<p>Uzi Narkiss's thrill of victory on June 7, 1967 -- when Israeli troops captured Arab East Jerusalem -- was Salah Taamri's agony of defeat.</p>
<p>Today, the retired Israeli and Palestinian generals are united in fear the city whose fate has remained unresolved for the last 30 years could drag their peoples into more tragedy.</p>
<p>The spare, short Narkiss, 72, was in charge of Israeli army central command when its troops captured East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;After 2,000 years...I thought after all that I was the messenger of the Jewish people to liberate the wall,&quot; Narkiss said, referring to the Western Wall of the Jewish temple the Romans destroyed in AD 70, throwing the Jews into exile.</p>
<p>&quot;Euphoria, very difficult to describe. It's possible for poets not for someone like me,&quot; Narkiss told Reuters at his home in Jewish West Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Taamri, 54, was a student in Cairo studying English literature when he heard then Israeli defence minister Moshe Dayan, triumphant, speaking from East Jerusalem on the radio.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't even walk, I sat down on the stairs at the gate of the building just to regain control of myself,&quot; said Taamri after a Palestinian council session on Jerusalem in the West Bank self-rule enclave of Ramallah. &quot;My dreams were shattered.&quot;</p>
<p>The young Palestinian dropped his studies and became a Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) guerrilla, retiring as a brigadier-general to run in the first Palestinian elections for a legislative council in 1996.</p>
<p>Israel, in a move recognised only by Costa Rica and El Salvador, swiftly annexed East Jerusalem which had been under Jordanian rule since the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948.</p>
<p>FEAR OF NOT BEING ALLOWED BACK HOME AGAIN</p>
<p>It would be 27 years before Taamri, born in nearby Bethlehem, saw Jerusalem again. Israel allowed him to return under the landmark 1993 interim peace deal with the PLO.</p>
<p>That accord was signed by Israel's previous government, ousted by Benjamin Netanyahu in elections a year ago. Netanyahu opposed the peace deal. The prime minister opposes a Palestinian state and says he'll never cede any part of Jerusalem, a city holy to Jews, Christians and Moslems.</p>
<p>Taamri says now he hesitates to go abroad. &quot;There's still this serious fear I will not be able to come back&quot;.</p>
<p>Since the war, Israel has settled some 160,000 Jews in East Jerusalem, rivalling the number of Arabs there. About 70 percent of the entire city's population of 584,000 residents are Jews.</p>
<p>Narkiss said his euphoria was tempered by the interval of 30 years in a city that is as divided as ever, though the walls, barbed wire and machinegun nests that once split it are gone.</p>
<p>&quot;I think at that time I was very naive...The way I'm looking at things now, I do not see the solution,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>SEIZURE OF EAST JERUSALEM DIVIDED ISRAELIS</p>
<p>The war's results, he said, also ironically divided Israel into two camps.</p>
<p>&quot;One, that I believe in, says they were weak, we were strong, so we won. The other school of thought says, 'No, that was an act of God. That was a miracle',&quot; Narkiss said. &quot;I think it brings us a lot of harm because people become fanatics.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This government made a mistake by bringing up the question of Jerusalem...It's a pity, with the tunnel, with Har Homa,&quot; Narkiss, a supporter of the main opposition Labour party, said.</p>
<p>Last September unprecedented gun battles erupted between Israeli and Palestinian forces after Netanyahu had a second entrance punched into a tourist tunnel near Moslem holy sites in the city. Fifteen Israelis and 61 Palestinians were killed.</p>
<p>U.S. SHOULD ACT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE</p>
<p>Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state in the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>They were outraged when Netanyahu began a new Jewish settlement at a site Israel calls Har Homa in East Jerusalem in March, saying it pre-empted final status peace talks which have yet to resume since Netanyahu took office.</p>
<p>Peacemaking ground to a halt. U.S. and Egyptian mediation efforts have yet to end the crisis.</p>
<p>Taamri said before it was too late Washington, the sponsor of the peace process, had to stop Netanyahu from imposing facts in Jerusalem -- building settlements -- contradicting the spirit of the peace deal.</p>
<p>&quot;Many powers through the history of humanity who were more powerful than Israel didn't know where to stop. It was always this...that made them slip to their doom, taking part of the world with them. The Israelis are no exception,&quot; he said.</p>
