<p>CSCE cocoa futures rallied sharply on Thursday, as chart-driven speculative buying drove the key July contract to its highest settlement in six weeks, dealers said.</p>
<p>July futures surged $59 per tonne -- or about four percent -- on the day, to finish at $1,481, after trading between $1,483 and $1,423. Second-month September closed up $54, to $1,507, while the remaining months gained $53 to $57.</p>
<p>The market headed into positve territory at the opening, buoyed by trade buying in the back months, dealers said. Upward momentum accelerated after the July contract breached $1,438-$1,441 and then $1,450 resistance, activating a series of buy-stops, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was technical factors leading the market. $,1450 (basis July) was a key area of resistance,&quot; said Dean witter analyst Corey Bell.</p>
<p>Traders said the market may have received support from talk that the upcoming 1997/98 Ivorian main crop could be delayed due drought conditions earlier this year, which has kept soil moisture below optimum levels.</p>
<p>But Bell said any prediction for the 1997/98 harvest was premature.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumors about 1997/98 production may have stirred the market up,&quot; he said. &quot;It could be a factor, but it's very early. We find early rumors in this market are usually far off.&quot;</p>
<p>Additionally, talk the Ivory Coast mid-crop would not be as good as expected due to poor quality beans may have added fuel to the rally, traders said. And weather patterns suggesting dry weather could hit Brazil and Africa were also viewed as friendly.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said July's next upside target was a chart gap formed last month between $1,494 and $1,501.</p>
<p>Turnover was brisk, at an estimated 12,229 lots.</p>
