<title>SOUTH AFRICA: South African TV drama on apartheid praised.</title>

<p>A South African television drama about three boyhood friends won praise on Thursday as the most ambitious effort so far to capture the essence of life under apartheid.</p>
<p>The makers of &quot;Homeland&quot; hope their series will do far more than death-squad trials and truth commission hearings to help ordinary blacks and whites understand how apartheid operated and how it shaped each other's lives.</p>
<p>&quot;Homeland is the first English South African serial which really rubs at the national core, shaving away at the deceit and betrayal which have scarred the nation,&quot; the Johannesburg Star newspaper said.</p>
<p>The 13-part series that began on Wednesday spans three decades and shows how two white boys and their black friend from a rare mixed Johannesburg suburb grow up and are driven apart.</p>
<p>Director Neal Sundstrom said he saw the story as &quot;a catharsis for apartheid&quot;, and just a beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americans have made at least 40 movies about Vietnam and they still haven't exhausted the subject,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many South Africans, carefully segregated by race in all but a few &quot;grey&quot; neighbourhoods, remained largely ignorant about how people from other races lived.</p>
<p>The state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation, which brought television to the country in 1976, hopes to sell Homeland abroad.</p>
<p>Images from the first episode, helping to recreate the atmosphere on the early 1960s, included British singer Cliff Richard, hula-hoops and the Sharpeville massacre.</p>
