<p>Less than two months after threatening to self-destruct, the Czech Republic ice hockey team are full of confidence before their world title defence in Finland this week.</p>
<p>After capturing gold in the Vienna tournament last year, the Czechs fell on hard times, crashing out of the World Cup, including an embarrassing 7-1 loss to Germany.</p>
<p>A chorus of dissent among players, coaches and officials grew as the holders managed to win only three of 18 games, reaching a crescendo at the end of February when coach Ludek Bukac resigned after repeated calls for his removal.</p>
<p>Since becoming coach of the national team in 1994, Bukac had driven out many top players, but also guided the Czechs to their first world championship since the former Czechoslovakia won the last of its six titles in 1985.</p>
<p>But the coaching change so close to this year's tournament appears to have worked with the Czechs winning five of six games since as they prepared for Finland.</p>
<p>&quot;The atmosphere of the team is excellent. It can't be compared to that of the World Cup,&quot; said team captain Robert Reichel, who plays for the New York Islanders in the National Hockey League.</p>
<p>The Czechs peaked on Saturday with an impressive 6-3 defeat of Finland, the most goals the team have scored since they put nine past Italy in the first round of last year's championship.</p>
<p>If Bukac was considered the thinking man's coach, the new Czech coaching team of former NHLer Ivan Hlinka and ex-Calgary Flames assistant Slavomir Lener are considered players' coaches.</p>
<p>&quot;We are letting them play wide open hockey and for most of the games we are controlling the play. We are more active and are breaking very well...on the other hand, we have a few things to work out, mainly defensively,&quot; Lener said.</p>
<p>Not all of the Bukac-era tenets have been discarded.</p>
<p>The new coaches have taken a page from Bukac's play book by limiting the number of NHL players invited to the squad, even though it may mean missing out on including Pittsburgh Penguins' Jaromir Jagr and Petr Nedved in the lineup.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't be adding any more players, we are pleased and confident with the team we have,&quot; Lener said, echoing the sentiment of Bukac who felt the 1996 success was forged around a camraderie built over several weeks of training.</p>
<p>Reichel will be joined by San Jose Shark defenceman Vlastimil Kroupa as the only current NHL players on the team, though Robert Lang, Jiri Slegr and Vladimir Vujtek all have experience playing in North America.</p>
