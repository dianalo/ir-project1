<p>Belgium's employers federation has blamed the FGTB/ABVV socialist trade union for the failure of talks on wages and jobs for 1997-1998 between Belgian unions and employers.</p>
<p>&quot;The FGTB introduced elements which were inacceptable, giving totally different interpretations to those of the other partners and those of the government...,&quot; Tony Vandeputte, head of the FEB/VBO employers federation, told Belgian radio in an interview broadcast Wednesday.The talks broke down late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;In that situation all the partners decided it wasn't possible to have valid negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>The radio said the liberal and Christain unions also blamed the FGTB for the failure of the talks, with all sides angry that the socialist union had published a statement ahead of the talks laying out its own demands.</p>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene had given the unions and employers until the end of November to reach an agreement, otherwise the government would impose a deal on them.</p>
<p>Union and employer representatives met with Dehaene on Monday one week after a 24-hour strike by the socialist unions brought negotiations to a standstill.</p>
<p>A government-imposed two-year wage freeze ends on December 31. Unions and employers can agree on nation-wide wage rises in the private sector for the next two years as long as wages do not rise more than those of Belgium's three main trading partners -- Germany, France and the Netherlands.</p>
