<p>Service Corp International, the largest North American and European funeral home operator, will face a tough fight acquiring its Canadian rival Loewen Group Inc despite a rich $4.1 billion bid.</p>
<p>Service Corp, which built its empire in North America and Europe by buying small rivals, took Wall Street by surprise on Tuesday, when it took on industry number two Loewen with a $43 a share bid.  </p>
<p>Called a &quot;bear hug&quot; by takeover experts, the bid would pay Loewen holders $2.8 billion for their shares, plus another $1.3 billion in debt, for a total price tag of $4.1 billion, sources said.</p>
<p>But Loewen is expected to put up a fight. It has said it is reviewing the bid and an analyst said it has already called an emergency board meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no love lost between Ray Loewen and (Service Corp's) Bob Waltrip...It is not likely that Loewen is going to simply roll over. This is a hostile tender offer,&quot; said Chicago Corp analyst Steve Saltzman.  </p>
<p>Any potential deal could face several roadblocks. A combination needs the approval of 75 percent of voting Loewen holders. With a 15 percent stake owned by chairman Ray Loewen and insiders holding an additional three percent, this could prove difficult.</p>
<p>A poison pill with a 20 percent trigger and a staggered board are other opening defensive measures.</p>
<p>&quot;If there's a bona fide offer on the table and Loewen turns it down and Service Corp walks away -- the shareholders will be furious. Its not so easy to turn down due to the high valuations,&quot; said Dean Witter analyst Todd Richter.  </p>
<p>Loewen's stock has clawed its way back up in value after a nearly disastrous lawsuit in Mississippi brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. The stock price fell from a high last year of 41-3/4 to as low as 16-1/6.</p>
<p>It seemed to turn the corner in May, saying it had already completed $305 million in acquisitions and inked deals for another $196 million. The stock recovered some of its value and had moved up to 29-5/8 by about two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The market is skeptical about a deal. Loewen's stock price soared above Monday levels, but stayed below the $43 a share bid. Loewen rose 6-1/4 to 40. Service Corp fell 1/8 to 30-1/8.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm not surprised the stock is lower -- the arbs have been burned in the last year by acquistions that haven't gone through. But they don't know Service Corp. They have made hostile acquisitions of public companies in Europe. These are not fellows to be trifled with,&quot; Saltzman said.</p>
<p>Said Lynn Detrick, an analyst for Williams MacKay Jordan &amp; Co Inc: &quot;This would be a great fit and I expect Service Corp will be tenacious pursuing this. Although, they are very price conscious and would probably not complete a deal unless it would be additive.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts also played down potential antitrust concerns, saying the industry is still too fragmented for regulators to block the deal, although some divestitures would be expected.</p>
<p>&quot;The combined entity would still only have 16 to 17 percent of domestic market number of funeral homes,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Service Corp's traditional focus on metropolitan areas and Loewen's strategy in rural areas would also mean less overlap.</p>
<p>The divestitures could possibly create a short-term buying opportunity for other funeral services firms.</p>
<p>Shares of other death care companies rose. Equity Corp International hit a new year high of 33-1/8 in intraday trading, Stewart Enterprises rose 1-1/3 to 32-3/4, and Carriage Service Enterprises rose 1-1/8 to 20-3/4. JP Morgan is advising Service Corp International on the deal.</p>
