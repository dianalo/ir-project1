<p>Turkey's parliament on Wednesday voted to extend emergency rule in nine provinces in the southeast where security forces have been fighting a Kurdish insurgency for more than 12 years, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>MPs voted by 245 votes to 176 to extend emergency rule in the mainly Kurdish provinces for a further four months. Emergency rule, one step short of martial law, has been in place in the southeast since 1987.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who came to power in June, last year vowed to lift emergency rule completely but so far has failed to do so. Last fall parliament voted to remove one province from emergency rule after the military-dominated National Security Council gave its approval.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 people have died in in the conflict between the Turkish security forces and the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is fighting for independence or autonomy in the southeast.</p>
