<p>The last batch of Vietnamese boatpeople in Indonesia were repatriated on Monday from the remote island where they have been housed for years.</p>
<p>A total of 486 boat people peacefully boarded two Indonesian naval ships anchored off Galang Island, near Singapore, for a three-day journey to Vung Tau in Vietnam, military officials said.</p>
<p>Some women among the boatpeople were in tears but there were no protests as Indonesian police gently shepherded them on to barges which took them to the ships in driving rain.</p>
<p>Some were sick as the barges pitched and rolled in the choppy sea and had to helped on board the ships.</p>
<p>There, the boatpeople queued up before being allowed into the hold. Their possessions, bound in hessian sacks, were tagged and brought on board separately.</p>
<p>It was the last chapter of Indonesia's Orderly Repatriation Programme, under which the Vietnamese are sent home non-voluntarily.</p>
<p>Major-General Arif Kumaat, the officer-in-charge of the repatriation, said the operation was carried out peacefully because Indonesian authorities had used a conciliatory approach in persuading the boatpeople to leave.</p>
<p>&quot;We used a persuasive approach and we never used guns. We treated them like family,&quot; he told reporters on Galang, a small island dotted with scrub-covered hills.</p>
<p>He said the use of films to depict current conditions in Vietnam had persuaded many of the boatpeople to accept their repatriation with fortitude.</p>
<p>&quot;They didn't know life had changed and we showed them films every day,&quot; Kumaat said.</p>
<p>At its peak in the early 1990s, the Galang Island refugee camp held more than 10,000 boatpeople. On Monday, it was deserted, with desolate shacks within the perimeter nestled against abandoned churches and Buddhist shrines.</p>
<p>Eleven of the boatpeople have been registered as refugees and have been moved to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in nearby Tanjung Pinang. The rest have either been repatriated or accepted by third countries.</p>
<p>Indonesia plans to develop Galang and neighbouring islands as part of a special industrial zone tapping into growth in Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
<p>But the refugee camp and its shrines will be left untouched, said Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Habibie, who is in charge of development of the industrial zone.</p>
<p>The boatpeople started fleeing Vietnam, mostly in flimsy boats to neighbouring Southeast Asian nations, after the Communist victory in 1975. Their numbers were estimated at about 850,000 but many died at sea in maritime disasters and in attacks by pirates.</p>
<p>Some 100,000 have been returned to Vietnam since 1989, but hundreds of thousands have found refuge in third countries.</p>
<p>In June, the UNHCR ended funding for boatpeople camps across Asia with the exception of Hong Kong, where an estimated 13,000 are still awaiting repatriation.</p>
