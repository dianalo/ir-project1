<p>The Philippine agriculture sector grew by a robust 4.22 percent in the first quarter of this year, but analysts on Wednesday remained cautious on full-year prospects due to unpredictable weather conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us not fool ourselves, agriculture is subject to seasonal phenomena. Typhoon today, good weather tomorrow, drought the next day,&quot; said Joven Babaan, SBC Warburg analyst.</p>
<p>Agricultural production rose by 4.22 percent in the first three months of the year compared to a 3.04 percent contraction in the same period last year, according to adjusted figures from the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).</p>
<p>The agriculture department, however, said the sector posted 2.49 percent growth in first quarter last year.</p>
<p>Alvin Ang, an economist at All Asia Securities, said the 1997 first quarter figures were surprisingly high.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to predict if we can maintain the momentum. This summer is extremely hot, I hope rains will not be delayed during the wet season (June-November) for rice planting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Farmers depend on rains due to lack of irrigation facilities.</p>
<p>Other analysts, however, said they foresaw that the strong start would continue for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the agriculture sector is out of the intensive care unit,&quot; said Noel Reyes, vice president for research at Anscor Hagedorn Securities.</p>
<p>The agriculture department said the hefty growth was largely due to better crop harvests, including rice and coconuts, which comprised 54.94 percent of total production.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth in crop production accelerated and was highest since 1990,&quot; the department said in a report.</p>
<p>Production of unmilled rice increased 2.14 percent to 2.58 million tonnes in the first quarter due to good weather, bigger harvest area and installation of new irrigation facilities.</p>
<p>Coconut production recovered from the effects of strong typhoons in 1995, with harvests increasing by 8.66 percent to 2.76 millon tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;The momentum in livestock and poultry expansion was sustained while a slight gain in fishery output was recorded,&quot; the report added.</p>
<p>NEDA reported livestock output grew by 6.07 percent in the first quarter as against 4.44 percent in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Poultry output rebounded by 11.15 percent from negative 1.17 while fishery output edged up 0.79 percent against a negative 0.17 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the recent importation of some 650,000 tonnes of rice, the Philippines' staple food, would prevent shortages in July to August.</p>
<p>Philippine rice output is traditionally low in the third quarter.</p>
