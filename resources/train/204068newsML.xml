<p>Thousands of Iraqi Kurds who fled this year to Iran because of inter-Kurdish fighting in the north have returned to Iraq, a U.N. source said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;So far the U.N. has registered 55,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees returning back from Iran since mid October until yesterday (Tuesday),&quot; the U.N. source told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said most of them were returning to the large Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya and nearby villages and towns while the rest were still in border areas.</p>
<p>U.N. humanitarian agencies in northern Iraq were relocating these refugees and giving them assistance, he said. &quot;We are having a problem because we do not have enough food stocks to give these displaced people,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The source said the refugees were not part of the U.N. World Food Programme's winter plan of food distribution from October 1996 to March 1997. It covers a monthly ration of food aid to 493,500 Kurdish beneficiaries in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The number of Iraqi Kurdish refugees sheltering in Iran was estimated at 65,000 in September. There are no updated figures.</p>
<p>The Kurdish fighting erupted in August when Baghdad sent troops to northern Iraq helping one Kurdish faction to fight a rival, prompting Washington to launch two waves of missile strikes in southern Iraq in September.</p>
<p>Fighting between the Baghdad-backed Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) was halted by a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in October. The KDP controls the biggest Kurdish city of Arbil while the PUK rules Sulaimaniya.</p>
<p>Iran is home to two million refugees, 1.4 million from Afghanistan and 600,000 from Iraq, making it the world's most important host country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
