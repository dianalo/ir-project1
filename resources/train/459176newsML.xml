<title>USA: CSCE world sugar ends weaker in rangebound trade.</title>
<headline>CSCE world sugar ends weaker in rangebound trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-21</dateline>

<p>CSCE world sugar futures settled lower as the market consolidated Thursday's gains in an otherwise featureless session, trading sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a typical inside day where players are letting the dust settle after a 31-point range yesterday,&quot; a floor source said.</p>
<p>He noted some light trade buying in the May/July spread, which has remained steady despite recent volatility, and outright buying in May from the low of 10.81 cents.</p>
<p>Market sources said the trade still has some short covering to do, while the speculators have covered a large portion of their short positions this week.</p>
<p>&quot;That may relieve some of the downward pressure and should call for a test at the upper-end of the trading range soon,&quot; a floor source said.</p>
<p>The overhead target for May was seen at 11.05 cents. The contract climbed to a high of 11.01 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Refiner pricing around 10.86 cents capped gains from midday, another trader said.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 7,478 lots compared to Thursday's official 19,999 lots.</p>
<p>May closed 0.07 cent lower at 10.83 cents, having ranged from 10.92 to 10.81 cents.</p>
<p>Open interest in most-active May fell 1,348 lots to 62,253 lots as of Thursday's close.</p>
