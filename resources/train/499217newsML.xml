<title>SOUTH AFRICA: New impetus to South African oil exploration drive.</title>
<headline>New impetus to South African oil exploration drive.</headline>
<dateline>CAPE TOWN 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Efforts by South Africa's state owned oil exploration company Soekor to attract oil companies to its largely unexplored offshore tracts have gained new momentum.</p>
<p>Representatives are currently attending the annual American Association of Petroleum Geologists conference in Dallas to advertise the areas available.</p>
<p>In addition, top staff will travel to Houston next week to meet companies that have expressed interest in sub-leasing five deepwater tracts off South Africa's north coast in a follow-up of the largely unsuccessful 1994 offshore bid round.</p>
<p>Soekor and Oklahoma-based Phillips International Exploration Inc recently announced that they expect to finalise, within two months, a prospecting lease for blocks 17 and 18 in an area stretching from the Mozambican border to just south of Durban.</p>
<p>The Phillips deal is seen as a major breakthrough for Soekor and could entice other oil companies to South Africa's waters.</p>
<p>Soekor petroleum licensing unit manager Jack Holliday said Soekor was promoting exploration and investment opportunities &quot;in exciting frontier tracts offshore South Africa&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;These include deeper water areas off the west and south coasts, which show promise of large oil structures.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, considerable attention is being given to the northern areas of the west coast, which is considered to contain gas structures similar to that of the Kudu gas discovery, just north of South Africa's border,&quot; Holliday said.</p>
<p>Soekor's first-ever licensing round closed in April, 1995.</p>
<p>Soekor has now abandoned competitive bidding in favour of directly sub-leasing tracts to companies.</p>
<p>Holliday said that Soekor had reviewed the complex legal and fiscal system governing oil and gas which many oil companies could not get to grips with.</p>
<p>&quot;The government and Soekor, as a result of the licensing round, have identified restraints and have worked hard at reducing and eliminating these restraints and believe that an investor friendly package is now available to investors.&quot;</p>
<p>Soekor is the exclusive holder of most of South Africa's offshore acreage until 2007.</p>
<p>It is due to start production at its first offshore oilfield near Mossel Bay on the east coast at the end of the month but the International Energy Agency has criticised the fact that it is both a regulator and a player in oil exploration.</p>
<p>As a result, Soekor has formed a separate petroleum licensing unit (PLU) and set up its exploration and production arm as a separate company Soekor E&amp;P, which is being commercialised in preparation for eventual privatisation.</p>
<p>It has recommended that the legal and fiscal complexities be removed and that South Africa follow the example of other countries and put in place an Upstream Petroleum Act to govern the activities of the upstream industry and the PLU.</p>
