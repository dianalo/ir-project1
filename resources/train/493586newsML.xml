<p>Argentina's economic recovery is partly tied to an improvement in its financial system which reflects widespread support for convertibility, analysts say.</p>
<p>Total deposits in the financial system have increased steadily since the end of 1995, favored by an extension of terms.  Total deposits in February 1997 were 56.2 billion pesos, compared with 41 billion in November 1994, before the shock Mexican devaluation which triggered the so-called Tequila crisis throughout Latin America.  </p>
<p>The average term for fixed-term deposits today is 70 days, compared with 36 days in 1994 and 18 days in 1991.</p>
<p>Analysts say the improvement in financial indicators is directly related to the perceived drop in country risk and strength of macroeconomic numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;Without a doubt there is a rise in confidence, although there is a slight drop in the growth rate of deposits,&quot; Jose Luis Espert, director of consultants Econometrica, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The yearly growth rate for deposits is about 20 percent, which isn't negligible,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Since late 1994, when Mexico's devaluation caused bank deposits to drop 20 percent, deposits have risen 35 percent, while deposit terms doubled.</p>
<p>The Tequila effect sent $8.0 billion in deposits fleeing for safer markets and caused a recession throughout 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;From the evolution of interest rates for fixed-term peso and dollar deposits, we see an important drop in the perceived currency risk,&quot; the Fundacion Capital think-tank said in a recent report.  </p>
<p>In February peso deposits continued to rise by 3.2 percent while deposits in foreign currencies rose 0.9 percent, according to the Argentine Banks Association (ADEBA).</p>
<p>Monthly rates for fixed-term peso deposits in December 1995 averaged 0.77 percent and dollar rates averaged 0.62 percent.  Now these rates are 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;The drop in deposit rates is reflected in a dollar-peso spread which is stable at around one percent,&quot; said Fundacion Capital.  </p>
<p>Especially relevant is the growth in fixed-term deposits, especially peso deposits, which have jumped 9.6 percent since last January, ADEBA said.</p>
<p>Argentina's peso has been pegged at par with the dollar since 1991 and every peso in circulation is fully backed by reserves in dollars, gold and bonds.</p>
<p>The convertibility system helped President Carlos Menem's government defeat inflation of 5,000 percent in 1989, when he took office. Annual inflation is now one percent.</p>
<p>Confirming the good financial outlook, Standard &amp; Poor's last week upgraded some leading Argentine banks in line with its upgrade of the country's long-term foreign currency debt.</p>
