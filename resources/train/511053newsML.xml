<title>USA: Sprint sees lower Global One losses.</title>
<headline>Sprint sees lower Global One losses.</headline>

<p>Sprint Corp on Tuesday said it expected to have lower losses in 1997 from Global One than it sustained in 1996, but increased costs for wireless venture Sprint PCS.</p>
<p>&quot;Full year Global One losses are expected to be materially below 1996 levels,&quot; chief financial officer Art Krause said.</p>
<p>Sprint's share of losses at Global One, a European- headquartered venture it owns with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG, were $24 million or $0.04 per share in the first quarter versus $0.03 a year ago.  </p>
<p>In the whole of 1996 Sprint recorded $0.15 per share of Global One losses.</p>
<p>Krause told a conference call that the costs of the wireless expansion would increase during the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Personal Communication Services losses in the first quarter were below expectations but we believe these losses will ramp up over the balance of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sprint spent $544 million in recent Federal auctions to gain extra licenses for its national PCS wireless network.  Of this, $435 million is still due and will be paid at end-April.</p>
<p>The cost of building a network in these license areas over three years is expected to be $1.5 billion, Krause said.</p>
<p>Sprint's first quarter earnings from core operations of $0.88 per share, up from $0.84, were reduced by costs from a number of new operations.</p>
<p>Apart from Global One, Sprint PCS -- a wireless joint venture with several cable TV companies -- cost $0.12 per share against $0.03, while emerging businesses, mostly Internet access, cost $0.05 against nil.</p>
<p>Discontinued operations cost $0.01 per share in charges a year ago. (( Nick Louth, New York Newsroom 212 859 1712))</p>
