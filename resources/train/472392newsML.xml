<headline>INSIGHT- Techs eye key pattern as dlr/mark shrinks.</headline>

<p>A bearish turn in dollar/mark on Thursday had chartists eyeing the neckline of a six-week head-and-shoulders pattern, which was pegged variously between 1.6710 and 1.6725.</p>
<p>After opening above 1.6800, dollar/mark had slid to the top of this range by 1400 EST/1900 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;It's threatening a bear break below a 1.6710/20 neckline of a head-and-shoulders top pattern that started on February 12,&quot; said Scott Siller, senior technical analyst at MCM CurrencyWatch. &quot;If we lose 1.6710/20 it should be good for 1.6500, maybe 1.6300.&quot;  </p>
<p>Technicians said they had expected narrow ranges on Thursday ahead of the long Easter weekend and some were leery about reading too much into dollar/mark's retreat.</p>
<p>Ben Morden, technical analyst at consulting firm I.D.E.A. Inc, said he needed to see more price action to convince him that the topping formation was intact.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been talk that we're developing a head-and-shoulders pattern but I want to stay away from that,&quot; he said. &quot;Today's selloff is coming in thin volume in conjunction with bond and stock weakness.&quot;</p>
