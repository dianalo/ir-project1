<title>USA: Heavy rains, snow hit Midwest.</title>
<headline>Heavy rains, snow hit Midwest.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>A winter storm dumped heavy rain and snow across the central United States on Friday, flooding roads and basements.</p>
<p>Nearly three inches of rain had fallen in Chicago by mid-morning, the most ever recorded in any one day in February, breaking a record set during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Frozen ground caused a rapid runoff that filled underpasses and innundated streets, snarling traffic.</p>
<p>Up to seven inches of snow was reported in parts of Wisconsin on the northern edge of the storm. To the south, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes marched across the lower Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>The Chicago River rose, forcing officials to open locks to discharge water into Lake Michigan. Telephone service was disrupted in parts of the Chicago area and some roads were impassable.</p>
<p>Air traffic was delayed at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports. The Des Plaines River west of Chicago was out of its banks in places.</p>
<p>In Iowa flooding was reported along some streams and flood watches were issued along the Platte River in Nebraska.</p>
<p>Water levels should reach flood levels on sections of the Illinois, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers by this weekend, but the worst flooding may be along tributaries in northern Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, forecasters said.</p>
<p>&quot;We can look for a 10-foot rise in these small tributaries and they are expected to crest six to seven feet above flood stage...,&quot; said Jack Burns, a National Weather Service hydrologist.</p>
<p>Flood warnings were issued Friday in the northern areas of Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.</p>
<p>The Mississippi River at Clarksville, Mo., north of St Louis, rose 3.4 feet in 24 hours and should crest near its flood stage this weekend, Burns said. The Mississippi River widens out at St Louis and was not expected to reach the 30-foot flood level there.</p>
