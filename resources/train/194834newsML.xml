<title>USA: Ex-White House aide denies media reports.</title>

<p>Former White House aide Mark Mark Middleton, at the centre of a controversy over charges of improper fundraising by former Clinton officials and the Democratic Party, issued a statement Friday denying any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported in its Friday editions that the White House was investigating reports that Middleton entertained clients in the White House staff restaurant after he left the government and set up his own consulting company.</p>
<p>Earlier reports quoting Taiwanese business officials alleged that Middleton, who left the White House in February 1995, solicited contributions to the Democratic National Committee on trips over the past two years to Taipei, where he also pursued business deals.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me state unequivocally that I have never represented myself as a White House employee after leaving the White House; I never sought to raise funds for the Clinton-Gore campaign or for the DNC from any prohibited source, and I was not responsible in any way for the contribution made to the DNC by Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata,&quot; Middleton said.</p>
<p>The Indonesia couple, which is linked to a large Indonesian financial conglomerate Lippo Group, contributed $425,000 to the DNC, prompting the Republicans to accuse foreign interests of seeking to influence White House policy.</p>
<p>Middleton also &quot;categorically&quot; denied that he misused access to the White House for personal gain. While he said he visited the White House often after leaving his job, Middleton said &quot;the vast majority&quot; of the visits were personal.</p>
<p>He admitted dining at the White House staff restaurant, probably less than 10 times, after departing, sometimes with friends or business associates.</p>
<p>&quot;I took them there as a courtesy and as an act of friendship. I never discussed business, raising money, or arranged any meetings with any White House official in connection with any of these visits,&quot; Middleton said.</p>
<p>&quot;I never implied in any fashion that I still held a position in the White House or that I had any special influence there; and I do not believe that anyone ever understood my efforts to arrange a lunch or a tour as anything other than the modest gestures that they were,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Middleton defended his integrity and said he would continue to vigorously contest all false allegations.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry Friday said President Clinton did not know DNC fundraiser John Huang went to Taiwan to seek political contributions and could have opposed such activities even though the targets were legally qualified donors, the Washington Post reported in Saturday editions.</p>
<p>The paper said an initial White House review showed that Indonesian business executive James Riady, head of the Lippo Group, saw Clinton six times, while Huang visited the White House about 30 times since July 1, 1995 and met with Clinton about 15 times, each time with others present.</p>
<p>McCurry said Middleton violated White House policy by going to the staff restaurant unescorted, but under a new policy, he would have to be cleared into the White House by the chief of staff for any future visits.</p>
