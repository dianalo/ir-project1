<p>Highlights of European Cup Winners' Cup first round second leg matches on Thursday:</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>The boost of an early goal failed to save Slovak side Chemlon Humenne from an early exit from the competition. They lost 3-1 to AEK Athens on aggregate.</p>
<p>Pavol Dina scored from close range in the first minute to cancel out AEK Athens' lead from the first leg.</p>
<p>The Greek side squandered the chance to equalise when Humenne goalkeeper Juraj Bucek saved Timur Kecbaja's 11th minute penalty. But Humenne's joy was shortlived, Demis Nikolaidis netting the equaliser in the 19th minute.</p>
<p>Daniel Batista Lima scored AEK Athens' winner a minute before halftime.  </p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>PSV Eindhoven gave coach Dick Advocaat an early birthday present when they beat Georgia's Dynamo Batumi 3-0 for a 4-1 aggregate victory.</p>
<p>Advocaat, 49 on Friday, saw Luc Nilis give the Dutch side the lead from the penalty spot in the 15th minute of an undistinguished first half.</p>
<p>PSV sealed a spot in the second round with second half goals by Rene Eykelkamp and Brazilian Marcelo.  </p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>Red Star Belgrade, winners of the European Cup in 1991, scored three times in extra time as they stormed to a 4-0 win over Germany's Kaiserslautern.</p>
<p>The tie went into extra time after Dejan Stankovic had cancelled out Kaiserslautern's lead from the first leg with a goal after 55 minutes.</p>
<p>Stankovic scored again seven minutes into extra time. Red Star's other marksmen were Zoran Njegus and substitute Miodrag Pantelic.  </p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>Liverpool's England centre-back Mark Wright suffered a depressed fracture of the cheekbone in his side's 3-1 victory over MyPa-47 at Anfield.</p>
<p>Wright was forced to go off in the 19th minute after a clash of heads with the Finnish club's English-born striker John Allen.</p>
<p>He faces an operation on Friday and is expected to be sidelined for about six weeks.</p>
<p>Liverpool, 1-0 ahead from the first leg, secured a berth in the second round with goals by Czech international Patrik Berger, his fifth in three games, Stan Collymore and John Barnes.</p>
