<p>Israel re-opened Hebron University in the West Bank on Saturday in an apparent goodwill gesture towards the Palestinians as the two sides appeared on the verge of signing a long-awaited Hebron agreement.</p>
<p>University officials said students resumed studies on Saturday at the site, which Israel closed 10 months ago after a wave of Moslem suicide bombings in Israel killed 59 people.</p>
<p>&quot;Classes have started this morning,&quot; said Nabil Abu Zneid, a university public relations officer. Students walked around the campus chatting happily with one another, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials reiterated on Saturday that they expected Israel and the PLO to sign a Hebron deal by the end of the year.</p>
<p>They said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat planned to visit Cairo on Sunday to brief Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak on the emerging accord that outlines the conditions for Israel's delayed handover of 80 percent of the city to Palestinian rule.</p>
<p>&quot;President Arafat is expected to visit Egypt on Sunday to brief President Mubarak on the latest developments on the Hebron negotiations,&quot; said Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.</p>
<p>He said preparations were underway for a meeting on Tuesday between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to finalise issues that require the approval of both leaders. The two leaders met last week, pushing the Hebron talks forward.</p>
<p>In apparent move to ease tension in the volatile city of Hebron before a signing, the Israeli army said on Friday it would re-open Hebron University.</p>
<p>&quot;The opening of the university was possible after the institute's management committed to keep law and order there,&quot; an army spokesman said.</p>
<p>Witnesses at the university said Israeli soldiers withdrew from the campus on Saturday morning as students entered it.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, elected in May, has delayed implementation of the 1995 Hebron deal signed by his predecessor.</p>
<p>He has demanded increased security arrangements to safeguard 400 Jewish settlers who live in the city among 100,000 Arabs. Palestinians refuse any changes to the deal.</p>
<p>Jibril Rujoub, Palestinian Preventive Security chief for the West Bank, said there were two outstanding security issues that could be overcome in the coming few days. He did not elaborate on the matter.</p>
<p>Rujoub said Arafat would meet Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Sunday evening for additional talks on the Hebron deal ahead of the Arafat-Netanyahu summit.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very close to an agreement and the remaining disputed issues could be resolved in a few days,&quot; Rujoub told Reuters.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Arafat and Netanyahu would set dates for implementing other interim issues including further redeployment from the West Bank, which according to the 1995 interim deal should be concluded in July 1997.</p>
<p>They said the two leaders would also set a date for the resumption of final status talks -- which have yet to resume under Netanyahu who took office in June -- to determine the fate of the West Bank, including Arab East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Hebron talks, stymied since Netanyahu's election, were energised last week by a peace shuttle by U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross. Ross was due to return to the region on Monday.</p>
