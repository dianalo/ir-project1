<title>FRANCE: French Socialists want Europe without austerity.</title>

<p>France's Socialist party, swept to power after a parliamentary election, pledged on Monday to make its views heard on Europe and said all stood to gain if a single currency no longer meant austerity.</p>
<p>Party spokesman Francois Hollande said he believed the left and centre-right agreed on what France was seeking out of Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that President (Jacques Chirac) is committed, like all French people, to have the best possible negotiation for France and for Europe at the time of the switch to the single currency,&quot; he said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We all stand to gain if Italy and Spain are in monetary union, if there is a political government alongside the European Central Bank, if Europe no longer means austerity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Socialist party has said it is committed to monetary union, but with conditions, including a flexible interpretation of the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>Hollande said there was no contradiction between Socialist party campaign pledges -- which include a halt to privatisations, no more tax increases and no more austerity -- and its commitment to monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;You can have the single currency without policies restricting public spending, without privatisations, without raising taxes,&quot; he added..</p>
<p>The Socialists would, however, make budget savings if necessary, after an audit of public finances due to be carried out in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We will make savings everywhere where it is necessary and if we have any effort to make, we will not ask for it from French people with most modest means,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He reiterated that the Socialists were most worried about any overshooting in France's welfare accounts, which are run separately from the central government budget.</p>
<p>The outgoing government, aiming to reduce the total state deficit to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product, had insisted that France was on course to meet its deficit targets this year.</p>
<p>Earlier France's Communists, who hold the balance of power in the new parliament, said they would disclose on Monday a list of demands, including relaxing Maastricht criteria, made to their Socialist allies in order to take part in a government following the left's election victory.</p>
<p>Pierre Zarka, a member of the Communist Party leadership, said the conditions, drawn from a joint pre-election declaration, also included wage rises and cuts in working hours.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made precise questions and we expect answers,&quot; Zarka told France Inter radio.</p>
<p>The Communists wanted &quot;to relax the Maastricht grip so that we no longer suffer external constraints and free ourselves from criteria that are absolutely tragic for the population and the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Lionel Jospin, expected to be named prime minister later on Monday, said during the campaign his party's line on Europe would prevail in any Socialist-led government.</p>
<p>The Communist Party had called for a new referendum on a single currency.</p>
