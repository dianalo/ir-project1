<p>Malaysian rubber prices were steady at midday on technical adjustment and news of SMR20 sales to Germany and China, traders said.</p>
<p>The International Natural Rubber Organisation was, meanwhile, studying the possibility of entering the market to support prices after its five-day indicator price slipped to a level where it could buy rubber from the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's still a bit sluggish but there was some sales reported today,&quot; said a government trade source.  </p>
<p>Some 1,000 tonnes of August SMR20 was reported sold to China at 232 cents a kg while a similar load was reported traded to Germany at 230 cents a kg, said the government source.</p>
<p>At midday, the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board quoted the RSS1 buyer for August at 227 cents a kg and SMR 20 buyer for August at 232 cents. Both grades were unchanged from Thursday's closing prices.</p>
<p>The INRO's five-day indicator was at 182.48 cents a kg on July 10, compared to the 183.56 cents on July 9.</p>
<p>At midday, trading houses quoted the SMR CV at 299 cents, SMR L at 280, SMR5 at 244, SMR10 at 235 and latex at 198 cents.</p>
<p>Malaysia-based shipping brokers quoted freight rates for rubber from Malaysia to Rotterdam at $700 per 20-ft container, and $1,400 per 40-ft container.</p>
