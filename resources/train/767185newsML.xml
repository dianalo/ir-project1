<headline>Methanex says new ships to cut transport costs.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Canadian Methanex Corp said two methanol carriers to be built for it by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd will cut shipment costs from its Chile plant to Rotterdam by 15 percent.</p>
<p>Methanex said in a statement that one of the specialist ships it had selected Mitsui O.S.K. Lines to build and operate will be the world's largest methanol carrier.</p>
<p>Based in Vancouver, Methanex is a major methanol producer. The company operates or has interests in methanol production facilities in British Columbia, Alberta, the United States, Chile and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;By mid 1999, Methanex will have almost three million tonnes of low cost (methanol) production in Chile,&quot; Pierre Choquette, Methanex president and chief executive officer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;With the addition of these two ships, Methanex expects to deliver cost reductions for shipments from Chile to Rotterdam by 15 percent in the year 2000,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Methanex currently operates a fleet of 14 vessels through its wholly-owned Waterfront Shipping Company Ltd subsidiary. All of the vessels are operated on long-term time charters and none are owned.</p>
<p>Mitsui O.S.K. Lines will be responsible for the finance, construction and operation of the two new ships.</p>
<p>The first, at 96,000 dwt, will be double the size of the largest Methanol carrier currently in operation. It will be constructed at Namura Shipbuilding Co Ltd in Osaka.</p>
<p>The second, 45,000 dwt, will be built at Minaminippon Shipbuilding Co Ltd in Usuki City. Both will be delivered in the second half of 1999.</p>
<p>Methanex declined to reveal the terms of either the cost of building the ships or their charter terms.</p>
<p>Wayne Wright, president of Waterfront Shipping, said the new ships would be used to replace older vessels set to come off charter at the end of the decade. He declined to identify which vessels would be involved.</p>
<p>Waterfront currently transports around 6 million tonnes of methanol a year. It has a long-standing relationship with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.</p>
<p>Wright said a &quot;majority&quot; of the vessels it operated were owned by the Japanese line, but declined to be specific.</p>
<p>Waterfront operates four vessels between 15,000 dwt and 20,000 dwt, six of around 30,000 dwt and four of 45,000 dwt.</p>
<p>Methanol carriers are similar to chemical carriers, but have additional nitrogen producing plant to provide an inert atmosphere around the volatile cargo.</p>
<p>Methanex reported a net loss of $7.85 million for 1996 on turnover of $945.7 million, swinging from net income of $200.1 million on revenues of $1.249 billion in 1995.</p>
