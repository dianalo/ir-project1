<title>MALAYSIA: KL short-term rates rise on foreign bank covering.</title>
<headline>KL short-term rates rise on foreign bank covering.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-10-09</dateline>

<p>Short-term interbank rates rose sharply as foreign banks covered their short positions, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said one-week money was up at 7.45/50 percent against 6.90/7.00, two-week was at 7.45/50 against 7.00/10 and one-month at 7.25/30 against 7.20/22.  </p>
<p>However, medium and long-term rates were nearly steady at the previous levels. Three-month money at 7.25/30 percent and six-month at 7.30/35 were both unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign and some big banks are lending longer-term because they view interest rates will be stable around this level,&quot; said a dealer with a local bank.</p>
<p>He said the market was short on funds up to one-month money though overall liquidity was adequate.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the rate rise was also in reaction to the overnight rate remaining above 8.0 percent in the last two days. It ended at 8.30 percent on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Everybody who has funds is lending long-term. This has also pushed up swaps on the short-end,&quot; said a dealer with a foreign bank.</p>
<p>She said it was also possible that large banks had overlent to the central bank at its intervention on Friday.</p>
<p>Bank Negara regularly intervenes in the domestic money market to keep liquidity under check and set interest rates.</p>
<p>Another money market dealer said banks were probably also locking up their funds in long-term deposits before interbank rates dropped after an 800-million ringgit maturity of Government bonds on October 15.</p>
