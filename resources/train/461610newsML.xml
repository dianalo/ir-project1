<title>BURMA: Burma says neo-colonialists behind religious strife.</title>
<headline>Burma says neo-colonialists behind religious strife.</headline>
<dateline>RANGOON 1997-03-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A senior Burmese military official on Saturday accused traitors at home and &quot;neo-colonialists&quot; abroad of orchestrating recent racial and religious clashes.</p>
<p>&quot;Above ground internal traitors, contracting with the neo-colonialists, are instigating and inciting to cause racial and religious conflicts and mar already-restored community peace and tranquility,&quot; official media quoted Lieutenant General Tin Oo as saying at a ceremony opening a dam.</p>
<p>He added that racial and religious conflicts could lead to disintegration of the country.</p>
<p>Analysts in Rangoon said he was referring to the recent unrest in the city of Mandalay, where Buddhist monks demonstrated and ransacked several Moslem mosques after an incident last weekend in which a Buddhist girl was raped by a Moslem man.</p>
<p>The city remains under an 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew, residents and official sources said.</p>
<p>The general's comments marked the first veiled reference by a leader of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to the trouble in Burma's second city.</p>
<p>Conflicting reports have emerged on the unrest in Mandalay, with some diplomats saying they heard one young monk had died after troops shot over the heads of monks to stop them from protesting on Monday.</p>
<p>Monks associated with exiled student groups based on the Burma-Thailand border said 15 monks had been arrested and jailed after the unrest.</p>
<p>Besides the curfew, authorities have also imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which bars gatherings of more than five people, in some townships in Mandalay.</p>
<p>A government spokesman said the unrest was confined to a few townships in Mandalay and had not spread to other areas.</p>
