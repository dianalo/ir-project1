<p>Foreign oil companies operating in Colombia are worried about proposed reforms that could cut their profit margins and give more power to the state oil company Ecopetrol, an industry spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're worried about changes in the rules of the game,&quot; Alejandro Martinez, president of the Colombian Petroleum Association, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of proposed legislative changes that work agains the oil industry,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>The Petroluem Association represents all of the multinational oil companies operating in Colombia. It has long complained about the low margin of profitability in the country because of the strict terms of existing government contracts and concession terms.</p>
<p>Government officials could not be reached for immediate comment. But according to Martinez, changes proposed to the current session of Congress threaten to turn foreign oil giants operating in Colombia into little more than contractors for Ecopetrol.</p>
<p>The state oil company would become a virtual monopoly, he said, adding that it would have operational control over all fields and the power to set all prices and production levels.</p>
<p>The reforms, proposed by a group of congressmen who Martinez did not identify, include a provision calling for a member of the country's powerful oil workers union to sit on the board of directors of Ecopetrol.</p>
<p>The union, known by its acronym USO, has long been known for its fiercely nationalistic stance and calls for U.S. oil companies, in particular, to leave Colombia.</p>
