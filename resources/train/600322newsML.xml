<p>The silken voice, buttoned-up suits and effete imperfect subjunctive verbs of Edouard Balladur are back in France's political limelight.</p>
<p>The campaign for a May 25-June 1 parliamentary election has propelled the silver-haired patrician who was prime minister from 1993 to 1995 back to centre stage, two years after fellow Gaullist Jacques Chirac beat him for the presidency.</p>
<p>After a reconciliation handshake with Chirac on the steps of the Elysee palace on April 23, Balladur was assigned a key role in mobilising conservative voters by advocating more austere, free-market policies.</p>
<p>&quot;France must make a clearer shift in a liberal direction in its economic and social policies,&quot; he said in one interview.</p>
<p>&quot;This means less spending, smaller deficits, lower taxes, more contracts, more dialogue, more freedom, more flexibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Opinion polls show many centre-right voters, especially among employers and the upper-middle classes, are keen to see Balladur back as premier in place of Alain Juppe if the ruling coalition wins the May 25-June 1 election.</p>
<p>Unlike the presidential race, when he tried uncomfortably to act the man of the people by climbing on tables and eating with his fingers at a barbecue, Balladur has stuck to his own style as a slightly old-fashioned gentleman in this campaign.</p>
<p>Many insiders expect Chirac to reappoint Juppe, despite his unpopularity, if there is a big centre-right majority. But if the margin is narrow, he may have to turn to someone else.</p>
<p>Economists say financial markets would welcome a comeback for Balladur, whereas anti-Maastricht Gaullist Philippe Seguin, the most popular candidate for premier with voters, would give markets the jitters.</p>
<p>&quot;The market would be encouraged to see someone more liberal such as Balladur coming in,&quot; said Joanne Perez, a Paris-based economist with U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch. &quot;He would be seen as a unifying force within the right.&quot;</p>
<p>Balladur has consistently supported the drive for a single European currency, in contrast to the more Eurosceptical Seguin.</p>
<p>But how far Chirac is prepared to go in rehabilitating the former protege who ran against him in 1995 remains to be seen.</p>
<p>To some Chirac aides, appointing Balladur would amount to a virtual abdication, and is thus unthinkable. To others, the most Chirac might offer Balladur would be a super-ministry of finance and privatisation.</p>
<p>The ex-premier has staked out a position to the right of Juppe but he has been scrupulously loyal to Chirac and avoided criticising the prime minister.</p>
<p>When Juppe called for a reduction of 5,000 civil servants a year, Balladur said the aim should be at least 10,000.</p>
<p>When Juppe said the rise in public spending should be kept below the rate of inflation, Balladur said state expenditure should be reduced by some 10 billion francs a year.</p>
<p>He advocates cutting the French tax burden from more than 45 percent of gross domestic product at present to the European average of 42.5 percent and cutting the public deficit by 20 billion francs a year.</p>
<p>Critics say his tough fiscal stance contrasts with the more expansionary policy he pursued between 1993 and 1995 to pull the French economy out of its first postwar recession.</p>
<p>Balladur, a former chief aide to president Georges Pompidou in 1969-73, launched France's first wave of privatisations as finance minister in 1986-88 and is widely regarded as the father of &quot;capitalisme a la francaise&quot;.</p>
<p>The state sold stakes in privatised firms to a &quot;stable core&quot; of French institutions, thus retaining some influence in the companies' management through cross shareholdings.</p>
<p>The system was designed to protect privatised firms from hostile takeovers or foreign control. Critics said it was an obstacle to accountability and maximising shareholder value.</p>
<p>Balladur applied the same principle in a second wave of sell-offs in 1993, designating 20 state-owned companies for privatisation within five years. Several remain to be sold.</p>
