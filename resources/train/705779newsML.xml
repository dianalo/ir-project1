<p>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said on Thursday that his first budget had done what was necessary to bring fiscal and monetary policy back into balance but added that no-one could be happy with sterling's sharp rise.</p>
<p>Brown told a news conference that his budget had tightened policy by nearly 6.0 billion stg and said :&quot;If you look at that you will see I have done what is necessary to bring fiscal and monetary policy back into balance.&quot;  </p>
<p>Britain's new chancellor said he wanted to help exporters who have been squeezed by the pound's relentless rise and said the re-balancing of policy would do so.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I want a stable and competitive pound,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to mitigate the pressures on exporters. Nobody can be happy about an 18 percent rise in the pound in current circumstances,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>His budget had raised taxes on the consumer by far more than the one billion stg suggested by the British media, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you'll find it is far more significant that that,&quot; he said, alluding to the impact of the cut in mortgage tax relief, higher stamp duty and rises in excise duties, petrol and cigarettes.</p>
<p>&quot;It is wrong to say we haven't taken the necessary decisions and it is also wrong to say all the burden is falling on business,&quot; he told reporters at a post budget news conference.</p>
