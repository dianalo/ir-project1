<p>Egyptian share prices on Sunday continued their slow climb out of the doldrums, with Medinet Nasr Housing and Development generating most of the day's trade.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index gained 0.28 points to end at 335.46 but volume was a below-average 37.73 ($11 million).</p>
<p>The market on Tuesday hit its lowest level since mid-January but a rise on Thursday's bourse reversed the downtrend.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a turnaround in many stocks on today's market. Most quality stocks rose due to the fact that people realise the prices are low these days and are taking advantage of this,&quot; said Mohammed Abdullah, managing director of Intercapital Brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend has been towards slipping. The market might not climb a lot over the next few weeks but I think it has hit the bottom and will slowly rise,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Medinet Nasr Housing and Development was the day's most active share, closing 11.25 pounds higher at 237 after trading in 11.40 million pounds.</p>
<p>Abdullah said interest in the company was generated by market expectations that the housing firm would soon issue global depository receipts.</p>
<p>Helwan Portland Cement climbed 2.6 pounds to close at 69.1 after shares worth 2.85 million pounds changed hands, while Egyptian Tora Portland Cement ended trade 1.49 pounds higher at 86.5.</p>
<p>Several stocks made healthy price gains, including General Silos and Storage which rose 3.93 pounds to 82.68 and East Delta Flour Mills which closed 2.9 pounds higher at 60.9.</p>
<p>Of the 88 shares traded, 39 rose, 28 ended lower and 28 remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The index for openly traded firms fell to 447.47 points from 450.58 points on Thursday and that for the rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 251.32 points from 250.18.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.395 pounds</p>
