<p>Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development Co has set the price for a three-for-10 rights issue for all shareholders at 5.50 yuan per share, a company statement said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The issue was approved by a shareholders' meeting on August 8 and will allow the firm to issue 60 million new foreign currency B shares and 159.9 million new domestic A shares.</p>
<p>The statement said the issue would raise approximately 1.177 billion yuan for the company, with the proceeds to be used for construction, real estate development and relocation in three areas of the Pudong New District.</p>
<p>Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities has been appointed lead underwriter for the issue and Nomura International (Hong Kong) Limited international coordinator, the statement said.  </p>
<p>Ex-rights date for both A shares and B shares is November 8, the statement said.</p>
<p>After the rights issue, B shares will account for 260 million shares or 27.3 percent of the company's total of 952.9 million shares and publicly traded A shares 8.6 percent.</p>
<p>State-owned A shares account for 60 percent and shares held by the company's founders for 4.1 percent, the statement said. Neither of these shares are tradeable.</p>
<p>Trading in Lujiazui's shares was suspended this morning on the announcement. At the close on Tuesday, its A share closed at 46.86 yuan and its B share at $0.92.</p>
