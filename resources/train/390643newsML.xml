<title>COTE D'IVOIRE: Zaire envoy denies South Africa talks.</title>
<headline>Zaire envoy denies South Africa talks.</headline>
<dateline>ABIDJAN 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A senior Zairean politician in Cape Town denied on Thursday that he would hold talks with Zairean rebels despite South African indications that a peace initiative was on track.</p>
<p>&quot;There has never been any question of meeting any member of the (Zairean) rebellion in South Africa,&quot; Ngbanda Nzambo Ko Ayumba, the nephew and chief security adviser of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko told Radio France Internationale (RFI) in a telephone interview from Cape Town.</p>
<p>&quot;I simply note that this morning a South African government statement specified that there was no plan for a meeting between a member of the government of Zaire and the rebels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>South African President Nelson Mandela said on Wednesday his country would try to bring the two sides together in Cape Town on Thursday. A spokesman for Mandela said the peace initiative was on track but South Africa put a lid on all news.</p>
<p>&quot;For us there are conditions, we want first of all the real people behind this aggression to show their goodwill and respect the decisions of the Security Council,&quot; Ngbanda said, referring to a U.N. call for all foreign forces to withdraw.</p>
<p>&quot;We are being attacked by three neighbouring countries and we demand that the three neighbouring countries pull out their soldiers and let Zaireans find a solution to their internal problems,&quot; he added.</p>
