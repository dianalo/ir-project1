<title>SOUTH KOREA: S.Korean Red Cross plans corn shipment to North.</title>
<headline>S.Korean Red Cross plans corn shipment to North.</headline>

<p>The South Korean Red Cross plans to begin shipping 15,000 tonnes of corn to North Korea next week to help stave off famine, the secretary general of the organisation said on Monday.</p>
<p>Lee Byung-woong said his organisation also planned to give its North Korean counterpart an estimate of how much other food aid was planned.</p>
<p>That issue had created a deadlock in inter-Korean Red Cross talks in Beijing aimed at speeding up aid shipments. The talks, held earlier this month, were the first contact between the two Korean organisations in nearly five years.</p>
<p>The North demanded to know the exact amount of aid before it would discuss how the grain would be delivered.</p>
<p>The corn to be shipped next week was donated by dozens of local religious and civic groups who have set a target of raising enough funds to buy another 95,000 tonnes of corn in the next two months.</p>
<p>Lee on Monday met representatives from those groups and others to ask them how much more they could contribute.</p>
<p>He said the South Korean Red Cross, the only window for private-sector aid to the communist North, would compile the answers and pass the information on to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to compile all commitments in a week to 10 days and inform the North,&quot; Lee told Reuters. &quot;I would like to see the resumption of South-North Red Cross talks within this month.&quot;</p>
<p>Lee, the chief South Korean delegate in the Beijing talks, said he expected civic groups to commit well over $10 million.</p>
<p>He said his organisation wanted to speed up delivery of relief supplies by setting up channels for directly handing over aid rather than using the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as a go-between as in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;As direct delivery is not possible now, we plan to start sending next week 15,000 tonnes of corn via the IFRC,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>International aid groups have said North Korea, hit by devastating floods in 1995 and 1996, is sliding into famine.</p>
<p>Officials report children dying from malnutrition and farmers eating sawdust.</p>
<p>&quot;The months of May, June, July and August will probably be the most difficult months for North Koreans,&quot; Lee said, adding that the harvest would begin in September.</p>
