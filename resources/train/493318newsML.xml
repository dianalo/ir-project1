<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S. African refineries to see some margin recovery.</title>
<headline>S. African refineries to see some margin recovery.</headline>

<p>The surge in world refinery margins is expected to boost South African refineries' margins as well -- but not immediately and then not for long, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They were commenting on reports that refineries elsewhere in the world were cranking up production to take advantage of soaring profit margins and to prepare for the Northern Hemisphere peak driving summer season.</p>
<p>In the complex regulations covering the South African oil industry, refinery margins are linked to those in Singapore, which are the highest in the world.</p>
<p>Last week one refinery in Singapore saw margins move as high as $6.35 a barrel before slipping back to $6.17, or $3 more than in the Mediterranean, the world's next most profitable region.</p>
<p>Analysts said that because of the leads and lags involved in buying oil abroad and shipping it to South Africa, the gains from the lower crude prices would take &quot;a few weeks&quot; to filter through to local refineries.</p>
<p>Profit taking would only last as long as it took market forces to change the Singapore postings that determined South African prices and margins, and that would be fairly soon. Profit margins would then fall off again.</p>
<p>They did not expect the sharply lower prices of  last week to continue for much longer and saw the oil price settling at between $18 and $19 a barrel. Last week the oil price slumped $1.70 and by Monday had only recovered 29 cents to $17.97.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a bit of a bonanza opportunity but I do not know that that is going to affect the South African situation that much,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the refineries are running at capacity and the bulk of the product that they are producing is going to bed in the country. We also do not have a summer peak season coming up,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;What this will do is provide a short-term windfall, profit opportunity for local refineries but it will be something that washes through the system. It will in a sense balance the squeeze that occurred as prices rose last year.&quot;</p>
<p>South Africa has three coastal and one inland crude oil refineries with a combined capacity of 455,000 barrels a day. It also has two synthetic fuel refineries with a combined capacity of 195,000 barrels a day.</p>
