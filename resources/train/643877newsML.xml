<headline>NWE gas oil firms on futures, market moribund.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gas oil was slightly stronger on Friday as benchmark IPE futures recovered some of Thursday's losses but physical trade remained subdued, traders said.</p>
<p>June IPE was trading $1 higher at $166.75 a tonne at 1125 GMT, while the July contract was 75 cents up at $168.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>The heating oil barge market was deserted with premiums for first half delivery assessed at June IPE +50 cents/+$1.0 fob ARA.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel barges were also fragile. Fob Antwerp or Flushing barges were heard offered at June IPE +$8.25, while fob Rotterdam material was on offer at June IPE +$8.50 and +$9.0.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very quiet. It looks like people have given up for the week,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The cargo market was in a similarly moribund state.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cargoes were assessed at July IPE +$6.0/+$8.0 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Russian cargoes remained plentiful with diffs quoted at around June IPE +50 cents/+$1.50 a tonne.</p>
