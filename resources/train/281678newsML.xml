<headline>US Midwest power rises for post-holiday deliveries.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spot bulk electricity prices in the midwestern U.S. were mostly higher Tuesday, lifted by expectations for higher industrial loads following the holiday.</p>
<p>Temperatures throughout the Midwest are forecast to remain well above-normal through this weekend, with the warmest temperatures as high as 25 degrees above-normal expected late this week.</p>
<p>In the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), peak, non-firm power prices for Thursday delivery were discussed in the $16.00-$17.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) area, up about $1 from Monday.</p>
<p>Off-peak non-firm MAPP power for Thursday was pegged at $10.00-$10.50.</p>
<p>In the Mid-American Interpool Network (MAIN), peak, non-firm power prices for Thursday were still in the $16.00-17.00 range.</p>
<p>MAIN off peak power for Thursday was assessed at $11.50-12.00, but no deals were confirmed done.</p>
<p>Peak, non-firm electricity prices in the East Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement (ECAR) for Thursday were in the $14.00-15.25 range, up from Monday's range of $13.00-14.00.</p>
<p>For next week delivery, peak, non-firm prices in ECAR were talked in the $18.50-19.50 area.</p>
<p>ECAR electricity prices for off-peak, non-firm delivery were quoted at $10.00-$12.00.</p>
<p>January ECAR prices were in the $21.50-22.00 range, traders said. The February market was pegged at $23.00-23.25.</p>
<p>In the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), where temperatures are expected to climb to as much as 25 degrees above-normal this week, peak, non-firm power prices for Thursday delivery were up about $3-$4 to the $14.00-$15.50 range.</p>
<p>Sources said the return of industrial loads following the holiday boosted prices.</p>
<p>Off-peak prices throughout SPP for Thursday delivery were assessed at $11.00-12.00.</p>
<p>January peak prices in SPP were in the $20.00 area, while the February market was talked in the $23.75-24.50.</p>
<p>Separately, Commonwealth Edison said its 794 megawatt (MW) Dresden 2 nuclear power unit would likely resume full power Wednesday, ramping up from about 40 percent power. Dresden 3 is still scheduled to restart January 13, and 1,040 MW Zion 2 nuclear unit is expected to resume full power later this week.</p>
