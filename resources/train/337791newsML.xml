<headline>CFTC files complaint against New York Forex firm.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged New York Forex Ex-Center Corp with seven counts of violating the Commodity Exchange Act, including illegally offering and selling off-exchange futures contracts.</p>
<p>In an administrative complaint filed Tuesday, the CFTC also charged New York Forex and its president, Peter Lai, with fraudulently soliciting customers, embezzling customer funds and &quot;bucketing&quot; their orders from June 1993 to May 1995.</p>
<p>In addition, the complaint said the firm was not registered as a futures commission merchant, a designation that would allow it to hold customers' money. The firm was registered as a commodity trading adviser from May 20, 1994 to August 2, 1995.</p>
<p>The National Futures Association terminated New York Forex's registration in August 1995, because Lai, the sole principal, had been missing since May 16, 1995.</p>
<p>One month later, New York Forex filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York, according to the CFTC's complaint. The complaint also said Lai's last known address was in San Jose, California.  </p>
<p>Andrew Scudiero, who was also named in the CFTC's seven-count complaint, was never registered as a salesperson but began soliciting customers for New York Forex in the spring of 1995, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The CFTC said Scudiero &quot;appears to be unfit&quot; for registration due to past securities fraud violations and a 1986 narcotics conviction.</p>
<p>CFTC officials could not immediately be reached for comment. ((Derivatives desk 312-408-8750;E-mail derivatives@reuters.com))</p>
