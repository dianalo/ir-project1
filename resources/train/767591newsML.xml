<p>Three people were injured by machinegun fire, cars were set ablaze and a bomb was thrown during a night of violence in Portuguese-ruled Macau linked to triad gang wars over casino rackets, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nobody was killed in the incidents, the latest in a spate of violent clashes between Chinese triad gangsters over proceeds from illegal protection and loansharking rackets feeding off the enclave's legal casino business, Macau's biggest industry.</p>
<p>But at least 16 people have been killed so far this year in the turf wars over casino-related rackets.</p>
<p>Three security guards were injured when sprayed with machinegun fire in the early hours outside the 600-room New Century Hotel in the Taipa district, where a new casino is set to open next weekend.</p>
<p>The guards were installing a television camera security system near the hotel's lobby when a gunman opened fire from a car, wounding them in their legs.</p>
<p>Police later seized the gunman's car, but there were no arrests reported.</p>
<p>Police removed and detonated a bomb planted under a tourist bus outside the same hotel three weeks ago, and the building suffered another bomb scare two weeks ago.</p>
<p>In a separate overnight incident, three cars were gutted by fire outside the Macau Jockey Club on Taipa Island. One of the cars was said to be owned by a government official.</p>
<p>Also, a homemade bomb was hurled into a garden next to the Government Palace on Avenida da Praia Grande, but the explosion was minor and did no damage, police said.</p>
<p>The government last week pushed through a tough new anti-triad law modelled on Italy's anti-Mafia laws, providing for lengthy prison terms for members of triad groups in a bid to crack down on the wave of violence.</p>
<p>Triads are secret criminal societies which operate in Hong Kong, Macau and southern China. They are often well organised and linked to wide range of illegal activities ranging from drug trafficking, smuggling and prostitution to protection rackets.</p>
<p>The two main triad groups are the 14K and the Soi Fong. The gunman at the New Century Hotel fired 14 shots, which one police source said indicated the handiwork of the 14K triad.</p>
<p>The enclave has been under Portuguese rule for four and a half centuries, but Lisbon has recognised China's sovereignty there and China is set to take back the small territory of 455,000 people in 1999.</p>
<p>Tourism and gaming produced 43 percent of Macau's gross domestic product in 1996, and more than three quarters of the enclave's 8.1 million visitors came primarily for gambling, most of them from nearby Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Taxes on gambling are estimated to provide more than half of the Macau government's current income.</p>
<p>Tourist arrivals have fallen off considerably since May, when the violence was generating news headlines.</p>
