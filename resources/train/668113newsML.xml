<p>The Australian government will keep up pressure to ensure that interest rates are as low as possible, Treasurer Peter Costello told a meeting of government members on Tuesday, according to a party spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;We will keep pressure on trying to keep interest rates as low as possible,&quot; spokesman Kevin Andrews quoted Costello as saying.  </p>
<p>Andrews said Prime Minister John Howard told government members that recent interest rate cuts would flow through to the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;He said that interest rates would flow through. He said there's a lag of 12 to 18 months between interest rate adjustments and consequences,&quot; Andrews told reporters.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has eased monetary policy four times in less than a year, reducing rates by 0.5 percentage points each time. Official cash rates are now at 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>The most recent cut was on May 23, while the first was in July last year. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730</p>
