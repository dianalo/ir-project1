<p>Oil prices are on the slide but the global economy is not reaping the full benefit of the anti-inflationary impact.</p>
<p>A rise in crude oil prices at the end of last year rang alarm bells for global inflation. While their subsequent fall cools the risk of a resurgence in price pressures, it will stop short of leading to lower prices to consumers, analysts say.</p>
<p>For one thing, companies tend to take advantage of such price falls to boost margins. There is also a cause-and-effect lag on a macroeconomic level. And some economists even question whether oil can have more than a neglible effect in any case.</p>
<p>&quot;If crude oil had stayed in the $25 a barrel range for a year or so, there would have been a significant risk of some inflation embedding itself in industrialised economies,&quot; said Stephen Lewis, director of research at London Bond Broking.</p>
<p>&quot;The subsequent decline has reduced this risk.&quot;</p>
<p>World benchmark Brent crude futures have slumped this year from just below $25 in early January to $17.54 on April 10, the lowest in nearly 10 months. The May Brent future has since range traded around the $18 level.</p>
<p>The decline resulted from a combination of renewed Iraqi exports, quota-busting among the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members, robust non-OPEC supply growth, and lacklustre winter demand for heating fuel.</p>
<p>Leslie Nicholas, energy analyst at GNI in London, agreed oil prices were unlikely to contribute to global inflation in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;For the year as a whole the fundamentals point to oil not being the inflationary contribution it was last year, simply because of the supply excess in the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he said oil prices would need to hold around levels at least a couple of dollars lower for there to be a significant effect on the world economy and cause deflation.</p>
<p>One important route that oil price changes impact on the real economy is through the transport sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The dangerous part of the process is the general increase in transport costs (from an oil price rise),&quot; said Lewis. &quot;If that is passed on to the consumers of the goods transported, it is very difficult to roll back that kind of inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>But Lewis said the lag between an oil price rise and that rise being passed on to consumers meant last year's rise in prices was yet to trickle down to the consumer level.</p>
<p>&quot;So I doubt (prices will fall) because I doubt whether the increase in oil prices had actually become embedded in transported goods at the consumer level,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Typically, companies are more reluctant to pass on the benefits of lower prices to consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;That tends to be a slower process,&quot; said Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;Over time the competition between producers is likely to lead to a benifical impact on prices to consumers. But typically that takes longer to work because there's not the same pressure on producers of those goods to pass on price falls.&quot;</p>
<p>Ros Lifton, senior international economist at HSBC Markets in London, questioned the amount of influence events in the oil market have on the real economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Oil prices really haven't had a huge impact since the mid-1980s,&quot; she said. &quot;It may play a role in some countries, but you're talking about an effect of around 0.1 percent on inflation rates...maybe 0.2 percent for countries more dependent on oil.&quot;</p>
<p>Within the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, Japan, Italy and Germany tend to be the ones with a high propensity to consume oil, since their economies have a relatively large manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil price fall will remove an inflation risk from those economies,&quot; said London Bond Broking's Lewis.</p>
<p>Lifton said the present low inflation enjoyed by continental Europe was largely thanks to the wage cycle, not oil prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact oil prices have fallen consistently in the latter 1980s has been a cap on inflation. But the reason inflation is so low in continental Europe is largely down to the wage cycle or the influence of commodity prices generally,&quot; she said.</p>
