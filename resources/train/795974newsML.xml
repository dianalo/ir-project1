<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - UK's FTSE 100 sustained its biggest one-day point loss in almost five months as a sharp reversal on Wall Street, lingering worries about rising interest rates and weak bond markets spooked investors, dealers and strategists said. The FTSE 100 closed at 5003.6, down 72.2 points, or 1.42 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares dropped sharply, unsettled by losses on Wall Street and disconcerted by the approaching possibility of a German interest rate rise. The DAX-30 index closed at 4278.48, down 84.61 points, or 1.94 percent. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4237.06, down 140.45 points, or 3.21 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares fell 2.5 percent as investors were rattled by a second day of heavy selling on Wall Street and a slew of mixed signals. The CAC-40 index closed at 2924.04, down 74.53 points, or 2.49 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended near session lows, losing more than two percent in broad declines tied to selling in index futures, traders said. The Swiss market index closed at 5682.1, down 126.3 points, or 2.17 percent.</p>
<p>MILAN - Italian shares slipped back and ended lower after a short-lived rally on the back of better than expected U.S. economic data faltered and Wall Street started on a lower note this afternoon, dealers said. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 14398, down 202 points, or 1.38 percent.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Dutch shares closed with one of their biggest ever one day losses, as an edgy market wilted under a slew of volatile international influences, dealers said. The AEX index closed at 935.76, down 42.64 points, or 4.36 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed slightly weaker, as a late sudden rally in shares in the debt-ridden construction sector helped to recoup most of the benchmark index's losses, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 19008.60, down 90.51 points, or 0.47 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks staged a rebound, erasing morning losses to end the session firm as selling dried up in the property sector and bargain hunters pushed prices higher. The Hang Seng index closed at 16482.93, up 99.52 points, or 0.61 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian share market was hit by a tumble on Wall Street, but regained ground in afternoon trade to end off its lows. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2623.6, down 26.9 points, or 1.01 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares got a late boost from U.S. data that appeared to ease inflation fears across the Atlantic, but stocks still ended down as diamond giant De Beers took a hammering on reaction to its half-year results. The All-share index closed at 7538.0, down 41.9 points, or 0.55 percent. The All Gold index closed at 1026.1, up 9.1 points, or 0.89 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 9243.1, down 24.6 points, or 0.27 percent.</p>
