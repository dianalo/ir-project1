<headline>Alpha 1 seeks financing to continue opers.</headline>

<p>Alpha 1 Biomedicals Inc said Thursday it continues to seek additional financing to fund operations beyond the second quarter of 1997.  </p>
<p>Alpha 1 said in a release that based on existing resources, it will have sufficient cash to sustain operations to the middle of the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>However, the company said that, if additional financing cannot be obtained prior to that time, it will likely be forced to discontinue operations.</p>
<p>The company reported revenues for the first quarter of $9,229 and a net loss of $210,844, or $0.02 per share. The results for the same quarter of the preceding year were revenues of $8,288 and a loss of $1,069,763, or $0.12 per share.  </p>
<p>Alpha 1 said that research and development expenses during the current period were $39,336, a decrease of $748,192 from the prior period.</p>
<p>It said the current period decrease reflects the effect of a cost reduction program implemented during early 1996.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses during the current period were $145,925, the company said, a decrease of $84,994 from the comparable period a year earlier.  It added that the decrease primarily reflects the effect of the cost reduction program and the effect of proprietary rights becoming fully amortized during the prior period.</p>
<p>Alpha 1 said that during 1996, it suspended its development program for Thymosin beta 4, the company's proprietary product, primarily due to a lack of funding.</p>
<p>During March 1997, the company  said it concluded a $200,000 private placement of equity securities, the proceeds of which will be used for general and administrative expenses, in addition to conducting preclinical animal studies using Thymosin beta 4.</p>
<p>Subsequent to March 31, 1997, Alpha 1 said it received an additional $50,000 from the private placement, but that it continues to seek additional financing to fund operations.</p>
