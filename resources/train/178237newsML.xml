<p>Manager Bobby Gould said on Saturday Welsh soccer had hit rock bottom but insisted he would not resign despite a 7-1 thrashing by the Netherlands -- the worst World Cup defeat ever suffered by Wales.</p>
<p>Asked if he was thinking of stepping down, he snapped back a defiant &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>Gould said there had been harsh words for the players inside the dressing room after the game but refused to publicly condemn them.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all in this together,&quot; said Gould. &quot;We've hit rock bottom. The players have all said they are at the lowest ebb of their careers and so am I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a great team give a wonderful performance tonight. They were better than us in every position -- except perhaps the goalkeeper.&quot; said Gould, acknowledging a debt to Neville Southall, without whose heroics the score could have been in double figures,</p>
