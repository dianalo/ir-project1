<p>Parliament in Belarus on Tuesday wrote into law sweeping powers won by President Alexander Lukashenko in a controversial referendum last year, extending his term and his control over the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>&quot;We have consolidated the decisions taken by a majority of Belarussian citizens last autumn,&quot; said Vladimir Karavai, head of parliament's legislation and state-building committee.</p>
<p>The upper house amended a law on the presidency of Belarus by 43 votes -- the number required for a quorum in the 60-seat chamber -- to nil.</p>
<p>Lukashenko rewrote the constitution in November last year after a landslide win in a referendum which critics said was illegitimate and ignored the old constitution.</p>
<p>The changes extended his term by more than two years to 2002 and tightened his grip on institutions including parliament.</p>
<p>Lukashenko has since signed a charter union joining his country of 10 million people to Russia. But it has been watered down by liberals in Moscow who feared it would give him too much power in both countries.</p>
<p>Following the November referendum, Lukashenko re-formed both houses of parliament, which now give him overwhelming support.</p>
<p>Lukashenko's parliamentary opponents, who tried to block the referendum, have since set up an alternative chamber which has only recently starting holding talks with his administration.</p>
<p>The referendum allowed Lukashenko to re-start the clock on his five-year term and appoint the head and half the judges of the constitutional court and the leaders of the high economic court, the central bank and deputy prime ministers.</p>
<p>Lukashenko can also dissolve both houses of parliament if they reject his choice of prime minister twice or refuse to pass the government's programme for the year.</p>
