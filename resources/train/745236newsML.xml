<p>Senior Irish republican official Martin McGuinness said on Tuesday that his pro-British foes would probably join September peace talks on Northern Ireland despite their reservations.</p>
<p>The Democratic Unionist Party led by Ian Paisley became the latest of the Protestant parties to announce it was quitting the peace talks in response to terms of a weekend ceasefire by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that within both communities in the North of Ireland, there is a very strong desire that we (must) have a negotiated settlement,&quot; declared McGuinness, a senior official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm.</p>
<p>He was speaking after he and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams had talks in west Belfast, an Irish nationalist stronghold, with a group of senior Irish-Americans who have played a prominent role in recent years in brokering peace in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Delegation member William Flynn, chairman of the Mutual of America insurance company, said he believed that Adams might soon be invited again to the White House in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not be surprised, but I don't speak for the president,&quot; said Flynn. &quot; I think it will come sooner than you might think.&quot;</p>
<p>Adams said that he was planning a trip to the United States but it had not been finalised. &quot;Obviously we are very preoccupied with the developing situation here in Ireland, but I do intend to go to the States,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>McGuinness urged Unionists to set aside doubts about the three-day-old truce called by the IRA in its 28-year campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and agree to sit down with Sinn Fein at talks on the future of the province.</p>
<p>Earlier, two Protestant parties -- the Democratic Unionists and Robert McCartney's United Kingdom Unionists -- said they would boycott talks, accusing Britain of IRA appeasement.</p>
<p>The Ulster Unionist Party, led by David Trimble, has pledged not to walk out but has threatened to deal current multi-party talks a sharp blow by opposing key Anglo-Irish measures on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Unionist politicians represent the majority Protestant population who want Northern Ireland to stay British and reject the republicans' aim of merging into an all-Ireland state.</p>
<p>Unionists argue that the IRA truce is not meant to last and blame London for softening a demand for a handover of guerrilla guns to ease Sinn Fein into talks.</p>
<p>Their doubts are casting shadows over an Anglo-Irish attempt to end the province's protracted instability, which was boosted by the IRA announcement of a &quot;complete cessation&quot; of hostilities.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that most people have long since come to the conclusion that this can only be resolved at the negotiating table,&quot; McGuinness said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore I am very hopeful, and very optimistic that come September 15 the Ulster Unionists at least, but I also think Mr Paisley and Mr McCartney will come to the negotiating table...&quot;</p>
