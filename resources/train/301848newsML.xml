<p>Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace turned back the clock in his vision of style into the new millenium on Sunday while Valentino gilded classic male elegance with a touch of glitz at the start of the Milan shows.</p>
<p>Versace, unveiling his 1997/98 autumn/winter Gianni Versace, Versus and Istante collections, married end-of-the-century taste back to start-of-the-century elegance of the English gentleman.</p>
<p>High-buttoned, neat-collared jackets and knee-length frock coats were finished with stylish contrasting collars in alternative materials like velvet.</p>
<p>Tweeds, Prince of Wales checks and the occasional vibrant red tartan cloth for single and double-breasted jackets and coats cut a predominantly narrow, columnlike profile.</p>
<p>&quot;My interpretation of fashion tastes for the end of the century is far from all trends...dominated by the desire for extreme individuality,&quot; Versace said.</p>
<p>The designer aimed for a classic look he called &quot;Baroque minimalism&quot; in his top line Versace collection, using a palette of sophisticated dark blues, forest green and hints of mustard.</p>
<p>Hints of futurism crept in with a pristine white turtleneck pullover matched with white pants and a long white coat.</p>
<p>For the young man about town came torso-tight long-sleeved tops in trademark Versace purple, yellow and red, some with a bold motif and reminiscent of shirts worn by galaxy trotters in the popular U.S. film and television series Star Trek.</p>
<p>Valentino Man combined classic elegance of double-breasted suits and knee or calf length coats with a splash of opulence from gold embroidered ties and cardigans trimmed with a generous swathe of rabbit fur at the collar.</p>
<p>For conservative dressers came chalk stripe flannels and the subtle grace of double-breasted wool suits in navy with double vents and two flapped pockets as well as turtleneck pullovers in charcoal grey, olive green and camel.</p>
<p>But Valentino threw in some spice by setting dusky blues and amethyst off against burgundy trousers and placing pale, creamy see-through knits over pepper red shirts.</p>
<p>&quot;The perfection of luxury is never ostentatious but rather a very strong yet discreet appeal of shades stolen from precious stones, from... powder and milk, from tapestries and damask,&quot; Valetino said.</p>
<p>For casual outdoors came a mint-coloured short sheepskin coat with a neat Nehru collar worn over a brick-coloured cashmere turtleneck and herringbone trousers, and a short black velvet double breasted coat with alternate panels of diagonal ribbing and horizontal ribbing.</p>
<p>Designers parading their collections on Monday include Krizia, fashion duo Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Gianfranco Ferre as well as Britain's Vivienne Westwood.</p>
<p>The shows run until Thursday, when top designer Giorgio Armani provides the finale to the five-day event.</p>
