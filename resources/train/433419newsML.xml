<title>USA: Nike shares fall on rumors of lost orders.</title>
<headline>Nike shares fall on rumors of lost orders.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>The stock of Nike Inc. slid in heavy trading Tuesday after a footwear trade magazine reported that the industry leader might have lost some significant orders for the critical back-to-school season.</p>
<p>Nike's class B stock fell as low as $63 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was by far the most active issue with 6.1 million shares changing hands. It closed 62.5 cents lower at $66.375.</p>
<p>Sporting Goods Intelligence cited &quot;outside sources&quot; in its report that retailer Big Foot had cancelled some Nike futures orders.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers analyst Brett Barakett called the magazine report &quot;rumors ... unsubstantiated and untrue.&quot;</p>
<p>He repeated his strong recommendation to buy Nike's stock, citing its recent low prices. &quot;This is a very compelling investment right now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gruntal raised its rating on the stock to outperformer from long-term outperformer.</p>
<p>Also, Woolworth Corp. said a market rumour that its sporting good retail unit, Foot Locker, had reduced its orders from Nike were untrue.</p>
<p>A Nike spokesman said the Beaverton, Ore.-based company could not comment on the magazine report because it is in the quiet period before the upcoming release of its fiscal third-quarter earnings.</p>
