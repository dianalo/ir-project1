<title>UK: UK ex-minister drops libel case over Saudi links.</title>
<headline>UK ex-minister drops libel case over Saudi links.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>British former cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken dropped his libel action against a newspaper and a television channel on Friday over allegations about his links to Saudi business associates.</p>
<p>Aitken, who quit the cabinet in 1995 to fight the libel actions saying he would use the &quot;sword of truth&quot; and the &quot;shield of fair play&quot; to clear his name, now faces costs estimated by media reports at nearly two million pounds ($3.2 million).</p>
<p>Aitken's lawyer gave no reason for dropping the action, which came a day after the Guardian newspaper and Granada Television said they had uncovered new evidence which cast doubt on the former minister's defence.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old sued over allegations made in 1995 that he was financially dependent upon the Saudis, procured prostitutes for them and tried to arrange arms sales to Iraq at the height of the Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p>He also denied allowing a Saudi associate to pay for a stay at the luxurious Ritz hotel in Paris and later lying to civil servants about the affair.</p>
<p>Aitken, who said his reputation had been &quot;butchered&quot; by the case, on Thursday announced he and his wife had separated.</p>
<p>During the 12-day case he denied lying but at various point admitted a &quot;lack of candour&quot;, confessed to &quot;dissembling&quot; and said a letter he sent to a senior civil servant about the affair had been subject to &quot;sharp editing&quot;.</p>
