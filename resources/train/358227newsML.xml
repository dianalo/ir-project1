<p>Alabama Gov. Fob James urged lawmakers to &quot;prune&quot; the state's four-year and junior college systems by 10 percent each in order to reduce waste and duplication and free up money for scholarships.</p>
<p>In his state-of-the state address Tuesday night, James said Alabama, which has 4.2 million people, will spend $962 million on higher education this year, 33 percent more than Louisiana, which has a similar population.</p>
<p>In order to match Alabama's per-capita appropriation, surrounding states would have to increase their per capita spending by 25 to 60 percent, the governor said.</p>
<p>Among his suggestions were to fold the state's 15 four-year colleges and universities into two systems, Alabama and Auburn, with the president of the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa in charge of the former and the president of Auburn University heading the latter.</p>
<p>Alternatively, James said, the state could create a board of regents to oversee four-year colleges and enact efficiencies.</p>
<p>He proposed leaving the state's two-year junior colleges and technical schools under governance of the state Board of Education, but also pruning them by 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;From these savings, we will have a merit schoolarship trust fund of $100 million per year to enable 75,000 Alabama students to attend the college if their choice,&quot; James said.</p>
<p>He praised lawmakers for adopting earlier reforms in the public schools, saying this year's budget would boost funding for grakes K-12 by almost $500,000 without raising taxes.</p>
<p>He said the industrial incentives the state had adopted had attracted new industry, helping reduce Alabama's unemployment rate to an all-time low of four percent.</p>
<p>Additionally, James said, the state has used competitive bidding, cost cuts and wage freezes to cut the state workforce by 3,138 and save taxpayers $60 million.</p>
<p>&quot;There is absolutely no need for new or increased state taxes, as this year's general fund has a projected surplus of some $40 million,&quot; James said. &quot;And with continued good stewardship, the day may be near when state taxes can be cut.&quot;</p>
<p>The governor said his proposed budget would appropriate an additional $33 million for child welfare and protection programs. He urged lawmakers to further support children by enacting laws to help locate Alabama's 70,000 deadbeat parents, who owe nearly $1 billion in back child support payments.</p>
<p>Tracking the deadbeats could be done partly by requiring businesses to report new hires to the Department of Industrial Relations, he said.</p>
<p>James urged support for his proposed $700 million bond issue, which would speed up four-laning of major highways, add urban loops, and provide $83 million to repair rural roads and bridges. Debt service would be repaid from existing gasoline taxes.</p>
<p>The governor renewed his call for tort reforms that would cap punitive damage awards at $750,000 except in wrongful death actions. He also urged lawmakers to establish criminal fraud laws, which the state currently lacks, establishing penalties of up to 10 years in jail and fines up to $5,000 or double the ill-gotten gain.</p>
