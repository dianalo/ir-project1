<headline>Singapore rubber sleepy, buyers await leads.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-08-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>A quiet tone pervaded the Singapore rubber market by midday as the trade waited for leads with some hoping buying will emerge later on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just getting started on the day. Nobody among the major consumers has called up yet so we're waiting for some leads from Japan,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rest of the trade was just beginning to trickle in after attending an industry meeting in the Indonesian resort of Bali over the weekend.  </p>
<p>&quot;We'll start making our calls in the afternoon. That's the time the consumers will start sniffing around for any purchases,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The market was still a bit nervous about the wobbly state of Southeast Asian currencies, prompting some players to stay cautiously on the sidelines. &quot;There's still some anxiety about the currency market,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>At 0445 GMT, September RSS3 was indicated at 94.50 U.S. cents a kg from 95.25 cents. September RSS1 was indicated at 139.50 Singapore cents (95 U.S. cents) a kg from 139.75 cents. -- (S$1.46 = US$1) - Rene Pastor (65-8703305)</p>
