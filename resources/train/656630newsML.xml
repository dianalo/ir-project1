<text>
<p>NYMEX electricity futures settled higher Thursday in a choppy session despite softer spot physical prices in the West.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't seem to rally up and and we can't seem to sell off,&quot; said a Houston futures said, referring to Wednesday's rangebound activity that finished in a late slide.</p>
<p>Market sources said the power complex is struggling to find a direction amid the lack of fresh fundamental news and rangebound trading in natural gas futures.</p>
<p>July California-Oregon Border (COB) futures settled up 39 cents at $17.08 a megawatt hour (MWh) after bouncing in a 40 cent range.</p>
<p>August COB finished up four cents at $20.59. Deferred COB months ended down 21 cents to up 10 cents.</p>
<p>July Palo Verde (PV) settled up 27 cents at $26.76, about the middle of today's $26.55-27.10 trading range.</p>
<p>August PV finished up 11 cents at $28.91. Other active COB contracts ended mixed.</p>
<p>NYMEX July Henry Hub natgas futures settled up 0.9 cent at $2.080 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Under forecast of mild temperatures in the West, firm, peak Friday power prices at COB held steady at $14.50-15.50, while those at PV slipped to $21.00-22.50 from $22.75-23.75.</p>
<p>Several coal-fired power units in the West are expected to resume operation over the next several days: a 450 megawatt (MW) unit at the San Juan coal-fired plant in New Mexico, a 190 unit at the Hayden coal-fired station in Colorado and a 670 MW unit at the Centralia coal-fired station in Washington.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a 875 MW unit at the Intermountain coal-fired power plant in Utah is said to shut Friday through Sunday to repair a tube leak.station</p>
<p>Forecasters called temperatures in the Northwest to run near to above normal next week with bouts of unsettled weather conditions.</p>
<p>Fair and warm weather was expected to stay in the Southwest with readings averaging three to six degrees Fahrenheit above normal through the middle of next week.</p>
<p>Market sources said power futures will likely continue their rangebound pattern Friday.</p>
<p>Separately, a Western Systems Coordinating Council committee is expected to propose next week a summertime rating for the Pacific Intertie of 6,900 MW, down from the current springtime limit of 7,200 MW.</p>
<p>NYMEX estimated 786 COB and 751 PV contracts were sold, compared with Wednesday's 854 COB and 682 PV lots.</p>
