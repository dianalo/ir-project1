<p>South African trade union influence in investment markets was mushrooming through their participation in industry and employer-sponsored retirement funds, leading life assurer Old Mutual said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade unions...are becoming a force to be reckoned with in South Africa's investment markets,&quot; Old Mutual Actuaries &amp; Consultants director Pierre Pretorius said in a statement.</p>
<p>The union movement directly or indirectly controlled a growing body of investment capital and was likely to use its investment leverage to achieve greater influence over the direction of business, Pretorius said.</p>
<p>He said this development coincided with shareholders taking a more active role in the running of companies.</p>
<p>The recently released King report on Corporate Governance pointed out that directors were accountable to shareholders for the performance of the business. But, in the case of firms with a large number of shareholders and no controlling shareholders, directors often enjoyed a virtually free reign due to the passivity of shareholders, Pretorius said.</p>
<p>The report acknowledged &quot;a strongly held view&quot; among retirement fund members that they should participate more actively in the management of companies.</p>
