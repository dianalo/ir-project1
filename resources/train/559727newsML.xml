<title>USA: Acclaimed New York columnist Murray Kempton dies.</title>
<headline>Acclaimed New York columnist Murray Kempton dies.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Pulitzer prize-winning New York newspaper columnist Murray Kempton, whose erudite articles brought a gentle voice to a tough city, died early Monday, a family friend said. He was 79.</p>
<p>Kempton died in a Manhattan nursing home of apparent heart failure, but he had been suffering from cancer that was diagnosed last winter, said his colleague Chiara Coletti, who is also a friend of the Kempton family.</p>
<p>During his career as a journalist he worked for the New York Post, the New York Review of Books, the New York World Telegram, and as a commentator for CBS and Newsday of Long Island.</p>
<p>His New York colleagues loved him and hailed him among the best newspaper columnists who ever lived, but his more than 10,000 columns never had much appeal west of the Hudson River.</p>
<p>In his articles he wrote about individuals at important moments in history, including communists, labour leaders, mobsters, movie stars and baseball players. He worked as a publicity director, writer, labour reporter, assistant editor, labour editor, columnist and free-lance writer.</p>
<p>&quot;The man has brought more honour to newspapers than anyone in my lifetime,&quot; Jimmy Breslin, a fellow-columnist at Newsday, once said of Kempton.</p>
<p>Others who knew the pipe-smoking Kempton said he was often seen cycling around Manhattan's residential Upper West Side. Colleagues remember him as someone who was always ready to offer help to young reporters or take on any assignment.</p>
<p>&quot;The prizes he won, the things he did were something you would never hear from him,&quot; CBS News radio reporter Irene Cornell said in an on-air tribute to her colleague. &quot;He was a very caring, gentle man. He would come up with the kind of intricate, intellectual observations that would make his columns gems of thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Kempton won many awards for his books and journalism, including a Pulitzer Prize, which won for commentary in 1985 while he was at Newsday, a newspaper he wrote for from 1981 until his death.</p>
<p>He tried to establish a reputation for fairness and once stated that &quot;there's no excuse for kicking somebody unless he's up.&quot;</p>
<p>Generally considered a political liberal, although he disdained such labels, he had an intriguing friendship of sorts with Republican President Richard Nixon, who resigned the presidency in 1974 over the Watergate scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;Nixon liked me because he'd known me for a long while,&quot; Kempton told David Remnick in an interview for a 1993 profile in New Yorker magazine. &quot;Once I got my balance in about 1962 and stopped blaming everything on one guy, I just sort of got fond of him.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, Kempton was touched when Nixon wrote to him from the White House in 1971 after the death of Kempton's son Mike and his wife in a car accident.</p>
<p>Kempton was born in Baltimore in 1917. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1939 and served in the Army in New Guinea and the Philippines during World War II.</p>
<p>Of his frightening war experience -- he and his fellow-soldiers were ambushed by the Japanese in the Philippines -- he said: &quot;The one thing about being ambushed is that you can never take yourself very seriously again.&quot;</p>
<p>He is survived by four children and two grandchildren.</p>
