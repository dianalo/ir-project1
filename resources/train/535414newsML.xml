<p>A report by Brazil's Central Bank containing 1997 economic forecasts projected a seven to eight percent inflation and a seven percent devaluation against the dollar this year, Brazil's leading newspapers reported Thursday.</p>
<p>The internal report, mistakenly distributed to reporters on Wednesday, also forecasts a real annual interest rates of 12 percent, O Globo said.  </p>
<p>In a late Wednesday news conference shown on television on Thursday, Central Bank director Alkimar Moura said the projected seven percent devaluation of the real currency against the dollar is a forecast based on a internal study, not a goal the bank will seek to meet.</p>
<p>The Brazilian real has slid gradually this year under a system of mini-band targets set by the central bank.</p>
<p>Moura spoke to the reporters late Wednesday after the central bank realized it had erroneously given the internal report to the media.  </p>
<p>The document's projections came as no surprise because they are in line with private sector economists' forecasts.</p>
<p>The report, as reported in Brazilian newspapers, also showed bank loans to individuals rose only 1.9 percent to 79.5 billion reais on March 20 from 78.05 billion reais at end-February, the financial daily Gazeta Mercantil said.</p>
<p>The slight credit expansion indicates that measures to curb consumption would be unnecessary for the moment, Gazeta said.</p>
<p>Although government officials have repeatedly said they see no need for credit restrictions now, market analysts speculate the National Monetary Council (NMC) could take some measures when it meets later today.</p>
<p>The NMC, Brazil's highest monetary policies includes top officials from the central bank, finance ministry and planning ministry.</p>
