<title>UK: Euro insurers face five billion pound EMU conversion bill.</title>
<headline>Euro insurers face five billion pound EMU conversion bill.</headline>

<p>Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will cost the European insurance industry some 5.0 billion pounds ($8.4 billion), consulting and computer services group Cap Gemini said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The information technology costs will be in the region of 3.2 billion pounds and the total costs across Europe will be around 5.0 billion pounds,&quot; Richard Wood, head of the EMU team at Cap Gemini insurance, told a news conference.</p>
<p>The findings were based on a survey of 200 European insurers carried out for Cap Gemini in May by UK-based management consultancy Datamonitor.</p>
<p>The average cost for a large international insurance group would be 50 million pounds, falling to up to five million for a small insurer, Wood said.</p>
<p>EMU is due to start on January 1, 1999, with a transition phase until 2002, although not all European countries are expected to join at that stage.</p>
<p>Insurers are focusing their preparations for EMU on their investment operations, followed by finance, retail insurance and corporate insurance.</p>
<p>Preparation time was gauged at two to three years for large companies and three years or more for small to medium-size companies.</p>
<p>More than 60 percent of insurers in Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands could give the size of their EMU implementation budget.</p>
<p>This compared with 50 percent in Austria, 35 percent in Britain, fewer than 30 percent in Italy, Finland and Spain, seven percent in Sweden and none in Denmark.</p>
<p>Many British insurers said they did not expect Britain to join EMU until 2001 but Cap Gemini Insurance executive director Bill Lang said they were nonetheless dangerously underprepared.</p>
<p>EMU is not expected to lead to an overnight revolution in the way Europeans buy insurance, although it will open up opportunities for some.</p>
<p>&quot;EMU takes us one more step towards a single European market for insurance but this alone won't create a single market. You won't have everyone in Britain buying their insurance from Allianz in 1999,&quot; said Jo Owen, vice president of Gemini Consulting.</p>
<p>Insurers in some countries are more optimistic than others.</p>
<p>&quot;While 53 percent of respondents anticipate new products and services and 55 percent believe that new markets will open up, particularly on the corporate side, opinions differ markedly between countries.&quot;</p>
<p>Some 80 percent of Italian insurers expect EMU to open up new markets, while the figure drops to 40 percent in France and Germany.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of large companies expect to be ready to meet the January 1999 deadline for EMU, while two-thirds of smaller companies will use the transition period of dual currency operation to 2002 to complete the conversion.</p>
<p>Potential problems cited by many companies include uncertainty about the exact impact of EMU, problems with existing systems, a shortage of skilled information technology staff and a shortage of other skills.</p>
<p>Some companies said they would jointly incorporate the changes necessary for EMU with those for the millennium but Wood said that the two presented very different challenges.</p>
<p>Datamonitor calculated that German insurers face the largest bill for EMU at around 850 million stg, followed by Britain at 740 million, France at more than 650 million and the Netherlands at around 300 million. ($ = 0.596 British Pounds)</p>
