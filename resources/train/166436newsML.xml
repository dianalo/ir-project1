<p>South Korean troops on Tuesday killed two North Korean agents who had been on the run since September, but lost three men in a fierce gun battle, officials said.</p>
<p>The two agents were among 26 North Koreans whose submarine ran aground off the eastern city of Kangnung on September 17, a military spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our troops killed two members of the enemy's reconnaissance team after fierce exchanges of gunfire with the armed infiltrators&quot; on the hills of Inje near the east coast, spokesman Kang Joong-kwon said.</p>
<p>Two South Korean officers and a soldier were also killed when the North Korean agents opened fire with M-16 automatic rifles and hurled grenades at pursuing South Korean troops near the border with the communist North, Seoul officials said.</p>
<p>About a dozen other South Korean soldiers were wounded.</p>
<p>Only one of the original 26 North Korean infiltrators is still at large. Officials have said 13 were shot dead, one captured and eleven others killed themselves.</p>
<p>Kang did not say how the two fugitive North Koreans were identified but one senior officer said Lee Kwang-soo, the captured North Korean, was sent to the scene to name them.</p>
<p>The Shark-class submarine ran aground off Kangnung as it tried to pick up three North Koreans it offloaded two days earlier, according to Lee. Kang said the two killed on Tuesday were among the three spies.</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry spokesman said the infiltrators were wearing South Korean military uniforms and carried the same kind of rifles used in the South.</p>
<p>&quot;But they used bullets which did not carry serial numbers. All ammunition used by our side bear serial numbers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>South Korean special forces had been combing the rugged east coast mountains just south of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) since Monday when the two infiltrators fled after being stopped by southern soldiers, he said.</p>
<p>The DMZ was set up between the two Koreas under the 1953 armistice agreement which ended the three-year Korean War. The two Koreas are still technically at war.</p>
<p>Tension has remained high on the peninsula, the world's last cold war frontier, since the stranded submarine was spotted by an alert taxi driver in Kangnung.</p>
<p>Tuesday's gun battle occurred as the United States and South Korea staged a two-week military training exercise to develop defences against any attack from the communist North.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Chales Moore, commander of the U.S. aircraft carrier Independence battle group, said last week South Korea faced the threat of seaborne saboteurs, but Washington would send aircraft to defend it if war broke out on the peninsula.</p>
<p>The exercise, called Foal Eagle '96, involves about 34,000 U.S. troops including 10,000 seamen from the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and most of South Korea's 655,000 military personnel.</p>
<p>President Kim Young-sam on Tuesday told a meeting with senior policymakers on North Korea that Seoul would continue efforts to maintain superior military power against the North.</p>
<p>&quot;We will sternly deal with any provocation by North Korea,&quot; he said. &quot;North Korea will have to realise that they have to pay a price for a provocation.&quot; He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Seoul has demanded a &quot;clear apology&quot; from Pyongyang over the submarine incursion. North Korea has threatened to retaliate &quot;a hundredfold or a thousandfold&quot; over the killings and requested the return of the bodies, the survivors and the submarine.</p>
