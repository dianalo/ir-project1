<title>LEBANON: Lebanese pound loses ground against dollar.</title>

<p>The Lebanese pound fell  against the dollar in interbank trade on Thursday amid strong demand for the U.S. currency by a local bank, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;One bank demanded a big amount of dollars in the last three days and that created some pressure on the market. This slowed interbank trade after the pound fell back to 1,546 per dollar,&quot; Talal Abou Zaki, Forex Manager for Bank Beirut and the Arab Countries told Reuters.</p>
<p>This was 4.5 pounds more than last week's closing interbank rate of 1,541.5, but within the central bank's bid-offer trading band which stood at 1,540-1,549.5 pounds per dollar.</p>
<p>Abou Zaki said banks traded the dollar on Thursday at between 1,544 and 1,546 pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;If demand for dollars continues tomorrow like this the interbank rate could exceed 1,549.5 pound per dollar,&quot; Abou Zaki said.</p>
<p>This could bring central bank intervention to keep the pound within its trading band.</p>
<p>However, Abou Zaki said there was no reason to believe the situation was caused by concern about the pound on the market. &quot;I believe the demand for dollars is just caused by the issue of a big deal by this one bank,&quot; he said.</p>
