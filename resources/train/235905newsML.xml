<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu played down tensions with Arabs during a visit to Spain, saying problems in the Middle East peace process were not as bad as they seemed.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, in Madrid to mark five years since the landmark 1991 Middle East peace conference, said late on Tuesday he was trying to dispel the image in Europe of his government as hardline and opposed to peace.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll tell you why I'm concerned. Because there is no foundation for the picture that emanates from the Arab capitals,&quot; Netanyahu said at a joint news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.</p>
<p>Netanyahu rejected accusations of &quot;foot-dragging&quot; in the implementation of an agreement with Palestinians on the West Bank town of Hebron and of keeping Palestinians away from jobs in Israel with closures.</p>
<p>&quot;The third thing we are accused of is unbridled expansion of the settlements. Well, I can only say I wish that were true,&quot; he said, referring to Jewish settlements on occupied Arab land.</p>
<p>The Israeli leader said his government was expanding settlements at a slower pace than the previous Labour government due to bureaucratic and budgetary constraints but added he wished that were not so.</p>
<p>He said Palestinians, not Israelis, were stalling on the accord for a partial troop withdrawal from Hebron which he claimed had been &quot;98 percent complete&quot; for the last month.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing in the outstanding issues in Hebron that couldn't be resolved in one meeting between Arafat and myself,&quot; the Israeli leader said.</p>
<p>In response to charges Israel was not abiding by international agreements, he pledged to honour the commitments and again directed the same charge back at Palestinians whom he said had violated agreements on security.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I'm concerned, we are continuing the Madrid peace process,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>Regarding Syria, Netanyahu said Israel wanted to resume peace talks but Damascus was not interested. He said tensions over troop movements around the disputed Golan Heights were abating and he believed talks would resume in a few months.</p>
<p>Netanyahu was invited by the Spanish government to come on or around the October 31 anniversary of the Madrid peace conference where Israel sat around a negotiating table with all its Arab neighbours for the first time.</p>
<p>Spain issued a separate invitation to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who came on the anniversary.</p>
<p>Before the news conference, Netanyahu met privately with Aznar and also saw King Juan Carlos. He addressed several hundred members of Madrid's small Jewish community at the central synagogue earlier.</p>
<p>Aznar said he and Netanyahu had exchanged information on terrorism in their meeting.</p>
<p>Netanyahu came to Spain from a European security summit in Lisbon where he said European leaders, trying to play a greater role in Middle East peacemaking, had not hidden &quot;their questions or criticisms&quot; of Israel. Netanyahu tried to counter the criticism.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have been remiss in Israel in blocking out Europe as though Europe were some kind of enemy in this process,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that Israel had ignored Europe in its preoccupation with U.S. government and public opinion and vowed to intensify an exchange of information with Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not made our case in Europe. We have not invested the time to inform European opinion and sometimes even governmental opinion, and I think that has to change. This is why I'm here, among other things.&quot;</p>
