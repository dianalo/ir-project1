<headline>Zaire says Libya to help it fight rebels.</headline>

<p>Libya has agreed to help Zaire in its planned counter-offensive against Rwandan-backed rebels, official Radio Zaire said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It did not state the nature of Tripoli's assistance but said this was the subject of wide-ranging talks between the visiting Libyan Foreign Minister and senior Zaire government officials.</p>
<p>&quot;The message of Libya's foreign minister is clear. Libya will assist Zaire in retaking the lost territories,&quot; the radio said, quoting the Libyan minister, Omar Mustafa al-Montasser.</p>
<p>&quot;Libya is against foreign interference in Zaire's internal affairs and says that Zaire's territorial integrity must be restored,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>It added that Egypt, whose special envoy was also visiting Kinshasa, shared the same view.</p>
<p>Montasser arrived in Zaire from Cameroon on Monday, the day Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo formally ordered the beleaguered Zairean army to go on the offensive against the rebels who have captured a large stretch of eastern Zaire bordering Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi since last October.</p>
<p>Libya is one of several countries widely rumoured in Kinshasa to be helping Zaire with its buildup to the counter- offensive against the rebels. France, China and Iran are others.</p>
<p>President Mobutu Sese Seko paid a rare official visit to Libya in 1995 although the two countries do not have a history of warm relations.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who spent four months in Europe after cancer surgery, returned home briefly in December and reshuffled the government and military leadership with a view to hitting back at the rebels.</p>
