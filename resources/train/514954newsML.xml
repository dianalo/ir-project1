<headline>Allianz starts Holocaust claims hotline.</headline>
<dateline>MUNICH, Germany 1997-04-16</dateline>

<p>Germany's Allianz AG Holding, one of the insurers named in a multi-billion-dollar U.S. lawsuit alleging Holocaust survivors were cheated of their assets, said on Wednesday it had opened a hotline to assist claimants.</p>
<p>The top German insurer also detailed steps it had taken to clarify issues from the Nazi era and pledged to answer queries &quot;as quickly and completely as possible&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We owe it to the victims of the Holocaust, their families, and also to our own corporate integrity to answer all questions on this issue that are still open,&quot; Allianz said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed late last month charges seven European insurers with concealing or converting the cash value and proceeds of insurance policies sold prior to 1946 to victims of Nazi persecution.</p>
<p>The class action suit, combining the claims of an estimated 10,000 plaintiffs, said insurers had earlier encouraged Europeans fearing persecution to deposit assets with them and buy insurance to safeguard their families' futures.</p>
<p>Allianz has pledged to examine any outstanding claims and deal with them with minimum red tape but has also said it did not expect many cases to be uncovered. Auditing firm Arthur Andersen is to conduct an independent examination of its files.</p>
<p>&quot;Should any cases, contrary to present knowledge, be found to be still open, Allianz will contact those involved,&quot; the giant insurance group said.</p>
<p>Many of the cases still open appeared to relate to people who lived in eastern Europe before the second World War.</p>
<p>&quot;Their unsettled claims were not recognised by the communist governments in the east,&quot; Allianz said.</p>
<p>&quot;These post-war governments confiscated all assets of foreign insurers in the region and, together with their monopoly insurance companies, became the legal successors of the formerly private insurers.&quot;</p>
<p>Allianz said its management board had in early March commissioned a team of historians, lead by a U.S. expert, to produce an independent account of Allianz under the Nazi dictatorship.</p>
<p>The hotline, with the German telephone number +49 89 41864 413, will be available 24-hours a day and an additional hotline will be set up in the U.S.. Allianz said advertisements would be placed in newspapers in Europe, the U.S. and Israel.</p>
<p>Other defendants in the U.S. case include Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. of Trieste, Italy, Wiener Allianz Versicherungs AG and Der Anker Allgemeine Versicherungs AG of Vienna, A.G.F. Assurances Generales de France Vie of Paris, Riunione Adriatica Di Sicurta S.p.A. of Milan and Bavarian Reinsurance Co of Munich.</p>
