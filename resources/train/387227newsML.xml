<p>Twelve Atlanta Olympic gold medallists from China will arrive in Taiwan on Thursday in the latest sports exchange between the two political rivals, Taiwan's state-funded Central News Agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation, which includes women's 5,000 metres gold medallist Wang Junxia and eight coaches, was invited by Taiwan's education ministry to help promote sports development on the island, the agency said.</p>
<p>Men's gymnastics all-round winner Li Xiaoshuang and women's diving gold medallist Fu Mingxia are among other members of the delegation, which will visit training centres and conduct informal clinics before leaving on February 28.</p>
<p>Although Taiwan and China have been political rivals since they split after a civil war ended in 1949, cultural and economic ties have flourished with an unofficial thaw that began in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The two sides competed in the same Olympics for the first time at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.</p>
<p>Since then star athletes from China have come to Taiwan frequently to compete and promote sports links.</p>
<p>Unlike Beijing's government-backed sports juggernaut that hauled in 16 golds in Atlanta in 1996, Taiwan only won a silver medal -- and the lone winner, table tennis star Chen Jing, was a former Olympic gold medallist from the mainland.</p>
<p>Chen lost to China's Deng Yaping in the women's singles final.</p>
