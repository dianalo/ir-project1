<title>UK: Closing stock market indices.</title>
<headline>Closing stock market indices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Monday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's FTSE 100 index finished at the day's best levels Monday, underpinned by a firm bond market and boosted in the last half-hour of trade by a sharp turnaround on Wall Street. The leading index ended 20 points higher at 4,389.7, despite suffering a weaker opening and relatively quiet trade ahead of Thursday's national election.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German stocks treaded water for most of Monday's market trade, but the DAX share index ended lower as support from a stronger dollar was outweighed by investor scepticism about the viability of further gains.</p>
<p>A lower close on Wall Street Friday evening also helped tip the balance against German stocks.</p>
<p>The DAX index ended down 14.21 points, or 0.42 percent, at 3,363.06 points amid poor volumes. In after-market trading, the DAX stood at 3,372.96, up 15.39 points.</p>
<p>PARIS - French stocks finished higher Monday, bolstered by polls showing the ruling coalition set to win an upcoming parliamentary election and a stronger dollar. The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 13.99 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,550.25, while the CAC-40 April futures contract rose 17 points to 2,562.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss stocks ended higher after a quiet day with investors largely on the sidelines ahead of various U.S. economic data later in the week. Sentiment was generally good against the backdrop of a firming U.S. dollar and the favourable interest rate environment, one dealer said.</p>
<p>The Blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended up 21.0 points, or 0.44 percent, at 4,793.3 points, after touching 4,801.8.</p>
<p>The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) ended at 3,037.56 points, up 13.32 points, or 0.44 percent, from Friday's close.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed mixed Monday in extremely light trading as Sunday's Group of Seven (G7) meeting failed to provide fresh incentives to the stock market, and most participants were unwilling to move actively before a holiday Tuesday. The key 225-share Nikkei average closed up 57.51 points or 0.31 percent at 18,670.37, after hovering within a limited range throughout the session.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Late profit-taking in Hong Kong's hot red-chip sector of Chinese stocks and caution ahead of this week's heavy calendar of U.S. economic data dragged share prices to a lower close Monday.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed down 35.59 points, or 0.28 percent, at 12,610.17. Turnover was HK$13.91 billion, with the focus mainly on China plays vs. HK$15.15 billion Friday.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian stock market closed lower Monday, trailing softer U.S. markets lower in a day of light, choppy trading. Trading was generally quiet, with the local market playing catch-up to two days of Wall Street weakness after the ANZAC day holiday weekend. Turnover figures were inflated by A$773 million of pre-opening trades related to April series options exercises.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index ended 13.0 points lower at 2,461.7.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African markets were closed Monday for a public holiday.</p>
