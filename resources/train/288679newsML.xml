<title>USA: Sen Moynihan to reintroduce stadiums bill Jan 21.</title>
<headline>Sen Moynihan to reintroduce stadiums bill Jan 21.</headline>

<p>U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, (D-NY), who shook the municipal bond market last year when he introduced a bill to bar use of tax-exempt bonds for professional sports stadiums, will reintroduce the measure on January 21, a Moynihan aide said on Monday.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Moynihan will reoffer a bill that would eliminate a federal curb on bond issuance that the senator says denies tax-exempt financing to large, private research institutions, the aide said.</p>
<p>That curb sets a $150 million cap on the amount of tax-exempt bonds that nonhospital 501(c)(3) organizations can have outstanding, the aide said.</p>
<p>Moynihan is reintroducing both bills on January 21, the first day that Senate leaders say members can offer bills in the 105th Congress.</p>
<p>House members, however, have the go-ahead from their leaders to introduce what is expected to be an avalanche of bills beginning tomorrow, January 7.</p>
<p>The Moynihan aide said the stadiums bill would have an effective date of when the Senate Finance Committee votes on the measure.</p>
<p>Moynihan's original bill had a June 14, 1996 effective data. He agreed to delay the effective date when bond dealers and issuers said the deadline had a chilling effect on some some major stadium financings and the market for stadium bonds.</p>
<p>Moynihan's aide said his boss may include some exemptions in the new bill, such as for a stadium &quot;where the dollars are too small to be a problem or worth the effort.&quot;</p>
<p>An example of such a &quot;de minimis&quot; rule might be for a $1 million minor league stadium, the aide said. He stressed that the $1 million figure is an arbitary one.</p>
<p>Another exemption could involve charitable sports events, the aide said.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, some football teams play a game over at college campus where the proceeds go to the college (which is) a 501(c)(3),&quot; he said. &quot;Or maybe some sports team plays for the United Way,&quot; the aide said.</p>
<p>&quot;That type of use involves the tax subsidy inuring to the benefit of a charity,&quot; the aide said.</p>
