<p>A brother and sister were killed when a tunnel they were digging in wet sand collapsed on them, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The children -- Sequoia Snowtree, 9, and his sister Sierra Rose O'Loughlin, 7 -- were reported missing Monday evening from a home in Manila, near Eureka, 200 miles north of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Their mother told sheriff's deputies that the children were last seen playing around the house six hours earlier, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Department said.</p>
<p>Sheriff's deputies joined the mother and neighbours in searching for the children. The mother, whose name was not released, found the bodies of the children behind the house where they had been digging a tunnel in wet sand.</p>
<p>The tunnel apparently collapsed on the children, trapping them under the sand and suffocating them, the sheriff's department said.</p>
