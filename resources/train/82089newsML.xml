<p>U.S. economic data have the potential to pummel over-sensitive financial markets in the week ahead, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>With U.S. interest rates likely to be on hold for at least six weeks, analysts said September's National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) index on Tuesday and the sometimes deadly non-farm payroll on Friday could topple bond prices and dent the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk is that if we do get strong numbers it is going to leave the Treasury market vulnerable,&quot; said Huw Roberts.</p>
<p>&quot;And if the Treasuries get a jolt, that could well feed back into European markets,&quot; said Roberts, a European bond strategist at NatWest Capital markets in London.</p>
<p>Analysts polled by Reuters are forecasting that 192,000 jobs will have been added in September versus 250,000 in August, but as ever the predictions span a wide range.</p>
<p>Patrick Mange, head of research at Deutsche Bank in Paris said he expected a lower number -- around 175,000 -- but said the key figure would be the unemployment rate. &quot;We are forecasting that will be slightly higher at 5.3 percent,&quot; he said. Reuters' poll has a forecast of 5.2 percent versus 5.1 percent in August.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the NAPM index will set the tone for the U.S. until the payroll takes over. The index is expected to rise to 52.8 from 52.6 last month.</p>
<p>In Europe, analysts said investors should watch out for German industrial production numbers due from Wednesday, and Italian consumer price data on Friday.</p>
<p>Optimism about European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is running high, and Italian bonds and the lira can look forward to another good week if CPI data show inflation continuing to fall.</p>
<p>In France, financial markets can check up on the economy when the INSEE September survey is released on Monday.</p>
<p>The 51st annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington continues into next week, and analysts say there may be a few snippets for currency markets to contend with.</p>
<p>&quot;With the U.S. growing quite strongly and Japan coming out of recession, they may have less to talk about than normal,&quot; said Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign exchange rates are not a million miles from where they would want them, although they might like the dollar a little higher,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Policy-makers from the group of seven (G7) developed nations meet on Saturday on the fringes of the World bank meeting.</p>
<p>Politics will also take centre stage in Britain, where the party conference season continues next week with the main opposition left-of-centre Labour party.</p>
<p>In Japan, industrial production and housing starts data are due on Monday and August unemployment numbers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Japan's jobless rate to remain steady at 3.4 percent.</p>
