<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Wednesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>--Pension fund LD has decided to drop proceeedings against Den Danske Bank over the sale of shares in Hafnia insurance. Disgruntled investors say that Den Danske Bank was negligent in selling its customers shares in Hafnia shortly before it went bankrupt in 1992. LD decided to drop its action after Den Danske made public a written reply to another claimant in which it said that nobody could have foreseen Hafnia's collapse.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--Mortgage lender Realkredit Danmark has formed a sales alliance with Totalkredit allowing it to sell its variable interest rate loans in Totalkredit's  62 regional and local banks.</p>
<p>--A new survey shows that 27 percent of newly-constructed buildings in Denmark were found to have serious defects. Researchers say the problem comes from downward price pressure from buyers, forcing builders to work faster and cut corners.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS-POSTEN</p>
<p>--Norway's oil and gas revenues are increasing outward investment, with Denmark as a favoured target for aquisitions and the head of Norway's Christiana Bank in Copenhagen sees more buyups on the way.</p>
<p>&quot;We are experiencing very great interest from Norwegian businesses at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>--Danish public coffers are missing revenue of about 35-40 million crowns each year on the value of free bonus air journeys which the recipients do not declare on their tax returns. Tax authorities plan a crackdown. SAS says it is not obliged to give the tax office details of free flights.</p>
<p>BORSEN</p>
<p>--New competitors in the recently deregulated Danish telecommunications market suffered a serious blow from an EU ruling that means incumbents Tele Danmark and Sonfon are not obliged to allow rivals access to their mobile phone networks. Newcomer Telia is considering taking the case to competition authorities.</p>
