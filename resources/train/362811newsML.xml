<p>African robusta producers will meet discuss to export limit quotas on February 26-27 after a January world agreement in Rio de Janeiro to shore up prices, Ivory Coast's Commodities Minister told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>Gauze, who is also chairman of the Interafrican Coffee Organisation, gave no venue details but said African robusta exporters would afterwards seek to meet other producers.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a meeting to decide how to divide export limits between African producers,&quot; said Gauze. &quot;The meeting will be for two days, on February 26 and February 27,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We will then call on other producers for a meeting,&quot; he said without giving agenda details.</p>
<p>Gauze on February 5 called off talks in Bali with Asian robusta producers.</p>
<p>The world Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) decided on January 23 to cut robusta exports by one million bags (60 kg) after low prices seen in late 1996.</p>
<p>The limitation was expected to be shared between African and Asian producers.</p>
<p>&quot;The talks have been postponed,&quot; Gauze said after returning to Ivory Coast to attend cocoa sector reform with International Cocoa Organisation and donor officials.</p>
<p>Indonesian officials told Reuters export cut sharing between Africa and Asia had not been discussed as the Bali meeting.</p>
<p>Gauze said African producers would discuss how to divide Africa's export limitation share, which he said was 850,000 bags, between exporting countries.</p>
<p>IACO chief economist this week delined to comment on African sharing arrangements saying the decision was an internal IACO matter.</p>
<p>Indonesia has decided to reduce its exports by 150,000 bags in the January to June 1997 period covered by the volutary export restraint.</p>
<p>ACPC members are concerned that rising production from non-ACPC member such as Vietnam will undermine their own export restraint policy.</p>
<p>Indonesia's ACPC representative Paian Nainggolan said informal discussions had taken place after Gauze cancelled his trip. No ACPC export cut sharing cut talks took place, he said.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast, Africa's largest exporter, expects to produce 230,000 tonnes in 1996/97 but local quality inspectors say quality problems mean not all of it will be exportable.</p>
