<p>Bayern Munich aim to be a publicly traded company within five years, reflecting their transformation from mere sports club to multi-million dollar business, says club vice-president Fritz Scherer.</p>
<p>Scherer told Wednesday's edition of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that German Soccer Federation (DFB) rules meant Bayern could currently not follow the path from stadium to stock exchange already beaten by several high-profile British clubs.</p>
<p>&quot;But I think that will have changed within the next five years,&quot; Scherer said, adding the DFB had already shown itself willing to be flexible.</p>
<p>Scherer said the club's current structure, with a few permanent employees and a board of honorary members such as himself and president Franz Beckenbauer, was outdated.</p>
<p>&quot;We grew out of it long ago. We've become a medium-sized company,&quot; he said. Bayern posted turnover of 147.4 million marks ($89 million) for its last financial year, up 17 percent on the previous year.</p>
<p>Several British clubs have gone public over the past few years. English champions Manchester United, who were floated in 1991, have grown to become one of Britain's 250 biggest quoted companies.</p>
<p>Scherer said Bayern had already formulated plans for a flotation. But he added the club would not want outside investors to take a majority stake, to prevent a possible hostile takeover.</p>
