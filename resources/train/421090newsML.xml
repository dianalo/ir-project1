<p>A Moroccan human rights group said on Wednesday that women in the North African country had made little progress to end discrimination against them.</p>
<p>Ahead of International Women's Day on March 8, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights said in a statement that illiteracy among women remained higher than among men.</p>
<p>They also suffered from sexual harassment and inequality in marriage, the group said, adding that the constitution guaranteed equal political rights for both sexes but not civil rights.</p>
<p>The government amended legislation three years ago so that women were not forced into marriage against their will and men could not take a second wife without their spouse's approval.</p>
<p>The group said women were still discriminated against over divorce, maintenance and the guardianship of children.</p>
