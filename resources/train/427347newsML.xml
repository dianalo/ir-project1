<title>UK: Spice Girls a hit with Thatcher and Fergie.</title>
<headline>Spice Girls a hit with Thatcher and Fergie.</headline>

<p>Britain's Duchess of York knows all their names, opposition leader Tony Blair managed only three out of five and Margaret Thatcher sent them a Christmas card.</p>
<p>The Spice Girls, a feisty quintet who say former prime minister Thatcher is their role model, dominate British pop music and shot to number one in the U.S hit parade with their first single, a feat never achieved by the Beatles.</p>
<p>But the Daily Mirror found some celebrities had trouble naming all five -- Mel C, Emma, Victoria, Geri and Mel B.</p>
<p>Opposition Labour Party leader Blair, who played lead guitar in a student pop group, could not remember the names of two members of the group when asked.</p>
<p>Thatcher revealed she had sent them a Christmas card and a spokeswoman for the Duchess of York said: &quot;She definitely knows their names.&quot;</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace refused to put the question to Princess Diana while romantic novelist Barbara Cartland declared: &quot;I have never heard of them. I much prefer dance music.&quot;</p>
