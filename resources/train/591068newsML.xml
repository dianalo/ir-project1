<p>IPE Brent crude futures traded flat on Friday, little moved by NYMEX's opening, brokers said.</p>
<p>July Brent, the new front month contract, was just a cent a barrel up at $19.50 a barrel by 1430 gmt, after trading in a narrow range. June gas oil was up $1 at $173 a tonne.</p>
<p>In New York June crude oil futures were down just one cent at $21.29 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;Its deadly quiet down here, we were looking at gasoline to come off when the NYMEX opened, which it did a little and then retraced. There is nothing going on,&quot; said one IPE broker.</p>
<p>Volumes were low, with less than 5,000 July lots traded.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market appeared set to fritter away the rest of the day, with no major news to shake them.</p>
<p>The market failed to flinch earlier at news of a lower North Sea Forties crude lifting schedule for June, which came in at 17.3 million barrels, compared to 22.45 million in May. This was broadly in line with market expectations.</p>
