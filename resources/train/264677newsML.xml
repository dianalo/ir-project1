<p>German shares ended bourse dealings with modest gains on Wednesday, encouraged by overnight gains on Wall Street and supported by a firmer dollar.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 top German shares closed up 5.62 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,820.75 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said news of weaker-than-expected November German M3 money supply growth of eight percent released in the morning had also been supportive for the market.</p>
<p>Traders said that in general the market was relatively quiet. &quot;The market is very calm with lots of people having already closed their books for the end of the year,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>After the M3 data the dollar pulled above 1.55 marks, giving a boost to export-oriented German stocks, in particular in the chemicals sector. Shares in chemicals groups Bayer AG and BASF AG were both firmly ahead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares in Germany's third largest bank Commerzbank were the most heavily traded during the day, ending up almost two percent or 75 pfennigs at 39.42 marks, earlier touching a new year-high of 39.65 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the good old takeover story,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The stock had also risen strongly on Tuesday on renewed banking sector merger talk, although dealers said there was no particular story boosting the stock and on Tuesday the bank said it had no comment on such rumours.</p>
<p>Business software group SAP AG was at the centre of attention after one of its founding members, Hans-Werner Hector, resigned from the supervisory board over differences with the company's chief executive.</p>
<p>The news had pressured the stock on Tuesday and on Wednesday SAP preference shares ended down 50 pfennigs at 206.50 marks. &quot;There are still some worries about SAP, but in general the market thinks it is better that Hector has gone, even if there has been a bit of mud-slinging,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>One of the day's biggest gainers were shares in pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe, encouraged by news that the company planned to pay a 1996 dividend of one mark per share plus a special payout of 30 pfennigs per share. Gehe shares closed up 2.70 marks at 96.95 marks.</p>
