<p>The recent rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yields reflects receding pessimism over the outlook for the economy in Japanese financial markets, a senior Bank of Japan (BOJ) official said on Friday.</p>
<p>The official told Reuters that in general long-term rate rises have a negative impact on the economy.</p>
<p>However, if it the recent rise was a sign that markets have turned more bullish towards the economy, it would be &quot;good news&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not know at which level long-term interest rates will stabilise because their movements have been too rapid,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, it seems the rise in the rates was a correction to the widespread pessimism earlier in the financial markets over the economic outlook in the short term and medium to long term,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The yield of the key 3.0 percent 182nd 10-year JGB closed at 2.585 percent on Friday, sharply up from Thursday's 2.510 percent close.</p>
<p>JGB yields have been on an uptrend recently because of growing expectations over a possible change in the BOJ's low interest rate policy following recent advances in Tokyo stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>The key 182nd JGB yield hit a record low for any benchmark 10-year bond of 2.075 percent on April 8.</p>
<p>The yield's fall to a record low followed the release of the BOJ's quarterly &quot;tankan&quot; corporate survey on April 2, which showed sentiment weakening in June.</p>
