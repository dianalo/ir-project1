<p>Yugoslavia is boosting its agriculture and aims to earn $1 billion from farm exports annually, a Serbia Socialist Party chief told an economic conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Our aim is to create modern production, to have a good domestic supply of quality food and to earn one billion dollars a year from agriculture exports,&quot; said Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) vice-president Dusan Matkovic, the Belgrade daily Politika reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;With some 400 million German marks ($215 million) invested in agriculture this year and the new privatisation law, conditions have been created for economic reform, especially in farming,&quot; he told the SPS economic reform council session.</p>
<p>Yugoslav agriculture, which helped the country endure four years of crippling U.N. sanctions, last year registered a negative growth rate of three to four percent.</p>
<p>Yugoslav Agriculture Minister Nedeljko Sipovac said this year's record wheat crop and expected good yields of other crops indicate that agricultural production would grow between five and six percent in 1997 over last year.</p>
<p>This year's wheat crop almost doubled to 3.123 million tonnes on a 25-year low of 1.51 million tonnes in 1996.</p>
<p>Sipovac said agriculture had great potential of creating substantial export revenue if used to full capacity.</p>
<p>The sector's exports this year are expected to reach $700 million.</p>
<p>Serbian agriculture minister Jovan Babovic said investments were made in wheat production, livestock development and more favourable purchase of agriculture machinery.</p>
<p>So far almost two million tonnes of wheat have been stored in silos and 75 million marks have been secured for payment of crop to farmers, Babovic said.</p>
<p>Some 54 million marks were granted for upgrading of livestock breeding and 100 million marks was earmarked for production of agriculture machinery.</p>
<p>In order to fully consolidate the sector, commercial banks should join with the federal government to reschedule agricultural debts, the Serbian minister said.</p>
<p>The sector's outstanding debt stood at some two billion dinars ($325 million) at the end of 1996. -- Beti Bilandzic, Belgrade newsroom 381 11 311 43 05 ($ = 1.865 German Marks)</p>
