<p>Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui on Friday apologised for a worsening crime problem highlighted by the kidnap and murder of a popular actress's daughter.</p>
<p>&quot;As head of state, I express my most sincere apology for the worsening social law and order,&quot; Lee's chief of staff, Huang Kun-huei, quoted the president as saying</p>
<p>&quot;The government will take full responsibility,&quot; Lee was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Lee made the apology during a security summit attended by top government officials and military leaders intended to calm public fears over crime on this affluent island of 21 million people.</p>
<p>The meeting was held ahead of a planned march by more than 20,000 people in Taipei on Sunday to protest what is perceived as the government's inability to stamp out crime.</p>
<p>In a crime that has shocked the nation, police on Monday found the body of 17-year-old Pai Hsiao-yen, daughter of actress Pai Ping-ping, floating naked in a river.</p>
<p>Police said the kidnappers, who remained at large, had bound and strangled the teenager and tossed her into the river with weights attached to her body.</p>
<p>The murder prompted calls for the resignation of Vice President Lien Chan, who doubles as premier, and other officials for failing to maintain social stability.</p>
<p>The island's police chief and other officals said they were willing to take responsibility for the situation but the president said the priority was on solving the case, Huang told a news conference at the meeting.</p>
<p>Pai's murder followed a string of high-profile violent crimes in recent months.</p>
<p>In November, two gunmen broke into the home of northern Taoyuan County magistrate Liu Pang-yu and killed eight people, including Liu, in gangland-style executions.</p>
<p>One week later, women's rights activist Peng Wan-ju was raped and stabbed to death in southern Taiwan. Police found 35 stab wounds in her naked body.</p>
<p>Both cases remain unsolved.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng acknowledged in December that Taiwan's social order had deteriorated to a shocking level, with the crime rate soaring by 80 percent from 1990 to 1996.</p>
<p>Anti-crime activists said the murder of Pai Hsiao-yen was the latest example of how the government failed to protect its people.</p>
<p>&quot;Pai's case was the last straw. And we can no longer tolerate the government's inability to stamp out crime,&quot; said Feng Hsien-hsien, executive director of the Peng Wan-ju Foundation, set up after the murder of the feminist.</p>
<p>&quot;This was why we decided to join forces to stage a large-scale march on Sunday to demand that the government improve law and order in Taiwan,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
