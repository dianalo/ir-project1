<title>USA: Arizona militia members change pleas to guilty.</title>
<headline>Arizona militia members change pleas to guilty.</headline>
<dateline>PHOENIX 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Five members of the self-styled paramilitary Viper Militia, accused initially by government officials of plotting to blow up federal buildings, changed their pleas to guilty on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Four members admitted to conspiracy and weapons charges in U.S. District Court in Phoenix as part of a plea agreement.</p>
<p>Finis Walker, 42, and David Belliveau, 28, each pleaded guilty to three felony counts during their court appearance. Ellen Belliveau, 27, faces two counts and Donna Williams, 44, one count for their role in the group.</p>
<p>A fifth member, Dean Pleasant, 28, chose not to be part of the deal with prosecutors, although he too changed his plea on three felony charges to guilty.</p>
<p>The pleas brought to 10 the number of militia members to decide against going to trial. All will receive time in prison when sentenced in March. A trial for the two remaining defendants was scheduled for Jan. 28.</p>
<p>Twelve militia members were arrested July 1, prompting President Clinton to praise the effort as averting &quot;a terrible terrorist attack.&quot;</p>
<p>Much of the government case surrounded tapes seized by authorities, including one that prosecutors initially claimed targeted federal buildings. Another tape showed camouflaged Viper members playing war games in the Arizona desert.</p>
<p>But the government later backed off some of its claims and admitted in court that there was no imminent threat posed by the Viper Militia.</p>
<p>Under the plea agreement, Walker faces 70 to 87 months in prison and David Belliveau between 57 and 71 months. Ellen Belliveau could receive 37 to 46 months behind bars and Williams 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Pleasant's charges carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.</p>
