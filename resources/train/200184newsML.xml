<title>FRANCE: French PM Juppe's poll approval rating at new low.</title>
<headline>French PM Juppe's poll approval rating at new low.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-11-19</dateline>

<p>Alain Juppe has become the most unpopular prime minister in modern France, according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday that showed him surpassing a record set by former Socialist premier Edith Cresson in 1992.</p>
<p>The BVA survey for the Paris Match weekly indicated that just 22 percent of voters had a good impression of Juppe's performance in office against 73 percent opposed.</p>
<p>The figures make him less popular even than Cresson, France's first woman prime minister, who was hounded from office in 1992 after only 10 months. Her worst score in a comparable BVA survey was 23 percent in favour with 67 percent opposed.</p>
<p>Cresson is now the European Union's Research Commissioner.</p>
<p>Blamed for record unemployment, a sluggish economy and the effects of austerity policies aimed at helping France qualify for a single European currency, Juppe's previous worst rating was a 24-70 percent split in October.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac, on a state visit to Tokyo, said on Tuesday that France had no alternative to its current economic and budgetary policies and he was prepared to accept the deep unpopularity they have caused. He ruled out a cabinet reshuffle.</p>
<p>BVA, which polled 968 people from November 14 to 16, found Chirac's rating unchanged from last month with 35 percent happy with his performance as president and 60 percent unhappy.</p>
<p>His worst rating was a 32-61 percent split a year ago during a wave of crippling strikes.</p>
<p>The poll also showed that the opposition Socialists, routed in the last legislative elections in 1993, had overtaken the ruling centre-right coalition among voters as the countdown begins to the next national vote in 1998.</p>
<p>Thirty-one percent said they would vote for a Socialist if an election were held next Sunday, up three points from October. Thirty percent said they would vote for a candidate from the ruling coalition, down from 33 percent last month.</p>
