<p>Thailand's human rights situation has improved since a 1992 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, but there are still extrajudicial killings and problems with refugees, Amnesty International said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Five years after the violent suppression of pro-democracy campaigners in Bangkok, the human rights situation is still cause for concern in Thailand,&quot; the London-based human rights organisation said in a report.</p>
<p>In May 1992 a series of mass demonstrations protesting the appointment of General Suchinda Kraprayoon as prime minister culminated in a violent crackdown by security officers in Bangkok. Amnesty said 52 people were killed and another 39 were missing following the demonstrations and are now persumed dead.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite improvements in some important areas since the May 1992 crackdown...Amnesty International is concerned at the level of extrajudicial killings committed by the security forces, the treatment and protection of refugees and the imposition of the death penalty for a wide variety of offences,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said although Thailand has taken many positive steps to strengthen human rights during the past five years, abuses continue.</p>
<p>&quot;These include an increasing number of extrajudicial executions of people suspected of criminal activities, the forcible return of Burmese refugees, and the continued detention of refugees and asylum seekers in poor conditions,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a widespread belief among the public that the police force operates with impunity, and people who investigate its abuses have been subject to intimidation and harassment,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Amnesty said since November 1996, when the current government of premier Chavalit Yongchaiyudh took office, there has been a marked increase in police shootings of criminal suspects. Some 29 people have reportedly been shot dead, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;In some cases, police have shot dead suspects after they had already surrendered, or when suspects have posed little or no threat to them,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>On refugees, Amnesty said some 4,000 had been forcibly returned to the Karen State in Burma since early 1997.</p>
<p>The Thai government denies it has forced any refugees to return to Burma. There are about 100,000 Burmese refugees living in sprawling camps along the Thai border. Most said they have fled fighting in their homeland.</p>
<p>Amnesty urged the Thai government to ensure that law enforcement officers use firearms as a last resort, and called on the government to promptly investigate all cases of extrajudicial killings.</p>
<p>&quot;It also urges the government to establish an effective national human rights commission, abolish the death penalty and ensure that refugees are properly protected and not sent back to face danger in their home countries,&quot; the report said.</p>
