<title>USA: Liposome gets French nod to market Abelcet.</title>
<headline>Liposome gets French nod to market Abelcet.</headline>

<p>Liposome Co said Monday it has received a go-ahead from French regulators to commercially sell Abelcet, its drug designed to treat systemic fungal infections.</p>
<p>The drug is the first lipid-based amphotericin B product to receive approval in France, said Charles A. Baker, chairman and chief executive officer of the U.S. company.</p>
<p>According to the company, Abelcet, a proprietary drug it developed, may be used to treat fungal infections such as candidiasis, aspergillosis and cryptococcal meningitis.</p>
<p>These infections most often attack patients with suppresed immune systems usually resulting from AIDS and therapies for cancer and bone marrow transplants, it said.</p>
<p>Amphotericin B, in its conventional form, was generally considered the drug of choice to combat those infections, until lipid-based produdcts were developed. Amphotericin B is the active ingredient of Abelcet, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said the approval it received will be for second-line treatment of patients with aspergillosis who have not responded to conventional antifungal therapy and first-line treatment in patients with aspergillosis whose renal function precludes the use of amphotericin B.</p>
<p>It said Abelcet has been approved for marketing in a variety of first and second line treatment in 15 countries and marketing applications have been filed in a number of other countries.</p>
