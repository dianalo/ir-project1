<p>H.J. Heinz Co chairman Tony O'Reilly said on Friday the U.S. food group was in deal talks with prospective buyers and would sell substantial businesses by April 30.</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of the fiscal year, the businesses will have a leaner focus,&quot; O'Reilly said in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>O'Reilly declined to identify the businesses on the auction block or estimate how much cash the properties would bring Heinz, a leading U.S. food products group which dominates several lines, such as canned tuna fish.</p>
<p>&quot;If I tell you, that's where the bargaining will start,&quot; O'Reilly said.</p>
<p>He said Heinz was in contact with four or five potential buyers.  </p>
<p>The executive said Heinz will trim down to six business clusters: food-service products, pet food, infant formula outside the United States, condiments such as ketchup, and weight-loss services and products.</p>
<p>A third to a fourth of Heinz businesses are estimated to be outside those areas.</p>
<p>&quot;The buzz word now is focus,&quot; O'Reilly said.</p>
<p>Heinz, based in Pittsburgh, has scheduled a Wall Street analysts' meeting in March on the asset sales.</p>
<p>O'Reilly repeated that Heinz should post a double-digit percentage profit increase in the fiscal year ending April 30.</p>
<p>The company 10 days ago repeated quarterly share profits of $0.47, up from $0.42 a year earlier, and said most businesses performed well.  An exception was U.S. Weight Watchers diet classes and foods.</p>
<p>Heinz shares were up 1/2 to 36-1/4.</p>
