<p>Russian newspapers on Friday painted a picture of a leaderless country adrift after the Kremlin announced that President Boris Yeltsin was in hospital with pneumonia.</p>
<p>&quot;President Sick, Premier On Holiday, Country All On Its Own,&quot; said a headline in the mainstream liberal Izvestia.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, was admitted to the elite Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow on Wednesday evening, less than two months after undergoing multiple heart bypass surgery.</p>
<p>He had returned to the Kremlin only two weeks earlier, promising active leadership after what doctors called a successful recovery from his operation.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the country's second in command under the constitution, was also on a previously scheduled holiday from Thursday.</p>
<p>Izvestia columnist Stepan Kiselyov portrayed Yeltsin as unable to lead, even after his return. &quot;What is going on? As I see it, the president's return after his long heart illness provided no leadership in the Kremlin.&quot;</p>
<p>The capital's most popular daily, Moskovsky Komsomolets, took a mocking tone about Yeltsin's latest bout of bad health.</p>
<p>&quot;They fooled us with Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin),&quot; their front-page article began. It then listed a series of promises the Kremlin had made about Yeltsin's imminent return to work which had gone unfulfilled.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is leading us?&quot; it asked, suggesting no one was at the helm.</p>
<p>The president's own newspaper, Rossiiskiye Vesti, attempted to show the president was actively working despite his illness.</p>
<p>A box on the front page printed four items related to Yeltsin, saying he checked into hospital, spoke at length by telephone with Chernomyrdin, signed several laws, and made an appeal to the Japanese prime minister.</p>
<p>Most television channels are either run by the government or more loyal to the Kremlin than newspapers, and television news coverage of Yeltsin's pneumonia was more restrained than most newspapers.</p>
<p>Muscovites interviewed on Friday also appeared calmer about the latest news about Yeltsin, generally agreeing that his pneumonia was a relatively common winter illness unrelated to his heart operation.</p>
<p>But newspapers cast a far more sceptical look at statements that Yeltsin would be back at work within a week.</p>
<p>&quot;Boris Yeltsin is again in hospital. Again, doctors are maintaining that everything will be in order within a week,&quot; was the main headline in Friday's edition of the liberal opposition newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta.</p>
<p>Editor Vitaly Tretyakov complained that officials were unable to lead without a healthy president.</p>
<p>&quot;The country is much sicker than the president,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It's completely clear that if the situation does not change for the better in the near future, then an already weakened Russia will suffer additional setbacks in domestic, and especially, foreign policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Several Russian newspapers ignored the Yeltsin health story altogether or devoted just a few lines to the story. Rabochaya Tribuna, for example, led with a story on Irish meat imports to Russia.</p>
