<p>President Boris Yeltsin said in his annual state of the nation address on Thursday that Russia faced a &quot;heavy burden of problems&quot; and that ordinary people doubted the authorities' ability to tackle crime.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia has entered the year of 1997 with a heavy burden of problems. The situation in the country is extremely difficult,&quot; he told parliament in a televised speech.  </p>
<p>Yeltsin, 66, making his first major policy statement since he began his second term as president last July and had heart surgery last November, spoke clearly and firmly.</p>
<p>The prime concern, he said, was the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise of prices has slowed down but we did not manage to stop the fall in (industrial) output and increase the flood of investments,&quot; Yeltsin said.</p>
<p>Touching on Russia's problem of growing crime, he said: &quot;Society is losing faith in the authorities' ability to fight crime.&quot;</p>
