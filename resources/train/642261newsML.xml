<p>The Dow industrials leapt to a record high on Friday after a monthly employment report reinforced investors' positive outlook on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The Dow surged 130 points to close unofficially at 7436. The gain, if official, would rank as the sixth largest in point terms in the blue-chip average's history, and shattered the Dow's previous closing high of 7383.41, set on May 27.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange Composite and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 indices also closed at record levels and the Nasdaq Composite ended just a few points shy of its all-time high.  </p>
<p>The session began on a nervous note, with bonds tumbling on the release of the employment data.</p>
<p>Investors were initially taken aback by a surprise dip in the unemployment rate to 4.8 percent. The rate was the lowest since October 1973 and raised fears of wage-driven inflation.</p>
<p>But other aspects of the report painted a more confusing picture, showing slower-than-expected job creation in May, a steep upward revision to April's new jobs figure and a moderate level of wage increases for May.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, analysts said the data showed the economy remains in an ideal mode for the stock market.  </p>
<p>&quot;The report basically said we are in an economy that is performing extremely well without any acceleration of inflation,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.</p>
<p>Bonds, which initially tumbled after release of the report, eventually changed course and staged a powerful rally of their own, driving the yield on the benchmark long bond down to 6.78 percent, its lowest since February 28.</p>
<p>Analysts said the bond market's gains were particularly encouraging and, if sustained, could lay the groundwork for an extended stock market rally.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it's pretty clear this is not a one-day wonder,&quot; said Peter Canelo, U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a solid case being made in the market that there's no inflation risk,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as bonds are settling down, this market is going higher.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that the strong growth-stable inflation picture appeared to attract renewed attention from investors abroad, particularly Europe, where questions mount daily about the political and economic outlook.  </p>
<p>&quot;The European monetary union looks like it's having trouble and there is fighting in Germany over their gold policy and uncertainty in France about the political situation,&quot; said Charles Pradilla, market analyst at Cowen and Co.</p>
<p>&quot;Here we are with a strong economy and no sign of inflation troubles,&quot; he said, &quot;so it's not surprising that our assets look attractive.&quot;</p>
<p>Financial stocks surged, boosted by the firm bond market. Dow components J.P. Morgan &amp; Co Inc added 2-3/4 to 111-1/2, American Express Co rose 2-3/8 to 71-3/4 and Travelers Group Inc rose 1-3/4 to 57-7/8.  </p>
<p>The favorable growth outlook implied by the strong economic picuture lifted tech stocks. Microsoft Corp climbed 3-1/2 to 124-1/16 and International Business Machines Corp gained 2-3/4 to 85-5/8.</p>
<p>Drug stocks also rallied, with Pfizer Inc up 4-1/8 to 107, Eli Lilly and Co up four to 97-1/8 and Warner-Lambert Co up four to 102.</p>
<p>First Brands Corp fell 3-3/8 to 22-5/8. The company warned its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates and said profits could remain under pressure through the next two quarters.  </p>
<p>Storage Dimensions Inc fell 3-15/16 to 6-5/16. Late Thursday, the company warned that its second-quarter results would be below expectations.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 14.58 points to 858.01, a record.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite gained 14.79 points to 1404.84.</p>
