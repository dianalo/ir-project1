<p>U.S. stock index futures ended strongly higher, buoyed by technical bullishness and spillover Treasury bond strength.</p>
<p>September Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures posted a fresh record high at 960.30, wiping out the old all-time peak set Friday at 951.75.</p>
<p>&quot;Stay long and you'll be OK in the end, just stay with it,&quot; an S&amp;P 500 futures trader said during the session. &quot;It just keeps rallying -- it's pretty technically bullish.&quot; He said the market's near-term uptrend remains healthy even if September pulls back to 951.00.  </p>
<p>Traders said the market could turn a bit edgy heading into significant data later this week, but until a surprise shakes things loose, the upward trend should continue, they said.</p>
<p>Any dips will likely attract buyers, they added.</p>
<p>Second-quarter gross-domestic product is due Thursday and July jobs data on Friday.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of economists showed an average estimated for GDP at 1.9 percent. July jobs were forecast up 193,000, versus a 217,000 June gain.</p>
<p>The jobless rate was seen at 4.9 percent, down from 5.0 in the previous report.  </p>
<p>Traders said action was only light to moderate in afternoon trade. They said a 1,000-lot offer in September S&amp;Ps at 957.50 stymied gains in the last 20 minutes of trade.</p>
<p>At the close, Sept S&amp;P 500s were up 10.15 pts to 957.15, Nikkei fell 190.0 pts to 20,300.0, Midcap 400s rose 4.85 to 315.85, Russell rose 4.40 to 417.00, and NASDAQ rose 13.25 to 1109.25.</p>
