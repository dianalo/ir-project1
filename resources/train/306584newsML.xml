<p>Michael Jack, financial secretary to the Treasury, said British industry was coping well with the strength of sterling.</p>
<p>&quot;Any company is bound to be concerned about factors which they would think would affect the pricing of their product, but they'd also be welcoming the fact that the strengthening of the pound has also reduced their raw material cost input,&quot; he said in an interview with BBC Radio.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that industry is coping well with the pressures and controlling their costs very adequately.&quot;  </p>
<p>British industry was right to be concerned about the pound but it had become more competitive and was dealing with cost pressures, Jack added.</p>
<p>Asked if the pound's strength might influence monetary policy, he said currency factors were only one of many which Chancellor Kenneth Clarke considered in setting interest rates.</p>
<p>Clarke had always made clear that he would do what was right to achieve his main objective, which was sustaining a low-inflation economy, Jack said.</p>
