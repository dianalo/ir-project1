<p>Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky said that a renewed investigation into R.J. Reynolds &quot;Joe Camel&quot; campaign may open the door to a broader investigation of tobacco advertising.</p>
<p>In an appearance on Court TV telecast over the weekend, Pitofsky said the FTC is investigating whether there is new evidence against the &quot;Joe Camel&quot; campaign, which critics assert attracts underage smokers.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the FTC is likely to investigate other tobacco campanies after it looks at the &quot;Joe Camel&quot; campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;We've always cast our eye at other companies' advertising,&quot; Pitofsky said. &quot;Our jurisdiction is to prevent advertising that's deceptive and unfair and that would be true of any product. This just happens to be one advertising campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>Pressed whether the FTC would look specifically at other tobacco company advertising so that it was not singling out R.J. Reynolds, Pitofsky said: &quot;We would probably take a look at that as well.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute said Monday that Pitofsky's comment was the first he had heard that there might be such a broadened investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not an area we've had an opportunity to think about and discuss,&quot; said Walker Merryman of the tobacco company trade association. Merryman said he had no knowledge that the FTC had contacted any other companies.</p>
<p>In 1994, before Pitofsky came on board, the FTC voted 3-2 not to take action against the &quot;Joe Camel&quot; campaign but left the door open to future action.</p>
<p>Recently the FTC staff recommended examining the issue again, contending there was new evidence showing the &quot;Joe Camel&quot; campaign affects children.</p>
<p>Pitofsky said he wanted to hear both sides before he made up his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't had a chance to have the Reynolds people in to give us their side of the story on what is claimed to be new evidence,&quot; he said. &quot;Their assertion is that there's no connection between the campaign and consumption and certainly no connection between the campaign and consumption by underage smokers,&quot; he said. &quot;And we'll just have to see what the facts are.&quot;</p>
