<p>Peru's anti-terrorist police warned two months before the Japanese ambassador's home was stormed that Marxist rebels planned to seize political and military figures as hostages, an intelligence report said.</p>
<p>The secret report, part of which was obtained by Reuters, said the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) had infiltrated heavily armed fighters into Peru's capital of Lima to form an elite squad to carry out high-profile operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Among the actions to be carried out would be the abduction of political and/or military personalities who would be used to pressure the government into releasing Tupac Amaru terrorist criminals in prison,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The six-page report, passed on from the Huancayo regional office of the DINCOTE anti-terrorism police to intelligence officials in the capital in mid-October, said the guerrillas planned to strike on or around Nov. 30, 1996, the first anniversary of a bloody all-night shootout between police and the MRTA in Lima's La Molina district.</p>
<p>It recommended that authorities in Lima step up efforts to ferret out MRTA rebels and sharply tighten security. But police sources said no action was taken.</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, a band of MRTA rebels burst in on a cocktail party at the Japanese envoy's residence and seized hundreds of VIP guests. The 72 men still held include President Alberto Fujimori's brother Pedro, two Peruvian government ministers, high-ranking military and police officers, the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors and about two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats.</p>
<p>Face-to-face talks between the government and the MRTA resumed last Tuesday after weeks of deadlock over the rebels' main demand -- freedom for 400 jailed comrades in exchange for the hostages' lives.</p>
<p>The report, and classified police documents drafted after the attack, indicate that the 17 rebels now holed up in the mansion come from Peru's central jungle, about 150 miles (240 kms) east of Lima.</p>
<p>Police said about 120 MRTA rebels operate near the towns of La Merced, Oxapampa and Chanchamayo, financing their operations through &quot;war taxes&quot; levied on coffee growers in the region. But the siege at the Japanese envoy's residence was financed by a kidnapping in Bolivia, they said.</p>
<p>Nearly 17 years of violence by the Cuban-inspired MRTA and its larger Maoist rival, Shining Path, has cost Peru 30,000 lives and about $25 billion in damage to the economy.</p>
