<title>UK: Granada sees more hotel sales shortly.</title>
<headline>Granada sees more hotel sales shortly.</headline>

<p>Granada chairman Gerry Robinson said on Wednesday he expected the company to make further progress on its hotel disposal programme in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;My bet would be that over the next three or four weeks we will see a number of announcements,&quot; Robinson told reporters after Granada's Annual General Meeting.</p>
<p>Robinson said there was buying interest in London's Grosvenor House, the largest of the 17 luxury &quot;Exclusive&quot; hotels Granada is in the process of selling. But he said the sale of the Grosvenor House, valued at in excess of 300 million pounds, would only go ahead if the right price were offered.</p>
<p>Robinson and chief executive Charles Allen said around 20-25 million pounds would pay for a complete upgrading of the building including its roof.</p>
<p>Granada has disposed of hotels in London, Paris and Barbados as it sells off some of the so-called &quot;trophy&quot; properties it acquired as part of last year's takeover of Forte.</p>
<p>Robinson said it was wrong to say that Granada had set itself a deadline of the end of this month to complete the sales. He said an end-March deadline would be &quot;sensible&quot;.</p>
<p>Allen said the $10.5 billion bid in the U.S by Hilton Hotels Corp for Sheraton owner ITT Corp had helped to highlight the value of hotel assets. Granada plans to begin to work on the disposal of its holding in Savoy Hotel Plc only when it has sold the Exclusive hotels.</p>
<p>Granada acquired a 68 percent stake in Savoy as part of the Forte deal. However, under the Savoy's complex ownership structure the shares only account for 42 percent of the voting rights in the company.</p>
