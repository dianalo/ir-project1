<p>China's top leader Jiang Zemin has issued an internal directive to the People's Liberation Army urging action on a crime wave among among its three million troops, Chinese sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Military officers were called into hastily arranged meetings in the past few days to listen to readings of the directive from Jiang, who holds China's top three jobs as Communist Party chief, state president and head of the army, the sources said.</p>
<p>Jiang issued the unusual internal directive, focusing on six key points that needed to be addressed by the army, in his capacity as chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, said the sources, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very unusual for Jiang Zemin himself to issue such a document,&quot; said one Chinese source. &quot;Such directives usually come from actual ranking generals.&quot;</p>
<p>The edict says an &quot;extremely complicated&quot; situation exists within the military and describes a wave of crime, including rape, murder, robbery and corruption, the sources said.</p>
<p>Among the more serious crimes mentioned in the directive was a major fraud case involving a large military-run hostel near the railway station in the heart of Beijing, the sources quoted the edict as saying.</p>
<p>The fraud implicated officers at a very senior level, they quoted the document as saying.</p>
<p>The document marked the first time Jiang has openly tried to assert his authority over the army since the death of his patron, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, last February.</p>
<p>Other cases involved robbery and theft, including a burglary at the Russian embassy by guards of the paramilitary People's Armed Police (PAP), which is responsible for protecting embassies, diplomatic compounds and key state and party buildings and officials.</p>
<p>The top leaders of the PAP were purged last year after a teenage paramilitary guard assigned to the home of a deputy chairman of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, murdered the elderly parliamentarian during a bungled burglary.</p>
<p>In a sign of the importance of the document, the PLA was ordered to cancel leave over the weekend and told to gather at their units to study the directive, the sources said.</p>
<p>China's ruling Communist Party, which holds sway over the military, uses the method of calling members and officials to meetings to hear internal documents to transmit its internal messages down through chosen sections of the party ranks.</p>
<p>They are then required to discuss and voice compliance with the document to prove their loyalty and agreement.</p>
<p>China rarely reveals disciplinary problems within its military ranks and the People's Liberation Army maintains a tight veil of secrecy. Even its telephone numbers are not available to the public.</p>
<p>Jiang has been eager to assert his authority over the army since the death of Deng, who made sure that his post at the top of powerful military was the last he relinquished before formally retiring in 1990.</p>
<p>However, Jiang lacks Deng's stature and tight grip over the military and never served in the army, a qualification regarded as essential in China by the late Chairman Mao Zedong who said &quot;power grows out of the barrel of the gun&quot;.</p>
