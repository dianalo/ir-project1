<p>The United States on Friday strongly condemned a spate of attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka and called on the rebels to stop their interference with foreign ships.</p>
<p>&quot;We urge the LTTE to cease all acts of terrorism. We join with Amnesty International in calling for the LTTE to stop immediately the killing of non-combatants and cease other human rights abuses,&quot; said James Foley, a deputy spokesman at the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>The United States was particularly concerned by rebel attacks on foreign vessels in Sri Lankan waters.</p>
<p>Foley said in a statement the LTTE had attacked an Indonesian-flag passenger ferry on July 1 and seized a North Korean cargo vessel and its crew on July 7. One North Korean crew member was killed in the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States strongly condemns the assassinations and the interference with shipping,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Foley said two parliamentarians from the Trincomalee area in Sri Lanka's eastern province were assassinated this month. Nine other civilians died in the attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;No group has claimed responsibility for these assassinations but we understand Sri Lankan officials view the LTTE as the primary suspect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States supported a negotiated political settlement in Sri Lanka and believed that the Sri Lankan government's proposal for constitutional reform provided a solid basis for the peaceful resolution of the violence.</p>
<p>In Colombo, Sri Lankan naval officials said on Friday the navy had fought a major battle with LTTE rebel boats off the island's east coast late on Thursday.</p>
<p>The officials said about 25 rebel boats were sailing to LTTE-held Mullaitivu on Sri Lanka's northeastern coast when the navy attacked them and damaged several rebel boats.</p>
<p>He said it was not clear how many rebels had been killed.</p>
<p>The LTTE are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankan government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war, now in its 15th year. The LTTE say the toll is higher.</p>
