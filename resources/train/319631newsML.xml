<title>FRANCE: French opposition parties back Cr Foncier staff.</title>

<p>France's opposition Socialist Party said on Monday it backed staff fighting government plans to shut down Credit Foncier de France and the Communists said the wind-down plan should be withdrawn.</p>
<p>&quot;The government and Finance Minister Jean Arthuis have been trying to break Credit Foncier,&quot; said a statement issued by the Socialist group in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;They are attacking an establishment which is producing a profit of one billion francs despite everything thrown in its path.</p>
<p>&quot;In the conflict with Mr Arthuis and the government, the Socialist group reaffirms its support and solidarity with a staff whose determination and seriousness demands respect.&quot;</p>
<p>Foncier staff occupied the beleaguered home loans group's Paris headquarters for a fourth day on Monday, preventing chairman Jerome Meyssonnier from leaving.</p>
<p>Communist group chairman Alain Bocquet said in a statement:</p>
<p>&quot;The government should urgently commit itself to genuine negotiations, which means, as staff are demanding, withdrawal of the Arthuis plan and the search for real alternatives which would allow Credit Foncier to carry on&quot;.</p>
<p>The Communists would question the government on the matter on Tuesday, said the statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the moderate Christian CFTC trade union said in a statement it welcomed Prime Minister Alain Juppe's decision to appoint a go-between, former SNCF state railways boss Philippe Rouvillois, in the dispute, with a mandate to start mediating as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The government wants to spin off part of the business to a cooperative group called Credit Immobilier and wind down the rest after losses of 10.8 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>But it has come up against stiff staff resistance, which has won some political backing across the spectrum in parliament and Credit Foncier boss Meyssonnier has himself predicted a profit this year of a billion francs.</p>
<p>Credit Foncier financial officer Olivier Hassler told FT Television on Monday he expected the group to repeat that profit for two or three years to come and said the company could work normally with the help of a capital injection of two or three billion francs.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what we're forecasting now for the two or three coming years,&quot; he said, according to a copy of the interview supplied to Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case capital will be partially rebuilt without too much help from outside. So the common evaluation is that with two or three billion francs capital injected, ... that would be enough to enable the company to work normally,&quot; he said.</p>
