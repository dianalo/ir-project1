<p>White House economic adviser Joseph Stiglitz declined Tuesday to discuss what action the Federal Reserve should take on interest rates, but said there was no indication that the strong economy and the low unemployment rate had sparked any inflationary pressures. Speaking to reporters at a briefing sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Stiglitz also said he expected the U.S. economy to continue to expand in the period ahead.  </p>
<p>Stiglitz took issue with an OECD report on the U.S. economy that suggested that it might be a good idea for the Federal Reserve to keep a tight reign on macroeconomic policy, perhaps even notching up interest rates to offset any inflationary pressures. While going to pains to not discuss Fed activity, Stiglitz took the view that the natural rate of unemployment has fallen substantially and that the risk of a new round of inflation was not existent.</p>
<p>The OECD economist, Peter Jarrett, told reporters at the briefing that there was an &quot;asymmetrical inflationary risk&quot; but Stiglitz said he did not agree with this.</p>
<p>The discussion came just one day before the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meets to discuss the future course of interest rates.</p>
<p>In discussing the overall vitality of the economy, Stiglitz also said that the consumer's financial situation was excellent and he expected strong consumption growth in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;In sum, U.S. economic performance remains strong, what should be up is up and what should be down is down. Employment is up, inflation is down, investment is up, interest rates are down,&quot; Stiglitz told the briefing.</p>
