<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin meets top security officials on Thursday to tackle conflict inside the Kremlin, after a senior minister accused President Boris Yeltsin's aide of planning to seize power.</p>
<p>The power struggle spilled onto the public stage on Wednesday when Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov accused Yeltsin's security chief Alexander Lebed of plotting a &quot;creeping coup&quot; while Yeltsin awaits heart surgery.</p>
<p>Lebed denied the accusations, made at a news conference, and said he would sue Kulikov.</p>
<p>Kulikov, Lebed's bitter political foe, said he had ordered unspecified extra security measures across Russia but made clear they were not directly linked to his charges. Moscow police said late on Wednesday they had received no orders to boost security.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press office said the president was worried by Kulikov's statement and had asked Chernomyrdin to give full details of the charges.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said Kulikov, Defence Minister Igor Rodionov, counter-intelligence head Nikolai Kovalyev, foreign intelligence chief Vyacheslav Trubnikov and Yeltsin's chief of staff Anatoly Chubais would attend the meeting early on Thursday.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether Lebed, secretary of Yeltsin's policy-making Security Council, was invited.</p>
<p>Kulikov told a news conference on Wednesday that Lebed, who joined Yeltsin's team after coming a solid third in the first round of presidential elections in June, was planning to seize the top Kremlin post without facing elections.</p>
<p>&quot;(Lebed) has decided to move ahead using force instead of waiting for the next presidential poll,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also said Chechen separatists with whom Lebed struck a controversial peace deal had promised to send 1,500 fighters to back the former paratroop general's power bid. A Chechen rebel spokesman later denied the accusation.</p>
<p>Kulikov, who insists that Lebed's peace deal in Chechnya encouraged terrorism rather than brought an end to the 21-month Chechen war, later said his new tight security measures were ordered after he received intelligence reports about planned attacks by rebels from Chechnya. He gave no details.</p>
<p>Lebed laughed off the minister's accusations.</p>
<p>&quot;There cannot even be talk of an attempted coup d'etat,&quot; Lebed told a hastily-called news conference. &quot;Nothing will happen...unless Kulikov stirs things up.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed said he was sure his rival would be fired over the incident.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's announcement on September 5 that he would undergo a heart operation fuelled the power struggle in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>The president, whose operation is scheduled for mid-November, moved slowly and his eyes were puffy in brief television footage of his meeting with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin dropped out of public view shortly before he was reelected on July 3. He suffered two heart attacks last year and one surgeon says he may have had a third this summer.</p>
<p>Yeltsin had delegated some of his powers to Chernomyrdin. But Lebed, Chubais and some other top officials have moved to secure their share of power.</p>
<p>Kulikov said Lebed was planning to set up a 50,000-strong Russian legion which would report directly to him.</p>
<p>The drama overshadowed a visit to Moscow by U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry, intended to persuade parliament to ratify the START-2 treaty which would slash the number of strategic nuclear warheads to a third of Cold War levels.</p>
<p>Rodionov said after talks with Perry that he hoped parliament would ratify the treaty.</p>
