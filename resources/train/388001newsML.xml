<headline>Jakarta shares end slightly lower on profit taking.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-02-19</dateline>

<p>Profit-taking in several blue chips pushed the Jakarta shares index lower on Wednesday despite active buying of many secondaries, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index close 0.33 points lower, or 0.05 percent, to close at 694.88 points after touching an intra-day high of 697.67 points earlier. Gainers led losers by 64 to 58, with 55 counters unchanged. Turnover was 507.30 billion rupiah on a volume of 213.03 million shares.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was likely to be mixed on Thursday with local-led investors possibly continuing to snap up several medium and small stocks.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today's sentiment was mixed. Buying interest in some secondaries was strong while several blue chips remained under selling pressure from profit-takers,&quot; a foreign broker said.</p>
<p>Profit-taker were targeting blue-chips such as cigarette maker Sampoerna, telecommunications firm Indosat, cement maker Semen Gresik and noodle maker Indofood, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is mostly a technical correction after the prices moved up quite fast last week,&quot; a broker with leading foreign bank said.</p>
<p>Heavyweight telecommunications service provider PT Indosat fell 100 rupiah to 7,000 rupiah on a volume of 1.3 million shares.  </p>
<p>Bank Negara Indonesia was the most active stock, rising 50 rupiah to 1,725 rupiah after on a high of 1,750 rupiah on a volume of 24.1 million shares after some investors bought back shares after the recent correction.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a favourite stock. The recent correction had invited some investors to buy it back,&quot; a local broker said.</p>
<p>Engineering firm Bukaka Teknik Utama was also actively traded after a newspaper report which quoted the company's president director as saying it had won a number of World Bank infastructure projects in East Asia. The bank's Indonesian office later denied the report.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a bit mistaken. The World Bank does not give anybody projects. We lend money to the governments and the governments select the firms that undertake the projects. We do not select the firms,&quot; Dennis de Tray, director of the World Bank's resident staff in Indonesia, told Reuters.</p>
<p>State-controlled tin miner Tambang Timah also remained under selling pressure after the government announced on Tuesday that state companies will only be involved in the Busang gold project when it enters the production stage.</p>
<p>It was off 300 rupiah to 4,125 rupiah on a turnover of 3.8 million shares.  </p>
<p>Shares of Astra International, which just approved its new board of commissioners was stable at a price of 6,350 rupiah on a volume of 375,000 shares.</p>
<p>Astra's shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting approved a new nine-member board of commissioners with tycoon Muhammad &quot;Bob&quot; Hasan as a president.</p>
<p>There were no changes in the Astra's board of directors.</p>
