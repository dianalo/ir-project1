<p>Romania's reform programme is on track but the Balkan country needs to push further with steps to reshape its economy and confirm foreign investors' confidence, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They've been doing good so far. They need now to go further with privatisation and portfolio investments law,&quot; SBC Warburg emerging market director David Mars told Reuters.</p>
<p>The new centrist-coalition government, which ousted leftists in 1996 elections, launched radical reforms with tough monetary policy, cautious budget spending and liberalisation of prices and foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p>Under the IMF-backed shock-therapy reform programme Bucharest also pledged to speed up privatisation and restructuring and adopt laws to gain foreign investors.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said measures taken so far proved his cabinet commitment to radical reforms, for which he would seek parliamentary support next week.</p>
<p>The government has been so far spared of major labour unrest but faces opposition claims over failure to improve living standards for Romanians, whose net average wage fell by about 30 percent to $70 in the past year.</p>
<p>Monthly inflation hit a record 30.7 percent in March following fuel, energy and food price freeing. It slid to 6.9 percent last month and is estimated to slow down to about two percent in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;They achieved a basic (macro-economic) stabilisation but this doesn't necessarily resume growth. The big issue is restructuring,&quot; Mars said.</p>
<p>Attractive yields on short-term government paper and growing interest in Romanian equities brought significant dollar inflows on the market, prompting central bank moves to soak up the excess and prevent a firmer leu currency.</p>
<p>&quot;People have already put money in Romania reflecting that they believe the government programme,&quot; said ING Barings economist Parvoleta Shtereva.</p>
<p>Foreign inflows, boosted also by last month's approval of $430 million in International Monetary Fund credits for Romania, allowed the central bank to build on reserves, now at $1.6 billion or double February's level.</p>
<p>Analysts said the time was ripe now for restructuring moves given the relative stability of prices, exchange rate and trade balance during the summer months.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the time to do painful reforms and they shouldn't miss that opportunity...We have to see quick disposal of loss-making companies,&quot; Shtereva said.</p>
<p>After seven years of sluggish market reforms the bulk of Romanian companies are still controlled by the state.</p>
<p>Last month the new government earmarked tens of communist-era companies for restructuring but analysts say Bucharest now needed to demonstrate the commitment to close down the loss-makers in order to boost confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;With price liberalisation they are living now in the real world,&quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Kenningham.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately (foreign) investors need to see layoffs and enterprise restructuring and the government has to show it has the guts to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Romania gained only little over $2.3 billion in foreign direct investments since the 1989 fall of communism. This is only a tenth of the level attracted by its neighbouring Hungary.</p>
<p>Analysts also said the government should exploit the fact that people were still ready to accept the reform bill and implement much-needed tough structural measures.</p>
<p>&quot;They should use the honeymoon period,&quot; Kenningham said.</p>
