<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin working on papers, no meetings - Kremlin.</title>
<headline>Yeltsin working on papers, no meetings - Kremlin.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-01-27</dateline>

<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin was working on papers but had no official meetings scheduled for Monday at the state residence where he is convalescing from pneumonia, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>&quot;The president is working on documents,&quot; a spokesman for the presidential press service said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said he had no new details about the 65-year-old president's state of health, one week after he left hospital following 12 days of treatment for pneumonia.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, recovering at the Gorky-9 residence outside Moscow, was expected to have several meetings this week but none was scheduled for Monday, said the spokesman.</p>
<p>Russian television has shown no new footage of Yeltsin for three weeks, a longer gap even than the 15 days between the heart surgery he underwent on November 5 and his first television appearance after the operation.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's political opponents have called for his removal for health reasons, but the Kremlin has dismissed the demands.</p>
<p>Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said on Friday Yeltsin had not yet completed his recovery from pneumonia but was keen to return to full work and did not intend to scrap several planned foreign trips.</p>
<p>Yeltsin is due to meet Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, whose country holds the European Union's rotating presidency, in the Hague on February 4. He is also due to host a visit by French President Jacques Chirac on Sunday.</p>
<p>Doctors have said Yeltsin's latest health problems are not related to last November's heart bypass operation. His heart problems kept him out of the Kremlin for most of the second half of last year.</p>
