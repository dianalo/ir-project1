<p>Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi has scrapped a capital gains tax imposed on insurance companies' holdings of Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)-listed shares, a move industry officials saw as very progressive.</p>
<p>In his budget presentation to parliament on Thursday, Mudavadi said he removed the 35-percent tax to help capital markets grow and boost Kenya's status as an emerging market.</p>
<p>He also reduced stamp duty on primary issues by 60 percent on the NSE, but did not say what the new rate was.</p>
<p>Insurance companies and NSE executives said Mudavadi's measures were tailored to improve liquidity in the market and help create a more vibrant bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very welcome development, which should be able to stir up insurance companies to trade actively in our market,&quot; said NSE chief executive Job Kihumba.</p>
<p>NSE capitalisation stands at $2.28 billion. About 20 to 25 percent is illiquid stock held by insurance companies who for a long time have adopted a buy-and-hold policy, officials said.</p>
<p>Ashok Shah, managing diretor at Apollo Insurance, said &quot;we can now start trading (on the bourse). For a long time, the insurance industry was the only industry taxed for the profits made on investment.&quot;</p>
<p>The capital gains tax imposed on exchange-listed stocks was seen as punitive since individuals were not taxed on investment gains made at the NSE.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of interest in Kenya as an emerging market from foreigners, but a major problem we have had is the unavailability of stocks,&quot; a senior broker said.</p>
<p>But NSE chairman Jimnah Mbaru said reduction of stamp duty would cut the cost of raising capital on the bourse.</p>
