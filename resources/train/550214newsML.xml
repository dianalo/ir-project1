<title>BRAZIL: Brazil coffee differentials shy away from New York.</title>
<headline>Brazil coffee differentials shy away from New York.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-04-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazilian coffee traders were scratching their heads over widening differentials at a time of rising New York prices but even so buyers were showing little interest, they said.</p>
<p>Brazil 2/3 17/18s were today quoted in the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Center Bulletin at a 10/11 point discount as opposed to a seven/eight point differential at the start of the week. At the beginning of the month the discount was 1.50 to five cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Brazilian differentials are if anything falling back while prices are moving higher and higher. Moreover buyers are holding back as if they are looking for even larger differentials,&quot; dealers said.</p>
<p>Traders were likewise at a loss to find any fresh fundamental news for the recent rally which saw many contracts in New York hitting new highs today.</p>
<p>&quot;All we can see is that there is a squeeze on fine coffees,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers cited prices of up to $500 per 50-kg bag at the most recent Kenyan auction which effectively meant premiums of up to $300 over New York as opposed to more normal premiums of $100, they said.</p>
<p>The May/July switch was also hitting interest and together with a Brazilian public holiday for May Day which many were extending through Friday, this week was seen as very uneventful.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the first week in May however, a series of meetings were scheduled.</p>
<p>On May 7 the second official meeting of Brazil's coffee council, the CDPC, was due to examine a report on restructuring producer debt.</p>
<p>In preparation for this meeting, council members, minus the council's minister Industry and Commerce Minister Francisco Dornelles, are scheduled to meet in Belo Horizonte on May 6.</p>
<p>Then on May 8, a six-member commission from Brazil's two exporter entities are to hold the first set of talks on whether they can form a new, united organisation following a split which took place in November 1995.</p>
