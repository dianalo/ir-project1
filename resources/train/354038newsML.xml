<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan concedes, accepts U.S. investment pact.</title>
<headline>Taiwan concedes, accepts U.S. investment pact.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI, Taiwan</dateline>

<p>Taiwan acceded to U.S. pressure Tuesday and agreed in principle to sign a broad investment pact with the United States in exchange for Washington's commitment to help it join two international groups, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have tentatively committed to sign the agreement following our discussions with the United States,&quot; said a spokesman for the Board of Foreign Trade, a cabinet agency.</p>
<p>&quot;The pact could be helpful in attracting more American investment here,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;But because the agreement involves too many issues, we need further discussion with the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>Lin Yi-fu, the board's director-general and Taiwan's chief negotiator, told reporters Taipei would send officials to Washington in April for further talks on the investment issue.</p>
<p>Under the bilateral pact, Taiwan would be obliged to open its service market widely, granting almost unrestricted access to banking and other financial services, Taiwan trade officials said.</p>
<p>The board said the U.S. side committed to help Taiwan join two international organisations, the U.S.-Japan Semi-Conductor Association and the Global Government Forum.</p>
<p>The trade officials said the terms of the investment pact were more liberal than those for entry to the World Trade Organisation -- a goal that still eludes Taiwan despite its global trading prowess.</p>
<p>Taiwan's WTO entry bid faces a formidable political obstacle because longtime rival China has said Taiwan should not be allowed membership before the communist mainland itself.</p>
<p>Taiwan officials said Tuesday an internal evaluation convinced them they had no bargaining power to resist signing the U.S. pact.</p>
<p>The Board of Foreign Trade officially welcomed the pact. &quot;The agreement will be helpful in increasing bilateral ties,&quot; the board said in a statement. &quot;It will also attract American businesses to invest in Taiwan.&quot;</p>
<p>The investment talks were held on the sidelines of U.S.-Taiwan negotiations on the island's bid to enter the World Trade Organisation. Those talks ended on Monday.</p>
<p>Taiwan has completed talks with 16 of the 26 WTO members that have requested such dialogues with the island. It will return to its WTO talks with the United States in Washington in early March, officials said.</p>
