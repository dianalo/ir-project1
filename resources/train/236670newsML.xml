<p>A small group of strong Russian firms hungry for credit and led by utility Mosenergo are set to sweep into the Eurobond market, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia is very hot on the external debt side right now and I do not anticipate that that will cool off in the first or second quarter next year,&quot; said Dirk Damrau, head of research at Moscow's Renaissance Capital investment bank.</p>
<p>The cream of the Russian corporates, after years in exile from capital markets, offer fairly steady cashflow and relatively low debt -- even better than some far-flung municipalities readying Eurobonds, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very bizarre situation -- in Russia some company risk may be perceived less than country risk,&quot; said James Fenkner, head of research at CentreInvest Securities.</p>
<p>Mosenergo, the bellwether of the Russian equities market and the first Russian issuer of an American Depositary Receipt (ADR), announced on Thursday it would issue a $100-$150 million Eurobond with five-year maturity in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers would lead the issue, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The positive reaction to the Russian Euro sets the stage for a positive reception for Mosenergo,&quot; said Peter Halloran, head of equities for CS First Boston in Moscow.</p>
<p>Analysts said a small group of leading firms face a warm reception by investors, who oversubscribed Russia's debut, $1 billion post-Communist Eurobond in November by a factor of two.</p>
<p>Mosenergo's schedule would make it the first Russian corporate Eurobond, though a few leading corporations may follow, just as they did with ADR issues, which put a number of Russian equities into the hands of foreign investors this year.</p>
<p>Fenkner said neither the Russian government, eager for taxes from healthy companies, nor foreign investors with only one Russian Eurobond to choose from, were likely to discourage a small flood of issues.</p>
<p>National utility gridholder Unified Energy System (UES) and Moscow City Telephone (MGTS) have both said they may issue Eurobonds, in the second half and second quarter of 1997 respectively, and oil company LUKoil said it would issue a bond, though not in the near future.</p>
<p>Natural gas monopoly Gazprom is considering a Eurobond, and analysts said long-distance telephone company Rostelekom would probably be successful if it decided to launch.</p>
<p>Caught by high interest rates at home, even top Russian firms are desperate to borrow at world rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporate lending by Russian banks has been almost non-existent,&quot; said Halloran.</p>
<p>Damrau, who estimated that Russian oil companies were 10 percent as leveraged as their Western counterparts, said top corporate issuers could get rates better than some cities.</p>
<p>&quot;Proving a revenue stream even in the case of St Petersburg or Moscow in this transition environment is going to be difficult,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Moscow plans to offer a $500 million bond by February and St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and the Urals region of Sverdlovsk are also planning issues.</p>
<p>Corporate Eurobond issuers should also see their stock price improve given the access to capital that most firms in Russia can only dream of, said Fenkner.</p>
<p>&quot;The key in Russia is which companies can get close to financing. Any company which can free itself from high interest is going to perform fantastically in equities.&quot;</p>
