<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine bonds rise after jobless report.</title>
<headline>Argentine bonds rise after jobless report.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-02-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine bonds were higher late Friday, tracking U.S. Treasuries up after a well received January U.S. jobless report.</p>
<p>A trader said activity was light throughout the session but as some players were short going into the jobless report, there were sufficient buyers to lift prices higher.</p>
<p>Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 rose 1/4 to 90-1/2, while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.10 to 125.95.  </p>
<p>Another trader said: &quot;Here I am waiting for the correction that is not coming.&quot;</p>
<p>Many market players have been predicting a correction this week considering the sharp rally in January and the current tight spread to U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Many still expect the market to correct, particularly considering the slim volumes in recent sessions evidencing caution by many investors. But, the second trader said: &quot;I think we have to wait a couple of sessions before the market's trend becomes clearer.&quot;</p>
<p>Call money rates were unchanged at 6.0 percent.</p>
