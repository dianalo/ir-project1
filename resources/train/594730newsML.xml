<p>Veteran South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung was elected by a landslide on Monday as his party's candidate to run in presidential polls against a ruling camp battered by a sleaze scandal.</p>
<p>Amid scenes of jubilation, the National Congress for New Politics gave a ringing endorsement to the firebrand politician, who will be making a record fourth bid for the presidency.</p>
<p>However, political analysts gave Kim little chance of victory, even though the ruling New Korea Party has yet to select its own nominee for the December vote and is in disarray as it grapples with a graft scandal.</p>
<p>Despite his credentials as a warrior in the country's long battle for democracy against military-backed rule, some analysts said the 74-year-old Kim represented to many voters an old generation of politicians stained equally by corruption.</p>
<p>Young voters, in particular, wanted to change a political landscape dominated for years by Kim and his one-time dissident comrade Kim Young-sam, the current president, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;People see the two Kims as part of the corrupt establishment and they want something new,&quot; said Kim Byung-kook, a professor of political science at Korea University.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, delegates at a National Congress convention stuck firmly with Kim Dae0jung and gave him a standing ovation after the election results were announced. He received 3,224 votes against 907 for the one candidate opposing him, Chung Dai-chul.</p>
<p>&quot;I promise you television politics where all people can participate,&quot; Kim told wildly cheering delegates packed into a Seoul sports stadium, indicating his first efforts to update a tub-thumping image.</p>
<p>&quot;I promise to bring you exciting politics,&quot; he said to his supporters waving large pictures of Kim. Silver streamers showering the new candidate covered the stage.</p>
<p>In a veiled attack on President Kim, he also promised to spare his opponents if elected.</p>
<p>&quot;I, Kim Dae-jung, have experienced political revenge. So I promise never to take revenge,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;President (Nelson) Mandela has appointed a white vice-president, and he has not taken revenge on the white people. There is no reason I cannot accomplish what President Mandela has accomplished,&quot; he said, referring to the black South African president.</p>
<p>To underline his theme he was accompanied on stage by Mandela's daughter Zindzi. She later presented Kim with a watch used by Mandela during his time in prison and Kim handed her his 20-year-old leather briefcase to take back for Mandela, party officials said.</p>
<p>President Kim hounded his two predecessors, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae-woo, into jail last year on charges of corruption and other abuses while in office.</p>
<p>In his long and turbulent political career, Kim Dae-jung has survived a kidnapping, assassination attempts and a death sentence imposed under Chun's rule but later suspended.</p>
<p>A local hero in the southwestern city of Kwangju and the surrounding Cholla province, Kim was arrested on the eve of a 1980 civil revolt in the city against martial law imposed by then-general Chun.</p>
<p>His election as presidential nominee came a day after the first government-sponsored anniversary mourning for victims of an army massacre that crushed the rebellion.</p>
<p>The National Congress and the smaller United Liberal Democrats led by arch-conservative Kim Jong-pil have been discussing putting up a single candidate against the New Korea Party nominee. Analysts said the talks were unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>President Kim is constitutionally barred from seeking a second term, and the graft scandal has left him a lame duck for the remainder of his term.</p>
<p>New Korea Party presidential hopefuls are now jockeying for position.</p>
<p>President Kim's son, Kim Hyun-chul, was arrested on Saturday for corruption in the latest chapter of a loans-for-kickbacks scandal surrounding the failure in January of Hanbo Steel Co.</p>
<p>Prosecutors on Monday demanded long jail terms for a former cabinet minister, three of Kim Young-sam's most loyal ruling party allies and eight others standing trial in connection with the Hanbo affair.</p>
