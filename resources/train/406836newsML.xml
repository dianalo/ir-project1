<p>Continental European stock markets flirted with record levels on Thursday, largely ignoring warnings from U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, but London was much more cautious.</p>
<p>German and French stocks rose strongly in the morning despite Greenspan's warning against excessive optimism over the U.S. economy and his hints that the Fed might raise interest rates to nip any inflation in the bud.</p>
<p>A lower Wall Street opening pared some of the gains but the continental markets remained strong.</p>
<p>London dealers were more sober, saying that Europe could not ignore any rise in U.S. rates and the FTSE idex was up only marginally at mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>Germany led the way with the blue-chip DAX index closing floor trade up 1.2 percent or 38.85 points at a record 3,276.72, a fraction of a point higher than the previous high set on February 18.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 climbed to within a point of its record set earlier this month before slipping to finish up 1.05 percent or 27.23 points at 2,629.40.</p>
<p>On the continent domestic factors outweighed Greenspan. French investors were more interested in good data on the troubled domestic economy than Greenspan.</p>
<p>Data on Thursday showed French gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, giving full-year growth of 1.3 percent. &quot;After Greenspan's statements and the drop on Wall Street, we were bracing for a decline today. But the GDP is a positive surprise,&quot; a Paris broker said.</p>
<p>London was more cautious, with the market barely holding on to modest morning gains after a weak opening on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial average was down 18.08 points at 6.965.10 in early business.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't taken too much notice of Mr Greenspan ourselves but it doesn't mean we will ignore any change in the interest rate environment there,&quot; said a senior London trader.</p>
<p>The FTSE index was up just 3.0 points at 4,332.3.</p>
<p>Wall Street was down on U.S. January durable goods data which showed a 3.6 percent rise, more than twice the expected rate. This was the kind of signal of possible inflation that might persuade the Fed to raise rates.</p>
<p>Most dealers believe the Fed will have to raise rates sooner or later but London traders were remaining calm.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Wall Street will only correct when he puts rates up because there are real signs that the economy is growing too fast,&quot; said the head of British equities at one major fund management group.</p>
<p>British investors also had a domestic political factor in a parliamentary by-election on Thursday, in which the ruling Conservatives are expected to lose to the opposition Labour Party.</p>
<p>But traders mostly wanted a clear-cut Labour victory, which could be seen to reduce the chance of no party winning decisively in the general election which has to be held by May.</p>
<p>The dollar recouped some of its overnight losses against the yen and was stable against the mark. The U.S. data and the prospect of higher rates gave some support.</p>
<p>The dollar recovered a little from an early low of 120.36 yen to reach 120.78 at mid afternoon but remained well below its late Wednesday European level of 122.15.</p>
<p>It was also at 1.6872 marks, slightly lower than its level in late European trading on Wednesday, after a Dutch interest rate rise.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam, the Dutch central bank said it was raising its special advances rate to 2.70 percent from 2.50 for a seven-day money market pact it will launch at tender on Friday.</p>
<p>The dollar struggled to make headway against the yen as investors continued to speculate about repatriation of funds by Japanese corporations before the end of their fiscal year in March.</p>
<p>&quot;That's tending to drag the dollar down,&quot; said Glenn Davies, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais Laing here. &quot;But it seems to us as though the dollar should be strengthening against the mark.&quot;</p>
<p>Prices of rare precious metals platinum and palladium leapt on fears there could be strike at Russia's huge Norilsk production facility in Arctic Siberia.</p>
<p>Later they eased as speculators took profits but at the London fixing platinum was at $393.50 per ounce, up $10 and its highest fix since last September.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1600 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6872 marks and 120.78 yen, compared with 1.6895 and 122.15 in late European trade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1600 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was up 3.0 points at 4,332.3.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 closed 27.23 points higher at 2,629.40.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed up 38.85 points at a record 3,276.72. The IBIS index was up 26.15 at 3,271.17</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $360 an ounce in the afternoon after being fixed in the morning at $356.60 and compared with $353.85 at the London close on Wednesday. Silver was four cents higher at $5.27.</p>
