<p>Britain's industrial gas users saw their gas bills creep higher last year, but still enjoy cheaper gas than the rest of Western Europe and North America, a survey by U.K. consultants National Utility Services (NUS) revealed.</p>
<p>The 13-country survey showed a year-on-year increase in U.K. business user gas prices of more than five percent in 1996 to 0.6 pence per kilowatt hour (p/kwh), a sharp reversal from the 40 percent slide registered in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The honeymoon period that British industry has enjoyed with the injection of competition into the market is over,&quot; said NUS director Andrew Johns.</p>
<p>Prices shown in the survey were the average of independent suppliers and British Gas for contracts renewed on September 1, 1996.</p>
<p>A recovery in spot market prices, the tightening of margins by independent suppliers and the consumption of surplus North Sea gas combined to keep the heat under end-user prices, said the NUS report.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, British industry still pays less for gas than its competitors in Western Europe, where gas market deregulation is proceeding at a slower pace.</p>
<p>And Britain even enjoys lower prices than in the fully-competitive gas markets of the United States and Canada, the survey said.</p>
<p>Italy topped the table in 1996, with industrial customers paying an average of 2.31 p/kwh for gas, almost four times as much as British consumers.</p>
<p>Spanish gas prices averaged 1.58 p/kwh, while prices in the Netherlands, itself a large gas producer, were 1.47 p/kwh -- more than double U.K. prices.</p>
<p>In France, gas bills averaged 1.40 p/kwh, and 1.37 p/kwh in Germany. Belgium boasted the cheapest gas prices in continental Western Europe at 1.21 p/kwh.</p>
<p>Despite a leap of more than 14 percent last year, U.S. prices still averaged below 1 p/kwh at 0.88 p/kwh, while Canadian prices hovered slightly above U.K. prices at 0.68 p/kwh.</p>
