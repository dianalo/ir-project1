<p>Gaming machine maker AWA Ltd said on Monday it was looking to expand its business after reporting a A$15.69 million loss for the 1996/97 first half.</p>
<p>&quot;The reported loss was largely the cost of transition,&quot; managing director John Rouse said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we are now in a position to take advantage of opportunities to expand our core businesses, being debt free and with a strong balance sheet after the sale of all our underperforming businesses,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We will prudently manage the change process from downsizing to the pursuit of new business opportunities,&quot; Rouse said.  </p>
<p>AWA said it was actively looking at domestic and international expansion opportunities.</p>
<p>It said it had expressed an interest in being involved in the privatisation of the New South wales Totalisator Agency Board and at the appropriate time intended to submit a proposal which would demonstrate the benefits of AWA's involvement.</p>
<p>The company said it had been reviewing it options to participate in gaming machine market. It also said it had decided that its current business of marketing gaming machines based on third party technology will cease, although maintenance and full support for the machines sold to date would continue.  </p>
<p>&quot;AWA has also determined that it will not acquire an Australian gaming machine business at this time,&quot; AWA said.</p>
<p>It said the operating loss was due to the abnormal loss from the sale of its traffic, aerospace and rural communications businesses to Plessey Corp Ltd of South Africa.</p>
<p>AWA shares closed steady at 86 cents.</p>
