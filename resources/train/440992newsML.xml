<title>SWITZERLAND: CS doesn't exclude private bank purchase.</title>

<p>Credit Suisse's private banking division is not excluding an acquisition to expand its onshore activities outside of Switzerland, said Klaus Jenny, chief executive officer of CS's private banking division.</p>
<p>Jenny, speaking to journalists at a briefing held by the private banking operations, said of the bank: &quot;Our mission statement is to vigorously expand.&quot;</p>
<p>He said such expansion could be accomplished by growing existing operations abroad, or by acquiring teams who would bring assets with them.</p>
<p>A third variation would be to buy banks.</p>
<p>He said the third variant would be in some cases preferrable, if the opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a question of the opportunity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Far East is a fast-growing market for private banking.</p>
<p>Bankers also said Germany is becoming increasingly attractive for onshore business, in other words, the business of managing funds within the country where the investor is based, as opposed to offshore, where the funds are managed in a country other than where the investor lives.</p>
<p>German banks in the past were keen to enter the Swiss private banking market, but the strong growth expected in onshore banking was also making Germany an attractive place to expand business for Swiss private banks, one banker said.</p>
<p>Jenny said estimated total global private assets at $16.7 trillion in 1995, up from $9.2 trillion in 1985.</p>
<p>He said offshore banking accounted for 20 to 30 percent of this, and onshore banking for 70 to 80 percent.</p>
<p>He said that offshore banking tends to be more profitable than onshore. But onshore banking is growing more rapidly in volume terms.</p>
<p>Switzerland remains the leading centre for offshore funds, accounting for 40 percent of the estimated total world market of $3.2 trillion to $4.8 trillion. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340</p>
