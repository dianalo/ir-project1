<p>Shares in Britain's East Midlands Electricity Plc sparked higher on Thursday amid a fresh outbreak of bid speculation, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>The stock was up 20-1/2p at 519-1/2 bu 0835 GMT, continuing a rebound since it touched a 19-month low of 477p on October 17.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's just been a bit of speculation that there could be some action,&quot; said a market-maker at one brokerage, &quot;it always comes and goes.&quot;</p>
<p>Said another: &quot;We have seen a bit of interest, it seems to be seen as a takeover target.&quot;  </p>
<p>Chris Perry, analyst at Charterhouse Tilney, said he was not surprised to see a resurgence of takeover speculation in the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;At the time of its last results, the company effectively indicated its surprise that it hadn't been taken over, their shares had fallen back a long way and it's perhaps no surprise that bid rumours are re-emerging.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said interest in the electricity sector could revive ahead of the results season which kicks off with figures from Southern Electric Plc at the end of November.</p>
<p>&quot;There is going to be a big focus on the ability of these companies to hand out more cash... if the results season is not going to get it going, then nothing will.&quot;</p>
<p>Among other electricity stocks London Electricity Plc was up 7p at 573-1/2, Northern Electric Plc was up 5p at 495 and Yorkshire Electricity Plc was up 6p at 723-1/2.</p>
