<p>Hungary's central bank raised a deposit rate on Monday in a move that analysts said was designed to counter a further decline in interest rates and prevent capital flowing out of the country.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) raised the rate at which it accepts deposits from commercial banks for six months to 21.00 from 20.75 percent, halting a recent pattern of almost monthly rate cuts.</p>
<p>The NBH also launched a 12-month deposit facility at an annual 20.50 percent rate and said in a statement that its moves were aimed at protecting savings.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to the decline of interest rates, the advantages of forint savings were disappearing,&quot; said Budapest Bank analyst Peter Bihari. &quot;If they disappear, a capital outflow may begin...&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank said in a statement that current interest rate levels and the prospect of possible further rate cuts did not encourage savings sufficently. &quot;For the long term they jeopardise further favourable changes in inflation and macroeconomic processes.&quot;</p>
<p>Interbank dealers said the NBH move hit markets &quot;like a bomb&quot;, causing yields on government securities, mainly for six- and 12-month maturities, to increase slightly. Further yield rises were likely.</p>
<p>Commerzbank dealer Sandor Tolonics said the NBH move indicated its intention to keep forint savings more attractive than foreign currency savings which offer 19 percent yield for one year.</p>
<p>&quot;If forint interest rates are too close to the yields from foreign currency savings, many investors may say that they prefer the greenback,&quot; Tolonics said.</p>
<p>Interest rates in Hungary have dropped almost continuously since the beginning of last year, in line with a 10 percent drop in year-on-year inflation.</p>
<p>Analysts said that following the past few months' interest rate decline, the NBH's concerns over real interest rates were justified, though they did not see signs of a capital outflow yet.</p>
<p>Other analysts said a slowdown in the conversion of foreign currencies into forints was a warning sign.</p>
<p>Concorde Securities analyst Peter Muszely said the NBH may have wanted to attract a larger part of the savings in short maturities, as plans for a radical inflation cut for 1998 were serious and believed longer than one year yields were too high.</p>
<p>&quot;They are considering the anti-inflationary programme very strongly,&quot; Muszely said.</p>
<p>The government commissioned Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy and central bank president Gyorgy Suranyi to work out a programme for a 1998 inflation cut, which should be larger than the originally planned five percentage points.</p>
<p>Inflation is currently running at 18.8 percent and the NBH expects it to go down to 17 percent by December, while the government and the NBH said they would consider a further cut in the monthly devaluation rate from 1.1 percent in July.</p>
