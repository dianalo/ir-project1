<p>China ended months of doubt on Wednesday when it said its head of state, President Jiang Zemin, would attend the ceremony marking the handover of Hong Kong to China at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>However, the first visit to the territory by a leader of communist China and the chief of its Communist Party would last just a few hours because Jiang must return to the Chinese capital for Beijing's celebrations of its resumption of sovereignty over the territory.</p>
<p>Jiang would lead the Chinese delegation to the Sino-British ceremony marking the transfer of power of Hong Kong to Beijing after more than 150 years of British colonial rule, the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>Jiang, who is commander-in-chief of the People's Liberation Army, will also attend a ceremony to mark the founding of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the swearing in of the new government, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen as well as other senior Chinese officials will attend the ceremonies that end what Beijing regards as one of the most humiliating eras of Chinese history.</p>
<p>A ceremony attended by 4,000 dignitaries will be staged by Britain and China to mark the sovereignty transfer.</p>
<p>Both Jiang and Li would return to the Chinese capital to attend a state banquet attended by 3,500 guests at the Great Hall of the People, Chinese officials have said.</p>
<p>Britain's heir to the throne Prince Charles will lead the British delegation at the handover ceremony.</p>
<p>Apart from Jiang, China's top military representative to the ceremonies will be Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission.</p>
<p>China will station up to 6,000 troops in Hong Kong after it resumes control of the territory and a contingent of 2,000 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army would arrive at the stroke of midnight, Hong Kong's independent Ming Pao newspaper said.</p>
<p>The remainder of the garrison would move into the territory in the early hours on July 1, it said.</p>
<p>The territory of 6.4 million has been kept in the dark by China over the size of its PLA garrison in Hong Kong.</p>
