<title>USA: CSCE cocoa ends higher, pierces nearby resistance.</title>
<headline>CSCE cocoa ends higher, pierces nearby resistance.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-03</dateline>

<p>CSCE cocoa futures rose sharply on Monday, bolstered by speculative short covering and fewer sales by cocoa producing countries, market sources said.</p>
<p>Benchmark May futures rose $29 a tonne on the day, to $1,315, having traded from $1,287 to $1,317. Spot March rose $14, to $1,260, while the remaining months gained $20 to $26.</p>
<p>Prices zig-zagged in a $30 range for much of the day, climbing toward the day's highs toward the end of the session once May managed to clear Friday's high of $1,308.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing more short-covering and less selling from the Ivory Coast,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It was impressive in light of the slightly stronger dollar,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Traders said prolonged hot, dry weather in Ivory Coast has raised fears the country's mid-crop production could be harmed. But crop analysts in the Ivory Coast have said the crop should escape significant damage as long as moisture levels improve in March.</p>
<p>While today's run-up took out a key nearby chart objective at $1,311, traders cautioned that the gains came one day after the market's $17 loss on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's still rangebound,&quot; the trader said. &quot;It's still trading between $1,275-$1,325.</p>
<p>An estimated 9,962 lots were exchanged on the day, compared with 5,959 during the previous session.</p>
