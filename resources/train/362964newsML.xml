<p>Investors should buy shares of Polish paintmaker Polifarb Cieszyn in the long term, with the firm buoyed by its planned merger with Polifarb Wroclaw, Investmentbank Austria said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;The merger will dramatically improve the new company's market position and significantly increase its profitability ....Therefore, we recommend Polifarb Cieszyn as a long-term buy,&quot; the report dated January 29 said.</p>
<p>The two firms plan to merge at mid-year.</p>
<p>Under the plan Cieszyn would raise its share capital by 2,978,820 shares to equal Wroclaw's 22,103,820 shares. Later Cieszyn would set another issue for Wroclaw shareholders and a one-for-one share exchange would take place.</p>
<p>IB Austria said cost-cutting and rationalisation from the merger would make a substantial impact in 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>For valuation purposes IB Austria used the January 29 18.9-zloty price of Polifarb Cieszyn with the assumption that its existing shareholders would receive two free shares for each 13 existing. The stock closed on Friday at 19.8 zlotys.</p>
<p>IB Austria predicted Polifarb Cieszyn would raise net profit to 19 million zlotys in 1996, 37 million in 1997 and 65 million in 1998 from 15 million zlotys in 1995.</p>
<p>Net sales would rise to 306 million zlotys in 1996, 492 million in 1997 and 710 million in 1998 from 261 million zlotys in 1995.</p>
<p>According to preliminary figures Cieszyn made a net profit of 19.1 million zlotys last year on sales of 306.5 million.</p>
<p>IB Austria saw Cieszyn's price-earnings ratio falling to 18.9 in 1996, 17.2 in 1997 and 12.9 in 1998 from 23.6 in 1995. @</p>
<p>It said that based on 1996 earnings the firm's shares traded at a premium of 32 percent to its international competitors. &quot;This year's earnings forecasts, however, yield a premium of 16 percent and 1998 forecasts result in a six-percent disount in terms of PER,&quot; the report said.</p>
