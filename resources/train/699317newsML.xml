<headline>UN agency close to food aid target for North Korea.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-07-01</dateline>

<p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said on Tuesday it had almost reached the food aid target it set for famine-threatened North Korea.</p>
<p>&quot;To date, the WFP has received almost all the $95.5 million in food aid it seeks from international donors under its current emergency operations to help prevent famine in North Korea,&quot; the Rome-based agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>The WFP launched an appeal in May this year to purchase and deliver 203,000 tonnes of emergency food aid to North Korea after the Stalinist state slid into a famine following unprecedented flooding in 1995-96.</p>
<p>The agency, which organises United Nations emergency food distribution, had said the initial response from donor countries was poor due to fears that aid would go only to Pyongyang's isolationist government.</p>
<p>The WFP said on Tuesday a ship carrying 24,953 tonnes of cereals had docked at Nampo near the North Korean capital Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&quot;The shipment will be the first food aid delivery directly to the hard-hit northeast where aid agencies have not previously been able to operate,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>South Korean government officials said on Tuesday North Korea could avoid a serious food crisis as it has an estimated 1.22 million tonnes of food in stock to help it through to the next harvest in October.</p>
<p>The WFP has estimated food would run out sometime this month.</p>
