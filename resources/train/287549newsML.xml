<title>JORDAN: Jordan market buttressed by institutional demand.</title>

<p>Jordan's stock market was steady on Sunday with healthy institutional demand but price corrections blunted further rises, dealers said.</p>
<p>The official Amman Financial Market 60-share index rose a slight 0.03 percent to 151.65 points, buttressed by improved institutional buying which helped raise turnover to a high 1,482,199 dinars ($2.1 million).</p>
<p>There was however one large bloc sale worth 547,773 dinars in Industrial Development Bank, which accounted for over a third of daily volume.</p>
<p>Also, continued selling on large capitalised firms that saw price corrections on Saturday, the new year's first trading session, helped weigh down on the market, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was good with generally healthy institutional demand but price corrections in a number of shares weakened the bourse's rise,&quot; said Mohammad Abdulah, an analyst with Pearl Consulting.</p>
<p>Stock closing levels had been artificially bolstered in stepped-up portfolio buying in the last week of 1996, especially on larger capitalised blue-chips, in window dressing transactions to reduce loss provisions.</p>
<p>Price rises in two market heavyweights, Arab Bank and Jordan Cement Factories, helped underpin the official index. The first posted a 2 dinars rise to 251 dinars and the second a 0.02 dinars gain to 3.37 dinars,</p>
<p>The market is currently underpinned by brighter performance of industrials that stand to benefit from exports to Iraq, which helped give the market a good 1997 kick-off on Saturday.</p>
<p>Most of the short-term investor focus is on drug, vegetable oils and detergent firms which have won export orders under Iraq's U.N. approved &quot;oil-for food&quot; deal, which investors say should improve half-year 1997 results.</p>
<p>Investors hopes were raised of business opportunities in the Iraqi market that could breathe new life into the Amman bourse after recent orders exceeding $100 million were secured by leading Jordanian firms under the oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Investable Index of the 45 best performing shares on the exchange shed 0.33 percent to 82.61 points from 82.88 points.</p>
<p>Losing shares outnumbered gainers on Sunday by 20 to 12, with shares in nine other firms trading but closing unchanged.</p>
