<title>UK: UK insurers want say in regulatory changes.</title>
<headline>UK insurers want say in regulatory changes.</headline>

<p>British insurers gave plans to move towards a new system of statutory regulation announced by the government on Tuesday a broad welcome, but hope to be closely involved in the changes.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown earlier announced plans to introduce reforms to UK financial services regulation which would lead to an end to the current system of self regulation.</p>
<p>&quot;We will work to make that happen as smoothly as possible,&quot; Suzanne Moore, spokeswoman for the Association of British Insurers (ABI) told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to be consulted on the practical implications of the reforms that are being drawn up and that there will be a smooth transition to the new system.&quot;</p>
<p>Moore said the proposed consolidation of the current regulatory system under the Security and Investments Board (SIB) should benefit both consumers and the insurance industry.</p>
<p>&quot;A single regulatory authority should reduce bureaucracy and the cost of compliance,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The announcement, which had been widely expected, was given a cautious welcome by insurance companies pending the publication of further details and a timetable for implementing the changes.</p>
<p>Insurers said the proposals should reduce costs and clarify uncertainties which have developed around the current system where insurers may be regulated by several different watchdogs.</p>
<p>Steve Riley, spokesman for Commercial Union, said, &quot;If the move strengthens public confidence, we support it. It's good news for the financial services industry and for consumers.&quot;</p>
<p>The insurance industry has suffered in recent years from poor publicity, in particular as a result of pensions mis-selling.</p>
<p>Tony Kerfoot, spokesman for General Accident Plc, said the proposed changes should reduce costs and introduce greater transparency, &quot;but let's wait and see the detail&quot;.</p>
<p>Life insurer Legal &amp; General Group Plc said it was in favour of efficient and effective regulation and wanted to see the changes implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Other industry sources said the creation of a single statutory body to regulate financial services should end the confusion which has resulted from the current multi-layer system.</p>
<p>Although the industry has been self regulating in theory, this has not always been the case in practice, one source said, adding that this had meant insurers had sometimes suffered the worst of both systems.</p>
<p>Prudential Corp Plc, which alone among UK life insurers, remained directly regulated by the SIB, welcomed the announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;It reflects our long held view that there should be a single system of regulation underpinned by statute,&quot; spokesman Mike Davies said.</p>
