<headline>Delhi shares end lower on late selling.</headline>

<p>Late selling by profit takers and domestic institutions drove Delhi stocks lower at close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At the end of trading, the Delhi Stock Exchange benchmark index was 7.9 points lower at 857.95.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today's session was of a purely speculative nature. Highly active stocks were bought and sold mainly by speculators,&quot; Harish Malhotra of brokerage Malhotra Financial Services said.</p>
<p>Traders said foreign institutions had extended their buying activity until mid-session, and had diluted their positions in late trading. This reversed early rising trends, they said.</p>
<p>The market commenced on a firm note after the petroleum minister was quoted by a newspaper as saying any hike in petroleum prices would be negligible.</p>
<p>After reaching a high of 327.10 rupees, Reliance Industries fell to 320.05.</p>
<p>State Bank of India fell 4.50 rupees to 325.50, after rising earlier to 335.45.</p>
<p>ITC Ltd was one of heaviest traded stocks, and lost 7.35 rupees to 495.75.</p>
<p>ACC fell 69.15 rupees to 1169.85, induced by expectations of poor working results, brokers said. The company was due to announce its results later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Larsen and Toubro fell 6.05 rupees to 235.70.</p>
<p>TELCO edged up one rupee to 440.0</p>
