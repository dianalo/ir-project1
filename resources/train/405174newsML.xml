<p>Britain's Commercial Union plans to expand its life insurance business and would be looking for acquistions to stimulate further growth, a senior company executive said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategy of more emphasis on life business has proved viable so far...We will be looking at any suitable acquisition that may come across,&quot; Peter Foster, Commercial Union's finance director, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Foster was speaking shortly after the insurance group announced its 1996 operating pretax profit, which fell to 444 million stg from 509 million.</p>
<p>Foster cited a strengthening pound vis-a-vis the other major currencies as the main reason behind the decline.</p>
<p>At comparable exchange rates, Commercial Union's operating pretax profit was 460 million stg in 1995.</p>
<p>Foster said the group was able to beat the strong pound in the last quarter of 1996 with a operating pretax profit of 123 million stg, against 121 million in the corresponding period in the previous year.</p>
<p>Measured against similar rates of exchange, the 1995 fourth quarter stood at 105 million stg.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade has so far followed the same trend this year,&quot; Foster said.  </p>
<p>Foster said the British insurance sector, which has faced pressure of declining premiums during most of the last two years, is expected to look up in 1997 with hopes for higher rates.</p>
<p>&quot;It (a resurgence) is inevitable. Though results in the UK would remain down,&quot; Foster said.</p>
<p>Foster said Commerical Union's expense ratio has been &quot;very good&quot; in the UK and has given it an advantage vis-a-vis its competitiors.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been three percent better than others,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The insurance firm, like the rest of the industry, has been forced to reduce costs including a reduction of jobs in the UK in the past few months.</p>
<p>Commercial has spent nine million stg on offering voluntary retirement schemes to nearly 300 employees, and 100 have already accepted the package.</p>
