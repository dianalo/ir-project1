<p>Burma on Wednesday vowed to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity on the eighth anniversary of a coup that thrust into power the current military government.</p>
<p>&quot;The people, the government and the Tatmadaw (armed forces) shall unitedly march forward to a new era of peace, progress and prosperity,&quot; was the banner headline of the official New Light of Myanmar (Burma) newspaper.</p>
<p>The ruling military body, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), was set up in 1988 after troops crushed seven months of unprecedented democracy protests across the country.</p>
<p>Several thousand people who had flocked to the streets to voice their desire for change were killed or imprisoned during the protests. Thousands of others fled to border areas or neighbouring countries like Thailand and India.</p>
<p>State run newspapers on Wednesday carried pages of reports detailing the SLORC's achievements over the past eight years, and outlined many more that were in the works.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in Myanmar today is quite different from that in 1988 in many aspects,&quot; said an editorial in the New Light of Myanmar. &quot;Myanmar has changed tremendously for the better these years. Law and order was restored soon after the (SLORC's) assumption of duties of the state.&quot;</p>
<p>It cited the change to a market-oriented economic system as one of the main tangible results achieved by the SLORC despite efforts from some people inside and outside Burma who were &quot;against such progress.&quot;</p>
<p>But pro-democracy groups disagreed with the achievements of the SLORC, which has been widely accused of human rights abuses and condemned for its failure to restore democracy.</p>
<p>The SLORC never recognised a 1990 general election which the National League for Democracy (NLD) party won in landslide. Although the SLORC organised the poll, it never allowed the NLD to take power but instead launched a tough crackdown against the elected NLD politicians, arresting many who won in the vote.</p>
<p>NLD leader and Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest during the election, has called on the government to accept the vote ever since she was released from six years of detention in July, 1995.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi was not available for comment on Wednesday but she has made repeated unanswered appeals to the government for dialogue with the opposition and ethnic groups to try and find a way to restore democracy in to Burma.</p>
<p>A recent report by Amnesty International said the human right situation has deteriorated sharply in Burma, with increased arrests and sentencing of political prisoners and growing pressure on opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Exiled pro-democracy supporters also condemed the SLORC on Wednesday, and vowed to continue the struggle to change the Burma government.</p>
<p>&quot;At present the situation in Burma is at its worst as never experienced before in all the history of the country,&quot; said an exiled group of the NLD in a statement received in Bangkok.</p>
