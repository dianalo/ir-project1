<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin moved to a new hospital on Friday, three days after heart surgery, as aides prepared what they said would be a vigorous return to the political stage after months of inactivity.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's doctors made clear their 65-year-old patient was itching to get back to work as he left Moscow's Cardiology Research Centre on Friday, moving to the Central Clinical Hospital to continue his recovery from a quintuple bypass.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the president is gaining strength very quickly,&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists. The main task of those around him was to &quot;save him from overload&quot;.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was &quot;already in control of basic questions and will soon return to normal work&quot;, Chernomyrdin told Russian news agencies while visiting a veterans' hospital near Moscow.</p>
<p>The presidential press service said Yeltsin was in satisfactory condition after the transfer, which was authorised by his doctors at an early morning meeting.</p>
<p>His press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the president had requested recordings of his favourite composers -- Mozart, Vivaldi and Tchaikovsky.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that when a man who is recovering asks for his favourite music, that is the best sign of his return to health,&quot; Yastrzhembsky told Russian NTV television.</p>
<p>&quot;The patient is walking around the ward and eats three meals a day alone and unaided,&quot; Yastrzhembsky added.</p>
<p>Doctors said his circulation, temperature, pulse and blood pressure were all normal and Yeltsin's movements would gradually be increased.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has been visited by Chernomyrdin, by his chief of staff Anatoly Chubais and by members of his family. No further appointments were scheduled for Friday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin used Thursday's anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution to unveil a new political initiative, a &quot;Year of Agreement and Reconciliation&quot; -- a move likely to embarrass the communist-led opposition.</p>
<p>His decree announced that November 7, a holiday sacred to communists as the anniversary of the Bolshevik uprising in 1917, would now be known as the &quot;Day of Agreement and Reconciliation&quot;. Up to now the anniversary has left Russians divided.</p>
<p>Next year's 80th anniversary with its new theme will be coordinated by a state committee headed by Chernomyrdin in which the opposition parties will be invited to take part.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reaction from Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who got 40 percent of the vote in the second round of the presidential elections in July. Analysts said he faced a dilemma in how to respond.</p>
<p>In March 1994 Yeltsin organised a reconciliation pact between Russia's parties and institutions but the Communists refused to sign. Since then Zyuganov has toned down his party's confrontation with Yeltsin's government and in August voted to confirm Chernomyrdin in office.</p>
<p>If Zyuganov accepts Yeltsin's offer of a seat on the commission, which will organise events and monuments to commemorate the millions of victims of Russia's bloodstained 20th century history, his hardline supporters could accuse him of selling out and betraying his communist ideals.</p>
<p>If he refuses, the communists will remain isolated and vulnerable to charges that they are standing in the way of national reconciliation.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Yeltsin offered the Communist speaker of the Duma (lower house), Gennady Seleznyov, a seat on a new four-member ad hoc committee to be chaired by Chernomyrdin to coordinate affairs of state.</p>
<p>Seleznyov turned down the offer, objecting to the presence of Yeltsin's chief of staff Anatoly Chubais, but the Communist Party appeared ill at ease over how to respond. Zyuganov has been calling without success for a &quot;government of national interests&quot; in which all parties would be represented.</p>
<p>The next stage in presenting Yeltsin's return to the fray as a strong president is likely to be a radio or television address from the hospital. Because of his absence from the Kremlin since his re-election, Yeltsin's second term has been overshadowed by Kremlin infighting and drift over policy.</p>
<p>&quot;You're going to see a vigorous leader,&quot; Michael DeBakey, the pioneering U.S. surgeon who advised on the surgery, said after meeting Yeltsin on Thursday, adding that the president had heeded doctors' pleas to stay another day in the emergency room.</p>
<p>DeBakey also said the presidential liver did not bear the tell-tale marks of heavy drinking which Yeltsin has, despite repeated Kremlin denials, been reputed to indulge in.</p>
<p>In fact, the 88-year-old Texan doctor said, the president could even allow himself the odd booze binge if he wanted. But he will have to cut down on fatty Russian sausages.</p>
