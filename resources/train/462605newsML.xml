<p>Robusta coffee futures took a sharp drop on Monday on a heavy sell-off by investment funds which analysts say was linked to weak technicals rather than supply/demand factors.</p>
<p>In one of the steepest losses in recent months, the benchmark May contract dived by 7.7 percent or $128 to the day's low of $1,535 a tonne before recovering slightly.</p>
<p>By the close, the contract was traded $123 lower at $1,540. The spot March position also posted triple-digit losses.</p>
<p>Monday's fall to the lowest level in nearly four weeks marked a sharp reversal from the recent blistering rally, which had lifted values by more than 50 percent since the start of 1997.</p>
<p>Heavy fund and speculative buying had propelled the rally as London chased a more spectacular bull run on New York's arabica futures.</p>
<p>But prices on both London and New York have started to come down since mid-March as the recent tight arabica supply situation showed signs of easing.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, people turned negative quite quickly,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;Sentiment has changed.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said Monday's sharp descent in robusta was weighed down by fund long liquidation which was triggered by a weak chart outlook.</p>
<p>May broke the closely-watched $1,600 support early in the session and then moved lower quickly, triggering various stop-loss selling.</p>
<p>The market's recent sharp upward move had left many chart gaps unfilled.</p>
<p>Traders noted further downside potential but May could find some support at $1,502 on roaster demand.</p>
<p>Some funds were seen rolling forward their sizeable May positions further forward. May will become the spot month after March expires at the of this month.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the robusta outlook has not changed much. Supplies are still ample and the market is bracing for the main Indonesian crop due to be shipped in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>But demand is consistent with roasters continuing to buy to meet fill-in demand.</p>
<p>The recent wide price difference between arabica and robusta has encouraged roasters to raise robusta usage for the lower-tier of the market.</p>
<p>The arbitrage has narrowed to around 91 cents a lb from a high of over 120 cents in the past weeks. But traders said it should narrow further to a more realistic 60 cent level. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
