<headline>Marvel Entertainment Q3 loss expected.</headline>

<p>Marvel Entertainment Group Inc said on Tuesday that it expects to report a net loss for the third quarter ended September 20 of between $0.07 and $0.12, including a non-recurring, pre-tax gain of about $22 million.</p>
<p>The company attributed the loss to continued weakness in its trading card, publishing and consumer products licensing businesses.</p>
<p>It said those market conditions are expected to result in a net loss for its fourth quarter and year-end results ending December 31.  </p>
<p>Marvel Entertainment said it failed to satisfy certain financial covenants contained in its bank credit facilities and has begun discussions with its agent bank seeking waivers and a restructuring of the facilities to provide for its cash requirements.</p>
<p>The company believes that such a restructuring will ultimately require an infusion of new equity capital. It also has begun discussions to obtain the necessary funds to meet its current and long-term needs.</p>
<p>The one-time gain of $22 million is from its sale of shares of Toy Biz Inc in August.  </p>
<p>The company expects to report its third quarter earnings in early November. For the third quarter in 1995, Marvel reported net income of $0.19 per share.</p>
