<title>USA: US credit card delinquencies rise in Q4 '96.</title>

<p>As concern grows about mounting U.S. credit card debt, new evidence emerged on Thursday that consumers are having difficulty managing their borrowings.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 1996, 3.72 percent of credit card accounts had late payments, up from 3.34 percent in the same period of 1995 and the highest rate since the American Bankers Association began tracking delinquencies in 1980.</p>
<p>The seasonally adjusted figure also showed a rise from the previous quarter, when 3.48 percent of accounts had late payments.  </p>
<p>Some regulators have sought to assuage concerns about mounting consumer debt by pointing to banks tightening standards for approving credit card applications. But in the fourth quarter of 1996, 37 percent of banks reported tightening standards, a drop from 49 percent in both the second and third quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We are disappointed that the numbers didn't improve,&quot; ABA chief economist James Chessen said. &quot;We had hoped that banks' tightening of credit standards over the last several years would have reversed the trend of delinquencies by now.&quot;</p>
<p>Delinquency rates also ticked up on home equity loans. The delinquency rate was 1.42 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 compared to 1.29 percent in the previous quarter and 1.41 percent in the same period the previous year.</p>
<p>On auto loans, the delinquency rate was 2.03 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 compared to 1.95 percent the previous quarter and 1.87 percent a year earlier.</p>
<p>Delinquent payments are defined as 30 days or more overdue based on the total number of loans outstanding.</p>
