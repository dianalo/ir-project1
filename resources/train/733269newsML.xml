<p>CSCE coffee futures were called to open 1.00 to 2.00 cents per lb lower on Wednesday, as a build in U.S. consumer coffee stocks during June is expected to weigh on sentiment, traders said.</p>
<p>The Green Coffee Association of New York report after Tuesday's close that supplies of green coffee stowed in U.S. warehouses rose in June by 139,000 60-kg bags, to 2,116,000 bags.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said the increase was mostly within expectations, with most estimates coming in at plus or minus 100,000 bags, although some market participants had predicted a build of up to 200,000 bags.</p>
<p>They said a build-up in inventories was partially priced in the market after Tuesday's fall to more than three-month lows.</p>
<p>&quot;I think among the trade it was expected,&quot; one dealer said regarding the increase in GCA stocks. &quot;But you might see some spec selling off the number.&quot;</p>
<p>Speculative selling pressured New York arabica futures for the second day in a row on Tuesday, with September falling 4.15 cents, to 157.85 cents, after ranging between 159.50 and 156.25 cents. Spot July, which expires in less than a week, ended 2.50 cents lower, at 184.50 cents, while the outer months closed down 0.05 to 3.60 cents.</p>
<p>The July/September switch widened to 26.65 cents compared with 25.00 cents at the close on Monday, while the September/December switch narrowed to 11.95 cents from 12.50 cents.</p>
<p>After the close on Tuesday, CSCE reported certified coffee stocks in the U.S. warehouses fell for the first time in more than a week, dipping 100 60-kg bags as of July 14, to 72,145 bags.</p>
<p>However, there were an additional 36,182 bags pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>On the weather front, U.S.-based forecaster Weather Services Corp said on Wednesday that there is no damaging cold weather expected this week in Brazil's coffee belt, with the lowest temperatures in major coffee-growing areas likely to remain above 50 F (10 C) through Monday.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said the September contract would run into some chart support at 155.00 cents, followed by 150.00 cents. On the upside, they said September faced resistance at 160.00 cents.</p>
<p>London robusta futures slumped early Wednesday on continued speculative selling, but managed to recover off lows. At the midday break, benchmark September was down $39 at $1,546, after ranging from $1,586 to $1,530 -- its lowest level since February 25.</p>
