<p>The centre-right Czech coalition government on Wednesday narrowly won a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament after giving into demands that the house get a vote in key banking and utility privatisations.</p>
<p>In a dramatic vote along party lines, the government won 101 votes in the 200-seat house, combining the 100 votes which the three-party ruling coalition controls with the vote of an independent deputy, budget committee chairman Jozef Wagner.  </p>
<p>Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus earlier on Tuesday called for a vote of confidence in his embattled cabinet. Its programme aims to tackle an economic downturn and a sharp depreciation in the Czech crown.</p>
<p>Wagner made his support for the cabinet conditional on the lower house getting a vote on privatisations of state stakes in banks and utilities which have already been proposed by the finance ministry.</p>
<p>Klaus, who rejected Wagner's suggestion just minutes before, reversed himself after a hastily called meeting with Wagner and said the cabinet would submit the privatisations to the house. This came after an ill Communist deputy showed up who had not been expected to participate in the tight vote.</p>
<p>The government, in seeking the vote of confidence, put forward an austerity programme seeking to cut an additional 20 billion crowns ($625 million) in spending and social transfers from the 1997 budget as a way to cut domestic demand and stem a widening current account deficit.</p>
