<headline>UK Labour highlights broken Conservative promises.</headline>

<p>Britain's opposition Labour Party on Wednesday tried to spoil the launch of the Conservative manifesto by highlighting what it said were 92 promises made by the ruling party at the 1992 election which had not been kept.</p>
<p>Trade and Industry spokeswoman Margaret Beckett told a news conference: &quot;They have shown that you couldn't trust what they said in their last manifesto. Why should anyone trust what they say this time?&quot;</p>
<p>Among the promises that Labour accuses the Conservatives of breaking were pledges to reduce taxes as quickly as prudently possible and to ensure that Britain was at the heart of the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;They fought the last election campaign chiefly on tax. They didn't just fail to deliver on the promises they made then, they did the exact opposite as everyone now knows - not tax cuts but 22 new tax increases,&quot; Beckett said.</p>
<p>She pointed to the fact that Prime Minister John Major said in a press interview at the weekend that he had been careless to say that he wanted Britain to remain &quot;at the heart of Europe&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Time and again the record of this government shows not only that they promise one thing and do another but that their instinctive bias produces policies likely at best to benefit only a few,&quot; Beckett said.</p>
