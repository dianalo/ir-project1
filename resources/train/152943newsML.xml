<p>The Wallabies began the Scottish leg of their European tour with a 47-20 victory over Scotland A on Wednesday, but look set to lose Jason Little and Michael Brial for a significant period.</p>
<p>Centre Little sustained a knee injury and flanker Brial was taken to hospital for X-rays on a possible broken ankle, although he was later found to have damaged ankle ligaments.</p>
<p>&quot;The diagnosis on Jason is not so good, but he will be staying with us on tour,&quot; said coach Greg Smith. &quot;I understand it is medial ligament damage in his knee, but I have been told it could just be a 10-day injury.&quot;</p>
<p>A haul of 27 points from full-back Matt Burke ensured the Australians won comfortably enough, despite a stuttering first-half display which saw them ahead just 13-11 at the interval.</p>
<p>Converted tries in the second-half from Tim Horan, Burke, Mark Connors and Sam Payne made the Scots pay for losing their concentration, although coach Smith was less than impressed.</p>
<p>&quot;I was disappointed because of the amount of ball that was turned over, especially in the first-half. I can't make excuses for players. They should all be able to pass and catch the ball without dropping it.&quot;</p>
<p>Scotland A manager Doug Morgan felt several of his players could earn places in the full Scotland team to face the Wallabies on November 9.</p>
