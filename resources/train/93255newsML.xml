<headline>Briton accused of Celine's murder &quot;kept belongings&quot;.</headline>

<p>A British truck driver accused of murdering French student Celine Figard kept a collection of her belongings hidden behind a wall in his garage, a court was told on Thursday.</p>
<p>Police found photographs of Celine, a 19-year-old accountancy student, a letter written in French by her cousin, and her toilet bag, prosecution lawyer David Farrer told a jury at Worcester Crown Court in central England.</p>
<p>Police also found a blood-soaked bunk bed from the cab of driver Stuart Morgan's lorry, and its cover. Rolls of tape which may have been used to tie Celine's hands while she was attacked were also discovered.</p>
<p>&quot;What possible explanation could there be for that blood on that bunk in that garage at that time other than the killing of Celine Figard by battering over the head whilst she lay on that bunk?&quot; Farrer asked.</p>
<p>Morgan, 37, believed that by removing the bunk and attempting to clean up the inside of the cab he had removed the traces of what he had done, Farrer said.</p>
<p>Morgan, from Parkstone, Dorset, in southern England, denies murdering Celine, from Ferrieres-les-Scey, a village near Besancon, in eastern France, just before Christmas last year.</p>
<p>The court has been told that Morgan had kept Celine's dead body in his lorry for up to 10 days last Christmas.</p>
<p>Jean-Marc Figard, the victim's cousin, said in a statement read to the court that she had first come to England in July 1995 to work in the Ashbourne Hotel, Fordingbridge, where he was head waiter.</p>
<p>Some time in December last year, he said, Celine said she intended visiting over Christmas.</p>
<p>On Monday December 18 she telephoned to say she was on her way. But by December 20 she had not arrived and he contacted his parents in France and then reported her missing to British police.</p>
<p>Morgan denies murdering Celine. But Farrer said he admitted to police having sex with her after picking her up from a motorway service station on December 19 last year.</p>
<p>Farrer said there was an overwhelming case suggesting Morgan killed Celine and kept her body in his cab.</p>
<p>&quot;He dumped the body far from home on his first opportunity on his return to work after the Christmas break,'' he said.</p>
<p>Farrer said Morgan had tried to cover his tracks by changing the tachograph reading in the cab of his lorry.</p>
<p>Celine's parents, Bernard and Martine, who attended the trial sat at the back of the courtroom listening to a simultaneous translation and taking notes.</p>
