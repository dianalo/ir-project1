<p>Toronto stocks soared to new heights with Wall Street on Monday as Canada's biggest stock market set new closing and intra-day records.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index climbed 22.59 points to close at 5265.86, eclipsing the previous record of 5246.40 set on May 31.</p>
<p>The index also set a new intra-day high of 5271.06.</p>
<p>In New York, the Dow Industrials finished at an all-time closing high of 5888, just shy of the key 5900 barrier.</p>
<p>&quot;There is feeling that the Federal Reserve is not going to raise (U.S. interest) rates,&quot; said Ira Katzin, an investment adviser with Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.</p>
<p>Katzin said last week's U.S. economic data calmed fears of inflation and showed the U.S. economy is growing moderately.</p>
<p>The numbers suggest that the Fed will not raise short-term U.S. interest rates at its policy meeting on September 24.</p>
<p>In today's action, Toronto's strong side was led by golds, banking, conglomerates, retailing and consumer products.</p>
<p>The TSE's three weak groups were communications, energy and forestry products. Katzin said the paper group was depressed by falling newsprint prices, while energy stocks were hit by diving oil prices.</p>
<p>Trading was heavy with 77.8 million shares exchanging hands for a total value of C$1.23 billion ($898 million).</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Nickel giant Inco Ltd. closed up 0.20 at 43.35 on 1.3 million shares. Inco said it will keep customers supplied during the current lockout at its Thompson, Manitoba mine.</p>
<p>* Among technology stocks, Newbridge Networks Corp. jumped 2.60 to 96 after announcing a partnerhip with MPR Teltech.</p>
<p>Corel Corp. sank 1.40 to 12.45 after surprising investors with a third-quarter loss projection earlier today.</p>
<p>* Takeover target Morgan Hydrocarbons Ltd. was TSE's heaviest trader, easing 0.05 to 4.55 on 4.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Among other energy stocks, Imperial Oil slumped 1.10 to 58.90. Crestar Energy Inc. bucked the losing trend, rising 0.75 to 27.</p>
