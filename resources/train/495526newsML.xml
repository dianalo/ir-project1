<p>Iran's ambassador to Saudi Arabia was quoted on Tuesday as saying the two countries were determined to upgrade their political and economic relations.</p>
<p>Iran's official news agency IRNA, in a report from Mecca in Saudi Arabia, said envoy Mohammad Reza Nouri Shahroudi stressed on Monday there was a strong will to bolster bilateral cooperation in all fields.</p>
<p>He said greater understanding between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the biggest producers in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, would help stabilise and increase oil prices in the interest of the two countries' peoples.</p>
<p>Nouri expressed hope that along with &quot;upgrading political ties bilateral economic relations will be fashioned in an appropriate manner&quot;.</p>
<p>Relations between Tehran and Riyadh have been strained since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>
<p>The annual pilgrimage to Mecca is usually a time of heightened tension because of Iran's insistence on its pilgrims holding political rallies against the United States and Israel in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Nouri said the cooperation of Saudi officials in providing facilities for Iranian pilgrims during next week's haj was one example of many fundamental and diplomatic measures taken in recent months to consolidate bilateral ties, Nouri said.</p>
<p>The Iranian diplomat said Iran and Saudi Arabia could meet each other's needs through cooperation.</p>
<p>He said the establishment of security and tranquillity in the Gulf depended on cooperation between them. The world had come to realise that in practice it was impossible to ignore Iran's role in this sensitive region, he added.</p>
