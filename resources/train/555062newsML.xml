<title>HONG KONG: Wharf says to contest U.S. court award.</title>
<headline>Wharf says to contest U.S. court award.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wharf (Holdings) Ltd said on that it intended to contest a US$125.5 million Denver federal district court judgement against it, its Wharf Communications Investments Ltd unit and managing director Stephen Ng.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is considering exactly what steps it will take next, but intends vigorously to contest the award,&quot; the company said in a statement published on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;This could include asking the Denver District Court, as well as United States Appellate Court, to set aside or at least substantially reduce the award. The company believes it has substantial grounds for doing so,&quot; Wharf added.</p>
<p>The United States District Court for the District of Colorado awarded US$67 million in compensatory damages and US$58.5 million in exemplary damages to United International Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>United International Holdings said it had accused Wharf of fraud, breach of promise and engaging in a pattern of deceit regarding its involvement in helping United secure a cable franchise in Hong Kong.  </p>
<p>&quot;The essence of UIH's case was that it was promised an oral option in October 1992 to acquire a 10 percent interest in Wharf Cable Limited. The company (Wharf) has consistently responded that the parties never reached agreement on any such option,&quot; Wharf said in the statement.</p>
<p>It said while United had made a contribution to the Wharf Cable project in 1992 and early 1993, the award was &quot;totally out of proportion&quot; with United's cost or any benefit from United's effort.</p>
<p>Wharf said it had consistently asserted that the dispute should have been resolved in Hong Kong. &quot;Among other things, Hong Kong law does not recognise exemplary damages. It also does not provide for a jury trial for a case of this nature.&quot;</p>
<p>Wharf said that the steps it would take in dealing with the ruling were likely to take many months.</p>
<p>It noted that its Wharf Cable unit had accumulated substantial losses since it began operations in 1993 and reiterated that Wharf Cable was expected to achieve its first year of operating surplus in 1998.</p>
<p>It said the unit was not expected to achieve any yearly profit before tax before the year 2000.</p>
