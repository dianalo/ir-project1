<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Ex-Rhodesian denies Palme murder accusation.</title>
<headline>Ex-Rhodesian denies Palme murder accusation.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1996-09-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A former Rhodesian special forces soldier named as the assassin of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme dismissed the allegation on Monday as &quot;nebulous and far-fetched&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I can only express extreme shock and disappointment (at the allegation),&quot; Ant White told Reuters in a telephone interview from his timber business in Beira, Mozambique.</p>
<p>South African Dirk Coetzee, self-confessed leader of an apartheid-era hit squad, told Swedish journalists over the weekend that he had heard White carried out the murder of Palme in Stockholm in 1986.</p>
<p>Palme was a staunch opponent of the white minority government then in power in South Africa and his killer has never been brought to book.</p>
<p>White said Coetzee's statements carried no weight.</p>
<p>&quot;It's untrue, I was not involved. I do not even have to defend myself, there's nothing for me to defend myself against,&quot; White said.</p>
<p>&quot;The very people who made these allegations will soon retract them because they are so nebulous and far-fetched...</p>
<p>&quot;I'm making myself available to the appropriate authorities so they can investigate and vindicate me,&quot; White said.</p>
<p>Asked where he had been in 1986, White said: &quot;I was probably at home with my family on the day Palme was killed.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he had no idea why Coetzee, who he said he had never met, had spread the allegations.</p>
<p>White's former commanding officer in the Selous Scouts, a special forces unit that fought to keep Ian Smith's white government in power in the then Rhodesia, described him as an excellent soldier.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all totally pissed off at these cowards who are trying to put the blame onto everyone else,&quot; said Ron Reid-Daly, who is now living in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Coetzee's successor at the security police dirty tricks unit, Eugene de Kock, rekindled speculation about who killed Palme when he told a Pretoria court last week that fellow-agent Craig Williamson was to blame.</p>
<p>Williamson, who has admitted to three bombings against anti-apartheid activists, strenuously denied the accusation. He and White worked together in the 1980s in a company called Long Reach which was involved in intelligence gathering for Pretoria.</p>
