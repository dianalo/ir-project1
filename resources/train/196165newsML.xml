<p>Kazakhstan's debut Eurobond will be issued in the second week of December, former deputy national bank chairman Grigory Marchenko said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The roadshow goes to London, Geneva and New York in the first week of December so I think the placement should be in the second week of December,&quot; Marchenko told Reuters in an interview in the Kazakh capital Almaty.</p>
<p>Marchenko was last week made chairman of the former Soviet republic's National Securities Commission after two years as deputy chairman at the national bank where he was closely involved with the Eurobond issue.</p>
<p>He said he would be travelling with the roadshow to promote the $100 million three-year bond, to be lead managed by ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Kazakhstan secured a Ba3 long-term rating for foreign currency bonds, and BB- ratings from both Standard and Poor's and London-based IBCA.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the ratings were acceptable at this stage because we're newcomers to the international market,&quot; Marchenko said.</p>
<p>He said the oil-rich Central Asian nation's macroeconomic condition was better than that of comparable countries -- Russia, Turkey and Romania. But he added the rating agencies were concerned by &quot;the lack of outlets to international markets for our (Kazakh) oil&quot;.</p>
