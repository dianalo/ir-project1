<p>Pressure mounted on India's Congress party on Thursday to strike a bargain with the government to resolve a political crisis as the ruling coalition held out the threat of snap elections.</p>
<p>Leaders of the United Front coalition stood firm behind Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda in the face of a challenge by Congress president Sitaram Kesri, who has threatened to topple the 10-month-old government and staked a claim to power.</p>
<p>The lower house of parliament is scheduled to take up a vote of confidence in Deve Gowda on April 11.</p>
<p>United Front and Congress leaders were holding secret meetings to explore a possible negotiated solution to the crisis, which has held hostage the path-breaking, tax-cutting budget for the 1997/98 fiscal year that started on April 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Informal talks are on,&quot; United Front spokesman Jaipal Reddy told Reuters.</p>
<p>United Front leaders predicted Congress would eventually withdraw its threat to bring down the government because it was reluctant to face mid-term polls after suffering its worst defeat last year in general elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Congressmen think Kesri is heading them towards a snap poll, and a snap poll is last thing the Congress party can afford,&quot; Reddy said.</p>
<p>A recent opinion poll showed that the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would stand to gain at Congress's expense if elections were held now.</p>
<p>The BJP and its allies control 193 votes in the 542-member lower house. The United Front has 180 votes and Congress 140. Deve Gowda would need a simple majority of members present and voting to win the confidence motion.</p>
<p>Another United Front leader said: &quot;We expect Congressmen will in due course revolt against Mr Kesri.&quot;</p>
<p>The ruling coalition drew confidence from its relatively strong regional base, which contrasted with Congress's dismal performance in recent polls in the major states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure that the Congress leaders will re-think and refrain from forcing the country into another election and instead sort out problems through dialogue,&quot; Harkishan Singh Surjeet, general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), wrote in the Hindu newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;Otherwise, political parties will be left with no course but to seek a fresh mandate.&quot;</p>
<p>Congress put on a brave face. &quot;On the 11th, the prime minister will be voted out,&quot; spokesman Vithal Gadgil said. &quot;We expect the United Front to support us as we have them.&quot;</p>
<p>But Gadgil acknowledged that Congress had no desire to face the electorate, saying: &quot;We don't want elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts and newspapers said Congress appeared to be looking for a face-saving way out of the crisis. &quot;Congress seems to be in total disarray,&quot; The Statesman said.</p>
<p>The Times of India carried a cartoon showing a car flying a Congress party flag caught between two sides of a ravine marked &quot;Bad Timing&quot; and &quot;Dark Prospects&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this the short cut you had in mind for your office as PM, Mr Kesri?&quot; one of the passengers asks.</p>
<p>Independent political analyst Rasheed Talib said the crisis could deepen but there was pressure on Congress to reach a solution. &quot;I have a feeling it will be defused,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Congress could agree to enter the United Front government in exchange for private assurances that Deve Gowda would be replaced at a later date by a compromise leader, Talib said.</p>
<p>Kesri said on Tuesday that he was prepared to accept another candidate from the United Front to replace Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>In that case, parliament would pass the budget next week and refrain from a confidence vote.</p>
