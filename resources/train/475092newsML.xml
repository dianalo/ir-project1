<p>Unfancied Cyprus held Russia to a 1-1 draw in an action-packed group five World Cup qualifier on Saturday.</p>
<p>After being held to a draw by Israel last time out, Russia had hoped for a convincing win to regain control of the group.</p>
<p>They poured everything into attack for the opening half hour, creating -- and missing -- several chances.</p>
<p>But it was the home side who took an unexpected lead in the 31st minute when striker Sinica Gogic headed home a Nick Papavassiliou corner.</p>
<p>Russia hit back within a minute when Igor Simutenkov scored following a free kick.</p>
<p>Russia had most of the game in the second half but failed to break down the well-organised Cypriot defence.</p>
<p>However, with seconds to go Alexander Mostovoi found himself unmarked three metres from goal but shot wide.</p>
<p>Russia tops the standings with eight points from four games but could be overhauled on Sunday when Israel, currently on seven points, visit Luxembourg. Bulgaria are third on six points and play Cyprus on April 2.</p>
<p>Saturday's draw was a boost for Cyprus who lost 3-1 at home to Bulgaria in December.</p>
<p>Injuries kept at least seven players out of the match but the replacements proved up to the task.</p>
