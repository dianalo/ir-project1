<p>A tax protester was sentenced to 36 years in prison on Thursday for trying to blow up the U.S. Internal Revenue Service building in Reno.</p>
<p>Joseph Bailie, 42, was found guilty in June of three charges in connection with the failed attack on the tax agency last December.</p>
<p>The 100-pound (45 kg) fertiliser and fuel oil bomb was found in the car park of the IRS building in Reno. Its three-foot (one-metre) long fuse had burned out and it did not explode.</p>
<p>Passing sentence, U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben said Bailie was guilty of &quot;lawless and wanton conduct&quot; with what he called substantial potential for causing serious harm to people and property.</p>
<p>Bailie, who had been convicted of conspiracy, the attempted destruction of a government building and the use of an explosive device in the commission of a crime, was also ordered to make restitution to the IRS of $141,000.</p>
<p>The Reno bomb was made of similar materials to the one that blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City last year and killed 168 people.</p>
