<p>Yugoslavia retained their men's European title on Sunday by outclassing previously unbeaten Italy 61-49 in the final.</p>
<p>In a game dominated by defenders, the Yugoslavs made the best of their scoring chances.</p>
<p>With the defences so clearly in control, the raw talent of the powerful Yugoslav squad won out, particularly in the rebound department.</p>
<p>The Yugoslavs were also able to stem the scoring of Italy's Carlton Myers and Gregor Fucka, who had inflicted a 74-69 defeat on the reigning champions early in the tournament.</p>
<p>Myers scored 17 points and Fucka 12 but no other Italian player could manage more than six.</p>
<p>Italy wasted their first 10 possesions and took nearly seven minutes to clock up their first points, while poor shooting from both teams kept the score at the break down to just 28-23.</p>
<p>The Italians pulled up to within just two points after the break, but the Yugoslavs outscored their opponents 13-1 in a crucial burst which took them into a commanding 43-29 lead.</p>
<p>The holders snuffed out a brief Italian revival, and with guard Alexendar Djordjevic in control, were able to cruise to victory.</p>
<p>Djordjevic, who plays in Spain with Barcelona, was voted most valuable player of the tournament.</p>
<p>Russia beat Greece 97-77 in the third place game.</p>
