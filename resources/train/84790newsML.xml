<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and security chief Alexander Lebed discussed plans on Monday to bolster peace in Chechnya by establishing a coalition government in the region.</p>
<p>But more than 90 parliamentary deputies underscored their opposition to the peace process, questioning the constitutionality of an agreement signed on August 31 between Lebed and Chechen rebel chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said Lebed informed Chernomyrdin about preparations for a new round of peace talks in Moscow this week with Chechen separatist representatives.</p>
<p>But it was not clear if pro-independence leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev would take part in the meeting, scheduled for October 1-5 and aimed at consolidating the peace accord signed in the southern town of Khasavyurt.</p>
<p>Tass said Chernomyrdin and Lebed discussed a planned coalition government, preparations for elections, financial support for the region and Russian troop withdrawals, which some rebel leaders say are going too slowly for their liking.</p>
<p>The peace deal, which ended 21 months of war, followed a series of humiliating defeats for Russian troops. It has been condemned as capitulation to the rebels by some Russian officials, including powerful Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov.</p>
<p>The deal postponed a decision on Chechnya's future political status, but some Russian politicians say it could lead to Chechnya seceding, which would go against the Russian constitution and might set a precedent for other regions.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, who will stand in for President Boris Yeltsin when he undergoes heart surgery later this year, has said that the territorial integrity of Russia remains sacrosanct.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said 93 deputies in the 450-seat State Duma lower chamber of parliament signed a petition asking the Constitutional Court to consider the implications of the Khasavyurt agreement.</p>
<p>The Russian-Chechen talks in Moscow this week are expected to focus on the composition of a coalition government. The main question mark hangs over who would lead such a government.</p>
<p>The separatist side are unlikely to accept the present pro-Moscow Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev whom they brand as a puppet elected as a result of massive ballot-rigging.</p>
<p>A meeting of Chechen social and political organisations in the North Caucasus region of Kabardino-Balkaria put forward its candidate at the weekend.</p>
<p>Tass said 124 delegates nominated Adam-Shamal Deniyev, the 35-year-old leader of a little-known organisation called &quot;The Government for Salvation of the Chechen People&quot;.</p>
<p>Deniyev is from the village of Avtura in the Shali region of Chechnya, just south of the capital Grozny.</p>
<p>He is virtually unknown outside of Chechnya, but Tass quoted a source in Chechnya's pro-Moscow administration as saying he had &quot;more influence and hidden levers of power in Chechnya than Yandarbiyev and Maskhadov combined.&quot;</p>
<p>Former Russian parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, an ethnic Chechen now heading a group of advisers to Yandarbiyev, told Reuters he had proposed to Lebed a candidate to head the coalition government. But he declined to name his choice.</p>
<p>Khasbulatov said Lebed tried to make a case for another person taking the job. &quot;Perhaps you would (take the position),&quot; Khasbulatov quoted Lebed as saying. &quot;But I said we are not talking about me. I named another person.&quot;</p>
