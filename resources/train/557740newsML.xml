<headline>KL blue chips extend gains after holiday.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kuala Lumpur blue chips extended a rise after the Labour Day break, staging a small rally in early trading as key stocks like Tenaga Nasional provided support.</p>
<p>The state-controlled electric utility was granted an 8.3 percent tariff increase effective May 1. Analysts said the rate boost will increase profits. Its shares gained 10 cents to 11.70 ringgit at 0207 GMT.</p>
<p>At 0212 GMT, the Composite Index of 100 leading stocks gained 2.79 points to 1,082.96 after getting as high as 1,084.71.  </p>
<p>&quot;You've got some stocks that were oversold coming back,&quot; said an institutional dealer with a local brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Investor hesitation to buy aggressively rests on the view that stock prices may yet get cheaper, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;People say that maybe it (the market) is coming down further,&quot; said a dealer with a large domestic broker, adding that he had received just one buy order this week.</p>
<p>Several finance stocks were among the early gainers. Financial service and banking issues have been under pressure following concerns about new restrictions on lending for property and stock purchases announced in late March.</p>
<p>Suria Capital rose 32 cents to 2.95 ringgit and MBf Capital gained 56 cents to 4.28 ringgit.</p>
<p>At 0215 GMT, total volume was 44 million shares, and gainers narrowly led losers by 164 to 155.</p>
