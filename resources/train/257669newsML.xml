<p>Partners in European aerospace company Airbus would find it more urgent to resolve their differences and agree on a plan for the future in light of news that two big U.S. rivals are merging, an aerospace industry executive said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The $13.3 billion merger plan announced earlier between Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp means the Airbus Industrie shareholders had &quot;to get their act together quickly,&quot; said the executive, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>An Airbus spokeswoman declined to comment on the merger.  </p>
<p>Officials at French state-owned SNI Aerospatiale were not available for comment.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't comment on things happening in North America,&quot;</p>
<p>The executive said the merger &quot;clarifies the situation&quot; as &quot;Boeing and Airbus were most often the end-competitors with the customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Airbus is a consortium made up of Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.  </p>
<p>The Airbus partners are in talks over the winter on how to change the grouping into a joint stock company from the present &quot;groupement d'interet economique&quot; (GIE) partnership. The aim is to create a more competitive and responsive organisation .</p>
<p>&quot;The need for the Europeans to integrate becomes more urgent,&quot; the executive said. The merger move showed &quot;the arguments (between partners) are trivial.&quot;</p>
<p>Previous major consolidation moves in the United States between fierce competitors such as Lockheed and Martin Marietta, and now Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, showed all that was needed was the ability to look ahead and for the political will to exist.</p>
<p>The internal debate over the shape and scope of the future Airbus has run on for years and a memorandum of understanding was due at the end of this year. The new Airbus company is supposed to be formed by the end of 1999.</p>
