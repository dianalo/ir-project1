<p>A leader of the victorious rebel force in eastern Zaire laid out plans on Wednesday to tax and administer the area it controls and vowed to take the fight for democracy to the heart of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We will start to tax the local people so that the schools work, markets are open and doctors can be paid.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment should be reduced and we have to start providing food for ourselves again,&quot; rebel military leader Andre Kassesse told a rally in Goma, close to the border with Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;Up until now the international community has only thought of the Goma region in terms of providing food and aid for refugees, but now we have to think for ourselves,&quot; he told a jubilant crowd of some 10,000 people.</p>
<p>The rebel coalition routed the Zairean army in an offensive that began in mid-October and ousted Rwandan Hutu extremists from refugee camps in the area, triggering the return of half a million Hutu refugees back home to Rwanda.</p>
<p>The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) includes Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis from the east and Zaireans from other regions.</p>
<p>The ADFL is headed by a veteran Zairean rebel, Laurent Kabila, who is not a Tutsi. Kassesse is his military commander.</p>
<p>Kabila was expected to address the rally but was absent.</p>
<p>&quot;Kabila can't be with us today, he's got other things to do and he's too busy,&quot; Kassesse said.</p>
<p>He was flanked by rebel bodyguards, one armed with a fly-whisk and Chinese hand-grenade, another sporting a large fur hat in defiance of the sun beating down on the crowd.</p>
<p>Many of the soldiers in the disparate rebel force shun standard military fatigues, preferring incongruous brightly-coloured shirts and Wellington rubber boots.</p>
<p>Kassesse said his troops would bring democracy to the whole of Zaire and oust President Mobutu Sese Seko, in power since 1965 but now recovering in France from cancer surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu has done nothing for us so we have decided to initiate an armed struggle to have democracy in Zaire. Our troops will move into the rest of Zaire to facilitate democracy and if (Zairean soldiers) return to this area we will fight them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ADFL has carefully not announced any secession plans which would bring into inevitable collision with African leaders who oppose changes to borders inherited from colonialism.</p>
<p>The crowd was ecstatic, waving banners with slogans like: &quot;No to France's presence in Zaire because of their protection of Mobutu&quot; and &quot;No to dictatorship and neo-colonialism. Yes to democracy&quot;.</p>
<p>France has the leading advocate of an armed intervention force in Zaire to help the Hutu refugees.</p>
<p>Kassesse called on local people to join the rebel forces and form self-defence committees in the countryside to defend themselves from Zairean soldiers.</p>
<p>Zaire suspended outspoken army chief of staff General Eluki Monga on Wednesday for saying a multinational force was no longer needed in Zaire.</p>
<p>General Eluki had previously blamed the government for the army's pitiful showing against the rebels, saying it was starved of money to pay and equip troops.</p>
<p>Kassesse told the Goma crowd they should use the natural resources of Zaire such as diamonds, minerals and agricultural products to put in place a structured, self-supporting economy.</p>
