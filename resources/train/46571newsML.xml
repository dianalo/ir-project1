<title>USA: CME October live cattle close up on strong cash.</title>
<headline>CME October live cattle close up on strong cash.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A firming tone in cash cattle markets kept October CME live cattle futures higher at the close after values in that pit set a new contract high early, traders said. However, back months slipped.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures rose on lower corn futures, traders said.</p>
<p>October and December live cattle posted new contract highs early with October at 72.950 cents a lb and December at 68.800 cents before slipping. Prices finished 0.400 cent higher to 0.200 lower with only October up at 72.725 cents and bull spreading brought on by declining corn futures prices weighing on deferred months.</p>
<p>Increased feedlot movement at $71 per cwt sparked further commercial demand in live cattle futures early with fund buying and some buy stops adding to gains before profit taking developed, traders said.</p>
<p>Heavyweight choice boxed beef values have risen nearly $4.50 per cwt since the beginning of the month to $105.87 per cwt Wednesday, the highest level since December 1. This has kept packer demand for cash cattle strong and cattle values have recently risen to highest levels since April, 1995.  </p>
<p>Feedlots adopted a firm pricing stance this week as their showlists declined due to light placements earlier in the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Showlists continue to decline and marketings continue to exceed placements, to a comparable time period&quot; last year, said Dale Benson, Vice President and Senior livstock analyst for Dean Witter.</p>
<p>R.J. O'Brien, E.D.&amp; F. Man, Refco, Lind-Waldock and Cargill Investor Services were key buyers, traders said. Rosenthal Collins spread long December/short October and Refco bought February and sold December, sources said.</p>
<p>In live cattle options, commercials did risk reversals in December and Febuary and there was some in-the-money October 67 and 68 call buying, pit sources added.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures were bolstered from the start by a USDA crop report released early Wednesday, which showed greater corn and wheat supplies this year than earlier expected. Rising fed cattle prices also lent support and offset a slight setback in the CME feeder cattle index.</p>
<p>The latest CME index was off $0.06 at $63.98 per cwt.</p>
<p>Active November particularly firmed by rolling of long positions to Nov from Sep by E.D.&amp; F. Man, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle closed 0.175 to 0.450 cent a lb higher with October up 0.450 at 64.325 cents per lb.</p>
