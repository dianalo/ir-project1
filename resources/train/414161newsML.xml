<headline>Weak Wall St damps Eurobourses, dollar firms.</headline>

<p>Another poor start on Wall Street on Monday following three consecutive declines last week damped already nervous European share trading and the main bourses all closed down.</p>
<p>On currency markets the dollar was firm and near its session peaks at the European close, buoyed by stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer spending figures -- adding to speculation that U.S. rates may soon rise.</p>
<p>The London stock exchange, which had been weaker earlier in the day, closed only slightly off after the market made a late recovery, inspired by the Dow bouncing back from an almost 50 point deficit in early New York trade to be just four points down when European business ended.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index ended just 1.2 points down at 4,307.1, its highest point of the day after dropping as low as 4,287.3 in early trade.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done remarkably well considering the state of Wall Street,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;The Dow has come off more than 150 points in the last few days and we have been coping well.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said more money was expected this month from private investors, ahead of the April deadline for investing in Personal Equity Plans (PEPs), a tax-efficient method of share ownership in Britain.</p>
<p>One big faller was NatWest Bank , which lost 28 pence to 730.5 as the stock went ex-dividend and investors reacted to news on Friday that it had lost 50 million pounds ($81 million) on options trading.</p>
<p>Political worries ahead of a British election, due by late May, also unsettled investor sentiment, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;After last week's by-election (which the ruling Conservative Party lost by a big margin) people are starting to focus on the fact of a change of government,&quot; the head of trading at a major investment bank said.</p>
<p>Paris also closed with moderate losses, lacking domestic momentum and taking its direction from softness on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The CAC index had been supported by dollar strength since the opening, but faded as investment interest waned in the afternoon, leaving it vulnerable to New York's sway. But the blue chip CAC index managed to stay above the psychological 2,600 level.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares which ended floor trading four points up before New York opened, slipped under the influence of Wall Street in later electronic trade. The DAX IBIS index, which measures screen trading, closed marginally down.</p>
<p>Dealers said  it had been an uninspired bourse session, with buying interest held back by Wall Street's poor performances towards the end of last week.</p>
<p>Markets on both sides of the Atlantic are expected to remain nervous this week, with key U.S. data and more of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony looming.</p>
<p>Greenspan concludes his testimony on Wednesday. Last week he sent stock markets sharply lower with a warning that Wall Street's recent rise had &quot;raised questions of sustainability.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said the February U.S. employment report on Friday would also keep markets on edge this week. U.S. consumer spending figures on Monday showed the strongest pickup since last October, adding to the feeling the Federal Reserve may soon hike interest rates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Athens, the Greek bourse plunged 7.45 percent, a record fall for a single day as investors sold shares across-the-board.</p>
<p>Monday's fall took investor losses over the past three sessions 1.2 trillion drachmas ($4.51 billion).</p>
<p>Stunned brokers debated whether the fall was caused by civil strife in neighbouring Albania, a capital market commission warning which many claim pulled the rug from under the market or simply valuation physics pointing to a correction.</p>
<p>A key indicator for the currency markets on Monday was the February report from the U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM). Its index rose to 53.1, stronger than consensus estimates of a rise to 52.9 percent, and up from 52.0 in January.</p>
<p>The dollar firmed from around 1.6910 marks ahead of the NAPM figure to just above 1.6930 marks after it was released. The data also gave it a boost against the yen.</p>
<p>Most of the dollar's gains against the mark held after the mark was hit in early dealings by reports of a rise in German unemployment in February. The German unit's losses were limited, however, by concerns about EMU's timetable -- EMU convergence is seen as a weakening influence on the mark.</p>
<p>Jitters about a possible delay to the start of economic and monetary union (EMU) have weakened the Italian lira and Spanish peseta over the past week and the downward pressure continued on Monday.</p>
<p>A vigorous verbal defense of the EMU timetable from a range of European officials helped calm early market jitters and the lira rallied from lows alongside speculation of central bank intervention. The Bank of Spain too was seen selling marks.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1700 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6950 marks and 121.15 yen, compared with 1.6885 and 120.88 in late European trade on Friday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS - CLOSING INDICES</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index closed down 1.2 points at 4,307.1.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 closed down 7.29 points at 2,600.26.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed up 4.22  points at 3,263.86.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
