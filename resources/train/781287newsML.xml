<p>The main union of Zimbabwe's commercial farmers urged President Robert Mugabe on Wednesday to review a controversial policy of forcibly buying land to resettle peasants, saying there was enough land available on the open market.</p>
<p>The deputy director of the 4,500-member Commercial Farmers Union (CFU), Jerry Grant, told its annual congress that the government should also tackle long-standing economic problems such as high interest rates and rising inflation which he said were severely undermining agricultural and general economic growth.</p>
<p>Grant said CFU members were &quot;distressed&quot; that the government continued to rely on a 1992 compulsory land acquisition law when it could easily buy land for its massive resettlement programme on the open market.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of the large number of properties which have changed hands in the interim, in which the minister (of agriculture and lands) has not exercised his right of first refusal, there seems absolutely no reason to compulsorily acquire properties,&quot; he said, noting that a national land acquisition committee had earmarked some 2,340 large farms for the resettlement scheme.</p>
<p>The government says it needs powers of compulsory purchase to push forward a land reform programme that would benefit Zimbabwe's majority black population rather than just a few commercial farmers from a minority white community.</p>
<p>Agriculture drives the southern African state's economy, contributing about 15 percent to its gross domestic product and with about 70 percent of the country's 12 million people living off the land.</p>
<p>Grant said the CFU felt the principle of transferring land under freehold title to state land under communal use was unsustainable and would undermine production.</p>
<p>&quot;The emphasis should be in the reverse direction with state land being suitably allocated to small-scale farmers under long-term lease of title,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mugabe has come under public criticism in the past for allowing some of his top officials, including cabinet ministers, to grab for themselves farms forcibly bought from large-scale commercial farmers for the resettlement programme.</p>
<p>The CFU's Grant said his union was also concerned that plans by the government to introduce a new one-man-one-farm regulation and a series of levies in the coming months could undermine production in the short-term.</p>
<p>Farming, he said, was already burdened by high interest rates -- which have climbed to 25 percent from 18 percent at the start of the year -- and annual inflation, which has risen to 21.4 percent from 13.9 percent last November.</p>
<p>Forecasts for agricultural output in 1998 are not yet available but there are fears the southern African region may suffer a devastating drought because of the effects of El Nino. But GDP growth is expected to edge up to five percent in 1998 from an estimated 4.5 percent forecast this year.</p>
