<p>British ship repair and conversion group Cammell Laird Holdings Plc said on Wednesday in its flotation prospectus, it planned to place 7.5 million shares at 100p per share.</p>
<p>The group said it hoped to raise four million stg from the flotation and dealings in the shares were expected to begin on July 14.  </p>
<p>Cammell said the float, which would capitalise the group at 21.2 million stg, would enhance its reputation with customers, and act as an incentive to its work force. Management and employees were able to apply for shares in the placing.</p>
<p>The group highlighted the restoration of two dry docks that are expected to significantly to boost the company's profit growth when they come on stream later in the year.</p>
<p>Cammell said pre-tax profits had grown from 175,000 stg in the year ended April 30 1995 to two million for 1997 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In reference to the current year, the group said it gained a conversion contract from Houston-based Falcon Drilling Company Inc, a leading operator of oil exploration and extraction vessels. Cammell said the Falcon contract was one of the largest ever undertaken by the group.</p>
<p>Cammell added it had also won its first military contract in the current year.</p>
