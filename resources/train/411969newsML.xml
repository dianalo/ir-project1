<p>Transport and industrial services group Brambles Industries Ltd said on Friday it expected its rate of improvement to be slower in the second half of the year to June 30, 1997 than that shown in the first half.</p>
<p>&quot;The rate of improvement at the second half is expected to be lower than that achieved in the current result because of the difficult trading conditions in Australia and Europe as well as a reduced benefit from lower net interest costs,&quot; Brambles chief executive John Fletcher said.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Brambles reported its first half net profit rose 14.3 percent to A$117.2 million. There were no abnormals.</p>
<p>Brambles also raised its dividend to 35 cents per share from 34 cents per share, but the dividend was 80 percent franked as opposed to fully franked in the previous period.</p>
<p>Fletcher said the higher profit reflected strong growth in North America and higher earnings despite difficult conditions in Australia and Europe.</p>
<p>Revenue fell A$145 million to A$1.454 billion in the half.  </p>
<p>&quot;Lower net interest resulting from the proceeds of the sale of under-performing activities in Australia and Europe, and lower interest rates, also contributed to the overall improvement,&quot; Fletcher said. Net interest expense fell to A$22.3 million from A$32.3 million in the half.</p>
<p>Brambles' Australian operations continued to perform sluggishly overall, &quot;with little evidence of an improvement in those areas of the economy in which the company operates.&quot;  </p>
<p>Subdued economic conditions in Continental Europe continued to affect growth from Brambles' European activites, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;But this was offset by the good gains achieved by the CHEP (pallet hire) and Cleanaway joint ventures,&quot; Brambles said.</p>
<p>Brambles' CHEP joint venture is with Britain's GKN Plc.</p>
<p>Brambles said it experienced pleasing profit growth from its U.S. activities.</p>
<p>Fletcher said that while economic conditions were not expected to improve materially in the second half, both regions should continue to perform solidly.  </p>
<p>Total European earnings before interest and tax rose 11.2 percent to A$112.8 million, while U.S. earnings rose to A$26.2 million from A$17.8 million in the comparable period a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Further strong profit gains were expected in North America,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile in Asia, earnings were lower because of the completion of a hazardous waste disposal contract with Taiwan Power. EBIT from other regions, which includes Asia, fell to A$1.5 million for the half from A$2.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;While Asian opportunities look increasingly promising, it will be some time before the region contributes significant profits to the group's result,&quot; Brambles sid.</p>
<p>Brambles shares closed unchanged at A$21.70, having earlier risen to an intra-day high of A$21.94.</p>
