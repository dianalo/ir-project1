<p>Members in the lower house of parliament came close to exchanging blows following heated arguments over the Patna High Court's remarks that Bihar state was fit for imposing president's rule.

<p>ATUL CHOKSEY CALLS OFF ASIAN PAINTS DEAL</p>
<p>Atul Choksey, a managing director of the Asian Paints, cancelled the sale of eight percent stake held by him and his family in the company. The reason for his change of mind is not known. But it is believed that Choksey did not want to put DSP Merrill Lynch in a corner. DSP Merrill Lynch may compensate Choksey for the loss of market capitalisation following the disclosure on August 2 of the deal between him and the foreign institutional buyers, Capital International and Morgan Stanley. Since the disclosure, Asian Paints' share price has slumped to 310 rupees from 375.</p>

<p>FUNDING OF BUYBACK FROM PRIOR ISSUE PROCEEDS ALLOWED</p>
<p>The final version of the new companies bill cleared by the cabinet last week allows the buy-back of shares to be funded from the proceeds of a prior issue. The Dhanuka committee had recommended that this mode of funding should not be allowed. After considering the committee's recommendation, the Department of Company Affairs has introduced safeguards in the bill while allowing the funding of buy-back of shares in this manner. The final version of the bill has also raised the retirement age for full-time directors to 70 years from the recommended 65 years and to 75 years for part-time directors from the recommended 70 years.</p>

<p>BOURSE INDICATOR FALLS BY ANOTHER 55 POINTS</p>
<p>The Bombay bourse index fell by 54.90 points to 4,370.13. Brokers attributed the 40 percent fall in the turnover to 7,949.9 million rupees to the bourse regulator's decision to postpone discussions on the modified carry-forward system by three more weeks. Pharmaceutical stocks took a severe beating on news of a 30 percent cut in drug prices.</p>

<p>INDECISION BY BOURSE REGULATOR UNLIKELY TO AFFECT MARKET</p>
<p>The stock markets are likely to overcome their disappointment after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) failed to decide on an easier carry-forward trading system, brokers and analysts said. Stock markets, which went through a roller coaster ride on Tuesday amid speculation over the SEBI's decision, will probably shrug off the disappointment and focus on other factors, dealers said. SEBI was expected to liberalise a strict carry-forward trading system and help ease restrictions on transactions and increase the funding limit.</p>

<p>TELECOM FIRMS MAY BE ALLOWED TO CHANGE HANDS</p>
<p>The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is considering a request by a few Indian companies that they be allowed to change their overseas joint venture partners before the end of the three year lock-in period. Telecom sources are hopeful that the DoT will concede their demand. They argue that the three-year lock-in period was envisaged when the licence conditions were initially drafted in 1994/95 and in principle it is now over. The companies have stepped up their lobbying after the DoT allowed domestic paging companies to change their overseas partners. A few Indian promoters now argue that the purpose for which the overseas companies were roped in had been served and they should now be allowed to change partners.</p>

<p>POLYSINDO TO INVEST A BILLION RUPEE IN INDIAN VENTURE</p>
<p>Indonesian major Polysindo said it would invest one billion rupees in Best and Crompton Engineering in the next two years to modernise its operations and diversify into power and auto ancillary sectors. Polysindo is about to take over the Indian company. M. Arunachalam, who is director of Polysindo, said the company was talking to a number of European companies for technology support to manufacture power equipment and auto components.</p>

<p>PENGUIN TO PICK UP 55 PCT IN INDIAN ARM</p>
<p>The government allowed British publisher Penguin to raise its stake in Penguin India to 55 percent from 40 percent, paving the way for the Indian company to pass into foreign hands. It also allowed Penguin India to bring in fresh funds worth 15 million rupees in the form of optionally (unsecured) convertible debentures. Penguin will bring in 8.25 million rupees while Penguin India's main promoter Ananda Publishers will pump in the remaining 6.75 million rupees. The shareholding of Ananda Publishers will now drop to 45 percent.</p>

<p>CONTAINER CORPORATION TOLD TO AUCTION DAEWOO KITS</p>
<p>The Customs Department asked the Container Corporation to auction 50 of the 640 containers of auto kits imported by Daewoo Motor India for its Cielo cars as a warning to the company. The decision follows Daewoo's failure to take delivery of the containers lying with the Container Corporation's ICD terminal at Tughlaqabad for over a year. Both the Container Corporation and the Customs Department were repeatedly asking Daewoo Motors to clear the consignment of completely knocked down and semi-knocked down auto kits. Daewoo had to pay about 300 million rupees towards customs charge besides demurrage charges to the Container Corporation at the rate of 60 rupees a day per container if it wanted to take delivery of the consignment.</p>

<p>RULING FRONT DEFERS DECISION ON PETRO GOODS PRICE HIKE</p>
<p>The ruling United Front's Steering Committee deferred a decision on the oil and petro products price revision due to differences among the coalition partners. S. Jaipal Reddy, who is spokesman of the Front and the Minister of Information and Broadcasting, said the committee felt the decision on petro goods price hike could not be put off for too long and a decision would be taken soon. He said the plan to float oil bonds to stem the oil pool deficit did not figure in the discussions.</p>
