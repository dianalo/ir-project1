<p>Negotiations between American Airlines and its pilots union continued into the early hours of Friday, with neither side reporting any breakthrough that would avert a midnight strike at the nation's number-two carrier.</p>
<p>A federal mediator refereeing the talks at a downtown hotel informed the pilots that American had rejected a key union contract proposal covering who should pilot -- and at what pay -- the carrier's smaller American Eagle planes.</p>
<p>Mediators are shuttling back and forth between the two sides offering hypothetical &quot;what if&quot; proposals on a variety of issues in an effort the bring the two sides closer together and prevent a midnight Friday (0500 GMT Saturday) strike by the pilots which would throw the nation's air transport system into turmoil.</p>
<p>&quot;They're going to work all night, throughout the night. All day (Friday),&quot; said Dave Bates, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,000 pilots.</p>
<p>He said the union is &quot;disappointed at the lack of progress&quot; so far.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to negotiate for as long as it takes. But (Friday) night at midnight the pilots will be on strike.&quot;</p>
<p>Bates said no face-to-face talks had as yet been scheduled. An American spokesman would only say that the negotiations were continuing.</p>
<p>Going into the talks on Thursday evening, Kenneth Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said he was hopeful an agreement could be worked out in time to avert a strike.</p>
<p>The union had proposed that its pilots fly the American Eagle flights, but with lower pay than pilots flying the regular American aircraft. American, however, wants to continue using lower-paid commuter pilots from a different union to fly the smaller planes.</p>
<p>While the mediator has informed the union of the airline's rejection of the proposal on small planes, union official said the company itself has not notified them directly of that.</p>
<p>The dispute also centers around the pilots' pay. They now earn an average of about $120,000 a year.</p>
<p>The union earlier had said it would offer a new pay proposal -- probably less than the 11.5 percent over four years it had sought. The latest reported offer from American was a six percent boost over four years.</p>
<p>A strike would ground 2,200 American flights on Saturday and affect about 200,000 passengers. American, a unit of AMR Corp., accounts for about 20 percent of the nation's airline capacity.</p>
<p>The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is trying to rebook passengers on other carriers and has already canceled nearly all international flights scheduled for Friday night.</p>
<p>American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said on Thursday the carrier was canceling 12 of its domestic flights scheduled for Friday. &quot;There are some small domestic airports where we have no permanent place to park the planes if there is a strike, so we decided to cancel those 12 flights.&quot;</p>
<p>A Transportation Department official said a strike could cost the U.S. economy up to $200 million a day.</p>
<p>American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall called for binding government arbitration of the dispute, a proposal the pilots have repeatedly rejected.</p>
<p>&quot;I think mandatory binding arbitration should be required&quot; to prevent airline strikes, Crandall told a congressional subcommittee. Binding arbitration would mean both parties agreed to abide by the decision of an arbitrator.</p>
<p>&quot;I seriously doubt we could accept that,&quot; union spokesman Wally Pitts said.</p>
<p>Crandall told a hearing of a House of Representatives Transportation subcommittee he was unsure if a strike could be avoided. &quot;We have two choices: we can either cave in or take a strike. A strike of 90 days will destroy this airline.&quot;</p>
<p>As the talks entered their fourth day of intensive bargaining, President Bill Clinton was keeping a close watch.</p>
<p>Clinton could intervene and name an emergency board to try to resolve the issues. Under the Railway Labor Act, which also covers airlines, the president has the power to declare a national emergency to stop a strike and to keep planes flying for 60 days. The last time such an action was taken in an airlines strike was in 1966.</p>
<p>But at an unrelated news conference on Thursday, Clinton repeated that the parties should use the government mediator to reach an agreement.</p>
