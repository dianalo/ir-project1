<p>Business activity in the ex-UK air cargo market to Asia, Australasia and the Middle East has slackened in the past two weeks in the face of over capacity, a Reuters survey shows.</p>
<p>Demand for air freight also dipped on a combination of factors. As a result, some rates eased leaving carriers blaming capacity increases amongst their competitors as the key factor that forced the market lower and caused some discounting.</p>
<p>But some forwarders said this spot rating that had followed the introduction of new carriers' services on certain routes had abated slightly.</p>
<p>Many forwarders and carriers indicated that their own rates were little altered although claimed others were offering lower quotes.</p>
<p>Many in the industry are still balancing the net impact on rates of the removal of fuel surcharges last month with many early-April rate increases.</p>
<p>The jury is still out on the next move in pricing but unless demand increases to help fill capacity, several warn that yields could be vulnerable to a downturn --especially as jet fuel prices have dipped further.</p>
<p>Interesting recent cargo shipments included two Rolls -Royce motor cars, bound for Japan and Australia, which Cathay Pacific carried.</p>
<p>Other airlines which turned down the contracts said the extra time involved in ensuring such valuable cargo travelled without a scratch cut into the reward factor.</p>
<p>Most carriers said shipments being flown to Asia and Australasia were mainly of a fairly general nature, with electronics continuing as an important cargo.</p>
<p>Later this month, more horses are scheduled to be flown to Japan, said Tony Edwards, Japan Airlines' cargo sales manager for the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>Major carriers operating to Japan and Korea maintained they were able to fly with additional summer capacity without having to cut rates but claimed that airlines not flying on a 'home' route were most aggressive in chasing cargo.</p>
<p>This extra competition reflected a combination of increased capacity and curtailed demand.</p>
<p>The latter was a result of the mix of Japan's Golden Week holiday, the April 1 increase in Japan's consumption tax to five from three percent, which had bunched imports into March, seasonal usual import hesitancy at the start of the fiscal year and China's recent imposition of an import tax.</p>
<p>All Nippon Airways' assistant UK cargo sales manager John O'Shea said the higher Japan tax had dampened consumer spending in the country.</p>
<p>Additionally, the start of the 1997-98 fiscal year had brought a lull to corporate demand after the usual rush of business in March when importers traditionally spend uncommitted money in their 1996-97 budgets.</p>
<p>The recent strength of sterling against other currencies had also dampened the ex-UK market but carriers and forwarders always underline the fact that reaction to currency movements is not an overnight affair.</p>
<p>Extra capacity to Asia/Australasia/Middle East has come from a variety of carriers, such as Polar Air Cargo, Air China, British Airways, Emirates and Qatar Airways, either in the form of additional flights or by means of planes with larger capacity.</p>
<p>Although BA has not formally confirmed it is continuing long-standing special price offers for pallets onto May, its competitors on main ex-UK global routes said the British carrier is still heavily discounting its published tariff.</p>
<p>Some airline newcomers to routes have cut rates to attract business but Simon Allsup of GSA Air Cargo Partners, which acts for Polar, said this was no longer necessary.</p>
<p>Another sign of surplus capacity came from Taiwan carrier Eva Air, whose new UK sales representative Peter Dawson said Eva was reassessing its total European market strategy having last month first increasing rates before dropping its fuel surcharge. This pattern was followed by many airlines.</p>
<p>Dawson said EVA had being flying full to capacity ex-London, from where further shipments of vaccine have been flown to Taipei to help fight a recent outbreak of swine fever.</p>
<p>The last batch was due to fly Friday (May 2). Its flights from Amsterdam have been carrying more general cargo loads, Dawson added.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong on Thursday, industry sources said Air China was offering reduced rates to try and win market share on its new London route.</p>
<p>Air China operates weekly passenger 747 flights and weekly 747 Combi flights to both Hong Kong and Beijing giving ex-UK freight capacity of some 100 tonnes.</p>
<p>Air New Zealand's UK-New Zealand market has shrunk slightly during the first four months of 1997 compared with the same period last year, said its Europe cargo sales manager Phil Rawlings.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason is that the strength of the NZ dollar has made exports, particularly of meat produce, more expensive for buyers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, exports have declined which, in turn, has reduced the amount of foreign currency reserves New Zealand has available to spend on imports. The New Zealand market is controlled by the amount of money they have to spend, and this is less than a year ago,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Rawlings said that certain Far Eastern airlines were providing ANZ, the only carrier operating directly on the London-Auckland route, with stiff rate competition with their transhipment services.</p>
<p>&quot;But apart from our direct services, the other advantages we offer over the competition are a strong domestic New Zealand network plus Pacific connections to high-yield destinations such as Papeete and Fiji,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>London-Auckland tariffs, added to the Reuters table of indicative rates, range from around 2.00 stg at the bottom level to above 3.00 stg, with an average market rate of 2.55 stg per kg for 100 kg shipments. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017</p>
