<p>Albania's parliament on Friday passed a new electoral law that was expected to pave the way for vital elections planned for the end of June, politicians said.</p>
<p>The elections are a key part of international efforts to restore stability to Albania and were agreed as part of a package of measures to stem widespread unrest which flared earlier this year after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes.  </p>
<p>The passing of the new law followed an emergency visit by European envoy Franz Vranitzky, who persuaded politicians to revise previous legislation after most political parties threatened to boycott the vote.</p>
<p>These parties said the earlier law favoured President Sali Berisha's former ruling Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Democratic Party chairman Tritan Shehu said the new law had been passed and was expected to please most parties as it incorporated Vranitzky's recommendations. The elections were expected to take place as planned at the end of June, he added.</p>
<p>Members of the Socialist Party, which together with other parties in the government of national unity had threatened to boycott the vote, were not available for comment.</p>
