<p>An Italian-led force due to safeguard aid to anarchic Albania faces risks from banditry, resentment over the sinking of a refugee ship and growing fractiousness in the Balkan state's coalition government.</p>
<p>The U.N.-approved force, expected to number about 2,500 troops or police, is expected to arrive in coming days to protect food and medical supplies to Albania, facing its worst crisis since the collapse of communism in 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many problems with such an operation,&quot; said Jan de Marchant et d'Ansembourg, heading a European Union mission to Albania to define aid and security needs.</p>
<p>But he told Reuters he believed the force had wide public support in Albania, noting that all parties in the coalition appointed on March 11 to solve the lawlessness and prepare June elections backed its deployment.</p>
<p>Any armed opposition is likely to be from lawless gangs. Hundreds of thousands of weapons are in people's hands after the looting of arsenals amid an insurrection in mid-March triggered by the collapse of savings schemes.</p>
<p>Scores of people have died, many of them in accidental shootings or drunken rows. In the most violent incident, 20 people died in a shootout. In one assault on an arsenal, attackers used children as a human shield.</p>
<p>Few seem to have heeded government calls to hand back guns. One grim joke tells of an Albanian who, in a fit of civic-mindedness, drove to a collection point in a stolen tank to hand in a looted assault rifle. He kept the tank.</p>
<p>D'Ansembourg said his mission was not recommending paying people as a way of encouraging people to hand in weapons, reckoning it would not work. &quot;It would be up to the Albanian authorities to consider that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>News of the force's imminent arrival has been overshadowed by the sinking of a refugee boat in the Adriatic on Friday after a collision with an Italian corvette, enforcing a ban on refugees after an exodus of some 13,000 this month.</p>
<p>Tirana says that 79 people died and has angrily demanded an explanation over the sinking, while insisting that it will not affect the force's deployment. Albanian politicians and many people have reacted with outrage.</p>
<p>Many of those missing were from the southern region around Vlore, the port from where the ill-fated Russian-built ship left. Vlore is one of two ports that foreign forces are due to secure to supply aid.</p>
<p>Four people are known to have died in Friday's shipwreck and 34 people survived.</p>
<p>Adding to the tangle are signs of growing tensions in the coalition government. Some leaders of parties in the coalition met in Vlore on Friday and demanded the resignation of right-wing President Sali Berisha.</p>
<p>Diplomats said that any collapse of the coalition before the planned June elections could leave foreign forces in a political limbo, forcing them to tread a thin line to avoid becoming identified with Berisha or opposition parties.</p>
<p>Italy reckons that 2,500 personnel will take part in the security force, with a similar number in reserve. Other countries expected to participate are Greece, France, Spain, Portugal and perhaps Turkey and Romania.</p>
<p>Relief workers are also cautioning that Albania's fragile distribution system for food and medicines could be wrecked if foreign nations do too much and swamp Albania with aid.</p>
<p>The Red Cross is also uneasy about armed guards.</p>
<p>The Red Cross estimates that about 10 percent of the population could be threatened by hunger. The EU reckons Albania urgently needs 10,000 of flour and $10 million in medical supplies.</p>
<p>The multinational force is due to secure the ports of Durres and Vlore and the international airport at Tirana as staging points for distributing aid in the current lawlessness.</p>
<p>But d'Ansembourg said his group had discovered there were no storage depots at Vlore -- meaning that the force would both have to guard the port and a route to warehouses inland.</p>
<p>&quot;They may face problems securing the road,&quot; he said.</p>
