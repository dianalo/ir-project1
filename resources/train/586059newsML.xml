<p>Chile may report inflation this year of less than the official target of 5.5 percent with the Central Bank likely to cut interest rates faster than expected, said economist Juan Andres Fontaine.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation scenario has improved significantly and the goal of 5.5 percent, which had seemed difficult to meet, today seems as if it might even be beaten,&quot; Fontaine, a well-known local economist, told a financial seminar.</p>
<p>Inflation fell sharply to 6.1 percent in the 12 months to April from 8.4 percent in the year to April 1996.  </p>
<p>The slowdown may give the Central Bank room to cut interest rates further than analysts have been anticipating.</p>
<p>&quot;My impression is that the panorama has improved sufficiently to think that we are in clearly on the path of lower interest rates,&quot; said Fontaine.</p>
<p>The interbank interest rate, currently seven percent, may end the year below the 6.5 percent level forecast by the market, he added.</p>
<p>The bank jacked up rates over a year ago to control Chile's robust economic growth which was threatening to fuel inflation.</p>
