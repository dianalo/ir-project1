<p>Saga Petroleum ASA said on Thursday increased hydrocarbon production and a rise in oil prices in crown terms lifted operating profits in the first four months of the year by 60 percent compared with the same 1996 period.</p>
<p>Norway's largest listed oil company booked an operating result of 1.38 billion crowns ($195.1 million) and pre-tax profits of 303 million crowns.</p>
<p>The corresponding year-ago figures of 860 million crowns and 894 million crowns respectively do not include any earnings from British exploration group Santa Fe, which Saga formally acquired in December.</p>
<p>Saga attributed a plunge in net profits in the four months to 109 million crowns against 405 million crowns to a 1.024 billion charge due to the appreciation of the dollar. Net financial items showed a negative result of 1.077 billion crowns compared with a 34 million crown profit a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of a higher crown value of the company's debt in U.S. dollars following the crown/USD exchange rate increase from 6.44 to 7.11 during the period, 1.024 billion crowns was charged to financial items,&quot; Saga said.</p>
<p>Ashbjoern Larsen, Saga's President and CEO, said the group was in a positive period of strong growth.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good result. The results were negatively affected by a paper loss of approximately one billion crowns on the company's dollar debt. There can be no doubt, however, that the company is served by a high U.S. dollar exchange rate,&quot; Larsen said in the statement.</p>
<p>Saga's A share on the Oslo bourse dipped a few crowns after the open but recovered to stand 1.50 crowns, or 1.05 percent, down at 141 crowns at 1215 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The results were as we expected, maybe slightly lower but there were a lot of uncertainties over the new U.K. operations,&quot; said an Oslo-based analyst.</p>
<p>Others were more positive to the group's performance.</p>
<p>&quot;People shouldn't get bogged down in the currency loss, it's a paper loss which will not crystallise if Saga repays its debt in crowns. The underlying performance is pretty good,&quot; said Ian Reid, oil exploration analyst at NatWest Securities in London.</p>
<p>&quot;In crown terms net income has gone up quite sharply and cashflow is rising. The share has gone up some eight percent since the beginning of April. The market is slowly waking up to the fact that this company is doing extremely well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Saga said a 53 percent growth in production came primarily from its new activities on the British continental shelf following the Santa Fe buyout.</p>
<p>Group production of oil, natural gas liquids and gas in the four months averaged 25 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) compared with 16.3 million boe a year-ago. The figure included an average 46,700 barrels per day from British waters.</p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition of Santa Fe, now Saga Petroleum UK, has so far lived up to expectations, and the company's production during the period is somewhat higher then expected,&quot; Saga said.</p>
<p>The company said it would begin drilling a new well on the Kristin discovery in June to obtain a more reliable estimate for reserves at the field.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Saga said it had confirmed that the Kristin gas and condensate find off mid-Norway held reserves of at least 700 million boe, making it one of the largest discoveries in Norwegian waters in 10 years.</p>
<p>Kristin is believed to be bigger than the nearby Lavrans prospect -- also operated by Saga -- which holds around 650 million boe.</p>
<p>&quot;From what we have seen so far it is a very positive result for Saga and the main event in the first tertial,&quot; Andes Utne, Saga's executive vice president, said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television. &quot;They are sizeable discoveries but it remains to delineate these discoveries, which will be done further on during 1997 and 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>Utne said development of Kristin would depend upon gas sales allocations by the Norwegian authorities, but the company was aiming for a start up in 2001.</p>
<p>NatWest's Reid said Kristin and Lavrans would be a &quot;major step forward&quot; for the company.</p>
<p>&quot;Saga has had incredible exploration success and can be considered as the most successful explorer in the North Sea over the last few years,&quot; he said.</p>
