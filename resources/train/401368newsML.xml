<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX electricity futures were mixed in a quiet session ahead of the March contract expiry today, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;These contracts may just go out with a whimper,&quot; a New York futures trader said.</p>
<p>As of 1240 EST, March California Oregon Border (COB) was down seven cents at $10.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), traded $10.40 to $10.75, while April held steady at $9.95, traded from $9.90 to $10.00 per MWh.</p>
<p>June COB was down 10 cents at $10.70 per MWh.</p>
<p>March Palo Verde (PV) was up 12 cents at $14.55 after exchanges in a range of $14.30 to $14.70, while April PV was up five cents at $13.05, traded $13.00 to $13.15 per MWh.</p>
<p>June PV was down five cents at $15.60 per MWh.</p>
<p>Little news was seen affecting the electricity contracts, although underlying downward pressure was seen from expectations of much above-normal spring runoff predicted to boost hydroelectric production in the U.S. West.</p>
<p>Some support for power was also seen from outages at the 1,221 megawatt (MW) Palo Verde nuclear unit 3 and a 750 MW Navajo coal-fired unit, both in Arizona.</p>
<p>Also, the 1,070 MW San Onofre nuclear power unit 2 in southern California was expected to return to service March 7 from a scheduled maintenance and refueling outage which began earlier this month.</p>
<p>The March PV and COB contracts expire today.</p>
<p>NYMEX said that as of 1220 EST, an estimated 80 COB and 86 PV contracts changed hands.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, temperatures were expected to be about three degrees Fahrenheit below normal in the north to nine degrees below normal in the southeast through much of the week. Some precipitation was seen likely towards the middle of the week.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, temperatures were expected to be two degrees below normal on the coast and five degrees below normal in the east-central areas through much of the week, with some precipitation likely, especially in the south and east.</p>
<p>COB open interest for Feb 24 fell 74 to 3,528, while PV open interest rose 29 to 2,045, NYMEX said.</p>
