<p>Bosnian Serbs are violating a regional arms control pact and possess more weapons than they should, a senior Western arms negotiator said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Norwegian general Vigleik Eide of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) told a news conference there were serious discrepancies in Bosnian Serbs arms calculations which needed corrected.</p>
<p>The arms deal was agreed in Florence on June 16 after six months of negotiations in Vienna mediated by the OSCE.</p>
<p>&quot;Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serbs) have made a number of exceptions in their reduction liability, by referring to article 3,&quot; Eide said.</p>
<p>The arms pact limits the weapons each signatory can hold, but an exclusion clause, article 3, provides exceptions for weapons in manufacture, research, museums, arms awaiting disposal and arms destined for export.</p>
<p>&quot;I have problems seeing these exceptions being according to the agreement, be it letter or spirit,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The other parties were not making use of the clause and did not accept the interpretation of the Bosnian Serbs, Eide said.</p>
<p>The deal was signed after intense wrangling by the Bosnian Serbs, the Moslem-Croat Federation, Croatia and rump Yugoslavia. It is part of the Dayton peace package which ended over four years of war in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;We also have serious differences between the reported number from the Republika Srpska in the data exchange, especially in the artillery pieces, and the real holdings as analysed by experts of those countries who are witnesses to the agreement,&quot; Eide noted.</p>
<p>The United States said last week that the Bosnian Serbs had &quot;exempted hundreds of pieces of equipment through abuse of the counting rules and they have declared a reduction liability that in fact entails very few reductions on their part&quot;.</p>
<p>Eide would not comment on the number or specific category of weapons the Serbs were trying to retain.</p>
<p>But an OSCE official said last week he believed the Serbs were trying to keep around 200 tanks, claiming they were for export.</p>
<p>The other parties to the pact were complying with their reduction quotas, Eide said. The OSCE had carried out over 70 inspections of the weapons held by all parties since August.</p>
<p>Croatia and Yugoslavia had already cut their arsenals by several hundred weapons.</p>
<p>Eide said the differences with the Bosnian Serbs would have to be resolved, but the fact one party was breaching the pact did not mean the pact would collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement is such that even if there is one party not carrying out its full obligations, there is no reason for the others not to comply with their own,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the OSCE had a limited role in pressuring parties breaching the pact, he noted.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to find ways forward, but the real influence I think will have to come from those countries who witnessed the agreement,&quot; he said.</p>
