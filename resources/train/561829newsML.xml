<p>United Capital Corp said on Tuesday its higher Q1 earnings resulted from real estate operations, and from a turnaround in its antenna systems group.</p>
<p>Earlier the company reported net income for the quarter $2.635 million, or $0.50 per share, versus $946,000, or $017 per share, during the comparable period in 1996.</p>
<p>The company said that gains on the sale of real estate assets, lower depreciation expense associated with properties sold and the timing of certain operating expenses produced an increased pretax income for the real estate operation of about $2.7 million from the comparable 1996 period.</p>
<p>The company said revenues for the antenna systems group increased 13 percent from the prior year  moving into the black as the group reported an operating profit of about $160,000 versus a loss of $427,000 in the prior year.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said this change came from a move towards increase efficiency in its manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>The company said, however, that its engineered products segment posted disappointing results as revenues and operating profit decreased about 13 percent and 20 percent, respectively from last year's record revenues and operating profits.</p>
<p>The company said these revenue reductions are due to continued price competition and declining worldwide automotive sales.</p>
<p>The company said that in response to these reductions, it is pursuing new sales opportunities and is continuing its emphasis on cost reductions.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said United is looking at opportunities in new international markets and product markets. He declined to be more specific.</p>
