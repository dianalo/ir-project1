<p>Sun Microsystems Inc, aiming to grab market share from its rivals, said it will on Tuesday introduce a six-month program of competitive upgrades for customers of rival server and storage products.</p>
<p>Carl Stolle, director of server marketing at the workstation maker, told Reuters the program specifically targets customers who exchange Hewlett-Packard Co HP T500 series and International Business Corp IBM SP2 servers and EMC Corp disk arrays for Sun systems.  </p>
<p>Sun Microsystems is seeking to take advantage of the competitive strength of its current product line, with bookings of orders for its server products more than doubling in its fourth fiscal quarter to June 30 following the April introduction of its new high-end Ultra models, Stolle said.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been in the server business for more than a decade and I've never enjoyed such a strong competitve advantage vis a vis our competition,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;We want not only to win new business, but to unplug H-P and IBM gear.&quot;  </p>
<p>The six-month promotion targets top-of-the-line Hewlett-Packard and IBM servers, he added.</p>
<p>The program contains four components which the company said offers &quot;aggressive&quot; cost savings along with integration and support for installing Sun computing technology:</p>
<p>-- A trade-in program providing up to 40 percent credit on Sun products when trading in HP T500, IBM SP2 and EMC disk arrays.</p>
<p>-- Major discounts on migration services for customers moving from the HP-UX and IBM AIX Unix operating systems to the Solaris environment.  </p>
<p>-- A 25 percent discount on Sun's data center assessment service, which uses distributed computing management tools and practices to evaluate a customer's data center.</p>
<p>-- Up to 50 percent discount on system support services.</p>
<p>John Shoemaker, vice president and general manager of Sun's Enterprise Server and Storage Group, said &quot;since the introduction of the Ultra Enterprise servers and new SPARCstorage array products, customers who in the past have purchased from HP, IBM and EMC are now rushing to buy our systems.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said that the new product lines currently being rolled out by HP and IBM &quot;fail to offer a seamless upgrade path or long-term growth potential.&quot;</p>
<p>Sun officials said the company's new array storage systems outperform those of EMC, which they said were designed for mainframe systems, by two to nine times in the distributed computing environment that is now popular.</p>
<p>Sun is also offering discounts on lease terms for customers obtaining its products.</p>
<p>Shares of Sun Microsystems closed down 7/8 on Thursday at 55-1/2.</p>
