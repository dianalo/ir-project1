<p>COMEX copper futures ended slightly higher Monday, but volumes were light and trade featureless, traders said.</p>
<p>COMEX July copper ended up 0.40 cent at 117.55 cents a pound, after trading a 116.60-118.00 cent range.</p>
<p>The July/September spread was little changed around 3.20 cents, while in London the LME cash-to-three month spread was marginally firmer around $68.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>Last week copper prices corrected down from the 12-month highs seen in May, as funds took profits on the long rally.</p>
<p>&quot;There is little sign that the group of three or four big banks and merchants and their associates, who own or control the bulk of the LME's copper stocks, are anything but bullish,&quot; Merrill Lynch analyst Ted Arnold said.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumption growth rates are too strong in both China and the West to allow a sufficiently large enough surplus to build up that would push prices down to 85 cents a pound ($1,874 a tonne),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Shangai copper prices remain below LME levels and there is little sign yet of Chinese buying this year, Arnold argued.</p>
<p>But &quot;we think cash LME copper at 118 cents is very fully priced,&quot; he said. &quot;This could well be the seasonal high point for copper prices.&quot;</p>
<p>Funds remain heavily net long copper, according to the latest CFTC Commitment of Traders data late Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-commercials&quot; were net long 19,334 contracts as of June 3rd.</p>
