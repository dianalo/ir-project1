<p>The dollar ended easier against a robust yen in Europe as the market's fixation on the rising Japanese balance of payments surplus fuelled brisk demand for the Japanese unit ahead of the latest trade data.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen continued to probe key supports about 111.90 and mark/yen skidded to its lowest level in almost two years at 63.99. Traders are awaiting the release at 2350 GMT of Japanese current account data for May. Analysts expect a rise in the surplus to 961.7 billion yen from 355.7 billion yen previously.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark, meantime, was buoyed by a limp mark and the latest rise in sterling to a new six-year high at 2.9740 marks.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market's going into this Japanese trade number short of dollar/yen and mark/yen and trawling for stop losses,&quot; said Nick Parsons, strategist at Banque Paribas. &quot;I think they will be disappointed though and I have a feeling the Japanese officials will be successful protecting these technical supports.&quot;</p>
<p>Influential Japanese Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara downplayed the currency impact of rising Japanese surpluses overnight by saying Japan, like the U.S., would not allow the exchange rate to be used as a trade tool. Japan's Economic Plannig Agency, however, said the pace of rising surpluses would not slow before autumn.  </p>
<p>At 1530 GMT, the dollar was trading at 112.50/60 yen compared with 112.70/75 late Monday. Mark/yen was at 64.00/03 compared with 64.31/34 late yesterday.</p>
<p>Traders said the market is shaping up for months of growing yen demand from Japanese exporters while currency turbulence in south east Asian countries like Taiwan and the Philippines, is raising concerns about central banks dollar sales in the region.</p>
<p>Sterling/mark's relentless rise to 6-year peaks above 2.97 stole the limelight in Europe after news of a bigger-than- expected jump in UK retail prices in June to 2.9 percent year-on -year stoked expectations of a UK interest rate rise Thursday.  </p>
<p>Scattered and unconfirmed talk of Bank of England sterling sales surfaced later in the day and took the pound off its highs briefly. But it rallied again in late trade to a new peak at 2.9758 and, along with the slide in mark/yen, helped drag dollar/mark above 1.76 for the first time since February 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling looks overextended at this point and even the options market is showing demand for sterling puts beyond one month,&quot; said one trader at a U.S. investment firm.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing about the pound is that it could probably retreat about 10 big figures from here without breaking its technical uptrend,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>At 1550 GMT, the dollar was trading at 1.7582/92 marks compared with 1.7506/09 in late Europe on Monday. Sterling/mark was at 2.9696/06 compared with 2.9540/50 late yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think sterling is in dangerous overshoot territory at the moment and the arguments for buying it above 2.95 marks are similar to those for buying dollars above 127 yen -- namely that it's a one-way bet,&quot; said Parsons at Paribas.</p>
<p>&quot;Like in dollar/yen (in May), the sheer weight of positions in sterling is worrisome and it may just take the same stepped-up rhetoric or threat of intervention to trigger a very sharp pullback.&quot;  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, the release of June German unemployment data had little net impact as it came broadly in line with market expectations. Adjusted jobless rose 11,000 compared with forecasts for a rise of 8,500. The adjusted unemployment rate was unchanged at 11.4 percent, according to the Bundesbank.</p>
<p>European cross rates were stable, with little to shake the basic market assumption European monetary union will start on time in 1999. Speculation about a broad-based initial memebership also remains high and the yield spread between 10-year Italian and German bonds fell below one percentage point for the first time ever.</p>
