<headline>No &quot;space aliens&quot; in New Mexico - Air Force.</headline>

<p>The U.S. Air Force said on Tuesday that &quot;space aliens&quot; who supposedly crashed in the New Mexico desert 50 years ago were only aluminum and plastic test dummies used in high-altitude parachute drops.</p>
<p>A 231-page Air Force report aimed at ending longstanding speculation over the so-called Roswell Incident denied that the military had recovered alien bodies from damaged flying saucers in 1947 and had covered up the discovery ever since.</p>
<p>Released a week before the incident's 50th anniversary, the report said the controversy began with unusual military activity near the town of Roswell but that it simply involved test balloons designed to detect Soviet missile launches.</p>
<p>It also said the bodies of aliens that witnesses reported seeing in the desert were dummies carried aloft by Air Force balloons in the 1950s and dropped in parachutes for research.</p>
<p>&quot;Air Force activities which occurred over a period of many years were consolidated and assumed to have occurred over two or three days in July of 1947,&quot; Col. John Haynes told reporters at a press conference.</p>
<p>But he could not explain how the events were compressed in people's minds, and Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters &quot;of course not&quot; when asked if the report would put the matter to rest.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably in another decade, another colonel will be out here explaining this thing again,&quot; Bacon said with a smile.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of hard evidence, Roswell has become an article of faith for those who believe in extraterrestrial life and up to 100,000 people were expected in the town next week for the golden anniversary of the alleged alien landing.</p>
<p>But the Air Force report, the second such major report by the service on Roswell in three years, was adamant.</p>
<p>&quot;This comprehensive examination of the so-called 'Roswell Incident' found no evidence whatsoever of flying saucers, space aliens or sinister government cover-ups,&quot; it said. &quot;The misrepresentations of Air Force activities as an extraterrestrial 'incident' is misleading to the public and is simply an affront to the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>To make the point, the report included photographs of human look-alike dummies and balloons being recovered.</p>
<p>The private Fund for UFO Research, based at Mount Rainier, Maryland, quickly attacked the report, noting that the test dummies were not dropped by parachute until 1955 and that the Air Force simply claimed that the time discrepancy was due to faulty memories on the part of eyewitnesses.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. Air Force proposes simply a naked theory to explain the first-hand testimony of witnesses,&quot; it said in a statement, adding that it was hard to imagine how all of the witnesses could have mistaken dummies for &quot;creatures from outside the Earth.&quot;</p>
<p>The report said claims of bodies at the Roswell Army Air Field Hospital that helped feed the speculation were most likely a combination of two separate incidents in 1956 in which 11 Air Force personnel died in a KC-97 aircraft accident and two airmen were injured in a manned balloon mishap.</p>
<p>On July 7, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release saying it was in possession of a &quot;flying disk&quot; that had fallen, but the same evening an Air Force general in Fort Worth, Texas, said the craft was in fact a weather balloon.</p>
<p>Walter Haut, the army press officer who put out the first news release, says he still believes it was accurate.</p>
<p>One of the few living witnesses, Frank Kaufmann, now 81, still insists he saw dead aliens put into body bags after their spacecraft crashed near the town 50 years ago. He was a civilian employee at Roswell Army Air Field in 1947 when he was sent to see what had crashed into a dry river bed.</p>
<p>Kaufmann said he got a close look at two bodies, one in the wreckage and one slumped against a rock wall in the river bed. &quot;They were very good-looking people, ash-coloured faces and skin ... about five feet five (1.65 metres) tall, eyes a little more pronounced, small ears, small nose, fine features and hairless,&quot; he said, adding that he saw military personnel place five corpses into body bags and remove them in jeeps.</p>
