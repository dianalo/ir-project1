<p>Germany's top economic institutes on Tuesday said Bonn has a chance to make a &quot;point landing&quot; on its budget deficit to qualify for Europe's single currency, but urged quick action to reform and consolidate state finances.</p>
<p>The six independent forecasters estimated overall GDP growth would rise to just 2.25 percent this year and 2.75 percent in 1998, a slower rate of recovery than the government is hoping for.</p>
<p>They also forecast unemployment will average 4.28 million this year, slightly higher than the 4.2 million on which Bonn is basing its calculations, and up from last year's 3.9 million.</p>
<p>The institutes still said they expect European monetary union (EMU) to start on time with a large number of countries, including Germany, but the starting roster would be a political decision that cannot be reduced to simple arithmetic targets.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a deficit of 3.2 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, falling to 2.9 percent in 1998,&quot; said economist Willi Leibfritz of the Ifo institute, speaking for the group.</p>
<p>&quot;But 3.0 percent is still thoroughly possible (in 1997).&quot;</p>
<p>The forecast is a slight improvement from the institutes' fall prognosis of a 1997 deficit equal to 3.5 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The Maastricht treaty included reference values calling for participating countries to reduce their deficits to three percent of GDP, but the institutes took pains to stress that the treaty gives leeway if progress toward the goals is clear.</p>
<p>Germany, in insisting that the criteria be strictly interpreted, is trying to elicit the best efforts from all prospective participants. But it is making its own life more difficult, the institutes said.</p>
<p>Bonn's outstanding debt is likely to exceed the 60 percent of GDP Maastricht guideline as well, but it will probably plead that the costs of German unification are a &quot;special factor&quot; that should be taken into consideration, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision will be a judgment of whether policies are sound and sustainable over the long-term,&quot; Leibfritz said. &quot;It will not be a question of pure numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>Finance minister Theo Waigel welcomed the institutes' report and said the government would be doing all in its power to meet the Maastricht deficit criterion.</p>
<p>&quot;The government will do everything necessary to achieve this goal...But possible requirements for actions can only be determined after presentation of the May tax estimates,&quot; he said, referring to next month's critical tax assessment report.</p>
<p>Ernst Schwanhold, economic spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats, said the report was a slap in the face for the government, showing it was unable to decide and act upon solutions to economic challenges including high unemployment.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the institutes said no Bundesbank interest rate rise was in sight this year unless there was a need to protect the mark from a sharp upward movement in the dollar. They forecast a small rate increase early next year.</p>
<p>The dollar moved slightly ahead to just under 1.71 marks as the institutes said they saw the U.S. currency at an average 1.80 marks in 1998.</p>
<p>Longer-term, the spring report also contained some good news for the employment situation in Germany, where joblessness is stuck near post-war record highs.</p>
<p>It said that pay deals and moves to reduce labour costs over the last year were boosting Germany's international competiteveness, forecasting a 1.5 percent drop in west German labour costs over 1996-1997.</p>
<p>Labour costs in the United States and the rest of Europe would meanwhile rise six percent and three percent respectively, they forecast.</p>
