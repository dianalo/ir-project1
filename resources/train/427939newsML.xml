<headline>Ohio River recedes but fuel shipments still halted.</headline>

<p>Flood waters began receding on parts of the Ohio River Friday, though delays in shipments of gasoline and other transportation fuels continued, Coast Guard officials said.</p>
<p>Water levels fell below the locks on the river and some barge movement had restarted, a Coast Guard spokesman said.</p>
<p>However, tanks at about 30 oil and chemical terminals on the Ohio-Kentucky and Ohio-West Virginia borders were being inspected before shipments could resume.</p>
<p>Ashland Inc, British Petroleum, Exxon Corp, Shell Oil Co, and Chevron are among the largest companies operating terminals on the Ohio River.</p>
<p>Ashland said it was unsure when its Cincinnati terminal would return to service after flood waters submerged five or six tanks there earlier this week. Some 711,000 barrels of products are stored in 31 tanks there.</p>
<p>&quot;There were some product tanks that were dislodged by the flood. They were floating. They are settled back down and there are no leaks,&quot; said Doug Shiels, spokesman for Ashland.</p>
<p>The company should not have any problems supplying customers in the area because they also operate another terminal across the river at Covington, Kentucky, he added.</p>
<p>Ashland's Catlettsburg refinery, with capacity of 219,000 barrels per day, shut three supplemental units this week and moved two barges of gasoline out of storage before tanks there could be threatened by water. But the company said the plant did not reduce runs there below capacity.</p>
