<p>Boris Becker said on Sunday he hated losing in the semifinals of a grasscourt tournament in Germany on Saturday but the defeat might boost his chances of recapturing the Wimbledon title.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss hurts but it will also have a positive effect,&quot; Becker said a day after Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated him in straight sets in the semifinals of the $875,000 grasscourt tournament in Halle.</p>
<p>&quot;If I had won the title here people would have expected too much from me in Wimbledon,&quot; said the 29-year-old Becker, who was Wimbledon champion in 1985, 1986 and 1989. &quot;Besides, not winning here makes me all the more hungry for success. I am far from satiated.&quot;</p>
<p>Becker, whose world ranking slipped from 13 to 18 with the loss on Saturday, will travel to London this week to begin preparing for his 14th consecutive Wimbledon appearance.</p>
<p>&quot;I become a completely different player on grass,&quot; said the German, who has won 49 tournaments in his career. &quot;My opponents are more afraid of me. That raises my self-confidence.&quot;</p>
