<p>A long spell of freezing weather gripping northern Europe has taken the lives of dozens of homeless people while blizzards have disrupted travel and balmy resorts have suffered freak snowfalls.</p>
<p>Several dozen people trapped in their vehicles by avalanches in a tunnel in southern Russia were finally freed, but as many as 300 people were still feared to be inside the tunnel as snow continued to fall.</p>
<p>Sections of the Danube river in central Europe were frozen over, as were major canal waterways in northern Germany, while a freak blizzard deposited up to 10 cm (four inches) of snow along Croatia's unsually balmy Dalmatian coast on the Adriatic.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul on Sunday urged people to be brave during freezing weather. &quot;I hope you are courageous in the face of the cold. Warm yourselves up,&quot; he the Pope told pilgrims gathered to hear the weekly Angelus message.</p>
<p>The cold snap began in many regions on Christmas Eve and the thermometer has dipped as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit) in the mountains of northern Italy mountains and -37C (-35F) in Poland.</p>
<p>People on the French Mediterranean resort island of Corsica awoke on Sunday to see snow covering the landscape for the first time in a decade. Thousands were without electricity as the snow brought down power cables.</p>
<p>Divers found four people dead inside the Greek cargo ship Distos which had capsized off the Greek island of Evia in bad weather in the Aegean Sea. Sixteen others aboard were missing.</p>
<p>The weather took a dire toll of people living in the open as well as the elderly and poor.</p>
<p>About 20 people have frozen to death in Romania, government general secretary Remus Opris told state radio. He said the government was providing three billion lei ($750,000) in emergency funds to help people endangered by the weather.</p>
<p>Seven weather-related deaths have been recorded in France, where police said on Sunday the body of Charles Ziegler, a 65-year-old man who had been living in a shack without heat or electricity, had been found near Strasbourg in eastern France.</p>
<p>&quot;He died of hypothermia,&quot; a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Six other homeless individuals have died from the cold weather since Wednesday, according to police.</p>
<p>The frozen bodies of three men were found at the weekend in Poland, bringing to 13 the number of deaths since the cold snap began. Most of the victims were intoxicated.</p>
<p>Polish media warned that alcohol not only does not fend off a chill but actually speeds up the loss of body heat.</p>
<p>In Warsaw, an ambulance has been taking homeless people to shelters for the duration of the cold spell.</p>
<p>Bitter cold killed a homeless man in Leipzig, Germany, on Sunday. Police said the unidentified man in his 50s was found frozen to death in an abandoned building.</p>
<p>Intense cold was believed to have caused the death of a homeless man in Valencia, Spain.</p>
<p>Temperatures have touched -25C (-18F) in Romania in the last three days and snow and blizzards have disrupted rail and road traffic and shipping.</p>
<p>&quot;We had cases when railway tracks cracked because of the low temperatures. There were no accidents,&quot; Romanian Transport Minister Traian Basescu told a news conference.</p>
<p>In Croatia, winds toppled 180 electricity poles on the Adriatic, leaving villages without power or telephone links. Hoteliers on Hvar, nicknamed the &quot;Island of Sun&quot;, were out of pocket, having advertised a free stay for tourists if snow fell.</p>
<p>Shipping authorities in Germany said more than 200 km (120 miles) of the  River Elbe would be closed at midnight on Sunday.</p>
<p>Much of central Italy was brought to a standstill by heavy snow storms, with many roads blocked and villages cut off.</p>
<p>Local authorities said the central region of Umbria was paralysed by severe wintry conditions, while the main motorway which connects Rome to the north was blocked by drifting snow.</p>
<p>The Venice lagoon froze and snow fell on the Adriatic resorts of Rimini and Ancona for the first time in years.</p>
<p>In Britain, a middle-aged married couple out walking died trying to rescue their dog after it fall through the ice of a frozen lake.</p>
<p>As British media predicted a major influenza epidemic, the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Welwyn Garden City, central England, issued a radio appeal for nurses to break their Christmas holidays to return to work.</p>
