<p>A quadruple bogey eight on the 10th hole left world number one Tiger Woods seemingly out of contention in the British Open on Friday.</p>
<p>Although he birdied the 18th to finish with a three over par 74, Woods's two-round total of 146 was 13 behind early leader Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>But the confident 21-year-old American still refused to discount his chances.</p>
<p>&quot;I was more than 13 shots back at Pebble Beach and I almost won,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In that AT&amp;T tournament earlier this year, Woods recovered with closing rounds of 63 and 64 to finish second, one stroke behind fellow American Mark O'Meara.</p>
<p>Woods, whose first round was wrecked by a triple bogey at the 11th, insisted he was playing well. &quot;I'm hitting the ball well this week, I just had two bad holes.</p>
<p>&quot;If you take away those two bad holes, I'm three under. So I'm not playing that bad. I just happen to have had two bad holes.&quot;</p>
<p>Woods's disaster at the par four 10th came when his second shot, with an eight iron from the rough, flew over the green and into thick rough.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a gorse bush right behind me. My sandwedge caught the tree behind me and went right underneath the ball,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With the ball still in thick rough, Woods hacked it a further six yards, then chipped across the green and off the front edge. A chip on to the green saw him take two putts to get down.</p>
<p>But Woods, who has said the only way to conquer this demanding course is with patience, refused to let the setback disturb his concentration. The next seven holes he completed in regulation par and he was relaxed enough to share a joke with his caddie before stepping up to sink a 20-foot putt to birdie the 18th.</p>
<p>The American had completed the first nine holes in par with his driving power setting him up for birdies on the two long par-five holes to compensate for dropped shots on the third and the fifth where he missed short putts.</p>
