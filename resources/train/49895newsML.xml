<p>The European Commission is preparing to launch a debate on how to apply European Union rules on working hours and rest periods to truck drivers, sea fishermen, doctors in training and others now excluded.</p>
<p>The European Union executive is expected to issue a &quot;white paper&quot; within the next few months on extending the Working Time Directive, which limits the average working week to 48 hours and says everyone should have four weeks paid leave a year and at least one day off a week.</p>
<p>But it will not act before the European Court of Justice issues a much-anticipated ruling on a British challenge to the existing rules, Commission spokeswoman Barbara Nolan said. That decision is expected by mid-October.</p>
<p>Britain charged that the EU improperly adopted the directive in 1993 as a health and safety measure which meant it only needed a majority vote by EU ministers, by-passing British attempts to block it.</p>
<p>The Commission has always been unhappy that the ministers exempted more than nine million workers from the directive -- in the road, rail, inland waterways and air transport sectors, workers at sea and doctors in training.</p>
<p>Some 6.5 million of the excluded workers are in the road transport sector, said Nolan, spokewoman for Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn.</p>
<p>While it might be difficult to apply the directive to transport workers who must spend long periods away from home, the Commission does not think that justifies excluding all of their colleagues, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should a clerk who works for the railways be excluded from health and safety legislation on the number of hours they work?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Commission is also worried about the implications for patients of overworked junior doctors, although she said that in many EU states they are not actual employees so would not be covered by the rules.</p>
<p>The Commission is a long way from proposing legislation, however, and at this stage is only seeking advice from trades unions, employers and others on how to proceed, she said.</p>
<p>The paper will be issued after the Commission has time to analyse the Court of Justice's ruling on the original directive, which could take some weeks or months, she added.</p>
<p>Britain suffered a preliminary setback to its challenge in March when an advocate general at the court rejected its complaint.</p>
<p>His opinion, which is influential but not binding, said the rules were properly adopted as a health and safety measure since that concept should be interpreted broadly to cover the general &quot;working environment&quot;.</p>
<p>The directive includes provisions that restrict night work to eight hours, set a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours a day and require a rest break where the working day is longer than six hours.</p>
<p>But it exempts a range of workers including managers, journalists and hospital workers from some of the provisions.</p>
