<p>Czech police on Friday charged five executives of the failed Kreditni Banka a.s. in a fraud scheme which caused losses totalling at least 2.88 billion crowns ($108.6 million), the Czech agency CTK said,</p>
<p>The executives, who were not named, were detained and charged on Friday, CTK reported quoting a state prosecutor in the western city of Plzen.</p>
<p>The bank's licence was withdrawn by the Czech National Bank in August with losses estimated at nearly 12 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The failure of Kreditni Banka, a medium-sized bank based in Plzen, caused a political furore over bank supervision, and led the government to create a special commission of ministers to lead an investigation into the case.</p>
<p>The agency quoted Plzen regional prosecutor Augustin Hrboticky as saying that the executives were charged with fraud, damage to creditors, and abetting fraud.</p>
<p>He said that investigators had identified accounts to which the 2.88 billion crowns in embezzled funds had been assigned.</p>
<p>No further details were immediately available.</p>
<p>Kreditni was the 11th of the country's then-over 50 banks to fail.</p>
<p>Local media reports have placed the blame for the failure of Kreditni Banka, majority owned by the largest insurer Ceska Pojistovna a.s. , on a series of murky loans made to interests connected to shareholders.</p>
<p>Pojistovna, which took majority stake in Kreditni in 1994, when the bank was reportedly already in a bad situation, has said it was liable for a total of nearly six billion crowns lost at Kreditni.</p>
<p>Kreditni's shareholders, after the central bank shut it in August, voted to liquidate the bank.</p>
<p>Czech National Bank Governor Josef Tosovsky, who is a member of the cabinet's investigation team which also includes the finance, justice, and interior ministers, said earlier on Friday that the country's banking system was still solid.</p>
<p>He said the four largest banks, where over 70 percent of activity is centred, were in much better shape than ever before in the former Communist economy's transition.</p>
<p>But Tosovsky that the media and political reaction to Kreditni's failure in August had temporarily destabilised the banking sector and caused a shortage in liquidity.</p>
<p>Tosovsky on Friday also supported opposition's call for forming of a parliamentary commission which would also probe into Kreditni's failure. ($ = 26.53 Czech Crowns)</p>
