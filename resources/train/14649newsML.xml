<p>First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton stood her ground on Monday, defending both herself and her husband to rousing cheers during a string of high-profile appearances at the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>&quot;What a way to start the week,&quot; she told the Arkansas delegation which gave the first lady a standing ovation lasting several minutes.</p>
<p>She began the day with an early morning appearance on CBS television during which she defended President Bill Clinton's decision to sign welfare reform legislation into law -- a subject she did not bring up again in subsequent speeches.</p>
<p>At a women's caucus event she joked about her imaginary conversations with the late first lady Eleanor Roosevelt while speaking of Jane Addams, the pioneering Chicago social worker.</p>
<p>Addams &quot;was a Republican, but the kind we used to have more of -- a progressive Republican,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Eleanor Roosevelt liked her. I know that because I've had conversations about it.&quot;</p>
<p>She praised her husband as a man with the courage to stand up to special interests.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally we have a president who stands up to the NRA (National Rifle Association). Finally we have a president who stands up to the tobacco lobby,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally we have a president who just doesn't talk tough about crime but does something about it, putting 100,000 policeman on the the streets. Finally we have a president who insures that a woman's right to choose is her right,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She told the Arkansas delegation that the same qualities they saw in her husband as governor of that state for more than a decade are the ones that warrant his re-election to the White House.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is aware of what Bill Clinton has done and will do,&quot; she said. &quot;Bill needs another four years to complete the plan for a stronger country and a better future.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know why Bill Clinton should be re-elected,&quot; she said. &quot;You know better than anyone else. There is nothing new at all. We see the same man with the same committments.&quot;</p>
<p>At a meeting of the Connecticut delegation, Sen. Chris Dodd, who also serves as party chairman, introduced the first lady by referring obliquely to attacks made on her during the Republican convention in San Diego.</p>
<p>Dodd referred to Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole's mocking of the first lady's book &quot;It Takes a Village&quot; by saying Dole should limit his comments to books he's actually read.</p>
<p>&quot;Hillary Rodham Clinton has more decency, more honour and more integrity than all of her self-appointed critics combined,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;People believe we are fighting on behalf of their interests and no one articulates this better than Hillary Rodham Clinton,&quot; Dodd said.</p>
