<p>Clean tanker rates softened this week as the level of enquiry fell in the Middle East and the Mediterranean, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said tonnage was building up in the Middle East, with 30,000 tonne vessels fixed down at W280 and 40,000/45,000 tonnes at W285 on trips to West Coast India.</p>
<p>&quot;Charterers' current ideas are much below these levels and it will take at least a couple of weeks for the present pessimism to dissipate,&quot; said brokers E.A. Gibson in their weekly report.</p>
<p>In the Med gas oil cargoes fell sharply but naphtha rates held up at W300 or slightly above for 27,500 tonne cargoes.</p>
<p>Brokers said transatlantic gasoline rates remained firm at W278 for 30,000 tonnes but there was much less enquiry than earlier in the month.</p>
<p>Inter-U.K. clean product rates were firm due to a shortage of smaller vessels that had been lured away to the Med. One broker said about W200 had been paid for gas oil from the Baltic.</p>
<p>In the U.S., rates fell towards the end of the week, with 30,000 tonnes Caribs/upcoast at W320 on Friday against W340 earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;It's fairly quiet and that is pushing the market down,&quot; a U.S. broker said.</p>
