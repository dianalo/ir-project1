<p>A judge on Monday dismissed charges against a former football player whose parents and sister are on trial for allegedly receiving luxury goods stolen from a department store by a hired thief.</p>
<p>Ramsey County Judge Salvador Rosas dropped the charges against James Dick, 32, who played with the Minnesota Vikings, because of mistakes by investigators that he said prejudiced his case.</p>
<p>The trial of his father, wealthy dentist Gerald Dick, 58, his wife Judy, 56, and daughter Stacy Zehren, a 33-year-old lawyer, was ordered to continue.</p>
<p>The case captured nationwide attention after Dayton's Department Store security personnel caught a convicted thief, Gregory Thomas, shoplifting expensive items. He later participated in a sting against the Dick family.</p>
<p>Thomas testified he had shoplifted pricey items such as crystal and expensive clothing for years for the Dick family, often stealing goods they had specifically ordered.</p>
