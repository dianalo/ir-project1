<title>MEXICO: Poll gives Mexico's PRI lead in Mexico City race.</title>
<headline>Poll gives Mexico's PRI lead in Mexico City race.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-03-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) was the most popular choice for the second month running in the race to become mayor of Mexico City, according to a poll on Friday.</p>
<p>But Mexico's main leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) was making a strong challenge in the July 6 race after it named the party's ageing founder Cuauhtemoc Cardenas to stand as its candidate.</p>
<p>In July, Mexico City residents will pick their first-ever elected mayor, ending a practice in which the previous incumbent was always appointed by the president.</p>
<p>The race is seen as an important referendum on the future of President Ernesto Zedillo's party, the PRI, which has ruled Mexico for 68 years but has been pounded in several state elections since Mexico plunged into economic crisis in 1994.</p>
<p>The monthly Berumen y Asociados survey of 800 citizens dealt a heavy blow to the conservative National Action Party (PAN), considered Mexico's second strongest party.</p>
<p>According to results of the poll, the PAN had been the top choice for most of the last seven months, but its support slumped after it named in early March an academic, Carlos Catillo Perazo, as its candidate.</p>
<p>It polled 21 percent, compared to 28 percent for the PRI and 24 percent for the PRD, the survey said.</p>
<p>The PRD has made a strong comeback since it named Cardenas, a twice-beaten presidential candidate, as its representative. Its support rose from 17 percent in February to 24 percent in March, while the PRI has stood at 28 percent for the last two months.</p>
<p>The poll did not indicate the margin of error in the poll.</p>
