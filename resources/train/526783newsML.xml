<p>Standard and Poor's, one of the leading U.S. rating agencies, is kicking up a storm by declaring that some corporate issuers are more creditworthy than their home countries and the move has met with mixed reactions from analysts and money managers in the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;The sovereign ceiling has been the gospel for 10 to 15 years,&quot; said Tulio Vera, a managing director at Bear Stearns. &quot;It is coming apart.&quot;</p>
<p>Although applied only to &quot;dollarized&quot; economies, which means the currency is closely pegged to the U.S. dollar, it has far-reaching implications on how relative risks are perceived, he said.</p>
<p>In a release on Tuesday, S&amp;P said it had concluded that &quot;the sovereign credit risk now is less a factor affecting ratings of issuers in certain dollarized economies than is the case more generally.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Once the dollarization passes 40 percent of measured financial assets, it is difficult to reverse because of the high cost for the private sector of switching back to local currency transactions,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A number of issuers based in Argentina received upgrades by up to two notchers above the Republic's double B rating.</p>
<p>The spreads of those corporate bonds over U.S. Treasuries tightened by an average of 20 basis points, according to trading sources.</p>
<p>Republic of Argentina eurobonds also rallied. Argentina GLB-17 rose 1-3/8 to 104-3/8 bid amid short-covering and buying in sympathy with corporate bonds, they said.</p>
<p>Vera considered the upgrades, which were predicated on Argentina's &quot;dollarization&quot;, stood on somewhat shaky grounds.</p>
<p>Argentina has a convertibility plan for only six years, and its central bank still runs a &quot;bi-monetary system&quot; of the dollar and the peso existing side by side.</p>
<p>&quot;When the push comes to shove, is Argentina that different from other economies?&quot; he said, adding: &quot;The track record was pretty short.&quot;</p>
<p>A fund manager from a large U.S. bank echoed the same doubts about the durability of Argentina's convertibility plan.</p>
<p>&quot;This rating action must have been made by a group of people with no sense of history,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the century, Argentina established a currency board in 1901 and ditched it in 1929. Shortly later, the government slapped on exchange control and defaulted on substantially all its international bond issues, he said.</p>
<p>Peter Allen, head of emerging markets research at BancBoston Securities, was also troubled by the complacent assumption that Argentina's currency board was irreversible.</p>
<p>By comparison, Panama makes a better case for rating corporate credit above sovereign, because the country did not impose exchange control even in the grimmest days of the Noriega government, he said.</p>
<p>Corporate issuers in Paraguay, another dollarized economy, may also be affected by the new methodolody, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>But some analysts were cheered by S&amp;P's new approach.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a long-needed change.&quot; said Kip Allardt, emerging market debt strategist at CS First Boston.</p>
<p>He noted that a company's ability to pay off its debt is sometimes greater than a country's, especially when the assets are outside the country.</p>
<p>And it is not reasonable to assume that if a sovereign issuer cannot pay its debt, it would automatically seize coroporate assets, he said.</p>
<p>Richard Segal, head of emerging market fixed income research at Santander Investments, said the S&amp;P's methodology change was &quot;evolutionary&quot; as a clutch of collateralized bonds had been rated above their sovereign ceilings.</p>
<p>But he admitted that a small &quot;leap of faith&quot; is needed and investors must contend with a confusing landscape of &quot;split-rated&quot; credits.</p>
<p>Many firms are devoting considerable resources to do their own credit ratings, Segal said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P has recently taken a more liberal approach to credit assessment than other rating groups. On March 2, it raised the sovereign credit of Argentina to double B from double B-minus and Brazil to double B-minus from single B, while its rival Moody's Investors stood by its existing ratings.</p>
