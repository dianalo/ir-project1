<headline>Italian parliament begins confidence debate.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-05-06</dateline>

<p>Italy's Chamber of Deputies (lower house) began a debate on Tuesday on a confidence motion called by the centre-left government to speed up approval of its 1997 mini-budget.</p>
<p>The vote, which Prime Minister Romano Prodi is expected to win, was scheduled to take place from around 1445 GMT.</p>
<p>The government, which drew up the mini-budget to boost Italy's chances of joining Europe's planned single currency, called the vote on Monday.</p>
<p>The confidence test will be the 21st such do-or-die vote since Prodi took office a year ago. It has drawn howls of protest from the opposition, which accuses the government of trying to prevent parliament from challenging its decisions.</p>
<p>Victory in Tuesday's vote would sweep away some 400 opposition amendments to the package, designed to cut 15.5 trillion lire ($9.1 billion) from this year's deficit in a bid to meet tough criteria for founder membership of the new euro currency at its planned launch in January 1999.</p>
<p>The package then moves to the Senate (upper house)</p>
<p>The 1997 mini-budget has been lambasted by the opposition and even by centrists within Prodi's own coalition for demanding early payment of taxes by companies on severance payment funds.</p>
<p>The Treasury initially sought six trillion lire from the anticipated taxes on severance funds but agreed, in the face of widespread discontent, to reduce this to five trillion and make up the difference with the help of tax amnesties.</p>
<p>The cut was not enough for many parliamentarians and the budget committee rejected the proposed mini-budget last month after two centre-left deputies broke ranks withe the government.</p>
<p>The hard-left Communist Refoundation party, which secures Prodi's majority in the lower house, voted with the government and budget rebels in the committee indicated they would back the coalition if the budget was put to a confidence test.</p>
<p>($ = 1710 Italian Lire)</p>
