<title>SOUTH KOREA: Samsung in $2 billion deal to supply monitors to IBM.</title>

<text>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd has won a $2 billion, three-year deal to supply personal computer monitors to International Business Machines Corp., according to sources at the South Korean company.</p>
<p>The sources said Tuesday that Samsung Electronics, flagship of the giant Samsung Group, will make five million monitors for IBM desk-top PCs over three years beginning in March.</p>
<p>The monitors will be 15-inch or 17-inch models, they said.</p>
<p>A Samsung spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said the deal was a vote of confidence by IBM in the quality and technology of the South Korean firm's products. It will also help Samsung lock up stable demand for the next three years, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Samsung's biggest merit for the IBM deal was securing stable demand for PC monitors,&quot; said Park Chan-yup, an electronics analyst at Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics, the world's largest computer monitor supplier, expects exports of 10 million monitors next year, against eight million this year, a Samsung official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The long-term agreement means Samsung has earned recognition from IBM in terms of monitor technology and quality,&quot; said Han Ilsuk, electronics analyst at ING-Barings Securities.</p>
<p>Samsung has supplied a smaller number of monitors to IBM before on a one-year basis, the Samsung official said.</p>
<p>Analysts viewed the deal favourably, considering the world's supply of PC monitors could outweigh demand in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>&quot;PC monitor supplies could slowly outpace demand as rising demand for liquid crystal display monitors are expected to grow, squeezing the demand for PC monitors,&quot; said Hyundai's Park. &quot;It's a profitable deal considering those monitors could have piled up in stock.&quot;</p>
<p>But industry sources said the contract would not be lucrative enough to offset a plunge in Samsung's semiconductor sales, the company's biggest revenue earner.</p>
<p>&quot;This is likely to help us recover our profitability, but not enough to cover for the slump in semiconductors,&quot; the Samsung official said.</p>
