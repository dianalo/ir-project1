<p>Enron Corp's joint venture deal with Italy's Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica SpA shows that continental Europe is going to be a tough nut to crack for U.S. power producers, say analysts.</p>
<p>Houston-based Enron on Tuesday said that it and the Italian state-owned electricty distribution monopoly would each invest $300 million equity stakes in a joint venture with 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity and aimed to take advantage of deregulation in Italy and Europe-wide.  </p>
<p>The deal follows hard on the heels of the $1.7 billion paid by Southern Co and Veba AG for a 50 percent stake in Berlin electricity supplier Bewag.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. power producers are paying quite a high price for companies which are just about to go into a more extreme form of competition,&quot; said Simon Allen, a consultant at Price Waterhouse in London.</p>
<p>What U.S. companies hope is that by getting a toehold now, they will be winners when electricity deregulation in the European Union kicks off in 1999 when 30 percent of the power market, a slice worth $50 billion, will be opened.  </p>
<p>Yet the road to deregulation across the whole continent is not going to be easy.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there are interconnectors between countries, they were built as emergency supply systems, not as part of an integrated power trading system,&quot; said Allen.</p>
<p>Without Europe-wide rules, owners of these transmission lines are also likely to be able to claim that the lines are running at capacity or that they are in use for long term contracts.</p>
<p>Some analysts are also sceptical of Enron's commitment.  </p>
<p>&quot;We know that Enron was also a bidder for Bewag yet pulled out, you get the impression with Enron that they have 20 projects in 20 different countries and if they do not get their top pick they just walk away,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>Enron's Italian deal, for around one-tenth of the monopoly's total generating capacity also raises some problems for the Houston-based power marketer.</p>
<p>Analysts note that Enel has already signed a deal with Italy's Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi SpA to build natural gas cogeneration plants and it is unlikely that ENI will agree to let Enron in.  </p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if Enron may have missed the march on this one,&quot; said Chris Rogers, analyst at UBS in London.</p>
<p>There are tie-ups similar to the Enel/ENI relationship already in Spain and other countries as well.</p>
<p>Also, unlike the emerging economies of Latin America where Enron can bring superior technology and management, in Europe, Enron will be dealing with sophisticated utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not as if these companies will not have thought of this, they are not going to surrender market share to Enron, they will do it themselves,&quot; said Rogers.  </p>
<p>The only way in for U.S. companies to achieve a major role in continental Europe is likely to be via the joint venture route, say analysts, and market share is likely to be five to seven percent, rather than the 20 or so percent that the U.S. energy giants are seeking.</p>
<p>&quot;One also has to question whether with so many projects on the books, a company like Enron has the brainpower to keep all these things going at once,&quot; said one analyst. ((-- David Chance New York Newsroom 212 859 1902))</p>
