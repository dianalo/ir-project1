<headline>Euro oil swaps steady, firmer after Thursday gains.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>European oil swaps were broadly steady after Thursday's surge although business was noticeably slower after some busy dealing yesterday.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs firmed by a few cents, naphtha rose 50 cents or so, fuel held steady as did gasoline.</p>
<p>Dealers said July 21-25 was pegged around +7 cents against September from +3/4 cents and July 28-August 1 at -3 cents from -7/8 cents. August 4-8 was pegged at -6 cents from -10 cents against September Brent while August 11-15 was flat at -13 cents.</p>
<p>CFD trading was very thin, and nothing was heard done.</p>
<p>Naphtha swaps ticked up slightly with August valued around $191.25 and September at $189.</p>
<p>Gasoline was steady with August around $193.25 and September at $191. Physical eurograde barges sold at $191 fob AR and $193 fob Rotterdam amid tightish prompt supply.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel swaps held at yesterday's levels with physical barges creeping up to close the gap. Wet barrels sold at $89 fob and $90 fob with August swaps valued around $90.</p>
<p>Low sulphur swaps were expected to widen the high-low spread and extend gains past the current $97.25 level for August and $98.25 for September.</p>
