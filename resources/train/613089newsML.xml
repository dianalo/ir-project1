<p>Germany's Free Democrats (FDP), junior partners in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, adopted a resolution on Sunday against tax hikes to plug shortfalls in the state budget.</p>
<p>Delegates at a party congress backed a leadership motion which also said the FDP would not give up on a coalition deal to cut a tax raised to pay for German unification by two percentage points next year.</p>
<p>Christian Democrats in Kohl's ruling alliance have floated the idea of an increase in petrol tax this year to cover a big shortfall in state revenues and enable Germany to qualify for European monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>FDP parliamentary leader Hermann Otto Solms told around 660 delegates earlier that he expected his coalition partners to stand by the agreement to cut the solidarity tax.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything else would undermine the foundations of this coalition,&quot; Solms said.</p>
<p>The FDP, which provides the Kohl government with its 12-seat majority, is hoping to survive as a parliamentary party at next year's general election by campaigning for tax cuts.</p>
<p>But most Germans are sceptical that the party will hold to its line. A survey on Saturday by the Forsa polling group for RTL television found that 68 percent of Germans expected the FDP to give up its &quot;no&quot; to tax increases under pressure from their bigger coalition partners.</p>
