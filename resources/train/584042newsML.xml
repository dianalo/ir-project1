<headline>France's Seguin says Maastricht should be adapted.</headline>

<p>French National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin said in an interview on Wednesday that the criteria for a single European currency could not be interpreted literally and the Maastricht treaty would have to be adapted.</p>
<p>Seguin, a member of President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist party who campaigned against the treaty in a 1992 referendum, told Paris-Match magazine the economic convergence criteria should be &quot;one reference among others&quot; for deciding who joined the planned single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you imagine disqualifying a country on the pretext that its deficit is 3.3 percent of gross domestic product and not 3.1 percent, as if it were a game, and as if a currency were strong at three percent and suddenly became weak at 3.3?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show Seguin is the most popular candidate for prime minister among conservative voters if the centre-right coalition is re-elected in a May 25-June 1 parliamentary election.</p>
<p>&quot;The convergence criteria are important but in terms of the trend...The great European project can't be reduced to a simple accounting calculation. That would be the surest way of making it a failure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Seguin said European Union member governments probably had their last chance in 1998 to put employment at the heart of European integration.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone knows very well that the Maastricht treaty cannot be applied to the letter, that it will have to be renegotiated, adapted, completed, spelled out...for its own salvation and for ours,&quot; he said.</p>
