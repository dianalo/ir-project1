<p>Iran said on Monday the military advance of the hardline Taleban movement in Afghanistan posed a national security concern for the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The Moslem fundamentalist militia, which captured the Afghan capital Kabul a week ago, controls about two-thirds of the country where they have imposed their own fundamentalist brand of Islam.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever happens in Afghanistan affects our national security, therefore, we cannot remain indifferent towards it,&quot; Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in an interview published in the evening newspaper Ettelaat.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran is eying its neighbours, especially Afghanistan, with special sensitivity...No country has any right to intervene in Afghanistan,&quot; Velayati was quoted as saying in an exclusive interview with the paper.</p>
<p>Shi'ite Moslem Iran supported the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and was hostile to the Sunni fundamentalist Taleban. Iran's media has accused the Taleban of being manipulated by Pakistan and the United States.</p>
<p>Pakistan denies charges from Afghanistan's ousted government that Islamabad gave military help to the Taleban.</p>
<p>Earlier in Monday, Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blasted the Taleban movement as &quot;un-Islamic&quot; and also said it was backed by the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;In Iran's neighbourhood, unfortunately, un-Islamic and unacceptable deeds are done in the name of Islam by a group whose knowledge of Islam is questionable,&quot; Khamenei was quoted as saying by state-run Tehran radio.</p>
<p>Khamenei, who was addressing clergymen in Tehran, criticized what he called U.S. support for the Taleban.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only did Americans not condemn them (Taleban) but they also stood behind them...Some politicians implied the purpose of American support for that group was to confront Iran,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Speaking to Ettelaat, Velayati repeated his conviction that the prospects for peace in Afghanistan were poor without a broad-based government in Kabul.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a wrong idea that some think Afghanistan should be monopolized by one single ethnic or religious group,&quot; he said. &quot;The Taleban are part of the Afghan people and like other (groups) should participate in the government.&quot;</p>
