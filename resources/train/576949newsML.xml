<headline>EU central banks unlikely to sell more gold - Stals.</headline>

<p>South African Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals sees little prospect of further gold sales by European Union (EU) central banks.</p>
<p>In an interview to be published in the spring edition of the quarterly Central Banking magazine Stals said, &quot;There were a few (central banks) who wanted to bring their holdings into line with the EU average; that has been done.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't know of any other central banks that want to sell gold at this stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Stals added that there were no signs of the European central banks buying gold, and that chances of national banks elsewhere adding to their reserves were not high either.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no big demand for gold from official agencies even in the Far East at present,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So the market is very dependent on supply and demand in the jewellery industry and with smaller sales from the central banks the market will remain reasonably well balanced,&quot; Stals said.</p>
<p>He did not see the prospect of gold being sold by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as imposing a great burden on the market.</p>
<p>The IMF has discussed the possibility of selling around five million ounces from its reserves over several years to raise revenue for its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) used to help the world's poorest countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The funding of the new trust fund to assist highly indebted low-income countries is not going to involve significant sales of gold by the fund in the near term,&quot; Stals said.</p>
<p>&quot;The question of possible sales will not come back on to the agenda until the year 2000,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The gold market has been depressed by the threat of European central bank and IMF gold sales for more than a year.</p>
<p>Last year Belgium sold just over 200 tonnes of gold from its reserves and in January this year the Netherlands central bank announced it had disposed of 300 tonnes of gold.</p>
<p>Selling gold is one way central banks can assist their countries come into line with the Maastricht Treaty criteria for joining the European Monetary Union.</p>
