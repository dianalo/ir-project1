<p>The world 100 metres record is about to cross a new frontier, according to top U.S. coach John Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason why they shouldn't be running 9.7,&quot; Smith said in an interview.</p>
<p>Smith, who coaches new American champion Maurice Greene and Trinidad's Ato Boldon said Donovan Bailey's current world mark of 9.84 &quot;is not that fast&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last 20 years, we've only gone from 9.95 to 9.84,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at the 200, and the 400 in the last 20 years. Look at the long jump where it is gone. The 100 is the next frontier to come forward. Ato and all of the rest of them should be running low 9.8s or high 9.7s.</p>
<p>&quot;I see that in Donovan, I see that in Frankie Fredericks, in those two (Boldon and Greene) and a couple of other sprinters as soon as they all get it together.&quot;</p>
<p>The retirement of Carl Lewis and the aging of other top sprinters like Linford Christie and Dennis Mitchell are pushing today's sprinters toward performances never before achieved, he said.    &quot;These young kids are sitting there, saying 'Just a</p>
<p>moment, somebody has got to step up',&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith said there was  also more competition between the top sprinters and more quality times.</p>
<p>&quot;When it gets crowded, somebody is going to jump out of the crowd. And it is getting real crowded at 9.9.&quot;</p>
<p>He would not, however, predict a world record at Sunday's 100 metres final at the sixth world championships.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know the facility, I don't know the wind,&quot; Smith said. &quot;But it would not surprise me if they run extremely fast.&quot;</p>
<p>It also would not be a surprise to Smith if Michael Johnson's 200 metres world record of 19.32 seconds came under attack soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone say it is out there,&quot; said Smith, who still holds the 440 yard world record. &quot;I don't believe it. He did it, we can do it.</p>
<p>&quot;Ato is a 9.9 sprinter. A consistent 9.9 sprinter who should be able to run the turn in about 10.15. If he can run 10.15, I know he can run a flying 9.2. That's 19.35.</p>
<p>&quot;So it is just a matter of playing with the arithmetic and learning how to run the race correctly.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael has set a precedent whereas basically a quarter-miler holds the world record in the 200. It's kind of ticking the sprinters off.&quot;</p>
