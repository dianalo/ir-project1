<p>The Dow Jones industrial average surged to its fourth consecutive record finish on Wednesday, while bonds held steady as traders awaited key U.S. economy reports due on Thursday.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to a seven-month low against the Japanese yen amid concern over growing U.S.-Japanaese trade frictions.</p>
<p>The Dow climbed 36.56 to close at 7,575.83, surpassing the previous all-time high of 7,539.27 on Tuesday. In the broader market, advancers outpaced decliners 1,509 to 1,024 on heavy volume of 513.7 million on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 500 million shares changed hands for the second day in a row.</p>
<p>The broad rally lifted large-cap and small-cap indexes and saw technology stocks reverse Tuesday's losses.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology shares, rose 6.16 points to 1,407.85.</p>
<p>&quot;The rest of the market just seems to be tagging along behind the blue chips,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>Beyond the tech stocks, which erased early losses to end higher, the market was a model of calm, an atmosphere that stood in stark contrast to the volatility of the recent past.</p>
<p>&quot;The market appears to be settling down after its rapid acceleration,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;But the bulls just continue to dominate, and it looks like this could be the tilt for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Cyclical stocks, particularly shares in paper and pulp companies, were among the best performers.</p>
<p>While the market shows no clear signs of halting in its advance, analysts said some kind of pause certainly appears due, with the Dow industrials now up a sizzling 18.5 percent -- or nearly 1,200 points -- in the last two months.</p>
<p>&quot;You could have a pullback any time here,&quot; Zagorski said, adding the Dow &quot;could easily come down a couple of hundred points, but even that wouldn't make a bit of difference to its long-term trend.&quot;</p>
<p>In the bond market, the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury was unchanged, with a yield of 6.84 percent.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to a low of 110.62 yen overseas and closed at 111.15 yen vs. 112.20 late Tuesday. The dollar slid to 1.7164 German marks from 1.7185 marks.</p>
<p>Coffee prices slid to six-week lows as speculators continued to sell against a background of mild winter weather in top producer Brazil and a lack of buying interest from roasters.</p>
<p>Coffee for July delivery at the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York closed 10.30 cents a pound lower at 207.65 cents, down 35 percent from the 20-year high of 318 cents on May 29.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, grain prices closed higher ahead of a monthly estimate of world crops by the Agriculture Department on Thursday. Worries about low world grain stocks and possible global weather problems supported buying.</p>
<p>Soybeans for July delivery closed 17-1/2 cents a bushel higher at $8.30-1/2, with July corn up 3/4 cent a bushel at $2.72-1/2 and July wheat up 1-1/2 cents a bushel at $3.64-1/2.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum group metal prices continued to rise with a date for the resumption of exports from top producer Russia still unclear. Russia halted exports in December, causing a steep drawdown in world stocks.</p>
<p>Platinum for July delivery ended up $4.90 at $443.80 an ounce and palladium for September delivery closed up $4.70 at $178.50 an ounce.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 finished 14.8 points off at 4,724.8 after setting a new peak of 4,759.3. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average shed 242.62 points to finish at 20,289.93.</p>
