<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch bonds closed mixed on Thursday, as the short maturities were slightly pressured by a 0.20 percent hike in the special advances rate and longer paper was buoyed by increased demand in a thin market.</p>
<p>Dealers said many players had expected the rate hike, adding it had already been discounted in short bond prices and money market rates since the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>&quot;Short bonds will be stable if there's a rate hike, they will move if there is no hike,&quot; one dealer said before the Dutch central bank announced its decision.</p>
<p>The short benchmark remained stable, losing 0.02 points.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is nothing more than a technical adjustment, following the continued weakening of the guilder versus the mark,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>He added market players had confidence in the market's long term performance, which had pushed prices of longer-dated paper up.</p>
<p>Buying on dips was seen giving good support, today as well as in the near future.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected bonds to move in a tight range for a while as the market had to stabilise after the rally of recent weeks.</p>
