<title>GREECE: Greek shares end down on cash shortage, new law.</title>
<headline>Greek shares end down on cash shortage, new law.</headline>
<dateline>ATHENS 1996-10-17</dateline>

<p>Greek equities fell another 1.13 percent in low turnover. Brokers said the market was hit by a combination of a cash shortage and the negative effect of a law governing investment services, effective November 1.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse came under selling pressure again today because of the lack of fresh cash injections and concern about the negative side effects of law 2396/96 governing the operation of investment firms in Greece,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>The chairman of Greece's Capital Markets Commission, Stavros Thomadakis, presented three regulations on Thursday concerning the implementation of law 2396/96 which was voted in parliament last April and goes into effect on November 1.</p>
<p>The law outlines the general framework governing the activities of firms offering investment services in Greece and harmonises Greek law with European Union legislation.</p>
<p>The broker said a number of brokerage houses are now being forced to reduce their equity holdings to pay for shares bought on behalf of their clients which they financed.</p>
<p>&quot;I put the blame squarely on the government which should be aware of the current situation and the related problems,&quot; the broker said. &quot;I am convinced the worse is not over yet unless something is done about extending the November 1 deadline.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I expect a bourse recovery after the presentation of the 1997 budget,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The market was waiting to see how National Economy and Finance Minister Yannos Papandoniou would shape the 1997 draft budget, due by the end of November.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed down 1.13 percent, or 10.55 points at 937.70 from Tuesday's 941.70 close after opening at 940.05 points.</p>
<p>Turnover was at 7.60 billion drachmas on volume of 4.47 million shares boosted by block trades in Parnassos, Alpha Credit Bank ACBr.AT and National Bank of Greece.</p>
