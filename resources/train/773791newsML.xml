<title>UK: North Sea crude market ends week with healthy glow.</title>
<headline>North Sea crude market ends week with healthy glow.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The North Sea crude market ended the week  close to where it started after unremarkable but consistent buying  kept differentials fairly steady.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still looking like a very healthy market,&quot; said one trader.  &quot;It's not fantastically strong but every cargo is getting a pretty  good price.&quot;</p>
<p>All of the three Brent cargoes nominated from the paper chains on  Friday were kept early. One, loading Aug 18-20, was sold on by a U.S.  refiner to a Wall street trader at Aug Brent +3 cents, three cents  down from a deal done on Thursday.</p>
<p>Outright prices mostly reversed early gains by late in the day. September  Brent was trading two cents down at $18.92 a barrel at 1752 GMT.</p>
<p>Brent intermonth spreads held firm, with August/September talked at  +25/40 cents late in the day after trading at +30 cents earlier. Sept/Oct  moved up a notch to -3/-1 cents.</p>
<p>CFDs for next week (Aug 4-8) held a strong backwardation of around  12-15 cents to the following week (Aug 11-15) which traded at September  Brent parity in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Other North Sea grades were actively traded but mostly on a confidential  basis. A prompt Statfjord was heard to have changed hands at a slightly  weaker level than recent trades, but still above Dated Brent +20 cents.  A Statfjord, Oseberg and Gullfaks C loading later in August all fetched  steady premiums, traders said.</p>
<p>Statfjord cargoes with later loading dates were benefiting from a  three-day delay in the August programme, they said.</p>
<p>Improving margins, helped by news that three catalytic crackers in  northwest Europe were out of action, were helping to bolster refinery  interest.</p>
<p>Sour crude in the Mediterranean was steady but buyers were starting  to lose interest with expectations growing that Iraqi exports could  be flowing by the middle of this month.</p>
<p>Benchmark Russian Urals crude was still pegged at around Dated Brent  -60 cents but was seen set to fall.</p>
