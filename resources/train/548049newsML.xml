<headline>Euro oil swaps mixed, crude and gas oil edge highe.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>European oil swaps were mixed on Tuesday. Crude and gas oil swaps firmed on tighter supply and good demand, fuel swaps eased on weaker spot markets while gasoline and naphtha swaps held steady, traders said.</p>
<p>Brent contracts for difference (CFDs) saw prompt differentials slipping while distant weeks steadied slightly with physical avails slightly tighter.</p>
<p>This week was offered three cents weaker at June Brent -34 cents, next week talked steady at June -32 cents. Further out May 12-16 was four cents firmer at around June Brent -30/-26 cents while the week after was some six cents stronger at June Brent -27/-25 cents.</p>
<p>Longer term crude swaps were steady though showing only a narrow contango spanning 30 cents to the end of the year.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps continued to firm up as volatility to the upside with May gas oil futures breaking $167 resistance in early trade fuelling good buying for swaps.</p>
<p>&quot;The good physical buying and lack of sellers is causing people to load up with swaps as a hedge against the volatility,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>EN590 May contracts were bid at $13.50, up from $12 last Friday while May 0.2 sulphur swaps were bid at $5, $1 firmer and June talked $3.50/$4 as premiums to the IPE.</p>
<p>EN590/0.2 sulphur differentials were actively traded with May done at a slightly firmer $8.75, June at $8.25 and $8.75 after finishing last Friday at around $7.50/$8. Further out Q3 contracts differentials traded at $8 a couple of time and $8.25.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel swaps came under renewed pressure from low sulphur which was offered 50 cents a tonne below late Monday levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Barges are about a dollar lower but low sulphur is causing the damage,&quot; said a Rotterdam trader.</p>
<p>May barges swaps talked around $81 by lunchtime compared to trade in the range $81.50 to $82.25 on Monday. June was 50 cents higher and July $1 above May.</p>
<p>The third quarter was heading toward $85 having traded at $85.50 and $85.75 on Monday.</p>
<p>Cargo CIF NWE swaps were $1 below barges in May but nearer 50 cents in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Low sulphur asked $84.50 for May amid strong selling pressure from the physical market at $95 cif Italy. June asked $1.50 higher on paper but little trade was heard.</p>
<p>Gasoline swap quotes were notional as good physical supplies kept buying interest thin. However, traders expected the market to pick up a little soon. This sentiment was reflected in a $2-3 backwardation for May contracts over June.</p>
<p>&quot;We're pretty bullish for May and June...We've seen very little since the buying spree in April,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>May swaps were valued steady around $195.50 with June at $193 a tonne fob ARA.</p>
<p>Naphtha talk was thin. May swaps edged up 50 cents to $180/$181 a tonne with June at $182.50/$183.50 and July valued near $183.</p>
