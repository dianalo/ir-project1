<p>South Africa's &quot;truth commission&quot; announced on Tuesday that apartheid security policemen were seeking amnesty for the killing in detention of black activist Steve Biko.</p>
<p>Following are excerpts and a summary of a statement from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) about the events surrounding Biko's death on September 12, 1977.</p>
<p>&quot;Backed up by the prospect of amnesty, (investigations have) resulted in amnesty applications in which members of the former security branch of the South African Police acknowledge responsibility for...assaults on Stephen Bantu Biko...and the killing of Mr Biko.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The information we have gathered constitutes a major breakthrough. Numerous earlier investigations and judicial inquiries have not conclusively resolved the cases and our investigative work, combined with the prospect of amnesty, has persuaded those who say they were involved in perpetrating the acts to come forward for the first time,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Applications have been filed by a number of former security policemen who have indicated they are applying for amnesty in respect of charges of assault and culpable homicide.</p>
<p>&quot;They have not yet provided details of their precise involvement in these crimes and the commission is expecting to receive amplifications of their amnesty applications in due course.&quot;</p>
<p>The commission said it was trying to verify the claims of culpability and the TRC's amnesty committee would then have to decide on possible pardons for those who had confessed.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result, we will not at this stage provide full details of information at our disposal nor will the Commission make available names of amnesty applicants at this stage.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also not convinced that all those who bear responsibility for the acts and omissions which led to the deaths of people have come forward.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement said security policemen had also applied for amnesty in connection with the cases of nine other black activists who were abducted and murdered in the 1980s.</p>
