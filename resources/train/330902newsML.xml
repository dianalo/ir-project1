<headline>Dade County, Fla., mayor plans New York City visit.</headline>
<dateline>MIAMI 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>The mayor of Florida's Dade County and an entourage of finance, tourism and economic development officials have scheduled a visit to New York City next week to discuss the impact of Miami's financial woes on the county.</p>
<p>Dade Mayor Alex Penelas has insisted repeatedly that investors know the difference between the city and county been affected by Miami's budget deficit.</p>
<p>Penelas has also encouraged tourists to keep visiting, pointing that the airport and seaport are run by the county, not the city, and that Miami is only a small part of the metropolitan area.</p>
<p>To make sure that message gets across, a public relations firm hired by the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau is hosting a luncheon on January 29 &quot;to set the record straight&quot; for the New York media.</p>
<p>Penelas has also scheduled interviews with reporters from a multitude of financial and tourism publications and news services, including Reuters.</p>
<p>Penelas will be accompanied by Assistant County Manager David morris, who oversees Dade bond issues; finance director Rachel Baum; Bond Administrator Lydia Monzon-Aguirre: Commissionier Jimmy Morales, who chairs the county's finance and trust fund committee; and other officials from the visitors' bureau and the Beacon Council economic development group.</p>
<p>The visitors' bureau and Beacon Council are paying for the trip.</p>
<p>Miami, which is Dade's county seat, is struggling to close a $68 million deficit in its budget for the year that began Oct.1, and has been placed under the watch of a state-appointed oversight board.</p>
<p>But the city is only one of 29 municipalities that make up the metropolitan Miami area.</p>
