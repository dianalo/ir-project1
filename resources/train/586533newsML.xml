<headline>Kmart, Gap report higher first-quarter earnings.</headline>
<dateline>TROY, Mich. 1997-05-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kmart Corp. Thursday reported a profit for the first quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier, as costs declined while sales grew.</p>
<p>&quot;Kmart's earnings for the first quarter were on plan, with good balance between sales, gross margin and expense controls,&quot; said Floyd Hall, chairman, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The nation's No. 2 retailer had a first-quarter profit of $14 million, or three cents a share, up from a loss of $99 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>The year-ago period included charges of $63 million, or 13 cents per share, related to the disposal of Kmart's stakes in Thrifty PayLess Holdings, Inc. and Builders Square.</p>
<p>Sales rose to $7.26 billion from $6.97 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>The discount store giant said selling, general and administrative expenses fell to $1.49 billion from $1.52 billion in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw solid performance in our Big Kmart high frequency conversions, and were very pleased with the introduction of the new Martha Stewart Everyday bed and bath lines,&quot; Hall said.</p>
<p>&quot;Product-line extensions for Martha Stewart and the new offering of our Sesame Street line of children's apparel this summer are also expected to enhance our customer appeal, &quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kmart has 2,122 U.S. retail outlets and operates 123 stores internationally.</p>
<p>Its stock was unchanged at $14.50 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Gap Inc. reported higher earnings on an 11 percent increase in sales.</p>
<p>Gap, which operates 1,916 Gap, Banana Republic, GapKids and Old Navy stores, said earnings rose to $84.3 million, or 31 cents a share, from $81.6 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales rose to $1.23 billion from $1.11 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm pleased we can report improved earnings in what has been a difficult environment.  We are continuing to make progress toward our main objectives: building our brands and growing our businesses,&quot; said Millard S. Drexler, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>&quot;We have taken steps to strengthen our Gap brand, where we've had some short-term challenges,&quot; he said.  &quot;We named Robert Fisher to lead the division, and we returned to national television advertising with an exciting campaign aimed at our Gap brand target audience.&quot;</p>
<p>Gap's stock gained $1.50 to $33.625 on the NYSE.</p>
