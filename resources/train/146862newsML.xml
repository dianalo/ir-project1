<p>Spot wholesale electricity prices in the northeastern U.S. were flat to higher Monday from Friday's level amid tight short-term supply in the region, marketers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Things were pretty firm,&quot; said a Northeast trader.</p>
<p>The longer-than-expected outage of the 510 Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt., remained a strong support for spot prices in the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), said. marketers.</p>
<p>The restart of Vermont Yankee was postponed again, now to Tuesday from this past weekend as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission needed time to review the plant's fire protection data. The operator said it hoped to return the plant to service Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), peak, non-firm electricity for Tuesday at the Northeast Utilities border was discussed at $34.50-$35.50, flat from Friday's range for Monday delivery.</p>
<p>Non-firm, off-peak NEPOOL power for Tuesday delivery to the NU border was quoted at $19.50-$20.50, unchanged from Friday's quote for Monday.</p>
<p>In the New York Power Pool (NYPP) district, three nuclear units, with combined capacity over 2,400 MW, remained shut for either refueling or repairs.</p>
<p>The 800 MW Fitzpatrick and 1,137 MW Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear units, both in Scriba, N.Y., were idled for refueling, while 470 MW Ginna 1 nuclear station near the town of Ontario was shut for diagnostic tests on its transformer.</p>
<p>In western NYPP, peak, non-firm electricity for Tuesday was assessed near $24.00, up from Friday's $20.00-$21.00 for Monday delivery.</p>
<p>Western NYPP power for non-firm delivery during Tuesday's light load hours was pegged at $14.00-$15.00, flat from Friday.</p>
<p>In the eastern part of NYPP, peak, non-firm electricity for Tuesday delivery was valued at $29.00-$30.00, unchanged from Friday's range.</p>
<p>Off-peak, non-firm electricity for Tuesday in eastern NYPP was valued at $14.00-$15.00, a wider range than Friday's range of $14.50-$15.00.</p>
