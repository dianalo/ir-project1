<p>First half net profit at Dutch food group Nutricia NV is set to rise by more than 25 percent, with the firm benefiting from solid underlying growth and cost savings, analysts said.</p>
<p>They expect the group to post 1997 first half net on Thursday of between 126 and 159 million guilders, with a consensus of 135 million, up from 107 million last time.</p>
<p>Nutricia's profits soared 53 percent in 1996, boosted by bigger than expected savings at baby milk acquisition Milupa, but analysts said with integration of the firm now far advanced the potential for an upside earnings surprise had lessened.</p>
<p>&quot;Milupa is now pretty much digested, so I'm not looking for any major events at the half year,&quot; said Delta Lloyd Bank analyst Pieter van Gelder.</p>
<p>Van Gelder rates Nutricia a Buy and forecasts first half net profits of 137.3 million guilders. He said the company's own forecast of 12 to 20 percent higher net profits over the full year was cautious, and is looking for a 26 percent rise.</p>
<p>Nutricia has been one of the stars of the Dutch food and beverage sector, with solid free cash generation allowing it to continue to reduce its interest burden and to look for suitable acquisitions.</p>
<p>Analysts point to management's good track record with acquisitions and the group's solid and growing business in enteral clinical nutrition (ECN), foods given via the gastrointestinal tract to patients who cannot eat normally.</p>
<p>Further expansion is expected in the area of infant milk formula in emerging markets, in ECN and in neutraceuticals -- foods geared to have pharmaceutical effects, which are tipped as a new growth area in the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope they will find an acquisition soon, as they need that for further growth,&quot; said John David Roeg, analyst at Bank Labouchere.</p>
<p>Nutricia said in July it had called off talks to take a minority stake in Swedish vitamins and food supplements producer Vitamex.</p>
<p>Roeg rates Nutricia a Buy and is looking for first half profits of 135 million guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still integration benefits from Milupa which will be in the numbers, but there will be no surprise 50 percent rise this time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company's restructuring of its traditional dairy operations, targeted to raise margins from five percent now to eight percent by the end of 1998, would likely not have had time to feed through into the results, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are making progress in that area, but I don't think they will show it in this first half,&quot; he said. &quot;It's also possible they may sell that whole division at some time.&quot;</p>
