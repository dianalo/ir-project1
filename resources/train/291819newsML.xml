<p>Arab states plan to set up three factories to produce iron, steel and industrial refractory for a total cost of $1.4 billion, an Arab official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mohammed Karbid, general manager of the Rabat-based Arab Industrial Development &amp; Mining Organisation (AIDMO) said Arab financial institutions would finance these projects.</p>
<p>Karbid, speaking to reporters in Bahrain where he attended a two-day conference on petrochemicals in the Arab world, said studies were under way to build a $1 billion plant in Mauritania to produce four million tonnes of iron pellets a year.</p>
<p>AIDMO, owned by all Arab states, chose Mauritania because of huge reserves of more than one billion tonnes of raw material needed for the plant.</p>
<p>Karbid said AIDMO was studying plans to build a similar $300 million plant in the Gulf, possibly in Saudi Arabia, to produce between 200,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year.</p>
<p>The giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) has helped make the kingdom the biggest petrochemical producer in the Middle East.</p>
<p>SABIC, 70 percent owned by the Saudi government, accounts for around five percent of the world's total petrochemical output.</p>
<p>Karbid said AIDMO was also looking at plans to build a $120 million plant in Morocco to produce 300,000 tonnes a year of industrial refractory -- a substance mainly used in lining furnaces because of its ability to resist high temperatures.</p>
<p>He said work had already begun on another $320 million project in Egypt to manufacture special steel to produce around 275,000 tonnes a year.</p>
