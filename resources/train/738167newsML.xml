<p>U.S. stock index futures ended sharply lower and near the session lows, with September S&amp;Ps down more than 20.0 points, after a deep selloff across equity sectors.</p>
<p>September S&amp;P 500 futures tumbled in the final half-hour, collapsing after a recovery attempt in the afternoon failed. The contract carved a new session low of 916.00 in the final minutes of trading.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 130 points lower at 7890 and the Nasdaq Composite shed almost 21 to end near 1548.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P traders said a retreat in the heady technology sector, especially in Microsoft Corp shares, was the catalyst as equity investors finally took some profits.</p>
<p>&quot;We were long overdue for a break,&quot; said one S&amp;P floor analyst.</p>
<p>Microsoft late Thursday released fiscal fourth-quarter results that were in line with analysts' average forecast but disappointing to those looking for the company to outperform once again.  </p>
<p>&quot;People were looking for bigger and bigger surprises,&quot; said the S&amp;P analyst.</p>
<p>Microsoft said its fourth-quarter earnings were 80 cents per share, one cent above the First Call estimate and up from 43 cents in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>The company's stock ended down 9 at 140-1/2.</p>
<p>September S&amp;Ps' losses accelerated in the first hour of the session, sending the contract plunging the 15-point initial trading limit at 0909 CDT.</p>
<p>Traders said futures hit sell stops at 932.00 and 930.00, then declined in a vacuum to 925.00 before reaching the limit.  </p>
<p>After 15 minutes, the 15-point restriction was lifted, according to exchange rules, because bids surfaced to lift the contract slightly.</p>
<p>However, S&amp;Ps subsequently resumed their slide, losing more than 20 points before stabilizing.</p>
<p>The contract attempted a comeback in the late afternoon as arbitrageurs unwound sell programs, floor traders said, but the bottom fell out in the dash to the close.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P 500 futures ended down 20.95 points at 917.00, Nasdaq 100s down 26.75 at 1080.75, Russell 2000s down 4.75 at 408.50, Nikkei 225 index futures down 285.0 at 20,220.0 and Midcap 400s down 2.95 at 304.40.</p>
