<p>The U.S. State Department urged Congress on Wednesday to remove controversial provisions on Jerusalem from bills it is currently considering, saying they were &quot;not good foreign policy&quot;.</p>
<p>Spokesman Nicholas Burns said that, while it was too early to talk of a White House veto, President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would have to look &quot;very carefully&quot; at the measures if they went through unchanged.</p>
<p>Foreign affairs bills passed this month by the House of Representatives and the Senate contain provisions that would shift Washington closer to formal recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move the administration says is premature.</p>
<p>The two bills, which also deal with merging independent foreign affairs agencies into the State Department and paying off arrears to the United Nations, have to be combined in a single version before passing to Clinton for signature.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope very much that this particular provision (on Jerusalem) will not end up in a final piece of legislation that the president will have to sign or not sign,&quot; Burns told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;So, I don't want to threaten a veto at this point for one reason. We hope that this amendment will be taken off the bill before it reaches the final stage of consideration in conference,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If it does come to that, obviously the president and the secretary of state will have to look at that very, very carefully.&quot;</p>
<p>While most of Congress supports Israel's view that Jerusalem is the &quot;undivided capital&quot; of the Jewish state, the administration believes the city's status is an issue still to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been very clear ... that Jerusalem is the most emotional, the most complex issue that the Israelis and Palestinians will negotiate in the permanent status talks,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not believe it's wise or appropriate or good policy to prejudge that issue and to take initiatives which, in effect, move that issue in a certain direction before the parties to the conflict have even had a chance to discuss it themselves,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;So, why in the world would we as a country, want to interfere with their agreement? That's the best way I can describe our opposition to this amendment.&quot;</p>
<p>Congress two years ago passed an act requiring that the U.S. embassy in Israel should be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by May 1999, although it allowed Clinton to suspend the move for six-month periods.</p>
<p>Last week, in a move widely criticised in the Arab world, the House allocated funds for establishing an embassy in Jerusalem and directed the State Department to name Israel's capital as Jerusalem in all its publications.</p>
