<p>			    -----oOo-----</p>
<p>Trading for the week ended on a cautious note, with a gain of 18.55 points (0.01 percent) at 3876.04 levels over the previous week. The market commenced the week on a strong note, but the higher levels (4029.56) could not be maintained due to off-loading of speculative postions.</p>
<p>At 4029.56 levels, the Sensex has corrected the decline of 1418.10 points (4131.22 to 2713.12) by 92.83 percent.

<p>The correctionary trend in Ashok Leyland, Asian, BSES, Grasim, ITC, L&amp;T, SCICI, Siemen &amp; Tata Chemicals are indicating losing momentum on the weekly chart. These counter may seek lower values in the initial half of the week, but may witness buying interest in due course and may probably close the week on a strong note. The best trading opportunity for the week's trading is to be on the long side from Tuesday with a stop-loss of 3742 levels.</p>
<p>The price following oscillators on the weekly bar chart are exhibiting that the bottom may be formed at 3810-3765 levels -Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 68.07 Price Rate of Change (ROC)is placed at 37.15, short term stochastic is hovering at 76.70 and its trigger line is at 64.56, while the medium term stochastic is 78.61 and the trigger is 74.09, the Macd is 86.43 and the tigger is 2.90 and the 14 Williams percent R is placed at -11.6.
