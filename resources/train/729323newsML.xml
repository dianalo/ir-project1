<p>CBOT soyoil futures ended sharply higher on Tuesday, lifted by forecasts for hot, dry weather in the U.S. Midwest with old crop up on a correction from Monday's weak performance, traders said.</p>
<p>Soymeal ended mixed with some new crop months up weather.</p>
<p>&quot;It's probably just a correction in the product values on ideas the oil had been left behind more than was warranted,&quot; said Mario Balletto, analyst with Merrill Lynch. &quot;Fundamentally, there's nothing in terms of anything new.&quot;</p>
<p>Meteorologists forecast a week of hot, dry weather for the U.S. Midwest with no rains expected until Friday.</p>
<p>Persistent hot, dry summer weather can cause heat and moisture stress, cutting yield potential, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said the market ignored bearish long-term forecasts by the National Weather Service. The NWS six- to 10-day outlook called for above normal rainfall and normal to below normal temperatures for much of the Midwest July 20-24.</p>
<p>Soymeal ended $3.00 per ton lower to $0.50 higher with August down $3.00 at $251.90 a ton. Soyoil closed 0.46 to 0.30 cent per lb with August up 0.36 at 22.79 cents.</p>
<p>Commercials were noted buyers of soyoil. Traders said Produce Grain bought 1,200 lots soyoil on the day.  </p>
<p>ADM and Cargill Inc sold 400 lots each, traders said.</p>
<p>In soymeal, Merrill Lynch sold 300 lots December and 100 August and bought 200 December. Cargill Inc bought 300 August and 100 December while Term Commodities sold 300 August.</p>
<p>Soymeal volume was estimated by CBOT at 28,000 lots, compared with Monday's actual volume of 24,406 lots. Soyoil volume was pegged at 25,000 lots, against Monday's 23,485.</p>
