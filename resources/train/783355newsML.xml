<p>British building society-turned-bank Woolwich Plc on Wednesday released its first set of results as a publicly-listed company, with first-half, pre-tax profits slightly above analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>Woolwich reported pre-tax profits for the first half of the year of 187.8 million pounds, compared with 183.1 million pounds for the same period in 1996. The headline figure, excluding the exceptional cost of conversion, was up 13 percent at 215 million pounds.  </p>
<p>Woolwich, which shed a 150-year mutual tradition when it floated on the stock exchange on July 7, said it would pay an interim dividend of 3.0 pence per share, slightly above forecasts of 2.8-2.9 pence. Analysts had forecast the pre-tax profits in a range of 180 to 185 million pounds ($300.5 million).</p>
<p>&quot;This is our first set of results since becoming a listed company and it is very pleasing to be able not only to report profits that exceed the forecast in the listing particulars but also to pay our new shareholders their first dividend in October,&quot; Woolwich chief executive John Stewart said.</p>
<p>Woolwich said it recognised the increasingly competitive nature of the British personal financial services market and its continuing review of costs and operating processes was expected to contribute to further improvement in its cost to income ratio.</p>
<p>&quot;The Woolwich is determined to strengthen its position as a leading provider of personal financial services and is confident that by anticipating customers' needs and offering them cost-effective products and services to meet those needs, it will continue to increase shareholder value,&quot; it said. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)</p>
