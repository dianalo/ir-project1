<p>Congressional leaders agreed Thursday on two important health care reforms to expand insurance coverage for mental health and allow new mothers to stay in the hospital at least 48 hours after childbirth.</p>
<p>The reforms will put an end nationwide to &quot;drive-through deliveries&quot;-- hospitals that force women to leave with their infants sometimes as soon as 10 hours after a normal delivery.</p>
<p>The two health insurance changes are to be added to a must-pass spending bill providing money for federal housing programmes, veterans' health care, environmental protection and space research. Both will take effect Jan. 1, 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;This bill will require insurance companies to allow up to 48 hours when women go to the hospital for a normal birth and 96 hours in the hospital for women who have a Caesarean section,&quot; said Sen. Bill Bradley, a sponsor of the maternal health insurance reform.</p>
<p>To cut costs in recent years many insurance plans limited coverage to 24 hours or even less for a normal birth and 48 hours for a Caesarean-section. Women and doctors protested that not all women were ready to be discharged so quickly.</p>
<p>Bradley credited a unified front of outraged doctors and the public with forcing Congress to accept the change. The insurance industry was divided on the issue with major health plans such as Kaiser Permanente supporting the change. The New Jersey Democrat said he received 84,000 letters on the issue.</p>
<p>The expansion of mental health coverage was expected to benefit 75 million Americans with group health insurance and those covered by government-funded Medicaid. While health plans will not be required to cover mental illness, those that do will no longer be permitted to set lower maximum payment amounts for mental health treatment.</p>
<p>If the health plan has no lifetime limit on physical care, none will be permitted on mental health care. The compromise exempts companies with 50 or fewer employees, rather than 25 or fewer employees as sponsors had wanted.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Republican Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico fought side-by-side for the mental health changes. Wellstone told reporters it would raise premiums by only a fraction of a percent.</p>
<p>Both provisions passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support but had not cleared the House, where Democrats this week forced a non-binding vote endorsing the Senate plan.</p>
<p>Some Republicans in the House said Thursday they would seek to change both next year, but as one Democratic Senate aide pointed out, President Clinton would not sign into law any bill rolling back either provision.</p>
<p>A third health issue remained unresolved. The Senate had sought to provide veterans' health benefits to children born with the birth defect spina bifida. There have been studies linking the defect to Agent Orange exposure of fathers who served in Vietnam.</p>
