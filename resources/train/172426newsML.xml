<p>Polish shares inched up 0.2 percent after Wednesday's surge and analysts said the dominant selling on price-fixing signalled a fall on Friday and a possible subsequent flat trend.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't want to buy whenever there's a big gain, like after yesterday,&quot; said Remigiusz Tarka of IB Austria Securities, referring to the 3.1-percent jump buoyed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's successful heart operation.</p>
<p>But some analysts said large investors might continue recent buying of large-cap stocks, heartened that the government might soon clear up disagreement on 1997 tax bills. </p>
<p>They said good news was the Senate legislative committee's rejection on Thursday of the tax cut for low earners proposed by the lower house last week, seen as inflationary. The whole Senate votes on the issue next week.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index inched up 0.2 percent to 13,919.8 points and turnover fell 25.3 percent to 89.3 million zlotys on both markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said biggest loser Mostostal Zabrze fell 9.9 percent as some investors feared the profit dilution from their forthcoming share issue, but that the low 0.6-million-zloty turnover signalled a possible rebound soon. </p>
<p>Continuous trade turnover was at 1.9 million zlotys with biggest mover Rolimpex down 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>NFI units were flat at 142.5 zlotys in a 10.2-million-zloty turnover in the regular bourse session and fell 3.4 percent in 9.4-million-zloty continuous trade.</p>
