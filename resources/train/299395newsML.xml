<title>USA: Zinc mating season continues, minor deal settled.</title>

<p>Although courting in the annual zinc concentrates mating season is being extended until the American Zinc Association meeting in Scottsdale early February, Morocco's Guemassa mine appears to have settled a significant quantity of material for 1997 delivery, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Guemassa, operated by Casablanca-based Omnium Nord Africain and BRPM, was said to have sold some 90,000 tonnes of concentrates to two smelters in Italy and Spain, ENI and Asturiana de Zinc respectively at treatment charges (TCs) in the &quot;low $170s per tonne Antwerp equivalent&quot; with an LME basis price of $1,000 per tonne, according to European industry sources.</p>
<p>However, several zinc mining and smelting officials said they were not aware of any major benchmark deals between the Australian miners and Japanese and Korean smelters, or between Canadian miners and European smelters yet.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion it looks like the benchmark is going to settle anywhere between $170 and $175 per tonne, therefore it (the Guemassa deal) could become quite representative,&quot; a concs trader said. &quot;But none of the majors like Cominco would consider Guemassa a benchmark deal.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Guemassa deal was a direct agreement between miner and smelter, and not a trader deal.</p>
<p>Last year's TCs were settled at about $190 per tonne, therefore the Guemassa deal would represent a sharp gain for the miners as they pay less to the smelters.</p>
<p>Miners are arguing that the closure of much mining capacity, led by Anvil Range's Faro, will cut the amount of concentrates available to smelters this year.</p>
<p>The market was also awaiting the outcome of Hindustan Zinc's tender for 30,000 tonnes of zinc concentrates. Two or three traders were still in the race.</p>
<p>In lead, although some deals for 1997 have been concluded in Europe at about $2 per tonne above 1996 TCs of $170-$175, negotiators were said to be holding back and hoping to settle the benchmark deals along with zinc at the AZA conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We would have thought it would be much easier to settle in lead, but most people who deal in lead also deal in zinc and want to combine everything,&quot; a European smelter official said.</p>
