<headline>Russian shares shrug off cabinet appointments.</headline>

<p>Leading Russian were almost unchanged on Monday as operators ignored new government appointments and said the changes had been built into prices.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 23 shares edged up by 0.3 percent to 330.38 on $30.62 million on total market volume.</p>
<p>Energy utility UES  closed at $0.2255 after $0.2256 at Friday's close. Gazprom natural gas monopoly closed unchanged on $0.655.</p>
<p>Regional power utility Lenenergo turned in the best performance for the day, rising to $0.945 from $0.87.</p>
<p>&quot;All the recent good news has been priced in since Chubais was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister, although today's names are very attractive for clients,&quot; said Pavel Gronbjerg, head corporate securities trader at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin appointed Boris Nemtsov, a liberal reformist governor of Nizhny Novgorod as First Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as saying that First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais had been appointed Finance Minister.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin said on television Alfred Kokh, head of the State Property Fund, had been appointed Deputy Prime Minister and privatisation minister.</p>
<p>He said Yakov Urinson, a deputy economy minister, had been promoted to Economy Minister and Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The Kokh and Urinson appointments were announced after markets closed.</p>
<p>Some traders said there could be slight growth on the new appointments but many said reformers' appointment had already been priced into the market.</p>
<p>Western investors were waiting for results of the Russia-U.S. summit in Helsinki on March 20-21 and a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan on March 19, some said.</p>
<p>But Rinaco-Plus head of corporate securities trading Andrei Kukk said the market had also priced in the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;All possible outcomes of Yelsin and (U.S. President Bill) Clinton negotiations have already been taken in,&quot; Kukk said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the instability we have seen recently is no news for anyone. Everyone who wanted to take profits has done it, everyone who was scared by NATO talks has already closed his positions or reshuffled into other projects.&quot;</p>
<p>He said a broad reaction would wait until the new reformers had a chance to prove themselves.</p>
