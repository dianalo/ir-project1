<headline>LIFFE to review coffee grading terms after row.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The London International Financial Futures (LIFFE) said it would review its new quality-grading criteria for robusta coffee following complaints from the trade.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the exchange sent a circular to members spelling out the terms of reference for the review. But it stressed that it was likely to be several months before the results of the review were known.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it would continue to grade all coffee samples against the current quality specifications, and in particular would continue to apply the defect count currently attributable to mouldy beans.</p>
<p>LIFFE said the members had voiced concerns that the new criteria, and in particular the application of a specific defect count for mouldy beans, &quot;has increased the amount of coffee that is currently being graded as non-tenderable&quot;.</p>
<p>The change in the grading rules was announced by the then-London Commodity Exchange in March 1996 after extensive consultation with the market.</p>
<p>The changes take effect with the July 1997 delivery contract onwards.</p>
<p>The changes relate to the adjustments of bands of defects and the allowances awarded with regard to defects, the introduction of a moisture tolerance for deliverable coffee, and the introduction of a specific defect count of 50 for mouldy beans.</p>
<p>The moisture tolerance criterion was subsequently suspended until an appropriate method has been found to test for this requirement.</p>
<p>But the main complaint revolves around the introduction of a defect count for mouldy beans.</p>
<p>Under the old rules, examination for mould was a subjective process, but the new regulations have introduced a measure of objectivity.</p>
<p>Traders said the new grading criteria had resulted in an alarmingly high failure rate of 72 percent this month.</p>
<p>So far this month, 4,967 lots have been put up for grading, of which 1,391 have passed and 3,576 have failed.</p>
<p>The overall failure rate was around 47 percent in May.</p>
<p>LIFFE said in the circular that the new rules were introduced to reflect the changes in the underlying physical market, widen the bands of acceptable coffee and increase the delivery base.</p>
<p>It said it was very important to treat mould as a serious defect in order to take full account of the growing concern relating to the level of ochrotoxins contained in coffee mould.</p>
