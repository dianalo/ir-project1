<p>New Zealand opposition Labour leader Helen Clark said on Wednesday she would not lead a government which would &quot;dismantle&quot; the Reserve Bank Act after next month's general election.</p>
<p>Labour and the other two main opposition parties, economic nationalist New Zealand First and the left-wing Alliance, are together drawing just above 50 percent support, with the conservative National Party in the mid- to high-thirties.  </p>
<p>Labour introduced the Reserve Bank Act in 1989 and is commited to the single objective in the Act of price stability, but would widen the target underlying inflation range from 0-2 percent to minus one to three.</p>
<p>But both the Alliance and New Zealand First want to widen the Act's objectives to include growth, and in the Alliance's case jobs as well.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Clark said she wanted to lead a social democratic government after the October 12 election.  </p>
<p>&quot;I see Labour pursuing a social democratic approach to economic management which is different (from the current government). It may not require a whole lot of different legislation, but it will require a different approach recognising there are a range of levers and assessing all government policy for their contribution to the objectives we are trying to reach.&quot;</p>
<p>In her strongest statement yet on the Act, she said: &quot;I have no intention of leading a government which would dismantle the Reserve Bank Act.&quot;  </p>
<p>Would a minority Labour government rely on the right to support its economic policy and the left to advance its social agenda?</p>
<p>&quot;That is putting it far too crudely.  There are economic policies that will change. For example in fighting inflation, which I think is important, you need more than just the tools of the Reserve Bank Act. We are looking to government to be rather more active in a range of areas to ease inflationary pressures.&quot;  </p>
<p>She said upskilling the workforce was one measure, but she rejected the reform recipe outlined by Reserve Bank governor Don Brash. In a speech in London in June Brash said there was scope for further privatisation and reforms in health, education and income support.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not into that at all,&quot; Clark said.</p>
<p>She said Labour was commited to running small surpluses.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to look again in a couple of weeks at the pre-election economic and fiscal update (to be released by Treasury on September 12) and what implications that has for the sequence of our policy.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are not proposing to run a whole sequence of deficit budgets. The idea is to keep them in balance over the cycle and that may mean you look at the phasing of policy.&quot;</p>
<p>She said recent predictions of nil growth in the economy by brokers Ord Minnett were &quot;a bit pessimistic&quot;. &quot;Their forecast of no growth drew heavily on record negatives in business confidence, which have bounced back again.&quot;</p>
<p>Clark added: &quot;Labour's priority is reinvestment in the social area. We do want to keep a debt repayment programme going but it will be at a lower level.  </p>
<p>&quot;A critical difference is National has signalled that year after year after year it will look at tax cuts. If Labour is elected the tax cuts next year will not go ahead and a fresh set of cuts will be tabled,&quot; she said.</p>
