<p>Kunming Department Store (Group) Co Ltd opened a new flagship store in Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, on Thursday, the Shenzhen-based Securities Times said on Friday.</p>
<p>The five-floor 20,500-sq-metre new store in downtown Kunming has double the space of its former retail building in the city and will greatly help 1997 performance, it said.</p>
<p>The firm will also invest 400 million yuan in a 22-floor four-star hotel on top of the new store, it said but gave no timetable for the hotel project.</p>
<p>In an annual report, the firm said it had after-tax profits of 17.92 million yuan last year, against 29.78 million in 1994.</p>
<p>It blamed the drop in net earnings for 1995 on the effects of an explosion in its flagship department store on January 14 last year, which a company spokesman said cut more than 10 million yuan off the firm's profits in 1995.</p>
<p>He said that an investigation revealed that two bombs had been set off by a pair of suspects, causing serious property damage, killing one person and injuring 90. He said that insurance claims filed for the damage had long gone unpaid.</p>
<p>The company reported net earnings of 5.55 million yuan for the first half of 1996 against 7.06 million a year earlier.</p>
