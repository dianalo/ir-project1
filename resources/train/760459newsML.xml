<p>Chrysler Corp. said Monday it will spend $1.2 billion on a new Jeep assembly plant and existing Jeep facilities in Toledo, Ohio, ending months of speculation about the future of Jeep production there.</p>
<p>Chrysler said a deal with state and local officials calls for it to build a new 1.1 million-square-foot assembly plant adjacent to its existing Stickney Avenue Plant in Toledo. The project also includes refurbishment of an existing 290,000-square-foot building on the Stickney site as well as improvements to Chrysler's nearby Jeep Parkway plant.  </p>
<p>The investment ensures the future of the sprawling Jeep complex, Toledo's largest employer, which builds the Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler sport utility vehicles. Parts of the current factories date back to 1910, making them some of the oldest operating auto plants in the world.</p>
<p>Chrysler said the new and refurbished plants will continue to build Jeep sport utility vehicles, but it intends to do so with fewer workers. Employment at the new facilities is expected to drop to 4,900 people from about 5,400 currently through retirement and attrition.</p>
<p>&quot;Our major consideration was to have a new manufacturing facility that would allow us to retain our current outstanding Toledo workforce, and capitalise on their continuous commitment to building world-class products,&quot; Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chrysler said it will spend about $600 million on the new assembly plant and related machinery, construction of which is scheduled to start in 1998. The other $600 million will be spent on renovations and upgrades. Vehicle production at the new facility is slated to start in 2001.</p>
