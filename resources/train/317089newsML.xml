<p>A bomb exploded outside a courthouse in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Saturday, killing at least 12 people, including the leader of a militant Sunni Moslem group, police and doctors said.</p>
<p>They said 68 others were wounded as the bomb, apparently left on a motorcycle, went off at about 12.30 p.m. (0730 GMT) when Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) group leader Zia-ur-Rahman Faruqi and his deputy, Azam Tariq, arrived at the court.</p>
<p>Faruqi, SSP Patron-in-Chief, died in hospital while Tariq was seriously wounded, doctors said.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said most of the casualties were policemen, journalists, lawyers or SSP supporters who had gathered to scatter flowers over their leaders.</p>
<p>The two were due to appear before the Sessions Court in central Lahore, capital of Punjab province, on charges of involvement in sectarian killings of minority Shi'ite Moslems.</p>
<p>Shi'ites form about 15 percent of Pakistan's predominantly Sunni population of over 130 million but are the majority in neighbouring Iran.</p>
<p>The bomb appeared to be the latest move in a long-running feud between militant Sunnis and Shi'ites that cost more than 40 lives last year in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The secretary of Iran's National Security Council, Hassan Rowhani, urged the Pakistani government on Thursday to mount a &quot;crackdown on terrorist groups in Pakistan and (prevent) the assassination of Shi'ite Moslems&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The groups not only endanger Pakistan's security but also hamper the unity of Moslems,&quot; Rowhani, a Shi'ite cleric,  told visiting Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahibzada Yaqoob Khan.</p>
<p>Shi'ite militancy in Pakistan was fuelled by the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran,  sparking a fierce backlash from well-armed Sunni groups such as the SSP.</p>
<p>Two Shi'ite leaders were killed in separate incidents in Pakistan on December 31 and a Shi'ite activist was shot dead on Monday.</p>
<p>Sunni-Shi'ite disputes over Islamic beliefs have often spilled into violence in Pakistan. There has been a wave of such incidents in recent months in Punjab and North West Frontier province in which many people have died.</p>
