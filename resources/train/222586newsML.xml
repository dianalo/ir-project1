<p>Yugoslavia's M1 money supply rose 6.6 percent in October and topped 4.9 billion dinars ($973.8 million), the Belgrade-based Institute for Market Research (IZIT) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The structure of the M1 money supply was unfavourable at the end of October because currency in circulation accounted for almost 47 percent and deposits made up the remaining 53 percent of M1, IZIT said in its regular monthly report.</p>
<p>From April to October M1 rose by a total of 45.7 percent, or 5.5 percent per month on the average. Retail prices marked a 21.5 percent cummulative rise over the same period, or 2.8 percent per month, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong increase in M1 money supply began in April but was partly backed by growth in industrial production and gross domestic product, as well as by hard currency held on companies' bank accounts abroad,&quot; IZIT economist Slobodan Milosavljevic told Reuters.</p>
<p>M1 money supply continued its steep rise despite recent increase of the reserve requirement to 15 from 10 percent for commercial banks, Milosavljevic said.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that the five percent increase (in the reserve requirement) was necessary because its steep surge could have led to banks' lending activity overheating and posed a threat to the dinar and price stability,&quot; Milosavljevic said.</p>
<p>Commercial banks lending activity rose 2.4 percent in October to 9.7 billion dinars. From April to October, overall credit activity of the banking sector jumped by 49.2 percent, IZIT said.</p>
<p>Another IZIT survey showed that banks strongly criticised the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) measures aimed at curbing money supply.</p>
<p>&quot;Bankers mostly baulk at the NBY measures saying the NBY only uses two (key) aggregates -- discount rate and the reserve requirement -- instead of introducing other measures and combining them more effectively,&quot; Milosavljevic said. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
