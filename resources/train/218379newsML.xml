<headline>Bonn to let big firms adopt IAS accounting rules.</headline>

<p>The German government plans to allow globally active companies to report their consolidated group results exclusively under International Accounting Standards (IAS), a government official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bonn will in December approve a draft law which should come into force in 1997, Herbert Biener, a senior civil servant in the justice ministry, told a conference organised by accountants KPMG Deutsche Treuhand and the German stock exchange, Deutsche Boerse AG.</p>
<p>Firms without global ambitions will for the time being have to continue reporting under the German Commercial Code (HGB) but IAS is likely to become the norm eventually, Biener said.</p>
<p>Several large German companies, among them Deutsche Bank AG and Daimler-Benz AG, have already adopted internationally-accepted accounting standards but still have to file separate accounts under HGB -- a costly business which has so far prevented many major firms from following suit.</p>
<p>The justice ministry' plans are part of a host of government measures in recent years to make German companies and financial markets more attractive to foreign investors.</p>
<p>Bringing German accounting into line with international standards would make it easier for firms here to obtain capital in increasingly competitive global markets.</p>
<p>Biener said companies reporting group results under IAS would not have to file accounts under HGB rules, although the accounts must still satisfy the requirements of existing German and European Union guidelines.</p>
<p>The IAS accounts will have to be written in German and reveal at least as much about the company as HGB accounts would, Biener said.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that by 1999 companies throughout Europe will be reporting under internationally accepted standards,&quot; Biener said. &quot;Double accounts under HGB and IAS have no future.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of the current drive towards encouraging shareholder value in Germany, many market commentators have urged the introduction of IAS or U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to allow increased transparency.</p>
<p>Deutsche's switch to IAS, for example, led to the disclosure of about 20 billion marks ($13.1 billion) of previously hidden reserves.</p>
<p>Separately on Tuesday, the justice ministry unveiled a draft share law aimed at increasing the power of small shareholders by easing rules on share buybacks and limiting banks' exercise of proxies on shares deposited with them.</p>
