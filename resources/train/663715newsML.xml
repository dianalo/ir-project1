<p>Italy said on Monday its ambassador and embassy staff had been evacuated by French forces from the Congo Republic because of fighting in the capital Brazzaville.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry statement said the zone around the embassy had become a &quot;theatre of violent fighting between rival factions&quot; and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini had authorised the evacuation of staff to neighbouring Gabon.</p>
<p>&quot;The embassy personnel, 13 people in all, were today evacuated by the French forces who are leaving the country at the end of an operation to evacuate foreigners,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Italian ambassador, Fausto Pennacchio, moved temporarily to Libreville in Gabon.</p>
<p>French troops have evacuated more than 5,000 foreign nationals caught up in a bloody political and ethnic dispute in its former colony in central Africa.</p>
<p>France is pressing ahead with the withdrawal of its soldiers despite an appeal from Congo President Pascal Lissouba to leave troops in the city as a buffer between the army and militiamen loyal to former military leader Denis Sassou Nguesso.</p>
