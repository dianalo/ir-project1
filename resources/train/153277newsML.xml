<headline>Lima bolsa closes lower on foreigners' absence.</headline>
<dateline>LIMA 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lima stocks fell moderately Wednesday for the third consecutive session on an absence of foreign investors, brokers said.</p>
<p>They predicted that the downward tilt due to the lack of foreign capital would end next week in a natural market cycle.</p>
<p>&quot;The prices of local stocks are attractive, but there is an almost total absence of foreign capital,&quot; said Luis Calderon of Acciones y Valores brokerage.</p>
<p>In Wednesday's session, the General Index  dropped a nominal 1.26 percent to 1,519.24 points, while the blue-chip Selective Index  fell 1.27 percent to 2,098.60.  </p>
<p>According to Luis Cueva of Argos brokerage house, the fall in the Mexican peso, which is hurting that country's bolsa, is also having an impact in other regional markets such as the Peruvian exchange.</p>
<p>During the session, a total of 35.8 million soles ($13.9 million) was traded in 1,608 trades, an improvement from prior days. Of the 92 stocks traded, 43 fell, 34 remained flat and 15 increased.</p>
<p>Benchmark Telefnica del Per accounted for 34 percent of total market volume with 2.2 million of stocks traded. It fell 1.28 percent to close at 5.58 soles.  </p>
<p>Among leaders, brewery Backus y Johnston posted the largest increase, up 0.78 percent to 2.60 soles, with a total trade of 460,000 shares.</p>
<p>Ice-cream and confectionery manufacturer D'Onofrio's volatile stock had the largest fall, ending off 7.38 percent to 1.13 soles on 70,000 shares.</p>
