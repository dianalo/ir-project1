<p>CME live cattle futures were expected to open steady to up 0.100 cent per lb on Tuesday while feeder cattle were called steady to off 0.100 cent, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Expectations that packers will continue to bid at least $67 per cwt for fed cattle and a firmer tone to boxed beef should support live cattle futures, analysts said.</p>
<p>They cited reports of good weekend beef clearance which may ecourage stepped up packer interest. There also could be increased retailer interest for beef this week to fill needs for expected first of the month featuring, they said.  </p>
<p>However, trading activity could again be light as the market awaits actual cash cattle sales, they said.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures will likely be under pressure following the sharp break in the latest CME feeder cattle index. Even though the break in the index had been anticipated and in the market after Friday's futures break, it is still large enough to weigh on sentiment and likely overshadow indications for lower corn futures, they added.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was off $1.31 to $76.33 per cwt.</p>
