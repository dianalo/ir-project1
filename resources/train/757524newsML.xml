<p>A dozen black deckhands who brought a bias suit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have accepted a settlement including $1.2 million in compensation and promotions, the government said Friday.</p>
<p>The settlement also covered four retired black workers from the Hurley, a Memphis-based dredging boat, and its predecessor, the Burgess. Two of the workers have since died.</p>
<p>Two white supervisors on the Hurley will be transferred to other posts, one a training and advising programme for the promoted deckhands, Army Corps spokesman Jim Pogue said.</p>
<p>&quot;I needed to clean the atmosphere on the dredge,&quot; Col. Gregory Bean, head of the Army Corps' Memphis District, told Reuters. He said he wanted to remove any possibility that disciplinary actions would be perceived as retaliation for the settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;My goal, and the goal of this settlement, is to clearly foster a workplace that values, appreciates and believes in the dignity of every individual,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Managers in the district will get leadership training, and all employees will receive cultural diversity training.</p>
<p>The Pentagon, which oversees the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, its engineering and construction arm, issued a report earlier this year that criticised racial attitudes on the dredging boats, Bean said.</p>
<p>In interviews with The New York Times, one of the black deckhands characterised conditions on the Hurley as &quot;modern-day slavery,&quot; and another said he was viewed as a &quot;houseboy.&quot;</p>
<p>The black deckhands worked only during the dredging season, from mid-June to early November, when the Hurley covered hundreds of miles of the Mississippi River, clearing the channel bottom. Only white deckhands had full-time jobs maintaining the boat during the off-season, and they earned more.</p>
