<p>Japan's top printer maker Canon Inc is expected to unveil record annual profits this week, helped by the global boom in personal computers, and analysts say its earnings will keep on rising.</p>
<p>Canon, also known for its cameras, is due to announce its parent company business results for 1996 on Wednesday and its group results on February 19.</p>
<p>Analysts said the weaker yen should help maintain the momentum that pushed its profits up sharply in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's profit will likely continue its upward trend this year on robust exports and sales of office equipment,&quot; said Noboru Machida, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.</p>
<p>The bullish profit outlook has fuelled demand for Canon shares despite overall gloom on the Tokyo stock market, pushing the shares to a lifetime high of 2,650 yen on January 29.</p>
<p>A solid performance as a multinational company has made Canon a prime choice for global investors who have been hunting so-called &quot;Nifty Fifty&quot; blue chips in Japan. On Monday, Canon shares were trading at around 2,590 yen in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Company officials have said Canon is heading for record annual profits in 1996 for the second consecutive year.</p>
<p>A Canon spokesman told Reuters earlier this month that the company would post a parent current profit of 125 billion yen ($1.02 billion) for the business year to December 31, 1996, up 56 percent from the previous year. Current profit is pre-tax and includes losses or gains on investments.</p>
<p>He also said the company expects parent sales to have grown 13 percent year-on-year to about 1.4 trillion yen ($11.4 billion), mainly due to a 22 percent rise in sales of computer peripherals, including printers.</p>
<p>Helped by the boom in popularity of personal computers, its sales of computer peripherals in 1996 accounted for more than half the total for the first time, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed with the record-profit scenario and said Canon would see profits rising further this year.</p>
<p>Satoshi Hirachi, an analyst at Daiwa Research Institute, said new models of bubble-jet printers would stimulate demand for home-use printers, while laser-jet printers, which are mainly used in offices, continue to sell briskly.</p>
<p>&quot;The introduction of new personal computers with multimedia functions will likely create demand for new printers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But analysts warn that sales of steppers -- machines used to make chips -- will likely decline in 1997 due to a plunge in memory chip prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the deterioration of demand for chip-making equipment begun around August of last year, its full impact will be on this year's business performance,&quot; said Hirachi.</p>
<p>Sales of cameras, Canon's other main business area, are likely to decline from last year, as the impact of the introduction of a new compact-camera format called the advanced photo system (APS) wears off.</p>
<p>Analysts said although Canon should continue to hold the largest market share for APS cameras, with about 40 percent, sales are unlikely to grow much more.</p>
<p>Hirachi said the weaker yen will continue to buoy Canon's earnings as exports account for about 80 percent of revenues.</p>
<p>Canon said it expects the weaker yen to have increased its export income by 60 billion yen ($491 million) in 1996 by increasing sales and revenues from exports.</p>
<p>Machida predicted Canon's parent current profit in 1997 would be about 132 billion to 133 billion yen (around $1.09 billion). Hirachi predicted 145 billion yen ($1.18 billion).</p>
<p>Canon plans to pay an annual dividend of 15 yen for 1996, including two yen to mark its 60th anniversary. ($1=122 yen)</p>
