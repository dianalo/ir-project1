<p>Economic sentiment in the European Union showed a noticeable upturn in January, led by improving expectations among consumers and industry, the European Commission said on Monday.</p>
<p>In its monthly review of economic conditions within the 15-nation bloc, the EU's executive found that its so-called sentiment index rose to 100.3 in January from 99.8 in December.</p>
<p>The latest increase put the index above its 1996 average of 98.9 and more in line with the average seen in 1995 at 101.0.</p>
<p>A sharp improvement in expectations was seen in Germany while France's economic barometer remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The index, comprised of confidence measures from industry, consumers and the construction sector, also remained steady for Britain.</p>
<p>The construction area was the only area which showed a deterioration in confidence, pulled down by a poor outlook for employment growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, preliminary figures showed the index for capacity utilisation in manufacturing edged down slightly in January to 80.7 from 81.0 in December. The capacity index averaged 81.2 in 1996 and 83.0 in 1995.</p>
