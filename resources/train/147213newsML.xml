<p>Poland will have to double its current spending on military modernisation to meet its future NATO obligations, President Aleksander Kwasniewski said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a need, over the five years from 1998 to 2002, at least to double spending for modernisation of the army if we are to be a serious partner for NATO structures,&quot; Kwasniewski told an annual conference of Polish military chiefs in Warsaw.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a sum of eight billion zlotys ($2.85 billion),&quot; public television showed him telling the conference.</p>
<p>He later told a news conference that one approach could be to create a special modernisation fund for the forces.</p>
<p>Poland earmarked nearly eight billion zlotys for defence this year out of total 1996 budget spending of 111.6 billion zlotys.</p>
<p>The government is just about to submit proposals for next year's budget.</p>
<p>Although parliament last year adopted a resolution calling for defence spending to be increased to three percent of gross domestic product by 1997, Kwasniewski said this goal would be beyond Poland's economic possiblities.</p>
<p>The two-day conference, continuing on Tuesday and gathering around 180 top military officers, is to discuss reforms including a streamlining of the general staff through splitting off a separate land forces command.</p>
<p>The changes, partly aimed at ensuring better civilian control, could mean job cuts at the top of the military and have caused concern in the forces.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Stanislaw Dobrzanski said they would not be hasty.</p>
<p>&quot;We will carry out such reforms but we can't change everything at once, because if we touch all centres with reform -- and reform is a kind of disorganisation -- this could be bad for the defence system,&quot; he said at the conference.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton said last week he hoped to see new members in NATO by 1999 and Poland is widely assumed to be in the front rank of candidate countries.</p>
