<title>SLOVAKIA: Losses in leading stocks drive Slovak bourse down.</title>
<headline>Losses in leading stocks drive Slovak bourse down.</headline>
<dateline>BRATISLAVA 1997-02-27</dateline>

<p>Major Slovak stocks closed mixed in moderate trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange on Thursday, with losses to several blue chips pulling the SAX index down 1.97 points to 210.72.</p>
<p>The biggest loser was unlisted drug maker Slovakofarma, which closed down 70 crowns at 4,700.</p>
<p>But dealers pointed out that only 72 shares in Slovakofarma traded, and low volumes also plagued most of the issues on the 16-share index.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse's rally over the past few weeks probably lasted too long and was too fragile to continue further,&quot; said Radovan Dzugas of Creditanstalt, adding that the downtrend should continue in the mid-term.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from low liquidity, which a a chronic problem on the BSE, the market desperately needs strong market makers quoting both sides of offers to give it fundamental grounds for a stronger trend,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Overall volume rose to 380,897 shares, boosted mainly by direct trades, from 227,889 shares on Wednesday. Turnover increased to 527.97 million crowns, from 285.65 million.</p>
<p>Oil refiner Slovnaft gained six crowns to close at 971, but dealers said they saw little room for a longer-term increase. Steel producer VSZ lost nine crowns to close at 706.</p>
<p>&quot;VSZ should not fall significantly lower, given it's a fundamentaly good issue,&quot; Dzugas said.</p>
<p>Nafta fell 49 crowns to 1,601 crowns. Brokers said the issue now appeared to be a good target for speculative investment due to its low price. -- Peter Laca, Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-521-8402</p>
