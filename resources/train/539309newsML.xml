<title>USA: CME hogs end mostly off, pork bellies off sharply.</title>

<p>CME hog futures ended mostly lower with nearby June down sharply on liquidation and technical pressure while pork bellies also fell expectations of a near term top in pork markets, traders said.</p>
<p>Hogs closed 0.950 cent per lb lower to 0.600 higher with June off most at 94.425 cents.</p>
<p>Pork bellies ended 2.925 to 0.950 cents a lb lower after surging to new contract highs early with May pacing the break and posting a limit loss of 3.000 cent in the closing range. July ended down 2.825 at 91.850. May set a new high early of 95.200 cents, July 94.950 and August 92.100 before falling.</p>
<p>Expectations that cash hog prices have peaked and that values would slip Monday, pressured hog futures. Indications are that cash hogs will trade lower early next week despite packer cutbacks in slaughter operations expected to continue next week, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of people concerned that we did not move enough hogs to market this week and that everything is going to show up on Monday,&quot; said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for Alaron Trading Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;The anticipation of a flood of hogs after the weekend broke the hogs and bellies (futures) today,&quot; Levitt added.  </p>
<p>Pork bellies posted new contract highs early on spillover buy stops, but ran into long-standing chart resistance around 95.000 cents and fell sharply as long liquidation pressured the market and hit sell stops. Some of the early selling came on rumors of increased product storings and reduced demand for cash bellies, but most of the selling was later attributed to concern the market has put in a near-term top, traders said.</p>
<p>Hogs and bellies alike, appeared too high-priced after the recent runup in values prompted by the Taiwan pork ban and expected increased pork exports to Japan, they said.</p>
<p>Pork bellies recently have been buoyed by greater export interest but the runup in values has likely shut off domestic demand, they said. Cash belly prices had climbed to $90 per cwt for 14-16 lb product, the highest level since August 14.</p>
<p>Technicals also turned bearish in hog futures as they were trading under last week's close after setting new highs on Thursday. Bellies would also turn technically down if they open lower on Monday, traders added.</p>
<p>Rand Financils, Cargill Investor Services and R.J. O'Brien sold hogs late while LFG and locals pressured bellies into the close. In hog options, Rosenthal Collins bought June 78 and 80 puts early and trade was mixed later, pit sources added.</p>
