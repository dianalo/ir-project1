<headline>Donors ready for food aid for 500,000 Kenyans.</headline>

<p>Foreign donors are starting to provide food aid to nearly 500,000 people in northern Kenya because of shortages caused by the failure of three successive rains.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) is asking donors for $12.4 million to buy 25,000 tonnes of maize, beans and vegetable oil to feed distressed people in North Eastern and Eastern provinces for the next six months.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in 1997 is the most serious since the 1992/93 drought. If the next rains in March and April fail, we have a big problem,&quot; Mike Sackett, WFP's director in Kenya, told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>Kenya's government formally requested donor assistance last week, relief agency sources said, after months of playing down reports from the north that drought was raising food prices, leading to increased rates of malnutrition and infant mortality.</p>
<p>But the partial failure of the area's annual short rains last November and December made a relief operation essential.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a growing crisis now but we are talking about preventing a major one later,&quot; said Adam Leach, the Kenya representative for British aid agency Oxfam.</p>
<p>&quot;There is growing vulnerability and growing levels of desperation among local populations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Food distribution has begun or is about to begin to 270,000 primary school children in Eastern Province, which stretches up to the Ethiopian border, and to about 207,000 drought victims in North Eastern province, neighbouring Somalia.</p>
<p>The arid North East is Kenya's poorest and most thinly populated province. Food supply is precarious for the mainly pastoral people at the best of times.</p>
<p>The region has seen little development since independence from Britain in 1963 and the Somali conflict in the 1990s has flooded the province with immigrants and weapons.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the area which is the most wretched of the country,&quot; a local member of parliament, Maalim Farah, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The food reserve is inadequate and we have a crisis of major proportions. The government will have to import a lot of food,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kenya's strategic food reserve is intended for use in precisely the circumstances now existing in the north. The WFP's Sackett said the government is drawing from the reserve to help out but it has shrunk to about 700,000 90-kg bags of maize from the target level of three million bags.</p>
<p>Donor sources monitoring food stocks are alarmed about rising prices nationwide of maize, the staple for Kenya's 30 million people.</p>
<p>Because of last year's poor harvest and 25 percent duty on imported maize there is currently a 500,000 tonne deficit, one expert said.</p>
<p>Wholesale maize prices in Nairobi have risen 87 percent since January, 1996, and are still climbing, threatening food security for the poor majority of the capital's three million people.</p>
<p>Kenya's national food security committee is due to meet next week and is under pressure from donors to lift or ease the import duty, the sources said.</p>
