<p>Zimbabwe threw away a golden chance of beating Pakistan when four of their batsmen fell to needless run outs in their Sharjah Cup match on Sunday.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Pakistan who ran out easy victors by 93 runs after Zimbabwe were all out for 94.</p>
<p>Disciplined bowling by Zimbabwe saw Pakistan dismissed for 187 in their full allotment of 50 overs and Zimbabwe began well enough to suggest they could spring a surpise against the former World Cup champions.</p>
<p>They reached 39 without loss but openers Craig Wishart (29) and Grant Flower (14) were both run out and only Andy Flower, with an unbeaten 21, reached double figures as the rest of the batting collapsed in miserable fashion.</p>
<p>It was their lowest score in a one-day international, five less than they managed against West Indies in Hyderabad, India in November 1993.</p>
<p>Inzamam-ul-Haq top scored for Pakistan with 46 off 68 balls which included two sixes off consecutive balls from Guy Whittal.</p>
<p>Salim Malik (33) and Mohammad Wasim (27) chipped in with useful contributions.</p>
<p>Pace bowlers Heath Streak, with three for 37, and Everton Matabanadzo, two for 25, made good use of a seaming pitch with low bounce.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka, the third team in the tournament, have called up paceman Ravindra Pushpakumar as a replacement for Nuwan Zoysa who has a pulled thigh muscle.</p>
