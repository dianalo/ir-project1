<p>India's new domestic aviation policy, which keeps the door shut on foreign airlines, sends confusing signals to investors and underlines the divisions in the ruling coalition, analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a retrograde step in the country's march to liberalisation,&quot; S.S. Sidhu, an aviation analyst, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is going to be counter-productive and will send negative signals to foreign investors,&quot; said Sidhu, a former secretary general of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's cabinet on Friday allowed foreign investors to take stakes of up to 40 percent in domestic airlines.</p>
<p>But the government deferred a crucial decision on whether to allow foreign airlines or airport companies to participate directly in equity in domestic airlines, and lobbed the thorny issue back into the Civil Aviation Ministry's court.</p>
<p>The biggest potential casualty of the new policy was a controversial $600 million tie-up between Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) and India's Tata group, with SIA proposing to take a 40 percent stake in the planned airline.</p>
<p>The proposal, which has been hanging fire for two years, was vehemently opposed by Civil Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim, who also also holds the Information and Broadcasting portfolio and so controls two sectors sensitive about foreign investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Different ministries speak in different voices and there is no clear and transparent policy,&quot; a spokesman for a foreign airline, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Industry Ministry earlier this month approved the Tata-SIA tie-up and forwarded it to the cabinet. Analysts said Friday's decision signalled a victory for Ibrahim, who is ideologically opposed to Industry Minister Murasoli Maran.</p>
<p>&quot;India needs technology and expertise which proposals like Tata-SIA could bring in,&quot; the foreign airline spokesman said.</p>
<p>India dismantled a state aviation monopoly as part of a series of radical reforms in 1991, opening its skies to a dozen private airlines.</p>
<p>But analysts say most airlines, weighed down by crippling fuel and maintenance costs, low passenger fares and government laws that force them to fly to remote, unprofitable regions, are foundering. Only three private airlines are currently flying.</p>
<p>The state-owned airlines are not doing much better. Indian Airlines, the domestic carrier, reported a net loss of 1.1 billion rupees ($30 million) in fiscal 1995/96 ended last March 31 after a loss of 1.9 billion rupees the previous year.</p>
<p>Air-India, the international flag-carrier, plunged to a 2.7 billion rupee net loss in 1995/96 after net profit of 400 million the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Sidhu said both the airline and airport businesses were highly capital-intensive and added that governments in developing countries find it difficult to fund modernisation and to expand their domestic networks.</p>
<p>Ibrahim, a close ally of Deve Gowda, and communist partners in the ruling United Front put their foot down and opposed the entry of foreign airlines at the cabinet level, a deputy said.</p>
<p>&quot;This move does not imply any involvement of foreign airlines in domestic aviation tie-ups,&quot; Ibrahim told Reuters. &quot;It effectively means that foreign individuals can create a company and hold a 40 percent stake.&quot;</p>
<p>Sidhu said this policy would also hurt India's growing tourism industry which hopes to attract five million annual visitors by the year 2000, up from the currently low level of two million.</p>
<p>He said seats on domestic flights were not growing fast enough to keep pace with the needs of the tourism industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Are people like C.M. Ibrahim to be allowed to cut loose,&quot; Cushrow Irani, editor of the Statesman newspaper, wrote on Saturday. &quot;My question to Prime Minister. Does your Government still expect to be taken seriously by overseas investors?&quot; ($1 = 35.8 rupees)</p>
