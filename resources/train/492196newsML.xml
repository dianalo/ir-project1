<headline>Italian PM Prodi's popularity hits low, poll says.</headline>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's popularity has fallen to its lowest level since his election victory almost one year ago, an opinion poll published on Monday said.</p>
<p>The survey among 1,000 Italians by the Explorer group for La Stampa newspaper also showed the main opposition centre-right Freedom Alliance nearly five percentage points ahead of Prodi's centre-left Olive Tree coalition in terms of voter support.</p>
<p>It showed a 47 percent approval rating for Prodi, down from 53 percent in the previous survey on March 3 and well adrift of a high of 68 percent last August 5.</p>
<p>The government's satisfaction rating also dropped, down to 23 percent from 27 percent and a peak of 44 percent last July 1.</p>
<p>Prodi's coalition won a historic general election victory last April 21 and took office in May as the first government to include the left since the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>The rival blocs face their first major test of popular support since last year on April 27 when some nine million Italians will be eligible to vote in local elections in more than 1,100 towns and cities, including Milan and Turin.</p>
<p>Asked how they would vote in a general election, 45.6 percent of respondents said for the Freedom Alliance and 40.8 percent for the Olive Tree. The others were &quot;don't knows&quot;.</p>
<p>La Stampa said the drop in support for Prodi and his government reflected dissatisfaction over new revenue-raising measures brought in under a supplementary budget announced last month to keep the 1997 deficit in check.</p>
<p>The 15.5 trillion lire ($93 billion) package, on top of tax-raising measures in the full 1997 budget, was drawn up to try to ensure the deficit stays within the ceiling of three percent required for joining Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>La Stampa said bickering and hesitation in Prodi's alliance over the crisis in Albania had also affected voter opinions.</p>
<p>It added, however, that a slim majority of 50.6 percent approved of plans for an Italian-led security force for Albania, while 62.9 percent agreed with the government that Albanian refugees should receive temporary shelter in Italy.</p>
