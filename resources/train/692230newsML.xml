<p>Venezuelan electricity rate hikes decreed Thursday work out at an average 75 percent over the next six months for leading local utility and stock market bellwether Electricidad de Caracas, the company told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a first increase of around 25 percent and then there's five percent every month for the next six months starting July 1,&quot; Electricidad's head of tariffs and markets Rafael Ponte said, adding that the cumulative increase worked out at some 75 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is what we asked for based on our calculations that used official government projections for this year's inflation and exchange rate,&quot; Ponte added.</p>
<p>Under government regulations, adjustments in Venezuelan tariffs are meant to ensure a maximum real nine percent return on equity. The rise thus compensates for inflation, which last year topped 100 percent and is targeted to reach 35 percent for 1997.</p>
<p>Ponte said that while the company was &quot;not there at the moment, we could reach that (rate of return) by the end of the year.&quot;  </p>
<p>The complicated and long-awaited scheme for increasing tariffs, published in Thursday's official gazette that records all government legislation, goes some way to reducing subsidies effectively paid by business to soften costs for residential users, Ponte said.</p>
<p>&quot;Residential rates will rise slightly more than business users (under the decree) ... But it's unrealistic to expect 20 or 30 years of cross-subsidies to end in just six months,&quot; Ponte said.</p>
<p>The utility's stock rallied nearly seven percent Thursday on news of the increase, closing at 692 bolivars.</p>
<p>In early trade Friday, shares gained a further 13 bolivars to 705.00.</p>
