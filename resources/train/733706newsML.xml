<p>Two rain systems were forecast to move across the U.S. Midwest between now and early next week, with the second system offering the best chance of rain for dry areas in central Illinois, meteorologists said.</p>
<p>High temperatures in the mid to high 90s degrees Fahrenheit were expected over most of the Midwest Wednesday ahead of the first storm system. The storms should cool the northern portion of the Midwest Thursday, but the 90s should remain in the southern half of the area, said Fred Gesser, Weather Express Inc meteorologist.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are basically dry in the Midwest today (Wednesday),&quot; said Gesser.</p>
<p>Rain should enter the Midwest Thursday with amounts of 0.25 to 1.5 inches and 40 percent coverage from northern Iowa and southern Minnesota east across the northern quarters of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, Gesser said.</p>
<p>A second storm system, now forming in the central Plains, was forecast to enter the Midwest Sunday and may bring moisture to dry portions of central Illinois.  </p>
<p>&quot;This has a little bit better chance of producing scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Midwest,&quot; said Joel Burgio, Weather Services Inc meteorologist. &quot;It also could bring some cooler weather to all areas.&quot;</p>
<p>Burgio expected 0.25 to 1.00 inch of rain from the system over 60 percent of the area Sunday to Tuesday, which ought to include central Illinois.</p>
<p>Peoria, Ill., has received less than 10 percent of its normal rainfall in the past 30 days.</p>
<p>Ninety-degree temperatures were forecast to return late next week across much of the Midwest.</p>
