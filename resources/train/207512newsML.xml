<p>A top pro-British Protestant leader pilloried Britain and Ireland on Thursday for letting themselves be &quot;bamboozled&quot; into expecting a peace pledge from IRA guerrillas and their Sinn Fein political wing.</p>
<p>The Protestant official, David Trimble, accused Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring of wasting time in multi-party talks by trying to woo Sinn Fein.</p>
<p>&quot;There is quite clearly no commitment to peaceful means or the democratic process as far as Sinn Fein is concerned,&quot; Trimble, who leads the Ulster Unionist Party, told BBC radio.</p>
<p>&quot;What has happened over the last two months is that Mr Spring and Mr Mayhew have allowed themselves to be bamboozled essentially by Sinn Fein that started some rumours of ceasefires.&quot;</p>
<p>Trimble was due to meet Prime Minister John Major in London later on Thursday.</p>
<p>His attack came after Spring and Mayhew reaffirmed a demand for an unequivocal Irish Republican Army ceasefire during bilateral talks in Belfast late Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said all-party talks after a truce, and guerrilla disarmament in parallel with political negotiations, was the best way forward.</p>
<p>Multi-party talks have been under way in Belfast since June but Sinn Fein is excluded because the IRA resumed a bombing campaign against British rule of the province last February.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein wants an unconditional seat at the talks and has signalled that the IRA will not call a truce if Britain gives way to Unionist demands for guerrilla arms to be surrendered before talks can begin.</p>
<p>Trimble's comments were scorned by Mark Durkan, a senior negotiator with the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, who said Unionist inflexibility had blocked talks on wide-ranging substantive issues.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not the case that the Ulster Unionist Party have been pushing for the talks to move on to make progress in substantive talks. They have been specifically blocking it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Spring said after Wednesday's talks that politicians were making strenuous efforts to get the IRA to restore a 1994 ceasefire that had provided a historic respite after 25 years of attacks on British forces and sectarian strife.</p>
<p>The IRA has set off a string of bombs at British targets and security has been strengthened at army bases in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</p>
<p>British security chiefs have warned the guerrillas might strike at any time to win concessions for Sinn Fein.</p>
<p>However political analysts say public statements by British ministers and senior Sinn Fein figures is evidence of moves to create conditions for a new ceasefire.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein sources say several hundred of its members will attend a private conference in the Irish Republic on Saturday to discussthe party's so-called &quot;peace strategy&quot;.</p>
