<title>USA: Grand jury probe ordered in Oklahoma bomb case.</title>

<p>An Oklahoma judge Wednesday ordered a grand jury investigation into an alleged cover-up by federal agents in the Oklahoma City bombing case.</p>
<p>The grand jury probe was forced by Republican state Representative Charles Key, who collected about 10,600 signatures -- more than twice the number needed -- on a petition to investigate the bombing and the way it was handled by federal agents.</p>
<p>District Judge Charles Owens ruled that Key had met all the requirements and ordered that a state grand jury be selected from a pool of 100 potential jurors on June 30.</p>
<p>Key has been highly critical of the FBI and meets regularly with anti-government groups who share his theory that federal agents were aware of a bombing plot but either deliberately did nothing or bungled their bid to stop it.</p>
<p>He said he was pleased with the judge's order, but it was not clear who would present evidence to the grand jury because state Attorney General Drew Edmondson and Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy have both said they believed Key's allegations were unfounded.</p>
<p>Key called on both Edmondson and Macy to remove themselves from the probe &quot;because they themselves have been so extremely biased&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Over and over again, he (Macy) has done everything that he could do to try to stop us. Rhetoric is one thing and actions are another, and that's what really counts -- action,&quot; Key said.</p>
<p>Key's conspiracy theory centred on information he claimed showed federal agents knew there was going to be a bomb attack on the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in downtown Oklahoma City before it happened on the morning of April 19, 1995. The bomb blew the building apart and killed 168 people.</p>
<p>A federal jury in Denver last week found Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh guilty of planting the bomb, and was expected to decide this week whether he should be sentenced to death by lethal injection or life in prison.</p>
<p>Alleged co-conspirator Terry Nichols was scheduled to go on trial later this year but Key and other government critics claimed others were involved in or knew about the bombing plot.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to find the truth and hold everyone accountable who had any participation or knowledge in this,&quot; Key said when he presented his petition for a grand jury investigation last week.</p>
<p>Many relatives of the 168 people killed in the bombing have accused Key of trying to take political advantage of the tragedy. Officials said the grand jury probe will be presided by District Judge William Burkett.</p>
