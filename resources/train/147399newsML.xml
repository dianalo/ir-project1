<p>The left-wing Sandinista Front stepped up attacks on Nicaragua's disputed elections on Monday, saying a party vote count had reversed the results of the key election for the mayor of the capital Managua.</p>
<p>&quot;We have counted the voting acts one-by-one, and we are completely certain that Sandinista candidate Carlos Guadamuz won the election, not Liberal Alliance candidate Roberto Cedeno,&quot; Monica Baltodano, Sandinista congressional candidate for Managua, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>The Sandinistas have criticised Nicaragua's Oct. 20 elections as riddled with &quot;serious irregularities,&quot; hinting at fraud by their right-wing Liberal Alliance rivals, led by self-proclaimed president-elect Arnoldo Aleman.</p>
<p>&quot;It's obvious there were a large number of fraudulent acts and serious irregularities,&quot; Baltodano said. &quot;In my opinion if these elections had taken place in any other country, they would have been annulled due to the extent of the irregularities.&quot;</p>
<p>The Supreme Election Council (CSE) has said it will not annul the vote and is reviewing the count based on original voting acts signed by party officials on election day.</p>
<p>Sandinista officials are also reviewing the vote count nationwide using the copies of the original voting acts taken by the party's monitors in the voting stations.</p>
<p>They charge that the preliminary vote count was based on telegrams sent from the voting stations to CSE headquarters, not the original voting acts, and these telegrams had been altered by pro-Aleman election officials.</p>
<p>Eight days after the elections, with no official winners announced and discontent rising among Sandinista activists, the country was waiting with baited breath.</p>
<p>At the news conference, Baltodano said it was still too early to &quot;speak of a Sandinista defeat.&quot;</p>
<p>But with both Aleman and Cedeno, who was deputy mayor of Managua prior to the elections, having already held their victory celebrations, any reversal of vote results was sure to set off political fireworks.</p>
<p>Preliminary results gave Cedeno a 38 to 32 percent lead over Guadamuz, the maverick director of the popular Sandinista-owned Radio Ya known for his scrapes with the Sandinista hierarchy.</p>
<p>The Sandinistas' revised count had Guadamuz topping Cedeno 30.1 to 28 percent. Both sides await the CSE's official revision, which could take anywhere from two to eight days.</p>
<p>Baltodano said her party had not finished reviewing the presidential vote, which the first count gave to Aleman 49 to 38 percent over former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.</p>
<p>International vote monitors, including former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, judged the elections flawed but basically fair, discounting Sandinista allegations of fraud.</p>
