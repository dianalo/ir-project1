<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe's office denied on Friday a newspaper report that the government had plans to make it easier for businesses to dismiss workers if they promised to hire again when business conditions allow.</p>
<p>&quot;Contrary to information published by the newspaper Le Monde, there is no government plan to make it easier to dismiss workers,&quot; the prime minister's office said in a statement.</p>
<p>In its edition published on Friday, Le Monde said the government was strongly in favour of the idea and planned to discuss it with unions. It said Juppe had revealed the plan this week at a national council meeting of the ruling RPR.</p>
<p>Businesses complain that difficulties in getting rid of workers during economic downturns make them reluctant to hire them when the economy picks up.</p>
