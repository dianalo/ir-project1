<p>Traders on the Slovak foreign exchange market said on Wednesday they remain wary of a weakening crown, despite denials by government officials that a direct devaluation of the currency is not imminent.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar emerged from a meeting with his economic cabinet on Sunday rejecting rumours that the country's widening trade deficit would force the government to devalue the crown.</p>
<p>Meciar called a devaluation &quot;out of the question&quot; and said the government would adopt other measures to help eliminate unfavourable developments in the trade balance.</p>
<p>But the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) continued its indirect weakening of the crown on Wednesday through its fixing against a currency basket, implying a depreciation against the basket parity of 0.60 percent, after an appreciation of 0.51 percent two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The NBS (fix) is showing the crown's direction, though (it's) contrary to what has been declared (by officials),&quot; Robert Hakszer, head of Slovenska Sporitelna dealing, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The crown has lost some 1.3 percent against the dollar over the past fortnight.</p>
<p>Igor Pazicky, treasury manager at Credit Lyonnais in Bratislava, commented: &quot;The country's economic figures do not fuel the crown enough to get back over parity, its (down) trend clear, though the question is where is the floor?&quot;</p>
<p>The trade deficit for the first seven months of the year widened to 31.895 billion crowns, from 26.97 billion for the January-June period, boosted by growing imports, especially of consumer items.</p>
<p>The NBS fixes the crown daily against a 60/40 percent mark/dollar basket within plus/minus five percent of the basket's midpoint.</p>
<p>Spurred by the fix, the market pushed the crown lower against the basket to well below the central bank offer amid further foreign currency buying sentiment, finally settling at around 0.98 percent below parity.</p>
<p>Dealers said that foreign currency inflows had waned somewhat recently with the swing in the crown's direction.</p>
