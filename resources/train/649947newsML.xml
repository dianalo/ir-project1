<p>Defence attorneys trying to save the life of convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh portrayed him on Tuesday as deeply troubled by the government's raid on the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas.</p>
<p>Using magazine articles and a videotape, McVeigh's attorneys attempted to show jurors that the Gulf War veteran became distraught over the 1993 deaths at Waco of cult leader David Koresh and about 80 of his followers, and was influenced by news accounts blaming federal agents.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged McVeigh was so angered by the raid that he took revenge by bombing the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people and injuring hundreds more.</p>
<p>The jury, which convicted McVeigh of the bombing last week, must decide whether he should be executed or get life in prison for the 1995 bombing.</p>
<p>Federal Judge Richard Matsch cautioned the jury of seven men and five women that they were presented evidence about Waco in order to assess McVeigh's views and beliefs, not to retry the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;If we open this up to a full trial about what happened at Waco ... there would be a great deal of controversy over what the facts were,&quot; the judge said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're here to decide what relevance this evidence has to bear, if any, as mitigating factors,&quot; the judge told the jury.</p>
<p>But the defence kept the focus on Waco all day, putting on the stand journalists who had written about it and playing an hour-long video, &quot;Day 51, The True Story of Waco,&quot; featuring scenes of the fire that destroyed the cult compound and ended the 51-day siege.</p>
<p>McVeigh watched the video intently.</p>
<p>The video, critical of the actions of federal agents at Waco, showed pictures of cult members who died in the fire, reminiscent of testimony during the penalty phase about victims in the Oklahoma bombing.</p>
<p>Survivors and relatives of bombing victims testified for 2-1/2 heart-wrenching days about how their lives had been irrevocably changed by the bombing.</p>
<p>In a rare moment the jurors heard McVeigh's own words, as the judge read aloud in a matter-of-fact voice a signed affidavit acknowledging he had read and seen a variety of magazine articles and videos about the Waco siege.</p>
<p>Michelle Rauch, who covered Waco for her college newspaper and interviewed McVeigh, testified that he opposed the way the federal agents were handling the standoff.</p>
<p>McVeigh was so concerned about Waco that he travelled there and sold bumper stickers, reading &quot;Fear the government that fears your gun&quot; and &quot;A man with a gun is a citizen, a man without a gun is a subject.&quot;</p>
<p>Defence attorneys tried to show the human side of McVeigh, putting on the stand in previous sessions boyhood friends, family and old army buddies who portrayed McVeigh as a smart and friendly youngster and a model soldier.</p>
<p>In the affidavit, McVeigh said he read many articles in Soldier of Fortune magazine. The Boulder, Colorado, based magazine is popular among soldiers, survivalists and gun enthusiasts.</p>
<p>James Pate, a journalist with the magazine, testified that among many militia and self-described patriot groups Waco was viewed as an example of a government out of control.</p>
