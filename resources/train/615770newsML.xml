<headline>IBM hits second record close ahead of split.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of International Business Machines Corp closed Tuesday at a new all-time high, its second in a week, the day before IBM's much anticipated two-for-one stock split goes into effect.</p>
<p>Tuesday, a surge in technology shares helped fuel IBM's stock to a new record closing price. On the New York Stock Exchange, IBM soared and closed unofficially up 5-1/2 to 178-7/8, a second record in a week. Last Wednesday, IBM closed at 175-1/8, its first record close since August 1987.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to see it close at an all-time high before they do the split,&quot; said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is rather symbolic that it was able to close at an all-time high before they do the split,&quot; Jones added. &quot;People are starting to appreciate some of the strengths underlying the business.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, IBM's two-for-one stock split goes into effect. Its post-split shares have already been trading on a when-issued basis and closed up 2-1/4 at 89 Tuesday.</p>
<p>Its previous record high was in August 1987, when it closed at 174-3/4, before the October 1987 stock market crash.</p>
<p>IBM's shares are starting to mirror the dramatic financial comeback of the computer giant, analysts said.  </p>
<p>In 1993, when Louis Gerstner took over as chairman and CEO, IBM was losing money and its shares hit a low of around 40, amid a massive write-off and restructuring charge, which included laying off of about 25,000 people.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors are encouraged by IBM's recent financial performance, such as the first quarter, when IBM managed to show nine percent revenue growth, on a constant currency basis, despite a big drop in some hardware revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;IBM is a convenient place to put money,&quot; said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst. &quot;The attitude on IBM has switched positive again.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;One thing the investor tries to find is stocks which have lots of moving pieces which can balance the ebb and flow of technology changes,&quot; said Jones of Salomon. &quot;What IBM is attempting to do is balance their businesses.&quot;</p>
<p>Even though IBM's mainframe and minicomputer revenues declined in the first quarter, it saw a surge of growth in computer services, growth in some of its software and in PCs.</p>
<p>Jones still rates IBM as a strong buy, but adds that with the stock around 177, it is hard to be as aggressive. He said it is too early to tell how the stock will perform after the split goes into effect on Wednesday.</p>
