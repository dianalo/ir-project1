<p>Saying he was apprehensive about his first debate with Republican Bob Dole, President Bill Clinton on Thursday went to a resort retreat in western New York to prepare for the Sunday face-off.</p>
<p>Clinton planned to spend the next three days practicing for the debate, which takes place in Hartford, Connecticut.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said he spoke with Clinton about the first of two nationally televised debates with Dole. &quot;(I) just asked him how he felt about his debate preparation. He said 'apprehensive,'&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>&quot;He feels like he's behind schedule in preparing and he wants to start focusing in on some of the arguments he'd like to make Sunday night,&quot; McCurry told reporters on Air Force One as Clinton flew from Washington to Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta told reporters the two-day Middle East peace talks in Washington had forced Clinton to cancel several planned practice sessions.</p>
<p>The summit with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein ended on Wednesday without any substantive progress, although the two sides agreed to continue negotiating.</p>
<p>As a result, Panetta said Clinton had spent only &quot;a couple of hours&quot; in formal, sit-down sessions preparing for the debates.</p>
<p>Presidential debates are as much about perception as performance, and Panetta made an obvious effort to promote Dole's prowess as a debater in order to lower expectations about Clinton.</p>
<p>National opinion polls show Clinton as the overwhelming frontrunner with a lead of 10 to 15 percentage points over Dole, who has spent much of the past week prepping for the debate in Bal Harbour, Florida.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be silly for us to underestimate how effective Dole can be,&quot; said Panetta, a former Democratic congressman who often sparred with Dole in budget negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;As a senator ... the nature of that job is how to convince other people to basically go along with your position -- so he's good,&quot; Panetta said.</p>
<p>Clinton campaign officials say the race to the Nov. 5 election has entered a new phase, with the focus on preparing Clinton for the two debates, the second of which takes place on Oct. 16 in San Diego, California.</p>
<p>Vice President Al Gore and Dole's running mate, Jack Kemp, are scheduled to square off in their own debate on Oct. 9.</p>
<p>Clinton's preparations in Chautauqua will be elaborate, including mock debates with former Maine Sen. George Mitchell playing Dole and coaching from Michael Sheehan, a consultant who has trained a long list of Democratic political figures on effective television techniques.</p>
<p>Panetta said the debate team was preparing Clinton for what it expected would be the likely lines of attack from Dole, a man known for his rapier wit. &quot;You'll get people who will work him in terms of the answers and how he presents the answers and how he deals with the Dole attack,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>White House officials were also intent on making sure that Clinton, a man notorious for his high energy and late-night habits, gets plenty of rest.</p>
<p>Clinton may take some time out to play golf or hike around the Chautauqua Institution, a gated, Victorian retreat for the arts and education that sits on a 750-acre (303 hectare) campus along the Chautauqua Lake in western New York state.</p>
<p>The president flew here by helicopter after making a brief campaign speech to several thousand people at the Buffalo airport. He was slated to depart on Sunday for Hartford.</p>
