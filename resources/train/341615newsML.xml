<headline>Bausch &amp; Lomb Q4 eyewear revenues down.</headline>
<dateline>ROCHESTER, N.Y. 1997-01-29</dateline>

<p>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc said Tuesday it suffered a sharp decline in sunglass sales during the 1996 fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Revenues in the eyewear segment, which includes the sunglass and thin film coating businesses, were down 21 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, it said.</p>
<p>The decline was due primarily to the cancelation of orders from its largest sunglass customer, Sunglass Hut International Inc, B&amp;L said.  </p>
<p>For the full year 1996, sales from continuing product lines in the eyewear segment fell seven percent from 1995.</p>
<p>In the vision care segment, which consists of contact lens and lens care products, revenues for the fourth quarter were up seven percent from a year earlier, B&amp;L said. Full year vision care sales rose seven percent from 1995.</p>
<p>For the 1996 fourth quarter, the pharmaceutical sector posted a one percent gain in sales, despite the negative impact of German currency swings and a significant slowdown in the German retail pharmaceutical market, the company said.  </p>
<p>B&amp;L said it posted a 10 percent net sales gain from continuing businesses in its healthcare segment in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Overall, it posted net sales from ongoing businesses of $430.0 million for the quarter, down one percent from $432.6 million a year earlier. The 1996 figure excludes $4.7 million in revenues from the dental implant business divested in mid-November. The 1995 figure excludes $7.3 million in dental implant sales, and $15.2 million in sales from the Oral Care Division, divested in September 1996.  </p>
<p>Including revenues from these divested businesses, revenues in the 1996 fourth quarter were $434.8 million, down four percent from $455.1 million in net sales recorded in the same quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>On a net basis, Rochester, N.Y.-based Bausch &amp; Lomb posted earnings of $15.8 million or $0.29 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to a net loss of $3.3 million or $0.04 a share a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company said changes in foreign exchange rates hurt 1996 results.</p>
