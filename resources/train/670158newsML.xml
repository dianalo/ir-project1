<p>Short-term Philippine bills were being bought on Wednesday as cash-rich banks and corporate investors tried to park their funds for a short period in anticipation of a rising trend in interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The short-term bills were well-bid. Buyers were locking in their excess funds in short-term bills and special saving deposits so that they can easily shift to higher-yielding instruments if the rates go up,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Some banks were bidding three-month bills with effective yield of 10.35 percent, slightly lower than the average auction rate of 10.356 percent on Monday.  </p>
<p>The overnight money also nudged up slightly to 13.0625 percent from 13.03125 percent amidst moderate turnover of 17.981 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Done rates ranged from 13.03125 percent to 13.25 percent.</p>
<p>Another trader said some banks have been investing in the one-month reverse repos of the Central Bank which were being offered at 10.5 percent.</p>
<p>Secondary T-bills trading, barring the three-month bills, was very sluggish.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is dead right now. Everybody's on the selling side,&quot; another trader said.  </p>
<p>Investors were anticipating T-bill rates to climb in the coming weeks, believing the rates have bottomed out.</p>
