<p>A senior official at Mission Control confirmed on Saturday there had been a mystery leak from the holed Spektr science module on Russia's Mir space station five days ago but said experts were sure it was not of fuel.</p>
<p>&quot;Only one thing is clear -- it was not fuel,&quot; a senior communications specialist told Reuters on condition he not be identified. &quot;But apart from that no one has an answer yet to this mystery.&quot; A NASA official said earlier there had been an as yet unexplained incident and that experts were concerned.  </p>
<p>&quot;Five days ago, in one of our communications with the crew, we were told they had seen flakes and bubbles from an unknown source leaking from the Spektr module,&quot; the specialist said.</p>
<p>He said experts were trying to analyse information from the three-man crew -- two Russian cosmonauts and a British-born NASA astronaut. The crew ran into trouble on June 25 when a cargo craft hit the station during a manual docking test and punctured the Spektr science module.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have any information on the situation inside the Spektr module,&quot; the specialist said. &quot;Measurements show there have been no other leaks in the other modules and sections of the station.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the three men were feeling fine and had spent the day making checks ready for the arrival of a new Progress cargo tug with repair supplies. Sunday would be a rest day.</p>
