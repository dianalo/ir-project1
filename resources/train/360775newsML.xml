<p>India's Industry Minister Murasoli Maran said on Thursday the government welcomed foreign investment but would protect domestic firms if they were in danger of being &quot;gobbled up&quot; by multinational corporations (MNCs).</p>
<p>&quot;If we have any substantive information that any particular industry will be gobbled up, we will take precautionary measures,&quot; Maran told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We will give protection just as America gives protection to automobiles and semiconductors. There is nothing wrong in it.&quot;</p>
<p>Maran, a free-trade advocate in Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's fractious 13-party centre-left coalition, urged domestic firms not to be afraid of multinational companies.</p>
<p>Indian companies are worried about being swept off their feet by MNCs by the wave of liberalisation India launched in 1991 to dismantle decades of socialist controls.</p>
<p>&quot;There are about 170 Indian MNCs who are there with several billions of rupees equity functioning in many countries of the world. So let us not be afraid of MNCs,&quot; Maran said.</p>
<p>Maran pledged to introduce further measures to woo foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>He said the industry ministry had set up a panel to monitor the implementation of large projects set up with foreign investment.</p>
<p>&quot;We have created a cell in my ministry to monitor the mega-projects because there is a gap between approvals and inflows. The percentage has improved from 20-21 percent to 24 percent during the current year. But this is not enough.&quot;</p>
<p>The ministry will soon enlarge the panel to focus on Germany, France, Italy and Japan and with an eye on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in those countries, Maran said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the world is not dominated by the MNCs alone. These SMEs, they play a major role in Europe and in America also. But like MNCs they have no mobility. So we have to go and approach them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's centre-left government, after assuming power in June last year, said in a policy blueprint that India can absorb $10 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI) every year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our target is $10 billion,&quot; Maran said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since July to now (until December 31) we have already approved FDI to the extent of $10 billion. This is approval. This is a great achievement, it is a feather in the cap of the government.&quot;</p>
<p>He did not give comparative FDI approvals for last year.</p>
<p>The coalition government, whose members range from free-traders to communists, has been accused by criticis of speaking in different voices and sending confusing signals to foreign investors.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the recent government decision to defer a controversial tie-up between India's Tata group and Singapore Airlines Ltd, Maran said:</p>
<p>&quot;Differences of opinion are bound to be there in a democratic society, more so in a United Front government with a 13-party alliance.&quot;</p>
<p>SIA and the Tatas have proposed a $600 million tie-up that is opposed by Civil Aviation Minister Chand Mahal Ibrahim.</p>
<p>The proposal to create a new domestic airline has drawn strong support from Maran, whose ministry approved the proposal and forwarded it to the federal cabinet.</p>
<p>Late last month, India approved a new aviation policy that permits foreign investors to hold up to 40 percent stakes in domestic airlines. But the policy does not allow foreign airlines directly to hold stakes.</p>
