<p>Relief workers sent an assessment team into Liberia's southwestern Cape Mount region for the first time in months on Wednesday in search of hungry civilians cut off by fighting among rival factions.</p>
<p>Aid officials said that the team, similar to one that discovered hundreds of starving children and old people in the town of Tubmanburg earlier this month, had left for the towns of Tiene and Bo near the border with Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>The two factions vying for control of the area -- erstwhile allies in the Mandingo ULIMO-K and Krahn ULIMO-J factions -- signed an agreement on Tuesday granting the relief groups unconditional safe passage into the area.</p>
<p>West African peacekeepers ventured into Cape Mount for the first time since January on Monday, after militia gunmen blocked three attempts by relief groups to reach the area.</p>
<p>Relief agencies believe that pockets of hungry Liberians may exist elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p>Displaced people near the southern port of Buchanan say civilians are dying from lack of food and medicine after fleeing clashes between two other rival factions in the southeast.</p>
<p>All the factions fought in the capital Monrovia in April and May. Hundreds of people died in clashes.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people have died since 1989 in the civil war in Liberia, founded by freed American slaves in 1847.</p>
<p>West African leaders rallied faction leaders round a new peace deal in August and backed it with the threat of sanctions against anyone derailing the agreement. It evisages disarmament by January of next year and elections by May.</p>
