<p>Brazil and Mexico served up an offering of Latin American football at its exuberant best on Monday to liven up what has generally been a depressing Copa America.</p>
<p>Brazil came from two goals behind to win 3-2 in an enthralling game that was full of skill and passion to make sure of a quarter-final place in a game played before a near capacity crowd in the Tahuichi stadium.</p>
<p>Earlier, Colombia had beaten Costa Rica 4-1 in the first game of a double bill.</p>
<p>The second game was further proof that the ills of the Latin American game are in the boardrooms.</p>
<p>On the field, the players, given freedom by coaches Bora Milutinovic and Mario Zagallo, produced a level of improvisation and flair which was not seen in last year's European championship in England.</p>
<p>Sadly, most of the other Copa America games have been mediocre affairs played in empty stadiums.</p>
<p>Due to the bizarre organisation of the Latin game, the competition has clashed with the region's World Cup qualifying matches, which carry a higher priority, and many teams have opted to rest their best players.</p>
<p>Brazil, however, qualify automatically for France next year as champions while Mexico were fully motivated, having been hammered 4-0 by Brazil in a friendly in April.</p>
<p>A boisterous crowd, with a Mexican mariachi band playing for much of the game, added to the occasion.</p>
<p>In a time when games kick off at times that are suitable to television rather than the public, the Copa seems to be providing proof that passionate football cannot be played in a deserted arena.</p>
<p>Mexico striker Luis Hernandez, the revelation of the competition so far, put his side two ahead by halftime, once again showing up well-known weaknesses in the Brazil defence.</p>
<p>An Aldair header and Romario shot deflected into his own net by Mexico defender Camilo Romero put Brazil level before Leonardo scored from a seeminlgy impossible position ten minutes from the end.</p>
<p>Brazil coach Zagallo was both delighted and annoyed.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a magnificent victory. The second half was a magnificent victory for art over strength. We produced great technique, everything the fans likes to see,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But we must never as apathetic as we were in the first half. This was incomprehensible.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico were one of the teams fielding a number of less experienced players. These included Hernandez, who has scored four goals in two games.</p>
<p>Another, Colombia, also performed promisingly as they hammered Costa Rica 4-1, with debutant Neider Morrantes scoring twice on his debut.</p>
<p>The results left Brazil top of group C with a maximum six points from two games, Mexico and Colombia on three and Costa Rica, playing their first Copa America, on none.</p>
<p>Mexico face Costa Rica on Thursday while Colombia take on Brazil but both could depend on results in other groups as the two best third-placed teams go into the quarter-finals along with the top two in each group.</p>
<p>In La Paz, Bolivia Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas did his bit to try and bring in bigger crowds the game when he appealed to organisers to reduce ticket prices, which are considered too high by local standards.</p>
<p>&quot;I sent .. a letter expressing my deep concern at the high ticket prices for the games at this Copa America, which are keeping the public away from the games.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The prices are really prohibitive,&quot; said Cardenas, who added that he is a soccer fanatic who never misses an international game in La Paz. &quot;We want the Bolivian people to accompany not just the Bolivian team but all the teams in large numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>Paraguay's outspoken goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, meanwhile, had the last word. &quot;Everybody has minimised the importance of this competition, but Brazil and Paraguay, who always try to do their best, have brought the best teams they can find,&quot; he said, after practising more free kicks at a training session.</p>
