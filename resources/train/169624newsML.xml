<p>Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, tipped to be Thailand's next finance minister if his Democrat Party wins in this month's election, said on Wednesday his top priority would be to restore investor confidence in the country.</p>
<p>Another key objective would be to boost sagging exports that had been caused by structural problems and could not be fixed with short-term measures, he said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Tarrin, a banker, was a finance minister in the Chuan Leekpai government which lasted from 1992-95.</p>
<p>Elections are to be held on November 17 and polls show the Democrat Party neck and neck with its main rival, the New Aspiration Party.</p>
<p>&quot;First we will regain foreign and local investor confidence. Confidence in appropriate economic policy...and confidence in the fact that economic policy will be carried out with integrity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Investors worried about a widening current account deficit, sagging exports and a stock market hovering at three-year lows, have moved out or refrained from coming to Thailand, according to economic analysts.</p>
<p>Tarrin blamed the erosion of investors' confidence on the government of Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa which saw the resignation of two finance ministers and a central bank governor during its 14-month rule.</p>
<p>On the sliding exports, Tarrin attributed the problem to high labour costs, trade barriers, and failure to keep up with foreign consumer trends.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan said he expected Thailand's 1996 export growth to be capped at five percent, well below the 23.6 percent growth posted in 1995.</p>
<p>Tarrin vowed that the Democrat Party would restore Thai export competitiveness by promoting close cooperation between public and private sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;There are structural problems which have been long delayed in terms of being tackled appropriately and systematically which should be looked at now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will look at a longer term solution. There is no quick fix for this. We won't give tax rebates and say the exports will be all right, cut tariffs and say the exports will be all right,&quot; he said, apparently referring to the measures taken by the incumbent administration to shore up exports.</p>
