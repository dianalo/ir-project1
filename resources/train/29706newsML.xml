<headline>U.S. debt futures end mixed, long end rallies.</headline>
<text>
<p>Sept 3 - U.S. debt futures end mixed. T-bond futures rallied to moderate gains, ended near day's peaks. Traders said rise powered by local, some dealer shortcovering. Buystops hit in Dec T-bonds near 106-25/32, 107-00 in oversold market. They waited for open interest data Weds. Floor brokers said 0.8-pct rise in Aug Redbook retail sales had muted effect. -Derivatives Desk(312)408-8750/E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com  </p>
<p>They waited for open interest figures due out on Wednesday to show a decline that would confirm sentiment that shorts balked and bailed out as December T-bond futures pushed upward and cleared resistance areas on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said a large local and a couple of dealers were prominent buyers on the rise, which triggered buystops near 106-25/32 and again above 107-00 in lead-month December T-bonds.</p>
<p>The floor brokers said they barely noticed the 0.8-percent rise in the Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc Redbook retail sales index for the four weeks of fiscal August versus July.  </p>
<p>Some also noted fading ideas that the Federal Reserve will hike rates later this month by the 50 basis points that a Wall Street Journal article on Tuesday suggested.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Fed policymakers are leaning toward hiking the Fed funds rate target half a percentage point, twice what many pundits had expected, at the September 24 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.</p>
<p>They also noted that some shorts likely evened up as they waited for Friday's August U.S. employment figures and as the market worked through the oil-related inflation jitters that spooked it early on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The United States said on Tuesday it launched cruise missile strikes against air defense and communications targets in southern Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi attacks on Kurds in the north.  The action hoisted crude oil prices overseas sharply higher and fanned inflation fears.</p>
<p>But the long end found some buoyancy from its oversold condition after last week's drop as well as from the lower-than-rumored, 52.6 reading in the August National Association of Purchasing Management index.</p>
<p>Futures showed muted response, however, when July U.S. leading indicators rose 0.2 percent, exactly as forecast.  </p>
<p>December T-bonds ended up 19/32 at 107-12/32, T-notes rose 8/32 to 105-25/32, muni-bonds gained 10/32 to 111-30/32, T-bills lost five bps to 94.51, and Eurodollars eased three bps to 93.91. --Derivatives Desk 312-408-8750 E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
