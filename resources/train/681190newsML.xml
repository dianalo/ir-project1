<title>USA: CBOT soyoil hits contract lows on crop prospects.</title>
<headline>CBOT soyoil hits contract lows on crop prospects.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>Prospects for a big 1997/98 (Aug/Sept) soybean crop helped push CBOT soyoil futures to fresh contract lows early Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>Soymeal futures were also lower, mostly in line with soybeans.</p>
<p>The soy complex was under pressure from weather considered ideal for the development of the new soybean crop, traders said.</p>
<p>Additionally, cash sources reported high temperatures in the U.S. have caused a drop in demand for soymeal because animals eat less when it is hot outside.</p>
<p>The fresh lows in soyoil futures could spark some export interest in U.S. soyoil. Prices in the U.S. are moving closer to those in South America, CBOT traders said.</p>
<p>The soy product markets could also find support from a slowdown in crush rates. On Friday, ADM confirmed that it was slowing its crush operations because of falling margins and tight soybean supplies.</p>
<p>At 1002 CDT, July soyoil was 0.09 cent a lb lower at 22.76 cents and other months were 0.10 to 0.16 lower. July soymeal was down $3.40 at $267.70 per ton and other months were $0.30 to $2.10 lower.</p>
