<p>One of Russia's most dynamic banks, Stolichny Bank Sberezheny, launched a new giant on the Russian retail banking market on Wednesday after tying up with the country's third largest institution, Agroprombank.</p>
<p>Stolichny chairman Alexander Smolensky told a news conference his bank would start a $1 billion three-year modernisation programme at troubled Agroprombank, in which it acquired a controlling stake last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to think that with the help of Stolichny, Agroprombank will modernise its technologies,&quot; Smolensky said.</p>
<p>From 1997, Stolichny will be renamed Stolichny Bank Sberezheny-Agro. But the deal stops short of a full merger, with the two banks operating as affiliates within one group, he said.</p>
<p>Stolichny won a tender for 50 percent plus one share in Agroprombank by taking up a 130 billion rouble ($23.59 million) share issue.</p>
<p>It must transfer 24.5 percent to the government in trust. The government already has a 1.5 percent stake in Agroprombank.</p>
<p>Stolichny has been focusing on the uncompetitive market for Russian household accounts, building up a branch network to challenge the near monopoly in the sector of Russia's biggest bank, Sberegatelny Bank RF (Sberbank).</p>
<p>For Stolichny one of Agroprombank's prime assets is its network of 1,216 branches all over Russia. Smolensky said Stolichny would now curb its own network programme.</p>
<p>Agroprombank was a specialised bank of the former Soviet Union, channelling credits to farmers and related industrial sectors, such as food processing and agricultural machinery.</p>
<p>It has retained this profile and the present Russian government still uses it to channel credits to the sector, virtually dictating Agroprombank's credit policy. Many of the credits are never repaid.</p>
<p>Stolichny must preserve Agroprombank's portfolio structure, where credits to farmers make up 60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank's problems are first of all connected to the administrative ways of distributing funds, which in agriculture are stronger than in any other sector,&quot; Deputy Economy Minister Ivan Starikov told the news conference.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 1996 Agroprombank posted a loss of 140 billion roubles after a net profit in 1995 of 407 billion roubles, Agroprombank chairman Yuri Trushin told Reuters.</p>
<p>Assets at the end of 1995 totalled 16.31 trillion roubles, including 7.13 trillion roubles in loans and 407.67 billion roubles in reserves against bad credits and other losses.</p>
<p>However, Smolensky was optimistic about Agroprombank's prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank is rather stable,&quot; he said. &quot;Its liquidity does not raise any doubts. In three years it will be a superb bank.&quot;</p>
<p>A banking analyst, who asked not to be named, said Stolichny was the clear winner, as it now had access to government funds channelled through Agroprombank, gaining more capital and more weight in the banking community. It will require enormous efforts for Agroprombank to return to profit, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank will be a channel for very big budget funds and Stolichny's interest in this is absolutely clear.&quot;</p>
<p>The government's 26 percent stake in Agroprombank will relieve Stolichny from responsibility for bad credits, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very convenient scheme where formally Agroprombank channels funds and is responsible for their repayment, losses would be written off by Agroprombank, while Stolichny regulates the money flows,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Smolensky said the $1 billion modernisation programme, aimed at improving banking tehcnologies, would be funded through credits from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank and a group of German banks.</p>
<p>Stolichny must also grant a five-year, one trillion rouble credit to Agroprombank at a rate not higher than 50 percentage points over the central bank's refinancing rate, currently 60 percent, to repay Agroprombank's liabilities.</p>
