<p>Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) is likely to set the new term naphtha price at $13.50 per tonne over the mean of Middle Eastern quotes as some buyers are believed to have unofficially accepted the price, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They (KPC) have a target price. Once some players accept that, it's difficult for anybody else not to accept that as well,&quot; one naphtha dealer said.</p>
<p>The new price compares with the current premium of $6.50 for the one-year term that started a year ago, and of $7.90 for August 1996-July 1997.</p>
<p>Traders attribute the sharp rise in premiums to Asia's growing appetite for naphtha as petrochemical feedstock.</p>
<p>Most buyers in the term price talks, which started on February 17 in Singapore, are expected to accept the offer price by the end of this week or early next, they said.</p>
<p>Term lifters in the negotiations, mainly trading houses, refiners and petrochemical firms from Japan and South Korea, are expected to buy about two million tonnes of full-range naphtha from Kuwait during the term year.</p>
