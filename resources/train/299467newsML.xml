<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Friday that two bombs which exploded in Tel Aviv on Thursday night concerned only internal events in Israel, and appealed for European help to move forward peace negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;We have nothing to do with this attack. It is an attack which concerns internal events within Israel,&quot; Arafat told reporters after meeting French President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>The blasts, which Israel blamed on Arab militants, wounded at least 13 people near Tel Aviv's central bus station, officials said.</p>
<p>No one claimed responsibility. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed &quot;terrorists&quot;. Police said on Friday forensic evidence pointed to a terrorist act but they could not rule out a criminal gangland attack.</p>
<p>The explosions came against the backdrop of U.S.-brokered talks on Israel's long-delayed withdrawal from most of the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>Arafat said that Netanyahu's demand for a postponement of the Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank until 1999 &quot;literally blows up the whole peace process just as making new settlements and expanding settlements sabotages the whole peace process&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the Palestinians were not demanding the impossible, but simply the precise application of agreements which had been previously signed with Israel.</p>
<p>He urged Europe to play a greater role: &quot;I asked President Chirac to support and work for the European role because the European Union has an important role to play in protecting and moving forward the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>Referring to Israeli and U.S. opposition to a European role in the negotiations, Arafat said: &quot;How can one ask the EU and France to play an economic and financial role while some people continue to refuse a political role?&quot;</p>
<p>Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told reporters the French leader had agreed that EU special envoy Jose Maria Moratinos should play an active role in giving an impulse to the peace negotiations.</p>
<p>She said the Israelis and Palestinians gave widely different accounts of each side's positions and responsibility and France would not take sides.</p>
<p>But she said Chirac stressed that respecting accords already concluded was the basis for saving the peace process.</p>
<p>The Palestinian leader was due to fly home to Gaza immediately after his brief Paris visit for talks with U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross on Saturday.</p>
