<p>South Korean embassy officials on Thursday accused North Koreans of trying to force their way into the consular office in China's capital, Beijing, where a top Pyongyang official has sought asylum.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night, North Korean people who we believe were from the embassy tried to enter our consular section,&quot; embassy spokesman Chong Moon-Ik told reporters.  </p>
<p>Chinese police on guard around the consular section compound in the diplomatic district of Beijing had prevented the North Koreans from entering, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>However, he said the embassy believed that North Korean officials were still in the vicinity of the compound, where two North Korean defectors were holed up and which has been cordoned off by dozens of Chinese police.</p>
<p>He dismissed Pyongyang's charges that Hwang Jang-yop, a senior aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, had been kidnapped by the South, saying Hwang had voluntarily sought asylum.</p>
<p>&quot;He came by taxi without any notice,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
