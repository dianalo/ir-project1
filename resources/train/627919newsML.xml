<p>South Korea's main opposition leader Kim Dae-jung on Friday blasted President Kim Young-sam's vague apology over financial abuses as &quot;pompous and confrontational&quot; and said he had hard evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>He vowed a head-on fight with the president to uncover the truth behind his spending on the 1992 presidential election campaign.</p>
<p>Kim Dae-jung, who heads the National Congress for New Politics, alleged President Kim received 300 billion won ($336 million) from his predecessor Roh Tae-woo and 60 billion won from the scandal-ridden Hanbo Group.</p>
<p>The spending limit for candidates in the 1992 elections, in which Kim Dae-jung was defeated, was 36.7 billion won.</p>
<p>&quot;I have evidence and witnesses, but they cannot come forward yet,&quot; the opposition firebrand told a news conference.</p>
<p>Roh is serving a 17-year jail term for corruption and other crimes while in office. The Hanbo Group is at the centre of a bribery scandal engulfing Kim Young-sam's own presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;His gesture, tone of voice, and the content of his speech were pompous and confrontational,&quot; said Kim Dae-jung, elected by his party last week to be its standard-bearer in presidential elections in December.</p>
<p>&quot;President Kim's attitude has disappointed the Korean people.&quot;</p>
<p>President Kim apologised in a live national television broadcast for &quot;past wrongdoings&quot; by himself and others. But he refused to give any specifics and suggested his opponents were just as guilty. He also promised reform.</p>
<p>&quot;I know the president is smart. Why would he not remember receiving money from Roh Tae-woo and Hanbo?&quot; asked Kim Dae-jung, whose intense rivalry with the president has overshadowed South Korean politics for several decades.</p>
<p>&quot;He should not use threatening words and gestures when apologising to the people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kim Dae-jung was referring to the president's unexplained warning that he would make a &quot;grave decision&quot; if the opposition scuttled efforts to implement reform.</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds ridiculous,&quot; said Kim Dae-jung. &quot;The president has the responsibility, and the power, to revise legislation if he wants.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot tolerate this any more. We have decided to fight the president directly,&quot; he said, adding his party would demand an independent probe by the National Assembly and call on the president to testify.</p>
<p>However, Kim Dae-jung said there were no immediate plans to call on the president to step down.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very important issue, which we must further discuss with the United Liberal Democrats,&quot; he said, referring to a much smaller opposition group.</p>
<p>He said it would be impossible to rally support in parliament for moves to impeach the president since the ruling New Korea Party held a majority in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Kim Young-sam's single term expires in February next year.</p>
<p>Asked about his own election funding, Kim Dae-jung said: &quot;Kim Young-sam used so much he doesn't know how much he used. But we are are poor and we know exactly how much we spent.&quot; He put his own spending at 20.7 billion won. ($1 =892 won)</p>
