<dateline>LIMA 1997-07-10</dateline>

<p>The Lima Stock Exchange continued its steady rise to close with overall gains Thursday as the construction and polymetallic mining sectors led a lively session, brokers said.</p>
<p>But brokers said investors could show caution Friday as some stocks, especially miners, might be perceived as over-valued.</p>
<p>According to preliminary figures, the bolsa's General Index rose 0.91 percent Thursday to 2,269.43 points while the blue-chip Selective Index gained 1.21 percent to 3,283.44.  </p>
<p>Volume was an improved 49 million soles ($19 million) on 2,571 trades.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot rule out that investors come out in search of profits on the polymetallic miners, because these have shown an impressive rally which is difficult to sustain,&quot; said Manuel Torres of Finvest brokerage.</p>
<p>In Thursday's trade, miner Morococha rose 5.05 percent to 10.19 soles, while the country's largest cement-maker Cementos Lima gained 3.33 percent to 6.20 soles and brewery group Unin de Cerveceras Backus y Johnston gained 2.44 percent to 2.52 soles.  </p>
<p>While polymetallic miners have gained from the recent zinc price rise, construction companies and breweries have benefitted from the anticipated damage and the Indian summer brought on by the El Nino weather phenomenon.</p>
<p>&quot;The betting is on construction companies because they are held down, since a lot of people abandoned those positions to go into the polymetallics,&quot; said Percy Romero, of Fortuna brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;At current levels, I think the polymetallic mining shares have taken into account the future price of zinc.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall, 35 shares gained, 28 fell and 29 were flat.</p>
