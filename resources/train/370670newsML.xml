<headline>Italy finds Cold War spy files on leftist judges.</headline>

<p>Hundreds of left-leaning magistrates, including a current speaker of parliament, were spied on by Italy's secret services for much of the Cold War, newspapers reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Investigators said on Monday they had opened a probe after files detailing the activities of 323 left-leaning magistrates were discovered in an Interior Ministry office last October.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very worrisome episode which at least shows how far we have progressed since then,&quot; Justice Minister Giovanni Maria Flick was quoted as saying in Turin's La Stampa daily.</p>
<p>The files were kept from the early 1960s until 1980, the papers said, adding that dossiers on Chamber of Deputies (lower house) speaker Luciano Violante, a former magistrate, and top anti-graft magistrate Gerardo D'Ambrosio were among those found.</p>
<p>&quot;They've discovered a file on me? What kind of news is that? I would have been surprised by the contrary,&quot; D'Ambrosio was quoted as telling La Repubblica.</p>
<p>D'Ambrosio was part of the elite pool of Milan magistrates whose vast corruption probes helped topple Italy's political old guard in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Asked why certain magistrates were targeted by the secret services, D'Ambrosio said: &quot;We were considered dangerous for the simple reason that we were known as leftists, which made us untrustworthy in the eyes of the state security apparatus.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspapers also reported that besides the files, 160 cases of documents containing formerly classified information on some of Italy's worst terrorist attacks during the late 1970s and early 1980s had also been found.</p>
<p>Much of the terrorism of the so-called &quot;Years of Lead&quot; remains shrouded in mystery despite numerous probes, including Italy's worst bombing outrage -- the 1980 bombing of Bologna railway station that killed 85 people.</p>
