<p>European stock markets swung erratically on Wednesday before closing higher as a volatile Wall Street sent out a series of contradictory signals.</p>
<p>European stocks opened strongly following a near-record gain on the Dow Industrials overnight, fell when strong U.S. statistics underlined the likelihood of an interest rate rise and recovered when Wall Street quickly forgot the data.</p>
<p>Data showing the U.S. economy grew more strongly than expected in the first quarter had a greater effect on the foreign exchange markets. The dollar rose at the mere whiff of possible higher U.S. rates to strike against inflation.</p>
<p>The London market, which faces a general election on Thursday, had a more erratic day than continental bourses, which face only the May Day holiday on Thursday.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 leapt to a record 4,466.5 in pre-market trading but slid slowly but surely throughout the morning.</p>
<p>The losses accelerated in the afternoon when Wall Street fell on data showing that U.S. gross domestic product recorded the biggest rise in more than nine years. It grew 5.6 percent in the first quarter, compared with an expected 4.1 percent.</p>
<p>Global financial markets are currently highly sensitive to U.S. economic statistics as investors try to guess whether the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm, will raise interest rates in a pre-emptive strike against inflation when it meets on May 20.</p>
<p>But Wall Street quickly disregarded Wednesday's figures, which gave the opposite signal to data on Tuesday which was weaker than expected. Those figures sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 179 points, its second biggest gain in points terms in history.</p>
<p>As the Dow swung from minus to a strong plus -- it was up 61.01 points or 0.88 percent to 7,023.04 by the European close -- London shares rallied modestly.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 finally closed 2.8 points higher at 4,436.0, up from a low of 4,414.3.</p>
<p>With U.S. data giving apparently contradictory messages, economists said the markets would await further U.S. reports such as Friday's employment figures for further evidence of the likely scale and timing of an interest rate increase.</p>
<p>But generally London dealers reported lethargy before the general election, which is likely to eject the Conservatives after 18 years in power and install the Labour party, an unkown quantity after so long in opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't respond properly to the Dow's rise overnight. There is just a lack of interest ahead of tomorrow,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;But once we get the election out of the way, so long as Wall Street maintains its poise, we will see some relief and the market will test its highs again.&quot;</p>
<p>Germany's DAX index of blue chips rose close to an all-time high in early trade and finished before the U.S. data up a sturdy 54.88 points or 1.62 percent at 3,474.98. The IBIS index recording later electronic trade dipped but recovered a little to close up 12.23 points at 3,438.09.</p>
<p>French shares finished strongly on high volume boosted by options expiry. The CAC-40 index closed up 36.60 points or 1.41 percent at 2,639.46.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. GDP figures gave the dollar a boost.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though GDP data are backward-looking this came as a surprise and the Fed will take notice,&quot; said Francis Breedon, foreign exchange strategist at Lehman Brothers. &quot;The data gives the Fed a further reason to tighten credit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All it needs now is a set of strong jobs data on Friday, and the dollar is off to the races,&quot; said a senior trader at a German bank in London.</p>
<p>It climbed to 1.7312 marks by the European close, up almost a pfennig from 1.7235 in late trade on Tuesday. It was at 126.96 yen compared with 126.75 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Irish pound slid to its lowest level against sterling since July 1992 after a run on the currency amid rumours that the Irish central bank stopped supporting the punt on Tuesday after heavy intervention early this week.</p>
<p>STOCKS AT CLOSE</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 closed up 2.8 points or 0.06 percent at 4,436.0.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 index closed up 36.60 points or 1.41 percent at 2,639.46.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index closed up 54.88 points or 1.62 percent higher at 3,474.98. The IBIS index recording later electronic trade closed up 12.23 points at 3,438.09.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT EUROPEAN CLOSE</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.7312marks against 1.7235 in late European trade on Tuesday. It was at 126.96 yen, slightly lower than 126.75 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold closed at $339.65 an ounce after an afternoon fixing at $340.15 and compared with a close in London on Tuesday at $339.95. Silver was at up six cents at $4.71.</p>
