<p>Asian stock markets saw a two-day rally fizzle on Wednesday after world futures markets were hit by worries over the U.S. economic outlook.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 152.86 points, or 1.15 percent, to close at 13,189.60 after a roller-coaster day that had taken it to an intra-day high of 13,473.26 in the morning.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell even further, closing a steep 253.74 points, or 1.22 percent, lower at 20,568.38.</p>
<p>Brokers said markets were unsettled by a plunge in S&amp;P 500 stock futures traded on GLOBEX, an after-hours electronic trading system, and fears that Wall Street may react negatively to the futures-market activity when it reopens on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 spot month contract had slid by between 8 and 10 points in Asian trading, a fall that brokers equated to a 100-point fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>
<p>The news prompted European stock markets to open lower.</p>
<p>Brokers speculated that the futures activity possibly reflected nervousness ahead of the monthly U.S. producer price report to be released later on Wednesday and consumer price data due out on Thursday, both for November.</p>
<p>&quot;We are again held hostage by U.S. economic statistics,&quot; said Mark Simpson, head of Hong Kong research at ING Barings Securities.</p>
<p>Japanese stocks were also dragged down by a disappointing debut for Tokyo Disneyland operator Oriental Land Co Ltd, which dominated trading, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Singapore stock market ended weaker due to the fall in S&amp;P 500 futures and profit-taking, dealers said. The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index fell 17.05 points or 0.77 percent to end at 2,192.45.</p>
<p>Unfounded rumours that Japanese investors may cut their purchases of U.S. Treasury debt securities also scared Singapore investors, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is nervous and people just took profits,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Malaysian shares fell amid vague rumours of Middle East hostilities and fears that Wall Street's recent bull run may end soon, dealers said. The benchmark Composite Index closed down 10.19 points to 1,204.39.</p>
<p>Australia's All Ordinaries Index closed 2.5 points lower at 2,359.3, shrugging off early strength as worries of a strong local currency and possible Wall Street weakness took hold.</p>
<p>Late selling by impatient stock investors pulled Taiwan share prices weaker at the close, reversing initial gains, and brokers said the expected narrow-range trading to continue in the near term.</p>
<p>The weighted index, which had pushed some 43 points higher, ended 38.29 points lower, or 0.56 percent, at 6,802.74.</p>
<p>Thai stocks deflated slightly in thin trade as locals sold stocks in most sectors, with many foreign investors away for the holidays, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index closed 3.60 points lower to 885.86.</p>
<p>Brokers also said investors were unimpressed by a policy statement by new Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on how his government plans to revive the economy.</p>
<p>The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index defied the negative sentiment to jump 32.38 points, or 1.04 percent, boosted by expectations of better earnings next year for bellweather stock San Miguel, the beverage giant.</p>
<p>Seoul stocks also ended up as hopes for government market-boosting steps helped improve sentiment, brokers said.</p>
<p>But most of the early gains were erased by profit-taking that emerged as the government remained silent on calls to restrict new share issues. The composite index ended 1.85 points, or 0.26 percent, higher at a provisional 704.68.</p>
<p>In other markets, the dollar was trading at 1030 GMT at 112.83 Japanese yen and 1.5427 German marks</p>
<p>Hong Kong's spot gold ended higher at US$368.80/369.30 per ounce, above New York's $368.40/80 close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>SIMEX Brent crude oil futures fell as well, with the January contract at $23.05 in late trading, off from London's Tuesday close of $23.29.</p>
