<p>A dispute between the main parties building Malaysia's controversial Bakun dam could delay the listing of the dam's operating company, a government official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It might, it's a possibility,&quot; Energy, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Leo Moggie told reporters in reply to a question about a delay in the listing of Bakun Hydro-Electric Corporation (BHEC) after addressing an energy conference.</p>
<p>BHEC is planning to issue 1.5 billion shares at two ringgit (73 cents) each, in what would be Malaysia's biggest public offering.</p>
<p>&quot;If the resolution of this (dispute) involves restructuring, obviously they would have to look at the financing structure,&quot; Moggie said.</p>
<p>The 2,400-megawatt capacity dam was originally supposed to have been listed on the Malaysian Stock Exchange in June. It was pushed back to this month because the prospectus was not ready.</p>
<p>Moggie also said the dispute between Ekran Bhd and Asea Brown Boveri over a contract to build the $6.0 billion Bakun dam in the Borneo state of Sarawak should be resolved in &quot;the next month or so&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think time is approaching very fast,&quot; to keep the Bakun dam construction on schedule for its 2003 opening, he said.</p>
<p>Ekran and ABB had met on July 24 and were supposed to meet again within two weeks. Moggie did not know if there had been a second meeting.</p>
<p>Ekran has said it is unhappy with terms in the contract that require it to absorb any cost overruns associated with the dam, which will create a reservoir as large as Singapore and would be Asia's second-biggest hydro-electric project.</p>
<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has vowed the dam will be built and said the contract could be broken if the terms were found to be unfair.</p>
<p>&quot;Until we hear the final report (after the second meeting) we won't have a formal statement about what the resolution will be,&quot; Moggie said.</p>
<p>Ekran had not notified his ministry about possibly pulling out of the project. &quot;We've only heard stories and rumours about Ekran pulling out,&quot; Moggie said in reply to a question.</p>
<p>The government would step in to mediate only if there was a deadlock, Moggie added. &quot;I would not want to say anything public that would jeopardise the discussions (between ABB and Ekran). &quot;We have some ideas on how to resolve it in the best possible way if the parties can't solve it themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>ABB's chief executive officer, Goran Lindahl, said last week the project would go ahead. &quot;We need a little massaging to get all the details together,&quot; he told Reuters in Zurich.</p>
<p>The Bakun contract is the largest ever awarded to the Swiss-based power engineering company, with the value exceeding $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>ABB is implementing the contract in a consortium with Brazil's Companhia Brasileria Projectos Obras (CBPO).</p>
<p>The contract calls for the consortium to supply six 420 megawatt hydro-generators, a 500-kv high voltage direct-current transmission system and install a 650-km (400-mile) submarine cable -- by far the longest in the world -- to connect the dam to peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>Ekran has a 32 percent stake in BHEC. Other key shareholders are the federal government's Employees Provident Scheme, state-owned Tenaga Nasional Bhd, the government's investment holding company Khazanah Holdings Bhd, the Sarawak state government and Sarawak Electricity Supply Corp.</p>
<p>Altogether, the stock and rights offerings would raise a total of six billion ringgit. The rest of the dam's financing is expected to be raised through borrowings, analysts said. ($ = 2.724 Malaysian Ringgits)</p>
