<p>-- BOOKIES' BLACKEST DAY COULD COST THEM 30 MILLION STG</p>
<p>It is estimated that the British bookmaking industry may have lost up to one third of its annual profits as a result of huge payouts on the record-breaking seven wins ridden by jockey Frankie Dettori on Saturday. One company Stanley Leisure was forced to issue a profits warning after losing 2.5 million stg on the event. Normally the industry would regard a loss of 2.0 million stg on one day's horse racing to be a bad result. On Saturday losses may have totalled 30 million stg.</p>
<p>-- EUROTUNNEL MISSES REFINANCING DEADLINE</p>
<p>Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel on Monday missed a deadline for reaching a refinancing agreement with its lender banks. Trading in the company's shares were suspended at its own request amid concerns about possible leaks regarding plans for its future. The suspension of shares was welcomed by shareholder groups. A French court now has the option of beginning administrative proceedings against the company - a decision that could lead to a political dispute between France and Britain over control of the business.</p>
<p>-- BLAIR BACKING EU IN BID TO WOO BUSINESS</p>
<p>At the Labour party conference leader Tony Blair is expected to place the issue of Europe at the heart of his campaign to win the business vote at the next general election. He will also establish a target of mid-1998, the year when Britain attains presidency of the EU for six months, for the completion of the single market. While keeping open the country's options on the single currency, he will at the same time stress the benefits of participation.</p>
<p>-- GERMAN EMPLOYERS RISK STRIKE OVER FRINGE BENEFIT CUTS</p>
<p>A number of large German companies are reported to be facing the prospect of industrial action in the wake of their decision to reduce the level of sick pay provided to staff. The decision by the employers to take such action has stimulated a wider debate on the issue of Germany's social welfare system and is expected to result in a fraught wage bargaining round this year. Employers maintain that cuts in benefits are essential to improving the competitiveness of German industry.</p>
<p>-- OLIVETTI DEBT SOARS AS GROUP'S PLIGHT WORSENS</p>
<p>Beleaguered Italian information and computer group Olivetti has revealed that its debt level almost doubled between the start of July and the end of August. Debt for the period rose to 1.01 billion stg, fuelling concerns among investors regarding a deterioration in the state of the company's finances. Olivetti has announced that it hopes to make use of a series of disposals to improve the situation by the end of the year.</p>
<p>-- EU REFINES DUMPING REGULATIONS</p>
<p>The EU has begun a process of reform of its anti-dumping regulations as part of a drive towards ensuring that the rules are applied in a more flexible manner and in a way which takes more account of the interests of European producers. Critics in Europe and abroad have maintained that as they currently exist such anti-dumping measures can in effect impact adversely on EU consumers and businesses. In future it is hoped the regulations will focus more sharply on instances of unfair competition.</p>
<p>-- PHOENIX WINS MoD BACKING</p>
<p>The British Ministry of Defence has announced that despite being nine years late and having overrun costs three fold it will in 1998 adopt the Phoenix unmanned reconnaissance aircraft developed by the General Electric Co. The aircraft was initially developed during the Cold War and was intended for use over enemy lines, from which it would relay information back to British forces. The project has since, however, encountered a series of technical problems so serious that in 1995 GEC was given one year to resolve the issues at its own expense or face cancellation of the project.</p>
<p>-- BRITISH GAS STAYS COOL ON HYDRO DEAL</p>
<p>British Gas has been playing down the significance of the weekend collapse of months of negotiations on the possible sale of some of its Scottish and north of England business interests to Scottish Hydro. Noting that the decision to break off talks had been mutual, the company blamed &quot;commercial hurdles&quot; as well as a lack of regulatory advice. British Gas has stressed that it is not actively seeking to sell another elements of its domestic supply network.</p>
<p>-- STOCK EXCHANGE TO SELL TRADE INFORMATION SERVICE</p>
<p>The London Stock Exchange has announced that it is to sell its loss-making electronic share trade confirmation business, Sequal, to Thomson Financial Services. Thomson has committed itself to continue running Sequal in parallel to its own rival Oasys system for the short-term before merging the two. The sale comes as part of a Stock Exchange strategy of concentrating on a narrower range of services for member companies. Terms of the sale were not disclosed.</p>
<p>-- MORTGAGES SURGE AS PRICES RISE</p>
<p>Figures published on Monday by the Bank of England and the Nationwide Building Society have revealed that UK house prices and mortgage lending have increased sharply during the summer. Over the past 12 months, according to the Nationwide, average house prices in Britain have increased by 6.7 percent, the largest annual rise for some seven years. It warned, however, that prices may have been artificially boosted by a continuing reluctance on the part of some to sell.</p>
