<title>UK: UK natural gas use outpaces oil consumption - DTI.</title>
<headline>UK natural gas use outpaces oil consumption - DTI.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Consumption of natural gas in the United Kingdom outstripped that of oil for the first time in 1996 as electricity generators continued their march away from oil and coal, latest data from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.</p>
<p>Allowing for a colder average temperature during the year natural gas accounted for over 36 percent of U.K. energy consumption, while oil accounted for little over 34 percent, the document said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas has now overtaken oil as the main primary fuel in 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>Of the other energy consumption data, coal accounted for 20 percent, nuclear power 10 percent and electricity one percent, on a temperature-corrected basis.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the reason the data did not add up to exactly 100 percent was probably because the figures for each fuel had been rounded up or down to whole numbers.</p>
<p>Total primary fuel consumption, on a temperature-corrected basis, was 2.8 percent higher than in 1995, the data showed, although the absolute total was not supplied.</p>
<p>But the U.K.'s unadjusted total consumption was 5.3 percent up, year-on-year, at 230.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent.</p>
<p>Natural gas consumption on an unadjusted basis rose by 19.9 percent year-on-year, oil use rose by just 2.9 percent and consumption of coal was 7.2 percent down.</p>
<p>Total electricity supplied was 4.4 percent up from 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Although total consumption of electricity has increased fairly steadily in recent years, the rise in 1995 and 1996 is larger than in previous years,&quot; the document said.</p>
<p>&quot;While consumption of electricity by the industrial sector has tended to fall, there has been a steep increase in the services sector. There has also been a steady increase in consumption in the domestic sector.&quot;</p>
<p>As power stations such as Didcot in England and Ballylumford in Northern Ireland converted units to gas, the U.K.'s consumption of fuel oil fell by 10.5 percent to 6.03 million tonnes of oil equivalent on an unadjusted basis, the document said.</p>
<p>Consumption of fuel oil has halved since 1900, it added.</p>
<p>The rise in natural gas production roughly matched that of its consumption.</p>
<p>While indigenous production of all primary energy fuels rose by 5.1 percent in 1996 to 283.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent, output of natural gas rose by 18.2 percent.</p>
<p>Production of oil and nuclear electricity rose by 0.8 percent and 6.3 percent respectively, while coal output was 4.1 percent down year-on-year.</p>
<p>The rise in exports of natural gas was a hefty 33 percent higher than in 1995.</p>
<p>The move towards increasing use of unleaded gasoline continued. The mix in 1996 was 67.6 percent, compared with 63.0 percent the year before.</p>
<p>The price of non-oil fuels fell -- electricity, gas and coal fell in real terms by 3.1 percent, 2.5 percent and 1.7 percent respectively year-on-year.</p>
<p>But at a time of soaring world oil prices, the average cost of crude oils bought by refineries in 1996 was 24.2 percent up from 1995, and this fed into the price for refined oil products. The price of standard grade burning oil was 15.9 percent higher while that of gas oil was up 22.3 percent.</p>
