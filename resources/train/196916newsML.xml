<p>Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger Monday announced a partial settlement with Boston Gas Co, a subsidiary of Eastern Enterprises, to scale back a proposed rate hike for residential and business customers.</p>
<p>Under the settlement's terms, which still must be approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU), Boston Gas will reduce its proposed rate hike to $13 million from $30 million for its 520,000 customers in the Commonwealth.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're pleased,&quot; said Boston Gas Co spokesman Frank Arricale, who added that his company plans on getting out of the selling of natural gas as soon as the DPU approves the rate hike proposal. That approval is expected Dec 1.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll be strictly transporting the gas, maintaining the pipelines. We're still here to fix the furnaces, but we won't be selling gas,&quot; Arricale said.</p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General George Dean said the agreement means the average residential heating customer will have a small decrease in their annual heating bill of roughly $6. Under Boston Gas's original rate hike proposal, residential customers would have seen their annual heating bills climb to $24 annually.</p>
<p>For business, which have alternatives to using natural gas, the agreement provides for a new fixed price interruptible rate option.</p>
<p>Asked why the utility agreed to the more than 50 percent cut in the rate hike it first sought, Arricale said, &quot;We see this as a way of drawing businesses into the Commonwealth. And If there are more businesses in the area, they will use more gas.&quot;</p>
