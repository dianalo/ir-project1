<p>Shares on Jordan's stock exchange rose on Tuesday in quiet trade focused on select trade in blue-chip stocks, brokers said.</p>
<p>The official Amman Financial Market 60-share index rose 0.13 percent to 153.60 points in trade worth just 256,788 dinars, hampered by the traditional torpor during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>Tuesday's turnover was the lowest in more than a week.</p>
<p>Sunflower oil and paints manufacturer Union Chemical and Vegetable Industry accounted for nearly 50,000 dinars worth of trade but fell back 0.01 dinars to 1.03 dinars.</p>
<p>Jordan Petroleum Refinery rose 0.07 dinars to 9.94 in trade worth 40,000 dinars. Brokers said the company was unaffected by the terms of Jordan's agreement for supply of cheap Iraqi oil, but may have been boosted by the guarantee of supplies for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Blue-chip Arab Bank closed unchanged after trade worth 30,000 dinars. Arab Paper Converting and Trading dropped 0.01 dinars to 1.21 and Middle East Investment Bank, whose shares are a subject of interest from a French bank, shed 0.02 dinars to 1.16 dinars.</p>
<p>No other company traded more than 10,000 dinars worth of shares.</p>
<p>Overall rising shares outnumbered falling shares by 12 to 11, with another 15 trading but closing unchanged.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Investable Index of the 45 best performing shares on the exchange fell 0.10 percent to 82.17 points.</p>
<p>$1 = 0.7080 dinar</p>
