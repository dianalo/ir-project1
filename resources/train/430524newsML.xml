<p>CBOT corn futures closed higher on a surge to limit and near limit gains in soybeans, traders said.</p>
<p>Spot March corn set a fresh 5-1/2 month high at midday during the fund-sparked bull move in the soybean complex while fund and commercial buying rallied the corn market to roughly one half the 12 cent daily limit in the nearby contracts.</p>
<p>Traders said Cargill Inc was the key buyer of 12.0 million bushels of July.</p>
<p>The strong market was evident despite the imminent release of a key government supply/demand report.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically corn is following beans. We don't have a problem with feedgrain stocks but bean stocks are another story,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>USDA at 0730 CST/1330 GMT Tuesday will release its March Supply/Demand Report and analysts were expecting the government to trim five million to 10 million bushels of soybeans from the current outlook of 140 million bushels for 1996-97 U.S. carryout.</p>
<p>Corn futures closed 1-1/2 to six cents per bushel higher, with March up six at $3.12. May closed 5-3/4 cents higher at $3.09-3/4 and December closed 3-1/2 higher at $2.91-1/2.</p>
