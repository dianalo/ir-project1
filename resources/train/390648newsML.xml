<p>A U.N. special envoy said on Thursday he exchanged views with Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila and agreed more talks on a five-point U.N. peace plan for Zaire.</p>
<p>Mohamed Sahnoun, the first joint U.N. and Organisation of African Unity envoy, declined to say at a news conference in Kigali how he had contact with Kabila, said by diplomatic sources to have been in the Rwandan capital on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not meet with Mr Kabila. But I did have some kind of contact. We exchanged views in specific ways just to be able to ascertain a number of things,&quot; said the Algerian diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;He understands the interest of the (U.N.) resolution. He had queries about what it contained for them (rebels). We agreed we would continue discussion on this subject. He did not press for any specific steps to be taken at this stage,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council in a resolution called on Tuesday for an immediate ceasefire in the central African state as part of a five-point U.N. peace plan after a request from Sahnoun.</p>
<p>Sahnoun was due later on Thursday to fly to Nairobi en route to Geneva, ending his first visit to central Africa since being appointed special envoy to the Great Lakes region in January.</p>
<p>His description of contacts with the rebel chief did little to dispel secrecy over Kabila's exact whereabouts since South African President Nelson Mandela revealed on Wednesday talks between the warring sides in Zaire would be held this week.</p>
<p>A government source said South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was leading a series of meetings in Cape Town on Thursday aiming to bring Kabila and Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko's nephew and chief security adviser together.</p>
<p>South African Director General of Foreign Affairs Rusty Evans, who said on Wednesday Kabila was in South Africa, stepped back on Thursday, saying he could not confirm or deny his presence.</p>
<p>Mandela said on Wednesday South Africa would send a plane for Kabila, and military sources said he was believed to have been on an aircraft that landed at a Cape Town air force base from Rwanda shortly before dawn.</p>
<p>Some diplomats said the talks were apparently meant to be secret and Mandela's announcement of them and the fact Kabila would leave for South Africa from Kigali instead of rebel-held territory had shocked the rebels and the Rwandan government.</p>
<p>The five-point U.N. peace plan included a ceasefire, the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including mercenaries, respect for the territorial integrity of Zaire and a peaceful settlement through dialogue and convening of an international conference.</p>
