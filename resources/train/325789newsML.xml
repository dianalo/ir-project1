<p>At just over 18,000 points, Japan's Nikkei-225 share index offers good value to foreign investors seeking to diversify their portfolios, but none is yet prepared to bet the market has finally turned up.</p>
<p>The Nikkei-225 bounced 3.78 percent on Wednesday to 18,013.88 and some commentators have said that the 17,000 level tested earlier this month may represent the bottom.</p>
<p>&quot;When these things are sentiment-driven it is very difficult to pick levels ... It might have bottomed at 17,000 but it might not,&quot; said Rod Birkett, who manages Britain's largest Japan investment trust, the Fleming Japanese Investment Trust Plc.</p>
<p>Some $400 billion was wiped off the value of the Japanese stock market from December 17, when the Nikkei-225 was at 20,413 points, and its January 10 nadir of 17,300.</p>
<p>&quot;Clients are itching to buy Japan because it has gone down so much, but they are searching very hard to find a reason,&quot; said Allison Southey, a global equity strategist at Nomura in London.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch's monthly survey of fund managers showed uniform negativity on Japan, with U.S., European and Japanese institutions ranking it amongst their least favoured markets.</p>
<p>In Merrill's survey, a balance of 24 percent of the 41 Japanese institutions managing $688 billion expected the Nikkei to turn lower during the next three months. But a balance of 36 percent expected it to be higher in 12 months.</p>
<p>&quot;The frightening thing in Japan is that they have done everything they can possibly do. The authorities have changed their fiscal stance, they have pared interest rates to the bone, pleaded with their own institutions to buy the market,&quot; said Nomura's Southey.</p>
<p>Now the challenge facing politicians and bureaucrats is a structural overhaul of the way Japan does business.</p>
<p>&quot;People are testing the resolve of the authorities and their desire to bring about long-term fundamental change in the economic structure of Japan,&quot; said Fleming's Birkett.</p>
<p>The authorities had a range of options from, at the radical end, redenominating the yen to deregulating swathes of the economy and encouraging corporate mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;It is instructive to look at the yen, which went from 100 to the dollar to 80 in 1995 and there was no telling where it would stop. The same is true of the stock market, except in reverse,&quot; Birkett said.</p>
<p>Another London-based fund manager noted that Wednesday's 655 point rally in Tokyo might be illusory as the market rose on the assumption that the government would scrap the tax on trading securities and so stimulate buying of equities.</p>
<p>&quot;This cuts both ways, it makes it easier to sell as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Most foreign investors believe that Japan will rally as many of its companies are exceptionally cheap in comparison with their global peers and moves tend to be extreme on any market moved by flows of funds,</p>
<p>&quot;There are no dividends on the market so you are not paid to sit there, you are only paid to make capital gains....or capital losses,&quot; said Fleming's Birkett.</p>
