<p>Ken Griffey Jr drove in two runs as the Seattle Mariners completed their first road sweep of the New York Yankees with a 3-2 victory Sunday.</p>
<p>The Mariners had never swept a series of any length at Yankee Stadium since entering the American League in 1977. They have won five straight games overall to climb to 16 games over .500 (60-44) for the first time in franchise history.</p>
<p>&quot;It came at a right time for us,&quot; Mariners manager Lou Piniella said of the sweep. &quot;We've got a day off tomorrow. We'll enjoy it a little more.&quot;</p>
<p>Griffey, who ended a long drought by homering in the first two games of the series, stroked a two-run single that completed a three-run third inning against Andy Pettitte (12-6). Griffey had three hits and is 7-for-14 lifetime against Pettitte, who had a four-game winning streak snapped.</p>
<p>Jeff Fassero (9-6) allowed two runs and eight hits in seven-plus innings for his first win in exactly a month. Bob Wells worked out of a ninth-inning jam for his second save.</p>
<p>&quot;I was pitching with a purpose to shut out the middle of the order,&quot; Fassero said. &quot;But sometimes you have a tendency to let down when you get to the bottom. This sweep shows what a great team we have.&quot;</p>
<p>The Yankees have lost three in a row and fell 5 1/2 games behind first-place Baltimore in the American League East.  The Mariners moved 3 1/2 games ahead of second-place Anaheim in the West.</p>
<p>In Boston, Wil Cordero's single in the bottom of the ninth scored John Valentin with the winning run as the Red Sox rallied for three runs and a victory in the final inning for the second straight game, defeating the Anaheim Angels 6-5.</p>
<p>The Angels also surrendered three runs in the ninth of the first game of the series Friday but hung on to win.</p>
<p>Jack Howell had his first multi-homer game in nearly six years for the Angels, who dropped the final two games of the series after sweeping Friday's doubleheader. Garret Anderson also homered for Anaheim while Nomar Garciaparra had a three-run blast for Boston.</p>
<p>At Minnesota, Scott Erickson threw a five-hitter for his 10th career shutout and Geronimo Berroa and B.J. Surhoff hit three-run homers as the Baltimore Orioles crushed the Twins 9-0.</p>
<p>Erickson (13-5) walked none and struck out a season-high nine in his first complete game this season.</p>
<p>Rich Robertson (7-8) had lost seven straight games.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Matt Karchner's wild pitch with two outs in the top of the seventh allowed Mark McLemore to score the go-ahead run as the Texas Rangers edged the White Sox 5-4 for their third straight victory.</p>
<p>Eric Gunderson (2-0) pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings of relief to get the win and John Wetteland pitched his way in and out of a jam in the ninth for his 22nd save in 28 chances.</p>
<p>Fernando Tatis hit his first major-league home run, McLemore added his first homer of the season and Will Clark blasted his 11th homer for Texas.</p>
<p>Frank Thomas hit a solo home run for the White Sox, who lost for the fourth time in five games and fell 5 1/2 games behind Cleveland in the American League Central.</p>
<p>In Cleveland, four pitchers combined on a six-hitter and Brian Giles drove in a pair of runs as the Indians posted a 4-2 victory over the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p>Jason Jacome pitched five solid innings in his third start of the year and first since July 11. Jacome (2-0) gave up both runs and four hits with two strikeouts and a walk. Jose Mesa had four strikeouts in three scoreless innings, Mike Jackson walked two and struck out one and Paul Assenmacher recorded the final two outs for his first save.</p>
<p>Oakland starter Jimmy Haynes (0-1) surrendered three runs -- two earned -- and five hits in 4 1/3 innings in his first appearance for the Athletics after being acquired from the Orioles a month ago in the Geronimo Berroa trade.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Dave Nilsson capped a big weekend with four hits and four RBI and Fernando Vina added three hits and two RBI, leading the Milwaukee Brewers to an 11-7 victory over the Tigers, completing a three-game sweep.</p>
<p>Nilsson had a single and scored in a two-run first inning, delivered a two-run double in a three-run fourth and smacked a two-run homer in a five-run ninth. He went 7-for-13 in the series with three homers and seven RBI.</p>
<p>The Brewers collected a season-high 18 hits off four pitchers and swept three at Detroit for the first time since 1991.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Johnny Damon singled in the go-ahead run in the top of the ninth as the Kansas City Royals rallied for a 3-2 win, ending the Blue Jays' five-game winning streak.</p>
<p>The Jays missed a chance at their first-ever 6-0 homestand.</p>
