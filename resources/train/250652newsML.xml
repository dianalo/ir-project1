<p>---------------------------(Dec 11)-----------------------------</p>
<p>*Stocks ended slightly weaker despite a surprise rate cut as resources weighed on the market. Volume 398.2 million shares, value A$925.0 million, 1,088 stocks traded, 336 steady, 415 up, 337 down.  </p>
<p>Australian shares closed slightly weaker on Wednesday, the market shrugging off early strength inspired by a surprise rate cut and focusing on the effect of a strong local currency on the resource sector and possible Wall Street weakness.</p>
<p>Citing an improved inflation outlook, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut official cash rates by 0.5 percent to 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>The benchmark All Ordinaries index closed 2.5 points weaker at 2,359.3 after reaching an intraday high of 2,385.4. December share price index futures ended up four points at 2,360, at a 0.7 point premium to the index.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was clear there was great euphoria this morning following the rate cut but banks in particular faded at the finish and it would appear that the cut was already well built into the market,&quot; said Kevin Lourey, a dealer at Melbourne broker Peake Lands Kirwin.</p>
<p>Lourey said although the Australian dollar lost about a cent after the easing, this was not enough to satisfy investors who are concerned about the negative effect the currency's strength is likely to have on the earnings of resource companies.</p>
<p>Dealers said another negative was a possible Dow pullback, noting the S&amp;P500 December contract's fall in Globex trade.  </p>
<p>The oil price was seen as a likely significant negative factor as world markets build in the effects of Iraq's resumption of crude oil exports.</p>
<p>Once again the bank sector was the most active area of the market. The majors had mixed fortunes with National Australia and Westpac ending lower, ANZ holding its ground and the Commonwealth closing slightly firmer.</p>
<p>FUTURES/OPTIONS - Futures and options business picked up as market volatility increased in response to the Reserve Bank's rate cut decision. Total options traded 42,953 (36,138)</p>
<p>Turnover in December SPI contracts 9,446 (6,042)  </p>
<p>In other local markets, bond yields closed lower, wiping out the heavy sell-off seen late last week following the rate cut.</p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped 30 basis points to around 7.08 percent on the easing but had subsequently rowed back to finish at 7.20 percent, down 0.17 percentage points on Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was hanging by its fingertips late Wednesday after the rate cut came like a bolt from the blue to topple it from 80 cents.</p>
<p>By 5.15 p.m.(0615 GMT), the unit was quoted at US$0.7912/17.  </p>
