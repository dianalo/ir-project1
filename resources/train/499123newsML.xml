<title>UK: FOCUS - US cold snap boosts grains, oil easier.</title>
<headline>FOCUS - US cold snap boosts grains, oil easier.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>US grain prices rose briskly on Thursday on forecasts for bitter cold weather in the US Plains and concerns of &quot;winter kill&quot; for the crops.</p>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) wheat futures were up seven to five cents per bushel in early trade with nearby May rising above $3.90.</p>
<p>CBOT soybean and corn futures opened higher in fast dealings, boosted by USDA weekly export sales that were well above trade expectations, trading floor sources said.</p>
<p>Wheat was further supported by forecasts for up to 10 inches of snow in key spring wheat planting areas. Farmers must wait for a massive snowpack to melt and soil to dry enough before they begin seeding spring wheat, traders said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in commodity markets palladium fell on word that delayed Russian exports to Japan may resume in May and crude oil was under pressure after a late Wednesday sell-off.</p>
<p>The palladium price had climbed to a 21-month high in London early on Thursday as worries over supply gripped the market.</p>
<p>The concern arose from an administrative snarl-up in Russia, the biggest seller, which has stopped exports since last November. The price has increased by 40 percent since then.</p>
<p>But selling began on a statement from a senior Russian Ministry of Finance official that shipments to Japan, the world's leading importer, could begin next month.</p>
<p>Palladium fixed at $155.50 per ounce, down from $160.25.</p>
<p>The rare white metal is used in electronic components and is a key element in the catalytic converters which neutralise noxious gases in car exhausts.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $347.60 against $348.05 earlier.</p>
<p>Crude oil was under pressure in a market that began to take a less rosy view of upcoming US gasoline demand. North Sea Brent Blend crude futures, a world benchmark, for May were trading around $17.70 per barrel late in London's day, down almost 50 cents from Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>London cocoa futures rose on buying by the trade and a cessation of the recent wave of selling by speculative funds.</p>
