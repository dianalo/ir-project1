<title>UK: British business should accept minimum wage-report.</title>

<p>A business think-tank containing a number of influential names in British industry on Monday said business leaders should accept a national minimum wage and employment legislation from the European Union's Social Chapter.</p>
<p>It also said the &quot;roller-coaster&quot; macroeconomy would benefit from a more independent Bank of England and an economic growth target alongside the existing inflation target.</p>
<p>The report, &quot;Promoting Prosperity&quot;, was written by the Commission of Public Policy and British Business and includes British Aerospace chairman Bob Bauman, managing director of GEC George Simpson and chief executive of United News and Media, Lord Hollick.</p>
<p>The report said a minimum wage would help prevent employers exploiting in-work benefits for the low paid.</p>
<p>&quot;A minimum wage should be introduced to prevent (in work- benefits) being exploited by unscrupulous employers at the tax payers' expense,&quot; it said. &quot;The minimum wage should not be set too high since it destroys jobs in some sectors.&quot;</p>
<p>Confidence in economic stability would improve if the Bank of England had more independence, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;(And) in order to maintain stable conditions of monetary demand, there is a strong case for targeting both growth and inflation through a nominal GDP target.&quot;</p>
<p>The Treasury has the final say on interest rate moves in Britain with the Bank of England providing only an advisory role.</p>
<p>The Commission was set up by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research and gives overt backing to some of the opposition Labour Party's key economic policies, such as the minimum wage.</p>
<p>The report attacked Britain's competitiveness and said stiffer penalties for anti-competitive behaviour were needed.</p>
<p>&quot;The current government has failed British business by dragging its feet on promised reforms of UK competition policy,&quot; the report said.</p>
