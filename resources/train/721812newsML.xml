<p>ABLETT: THE END OF AN ENIGMA.</p>
<p>The curtain looks ready to fall on the career of one of the game's greatest ever players, Gary Ablett.</p>
<p>Beset by advancing years, personal problems and injury, the football life of the man they call God seems beyond resurrection.</p>
<p>Ablett, 35, requires a knee reconstruction to play again and off the field friends fear he is treading a path to self-destruction.</p>
<p>A string of disputes between him, the club and his management for failing to honour football and sponsorship committments prompted calls from Geelong officials this week for his retirement.</p>
<p>It would be an inappropriate end to a great career which yielded more than 1,000 goals in almost 250 games.</p>
<p>Anyone who saw Ablett play, especially those lucky enough to see the epic 1989 Grand Final against Hawthorn where Ablett kicked nine goals, will salute a football genius.</p>
<p>BUT LET THE GAMES BEGIN.</p>
<p>The Ablett saga will pale into insignificance for Geelong supporters when the Cats take to the MCG tonight for the clash with North Melbourne who have lost their past two matches.</p>
<p>The Kangaroos are Friday night MCG specialists and a win is imperative to keep them in touch with the top four from where they could mount a genuine premiership defence.</p>
<p>In their win over Collingwood last week the Cats were profligate in front of goal kicking 26 behinds but got the ball into their forward line enough to suggest they may have too many scoring options for the Roos who may still be a little leg weary from their past two outings.</p>
<p>After Essendon beat Melbourne last week Bomber coach Kevin Sheedy suggested the Demons would upset a few teams before the end of the season.</p>
<p>It was wishful thinking by Sheedy who needs Melbourne to beat Carlton on Saturday at the MCG to clear a path for his team to the finals.</p>
<p>The Blues were outclassed by the Western Bulldogs last week but will be untroubled by the Demons who may be able to buy the best administrators like erstwhile Essendon football manager Danny Corcoran but not the four premiership points.</p>
<p>DOGS' DANGER GAME</p>
<p>Saturday's encounter with Brisbane at Optus Oval is a danger game for the top of the ladder Western Bulldogs whose three losses at the ground this season have all been to interstate teams.</p>
<p>While Brisbane's only win outside Queensland this year is against lowly Melbourne, the Lions, winners in their past three matches, are starting to gather some momentum and are capable of more than their dismal road record suggests.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs however have the football world convinced of their legitimacy and with star forward Chris Grant in brilliant form, should be too strong.</p>
<p>MAGPIE NEST CONDEMNED</p>
<p>Collingwood plays Fremantle on Saturday in what could be the Magpies' last ever AFL game at Victoria Park.</p>
<p>A report to the league during the week condemned the ground and its hostile environs as a health hazard.</p>
<p>Fremantle's recent form - two wins in its past three matches - is better that Collingwood's - six straight losses- but the Magpies at home will be too strong.</p>
<p>In what is shaping of the match of the round Adelaide and St Kilda, two of the competition's form sides, meet at Football Park on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The Saints dispensed with the reigning premier last week in an emphatic display and with Jason Heatley fresh from a bag of goals and strong marking Stuart Loewe and Peter Everitt in the forward line, they have abundant goal-scoring potential.</p>
<p>Adelaide has plenty of avenues to goal too and a midfield of Jarman, Bickley and Ricciuto to rival the Saints star midfielders in Burke, Harvey and Winmar.</p>
<p>At home they should just sneak home.</p>
<p>Sydney hosts Essendon on Saturday night in a replay of last year's epic final where a Tony Lockett behind after the final siren put the Swans into the grand final.</p>
<p>The Bombers, depleted by injury for most of the year, have welcomed back a succession of stars in the past few weeks and have managed to string some badly needed wins together, albeit against the bottom two clubs Richmond and Melbourne.</p>
<p>After two games in atrocious weather conditions and an eight day break the Swans, who are undefeated in their past 17 games at home, should win a thriller.</p>
<p>Hawthorn, chasing its sixth straight win, plays Richmond at the MCG on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Hawks, who have not beaten the Tigers since 1994, are playing an irresistible brand of football and a win on Sunday looks a mere formality against an opposition in disarray.</p>
<p>However the Tigers fight hardest when they are wounded and with Richardson, Gale and Charles, have enough height up forward to worry the Hawks. Hawthorn in a close one.</p>
<p>West Coast, smarting from three straight defeats, plays Port Adealaide at Subiaco Oval on Sunday afternoon in a must win game for both clubs.</p>
<p>Logic says the Eagles will win but it's hard to pick them with any real conviction, especially against the fledgling Power who almost reeled in a rampant Hawthorn last week after conceding a 12 goal start.</p>
