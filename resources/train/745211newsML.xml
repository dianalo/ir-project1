<p>Britain's B.A.T Industries agreed on Tuesday to buy Mexico's largest cigarette maker, Cigarerra La Moderna, for $1.7 billion in a move aimed at sealing its dominance in Latin America's lucrative cigarette market.</p>
<p>B.A.T said buying the Mexican company from Empresas La Moderna SA de CV would reinforce its dominance in the Latin American cigarette market where it now holds a 60 percent share -- roughly double that of its major U.S. rival, Philip Morris Cos Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;Latin America is a very key market for us. This rounds out our Latin American investment,&quot; chief executive Martin Broughton told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico is a profitable market and a long-term prospect market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>B.A.T expected the deal to add $140 million to its trading profits in 1998 and have a broadly neutral effect on earnings in the first full year.</p>
<p>B.A.T's shares surged 15 pence to close at about 532.5 pence.</p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition is a good fit given B.A.T's interest in North and Latin America,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;Providing it does not put too much strain on the balance sheet -- which I don't think it will -- it could be mildly earnings positive,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The acquisition formed part of B.A.T's strategy to expand in less-developed regions such as Central Europe and Asia -- particularly in light of growing opposition to smoking in the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not exclusively in what people used to refer to as the Third World, but that's where the best growth opportunities are, so that comes pretty high up on the agenda,&quot; Broughton said, noting that B.A.T has always had a presence in less-developed countries.</p>
<p>CLM has about 53 percent of the Mexican cigarette market, which ranked as the 15th largest in the world with about 47 billion cigarettes total, B.A.T said.</p>
<p>The Mexican company, with a 1996 pro forma trading profit of $80 million on revenues of $794 million, owns three of the top five brands in the Mexican market -- Raleigh, Boots and Montana.</p>
<p>B.A.T, which has operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and other countries, had annual sales of more than 174 billion cigarettes in Latin America last year and reaped a trading profit of 245 million pounds ($410 million) from the region in 1996.</p>
<p>The CLM acquisition marked B.A.T's re-entry into the Mexican tobacco market after government legislation in that country in the 1970s forced it to cut its majority holding in Empresas La Moderna.</p>
<p>B.A.T finally sold its remaining minority stake in Empresas La Moderna in 1989.</p>
<p>Under the CLM deal, B.A.T would receive 50 percent of the share capital of CLM and acquire the two statutory qualifying shares.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, CLM would get an option to redeem the rest of its shares held by Empresas La Moderna. On the exercise of that option, B.A.T would wholly own CLM.</p>
<p>B.A.T said the acquisition price consisted of $1.0 billion in cash, a loan note of $500 million, and the assumption of about $212 million of CLM debt.</p>
<p>B.A.T planned to fund the buy from its own resources, increasing its debt/equity ratio to an estimated 65 percent at year-end 1997, before taking account of current U.S. tobacco proposals.</p>
<p>That level compared to current gearing in the high-30s range.</p>
<p>CLM currently has spare manufacturing capacity for some 15 billion cigarettes, which could help B.A.T boost its export business.</p>
<p>In addition, B.A.T saw considerable opportunities for leaf exports from Mexico, particularly because the country is outside the U.S. import quota.</p>
<p>Broughton said he did not see any need for restructuring or layoffs at CLM.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very well run, efficient business,&quot; he said, adding that B.A.T did not currently have any other acquisitions in the pipeline. ($ = 0.597 British Pounds)</p>
