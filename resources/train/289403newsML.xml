<headline>Swiss shares end easier, banks weak.</headline>
<text>
<p>1605 GMT - Swiss shares ended weaker on Monday in a market which favoured industrial shares but were negative toward banks and insurers lower, dealers said.</p>
<p>* Broad SPI down 5.92 points to 2,506.22.</p>

<p>Shares in UBS fell 21 Swiss francs to 1,149. CS Group shed 2.75 to 133.75. SBC fell 1.50 to 252.40.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the maket worried that U.S. institutional investors could withdraw funds under management by Swiss banks.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one reason for investment funds taking their leave from bank shares,&quot; one Zurich trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market lacked power for further gains and many investors worried about a possible setback.</p>
<p>Insurers followed bank shares lower, with Swiss Re losing 17 francs to end at 1,406. Zurich lost 4.50 to finish at 363.50.</p>
<p>Nestle fell nine francs to 1,421.  </p>

<p>Trade on Soffex saw rising interest in options on bank shares. Early trade saw bank dealers writing calls. Later when banks shares were lower put options were sold.</p>
<p>Otherwise the market was quiet, dealers said.</p>
<p>127,455 options were traded at a call-put-ratio of 1.66:1. Volatilities were rising.</p>
