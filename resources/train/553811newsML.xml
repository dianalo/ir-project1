<title>USA: Murdered girl's parents meet with U.S. reporters.</title>
<headline>Murdered girl's parents meet with U.S. reporters.</headline>
<dateline>BOULDER, Colo. 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The parents of JonBenet Ramsey agreed to meet a select group of reporters Thursday, one day after the couple sat down formally with police for the first time to answer questions about their daughter's murder.</p>
<p>Local media said the Ramseys were meeting with six reporters at an undisclosed location. A reporter for the Denver Post said the journalists were contacted by cellular phone and given the location for the secret meeting.</p>
<p>A spokesman retained by the family was not available to comment on the unusual method of calling a news conference.</p>
<p>John and Patricia Ramsey met separately with two detectives and a representative of the Boulder County District Attorney's office Wednesday, the first time in four months they had a formal interview with police.</p>
<p>No further details of the questioning were made public, but news reports said the meeting took place at the D.A.'s office and Mrs Ramsey was questioned for about six hours and her husband for two hours.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made and no suspects named in the murder of the child beauty pageant contestant. The 6-year-old girl's body was found Dec. 26 by her father in the basement of the family's home, about eight hours after her mother said she found a ransom note demanding $118,000.</p>
<p>Since then, the parents' lawyers have been negotiating terms of any interviews with investigators, who have taken several examples of Mrs. Ramsey's handwriting.</p>
<p>Last week, after police said the parents were the focus of the murder investigation, attorneys for the parents said police cancelled interviews that had been scheduled and they accused police of waging a &quot;smear&quot; campaign against them.</p>
<p>A later conciliatory letter from police to the Ramseys' lawyers said officials &quot;acknowledge the unfortunate miscommunication.&quot; But police reiterated several conditions they deemed necessary to conduct the interviews.</p>
<p>They insisted on interviewing the parents separately, with the mother first, and refused to put a time limit on the interviews, which were to be tape recorded. Police agreed to conduct the interviews at a &quot;neutral location.&quot;</p>
