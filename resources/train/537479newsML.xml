<p>The Royal Dutch-Shell Group said on Thursday its global coal interests would be consolidated into a new wholly-owned international company, based in Australia.</p>
<p>The new company, Shell Coal, will oversee the group's coal businesses including exploration and mining as well as pursuing opportunities in coal-fired power generation, Shell Australia Ltd said in a statement.</p>
<p>Current coal corporate functions in London and Melbourne will be relocated to Brisbane, Queensland while coal marketing would continue from Sydney and London, a Shell spokesman said.  </p>
<p>The decision to establish the new company in Australia followed a review of Shell's global coal business which confirmed the group had world-class assets and was in a strong position position to expand in hard coal markets and power generation, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Shell was Australia's third biggest coal producer with management of the Drayton and Dartbrook thermal coal mines and South Bulli coking coal mine in New South Wales.</p>
<p>In Queensland, Shell had 66.7 percent of the Callide thermal coal mine and 46.75 percent of German Creek coking coal output.  </p>
<p>Construction of the Moranbah North hard coking coal mine was underway in north Queensland with new developments including the Theodore and Dawson thermal coal deposits, Grosvenor coking coal deposit and a power generation project, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, Shell had a 24.7 percent interest in a mine at Paso Diablo in Zulia and a similar interest in the nearby Sacuy reserves.</p>
