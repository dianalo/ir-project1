<p>International rally chiefs forecast a golden future with increased excitement for spectators when the sport undergoes a revolution in format, television coverage and rules next season.</p>
<p>David Richards, the man behind the Subaru team's success as manufacturers' champions this year, believes rallying has been waiting for a revolution for many years.</p>
<p>And he is delighted it has now been guided through by Max Mosley, president of the sport's ruling body, the International Motoring Federation (FIA).</p>
<p>&quot;In all walks of life, progress is achieved by change which is in turn dictated by lessons learnt,&quot; said Richards. &quot;World championship rallying is one of the most popular global sporting events, but it is time now for substantial revisions in order to raise the profile of all concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>Richards praised the decision to increase the number of rounds in the championship from nine to 14 in 1997, saying it would now &quot;represent a truly global series which will be far more in the public eye and capable of capturing media attention.</p>
<p>&quot;The world rally championship has been engulfed in politics and traditionalism for far too long and now is the time to put those ideas behind us and start promoting a bright new future.&quot;</p>
<p>Mosley, who engineered the sweeping reformation which will bring in the new cars, more closely based on ordinary road cars, new rules and new calendar, said he had framed the changes to &quot;cut costs and minimise the strain on top drivers&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared to 1991,&quot; he said, &quot;manufacturers are committed to using near-standard recce (reconnaissance) cars, which are much cheaper. Fewer opportunities for servicing has led to improved reliability and less need to carry large quantities of expensive spares.</p>
<p>&quot;Shorter recces means that drivers and co-drivers need spend little more than a week on each rally. Until limits were intoduced, they could easily spend two or three weeks just practising. They will spend less time in rally cars than they did five years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>By increasing the calendar from nine to 14 rallies, and by making every team take part in every rally, Mosley believes the sport will benefit through improved media coverage and by being taken more seriously</p>
<p>&quot;Every team in Formula One accepts that it has to take part in every race and that the sport is better for it,&quot; he said. &quot;Rallying will not be taken seriously by the media if it cannot guarantee the top cars and drivers will turn up for every event.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the main changes will see the replacement of the former 'group A' cars, based on specialist competition vehicles with a production run of at least 2,500, with a new formula car designed for road cars which are part of a production run of at least 25,000.</p>
<p>The cars created by the new rules will be based on a two-litre, turbo-charged, four-wheel drive mid-sized family saloon with a minimum weight of 1230 kgs.</p>
<p>&quot;These changes are going to bring in a whole new era,&quot; said Mosley. &quot;I think that these kind of cars will fascinate the public and then we will see rallies going to other parts of the world, including new countries such as China.&quot;</p>
<p>The new breed of cars for the future will be called 'world rally cars' and, the ruling body hopes, they will make it easier for the public to identify with the competition vehicles they see being driven in rallies by Colin McRae or 1996 world champion Tommi Makinen.</p>
<p>But each of the many manufacturers that the FIA hopes will be attracted to the sport by its new image, smaller budgets and revised rule-book will have to produce a minimum of 20 world rally cars, based on a mass-produced model, which comply to the new formula.</p>
<p>&quot;This new formula, essentially, takes all of the best elements of the group A cars of the past and combines them in one optimised formula,&quot; said the Subaru team's technical director David Lapworth. &quot;In many ways, you could say a world rally car is the best of all group A cars put together.&quot;</p>
<p>The creation of a rule-book based on this kind of formula will, according to Lapworth, allow performance improvements to be found during the season, as they are in Formula One, but only in controlled and permitted areas.</p>
<p>The cars also have only to belong to a 'family' of the same car which sells more than 25,000 each year.</p>
<p>This will, he said, prove far less restrictive and less expensive than the old group A rules which required a manufacturer to produce 2,500 idential 'special' cars in which all the key components were the same, for the road cars, as they were on the competing rally car.</p>
<p>&quot;This sounded straightforward,&quot; said Lapworth.&quot;But producing 2,500 hybrid road cars is risky, costly and limits the available number of manufacturers in the sport.</p>
<p>The new regulations make life much easier...and will help create a much tighter level of competition in the future. That will be good for everyone involved.&quot;</p>
