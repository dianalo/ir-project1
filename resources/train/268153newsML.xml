<headline>Jobless claims inch higher in latest week.</headline>

<p>The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits edged up slightly last week to the highest level since July, the government said Thursday.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said claims for first-time jobless benefits rose to 351,000 in the week ended December 14, up 1,000 from the previous week. Wall Street economists had forecast initial jobless claims of 331,000.</p>
<p>The claims were the highest since the week ended July 13, when they reached 367,000, the department said.</p>
<p>The department initially had reported a drop in claims for the week ended December 7. But after detecting a large reporting error by an unspecified state, it said Thursday that it revised the claims figure to 350,000 from the earlier reported 317,000.</p>
<p>The four-week moving average, considered to be a more accurate gauge of employment trends than the weekly figure, also inched higher in the week ended December 14. It stood at 342,500, up from 342,250.</p>
<p>The department said 20 states reported increases in claims exceeding 1,000 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended December 7, the latest period for which data were available.</p>
<p>Among the largest were California, with 27,831 more claims; North Carolina, with 13,835; Pennsylvania, with 12,974; Michigan, with 8,450; Illinois, with 6,429; New York, with 6,385; and Georgia, with 6,345.</p>
<p>California attributed the large jump in claims to the return to a five-day work week after a holiday week, as well as layoffs in construction and agriculture.</p>
<p>North Carolina reported layoffs in construction, textile, apparel and furniture industries. Pennsylvania had layoffs in construction, food, lumber, transportation, transportation equipment and service industries.</p>
<p>Michigan reported layoffs in the automobile industry, while Illinois had layoffs in construction and service industries and in manufacturing. New York reported layoffs in the construction industry while Georgia had layoffs in the textile, apparel and carpet industries.</p>
<p>Labour said two states reported decreases in initial claims exceeding 1,000, unadjusted, in the December 7 week.</p>
<p>Wisconsin, with 7,458 fewer claims, had a decrease in layoffs in the construction, trade and service industries and in manufacturing. Texas, with 4,053, provided no explanation for the drop in claims.</p>
