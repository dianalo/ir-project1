<p>The Singapore high sulphur fuel oil prices edged higher on Monday amid fresh buying demand as well as crude gains, traders said.</p>
<p>After four cargoes exchanged hands last week, traders said they expected increased interest this week.</p>
<p>A 180-cst cargo for July 19-23 lifting was traded at $101.50 per tonne, compared with Friday's trading level at $100.00 and $101.00 per tonne.</p>
<p>Two related Singapore traders bought three cargoes last week and the market was expecting continued demand from them.  </p>
<p>One of the two traders said the company is looking to cover some of its short positions.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the local trader is pretty keen in buying. But we have to wait for a few days to see if his buying will continue,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) said on Monday it had bought through tender at least one 38,000-tonne cargo of 0.5-percent sulphur fuel oil for delivery between July 21 and August 15.</p>
<p>CPC bought the low-pour fuel oil at above $127 per tonne on a cost-and-freight Kaohsiung basis, a CPC official said.  </p>
<p>In its last purchase, CPC bought two 38,000-tonne cargoes of of low-sulphur fuel oil, with the low-pour cargo at $129 per tonne and the high-pour cargo at $123, for July deliveries.</p>
<p>A company source said CPC might not seek further fuel oil imports in the near term.</p>
<p>The swaps market inched up also over fresh buying demand from the physical market.</p>
<p>July swaps were at $99.25/$100.00 against Friday's $98.00/$99.00 and August swaps were at $98.25/$99.00 against $97.75/$98.50.  </p>
