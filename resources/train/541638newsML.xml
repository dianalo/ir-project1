<headline>Turkish minister says he will resign in Islam row.</headline>

<p>A Turkish minister from the conservative wing of the Islamist-led coalition said on Saturday he was to resign in a government dispute over implementation of anti-Islamist military demands, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of respect for myself and the Turkish people I will give my resignation to the prime minister,&quot; Trade and Industry Minister Yalim Erez was quoted as saying by the state-run agency.</p>
<p>He was speaking after 30 minutes of talks with Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, his party leader.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I told the chairwoman that the government will not benefit the country and democracy if it continues in this way,&quot; Erez said.</p>
<p>Erez and another minister from the True Path Party had already expressed open opposition to the Islamist Welfare Party of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan for stalling on military demands for a crackdown on religious activism.</p>
<p>The National Security Council, chaired by President Suleyman Demirel, was to meet later on Saturday for talks expected to focus on army orders to restrict religious education, penalise Islamist dress and move against Islamist business.</p>
<p>Leading newspapers said Ciller warned Erbakan on Friday that she would pull out of government unless his party agreed to the military requests.</p>
<p>Before her meeting with Erbakan on Friday, Ciller denied a press report that she would withdraw her party from modern Turkey's first Islamist-led government.</p>
<p>Talks were likely to deal with a key army demand, opposed by the Welfare Party, that the state's secularist education be extended to eight years from five, media reports said.</p>
<p>The planned education reforms would marginalise religious secondary schools, breeding ground of future Islamists.</p>
