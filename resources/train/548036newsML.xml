<p>A British maritime lawyer had advised tanker owners to amend charter party agreements to take into account possible delays caused by deepening of the Houston Ship Channel this summer.</p>
<p>Sinclair, Roche &amp; Temperley has advised Intertanko, the organisation which represents 70 percent of the world's independent tanker owners, that &quot;the general position is best dealt with by a clause&quot; covering the effect of navigational delays from the work.</p>
<p>The Port of Houston Authority has obtained approval from the U.S. government to deepen the Channel to 45 feet, from 40 feet. Work expected to commence in mid July and to last for about 15 weeks.</p>
<p>Intertanko said one of its members had raised concerns that works to remove the tunnel as part of the dredging operation would require 55 channel closures of up to 12 hours at a time during daylight hours.</p>
<p>Harvey Williams of Sinclair, Roche &amp; Temperley said the clause should include wording to the effect that: &quot;Laytime and demurrage shall be calculated as if the vessel had been able to reach the designated berth without being affected by any delay&quot; when ships were delayed from reaching berths to which they have been ordered in the Houston Ship Channel due to work connected to the removal of the Baytown Tunnel or navigational difficulties resulting from it.</p>
<p>The unidentified shipowner had said its Aframax vessels were restricted to navigating the Houston Ship Channel during daylight hours, and it feared it might face several delays. --Paul Berrill, Reuters Shipping News + 44 171 542 4087</p>
