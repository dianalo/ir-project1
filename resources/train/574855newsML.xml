<p>Archbishop Laurent Pasinya Monsengwo, voted speaker of the transitional parliament in Zaire, said on Sunday he would accept the post provided certain conditions were met.</p>
<p>&quot;I will only accept if I have national and international guarantees,&quot; he told a news conference in Brussels during a stopover on his way back to Kinshasa from the Vatican where he attended a conference. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Zaire lawmakers on Saturday voted Monsengwo as speaker of the transitional parliament, making him a potential interim successor to ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is battling cancer as well as a rebellion led by Laurent Kabila.</p>
<p>Foreign diplomats involved in trying to broker a peaceful resolution to the seven-month-old conflict in Zaire see the post of speaker as crucial to any settlement.</p>
<p>The vote, conducted by a show of hands, was marred by a prior walkout by the UDPS radical opposition party of Etienne Tshisekedi, and it was not clear whether a quorum was achieved nor whether the &quot;consensus&quot; vote would prove binding.</p>
<p>According to Zaire's transition constitution, the speaker of parliament succeeds the president in the event of his death or incapacity.</p>
<p>The post has been vacant since a combined move by Mobutu followers and MPs of the radical opposition ousted Monsengwo two years ago.</p>
<p>At the time Mobutu's followers accused the popular archbishop of being too close to the opposition, while Tshisekedi's followers said he was weak in the face of Zaire's president of three decades.</p>
<p>The UDPS on Friday reiterated objections to Monsengwo's candidacy, calling him a &quot;Mobutist.&quot;</p>
<p>However, according to many Zaireans he is one of the few leading figures with the popular credibility and reputation for neutrality necessary to arbitrate among the country's politicians.</p>
<p>His appointment would allow Mobutu the possibility of standing down without leaving a power vacuum in his wake.</p>
<p>Some diplomats and political leaders say it would provide the ailing president the dignified exit necessary to forge an agreement between Zaire's warring factions.</p>
<p>Rebels say any peace agreement should involve Mobutu's resignation and a direct handover of power to Kabila.</p>
<p>At a meeting in Gabon on Saturday with South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Mobutu agreed to talks on Wednesday on board a South African ship with Kabila, whose fighters are moving closer to the Zairean capital.</p>
