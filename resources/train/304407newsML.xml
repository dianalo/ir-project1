<p>Stocks ended Monday's trading at the previous day's closing level as fears over strikes matched improving sentiment from falling margin loans, brokers said.</p>
<p>South Korea is faced with the biggest strikes ever on Wednesday when the nation's two main union umbrella groups plan to call out an all-out strike in protest at a new labour law.</p>
<p>The composite index ended flat at a provisional 659.54 after having fluctuated from 655.74 to 664.95.</p>
<p>&quot;Strikes kept bothering investors, but many people refrained from panicking on hopes that a last-minute solution could be reached,&quot; said Park Byung-moon of LG Securities.  </p>
<p>Brokers said investors are expecting a correction early this week following the past four consecutive days of rally.</p>
<p>The recent rises were led by bank and other financial shares on speculation that mergers and acquisitions would be active in line with the proposed plan to restructure the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Bank and securities house stocks were the first targets for correction as they were first to spark the rally,&quot; said Yoo Nam-gil, an analyst at Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>The financial sector sub-index shed 1.33 percent, or 8.47 points, to 629.14.  </p>
<p>The speculation followed President Kim Young-sam's remarks early last week that a special panel would be established soon to oversee restructuring of the financial industry. But details have yet to be drawn up.</p>
<p>Brokers said outstanding margin loans owed to brokerage houses have been falling while customer deposits started increasing last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The narrowing gap between margin loans and customer deposits is a very positive sign. But the possibility of strikes is blocking the improvement from being realised,&quot; said Yoo of Hyundai Securities.  </p>
<p>Margin loans fell to 2.59 trillion won from about 2.8 trillion won late last year while customer deposits increased to 2.57 trillion won from around 2.4 trillion won, brokers said.</p>
<p>The nationwide strikes have crippled much of South Korean industry in protest at the forced parliamentary passage of a new labour law on December 26.</p>
<p>The outlawed Korean Confederation of Trade Unions has said its 500,000 members would go on an all-out strike from Wednesday if the law was not scrapped. That coincides with a call by the 1.2 million-strong Federation of Korean Trade Unions to strike on Tuesday and Wednesday. --YOO CHOON-SIK (822) 727 5646</p>
