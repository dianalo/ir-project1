<headline>British Steel to unveil major job loss plans.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-20</dateline>

<p>British Steel Plc warned on Thursday it planned &quot;significantly more&quot; than 5,000 jobs cuts over the next five years at a cost which will run to &quot;tens of millions of pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the group said the relentless rise of sterling against the mark was the primary reason behind its drastic plan. It would not close production plants, but would scale back operations across the board, he said, with plans due to kick in in the next financial year.  </p>
<p>British Steel refused to comment on a report in The Guardian newspaper which put the job losses as high as 10,000 over five years. The spokesman said that no definite figure would be presented to trade unions in a meeting on Friday to discuss the plans.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not putting a figure on it tomorrow. But since privatisation we have cut up to 1,000 jobs each year. We are now talking of significantly more than that over the next five years.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the jobs losses will be in the UK. The strong pound was mostly to blame, he said. &quot;It was at 2.25 marks for a long time and helped us make profits of 1.1 billion (pounds) ($160.3 million). Since then it has gone up as high as 2.75 and for every 10 pfennigs the pound gains, our profits drop by 100 million (pounds).&quot;</p>
<p>Eighty percent of British Steel's profits are mark-exposed. He said the group was hit in European export markets by the strong pound and in the home market where cheaper overseas competitors were able to scoop up sales with lower priced steel. ($ = 0.624 British Pounds)</p>
