<p>A dolphin has been returned to Cuba from Chile after Chilean ecologists fought a legal battle to free it from a privately-run dolphinarium because it was not thriving, local media said on Monday.</p>
<p>The male dolphin, seven-year-old Menique, was shown on Monday on Cuban state television in its new pool at the national acquarium in Havana after being flown back on Sunday night. Authorities said it would be cared for there and later released to its natural habitat in Cuban waters.</p>
<p>Menique was sent by Cuba to Chile in 1995 along with another dolphin, Dragon. In exchange, Cuba received four sea lions. According to the official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, Dragon died of an infection, while Menique was not kept in good condition.</p>
<p>Prensa Latina said a group of Chilean ecologists went to court against the private firm, Arte America, that was housing Menique and won an order for his release. Prensa Latina did not specify what was wrong with the conditions at the dolphinarium in the northern city of Iquique.</p>
<p>Officials at Havana acquarium were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Menique was accompanied to Cuba by Chilean Maria Teresa Henriquez, president of an animal protection society in Iquique. &quot;I am sure I am leaving this animal in good hands,&quot; she told Prensa Latina.</p>
<p>Herminia Serrano, who adminsters Cuba's adherence to the International Convention for the Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), said that since the dolphin exchange in 1995, Cuba had tightened procedures and now required guarantees from a host country on the conditions an exported animal would be kept in.</p>
<p>She added dolphins were sufficiently common around Cuba's coasts for the island to have set a limit of up to 15 dolphins for sale each year, although it did not actually export this many.</p>
