<p>By Gail Appleson, U.S. Law Correspondent</p>
<p>Three radical Moslems were convicted on Thursday of plotting &quot;48 hours of terror in the sky&quot; by bombing a dozen U.S. jets and killing thousands of passengers to punish the United States for supporting Israel.</p>
<p>Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the alleged mastermind of the plot, and two other defendants, Abdul Hakim Murad and Wali Khan Amin Shah, face mandatory sentences of life in prison.</p>
<p>Yousef, one of the world's most wanted fugitives until he was arrested last year in Islamabad, Pakistan, is also accused of plotting the World Trade Centre bombing.</p>
<p>This case was the third to grow out of the 1993 bombing. All have ended in convictions and been seen as resounding victories for the U.S. government.</p>
<p>The federal jury deliberated three days. The trial started in May.</p>
<p>Manhattan U.S. attorney Mary Jo White said the defendants were planning &quot;48 hours of terror in the sky ... the horror of it is almost impossible to understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Terrorists are a global threat. They must be combatted, as in this case, with a global response,&quot; she said. &quot;The countries of the world must unite in finding, prosecuting and punishing every person -- of whatever nationality and ideology -- who commits terrorist acts. Our response must be clear and unrelenting.&quot;</p>
<p>The prosecutors' victory drew praise from the White House.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted to see that justice was done by this jury. It sends a message that no terrorist can hide from U.S. justice.&quot; said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.</p>
<p>Yousef was named as the architect of a scheme to murder about 4,000 passengers over a two-day period as they returned on Delta, Northwest and United flights to the United States from the Far East. Prosecutors said he recruited co-defendants Murad and Shah to participate in the scheme.</p>
<p>None of the three showed any emotion when the verdicts were read in the crowded Manhattan courtroom. Their attorneys said all three planned to appeal. Sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 5.</p>
<p>Yousef also was convicted of placing a bomb on a Philippine Airlines flight to Tokyo on Dec. 11, 1994, as a trial run. The bomb exploded under the seat of a Japanese passenger, killing him and injuring 10 other people.</p>
<p>White said the government plans to try Yousef next year on charges stemming from the World Trade Centre bombing, which killed six people and injured more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Roy Kulcsar, a legal adviser to Yousef, who acted as his own attorney, said outside the court that Yousef would have trouble getting a fair trial in the Trade Centre case. &quot;Every time you have a terrorism trial, it has an impact on the next terrorism trial. It will be very hard to get a jury that will be able to to say they are fair and impartial,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Attorney David Greenfield, who represented Shah, said he remained convinced the jurors were affected by the TWA Flight 800 explosion. The government's presentation of evidence entered a crucial phase in July at about the same time as the TWA Boeing 747 exploded off Long Island, New York, killing all 230 passengers and crew on board.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy asked jurors whether their judgment had been affected by the disaster. They denied being influenced by it, but Greenfield said, &quot;It's in their subconscious. It certainly played a part. To say otherwise, you're burying your head in the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>The plot to blow up 12 airliners was discovered in January 1995 when a fire broke out in an apartment shared by Yousef and Murad in Manila. When Philippine police searched it, they found explosives, bomb-making manuals, timers and a laptop computer with flight information, detonation times and a letter claiming responsibility for the planned bombings.</p>
<p>Yousef, who fled to Pakistan after the fire, argued that Philippine police fabricated the evidence and he was the victim of a conspiracy by Filipino and Pakistani authorities aimed at winning praise from the U.S. government.</p>
