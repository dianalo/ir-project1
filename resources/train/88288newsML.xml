<title>HONG KONG: Hong Kong securities oversight satisfactory - survey.</title>
<headline>Hong Kong securities oversight satisfactory - survey.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-10-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hong Kong's securities regulatory framework is perceived to be satisfactory, but the stock exchange said respondents to a survey were dissatisfied with insider trading and price-manipulating trading rules.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's Secondary Market Survey 1996, conducted in June, found that of the participating fund managers 60 percent considered regulation on insider trading to be loose. Less than half of all respondents agreed that it was appropriate.</p>
<p>On the issue of price manipulating trading activities, 70 percent of all fund managers responding said they considered such activities as underregulated.</p>
<p>Brokers' responses showed they were less concerned about these issues.</p>
<p>Those surveyed included trading members of the exchange, Hong Kong-based fund managers and non-exchange member participants in the Centralised Clearing and Settlement System (CCASS). The exchange said the overall response rate was 64 percent and viewed that as adequate to validate the results.  </p>
<p>The survey covered a wide range of topics, market regulation, the performance of the exchange and its member brokers, trading systems and practices, information dissemination, clearing and settlement and the stock options market.</p>
<p>More than half the respondents to the survey said the exchange was an effective regulator of the secondary market.</p>
<p>In general, broker members rated their business conduct and services more highly than fund managers and CCASS participants rated them.</p>
<p>Respondents were somewhat dissatisfied with the adequacy and timeliness of the disclosure of issuers' information and even more dissatisfied with the accessibility to investors of price-sensitive information disclosed by issuers, the survey said.</p>
<p>While most respondents agreed that regulated short selling was beneficial to the Hong Kong stock market, only about six percent of respondents had ever participated in regulated short selling. Only 21 percent of respondents had experience in the Hong Kong stock options market, the survey said.  </p>
<p>All types of respondents were highly positive on the listing and trading of China securities on the Hong Kong exchange and strongly supported the listing of a broader range of China securities.</p>
<p>However, the overall response on the adequacy of information disclosed by issuers of H-shares, a category reserved for China incorporated companies, was highly negative, the survey said.</p>
