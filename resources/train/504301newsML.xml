<p>The Chinese government has no plan to raise electricity prices sharply in the foreseeable future, the Xinhua news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>It quoted Shi Dazhen, minister of the Power Industry, as playing down the prospect of sharply higher power rates, although he did not rule out any price increases.</p>
<p>Shi made the statement in response to speculation of price rises following the recent creation of the China National Electricity Corp, a ministry company, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>The formation of the company has been widely seen as a way to make the power sector operate more on market principles.</p>
<p>&quot;The move in the long run can help keep electricity prices stable and even lower them,&quot; Xinghua quoted Shi as saying.</p>
<p>He said the main aim of the company was to support the giant Three Gorges dam project and aid the linking of China's regional power grids, according to Xinhua.</p>
<p>Electricty price adjustments in China are under strict state control.</p>
<p>Xinhua quoted Shi as saying that while electricity prices had doubled in the past two decades, the increase was far less than the rise in the overall price index over the same period.  </p>
<p>A series of measures to be taken by the ministry can also be considered &quot;positive factors&quot; to stabilise prices in future, Xinhua quoted Shi as saying. It did not elaborate.</p>
