<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenian shares ease, waiting for foreigners.</title>
<headline>Slovenian shares ease, waiting for foreigners.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Slovenian shares eased 1.32 percent on Monday and traders said prices were likely to continue tracking lower until the preconditions for a return of foreigners to the fledging market were in place.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in a waiting period and there will be no major moves until banks announce how much money from abroad they will be able to handle over the new custodian accounts,&quot; said Goran Spasenic, a trader at brokerage BPH.</p>
<p>The Bank of Slovenia three weeks ago said international investors had to open a custody account at one of Slovenia's 14 fully licensed banks if they wanted to trade in Slovenian securities. Banks said details of the new accounts should be ready by the end of this week.</p>
<p>&quot;If banks say that they will be able to handle at least one million marks per day, shares would rise immediatelly, because that's a lot of money for our market,&quot; Spasenic said. &quot;But if the amount is smaller, shares may fall.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that such a reaction was unlikely to break the overall positive long-term trend because international investors who already had bought into Slovenian shares were unlikely to sell their holdings any time soon.</p>
<p>The blue-chip SBI index fell 18.84 points to 1,412.21. Overall two shares rose, nine fell, two were unchanged and 13 were untraded.</p>
<p>Issue A of drug maker Lek had the highest turnover, falling 2.39 percent to 27,400 tolars on volume of 1,053 shares.</p>
<p>Financial consultancy Primofin was the top gainer, rising 10 percent to 13,200 on volume of 18 shares.</p>
<p>Ordinary shares of trader Kovinotehna led the decliners, down 5.33 percent to 515 tolars on volume of 1,451 shares. -- Marja Novak, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
