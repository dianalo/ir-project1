<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's new Prime Minister Tony Blair will appoint only members of his Labour Party to his new cabinet, a senior aide to his new government said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no members of other parties in the list,&quot; the aide said.</p>
<p>There had been speculation that Blair might invite a member of the minority Liberal Democrats to join his governing team following comments he made about the need for more plural politics in Britain.</p>
<p>The Liberals scored a minor triumph in the election, increasing their seats in parliament to a post-war record of 45, but this was overshadowed by the massive electoral landslide which gave Labour 419 seats.</p>
