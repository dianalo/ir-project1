<p>Poland's National Investment Funds (NFIs) which start bourse trade on Thursday are in for a bumpy ride with initial low liquidity expected to make their shares prone to sharp swings, analysts said.</p>
<p>Analysts said trade should gradually become smoother within the first two months from their debut as liquidity would improve with more and more holders of mass privatisation NFI units exchanging them for the funds' shares.</p>
<p>Since May 12 holders of 26 million NFI units, each entitling to one share in each of 15 funds, which control more than 500 firms, have been free to convert them into shares.</p>
<p>Two million units have been exchanged so far but analysts said at least six million were necessary for a liquid trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will be very volatile in the beginning... liquidity is likely to be low so price movements might be very sharp,&quot; said Marcin Billewicz of ING Barings.</p>
<p>Analysts said initially the combined price of all NFIs should exceed the price of NFI units which closed on Wednesday at 146.5 zlotys, as investor appetite might not be fully met.</p>
<p>They said many investors might prefer to zero in on particular funds rather than buy units representing all 15 funds, bidding up prices of fund shares.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the value of shares in all 15 funds should be significantly higher than current value of one unit,&quot; said Jacek Koczwara, an analyst at BGZ brokerage.</p>
<p>Analysts said however a wide price spread would trigger arbitrage between fund shares and units, eventually making valuations of both instruments converge. At the same time prices of particular funds were likely to start varying largely and Koczwara said differences might reach 40 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said that because of the funds' complex structure investors might find conventional measures of price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios of little help and look for other clues such as the industry breakdown of the fund's portfolio.</p>
<p>But they said new instruments should lure new players such as foreign close-ended funds.</p>
<p>&quot;Those NFIs are managed by experienced management companies...and I think that would be seen as a positive,&quot; said Geoffrey Skipper, chief strategist at Korona mutual fund company.</p>
<p>Analysts said the funds, by adding about 4.7 billion zlotys to the current 30-billion-zloty capitalisation, should also help lift the bourse's profile making and make it more attractive for big institutional players.</p>
<p>Korona decided to tap the funds' potential by offering clients a new fund investing solely in NFI units, fund shares and shares of companies encompassed by the scheme.</p>
<p>But some analysts said foreigners might stay sidelined waiting for the funds to prove themselves in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think initially those foreign investors who hold the vouchers...unless they are particularly aggressive, they will be watching and waiting for the dust to settle,&quot; said Stephen Pettyfer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London.</p>
<p>But in the longer-term the funds offered a good opportunity to gain exposure to Poland's growing economy, he added.</p>
