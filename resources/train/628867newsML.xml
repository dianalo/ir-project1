<p>The Pakistani government and the International Labour Organisation launched a programme on Saturday to end child labour in Pakistan's soccer ball industry within two years, an ILO official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are launching today a project to eliminate child labour in the soccer ball industry in Sialkot,&quot; Gert Gust, head of the ILO's global programme on child labour, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have set ourselves a very ambitious goal to eliminate child labour over the next two years,&quot; he said of the $1.5 million project for the city of Sialkot in Punjab province.</p>
<p>Sialkot, the centre of Pakistan's sports goods industry, produces two-thirds of the world's hand-stitched soccer balls for an export market worth $1 billion a year in retail sales, the ILO said.</p>
<p>At least 7,000 children are employed in Sialkot and adjoining villages. They are part of an army of 3.6 million children, some as young as four, who toil in workplaces across Pakistan, earning as little as 10 rupees ($0.24) a day.</p>
<p>&quot;I am heartened with discussions I had with the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce, our major partner, to work closely together with us, to monitor child labour, to withdraw children from child labour conditions,&quot; Gust said.</p>
<p>He said the project aimed to find measures to ensure that children excluded from the soccer ball industry would get access to education and reintegration in society.</p>
<p>The ILO has signed an agreement with leading sports goods manufacturers such as Adidas AG, NIKE Inc and Reebok International Ltd and industrialists in Pakistan to eradicate child labour from the industry.</p>
<p>An ILO official said 22 major soccer ball manufacturers, producing about 80 percent of the balls exported from Pakistan, had agreed to participate in the project.</p>
<p>Under the programme, the manufacturers are to set up stitching units which would not employ workers aged under 14.</p>
<p>At present, most stitching is outsourced to sub-contractors who take raw materials to village households where it is hard to monitor whether children are helping to make the soccer balls.</p>
<p>The official said several stitching centres had sprung up in Sialkot following the ILO initiative and more were being built.</p>
<p>Pakistan exported about 20 million balls, worth 1.265 billion rupees ($31 million) in 1995/96 (July-June), the ILO said, adding that demand was expected to increase.</p>
<p>Gust said another $2.2 million project was being launched in cooperation with the Pakistani government and the European Union to prevent abusive child labour. It calls for 18 centres to be set up across Pakistan to rehabilitate child workers.</p>
<p>Pakistan ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child that prohibits child labour in 1990, but legal experts say legislation needs to be enacted to implement it.</p>
