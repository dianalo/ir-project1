<p>The U.N. refugee agency said on Friday it had urged Italy and Greece to allow Albanians fleeing violence and anarchy to enter and stay as long as necessary, because sending them back home could expose them to danger.</p>
<p>The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was helping both countries to prepare for a possible influx, although no mass movement has been detected, spokesman Kris Janowski said.</p>
<p>At least 500 Albanians fleeing unrest have arrived in Italy in recent days, spokeswoman Maki Shinohara told Reuters. They were taken to Bari-Palese, north of Brindisi, where shelters can hold up to 1,000.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia, expressing alarm at the &quot;deep destabilisation&quot; of its neighbour, closed its border on Thursday. Ethnic Albanians account for almost one-fifth of the 10-million population of Serbia, which together with Montenegro comprises postwar Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Shinohara said that while UNHCR understood the concern of authorities in Kosovo, Serbia's tiny ethnic Albanian province, if significant numbers of Albanians were stranded at the border, the agency would urge Kosovo to be more lenient.</p>
<p>Albania's revolt, which began in the south where people have lost their savings in bogus investment schemes, has spread to the north in recent days. Law and order has broken down in Tirana after civilians looted arms depots and food warehouses.</p>
<p>Earlier, UNHCR spokesman Janowski said that only a &quot;limited number&quot; of Albanians, which he estimated to be in the hundreds, had fled over the border in their own vehicles or hired boats.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment only a limited number of individuals have left Albania. Some fled targeted violence and apparently others fled the general conflict situation,&quot; Janowski told a briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, we are in close contact with the governments of Italy and Greece and are discussing arrangements for a possible influx of people.</p>
<p>&quot;We are requesting neighbouring countries to allow those leaving Albania to enter their territory and to allow them to remain there as long as necessary under the current circumstances,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>UNHCR envoys were helping the Italian and Greek governments to set up camps for Albanians, according to Shinohara.</p>
<p>Italy has identified a shelter site near a former military airport at Bari-Palese, which can hold up to 1,000, while Greece was planning facilities for 3,000 in the north, she added.</p>
<p>The developing exodus raised fears in Italy of a repeat of the tide of 40,000 Albanians who flooded in on rusting freighters in 1991 after more than four decades of rigid Stalinist rule crumbled in Europe's poorest state.</p>
<p>Janowski, asked whether UNHCR had been given assurances that Italy would not turn back Albanians fleeing violence, replied: &quot;I don't think we have any specific asssurances from the Italian government for the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't take a lot of thinking to figure out that the situation in Albania is very, very confused and very volatile.</p>
<p>&quot;It is, at least judging from reports from the ground and media, getting worse. Under those circumstances, sending people back would be exposing them to possible dangers.&quot;</p>
