<p>A statement from Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH said the company was dismayed by Moldova's decision to review its tobacco industry privatisation tender and to keep Reemtsma, the initial winner, uninformed.</p>
<p>It also said Moldova itself had undermined the basis of the tender arrangements and blocked new negotiations.</p>
<p>The statement, issued in both German and English, said, &quot;These reports (about the cancellation) have met with astonishment in the (Reemtsma) group headquarters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no information in Hamburg about a cancellation of the tender which Reemtsma won in the spring of 1996, nor has Reemtsma at any time set conditions towards the Moldova side which would run contrary to the tender.&quot;</p>
<p>Moldova's Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc said on February 7 the tender results were cancelled in a move giving competing bidder Britain's B.A.T. Industries plc a new chance to win the deal.</p>
<p>This followed the formation of a new government in Moldova after elections in December and parliamentary criticism of the tender decision made last May.</p>
<p>Reemtsma, which is controlled by Tchibo Holding AG, said media in Moldova had alleged Reemtsma made additional demands, but the Reemtsma offer available in Hamburg and Moldova's capital Chisinau was strictly in line with the tender.</p>
<p>Moldova had held up the establishment of a joint venture between its tobacco producers and Reemtsma.</p>
<p>&quot;It emerged that...Moldova...was not in a position to meet elementary obligations on which the tender was based,&quot; Reemtsma said.</p>
<p>It added assets formerly subject to the tender had been sold off and the industry's financial situation had turned out to be worse than described in the tender documents.</p>
<p>Reemtsma said Moldova already sabotaged a 1994 agreement with Reemtsma.</p>
<p>Moldova in 1996 harvested 19,000 tonnes of tobacco leaves. Its industry is valued by international auditors Arthur Andersen at $35-65 million.</p>
