<p>Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said on Thursday he may ask Baghdad for help against the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) militia.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Kurdish people are under hard pressure of the PUK, we will ask for help from Iraq,&quot; Barzani told a news conference at his residence near the northern town of Salahuddin.</p>
<p>He repeated accusations that Iran had helped his rival take back much of northern Iraq from his forces this week.</p>
<p>&quot;If Iran has the right to support the PUK, why shouldn't we have the right to demand support from Iraq?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There were no signs on Thursday of an Iraqi military presence around Salahuddin.</p>
<p>Iraqi tanks and troops helped Barzani take the key city of Arbil from the PUK in August, prompting U.S. missile attacks on military targets in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>PUK forces have closed in on Arbil in recent days.</p>
<p>Barzani said he was not willing to hold direct talks with PUK leader Jalal Talabani, despite U.S. mediation attempts.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said when asked if he would sit at the negotiating table with his longtime rival. &quot;If they want, the U.S. can play a role in the region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials from the two warring parties were to meet U.S. officials in Washington later on Thursday. The United States fears any increase in Iranian or Iraqi influence in northern Iraq.</p>
