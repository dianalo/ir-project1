<p>Italian bond futures held at firmer level after touching new record highs in early trading helped by the strength of other European debt markets while support also came from a stronger lira and dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>The March LIFFE futures contract scored a new record high of 131.75 in morning trading before edging off the highs to last trade up 17 basis points at 131.49 at around 1600 GMT.</p>
<p>Dealers say attention today will focus on the first two Italian cities of Turin and Trieste to report January CPI data later this afternoon at around 1630 GMT ahead of a further nine cities on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Preliminary CPI from 11 sample Italian cities is due today and Tuesday and analysts forecast a month-on-month rise of 0.2 percent and a year-on-year rate of 2.6 percent in January, after 0.1 percent and 2.6 percent rises in December.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading had been moderate with the market reacting to the firmer dollar and a lira touching 31-month highs against the mark, but with the U.S. Treasury market closed today for Martin Luther King day trading activity was subdued.</p>
<p>The BTP market is still largely overbought at the moment and vulnerable to profit taking, but investors see little reason for a big sell-off at the moment, dealers added.  </p>
<p>Many investors said that the Bank of Italy is not expected to shift official interest rates until a solution is found to the long-running debate between employers and metalworker and engineering unions over renewing contracts.</p>
