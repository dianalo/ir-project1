<title>GERMANY: German call money rates steady after repo drain.</title>
<headline>German call money rates steady after repo drain.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-10-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>German call money rates rose briefly to 3.10 percent on Wednesday after a surprise net drain of 2.4 billion marks at the weekly repo allocation, but the rates soon eased back to Tuesday's level of 3.00/3.05 percent.</p>
<p>Money dealers said the Bundesbank probably had indications that the money market would experience some net inflows in the coming days.</p>
<p>Most banks had expected the Bundesbank to replace the expiring repo pact of 67.5 billion marks with an equal amount of repo funds today. In fact, it provided only 65.1 billion marks in 14-day funds at three percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;After call money was firmer initially, we're now back at an unchanged level of 3.00 to 3.05 percent&quot;, one dealer said.</p>
<p>Commercial banks' reserves at the Bundesbank -- a measure of market liquidity -- were not high enough to justify a net drain, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps the Bundesbank saw the bad weather and thought people will spend their autumn vacation at home rather than go out and withdraw money,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Another dealer predicted that the money market would see a net inflow in the coming days, resulting partly from government tax revenues.  </p>
<p>Besides, banks had another two repo tenders this month with which to replenish their reserves ahead of the end-month deadline, dealers said.</p>
<p>Commercial banks' effective deposits totalled 40.2 billion marks on Tuesday, up from Monday's 39.3 billion marks.</p>
<p>The average for the month through Tuesday rose to 38.0 billion marks from 37.9 billion. Lombard borrowings were negligible on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average  FIONA= was 3.05933 percent on Wednesday, up fractionally from Tuesday's 3.05833 percent. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525</p>
