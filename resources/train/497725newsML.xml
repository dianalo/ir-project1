<p>Pope John Paul will lead Sunday mass at Lebanon's largest reconstruction site in the war-shattered heart of Beirut on May 11, papal nuncio Pablo Puente said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pope will celebrate the Sunday Mass in the city centre, on an esplanade near the sea and behind the Martyrs Square,&quot; Puente told reporters at a news conference.</p>
<p>During his long-awaited two-day visit to the country starting on May 10, the Pope will meet Lebanon's youth and sign in their presence a document prepared after a synod of the Lebanese Church held at the Vatican in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The post-synodal cermony is different this time. The Pope usually conducts it in private. The intention this time is to manifest that the synod is for everyone and in particular for the young people,&quot; Puente said.</p>
<p>The Pope will hold talks with top Moslem and Christian spiritual leaders. The details of these meetings would be announced later, Puente said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pope is convinced that the Lebanese will succeed to actuate in unity a true reconciliation which will be the best guarantee for the future of Lebanon,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pope will make the trip from Beirut airport to Baabda in his panoramic jeep &quot;Papamobile&quot; which will allow him to salute and bless the population,&quot; Puente said. He would meet Lebanon's top officials at Baabda palace, east of Beirut.</p>
<p>The Vatican indefinitely postponed a five-day papal visit to Lebanon scheduled for May 1994 after the bombing of a Maronite church north of Beirut three months earlier that killed 11 Sunday worshippers and injured 59.</p>
<p>Puente said the Pope would consecrate a chapel built ahead of his 1994 planned visit at the nunciature in Harissa, 20 km (12 miles) northeast of Beirut.</p>
