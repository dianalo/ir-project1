<p>British Finance Minister Kenneth Clarke on Friday predicted a rosy future for Hong Kong as a finance centre but said London would keep a watch on rights and freedoms after communist China takes control on July 1.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Beijing dismissed London's concerns about democracy and said British protests would not jolt the sovereignty transition.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China at midnight on June 30 under a 1984 treaty known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p>
<p>The treaty commits China to allowing Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and to keeping the territory's capitalist system intact for 50 years.</p>
<p>Clarke, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, told a financial conference that Hong Kong's transparent rule of law and sensible economic policies, as practised under British rule, should be extended beyond the handover.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong's continued success must be built upon the continuation of sensible economic and financial policies, supported by a clear and transparent system of law and administration that has ensured success under British rule and which lie at the heart of the Joint Declaration,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also said in a radio interview that he was upbeat about Hong Kong's future.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm reasonably optimistic, but obviously everything depends...on the continuation of the financial framework that's always existed here that enabled Hong Kong to be such a fantastic success,&quot; Clarke said.</p>
<p>Clarke said he would push for Hong Kong to be the Asian hub of the International Monetary Fund, which staged Friday's conference together with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in what is widely seen as a rehearsal for this year's full-blown annual IMF/World Bank meeting in the territory.</p>
<p>&quot;We would prefer that the regional office be in Hong Kong,&quot; Clarke told Hong Kong radio. &quot;I will continue to press (IMF managing director) Michel Camdessus...to choose Hong Kong for the regional office.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke said countries in the IMF wanted Hong Kong to stay financially important. &quot;I think it's one of the most important issues facing the countries that comprise the IMF to ensure that Hong Kong does remain a financial centre after the changeover.&quot;</p>
<p>Camdessus said in a newspaper interview that Hong Kong was shortlisted as the possible spot for the IMF's new Asian office.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Foreign Minister Qian said British opposition to China's plans to disband Hong Kong's elected legislature was unreasonable but would not ruffle the smooth transfer of power.</p>
<p>&quot;The British side's opposition to this is an overreaction and unreasonable and unnecessary... If they continue to voice their opposition to the operation of the provisional Legislative Council, I don't think it will have any impact on the smooth transition of Hong Kong,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China has said it will scrap Hong Kong's elected Legislative Council, install an appointed provisional body and reverse democratic reforms. The moves are opposed by locally elected pro-democracy lawmakers and Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Sino-British tensions over Hong Kong were underlined by a report in the official China Daily that said the new legislature set up by Beijing would amend five percent of the colony's laws.</p>
<p>Clarke also told the conference that, &quot;As a signatory of the Joint Declaration, we will continue to take a close interest in ensuring that Hong Kong's economic achievements, and the rights and freedoms which underpin them, are fully preserved.&quot;</p>
