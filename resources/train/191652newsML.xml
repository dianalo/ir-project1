<headline>PremiumWear Q3 includes gain on sale.</headline>
<dateline>MINNEAPOLIS 1996-11-14</dateline>

<p>PremiumWear Inc said its October 5 third quarter earnings of $4.0 million, or $1.86 per share, included an after-tax gain of $4.1 million, or $1.89 per share, on the sale of trademarks and trade names.</p>
<p>&quot;Without that gain, we would have had a small loss in the quarter, primarily due to retail and golf related inventory sold at no margin as a result of our exit from those businesses,&quot; said chairman Thomas Gleason in a statement.  </p>
<p>Gleason said that, in the third quarter, the apparel company's Premium/Special Markets business had already surpassed 1995 total sales and he expects Premium/Special Markets business sales volume for the full year of 1996 to be about 70 percent above last year's $15.4 million.</p>
<p>Gleason also noted: &quot;The company had $15.6 million in cash at the end of the quarter and still had some retail and golf related accounts receivable to collect, inventories to liquidate and liabilities to pay. As reported in our August proxy statement, we expect to distribute to shareholders at least $12 million in the first quarter of 1997.&quot;</p>
