<p>French bond futures traded in a narrow range on Monday, taking their direction from firmer U.S. and German bond markets, and survived a late test of a key support level at 130.98.</p>
<p>Traders said the contract would probably continue to take a breather after last week's marked declines with little major events on the agenda.</p>
<p>The short end of the curve, however, continued to suffer with June PIBOR losing four basis points and the contracts further out underperforming.  </p>
<p>Traders said a general feeling the front of the curve was not pricing in enough risk of an economic upturn in Europe, despite the view rates would be on hold for some time, weighed on PIBOR contracts, with the Dutch rate hike also denting sentiment.</p>
<p>The franc was stable at 3.3732 per mark compared with 3.3733 late on Friday but off last week's low of 3.3689. Against the dollar the franc gained ground, climbing to 5.7445 from 5.7845 at the end of last week.</p>
<p>Analysts said the French February household confidence survey due Tuesday at 0745 GMT would be of minor interest.  </p>
<p>After recent signs of some improvement in the French economy, albeit with unemployment at record highs, they said it would be interesting to see whether the rise in confidence from low levels in January was sustained the following month.</p>
<p>Also of interest on Tuesday will be the announcement of the size of Thursday's government bond auction in Ecu given the stiff funding programme facing the Treasury ahead of large redemptions later in the year.</p>
