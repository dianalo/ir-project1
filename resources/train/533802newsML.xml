<p>Singapore gas oil swaps edged down in quiet trade in line with weaker overnight crude values as market fundamentals remain unchanged, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is down because of crude, there's not much going on,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>May gas oil swaps were last quoted at $25.50/$25.70 per barrel, down from Tuesday's $25.80/$25.90.</p>
<p>June gas oil also fell to $24.30/$24.40 per barrel, down from $24.45/$24.55. June traded earlier in the day at $24.32.  </p>
<p>Overnight June Brent crude closed down 35 cents to $17.99 per barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange but rebounded slightly on SIMEX to last trade at $18.13.</p>
<p>Traders said the market is still well supported by two Singapore traders who have bought close to 15 million barrels of physical gas oil since early March.</p>
<p>The traders on Tuesday bought four 150,000-barrel cargoes at between $26.60 to $27.50 for early to second half May loading.  </p>
<p>Others said the market was also looking to large purchases from India for June arrival diesel for support. India on Wednesday issued a tender to buy 0.25 percent and 1.0 percent diesel.</p>
<p>India bought an unexpectedly large 870,000 tonnes of diesel for May delivery which helped absorb some of the more than 1.6 million tonnes of arbitrage cargoes that were shipped to this region from the West.</p>
<p>The fuel oil swaps also fell slightly with the lower crude values with May last quoted at $97.50/$98.75 per tonne, from $98.00/$98.50 on Tuesday.  </p>
