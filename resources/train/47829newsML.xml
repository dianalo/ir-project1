<p>Express freight giant Federal Express Corporation has begun its first dedicated freighter service from Hong Kong to its Asian hub at Subic Bay in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Airbus A310 in the early hours of Tuesday (Sep 10) was a low key event but Fedex officials said it marked an important milestone in the development of its U.S.$60 million Asian network centre which opened 12 months ago at the former U.S. naval base.</p>
<p>North of the capital Manila, the hub, which is in the Subic Bay Freeport Economic Zone, has attracted substantial foreign investment, officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>The start of the Hong Kong connection comes a week after twice-weekly flights began from Beijing and Shanghai, bringing the number of overnight destinations served by the Fedex intra-Asian network to 13, a Fedex spokesperson said. The cities served include Seoul, Taipei, Singapore and Penang.</p>
<p>Five converted passenger Airbus A310 aircraft with 82,000 pounds cargo capacity are based at the Subic hub which comes alive between 10pm and 4am five nights a week.</p>
<p>Fedex, which claims to be the world's largest express transportation company, said the new links give shippers an unrivalled service within Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;We had our first flight from Beijing and Shanghai last week and now Hong Kong which means we can offer a whole new service for our customers,&quot; said John Allison, Vice President, South Pacific region speaking to Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Shippers in Shanghai, Beijing or Hong Kong, have very fast overnight conections throughout Asia. Previously we were limited in what we could do. Now we can shift any type of cargo anywhere throughout our Asian network,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We can pick up or deliver to 60 cities in China and the potential for this market is massive. It gives shippers great flexibility which they have not had up until now and at a competitive price,&quot; he added.</p>
