<p>Suspected rebels have attacked a small town in northern Sierra Leone, killing 36 people including six hospital patients, military officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Two Filipino doctors operating two patients in Massanga Hospital had to abandon the surgery. They managed to flee with the patients and some hospital workers in two vans as the rebel attack began on Friday, the military said.</p>
<p>An undisclosed number of hospital workers and patients were abducted by the rebels, who looted the medical store and dispensary, they said.</p>
<p>All the other killings were in Massanga itself or surrounding villages.</p>
<p>Military authorities described the attack on Massanga as the bloodiest since a ceasefire agreed between Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and the government last March effectively collapsed in the last couple of months.</p>
<p>Much of the recent fighting has been confused, with civilian residents saying they are unable to tell whether indisciplined soldiers or rebels are responsible for attacks on remote towns and villages.</p>
<p>The army said it repelled a RUF attack on Sunday on northern Bumbuna where the governmet is building a hydro-electric dam.</p>
<p>Last May RUF and the government broke off negotiations in Ivory Coast on ending the five-year-old civil war that has devastated Sierra Leone's mining economy.</p>
<p>Ivorian mediators have been unable to recovene the talks, which were suspended after the two sides failed to agree on one major point -- RUF's demand for the departure of South African mercenaries helping the Sierra Leone army.</p>
