<headline>FORECAST - UK money supply, consumer credit to ease.</headline>

<p>British M0 money supply and consumer credit data will show high street spending continued at healthy levels in August and September but somewhat more modestly than in recent months, analysts said.</p>
<p>M0 growth is forecast at 6.9 percent year-on-year in September, down from 7.5 in August. Consumer credit is expected to have risen by 870 million stg in August.</p>
<p>The month before, it shot up by 1.027 billion stg, the second highest monthly increase on record.</p>
<p>Both figures are due out at 0830 GMT on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent weekly data point towards a significant slowdown (in M0) in September,&quot; said Philip Shaw, Union Plc group economist.</p>
<p>&quot;If borne out, a sudden deceleration may challenge the notion that a runaway consumer boom has begun, thus helping to quiet market fears of a near-term tightening in monetary policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, a run of strong economic data have prompted most UK market watchers to stop weighing up the odds of one more rate cut and instead, to start wondering if an early policy tightening could become necessary.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, M0 growth of around seven percent remains way above the government's monitoring range of one-to-four percent and hardly demonstrates a sluggish economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying trend is buoyant with notes in circulation growth averaging 7.9 percent in September,&quot; said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>&quot;The weakness this month is mainly due to an expected decline in bankers' operational deposits,&quot; Barr said.</p>
<p>Shaw noted a fall in M0 would be at least partly due to hefty increases a year ago falling out of the equation.</p>
<p>The picture should be similar for consumer credit, economists said. While a rise of 870 million would be well below July's meteoric increase, it too does not suggest British consumers are retreating into their shells.</p>
<p>&quot;At least part of the recent acceleration in credit growth may reflect increased consumer confidence along with aggressive marketing campaigns by finance houses,&quot; Barr said.</p>
<p>Philip Uglow, Shaw's fellow economist at Union Plc, said a monthly increase in credit of 850 million stg, which he forecast, was large by historical standards.</p>
<p>&quot;The pick-up in credit growth seen since the start of the year is consistent with an upturn in consumer fortunes and looks set to continue for some time yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The best pointer for consumer credit figures comes from the British Bankers' Association data. Its latest figures, released last week, showed consumer credit lent by banks rose 453 million stg in August, down from a July rise of 556 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The BBA figures showed lending remained at buoyant levels, in August,&quot; Uglow said.</p>
