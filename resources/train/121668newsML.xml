<p>Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, is likely to take a more active role in the market to ensure a stable crown as the country remains outside Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Market reports that the Riksbank intervened on Monday to slow a strengthening of the crown against the mark in the wake of Finland's link to the ERM remain unconfirmed by the bank.</p>
<p>Currency market players said the bank intervened when the crown firmed to 4.29 to the mark. On Wednesday at 0930 GMT the crown was trading at 4.2960 to the mark.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said the Riksbank would, as the bank itself hinted last month, become more active in the market but it would not defend any set level.</p>
<p>&quot;They were in the market the other day because of the speed of the strengthening of the crown, not the level,&quot; said a trader at one of Sweden's big four banks.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the crown follows other European currencies against the mark I don't think they will be very aggressive in their intervention but they don't want any volatility.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said the Riksbank wanted to ensure the crown remained stable without an ERM link, and that its low inflation target would be adhered to.</p>
<p>A question mark remains over whether or not a country has to link its currency to the ERM for two years as a prerequisite to membership of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), due to come into force on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The Swedish government has argued that it is not required - but the head of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), Alexandre Lamfalussy, has said it is necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;There does not seem to be any facts on this and I do not see the crown moving out of the narrow range it is currently boxed into until we have word on this,&quot; said another trader who requested anonymity.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is closely following these discussions but nothing new seems to be up.&quot;</p>
<p>He expected the crown to remain in a 4.28-4.40 range until the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The market perceives that the Riksbank now has a level that it wants and has put a floor there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past week there has been diminishing overseas interest in the crown.&quot;</p>
<p>One economist told Reuters the rumoured intervention had not come as a surprise - although it was the first time the bank had moved to stop the crown strengthening too far.</p>
<p>Riksbank spokesman Michael Wallin last month said the bank would increase buying and selling activity on the currency markets to stabilise the crown but this should not be seen in the context of possible preparation for ERM entry.</p>
<p>But the economist said the EMU remained the force driving the European currency markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The Swedish Riksbank wants to be in the ERM but for political reasons it is very difficult with polls showing the Swedish public is against EMU,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Swedish policy makers were also concerned that linking the crown to the ERM could conflict with Riksbank's target of one-two percent inflation a year for the next two years.</p>
<p>&quot;If the crown was pegged to the ERM now but Sweden did not join EMU from the start, this could put pressure on the crown,&quot; he said. &quot;If the central bank raised interest rates to defend the crown it could be in conflict with the inflation goal.&quot;</p>
