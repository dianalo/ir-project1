<p>Japanese institutional investors plan to scale back their stock investments and put more of their funds into bonds in the medium term, a Reuters investment survey for November showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The survey showed that domestic investors have basically not changed their investment stance from the previous survey on a view that both global stock and bond markets will remain stable in the month ahead.</p>
<p>One significant change is a growing view that the U.S. stock market has peaked. The key Dow Jones industrials have been hitting fresh record highs on an almost daily basis, and investors plan to scale back their equity investments in the medium term, the survey showed.</p>
<p>The Reuters monthly Global Asset Allocation survey asked 16 Japan-based financial institutions about their recommended investment strategy for November.</p>
<p>The average overall portfolio weighting of bonds rose to 37.83 percent, up 1.16 percentage point from the previous survey for October. Meanwhile the average overall weighting for equity investments fell one percentage point from the previous survey to 46.67 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Canadian bond markets remain popular investments, with many expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged in November.</p>
<p>The Japanese financial markets remain unpopular among domestic investors, with the average weighting of Japanese stocks falling to 29.97 percent from 32.13 percent, dropping below 30 percent for the first time in 15 months.</p>
<p>Foreign investors in Japan, such as U.S. mutual funds, are shifting their funds out of Japan and into other Asian and European markets, one investor said.</p>
