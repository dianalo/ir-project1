<p>RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. shareholders voting at the company's annual meeting Wednesday defeated a motion for an immediate spin-off of the company's Nabisco Holdings Corp. food business, RJR said.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco owns 80.5 percent of Nabisco Holdings' stock. The food and tobacco company had been under pressure from Wall Street investors Bennett LeBow and Carl Icahn to divest Nabisco immediately.</p>
<p>LeBow and Icahn claimed that RJR's ownership of R.J. Reynolds Tobbaco Co., and the tobacco litigation that firm has been facing, is reducing Nabisco's stock market value.</p>
<p>RJR said shareholders also defeated, &quot;by substantial margins,&quot; shareholder proposals regarding tobacco-related issues and employment reporting.</p>
<p>Of the 278.8 million shares eligible to vote at the meeting, more than 240.6 million were represented, or 86 percent of the outstanding shares, the company said.</p>
<p>It also said shareholders re-elected nine directors, ratified the appointment of Deloitte &amp; Touche as auditors and approved changes in the company's long-term incentive plan.</p>
<p>Nabisco's stock gained $1.125 to $39.625, while RJR was up $3.375 at $33.625, both in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after news that the tobacco giant was negotiating with with state attorneys general and plaintiffs lawyers on a settlement of tobacco litigation.</p>
