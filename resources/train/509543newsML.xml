<title>USA: Guidant, Medtronic up on AVID study halt.</title>
<headline>Guidant, Medtronic up on AVID study halt.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Guidant Corp and Medtronic Inc jumped early Tuesday on expectations that the market for implantable defibrillators, which both companies make, will widen as the result of a landmark study halted Monday by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>&quot;The test results again fit into our thesis that what we'll see over the next few years is a number of studies showing the superiority of implantable defibrillators over anti-arrhythmic drugs...This is the second study to widen that patient population,&quot; said J.P. Morgan Securities medical technology analyst Michael Weinstein.  </p>
<p>Shares in Indianapolis-based Guidant were up 3-1/8 to 62-5/8, while shares in Minneapolis-based Medtronic were up 2-1/2 to 63-3/4.</p>
<p>In a statement issued late Monday, Medtronic said it expects &quot;results of the AVID (Antiarrythmics vs. Implantable Defibrillators) study to accelerate medical market acceptance of implantable defibrillators as the therapy of choice for persons afflicted with lethally rapid heartbeats.&quot;</p>
<p>A company spokesman said Medtronic was unable to quantify how much the study might expand the market for implantable defibrillators, estimated today at about $700 million.  </p>
<p>On Monday, the NIH said it stopped the AVID trial due to &quot;a significant reduction in deaths in the group of patients whose arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) was treated with a defibrillator.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This landmark study is the first large controlled study to show that implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) improve overall survival in patients with serious ventricular arrhythmias,&quot; said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the NIH's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've known for some time that these devices stop arrythmias and restore normal heart rhythm -- but it has not been known, until now -- whether they improve overall survival,&quot; Dr. Lenfant said.</p>
<p>The study, begun in 1993, looked at 1,016 patients suffering from disorders in which the heart beats too rapidly.</p>
<p>Some received drugs to treat their conditions, while others were implanted with ICDs, small electronic devices installed in the body and wired to the heart to keep it from beating too fast. The ICD group showed markedly superior treatment and the trial was halted prematurely, the NIH said.</p>
<p>The fast-growing world market for ICDs is dominated by Guidant and Medtronic, with a smaller market share being held by Ventritex Inc, which is being acquired by St. Jude Medical Inc.</p>
<p>Up to now, ICDs have usually been prescribed for patients who have already suffered heart problems. Analysts speculated that the AVID study, as well as results from last year's similar MADIT study, will open the market for ICDs as a preventive therapy.</p>
