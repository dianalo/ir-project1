<title>EGYPT: Nile Cotton corners Egypt bourse turnover.</title>
<headline>Nile Cotton corners Egypt bourse turnover.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1997-07-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Share prices barely flinched but turnover on Thursday was the highest this week on the Cairo bourse with wedges of Nile Cotton Ginning shares changing hands.</p>
<p>The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) share index flickered up just 0.07 points to close at 349.85. Above average turnover of 85.30 million pounds ($25.13 million) was the highest in the trading week. The index has hovered in the same range all month.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very thin market. It's over-sold - in the exhaustion phase,&quot; said Shireen AlKady, vice chairman and chief investment officer of Prime Investments.</p>
<p>Nile Cotton Ginning had the highest turnover with 10.69 million pounds changing hands in just three moves. Its share price was unimpressed, slipping 0.10 to a 53.00 pound close.</p>
<p>&quot;There was bulk trade of about 200,000 shares. Maybe an employee stock association shift,&quot; said AlKady. &quot;It could be an execution of shares previously obtained during the IPO.&quot;</p>
<p>The Egyptian state sold 2.896 million shares, or more than 48 percent, of the firm in February. The CMA had said the sale raised 128.035 million pounds ($37.64 million), averaging about 44.21 pounds a share.</p>
<p>AlKady said banking shares were weighing the market down.</p>
<p>&quot;The leading pulling-down sector is the banking sector. It is over-provisioned, which is eating provisions from earnings,&quot; he said. &quot;Banking is at an expensive P/E compared to others.&quot;</p>
<p>In character with their performance on Wednesday, banks were mixed. Commercial International Bank (CIB) shares were most active with four million pounds in turnover. But they failed to muster, ending steady at 72.60 pounds.</p>
<p>AlKady said the CIB share was &quot;well-positioned&quot;. &quot;I am sure it will appreciate on a market rally,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Others are just depressed with the market, which lacks new movement, buying waves, and has skeletal disclosure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were in the exact same depressing phase this time last year but we do not expect a strong rally like last year, when there were active privatisations,&quot; Kady said. &quot;The market is missing fresh, decent IPOs.&quot;</p>
<p>Partially privatised Alexandria Flour Mills was the most active mill share. It closed down 2.01 at 82.98.</p>
<p>Upper Egypt Flour Mills shares reversed direction, shedding 1.25 to 76.25, below analyst Prime's recommendation this week that investors buy at up to 79 pounds ($23.27).</p>
<p>The busiest cement stock was Amriyah. It slipped on Wednesday but on Thursday found its feet 1.0 pound up at 84.</p>
<p>The index for openly traded firms rose to 475.21 from 474.21 points on Wednesday and that for the rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms fell to 259.8 points from 259.99.</p>
<p>Of the 96 shares traded, 37 rose, 38 fell while 21 ended unchanged, the CMA said.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.395 pounds</p>
