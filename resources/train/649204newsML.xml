<title>UK: Japanese cities most expensive for expats - survey.</title>
<headline>Japanese cities most expensive for expats - survey.</headline>

<p>Tokyo is still the world's most expensive city for expatriates to live in but a weaker yen means costs are falling for foreigners, according to a survey published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The most expensive European city, Oslo, is ranked behind second-placed Osaka and Kobe, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Worldwide Cost of Living survey said.</p>
<p>West European cities in general, with London being a notable exception, continue to become cheaper places in which to live, due to a stronger U.S. dollar and weaker local currencies.</p>
<p>London has risen strongly in the rankings, moving from 29th position a year ago to 14 in June, 1997. This is largely because of high interest rates and confidence in the pound sterling.</p>
<p>Other cities where costs for expatriates are on the rise are Dublin, up to 28 from 35, and Moscow, rising to fourth place from 10th a year ago.</p>
<p>The Swiss cities of Geneva and Zurich, traditionally the most expensive in Europe, have fallen in the rankings from fifth to 10th and from third to sixth, respectively.</p>
<p>Hong Kong (5), Singapore (9), Taipei (11) and Beijing (16), have all become more expensive, moving up in the rankings as European cities have slipped down.</p>
<p>East European cities remain among the 20 cheapest cities in which to live in the world. Surprisingly, perhaps, it costs about the same to live in Prague as in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>The cities are measured against the cost of living in New York, which this year is the 22nd most expensive place to live.</p>
<p>The top 10 placings in the EIU's survey are as follows, with last year's ranking in brackets: 1. Tokyo (1) 2. Osaka-Kobe (2) 3. Oslo (4) 4. Moscow (10) 5. Hong Kong (12) 6. Libreville (10)</p>
<p>   Paris (6)</p>
<p>   Zurich (3) 9. Singapore (16) 10. Geneva (5)</p>
