<p>FC Copenhagen start as clear favourites to win the Danish Cup Final on Thursday but underdogs Ikast, who have lost only once in their last 21 games, promise to push them all the way to victory.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had a fantastic season. We have not lost a match for a very long time and we are going into the cup final determined to play in our usual attacking style,&quot; said Ikast trainer Poul Hansen.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot ignore the fact that Copenhagen are clear favourites but the pressure is on them to win. We can promise an entertaining match,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have beaten three superleague teams in a row, including the favourites Brondby in the semifinals. We can play as we like with no pressure on us,&quot; Hansen said.</p>
<p>While Ikast top the first division and could be heading for promotion, Copenhagen have had a disappointing season so far apart from the cup and are languishing fourth from the bottom of the 12-team superleague.</p>
<p>&quot;Our highest priority is obviously to keep our position in the superleague but if we do win the cup we will be able to say we have had a satisfactory season,&quot; Copenhagen trainer Kim Brink said.</p>
<p>FC Copenhagen, formed in 1992 when KB Copenhagen and B1903 Copenhagen merged, have won the cup once since the merger, in 1995. Ikast lost to the old B1903 club in the 1986 final and also lost to Brondby in 1989.</p>
