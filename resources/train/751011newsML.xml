<p>--------------------------(July 23)----------------------------</p>
<p>*Stocks end off highs but with solid gains, Dow surge bolsters rate-focussed local traders. Volume 321.04 million, value A$967.70 million, 1,098 stocks traded, 292 steady, 514 up, 292 down.  </p>
<p>An interest rate focussed Australian share market ended stronger but off its highs on Wednesday with hopes for another rate cut rising after key local inflation data came in on market expectations.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index jumped 27.0 to 2,683.4 after touching an intraday high of 2,696 shortly after the release of the second quarter inflation data, while the September share price index futures contract was 53 points higher at 2,712, a 28.6 point premium to the underlying index.</p>
<p>Traders took a positive lead early from Wall Street's relentless run, saying rate pressures in the U.S. had eased.  </p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street had a big run last night with Greenspan's comments that the economy was in good shape and that there was no need for immediate action on interest rates,&quot; said Hartley Poynton broker, Robin Forbes, adding that the upbeat tone there had combined with local interest rate hopes to help the market head higher.</p>
<p>&quot;On the local scene we have followed that plus the very low inflation figures. If the wages figures out tomorrow are on the low side then everyone will be expecting another rate cut.&quot;</p>
<p>May quarter wages data is due at 0130 GMT on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The banking sector stormed ahead, highlighting the focus on interest rates. Commonwealth Bank led the way, touching a record high of A$17.00 early before easing to close 50 cents higher, buoyed by a broker reports that again raised the possibility of a capital return rather than a share buyback.</p>
<p>ANZ and Westpac Banking Corp also hit record highs before retreating to each close over two percent higher. ANZ peaked at A$10.39 before ending at A$10.36, while Westpac topped out at A$8.20 before closing at A$8.16.</p>
<p>Sector heavyweight National Bank climbed over one percent to end at A$19.50.  </p>
<p>Turnover lists were topped by miner MIM which saw over 17.2 million shares traded, the bulk of it in three lines totalling 13 million shares specialled through Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, all at a price of A$1.77 per share.</p>
<p>MIM shares closed three cents higher at A$1.77</p>
<p>Mirvac Property Trust finished a close second in turnover stakes with 16.2 million units traded, most of it in one line of 16 million units at A$1.38 each specialled through HSBC Capel. Mirvac Property units ended a cent higher at A$1.38.</p>
<p>Brokers said the trade in both stocks appeared to be normal institutional business.  </p>
<p>BHP ended just four cents higher at A$17.98 after touching an intraday high of A$18.35, Rio Tinto closed in the minus column, down 9.7 cents at A$21.12 after peaking at A$21.49, as did WMC, shedding 13.9 cents to close at A$7.65 after topping out at A$7.90.</p>
<p>&quot;Nickel and copper prices have really been soft over the last week or so and gold has just added to the (weak) sentiment,&quot; said Hartley Poynton's Forbes, a sentiment echoed by other market participants.</p>
<p>&quot;The miners didn't have as many reasons to run and that told in the end,&quot; said a dealer at a Sydney-based investment house.  </p>
<p>Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about nine to five, while about 27 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>Futures trade was heavy with 10,675 September share price index futures contracts traded, while a healthy 41,013 optiosn were traded.</p>
<p>In other local markets, Australia once again produced a stunningly low inflation performance in the June quarter, but for the bond market it came as little surprise and left it struggling to advance its strong rally since April.</p>
<p>By 5.25 p.m. (0725 GMT), 10 year T-bonds were yielding 6.52 percent, compared to Tuesday's 6.59 percent.  </p>
<p>The Australian dollar shuddered lower Wednesday as a record low inflation result brought a long threatened cut in official rates a step closer. By 5.25 p.m. (0725 GMT), the local dollar had lurched to US$0.7367/72 from an early US$0.7389/94 and US$0.7400/05 late here on Tuesday.</p>
