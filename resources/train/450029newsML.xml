<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks close higher despite S&amp;P downgrade.</title>
<headline>Thai stocks close higher despite S&amp;P downgrade.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-03-18</dateline>

<p>Thai stocks ended up on Tuesday as investors shrugged off Standard and Poor's downgrade of two major commerical banks and snapped up cheap blue-chip shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>After dipping around midday, the SET index ended up 6.95 points to 693.87 on 2.8 billion baht turnover. The SET-50 rose 0.78 points to 51.19.</p>
<p>&quot;The market appeared not to have much negative reaction on S&amp;P's downgrade of two commercial banks. Most share prices were already cheap after the recent fall,&quot; said one broker at Wall Street Finance.  </p>
<p>Brokers said an S&amp;P affirmation of Thailand's credit rating might also have helped boost investor confidence in the economy and the government's economic policies.</p>
<p>S&amp;P on Tuesday downgraded the credit ratings of Thai Farmers Bank and Siam Commercial Bank Plc to BBB-plus/A2 from A-minus/A2.</p>
<p>It also affirmed Thailand's single-A long term and A-1 short term foreign currency debt ratings, reflecting the government's substantial financial flexibility.  </p>
<p>&quot;S&amp;P's affirmation of the country's rating is quite good news. It reflects some degree of confidence in the government's newly-announced economic policies,&quot; said another broker at Ekkapat Finance.</p>
<p>Thai Farmers dropped one baht to close at 116 on the most active turnover of 327 million baht.</p>
<p>Siam Commercial ended unchanged at 132 and Krung Thai Bank gained 0.75 to 35.50.</p>
<p>General Finance, which denied reports that it planned to merge with a finance company, finished unchanged at 18.50 baht. -- Anuchit Nguyen (662) 652-0642</p>
