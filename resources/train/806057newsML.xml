<headline>OPTIONS - Dollar/mark vols firm in quiet trade.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-08-18</dateline>

<p>Implied volatilities for dollar/mark options remained well bid near Friday's closing levels in thin dealings as market participants paused to reassess dollar direction in light of last week's pullback.</p>
<p>Profit taking on long dollar positions pumped up  dollar/mark vols in a hurry over the past several sessions, and now many traders and investors are sidelined awaiting U.S. and German central bank meetings this week before stepping back into the fray, said an options dealer for a European bank.  </p>
<p>Many weak dollar longs have been shaken out, and a tendency to close positions at any hint of further weakness remains, the dealer said.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/mark volatility was 11.5/11.8 percent, about two-tenths higher than levels late Friday but up about three-quarters of a point from earlier in that day, traders said. Vols rose while the dollar swooned along with a 247-point dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  </p>
<p>In view of spot dollar/mark's healthy correction, to 1.827 marks currently from an August 6 peak of 1.8913, there continues to be good interest in buying low-delta &quot;wings&quot; comprising out of the money options, traders said.</p>
<p>The interest in such far-out strikes as 1.70 or 1.90 marks suggests more large moves are anticipated for the spot, the traders said.</p>
<p>Keen attention to U.S. asset prices began to subside through the morning as those markets found their footing, said a Wall Street-based forex options dealer.  </p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday to consider U.S. monetary policy, with the Bundesbank's interest rate meeting set for Thursday.</p>
<p>Although neither is expected to yield a change in interest rates, dollar-pair vols should continue to garner support while the meetings remain the main focus for the cash market.</p>
<p>&quot;The meetings will provide more pieces of the puzzle, but fairly small pieces,&quot; said the European bank trader.  </p>
<p>Risk reversals for dollar/mark continue to whip around amid heightened sensitivity to spot movements, traders said. The one-month 25-delta risk reversal in the early afternoon was pegged at flat/0.2, slightly in favor of mark calls.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen vols were also holding firm, up more than half a point at 12.4/12.7 percent in one-month options.</p>
<p>The dollar/yen risk reversal, or put/call pricing differential, was 0.2/0.4 skewed for yen puts.</p>
