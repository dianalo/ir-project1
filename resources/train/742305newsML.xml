<headline>DDI to continue in London bond broking business.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dawnay, Day International (DDI) said on Monday it plans to remain in the bond broking business after staff from a previously 50 percent owned joint venture decided to join DDI.</p>
<p>DDI said London-based Dawnay, Day Securities (DDS) was 50 percent owned by three of its directors and 50 percent by DDI, but that the three directors had earlier this year joined rival broker Cantor Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>DDI said that on Friday it was successful in its effort to have DDS put into administration through a British court so that the situation could be resolved.</p>
<p>DDI said Cantor bid for DDS and acquired the company from the administrators, but that all staff at the venture had resigned and joined DDI.</p>
<p>A DDI official told Reuters there were close to 50 staff who made the switch.</p>
<p>&quot;DDI intends, as soon as possible, to continue the interdealer bond broking business specialising in OATS, BTANs, Euro French francs and repos through an associated SFA regulated company Dawnay, Day Equities,&quot; DDI said in a statement.</p>
<p>A Cantor official in London referred all calls to the company's New York office. There was no one immediately available for comment at Cantor in New York.</p>
