<headline>FIA urges reforms at LME after UK metals review.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-11-13</dateline>

<p>The U.S. Futures Industry Association (FIA) said it has called for changes at the London Metal Exchange (LME) after a recent review of the metals market following the Sumitomo Corp copper scandal.</p>
<p>The FIA said in a statement that its suggestions, responding to a market review by Britain's Securities Investment Board (SIB), addressed segregation of client assets, margin financing and non-cash clearing.</p>
<p>It added that those issues were also an important part of a report by the FIA Global Task Force on Financial Integrity following the Barings Bank scandal of 1995.  </p>
<p>&quot;The board of FIA continues to put a high priority on the recommendations issued in the Task Force report to promote financial integrity worldwide,&quot; FIA president Johm Damgard said in the statement. &quot;We were pleased to be asked to share our views with the SIB and LME.&quot;</p>
<p>Sumitomo was said to have lost some $2.6 billion yen from illicit copper trades by former star trader Yasuo Hamanaka and Barings was seen to have racked up some $1.4 billion in unauthorized trades by Nick Leeson.</p>
<p>FIA said segregation of funds was vital in facilitating prompt transfer of client accounts in the event of a default.  </p>
<p>It added that if customers are allowed to &quot;opt out&quot; of segregation, appropriate disclosure should be given to allow them to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>FIA said it recommended that the extension of margin financing to clients be restricted to transactions where the financing is recognized as an independent loan, accompanied by formal credit approvals.</p>
<p>The association said it also recommended &quot;Historic Price Carries&quot;, which have been used to roll over losing positions, be eliminated.  </p>
<p>FIA said non-cash clearing should be eliminated because it would increase the possibility of &quot;pyramiding&quot; trades by clients, allowing positive variation margin (cash flow in margin account) to be used for other positions of the member firm.</p>
