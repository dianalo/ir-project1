<p>The stockmarket is betting on it and newspapers are convinced -- French conglomerates Lyonnaise des Eaux and Compagnie de Suez are about to announce a merger and working all-out to wrap it up, they say.</p>
<p>The two companies have resolutely refused to comment during well over a week of frenzied speculation, but an extended Easter holiday weekend away from the glare of media and markets would provide them with a perfect opportunity to arrange a wedding.</p>
<p>With the French bourse shut from Thursday evening to Tuesday morning, what better cover if they wanted to sort it all out without the steam building on their shares?</p>
<p>And both of them could well want it all wrapped up ahead of board meetings next week, as Suez prepares to announce its 1996 results on Wednesday, followed by Lyonnaise on Thursday.</p>
<p>A merger of the two  -- Lyonnaise, with its sprawling empire in water distribution, electricity and construction, and Suez, a conglomerate searching for an indentity after selling investment bank Indosuez -- makes sense, according to experts.</p>
<p>A tie-up would solve the identity crisis for cash-rich Suez and could provide Lyonnaise with the resources it needs to expand on a more equal footing with a giant rival in the same line of business, Generale des Eaux, they say.</p>
<p>Together the two would form a group ranking in France's top ten companies, still a touch behind Generale des Eaux, in terms of market capitalisation.</p>
<p>The question is no longer whether they will do it, but how and when, as far as stockbrokers and the media are concerned.</p>
<p>Business daily La Tribune, splashing the story on its front page on Friday, took a line recently touted in the stock market, namely that the smaller Lyonnaise would in fact absorb Suez.</p>
<p>The newspaper said sources in the two groups had confirmed that talks were in the final stages and the principal hurdles had been dealt with.</p>
<p>The most likely transaction was a share exchange of two Suez shares for each Lyonnaise share, plus a, possibly hefty, special dividend to sweeten the deal for Suez shareholders. A deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday, it added.</p>
<p>Lyonnaise and Suez declined all comment.</p>
<p>The firms affected by any deal through their shareholdings or involvement in the sector include a number of major players such as Generale des Eaux itself, which has an indirect stake in Suez through a 20 percent holding in Belgian Electrabel, in turn the biggest domestic rival to Lyonnaise in the Belgian market.</p>
<p>Despite reports of serious worries at Generale des Eaux, the group has denied it would try to block a Lyonnaise/Suez tie-up by launching a counter-bid for Suez.</p>
<p>Other Suez shareholders such as insurer Axa-UAP have declined to comment, while the cooperative banking giant Credit Agricole have refused to go further than the comment by chairman Lucien Douroux this week that &quot;we are following the current situation with interest&quot;.</p>
<p>He said his bank's 8.5 percent Suez stake was a &quot;strategic investment&quot;. It also has 3.3 percent of Lyonnaise.</p>
<p>But the ramifications are not purely of French stock market interest. Belgian Prime Minister went on record recently to say he was concerned that any merger should not demage the autonomy of Tractebel, owner of Electrabel.</p>
<p>In the complex matrix of crossed shareholdings, Suez owns 63 percent of Societe Generale de Belgique, which in turn controls Tractebel.</p>
<p>Suez, which has sold off assets like Indosuez and has been shoring up its accounts after heavy losses when the property market collapsed in the early 1990s, made a net attributable loss of 3.96 billion francs in 1995. Lyonnaise profit in the same year fell to 906 million from 1.06 billion francs.</p>
