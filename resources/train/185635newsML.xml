<p>IPE Brent crude ramped up in late trade led mainly by NYMEX products, brokers said.</p>
<p>December Brent gained more than a dollar as heating oil led a strong rally, quickly followed by NYMEX unleaded gasoline.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no real news out there but with the weather still cold in the U.S. and with the API's out tonight everyone is nervous of being short,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Another broker pointed to remarks made by Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva that Iraq hoped to &quot;clear the air&quot; with the United States now that President Clinton was re-elected.</p>
<p>The ambassador also said that President Saddam Hussein would not sit idly by and see Iraqi people suffer if he lost hope that Gulf War sanctions would be lifted.</p>
<p>&quot;It sounded aggressive and I think people are seeing Iraqi crude further away again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That's fighting talk,&quot; one wet Brent trader said.</p>
<p>As NYMEX heating oil broke up through stops brokers said good fund buying emerged bringing Brent December easily through resistance at $23.65 a barrel. In the last few minutes of trade the contract, which expires on Thursday, broke briefly up to resistance at $23.92.</p>
<p>December ended the day up $1.02 at $23.85 a barrel.</p>
<p>December gas oil closed earlier up $5.50 at $216.50 a tonne. The contract was called to open on Thursday three dollars firmer - bringing it above a technical gap between $216.50-218 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been a good strong close and all eyes will be on the API's tonight,' another broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the API's are not bullish we have a long way to fall,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Traders estimated that the weekly U.S. stock figures from the API will show a distillate build of 0.5-1 million barrels.</p>
