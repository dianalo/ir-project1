<title>FRANCE: French stocks close down on profit-taking.</title>
<headline>French stocks close down on profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-01-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>French stocks closed lower on Monday after the French market tracked an early decline on Wall Street due to profit-taking.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished down 19 points, or 0.78 percent, at 2,406.10 after giving up an early advance that lifted it an all-time intraday high of 2,438.50 points earlier.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 January futures contract fell 17 points to 2,412.</p>
<p>&quot;It's normal for the market to pause for breath,&quot; said a trader. The CAC index set four closing records last week.</p>
<p>Brokers said the bourse will probably trade cautiously ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony on Tuesday before the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>They said Merrill Lynch had concluded that the Paris bourse was correctly valued now after catching up with other stockmarkets, and this judgment had a dampening effect.</p>
<p>Monday's volume was a heavy 6.5 billion francs.</p>
<p>Shares in oil firm Elf Aquitaine rose 1.96 percent to 520 francs, helped by the dollar's gains and an upgrade on the stock by U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel shares closed up 5.8 percent at 7.30 francs after the Channel Tunnel operator reported a rise in passengers to 13 million in 1996 and said it hoped to finish negotiating details of a bank debt accord by March.</p>
<p>Shares in bank Credit Foncier slipped 0.16 percent to 63 francs. The chairman declared himself a hostage on Monday and broke off talks with unions as a staff siege at the troubled bank's headquarters dragged into a fourth day.</p>
