<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch money dealers clear books ahead of expiry.</title>
<headline>Dutch money dealers clear books ahead of expiry.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-06-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch money dealers, clearing their books ahead of the first cash reserve expiry on Friday under the Dutch central bank's new money market policy, said the market had enough liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;Call money rates remain stable at 2.75 percent bid and there seems to be enough liquidity around,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Market players are not allowed to show a debit balance on their cash reserve account at the central bank at the end of the trading day under the new system.</p>
<p>&quot;Liquidity in the market looks to be in balance although there might be an incidental liquidity gap,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The dealer said there was enough liquidity in the market to fill such a small gap, adding there was a greater chance that a few players had ample liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;Several participants have been saving under the scheme as they were not completely familiar with the central banks' new money market policy at the start,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Participants with a debit balance on their cash reserve account at the end of a trading day have to obtain overnight credit at the marginal advance facility rate of 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>Market players will not receive any return on their surplus.</p>
<p>There was little interest for the two new Dutch Treasury Certificate programmes (DTCs), short term borrowing programmes of the Dutch government, which went on sale today.</p>
<p>The new three-month DTCs, running until September 30, 1997, were priced at 3.09 percent and the 12-month programme, running until June 30, 1998, was priced at 3.21 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a good price,&quot; said one dealer, adding the Dutch government probably had enough liquidity in stock.</p>
<p>&quot;They might raise the price for the outstanding DTC programmes on Monday as they probably need liquidity to pay off the DTC programme that runs until June 30, 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The June 1997 programme had raised 7.5 billion guilders.</p>
<p>The guilder was slightly stronger versus the mark at 112.5275 per 100 marks compared to 112.555 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the special advances rate will most likely remain at 2.90 percent when the central bank sets a new pact this afternoon at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The allocation on the new pact tomorrow will probably be less ample than the previous one,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Individual banks received 28.8 percent of the amount they had applied for under this seven-day pact, with the central bank setting a ceiling of 4.07 billion guilders on applications.</p>
<p>&quot;The new pact will probably meet individual banks' applications up to 14 or 15 percent under the new pact,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>He said the current allocation had been sufficient because banks with a small liquidity gap could solve this with the central banks' allocation.</p>
