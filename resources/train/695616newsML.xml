<title>SIERRA LEONE: Rebels reinforce in Sierra Leone capital.</title>

<p>Rebel fighters who rallied to Sierra Leone's May 25 coupmakers have reinforced in and around the capital Freetown, saying that they are ready to fight to the death to defend it.</p>
<p>The rebels, some in their early teens, say around 2,000 reinforcements arrived over the weekend, taking the total number of rebels estimated in or around the city to over 6,000.</p>
<p>Residents in towns around the capital said on Monday that fighters of the Revolutionary United Front, which took up arms in 1991, were camped there.</p>
<p>&quot;We have come to reinforce our positions in and around Freetown in case we need to defend it against any attacks,&quot; one fighter, aged little more than 14, told reporters. &quot;We will fight to the last man if ordered to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>Sierra Leone's West African neighbours have closed their embassies in Freetown in line with a decision by their foreign ministers last week not to recognise the new ruling military junta, diplomats leaving the city said.</p>
<p>A meeting of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) foreign ministers on Thursday and Friday agreed to use dialogue, economic sanctions and, if necessary, force to reinstate civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.</p>
<p>Regional giant Nigeria closed its embassy the day after the May 25 coup. Gambia closed its embassy on Sunday.</p>
<p>Guinea's embassy remains open but the ambassador and other senior diplomats have left. Those left behind said they were there to provide travel documents for Guineans returning home.</p>
<p>Nigeria has troops in Sierra Leone under a defence pact. Its gunboats shelled Freetown on June 2 in a show of force.</p>
<p>Kabbah's 1996 election ended four years of army rule.</p>
