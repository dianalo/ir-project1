<headline>Brady gun law ruling sparks anger, relief.</headline>

<p>A Supreme Court ruling striking down part of the landmark Brady gun control law sparked sound and fury on Friday on both sides of the bitter U.S. debate over firearms.</p>
<p>Some said the high court had handed violent criminals a gift, while others praised it for reining in big government.</p>
<p>The court, in a 5-4 decision, deemed unconstitutional a key provision of the law that required local sheriffs to conduct background checks on prospective handgun buyers. It left intact the law's required five-day waiting period for a handgun purchase.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good day for muggers, a good day for gun runners, a good day for violent criminals -- and a very bad day for law-abiding citizens,&quot; New York Democratic Representative Charles Schumer said.</p>
<p>But Bill Carter Sr., owner of Carter's Country Guns in Houston, said he hoped there was now one less piece of paper to fill out to buy a gun. &quot;It's now harder and more paperwork to buy a handgun than it is to buy a house or a car,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The law, the first successful effort by Congress to regulate firearms in 25 years, was named after former White House press secretary James Brady, who was shot in the head in a 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>Most of its supporters said it had already done a good job in stopping guns getting into the wrong hands and that many police officers felt strongly enough about the issue to volunteer to do background checks on gun buyers.</p>
<p>The Wayne County Sheriff's Office, which covers Metropolitan Detroit, announced that it would continue making background checks despite the ruling. &quot;Most law enforcement agencies and most citizens agree that people with criminal histories should be restricted in their rights to purchase a weapon,&quot; Sheriff Robert Ficano said.</p>
<p>The White House said that since the law took effect in 1994, 250,000 felons, fugitives and mentally unstable people have been denied handguns. In addition, 27 states now require background checks on handgun purchasers.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton said he wanted police to know they could still perform background checks. &quot;My goal is clear: No criminal background check, no handgun anywhere in America. No state should become a safe haven for criminals who want to buy handguns,&quot; he said.</p>
