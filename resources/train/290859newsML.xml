<p>Mexican authorities said on Monday they had arrested 25 members of the alleged Juarez drug cartel, including 16 federal, state and municipal police officers.</p>
<p>The cartel, based in northern border city of Juarez across from El Paso, Texas, is run by Amado Carrillo, also known as &quot;The Man of the Skies,&quot; the Mexican Attorney General's Office (PGR) said in a statement.</p>
<p>The PGR said it had confiscated three Lear jets, several cars, cash and a host of rifles, handguns and ammunition following its investigation of private flights out of the Toluca international airport just west of Mexico City.</p>
<p>&quot;Three private flights that did not provide flight plans led the Attorney General's Office, with support from the Mexican Army, to apprehend 25 people presumably tied to the Juarez cartel,&quot; the news release said.</p>
<p>The police officers, some of whom boarded the Lear jet flights in uniform, were federal agents and local officers from the state of Mexico, which surrounds Mexico City, and Sinaloa, in northern Mexico along the Gulf of California coast, the PGR said.</p>
