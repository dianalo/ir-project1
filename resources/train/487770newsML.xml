<title>USA: Americans ignore British elections.</title>

<p>As usual, there was plenty of news about British personalities in American papers this week -- but mostly about the royal family in racy supermarket tabloids and very little about the British general election.</p>
<p>Most Americans seem unaware that Britons will vote to re-elect the Conservatives or replace them with the Labour Party, or are uninterested in the May 1 election's outcome.</p>
<p>Even professional political junkies say they are not paying much attention.</p>
<p>&quot;It's surprising how little interest there is. It's hardly being covered,&quot; said Allan Lichtman, a political historian with the American University. &quot;I know it's going on and that the Conservatives will probably lose, but that's about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Steven Wayne, a political scientist at Georgetown University, said he was paying some attention, but no more than he would to elections in Russia, France or elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should most Americans be concerned? Nobody has suggested there would be any change in U.S.-British relations if the Labour Party wins,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In fact, the stakes in Britain seem notably lower for the United States than last year's elections in Russia and Israel, to give two examples.</p>
<p>The lack of interest on this side of the Atlantic reflects a similar comparative lack of interest in Britain in last November's U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>It seems to indicate a weakening of the &quot;special relationship&quot; between the two nations following the end of the Cold War. Without a common Soviet threat, Britain is more and more obsessed with Europe while Americans are focused on domestic affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;In the United States, coverage of Britain consists almost exclusively of wacko stories about the royal family and Irish terrorist bombs,&quot; said Gavin Essler, a Washington television correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people don't know who the candidates are. Nobody has even raised the subject with me on my travels around the country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Coverage of the election will probably increase closer to the vote, especially if it still seems likely that Labour leader Tony Blair will win over Prime Minister John Major's Conservatives.</p>
<p>But, as the Washington Post noted in a rare editorial about the campaign, there has been a blurring of differences between the two parties.</p>
<p>The Post said there were similarities between the 1992 U.S. presidential election and the 1997 British vote as well as between Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, who won that 1992 campaign. But most commentators are not making much of the parallel, if it indeed exists.</p>
<p>The New York Times said it would be interesting to see whether Blair's rhetoric was just clever packaging &quot;or whether it represents a serious new approach to centre-left governance in an age of global markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether Blair or Major emerge victorious, large numbers of Americans will continue to avidly follow the doings of Princess Diana, Prince Charles, Prince William and Sarah Ferguson.</p>
