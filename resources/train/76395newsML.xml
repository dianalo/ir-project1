<p>The leadership of Turkey's only legal Kurdish political party went on trial on Wednesday charged with separatist activity in a case likely to disturb Turkey's human rights critics in the West.</p>
<p>Eighteen senior figures in the People's Democracy Party (HADEP), including leader Murat Bozlak, were accused of &quot;leadership of an armed gang&quot; in Ankara State Security Court.</p>
<p>They face up to 22-1/2 years in jail. Another 23, mostly rank-and-file members, could get up to 15 years under a lesser charge.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Nuh Mete Yuksel told the court, packed with family members, Western diplomats and observers, that HADEP was a legal front for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebel group.</p>
<p>&quot;HADEP is active in trying to get our citizens of Kurdish origin to join the PKK, form grassroot support for the PKK and send militants to the mountains,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The rebels are waging a 12-year-old guerrilla war in mostly-Kurdish eastern Turkey in which more than 20,000 people have died.</p>
<p>The trial opened as 20,000 Turkish troops pressed a major offensive against PKK rebels in eastern Turkey and hours after up to 11 people died in a prison riot by PKK inmates in the city of Diyarbakir.</p>
<p>A similar trial of moderate Kurdish MPs two years ago almost killed Turkey's ambitions for a customs union with Europe, granted in late 1995 by a sceptical European Parliament only after Ankara pledged to clean up extensive human rights abuses.</p>
<p>But the European Parliament threatened last week to block hundreds of millions of dollars of European Union aid to Turkey, saying the rights promises had not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>&quot;The EU is defintely focused on this trial after last week's decision,&quot; a European diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>The defendants were detained in June after masked youths tore down a large Turkish flag adorning a party congress and replaced it with the banner of the rebel group and its exiled leader Abdullah Ocalan.</p>
<p>&quot;This looks like a pretext to ban HADEP. It's following a particular pattern where the Kurdish parties get banned one after the other,&quot; said Louise Christian, a British monitor.</p>
<p>HADEP was formed in 1994 after another Kurdish party was closed by the constitutional court for alleged separatism and 13 of its deputies expelled from parliament. Six Kurd MPs were later sent to jail for links to the PKK.</p>
<p>A long charge sheet read out in court gave few details of any specific links between the defendants and the rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very clear that this is a political trial,&quot; said Sedat Yurtdas, a Kurdish former MP previously convicted by the same court for ties to the PKK.</p>
<p>HADEP does not advocate violence and stops short of urging Kurdish self-rule, a key rebel demand. The party's calls for recognition of Kurds as a distinct people got short shrift in court.</p>
<p>&quot;There is only one identity in Turkey and that is the Turkish identity,&quot; prosecutor Yuksel said, reading out the charges.</p>
<p>&quot;Requests for acknowledgement of a Kurdish cultural identity are underhand moves aimed at splitting the country. The state is one, the country is one, the nation is one,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The trial is expected to last several months.</p>
