<p>The average rate on the Romania's central bank's (BNR) one-week funds soared to 226.35 percent at Thursday's refinancing auction from 125.45 percent last week as central bank pushed on with its monetary whip.</p>
<p>The BNR's one-week funds offer of 520 billion lei, down from 600 billion the previous week, was heavily oversubscribed, with seven banks entering bids worth a total 1.87 trillion lei, at rates ranging from 130 percent to 230 percent.</p>
<p>The leap is expected to trigger a similar jump of the Lombard rate, set by multiplying the average one-week auctioned rate by 1.6. The Lombard rate, applied to overdraft credits, was previously set at 200.72 percent.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Mugur Isarescu said on Thursday his bank would use monetary levers to fight rising inflation, restore confidence in the leu, which sunk to some 9,000 to the dollar against some 4,000 since January 1.</p>
<p>Isarescu said the central bank was determined to mop up excess liquidity and to create &quot;leu hunger&quot;.</p>
<p>Interbank traders said short-term rates, which hovered near 160 percent throughout the day, were expected to rise on the upswing in the average rate on a money market facing an acute leu shortage.</p>
<p>Monthly inflation rose to 13.7 percent in January from 10.3 percent last December and is expected to soar in the months ahead after fuel, electricity and food prices liberalisation, effective from this week.</p>
<p>Year-on-year inflation was 56.9 percent last year and Isarecsu said it would climb to 89.5 percent in 1997.</p>
