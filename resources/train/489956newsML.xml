<headline>French govt ready for talks with striking doctors.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>France's Labour Minister Jacques Barrot said on Sunday he was ready to restart talks with junior hospital doctors, who have gone on strike against government plans to curb health spending, but only if they were negotiations were &quot;serious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting can be held on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. It's no problem. But it must be a serious meeting,&quot; he said in an interview on Europe 1 radio.</p>
<p>The junior doctors want the government to scrap or delay plans to fine all doctors in a region if it overshoots pre-set spending limits.</p>
<p>The government has refused these demands and accused the strikers of promoting their own sectional interests</p>
<p>On Saturday, the doctors said they were ready to meet Barrot to seek a resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>They also voted to remain on strike and called for a demonstration in Paris on April 13. They said they would resume disruptions such as blocking roads and railways.</p>
<p>The strike has hit virtually all of France's 26 teaching hospitals. But it is losing steam as the doctors feel the financial pinch of their nearly five-week-old protest.</p>
<p>The strike is testing the government's resolve to cut financial deficits to allow France to qualify for the European Union's single currency.</p>
