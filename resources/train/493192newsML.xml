<p>British Steel Plc, battered by the pound's relentless rise, faces yet another wave of profit downgrades as the company meets with analysts this week.</p>
<p>Several analysts on Tuesday issued downgrades on British Steel which sent the company's shares down 8 1/2 pence to a session low of 151p before closing at 152p. It was the most actively traded stock on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sterling's relentless climb drove it to a 4-1/2 year high against the German mark overnight and prompted Merrill Lynch on Tuesday to cut its rating on BS stock to &quot;reduce&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; and halve its fiscal 1997-98 profit forecast to 140 million pounds ($228 million).</p>
<p>The company reports its earnings in the year ended March 31, 1997 on June 16.</p>
<p>HSBC James Capel downgraded the stock to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; and cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year to 470 million pounds from 500 million.</p>
<p>Capel also reduced its forecasts for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 fiscal years to 200 million pounds from 320 million, and to 457 million from 577 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Today's moves follow a rash of downgrades by Merrill Lynch, NatWest Markets and SocGen only three months ago as the pound raced ahead.</p>
<p>Analysts say more downgrades are forthcoming, mainly because of the rise in the currency, which has appreciated by about 21 percent against the mark since August 1996.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers analyst Terrence Sinclair, who currently has a &quot;hold&quot; rating on the stock, is set to meet the company this week. He said he plans to review his profit forecasts after the meeting, as he adjusts for the pound's latest surge.</p>
<p>&quot;British Steel is facing great difficulty,&quot; Sinclair said.</p>
<p>&quot;The currency hit on its exports has already been factored in. I'm more worried about the hit it will take in the domestic market. Sterling's rise is making steel prices too high and the company is going to have to reduce prices to keep (foreign) competitors out,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>British Steel generates about 55 percent of its profits abroad. The balance is claimed in the UK.</p>
<p>The steel giant said that between two and three billion pounds of its revenues are affected by the pound-mark exchange rate, and said the currency rise had seriously damaged its competitive position.</p>
<p>One analyst, who asked not to be named, said he figured that each time the pound gained 10 pfennings, British Steel lost 100 million pounds in profits.</p>
<p>Analyst Tim Bennett of Morgan Stanley said he also planned to review his 1997-98 profit estimate, currently at 260 million pounds, after he meets with the company this week.</p>
<p>&quot;We're neutral on the stock, but our stance is to look for a better chance to sell them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The shares, which are among the most sensitive to the exchange rate, have underperformed the FTSE 100 by 21 percent during the past six months, according to data from Reuters Securities 3000.</p>
<p>Yet not all analysts have turned sour on the stock. Sanjay Jha, an analyst with Williams de Broe, said he maintained his &quot;buy&quot; rating on his belief that the dividend could be maintained.</p>
<p>&quot;Any broker can take a shot on British Steel based on the currency, but at this rate, they can still afford a dividend of 10p,&quot; Jha said. &quot;If sterling remained at this level for a year's time, then I'd be very reluctant to maintain that view, but I don't think it will.&quot;</p>
