<p>European stock markets rose on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve decided against raising interest rates, although some investors believed it was only delaying the day when rates would inevitably rise.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange markets, the dollar was mostly steady after a fall triggered when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the policy arm of the U.S. central bank, announced on Tuesday that short term rates were unchanged.</p>
<p>Markets had been divided over whether the FOMC would raise the Fed Funds rate by 0.25 percentage points as a pre-emptive strike against inflation.</p>
<p>The FOMC decision on no change boosted Wall Street, which in turn lifted the leading European markets.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been down 70 points at Tuesday's European close, later rose to close up 74.58 points or 1.03 percent at 7,303.46.</p>
<p>But the mood remained cautious, particularly in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is bright and breezy this morning but it is a bit of a knee jerk reaction,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>One trader who deals in U.S. shares said: &quot;In a couple of weeks people will start worrying about higher rates but for now the Dow looks like it will set new highs.&quot;</p>
<p>Some investors believed that, by delaying a move, the Fed would have to raise rates more when the FOMC next meets in early July. But this view was not universally shared.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of blue chips was up 32.3 points or 0.70 percent to 4,639.8 by midday on Wednesday. But domestic issues were also weighing on sentiment.</p>
<p>A decision by new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to reform financial services regulation reinforced worries about his forthcoming first budget, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;He's proved that he is a man in a fair hurry,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;People will now be looking for the tax reforms that they were worrying about before the election.&quot;</p>
<p>But news of a slowdown in broad money supply growth in April took off the pressure for a near-term British interest rate rise, economists and strategists said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd have come off the top more if it hadn't been for the M4 numbers looking like they've taken the pressure off the Bank of England putting up rates,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>M4 grew by 10.4 percent in the year to April, well above the three-to-nine percent monitoring range adopted by the previous Conservative government but below the 11.3 percent growth economists were forecasting.</p>
<p>The Paris market was also firmer following the Fed decision with the CAC 40 index up 47.32 points or 1.72 percent at 2,798.43. But business was thin. &quot;There's no volume,&quot; lamented one broker.</p>
<p>Germany rose the most of leading European markets on the Fed news. The DAX index was up 49.53 points or 1.40 percent at 3,592.96 despite the overnight tumble for the dollar, which lost nearly three pfennigs against the mark. A stronger mark adds to the problems German exporters face.</p>
<p>The dollar was stable by midday after the overnight drop which followed the FOMC announcement, although it was slightly easier than morning levels.</p>
<p>It also suffered after a senior Bank of Japan official was quoted as saying that the central bank was considering the timing of a decision on raising Japanese interest rates.</p>
<p>But later the BOJ said the official had been misquoted and tried to soothe markets by saying there were no immediate plans for a rate rise.</p>
<p>The dollar was at 113.85 yen at midday compared with 113.80 at the European close on Tuesday. It fell below 113 in late U.S. trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was at 1.6861 marks after closing in Europe on Tuesday at 1.6953 and hitting a low later of just above 1.67.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick said he had little objection to dollar/mark around 1.70 but there was no need to expect further weakness of the mark against the dollar. The comments had little effect.</p>
<p>&quot;What he said was a bit mixed so the market is a bit confused and taking it marginally negatively,&quot; said Lee Ferridge, currency strategist at Commerzbank in London.</p>
<p>Generally foreign exchange trading was slow before U.S. March trade data due at 1230 GMT on Wednesday. An average of analysts' forecasts pointed to a $10.3 billion deficit, little changed from February's $10.4 billion shortfall.</p>
<p>On precious metals, palladium was fixed at $180.50 an ounce, the highest level since April 1989 and up $0.75 from Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>STOCK PRICES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 was up 32.3 points or 0.70 percent to 4,639.8.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 index was up 47.32 points or 1.72 percent at 2,798.43.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index was up 49.53 points or 1.40 percent at 3,592.96</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.6861 marks and 113.85 yen compared with 1.6953 marks and 113.80 yen in late European trade on Tuesday.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>Gold was at $342.65 ounce, down 10 cents from Tuesday's close in London. Silver was down two cents at $4.69.</p>
