<p>China's broad M2 money supply is forecast to rise by 25 percent at the end of 1996 from 1995, the Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday, quoting central bank governor Dai Xianglong.</p>
<p>M1, or currency in circulation plus current deposits, was expected to rise by a year-on-year 17 percent at the end of the year, said Dai, governor of the People's Bank of China.  </p>
<p>M0, or cash in circulation, would grow by a year-on-year 13 percent at the end of the year, Dai said.</p>
<p>Loans extended by financial institutions in 1996 were expected to increase by about 1.0 trillion yuan ($120 billion) compared with 1995, he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>China would continue to implement a relatively tight monetary policy in 1997, setting a goal of 24 percent growth for M2 and 18 percent growth for M1, Dai said.</p>
<p>China has set a goal of an average annual growth of 23 percent for M2 and 18 percent for M1 during the Ninth Five-Year Plan between 1996 and 2000, he said.</p>
<p>($1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
