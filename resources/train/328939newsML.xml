<p>Widespread efforts to cut German health care costs were largely responsible for lower domestic pharmaceutical sales by German companies last year, a pharmaceutical industry association said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In 1996 German drugs groups sold 24.9 billion marks of goods at German pharmacies, marking a 5.4 percent increase from the year earlier, the association Verband Forschender Arzneimittelhersteller (VFA) told a news conference.</p>
<p>But in October the sales rate was still 7.4 percent above year-ago levels, the group pointed out, adding that sales at pharmacies dropped over six percent in November and December.</p>
<p>The group did not give international sales figures.</p>
<p>VFA official Horst Freisler said Germany's strict physicians' budgets, setting a ceiling for the cost of drugs prescribed annually, were largely to blame for the results.</p>
<p>The association complained that physicians were becoming extremely cautious in prescribing innovative medicines and were shying away from recommending necessary drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;The results of this budget situation is that we have confused and nervous patients, physicians and drugs companies,&quot; Freisler said.</p>
<p>The association last year already predicted that domestic sales would fall off further next year and that many groups had to bet on international sales to offset sluggish domestic conditions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless Freisler assured that German companies were not taking steps to leave this market, saying conditions for drugs research had improved last year and that companies were investing about 12 million marks in new drugs every day.</p>
<p>But Freisler also said, &quot;We are not at all sure whether we are seeing a long-term shift in conditions or whether this is just a short-term phenomenon.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite Germany's strong record in innovative science research, the nation has fallen out of favour as an industrial location as rigid labour laws, high tax rates, and restrictive laws on innovative technologies are seen to block investments.</p>
<p>German education and research minister Juergen Ruettgers however defended decisions by German companies to move operations abroad as this was the only way to secure access to growing markets which effectively also secured German jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Investing abroad is certainly not un-patriotic, after all every third job with a German company abroad secures one job in Germany,&quot; he told the news briefing.</p>
