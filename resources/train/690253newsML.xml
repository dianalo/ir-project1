<p>Insurers should become more involved in the care of accident victims, according to a report published by the London International Insurance and Reinsurance Association, on Thursday.</p>
<p>The findings of an 18-month study into UK bodily injury awards said the industry should become more involved in the provision of rehabilitation facilities to victims in an attempt to move away from the compensation culture.</p>
<p>Ashton West, General Manager of UK insurance group Iron Trades supported the findings. He said in the UK too much emphasis is placed on how future care is financed: &quot;We should move away from the desire to increase the lump sum award and focus on getting people back to work.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the insurers and the legal system should assess claimants care needs and fund them when needed rather than giving a lump sum at the outset.</p>
<p>The move would not necessarily save insurers money in the short term, particularly if they are involved in providing rehabilitation facilities such as physiotherapy, but in the long term there would be a saving.</p>
<p>The LIRMA report accused the UK of lagging behind other countries such as the U.S. in the provision of such care facilities. It said the result was additional expense but no benefit to the victim.</p>
<p>It also recommended that an independent bureau should be set up to monitor future bodily injury awards.</p>
