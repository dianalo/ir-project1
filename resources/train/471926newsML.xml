<p>State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has received four offers of Dubai crude for its May buying tender, trade sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The offers ranged in price from 10 cents over first-half month quotes to 21 cents over and were made by one trader and two producers.</p>
<p>However, traders said a question mark hung over India's appetite for Dubai crude.</p>
<p>In its April tender, the IOC awarded just two cargoes of Dubai when it normally takes around four.  </p>
<p>Traders said India's February contract to buy 3.6 million barrels of Iraqi crude over 90 days would displace some of IOC's monthly Dubai purchases.</p>
<p>IOC also received offers for Qua Iboe crude from a major and a trader. Equity producer of Qua Iboe, Mobil Corp, said earlier on Thursday that production was normal despite unrest elsewhere in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Traders said there were also four offers of Gulf of Suez crude.  </p>
<p>A Japanese trader offered the crude at flat to the official selling price (OSP) and a second was offered at three cents over OSP from a producer.</p>
<p>A European major and a western trader offered Gulf of Suez on a dated-Brent basis.</p>
