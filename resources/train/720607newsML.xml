<headline>BG Bank says too soon to mull new alliance.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-07-10</dateline>

<p>BG Bank, Denmark's third-largest, said on Thursday that following the breakdown of merger talks with mortgage lender Nykredit market rumours of a forthcoming marriage with other banks were premature.</p>
<p>&quot;It could well be that we have to adopt a new strategy in some years' time, but it is still far too early to say whether a new alliance would involve a merger with Unidanmark or any other partner,&quot; BG Bank managing director Henrik Thufason told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>In June, Denmark's leading mortgage lender Nykredit, BG Bank and third biggest insurer Topdanmark cancelled their strategic alliance after Nykredit directors ruled against a full merger.</p>
<p>The three partners said they would maintain collaboration in some fields.</p>
<p>Since then rumours have circulated in the markets of a possible new strategic alliance or merger between BG Bank and the second biggest bank Unidanmark or another lender.</p>
<p>&quot;I can understand that some analysts consider a merger between BG Bank and Unidanmark to be obvious because of the possibility of making considerable costs savings, but we have not discussed the matter, nor do we have any plans to do so, &quot; Thufason said.</p>
<p>&quot;BG Bank is doing well at the moment. We delivered a very good 1996 result and there is absolutely no sign that we should not do the same again in 1997, &quot; he said, adding that the bank increased market share in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>He did not give figures.</p>
<p>In February BG Bank posted 1996 profits before tax and extraordinary items of 1.938 billion crowns, compared to 1995's 1.885 billion crowns and more than doubled its dividend to 12 percent.</p>
<p>Thufason said that a recent EU court ruling giving tax breaks on in-house data processing could save the bank between 75 and 100 million crowns annually.</p>
