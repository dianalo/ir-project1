<p>A leading Indian health organisation said on Saturday it will step up a campaign this year against tobacco companies' sponsorship of sporting events.</p>
<p>An estimated 800,000 to one million people die in India due to tobacco-related diseases every year, the Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI), a non-governmental body, said in a statement.</p>
<p>India is the world's third largest tobacco producer. About 85 percent of the output is consumed in the domestic market.</p>
<p>&quot;This year, to commemorate World No-Tobacco Day (May 31), VHAI will not merely continue its earlier initiative in the area but will also focus on its major concerns,&quot; VHAI's head of public policy, Mira Shiva, said.</p>
<p>The statement said a key concern was &quot;misuse of sports and cultural events for the promotion of these hazardous products through surrogate advertisements.&quot;</p>
<p>Tobacco advertisement is banned on Indian television but activists say sports sponsorships or promotion of cigarette brands by the sale of sports gear or other goods bearing familiar tobacco trademarks promote smoking.</p>
<p>Last year, anti-tobacco activists mounted a protest against the sponsorship of the World Cup in cricket held in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka by cigarette-maker ITC Ltd through its Wills brand.</p>
<p>Britain's new Labour government earlier this month announced it was banning sponsorship of sporting events by tobacco companies, hitting hard some of the country's tournaments, including leading cricket trophies.</p>
<p>&quot;Tobacco sponsorship of sports creates subconscious positive images of the relationship between smoking and existing activities,&quot; VHAI said.</p>
<p>Shiva said VHAI was also concerned about the impact of passive smoking on women and children and continued smoking in public places, public transport and work places.</p>
<p>In January this year, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) government in Delhi banned smoking in government offices, educational institutions, hospitals, cinemas, restaurants and public transport.</p>
<p>But the state government's rules are difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>Many areas in the federal capital, New Delhi, technically fall outside the writ of Delhi's state government as they come under the federal authorities.</p>
