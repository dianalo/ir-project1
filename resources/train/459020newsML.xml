<title>CANADA: Geac jumps on stronger operating results.</title>
<headline>Geac jumps on stronger operating results.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-03-21</dateline>

<p>Geac Computer Corp Ltd jumped in active dealings on Friday as investors cheered unexpected gains in third quarter operating income, despite a substantial third quarter charge.</p>
<p>&quot;The operating results and cash flow were way better,&quot; said Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon analyst Mark Lawrence.</p>
<p>Third quarter operating income soared 49 percent to C$15.2 million from a year-earlier C$10.2 million before it took a C$121.4 million write-off for software, goodwill, inventory and fixed assets.</p>
<p>Shares in the computer firm rose 4.35 to 36.25 on volume of more than 170,000 shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>Geac, which reported a third quarter loss of C$3.71 a share compared to a year-earlier earnings of C$0.30 a share, said in a news release that it managed to maintain a high cash flow despite acquiring and absorbing Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software Services Inc.</p>
<p>Lawrence said he was surprised since he had expected the company to barely break even on its operating results.</p>
<p>Another analyst, who declined to be identified, said the results were questionable given that Geac itself said its purchase of money-losing Dun &amp; Bradstreet for US$150 million in cash and a US$41.25 million note was a little bit pricey.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's no way that (Geac) can turn it around in one quarter,&quot; the analyst said. &quot;I'm very suspicious, very suspicious of what's behind all this.&quot;</p>
<p>Lawrence, who was more bullish, noted the write-down did not include cash.</p>
<p>Lawrence added that as a result of Geac's strong operating income he would increase his earnings estimates upward from his original C$2.44 a share and forecast the stock would be worth as much as C$60 by the end of calendar 1997.</p>
