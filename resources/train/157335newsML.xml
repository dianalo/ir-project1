<p>Shipping Minister Mohamed Ashraff on Thursday removed the chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and appointed the head of the national shipping line in his place, the ministry said.</p>
<p>A spokesman said Ranjith Wickremasinghe, chairman of the Ceylon Shipping Corporation, was made head of the SLPA &quot;with the objective of re-organising the SLPA to meet the challenges that (it) is envisaged to face in the near future.&quot;</p>
<p>The SLPA runs Colombo port, south Asia's trans-shipment hub, with a capacity of was 1.6 million containers.  </p>
<p>A ministry statement said SLPA chairman Sundra Jayawardene will take over from Wickremasinghe as head of the national shipping line.</p>
<p>The statement gave no other reason for the change, but shipping officials said Jayawardene had little experience in shipping.</p>
<p>Shipping analysts said the change could also be related to talks the SLPA is holding with Peninsula &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Co to set up a container terminal at the port.</p>
<p>Jayawardene told Reuters recently that the SLPA wants to develop the southern part of the port to have at least another six deep-draft berths, for fifth and sixth generation ships, with a capacity of two million container per year.</p>
<p>The cost of the project is estimated at around one billion dollars and will take ten years to build, he said.  </p>
<p>Under the deal being negotiated, P&amp;O and local partner John Keells Holdings will develop the Queen Elizabeth Quay, one of the port's two main quays, and the adjacent sea area.</p>
