<p>Infrastructure and Utilities Ltd (Infratil) said on Tuesday its portfolio had a market value by March 31 of about NZ$243.5 million against $141.9 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The figure includes cash and is adjusted for tax on holdings in Infratil Securities.</p>
<p>Infratil earlier reported a net profit after tax but before investment realisations of NZ$5.70 million in the year to March from $3.25 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Including investment realisations, net profit after tax was NZ$6.32 million against NZ$4.34 million. </p>
<p>Based on market prices as at May 5, net tangible asset backing was 128.7cps, up from 121.9 cents at March 31.</p>
<p>In the six months to March, the company had finalised a merger between CentralPower and ElectroPower, the Palmerston North-based electricity distributor.</p>
<p>As a result of the merger the Palmerston North City Council became a 30.4 percent shareholder in Centralpower and Infratil's shareholding in the combined entity was diluted to 16.6 percent.</p>
<p>But Infratil had since increased its shareholding in CentralPower to 19.8 percent, the company said.</p>
