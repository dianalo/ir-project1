<p>The western U.S. Midwest on Friday will likely see the hottest temperatures so far this year, followed by widespread rains over the weekend, meteorologists said.</p>
<p>&quot;These are going to be the best growing degree days of the year,&quot; said Fred Gesser, chief forecaster for Weather Express in Nebraska. Growing degree days refer to the amount of heat units a plant receives.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday was the hottest day in the western Corn Belt and today will match or exceed that,&quot; he added. The hot weather should cover Nebraska, southern Iowa and Illinois.</p>
<p>Temperatures were expected to peak in the 90s Fahrenheit from Nebraska to Illinois with upper 80s in Indiana and Ohio.</p>
<p>Rains moved across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota overnight but forecasters said coverage was lighter than expected. Some dry portions of northwest Iowa and southwest Minnesota largely missed out on the moisture, said Joel Burgio, meteorologist with Weather Services Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Rains were a little less than expected in general coverage,&quot; Burgio said. &quot;There were two bands of thunderstorms that moved through that region but the coverage of that area wasn't too high.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Sioux City, Iowa, received only 0.02 inch of rain while nearby Sioux Falls, South Dakota, received 0.45 inch.</p>
<p>The weekend should bring another shot at precipitation for Iowa and Minnesota with rains also expected in Illinois, southern Wisconsin and northern Missouri.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a good deal of thunderstorms in the forecast throughout most of the western Corn Belt and northern half of the eastern Corn Belt in the next 24 hours,&quot; Burgio said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking for at least 0.50 to 2.00 inches, with the biggest rains in southern and eastern Iowa, northern Illinois, and southern Wisconsin over the next 24 to 48 hours.&quot;</p>
<p>Gesser predicted 0.25 to 1.50 inches with 60 to 70 percent coverage across the western two-thirds of the belt.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news is we get some rains in Iowa and central Illinois where we do have some dry conditions,&quot; Gesser said. &quot;The bad news is Minnesota got pretty much all they're going to get.&quot;</p>
<p>Long-range outlooks showed another storm system moving across the northwest and northern portions of the Corn Belt Monday through Wednesday.</p>
