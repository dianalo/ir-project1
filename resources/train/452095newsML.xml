<title>USA: US OPTIONS FOCUS - Sentiment mixed on high techs.</title>
<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS - Sentiment mixed on high techs.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>The recent selloff in U.S. technology stocks gathered steam Wednesday, but options investors were buying and selling as sentiment on the overall group remained mixed, traders said.</p>
<p>In late trading, the Nasdaq 100 index was down 16.05 points, or nearly two percent, at 811.52. It reached a session low of 798.25 before recovering.</p>
<p>The index is comprised of the 100 largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock market. NDX options trade at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).  </p>
<p>NDX options are not frequently active, but on Wednesday, traders said activity was heavy, particularly in the March series, which expires at the end of the week.</p>
<p>The March 830 call was most active with turnover of about 2,420 contracts. The march 820 call traded 2,385 and the March 820 put traded 2,130.</p>
<p>Trading was steady in most April options as well as select May contracts.</p>
<p>One NDX options trader said investors were on both sides of the market, buying and selling the calls and puts.  </p>
<p>He added that some of the heavy March action was likely from investors closing out positions, some of which were most likely rolled out into April.</p>
<p>&quot;They're bouncing all over the lot,&quot; Hank Nothnagel, head of options trading at EVEREN Securities, said of some of the NDX options. &quot;Big swings and big spreads.&quot;</p>
<p>Jesse Stamer, a general partner at TradeNet in Chicago, said some investors were taking profits on puts.</p>
<p>He said that with some of the technology indices reaching levels not seen in several months, &quot;this is probably a good price if you're long puts to get out and take a look.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are probably more sellers of puts than anything,&quot; he added. &quot;I think people had anticipated this move down and are now taking profits.&quot;</p>
<p>Stamer is a designated primary market maker in several technology stocks and the CBOE's technology index TXX.</p>
<p>The TXX was down 4.07, or 2.20 percent, at 181.22 in afternoon trading. It reached 177.93 intraday.</p>
<p>&quot;This would be a good level for technology indices at least, if you're short, to cover and take another look at them over the next few weeks and months,&quot; Stamer said.  </p>
<p>Options on individual technology stocks were among the most active at all exchanges.</p>
<p>At the AMEX, Intel Corp options were the most active group, led by the March 135 call, which traded about 5,850 contracts. Overall, Intel puts were busier than calls.</p>
<p>Intel shares were down 2-1/2 at 134-1/4 in late trade after falling to 132 intraday.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the nervous money is flowing out,&quot; Andrew Schwarz, senior partner at AGS Specialist Partners at the AMEX, said. &quot;We're seeing a move toward puts, so people are running to protection and historically that's a bullish sign.&quot;</p>
