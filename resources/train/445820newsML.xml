<p>Emanuel Ungaro's panther, leopard and snake motifs read like a zoological inventory.</p>
<p>The French designer's animal theme, set against a feline-hide backdrop, took well-trodden paths on Sunday with leopard-skin trouser suits, panther-motif liquid chiffon under multi-coloured plaid jackets and a python leather blazer over a chocolate lace cocktail dress.</p>
<p>More inspired, although not ground-breaking, were fur hats that framed model's faces liked desert turbans, dark jersey and velvet separates blooming with fuchsia roses and Chinoiserie ensembles that are this season's must-haves, with satin pyjama trousers and quilted jackets.</p>
<p>&quot;When I start a collection it's just intuition, passion, love, colour, material -- like a minestrone soup. The sole concept is really about the discipline and rigour of cut, and the fantasy of colours and materials,&quot; Ungaro told reporters backstage.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea is that a blind woman can wake up in the morning, go to her closet, and just pulls out different pieces and they all work together,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>For Jacques Fath's Autumn Winter collection, stylist Tom Van Lingen turned out snappy, tailored jackets of grey flannel, paired with slim matching dresses to mid calf or with bronze jersey separates.</p>
<p>The sharp shoulders, intricate mosaic inlays or wide shawl collars that dropped down the back as a necktie displayed the designer's flare for unusual, couture-like cutting.</p>
<p>For cocktails, Van Lingen displayed his skill in the meticulous draping of irridescent taffeta sheaths, or the shadow of a jacket bottom reproduced in shiny panels on black evening gowns. The violet taffeta curved over the neckline of a black faille sheath, and billowed to a train in back.</p>
<p>Executives announced that the decades-old fashion house, which was controlled by troubled state-banking giant Credit Lyonnais, has just been sold to ready-to-wear firm Emmanuelle Khanh for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Francois Barthes, president of Emmanuelle Khanh, said the two labels were &quot;complementary&quot; and he planned to develop Jacques Fath's evening wear &quot;in order to boost the label's international stature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sexy-bitchy attitude!&quot; and &quot;No hand on hips please!&quot; or &quot;Walk fast!&quot; read the unequivocal instructions for models backstage before Valentino's show.</p>
<p>The Italian designer described his collection as &quot;feminine, sexy and tough&quot;, and for those hard-nosed women Valentino was targeting, there were killer spike-heeled vinyl boots, aggressive gold-streaking on red and black silks, and hulking Mongolian lamb bombers.</p>
<p>The soft side came in Japanese florals, silver kimonos and lurex cocktail dresses made mean with ostrich feather ruffs.</p>
<p>Christian Lacroix snapped the fashion crowd from its torpor on Saturday with a wild riot of colour and chaotic patchwork of genres that defied the pre-set rules of establishment fashion.</p>
<p>He paired the blue suede trousers of a flower child with the damask jacket of a 18th century duchess, or put the whalebone stays of a hoop skirt in the leg o'mutton sleeves of a black satin tunic, worn on a skirt encrusted with lace and pearls.</p>
<p>But his wacky collage of colours, fabrics and styles was as deliberately constructed as the orchid embroidered on a salmon evening dress or the lace-trimmed cuffs of a blue tweed jacket.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very spirited,&quot; said Joan Kaner of Neiman Marcus department stores. &quot;It was Lacroix at his zaniest and wittiest. The pieces were beautiful and he put them together in an amusing way. But we'll put them together differently for our customers.&quot;</p>
