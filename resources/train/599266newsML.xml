<p>The Algerian government, fighting a violent Moslem militant campaign, offered residents up to 4.5 million dinars ($80,357) for information leading to the capture or killing of Algeria's most wanted guerrillas.</p>
<p>The government's proposed reward appeared in posters put up on walls in several suburbs of Algiers, residents, speaking by telephone from the Algerian capital, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The names of the most feared Armed Islamic Group (GIA) chief Antar Zouabri and his rival Islamic Salvation Army (AIS) Madani Mezrag as well as his deputy Ahmed Benaicha topped the posters, residents said.</p>
<p>The GIA and its rival AIS, the armed wing of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), have been staging a five-year- old guerrilla campaign to topple the government and turn Algeria into a Moslem fundamentalist state.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in the five years of violence since 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which the FIS had taken a commanding lead.</p>
<p>The government also offered up to three million dinars ($53,570) for tip-offs on three leading guerrilla figures -- Said Makhloufi, Mustapaha Kartali and Miloud Habbi.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, security forces killed 28 rebels in operations carried out in the western provinces of Tissemsilt and Saida over the past few days, the Algerian newspaper El Watan said on Tuesday without giving details.</p>
<p>Two home-made bombs exploded on Sunday south of Algiers, causing material damage only, added El Watan.</p>
