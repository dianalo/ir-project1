<p>Arab states have agreed to make a link between relations with Israel and progress in peace talks between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbours, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was consensus on the need to link relations with progress in the peace progress,&quot; he told reporters on arrival for the closing session of an Arab League meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not just a Syrian demand but a general Arab demand. The decision is up to Arab presidents and kings,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Shara's remarks echoed the decision by Arab heads of state at a summit meeting in Cairo in June but diplomats said late on Saturday that Arab ministers had looked at specific proposals to put this into effect.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters on Saturday that the ministers, meeting in Cairo since Friday, had decided on a course of action to put to the heads of state. He declined to give any details at this stage.</p>
<p>Moussa flew to the Mediterranean city of Alexandria on Sunday morning to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the ministerial decision and Mubarak is expected to consult with other Arab leaders by telephone.</p>
<p>The diplomats said one Syrian proposal was that other states join in the Syrian and Lebanese boycott of all multilateral talks with the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Diplomats said bilateral negotiations with Israel were also under scrutiny, in view of the new Israeli government's reluctance to meet longstanding Palestinian demands or accept the principle of withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposals are on cutting the (bilateral) negotiations down to size and adopting the same method in the negotiations as Israel is doing now,&quot; said one diplomatic source.</p>
<p>A decision to pull out of the multilateral talks would wreck plans to hold a Middle East economic conference in Cairo in November -- an event already in doubt because of Egypt's unhappiness with the right-wing government in Israel.</p>
<p>The aim of the conference, conceived when the dovish Labour party government was still in power in Israel, would be to integrate Israel into the regional economy.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chided Egypt on Sunday for tying the conference to further moves by the Jewish state.</p>
<p>&quot;To threaten us, as pressure on us, to cancel the Cairo conference, is like a man who cuts off his nose to spite his face. We are not seriously listening to these things,&quot; Netanyahu told Israel Radio in an interview marking the Jewish New Year.</p>
<p>Shara noted that the Cairo summit in June had already made the link between relations and progress in peace talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The results of the Arab summit must be translated tangibly to defend the peace process,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;After the ministers discussed this, a report has been submitted to Mr Mubarak and in his turn he will submit it to the Arab leaders to discuss,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Arab ministers met again on Sunday morning for what is the final session in the formal Arab League meeting.</p>
<p>The ministerial meeetings have concentrated on Middle East peace, with less attention given to events in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>But in an Arab League statement on Saturday night the ministers condemned Turkish, Iranian or any other intervention in northern Iraq and said a proposed Turkish buffer zone there -- aimed at halting Turkish Kurdish rebel infiltration -- would be a violation of Iraqi territory.</p>
<p>&quot;The Council strongly condemns the intervention by some neighbouring countries in the internal affairs of the territory of an Arab League member state,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The statement mentioned Turkey by name but not Iran, which has supported the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan against the Baghdad-backed Kurdistan Democratic Party.</p>
