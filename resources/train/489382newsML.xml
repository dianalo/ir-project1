<p>About 3,500 workers struck General Motors Corp.'s Oklahoma City car plant early Saturday over demands for more jobs in a walkout that could cut off supplies of two important new GM car models.</p>
<p>Members of United Auto Workers Local 1999 struck after a 12:59 a.m. EST (0559 GMT) deadline expired with no tentative agreement on a new local labor contract with the automaker.</p>
<p>&quot;They went out. Everybody's already at the gate picketing,&quot; said Judy Calhoun, a spokeswoman for Local 1999.</p>
<p>GM spokesman Charles Licari said negotiations had been recessed to allow negotiators to get some sleep, and were scheduled to resume at about 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Saturday. Talks had continued late into the evening most nights during the past week.</p>
<p>The plant is the main production source for GM's new Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Cutlass mid-size sedans. A prolonged strike could deprive GM dealers of the cars in the midst of the automaker's multimillion dollar national advertising launch for them.</p>
<p>The Malibu and Cutlass, priced at about $16,000 to $18,000, are a cornerstone of GM's efforts to regain market share in the hotly contested U.S. intermediate car segment, which it once dominated.</p>
<p>GM this week reported stronger-than-expected March U.S. sales of the Malibu, which increased to 12,260 cars from 5,800 in February.</p>
<p>The main sticking point in the negotiations, as in most recent GM labor disputes, is jobs. The union has said it wants GM to hire about 500 new workers to help restore jobs lost to retirements in recent months.</p>
<p>The union contends that its members are being forced to endure an increased workload that is resulting in increased numbers of repetitive strain injuries. &quot;These jobs are just too overloaded,&quot; Calhoun said. &quot;They're hurting people.&quot;</p>
<p>Licari said GM was disappointed in the work stoppage, but said it will try to negotiate an agreement that allows it to be competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to bargain in good faith towards an agreement that serves all of our interests,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>GM believes the plant can continue to operate with about 3,500 workers, a level that makes it competitive with some of the most efficient car plants in North America, including those run by Ford Motor Co and Honda Motor Co. Ltd.</p>
<p>Late last year, when GM launched production of the Malibu and Cutlass, it let go about 900 temporary workers hired to fill in for retired workers.</p>
<p>While the automaker needed the extra workers to build previous models -- the Buick Century and Oldsmobile Ciera -- it contends it doesn't need as many workers to build the Malibu and Cutlass, which were specifically designed to be easier to build, with fewer parts and lower assembly costs.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old Oklahoma City plant, which never before had a strike, recently launched production of the all-new Cutlass and Malibu and is up to about 80 percent of its full production capacity. A second plant, in Wilmington, Del., just began production of Malibus about two weeks ago, but is much farther behind on its launch curve.</p>
<p>GM last week settled a nearly two-week strike at its Fort Wayne, Ind., pickup truck plant in a deal that calls for the company to add 276 new workers to the factory's payroll. Most of the workers are expected to be transferred from other GM facilities that have excess workers.</p>
<p>Union sources say there are several other GM plants that have asked UAW headquarters for permission to strike because of slow progress in local negotiations, including a GM transmission plant in Warren, Mich., a foundry in Saginaw, Mich., and another pickup truck assembly plant in Pontiac, Mich.</p>
