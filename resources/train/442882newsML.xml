<p>California Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday rejected a request from the U.S. Interior Department to conduct joint tests on the safety of the Mojave Desert site where the state wants to build a low-level nuclear waste dump.</p>
<p>In a letter to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Wilson said the state would proceed with its own study on the site for the proposed Ward Valley dump for radioactive waste from hospitals, universities and biotechnlogy companies.</p>
<p>The letter is the latest in the dispute between the state and the Interior Department over the proposed site, with Wilson complaining that the federal agency has stalled on conveying the federal land for the dump.</p>
<p>Last month, the Interior Department urged California to work with it on tests to see whether water could percolate down and carry radioactivity into groundwater near the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water for millions of people.</p>
<p>But Wilson said the Energy Department and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were the only federal agencies with expertise on radiation safety, and said he saw the Interior Department's suggestion as a delaying tactic.</p>
<p>The Interior Secretary in the Bush administration, Manuel Lujan, had approved the transfer of the land to California. But Babbitt, backed by a number of environmental groups, stopped the transfer pending further review.</p>
<p>Wilson also said his state, through the Freedom of Information Act, got an Energy Department staff position paper written more than a year ago that said the Interior Department's requests for more tests &quot;are based solely on politics and not the health and safety of Californians.&quot;</p>
<p>Wilson, a Republican, said in a statement he turned the paper over to California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and other senators, and asked for an &quot;investigation of the Clinton administration's political stonewalling and delay in transferring the land to the state of California.&quot;</p>
<p>A response from the Interior Department was not immediately available.</p>
<p>California also has sued the Interior Department to try to force it to turn over the land.</p>
<p>The state is legally obligated to store the waste produced from facilities in-state as well as Arizona, and North and South Dakota. Until it has a facility, the waste is being stored on-site or is being shipped to an Energy Department facility in South Carolina.</p>
