<p>CBOT soymeal futures ended mixed and soyoil ended lower, with July contracts under pressure from liquidation before first notice day Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is just getting out,&quot; said one soyoil trader.</p>
<p>July soymeal was also under pressure from weakness in U.S. and Brazilian cash and export markets. U.S. processors are said to be holding inventory, and South American basis is slipping, soymeal traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are soft in the (U.S.) interior and weaker in Brazil,&quot; said one soy complex trader. &quot;People are having a hard time getting rid of meal.&quot;</p>
<p>Soymeal found some support from U.S. Census Bureau crushing data, but the data was said to be a little bearish for soyoil, traders said.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday, the Census Bureau put soymeal stocks in May at 256,527 tons, which was below the trade average of 315,250 tons.</p>
<p>July soymeal closed down $0.80 per ton at $272.90, and other months settled 0.90 to $3.90 higher. Soyoil closed 0.01 to 0.07 cent a lb lower, with July down 0.02 at 22.73.  </p>
<p>The Census bureau put soyoil stocks at 2.143 billion lbs, which was above the average estimate for 2.112 billion lbs.</p>
<p>Also after the close, an official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that Pakistan was close to signing PL-480 deal for soymeal valued at $10 million.</p>
<p>In soymeal trade, Smith Barney bought 600 July, 200 August and 200 September. Prudential Securities bought 300 lots July, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In soymeal spread trade, ABN Amro Chicago Corp spread 400 December/July and Cargill Investor Services spread 300 August/July, traders said.</p>
<p>In soyoil trade on the day, ABN Amro Chicago Corp sold 400 lots December and FIMAT Futures Inc sold 600 lots of July. ADM and Cargill were buyers in most contracts.</p>
<p>Soymeal futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 22,000 lots, compared with Monday's actual volume of 24,664 lots. Soyoil volume was pegged at 16,000 lots, against Monday's 20,685.</p>
