<p>The air cargo industry is under increasing pressure to reduce costs as manufacturers seek a leaner and more effective distribution system, experts said at a conference which ended here on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A number of speakers said quality of service was at least as important as cost.</p>
<p>Production to order in Asia by firms who aim for a 48 hour delivery time anywhere in the world is a trend expected to becoming increasingly important and will fuel the rapid growth of air cargo, speakers said.</p>
<p>&quot;In this business now, the computer is the warehouse,&quot; said Donald Cameron, manager of corporate logistics at the U.S. Bose Corporation, which manufactures high-value audio-equipment.</p>
<p>In forecasts to 2015, Boeing Co expected cargo traffic to expand at an annual average of 6.6 percent, Airbus Industrie at 6.7 percent, while McDonnell Douglas forecast 7.4 percent.</p>
<p>Boeing forecast the express component to rise at an annual 18 percent until it accounts for some 37 percent of global airfreight by 2015 from five percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Overall the industry is estimated to generate annual revenues estimated at between $42 billion and $50 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;What we need is a global door to door service....  which meets both our needs and the increasingly specific demands of our customers,&quot; said Philippe Oddone, chairman of France's National Commission for Transport Users and logistics chief at Yves Saint Laurent.</p>
<p>&quot;These customer demands include running reduced stock, reduced delivery times, more frequent deliveries, direct shipment to the point of sale and decreases in the actual size of shipments,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>YSL ships some 10,000 tonnes of cosmetics and perfumes annually to 145 countries with 25 percent or 2,500 tonnes moving by air,&quot;as the latter can help to cut lead delivery times,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Along with other speakers, he underlined the need for better communication between shippers and transport providers, whether freight forwarders or airlines.</p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of electronic data interchange(EDI) can help this and enable the shipper and the customer at any moment to know where their goods are. This is linked to ensuring continous security for our high-value products. Every hour at an airport or on a platform is an opportunity for theft,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The excessive length of time taken for airfreight to be handled on the ground was criticised by the past president Walter Johnson of The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) which organised the forum.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten years ago in Basle, we discovered air freight spent 91 percent of its time on the ground and nothing has changed. It is disgraceful,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>A recent survey by Unisys Corp showed air cargo shipments still take an average six days from shipper to customer, or unchanged in 25 years.</p>
<p>It &quot;presents a picture of an industry operating not so much in the fast lane, but one of travelling sluggishly in the slow lane,&quot; said TIACA president and Emirates airlines senior general manager cargo, Ram C.Menen who stressed the need for action if the industry is to survive.</p>
<p>Wednesday was dominated by a clash between shippers seeking cost-effective quality services and forwarders, worried of a reduced role by direct contact between airlines and shippers.</p>
<p>&quot;Shippers have obtained tremendous savings through using forwarders and airlines. The reason for tremendous profits in the electronic industry is that today, they have no inventories,&quot; said Guenter Rohrmann, president and CEO of the U.S, based Air Express International.</p>
<p>Peter Gatti from the U.S. National Industrial Transportation League (NITL) summing up the concern of shippers said &quot;forwarders are very nervous and ... want to keep airlines away from the shipper. They want to control the business, but if they do not talk to customers, they will be unable to deliver the right product.&quot;</p>
