<p>Inco Ltd's massive Voisey's Bay nickel mining operation could be delayed by another year if a Canadian native group succeeds in stopping two construction projects at the site, analysts said.</p>
<p>A Supreme Court of Newfoundland judge on Friday will deliver his ruling on the Labrador Inuit Association's bid to block construction of an airstrip and road for the project.</p>
<p>The Inuit group has argued that the projects are production work and should not be approved by the Newfoundland government until a broader environmental review of Voisey's Bay is completed.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Inco maintains the airstrip and road are needed to support ongoing exploration of the site.</p>
<p>Voisey's Bay, one of the world's biggest nickel-copper-cobalt deposits, is slated to start producing concentrate in late 1999 and refined nickel by late 2000. Annual output is forecast at 270 million pounds of nickel when the mine reaches full production in 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still holding to our original timetable at least until this court decision. We're hoping he rules in our favor,&quot; said Inco spokesman David Allen.</p>
<p>Analysts said other factors could delay construction. A source of electricity for the nickel smelter has not been decided yet and negotiations between the Newfoundland government and aboriginal groups to resolve land claims at Voisey's Bay continue to drag on.</p>
<p>&quot;Voisey's Bay's schedule is likely to slip beyond the 1999 startup date projected by Inco,&quot; brokerage Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a report this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Until this has been recognized by the market, we would not be in a hurry to buy Inco shares,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Inco chairman and chief executive officer Michael Sopko has said Labrador's severe winter weather limits construction to about six months a year. If work does not begin this summer, Sopko hinted earlier this month that Inco would have to wait a year before construction can begin.</p>
<p>Manford Mallory, an analyst at Research Capital Corp, said a delay would be disappointing for shareholders of Voisey's Bay Nickel Co, an Inco subsidiary.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously the payoff for them is getting that project into production and hoping to get some dividends at some point,&quot; Mallory said.</p>
<p>But Inco's other operations would perhaps benefit if nickel from Voisey's Bay hit the market later than planned.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure they're not hoping for it, but if that does happen it potentially could keep the nickel price stronger for their other sales for a year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Voisey's Bay Nickel shares were off 0.20 at 26 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday, while Inco's stock was down 0.55 at 40.65.</p>
