<p>The city around them was a charred and ruined landscape but the mood on the faces of Chechens waiting to vote in Monday's presidential elections was unmistakably festive and upbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;For us, today is a holiday. It is proof that we are an independent nation of civilised people, not the wild neanderthals that the Russians think we are,&quot; said Fatima Adiyeva, 37, as she waited in freezing temperatures to cast her ballot at Grozny's polling station number 12.</p>
<p>The centre of the Chechen capital was ground zero during most of the 21-month fighting between rebel guerrillas and Russian troops sent in to crush the tiny Moslem region's independence bid.</p>
<p>Most of the multi-storey buildings here are nothing more than blackened, pockmarked skeletons, monuments to the savage intensity of Russian aerial and artillery bombing. All Russian troops have now withdrawn from the breakaway region.</p>
<p>Polling station 12 has been carved out of destruction. Only the ground floor is intact. The other three storeys are empty and burned out, their once-elegant yellow exterior riddled with bullet holes.</p>
<p>Adiyeva, who had already stood in line for over an hour in the cold, had her central Grozny home flattened in the early days of the war.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a five-storey building over there. That is where my apartment was,&quot; she said, pointing to an uneven pile of bricks and twisted metal.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been deprived of everything I own, except hope,&quot; she said, clad in a coloured headscarf and stomping her feet in the snow to keep warm.</p>
<p>Many in the crowd said they saw Monday's elections as proof that the world would soon regard Chechnya as an independent state, despite Russia's warnings that it would sever diplomatic ties with any country which recognises Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a good mood because we feel that our lives are starting over again. Allah hasn't taken that away from us,&quot; said her smiling friend Raia.</p>
<p>Like many people interviewed, the two women said they would vote for Aslan Maskhadov, the mild-mannered grey-haired guerrilla commander who masterminded his irregular army's victory and negotiated a peace plan with Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;All of my hope is on Maskhadov. He's tactful and he knows how to find common ground with people,&quot; said Adiyeva.</p>
<p>But Adiyeva, like most others, said she had great respect for the other main candidates such as Shamil Basayev, a field commander wanted as a &quot;terrorist&quot; in Russia for leading a bloody hostage-taking mission in a Russian hosptial in 1995 that forced the Russians to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>&quot;All of our candidates are deserving and dignified. Basayev is our national hero but Maskhadov will be our president,&quot; said Adiyeva.</p>
<p>In the tiny village of Permomaiskoye, five km (three miles) northwest of Grozny, residents pushed and shoved their way towards voting booths.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got chores to do at home, let us through,&quot; cackled a group of rotund farm women with silver teeth.</p>
<p>Inside, the hall was decked out with portraits of the late Dzhokhar Dudayev, the separatist leader who declared Chechnya's independence in 1991, and photographs of local fighters killed during the conflict. A large green and red Chechen national flag towered over the building.</p>
<p>Election officials say the turnout is very high and have been forced to extend polling an additional two hours because they say local officials cannot cope with the flow of voters.</p>
