<headline>Sylvan says plans to proceed with deal.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sylvan Learning Systems Inc said it still intends to proceed with its planned stock acquisition of National Education Corp, despite an announcement that a rival bidder is now in talks to acquire the company at a higher price.</p>
<p>&quot;We still intend to pursue it as planned,&quot; said Sylvan spokeswoman Vickie Glazar.</p>
<p>She had no immediate comment on whether or not Sylvan would be willing to raise its offer, or change it to cash to compete with the bid from Harcourt General Inc.  </p>
<p>Harcourt, which last month made an offer of $740 million for National Education, said earlier on Thursday that it may raise its offer to $21 per share, or $777 million, up from its original offer of $19.50, or $740 million.</p>
<p>The existing plan with Sylvan, which calls for shareholders of National Education to receive 0.58 share of Sylvan for each share held, is worth $671 million based on Sylvan's stock price of $31-1/4.</p>
<p>Harcourt earlier said it would raise its offer to $21 per share pending the completion of due diligence.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Harcourt declined to say when the two companies started negotiations. Harcourt said that, if the negotiations did not succeed, it will continue its offer to buy NEC at $19.50 per share.</p>
