<p>Cambodian authorities are to release sketches of three suspects wanted in connection with a bloody grenade attack on an opposition rally in Phnom Penh in March, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>General Yeng Marady, deputy national police chief, said sketches of the three would be released this week.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been assisting Cambodian authorities in their investigation of the March 30 attack on a demonstration led by opposition leader Sam Rainsy which left up to 19 dead and more than 100 wounded.</p>
<p>&quot;The FBI has drawn three pictures, faces of men, where they were standing and where they ran. The police will release these pictures in a few days,&quot; Yeng Marady told Reuters.</p>
<p>No arrests have so far been made in connection with the attack but Sam Rainsy, an outspoken former finance minister who narrowly escaped injury in the blasts, has suggested his main political rival, co-Premier Hun Sen, may be linked to the incident.</p>
<p>Sam Rainsy is a political ally of First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Ranariddh and Hun Sen have been waging a bitter war of words in recent months over various disagreements, including power-sharing in their coalition government.</p>
<p>Hun Sen was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday but an aide, Om Yinteang, said Sam Rainsy was trying to damage Hun Sen's reputation.</p>
<p>&quot;He's trying to discredit the Second Prime Minister (Hun Sen),&quot; Om Yinteang told Reuters. &quot;We have a committee to investigate this case and it welcomes all information. Mr Sam Rainsy should give it any information he has.&quot;</p>
