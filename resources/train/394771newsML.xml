<p>Starbucks Corp said Friday it is confident it can sell its upscale coffee in Miami, although the city of hot sun, beaches and cool drinks is a far cry from the company's cloudy, chilly Seattle base.</p>
<p>&quot;People drink coffee everywhere,&quot; Starbucks zone vice president Marcia Adams told Reuters in an interview at the company's new store in the Miami suburb Coral Gables.</p>
<p>Adams said the company's current plan is to open 13 standalone stores in Florida, all in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties by the end of September.  </p>
<p>&quot;Florida has a very high coffee consumption rate compared to the rest of the country,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Company officials were in southern Florida Friday for the opening of its first two standalone stores in the state, both in suburbs of Miami.  A third was expected to open within days.</p>
<p>Adams would not project sales figures but said Starbucks did not anticipate problems winning an audience in Miami, although she acknowledged that the area is known best for &quot;cafe cubano,&quot; thimble-sized plastic cups of sugar-sweetened espresso brought to Florida by the Cuban-American community.  </p>
<p>&quot;We can make coffee any way anyone wants it.  If they can tell us what they want, we can make it for them,&quot; she said. She also noted the market for Cuban coffee, which sells for about $0.30 at utilitarian walkup windows, is different from the crowds drawn to Starbucks' cafe atmosphere, where an iced coffee drink can cost as much as $3.85 and an espresso $1.00.</p>
<p>The company opted not to translate its signs into Spanish -- the native tongue of an estimated 60 percent of people in the Miami area -- although about half the staff hired in the region speak the language.</p>
<p>&quot;We talked about it and we really felt we needed to come into the market as a true Starbucks,&quot; she said.  She said Starbucks had done a strong mail order business in the region even before it decided to open stores here.</p>
