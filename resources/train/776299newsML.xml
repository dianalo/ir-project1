<title>USA: Lower benefit costs best news &quot;behind us&quot;--SF Fed.</title>
<headline>Lower benefit costs best news &quot;behind us&quot;--SF Fed.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>Lower benefit costs have had a dampening effect on U.S. inflation, but the best news on that front is probably over, said the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Robert Parry.</p>
<p>&quot;The best news is perhaps behind us when it comes to those kinds of cost pressures. I think most analysts believe the biggest savings probably are behind us,&quot; Parry told reporters after a speech to the American Bar Association here.</p>
<p>Parry said earlier that companies enjoyed a deceleration of benefits costs as they shifted to managed medical care plans, which, in turn, helped keep inflation low.  </p>
<p>Parry also said he was pleasantly surprised with the performance of the U.S. economy so far in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I must admit things have turned out to be much more favorable than I thought they would be a year ago,&quot; the San Francisco Fed president said.</p>
<p>Parry said that by mid-1996 he thought that tighteness in labor and capital markets would cause inflationary pressures to begin to surface.</p>
<p>&quot;But things have turned out very different. We've had growth that is stronger than I expected, an unemployment rate lower than I expected and inflation better than I expected,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Parry said he sees the U.S. economy growing between 2.0 and 2.5 percent over the next year or longer.</p>
