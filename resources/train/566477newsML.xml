<p>This is not the O.J. case.</p>
<p>From putting drill bits and a phone card into evidence to offering up heart-wrenching testimony and painting a portrait of a man at war with his government, the prosecution in the Oklahoma City bombing case is quickly building its case.</p>
<p>Legal experts say the prosecution against 29-year-old Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh could be completed within three weeks -- much faster than expected -- if the prosecution maintains the serious, no nonsense approach it has delivered in the first two weeks of the case.</p>
<p>Their presentation is in sharp contrast to the prosecution meandering and battles with the defence that marked the O.J. Simpson double-murder case, a case that many Americans have, for good or ill, equated with how the justice system works.</p>
<p>One legal expert said the bombing case prosecution's team-like professionalism is aided by a judge who is in complete charge and who takes no nonsense from lawyers -- even to the point of barring lawyers from talking to the press and putting their spin on a day's proceedings. In stark contrast, the Simpson murder case was a never-ending media circus.</p>
<p>&quot;Federal Judge Richard Matsch, in contrast to Simpson case Judge Lance Ito, exercises complete control over the courtroom. He's really trying to keep control of the trial,&quot; said Robert Precht, director of the Office of Public Service at the University of Michigan Law School.</p>
<p>The prosecution strategy is to alternate between the dull and the dramatic -- between putting drill bits and a padlock into evidence to bringing on McVeigh's own sister to testify.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they are trying to choreograph it to make it focused and as interesting as they can. It's looking very smooth,&quot; said William Pizzi, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School and a former federal prosecutor.</p>
<p>&quot;What the prosecution is trying to do in the courtroom is keep the jurors interested. They go from dramatic to dry to dramatic,&quot; said Precht.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are building their case against McVeigh by introducing circumstantial evidence they claim proves a conspiracy to build a bomb and then plant it at the Alfred P. Murrah federal building.</p>
<p>That circumstantial evidence includes drill holes found on a padlock protecting dynamite sticks that were stolen to a pre-paid telephone calling card to fingerprints found on receipts for motel bills and a huge purchase of fertiliser that could have been used to build the bomb.</p>
<p>The prosecution has also presented some very emotional testimony from people who were working in the Murrah building on April 19, 1995 when the blast occurred, killing 168 people.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very cleverly scripted strategy,&quot; Precht said and one very much in contrast to the World Trade Centre bombing trial where the prosecution presented scientific and physical evidence before introducing the human element.</p>
<p>The first witness the prosecution presented was Lou Klaver, an attorney with the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, located across the street from the Murrah building. She played a tape of a routine board meeting on the day of the bombing. After two minutes of voices, the tape plays a huge roar, crashes and the frightened shout of &quot;Let's get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>Other victims of the bombing -- the worst civilian attack on U.S. soil -- then took the stand to tell their stories.</p>
<p>The courtroom became charged again when Lori Fortier, wife of former McVeigh friend Michael Fortier, testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution and told how McVeigh wanted to avenge the deaths of some 80 members of the Branch Davidian cult in a showdown with the government on April 19, 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;They have terrific motive evidence -- an overpowering hatred of the government,&quot; Pizzi said. It is very important for jurors to see and understand the motive for a defendant's behaviour because it gives credence to the evidence, he said.</p>
<p>The most dramatic testimony to date came from McVeigh's sister Jennifer, who testified that her brother wrote her in the weeks before the bombing that &quot;something big is going to happen&quot; and that she burned that letter on his instructions.</p>
<p>Her testimony was followed by the dull -- dozens of telephone company executives who introduced records of calls the government claims McVeigh made while planning the bombing.</p>
