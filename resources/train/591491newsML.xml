<p>After having reached new all-time lows, the 10-year cash spreads of Iberian bonds versus Bunds could widen a bit in coming days, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>They warned same profit-taking could emerge on both Spanish and Portuguese markets next week as the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Tuesday and the French election at the weekend increase uncertainty.</p>
<p>But experts remained bullish on Iberia for the longer term, saying both nations will benefit further from European monetary and economic union (EMU) convergence with further reductions in yield differentials over Germany.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the Spanish long-term spread over its German counterpart could climb a bit higher toward 90 basis points in the short run, but added that this value could fall toward 70 or 75 basis points by June.</p>
<p>At the same time, the 10-year Portuguese bond spread was seen moving with the Spanish one, narrowing by five-to-10 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me this market is not pricing in either the U.S. FOMC meeting, nor the vote in France,&quot; said Giovanni Polastri at 4CAST in London.</p>
<p>And after sharp gains this week, a consolidation was considered more than healthy, others added.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is strong, but the spread (over Bunds) at 80 basis points is offering very strong resistance. There's more risk to a wider spread than of a smaller one.&quot;</p>
<p>After a short consolidation, EMU convergence will soon push down the Iberian 10-year cash spread over Bunds.</p>
<p>&quot;It has become increasingly clear that these spreads are moving on further convergence news.. and there's no reason why Spain and Portugal should not enter (EMU from the start),&quot; said William Thornill, senior economist at Technical Data in London.</p>
<p>This week, the Spanish 10-year spread hit a record low at 80 basis points, while its Portuguese counterpart reached its nadir at 68 basis points, after European Union finance ministers on Monday applauded both Iberian convergence plans.</p>
<p>Further reductions of the inflation rate and of official rates were also boosting Iberian debt, analysts added.</p>
<p>While Spanish April CPI fell to 1.7 percent year-on-year versus 2.2 percent in March, the Portuguese one dipped to 1.8 percent versus 2.5 percent the month earlier.</p>
<p>The Bank of Portugal cut its repo rate by 30 basis points to 6.0 percent one week ago, and the Bank of Spain on Friday cut its key money market rate for the fourth time this year by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent.</p>
<p>But from now on, the downtrend in the long end of the bonos may slow, analysts added.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Spanish) 10-year spread can go lower toward 70 basis points at the beginning of June, but the movement will become slower,&quot; said Marco Pianelli, at Nomura Research in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic investors do not seem as interested in buying at yields lower than 6.5 percent. For foreigners to play the convergence could be too expensive, given the fact short term rates are still too high in comparison with German,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Although Iberian bonds shared a similar destiny at the long end, the Portuguese short end was seen better off, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Portugal has got a lot of room to cut (official rates), more than what is left to Spain,&quot; said Thornill.</p>
<p>After the Spanish central bank had cut its official rate 12 times in 17 months, economists said it has left scope for another rate cut before the summer.</p>
<p>But perhaps no more than that.</p>
<p>&quot;They could shift the next move from June to July in order to calm down the market. As if to warn people -- the trend is still down, but it is slowing,&quot; said Pianelli.</p>
<p>But in Portugal, monetary easing has not been as aggressive as it has been in Spain.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation can fall more (in Portugal) in coming months, opening up the chance to be more aggressive,&quot; Thornill added.</p>
