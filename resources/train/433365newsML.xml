<headline>Blue-chip stocks slip on fresh interest rates fears.</headline>

<p>Blue-chip stocks meandered in a narrow trading Tuesday amid a resurgence of interest rate anxieties.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 11.54 points at 7,067.85, one day after soaring 79 points to its 14th record of the year.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances by 13-9 on moderate volume of 267 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq composite index was off 2.66 points to 1,320.06.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week's worries about Federal Reserve policy have resurfaced,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany Corp.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond was off a half point, which raised its yield to 6.86 percent from Monday's close of 6.82 percent.</p>
<p>Bonds took their cue from an uptick in fourth quarter productivity and labour costs data.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said productivity rose by 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter vs. a 2.2 percent rise the previous quarter, while unit labour costs rose 2.5 percent after a 1.4 percent increase in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Most investors concluded Friday that there was no upward pressure on wages and therefore the Fed would not raise rates,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>&quot;This report has rekindled worries and said to the bond and stock markets that there is still a chance the Fed will launch its pre-emptive strike at the March 25 or May 20 meeting of the FOMC (the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Johnson said, &quot;The worry is that rising unit labour costs will lead to price increases as businesses try to preserve margins. That has traditionally been the case.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that optimism in the bond market was on the slide, and this has taken the gusto out of the stock market rally.</p>
<p>Bill Meehan, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said the stock market was bearing up adequately given the decline in bonds and the subsequent rise in the long-term yield.</p>
<p>&quot;The market continues to amaze with its ability to shrug off bond yields which are creeping higher,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meehan said that there was nervousness among bond market traders ahead of Thursday's report on February retail sales and Friday's February wholesale price report.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get through the numbers okay we could see a relief rally in the bond market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 30-stock Dow Jones index drew what strength it had primarily from International Business Machines Corp., which rose 2-7/8 to 148-7/8, Boeing Co. up 1-7/8 at 107-3/4, and Procter &amp; Gamble, which was up 1-1/4 at 126.</p>
<p>IBM, Oracle Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. said they were collaborating on setting standards for network computing.</p>
<p>The companies said the standards that result from efforts would allow software developers to build diverse programmes to connect clients and servers through corporate networks, business-to-business networks and the Internet.</p>
<p>Oracle was up 3/8 at 36-3/8 and Sun Micro rose 5/8 to 31-7/8. Netscape was down 1-3/4 at 27-7/8.</p>
