<title>USA: GFOA sends Treasury final tax simplification plan.</title>
<headline>GFOA sends Treasury final tax simplification plan.</headline>

<p>The Government Finance Officers Association on Monday sent final recommendations to the U.S. Treasury Department on how to simplify the IRS' controversial arbitrage rebate rules.</p>
<p>GFOA outlined the proposal, which would provide some issuers a &quot;safe harbor&quot; from arbitrage rebate, in an 11-page letter to Donald Lubick, acting assistant secretary for tax policy at Treasury.</p>
<p>GFOA said it hopes Treasury will include the recommendations in a package of tax simplification proposals it is expected to submit to Congress soon.</p>
<p>Currently, local governments are required to rebate to the federal government the arbitrage they earn from issuance of tax-free bonds. But issuers complain bitterly that the rebate rules are too complicated and costly for issuers and should be amended.</p>
<p>Under GFOA's proposal, an issuer of tax-exempt bonds would not be considered to have earned arbitrage for rebate purposes if it meets six conditions.</p>
<p>The issue must be a new money issue and the issuer must &quot;reasonably expect&quot; to spend 15 percent of the bond proceeds within one year and at least 95 percent within three years, GFOA said.</p>
<p>The bonds must be fixed rate, exempt from the Internal Revenue Service's state-by-state volume cap, long-term (average maturity is greater than five years); and, where there is bond-financed reserve fund, that fund must be yield-restricted, GFOA added.</p>
<p>An earlier draft of GFOA's recommended revisions said the average maturity for long-term bonds would have to be 10 years to qualify for exemption.</p>
<p>GFOA said its plan has the backing of the National League of Cities and the National Association of Counties.</p>
<p>GFOA also said Congress should consider four other simplification proposals.</p>
<p>IRS should no longer require small governments to have &quot;general taxing authority&quot; to qualify for an existing exemption from rebate, according to the association's letter.</p>
<p>Turning to another proposal, GFOA said small governments with taxing authority currently do not have to rebate if they do not expect to issue $5 million in tax-exempt debt annually.</p>
<p>Noting that the annual limit has not been increased since 1986, GFOA recommended that the limit be raised to $25 million.</p>
<p>Current law also allows banks to take an 80 percent interest deduction for bonds issued by small issuers and 501(c)(3) entities, GFOA's letter notes. But the deduction applies only where the municipality issues $10 million or less in volume annually, GFOA adds.</p>
<p>GFOA said the small issuer limit should be increased to $25 million.</p>
<p>Also under current law, states and localities must calculate rebate at least every five years, GFOA notes. But GFOA said many issuers do not have any rebatable arbitrage once construction of the project ends.</p>
<p>The group urged IRS to excuse issuers after the first five-year rebate period if certain events have occurred or are occurring at that date.</p>
<p>Examples are if all construction proceeds have been spent or if no gross proceeds have been used to fund a debt service fund with cash.</p>
