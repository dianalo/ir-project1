<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in Amsterdam on Tuesday for celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan for rebuilding post-war Europe and bi-annual talks with the European Union presidency.</p>
<p>Clinton's jet landed just before 1830 GMT at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, where he was met by Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok.  </p>
<p>Clinton took a helicopter for the short trip to The Hague to meet up with his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had arrived earlier on Tuesday. He was due later to attend a dinner given in his honour by Dutch Queen Beatrix.</p>

<p>The U.S.-EU talks, headed by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, will result in the signing of agreements on customs and controls on trade in chemicals used in narcotics and chemical weapons.</p>
<p>Clinton is due to fly to Britain on Thursday morning.</p>
