<title>USA: Fugitive surrenders after nationwide manhunt.</title>
<headline>Fugitive surrenders after nationwide manhunt.</headline>

<p>A 21-year-old man who had been the target of a nationwide manhunt has surrendered to police after telling authorities he feared for his life.</p>
<p>Police said Cheyne Kehoe used a church pastor as an intermediary and turned himself in Monday night at the county courthouse at Colville, Washington.</p>
<p>Kehoe and his brother, Chevie, 24, were the subjects of a manhunt after a videotape of the shootout, recorded by police cameras, was widely broadcast. The pair were stopped for driving with expired license plates.</p>
<p>Chevie Kehoe is still a fugitive.</p>
<p>The brothers face a 16-count indictment related to that incident in Ohio.</p>
<p>Stevens County Undersheriff Gilbert Geer said Kehoe was expected to face an extradition request by Ohio authorities.</p>
<p>The brothers are linked to the white-separatist Christian Identity movement and grew up in Colville.</p>
<p>Kehoe declined to answer reporters' questions when he surrendered at the courthouse but in a statement he read before he was taken inside he said he chose to turn himself in because he feared for his safety.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason I acted in the manner I did was due to the actions taken against men like Randy Weaver, Gordon Kahl and Bob Mathews,&quot; he said. &quot;When the government law enforcement agencies abused the individual rights of these men, I feared for my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Weaver, a white separatist, was involved in an FBI standoff in 1992 at his remote cabin in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. His son and wife were killed along with a federal marshal.</p>
<p>Kahl, a militant tax protester, got into a gun battle that killed two U.S. marshals in North Dakota in 1983. He was killed later that year in a shootout with police in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Mathews died in a 1984 fire that followed an exchange of gunfire with the FBI on Whidbey Island, Washington.</p>
