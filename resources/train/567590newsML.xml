<p>A senior Austrian official said on Wednesday rigorous adherence to the entry criteria for Europe's single currency should be secondary to employment and growth, opening a crack in the strict interpretation of EMU standards.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer, secretary of state in the finance ministry, told the daily Wirtschaftsblatt in an interview: &quot;One has to keep an eye on employment and economic development. That has to take precedence to strict adherence to the three percent (deficit) limit as early as in 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>A government spokesman told Reuters the interview was &quot;slightly misleading&quot; and that Ruttenstorfer had in no way wanted to imply that Austria should relax its efforts to be among the first wave of nations to join EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;The convergence criteria for 1997 are beyond debate, and Austria will meet these criteria,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;What he (Ruttenstorfer) meant was the period after 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokesman added he was unable to clarify whether the secretary of state's remarks referred only to Austria or to other EMU candidates as well.</p>
<p>The Maastricht treaty on European monetary union (EMU) stipulates a range of economic targets for countries wanting to join EMU, including limiting budget deficits to a target three percent of gross domestic product and public debt to 60 percent.</p>
<p>Ruttenstorfer, who is in charge of Austria's preparations for EMU, said the speed with which countries attempted to meet these criteria should be reduced.</p>
<p>EMU participants will be selected in spring 1998 on the basis of their 1997 economic performance.</p>
<p>Economic experts and the European Union agree that Austria is set to meet the three percent deficit critieria this year, even though its debt ratio is expected to overshoot the 60 percent threshold by up to nine percent.</p>
<p>According to a recent poll, one in two Austrians is against the single currency. Austria's labour unions are not strictly against the project but have pressed the government to place more weight on employment issues in the run-up to EMU.</p>
<p>The debate about strict interpretation of the criteria has gathered pace over the past few months amid fears that Germany may miss the three percent mark this year, fuelling speculation about a possible delay of EMU.</p>
