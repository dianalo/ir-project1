<title>GERMANY: German on trial for faking TV documentaries.</title>
<headline>German on trial for faking TV documentaries.</headline>
<dateline>KOBLENZ, Germany 1996-09-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>A German television journalist went on trial on Monday charged with fraud for selling bogus documentaries featuring staged racist gatherings, drug smuggling operations and bomb makers.</p>
<p>Michael Born, 37, was charged with selling 32 fraudulent documentaries to German and Swiss television networks.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty but said network executives aired his films knowing some segments were not authentic.</p>
<p>Brutal competition for ratings in Germany's rapidly growing television market, the world's second richest behind the United States, has led to many magazine-style TV programmes pulling out all the stops to obtain dramatic film footage.</p>
<p>Saying he was fulfilling network orders to provide exclusive film, Born delivered staged scenes of such things as German Ku Klux Klan meetings, Kurdish bomb-makers and drug smugglers crossing the border into Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;The concrete demand is: they want film of something that is happening out there somewhere in the world, but for which film is not available,&quot; said Born.</p>
<p>&quot;They say &quot;you bring us pictures of these things that no one else has and no one else can possibly have',&quot; he added in an interview with German television. &quot;You make the impossible possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Born, who has been held in investigative custody since January, has been charged with selling 32 forged film reports for a total of 350,000 marks ($231,400).</p>
<p>The bogus material appeared in the early 1990s in many of Germany's best-known magazine-style news broadcasts, such as Stern TV on private network RTL, Spiegel TV on Vox and ZAK on public broadcaster ARD.</p>
<p>Born told the court on Monday he hired friends as actors for a film about drugs being smuggled into Germany through the Alps from Austria.</p>
<p>He also admitted that he had himself played a part in one film report about refugees being smuggled into Germany from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Norbert Weise said he had so far found no evidence that executives at the TV stations knew the films were partly faked, but added it could not be ruled out that some station employees were aware of the scheme.</p>
