<p>Sri Lanka will enact new laws under the country's emergency regulations to crack down on illegal firearms, Justice Minister Gamini Lakshman Peiris said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Today in Sri Lanka there is a very strong consensus in favour of tougher legislation to deal with illegal firearms,&quot; Peiris told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The existing laws are inadequate and we need tougher laws to control the indiscriminate use of firearms today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new laws, expected to be finalised within three weeks, provide for a minimum seven-year prison sentence and a maximum of 20 years for possession of unlicenced guns and other firearms, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;When an unlicenced firearm is found in the house or the vehicle of a person, there will be a presumption that the person concerned had knowledge of the existence of the firearms at that particular place,&quot; Peiris said.</p>
<p>The law will also pave the way for the confiscation of the vehicle or house where illegal firearms are found and those charged will not be entitled to bail until the judicial process is completed, Peiris said.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean island's gun culture became a key public issue after a young ruling People's Alliance coalition legislator was gunned down last month.</p>
<p>A member of parliament of the main opposition United National Party (UNP) and a former UNP mayor are among the suspects detained by police over the killing.</p>
<p>Politicians and political activists in Sri Lanka carry guns, many of them unlicenced, to guard against attack by separatist Tamil rebels who are fighting for independence in the island's north and east.</p>
<p>The government has extended until March 15 an amnesty for the surrender of illegal weapons.</p>
<p>Peiris said the new laws would be enacted under emergency regulations as a temporary measure.</p>
<p>&quot;Enacting them under the normal law is going to take a lot of time. But with this, there is a sense of emergency,&quot; he said.</p>
