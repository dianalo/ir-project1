<p>Asian gasoline prices are set to fall amid dwindling buying interest and growing supplies, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Gasoline prices are toppish,&quot; said a Japanese trader, an active buyer of gasoline, referring to the high price levels. &quot;The market has been very quiet ... we have not been buying.&quot;</p>
<p>Prices for 95-octane unleaded gasoline on the benchmark Singapore market are above $25.00 per barrel after rising more than $3.50 since the end of August.</p>
<p>But traders said the price hike has been supported by the dramatic rally in crude oil and did not reflect strong demand for gasoline.</p>
<p>Traders said limited supplies should support gasoline over the short term.</p>
<p>Exporter Thailand has already placed its November gasoline cargoes, China only has one cargo left for sale and buyers such as Taiwan and South Korea have already covered most of their November needs.</p>
<p>In the absence of a continued rally in crude prices, however, traders said traditional Asian demand for gasoline will not be enough to sustain current prices through year-end.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look into the slightly longer time frame, I don't think prices can stand,&quot; said one trader, referring to the end of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices got a good push in September and October, but for cargoes from the second half of November and December, fundamentals will come back to bring prices down,&quot; said a trader with a major oil company.</p>
<p>Growing Asian gasoline supplies, particularly from new refineries in Thailand and South Korea, have plagued the market since the middle of the year.</p>
<p>Some relief emerged in August and September as cargoes sold sold to Africa but that outlet has since disappeared because western prices are more attractive for African buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>Thailand, which exports around 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, has yet to sell its December gasoline and there are growing worries about supplies from Singapore and China hitting the market.</p>
<p>In Singapore, light distillate stocks (gasoline, reformate and naphtha) rose in the week to October 23 to 6.092 million barrels, up 685,000 barrels from the week before.</p>
<p>Prices for naphtha, a blendstock in gasoline production, are expected to come under pressure along with gasoline.</p>
<p>Naphtha is currently priced at $2.75 below a barrel of gasoline. But naphtha's premium is expected to drop to less than $2.00 by the end of the fourth-quarter of 1996 as gasoline weakens.</p>
<p>But despite the expected downturn in gasoline prices, analysts said they did not expect Asian motorists will see cheaper prices at the pump soon.</p>
<p>They said a price trend in international markets has to be sustained for several months before retail prices are changed.</p>
