<p>Japanese government bonds (JGBs) surged to end Tokyo trade sharply higher on Tuesday as sentiment got a boost from a better-than-expected result in the auction of 10-year bonds earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The lowest price for the 197th 2.6 percent 10-year bond was 100.20 instead of 100.15 or even 100.10, as some in the market had feared prior to the auction.</p>
<p>This provided a positive tone and relieved the market, which had forecast lukewarm results due to the release of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) tankan survey on Wednesday. The September futures contract ended at 124.41, up 0.50 from Monday Tokyo.  </p>
<p>The bond ranged from 124.01 to 124.41, with turnover of 39,597 contracts.</p>
<p>Yield on the key 182nd 10-year cash bond stood at 2.340 percent at 0631 GMT against 2.390 at Monday's Tokyo close.</p>
<p>&quot;Many in the market had been expecting rather poor results in the auction, at least partly because they felt that few operators would be eager to buy ahead of the tankan,&quot; one trader with a city bank's securities arm said.</p>
<p>Although bonds had been firm for much of the day on rumours that the tankan will be poor, they surged after the auction when the results prompted short-covering, he added.  </p>
<p>But other dealers saw a different cause for the rise, with some saying that a number of operators may have been unable to buy in the auction because they placed their bids too low, prompting them to buy JGBs after the auction results came out.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the market was expecting a lower average bid, it seems a number of operators may have found themselves unable to buy, and that they then turned to buying futures,&quot; a credit bank dealer said.</p>
<p>In any case, sentiment was given a positive pre-tankan tone, with some dealers saying that even a stronger-than-expected tankan may not hit bonds too hard.  </p>
<p>One dealer with a major city bank's securities arm said that the market appears to have confirmed the solidity of the downside at the upper end of the 123-124 level, reducing the chance of a plunge, even should the tankan, which will be released at 0850 JST Wednesday (2350 GMT), come in strong.</p>
<p>JGBs got a boost as high as 124.30 in morning trade from a number of tankan rumours, including talk that a senior BOJ official had suggested in a closed meeting with some Japanese bank directors on Monday that the tankan results would be weak.</p>
<p>Many in the market appear to believe that the diffusion index (DI) for major manufacturers will come in around zero.  </p>
<p>JGBs got an additional boost in morning trade from rumours that JP Morgan, which had previously made an optimistic forecast for the tankan, had revised it downward.</p>
<p>But JP Morgan's chief economist in Tokyo, Jesper Koll, told Reuters he had not revised the original forecast of plus four for the key major manufacturers' diffusion index (DI).</p>
<p>A dealer with a city bank's securities arm said the topside for JGBs was likely to hold at a bit above 124.40 overnight, but that further moves would depend on the tankan results.</p>
