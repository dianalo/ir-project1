<p>The 1998 target date to start mining at the Voisey's Bay metals deposit, one of the world's biggest nickel deposit, will be a &quot;tight&quot; deadline to meet, says the new president of Inco Ltd.'s Voisey's Bay Nickel Co.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still looking at that (time frame) very carefully,&quot; Stewart Gendron said in an interview recently. &quot;It's pretty tight.&quot;</p>
<p>Inco intends to produce 270 million pounds of nickel annually, as well as 200 million pounds of copper and a significant amount of cobalt at the site in Canada's remote northeastern region of Labrador.</p>
<p>The company has forecasted initial production of 23 million pounds of nickel and 15 million pounds of copper in 1998.</p>
<p>Inco's plans to take over the deposit were delayed for three months this summer after the completion of its C$4.3 billion ($3.1 billion) acquisition of Diamond Fields Resources was put on hold while Diamond Fields executives settled a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Voisey's Bay has cemented Inco's position as the western world's largest nickel producer.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate that it will give Inco control 38 percent of the world's nickel market.</p>
<p>Gendron, 53, has been president for three weeks. He left his position as vice-president of milling, smelting and refining at Inco's Copper Cliff complex near Sudbury, Ontario, when the Voisey's Bay takeover was completed in August.</p>
<p>He and his team are now involved in environmental issues and negotiations with local aboriginals.</p>
<p>Without land claims agreements, the aboriginal groups have the power to delay or even prevent mining in the area, Inco has told its shareholders.</p>
<p>Gendron said the company also planned to finish a feasibility study for the remote Labrador site in the province of Newfoundland before the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our primary focus right at the moment is environmental permitting,&quot; Gendron said.</p>
<p>His negotiators are mired in a tangle of overlapping provincial and federal regulations that they hoped to simplify for their project.</p>
<p>&quot;My view is both the provincial government and the federal government are committed to making this happen,&quot; he said. &quot;We clearly want to have production as soon as possible. Their objective would be the same.&quot;</p>
<p>But negotiations with two local aboriginal groups could be complicated, since there are four sets of negotiations.</p>
<p>The two groups, the Innu and the Inuit, are set to launch a lengthy round of negotiations with the federal and provincial governments over land claims.</p>
<p>Gendron said he expected an agreement by March.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the things that seems frightening to the aboriginal groups is their perception that this is really a gigantic project and that the time schedule is very tight,&quot; Gendron said.</p>
<p>&quot;But as a mine goes, while this is a good size mine, it remains simply just a mine and just a mill. The physical imprint on the land is much larger in people's perceptions than in reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Although making a 1998 schedule for open pit production may be challenging, the company's plans for full production by the year 2000 are on track, Gendron said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've talked full refinery operation by the year 2000 and we're still working toward that target.&quot;</p>
<p>The company intends to start construction on an underground mine, a mill, a refinery and a smelter at the same time. The project will cost about C$1.1 billion ($802 million), Inco has estimated.</p>
<p>&quot;By the year 2000, we expect to have all four parts in operation,&quot; Gendron said.</p>
