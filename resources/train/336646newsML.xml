<p>Walt Disney Co on Tuesday said it planned to explore options related to the publishing operations of Capital Cities/ABC, including a possible sale of the business.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said the assets, which include a variety of newspapers and industry publications such as Women's Wear Daily, Automotive Marketing and Institutional Investor, could fetch as much as $2.5 billion.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for Disney said the entertainment giant has received interest from a variety of companies looking to build up their publishing operations, but he declined to be specific. Among the options under consideration by Disney are a swap for other assets or a possible spin-off.</p>
<p>Cruttendon, Roth analyst Jeff Logsdon said the operations, which generate between $240 million and $250 million a year in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amoritization, could fetch as much as $2.5 billion in an auction, leaving Disney to focus its resources on other areas.  </p>
<p>&quot;From Disney's standpoint, I think there are very little obvious synergistic benefits to these assets,&quot; Logsdon said. He said it was unlikely that Women's Wear Daily or Institutional Investor could fit into a strategy of exploiting the Mickey Mouse brand around the world.</p>
<p>Earlier, Disney said it and Comcast Corp agreed to acquire Time Warner Inc's stake in the cable channel E! Entertainment Television. Analysts estimated Disney's investment at about $320 million.</p>
<p>Jessica Reif, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the move was a cheap way for Disney to acquire another cable channel at a time when access to subscribers has been commanding hefty premiums.</p>
<p>&quot;They're paying roughly $12 to $13 per subscriber,&quot; she said. &quot;New networks are offering more than that just to get on -- and this is a profitable network.&quot;</p>
<p>The Capital Cities/ABC publishing operations are part of the company's Creative Content segment. The unit is involved in printing and distribution of daily and weekly newspapers, specialized industry publications and a range of consumer and special-interest publications.</p>
