<text>
<p>New Zealand's Labour Party was on Wednesday finalising a definitive coalition proposal document to pass to the nationalist New Zealand First Party, a Labour spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said &quot;The Document&quot; was being drafted on Wednesday morning to be passed to NZ First for its consideration, after which a meeting between Labour and NZ First negotiators would probably be scheduled.</p>
<p>NZ First is also in coalition talks with the caretaker National Party government.  </p>
<p>The Labour spokesman could not confirm whether the document had already been handed over to NZ First.</p>
<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Jim Bolger declined comment on the state of coalition negotiations as he entered a meeting of National's parliamentary caucus.</p>
<p>National and Labour have both been negotiating to form a government with NZ First since an inconclusive general election on October 12. Parliament is due to convene for the first time by December 13. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746</p>
