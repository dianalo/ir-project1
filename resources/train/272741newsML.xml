<headline>LIFFE white sugar off highs, trade buying supports.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-23</dateline>

<p>LIFFE white sugar futures failed to build on their earlier gains on Monday but light trade buying kept most values supported above the lows in a rangebound session, traders said.</p>
<p>The bulk of the volume derived from the spot March contract but much of this was crossed and against actuals trades.</p>
<p>Commission buying of March pushed the spot value up to a high of $307.50 earlier on, which then sparked broker buying in the further fowards.</p>
<p>At 1700 GMT March stood $1.40 higher at $306.50 and May up $1.30 at $306.40. Other forward months were slightly firmer.</p>
<p>Volume amounted to 1,209 lots but activity was generally light as players on the London market prepared for the extended holiday break. In physical news, Turkey has agreed with Iran to sell it 50,000 tonnes of sugar from its stocks with the possibility of more exports at a later date.</p>
<p>Turkey has also offered to sell Iraq 50,000 tonnes of sugar under a U.N. oil-for-food deal which allows Iraq to sell oil worth $2 billion over six months to buy food and medicine.</p>
<p>On the freight market, two orders emerged quoting Iraq as an optional destination for Brazilian bagged sugar cargoes. Czarnikow Rionda quoted for 14,000 tonnes from south Brazil to Aqaba or Iraq's Gulf port of Umm Qasr and Genoc was open for a same-sized cargo from north Brazil to Mediterrean, Red Sea, Umm Qasr, Pakistan or Colombo. Paris trading was little changed from the morning with just 140 lots on the board. March was up $1.10 at $306.60 and May up 90 cents at $306.40.</p>
