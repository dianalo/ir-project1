<title>MOZAMBIQUE: Mozambique rail privatisation moves ahead.</title>

<p>Privatisation of Mozambique's railway lines took a step forward this week with an announcement that a study on leasing out the railway lines of southern Mozambique to private management had been completed.</p>
<p>Miguel Matabele, a member of the management board of the publicly-owned ports and rail company, CFM, told reporters in Maputo that new joint ventures between CFM and private companies, Mozambican and foreign, would be set up to run the railways.</p>
<p>Matabele was on the sidelines of a meeting with investors discussing the Maputo Development Corridor, a major programme aimed at intensifying economic and trade links between Johannesburg and the port of Maputo.</p>
<p>The railways up for privatisation are the lines from Maputo to Swaziland, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The Maputo railway workshops and marshalling yards will also be leased out to private management.</p>
<p>Matabele stressed, however, that the track and other physical infrastructure will remain the property of CFM.</p>
<p>The announcement comes in the wake of the death of the chairman of CFM's board, Mario Dimande, one of southern Africa's most respected port and railway specialists.</p>
<p>Dimande collapsed and died aboard a Portuguese airliner as it was approaching Johannesburg airport from Lisbon, where he had been on holiday.</p>
<p>Dimande was one of the architects of the CFM privatisation process. Unofficial reports say he suffered a heart attack on the TAP plane.</p>
