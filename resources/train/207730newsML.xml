<headline>CS First Boston failed to disclose risks - SEC.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission sued CS First Boston Corp on Wednesday for fraud in the sale of $110 million of Series B pension obligation bonds issued by Orange County in September 1994.</p>
<p>CS First Boston, a unit of CS Holding, was the senior underwriter of the pension bonds. The SEC said the official statement for the bonds misrepresented and omitted several material facts about the county's investments.</p>
<p>The SEC said the firm knew or was &quot;reckless in not knowing&quot; that:</p>
<p>* Orange County's investment strategy was premised on the assumption that interest rates would remain relatively low for at least three years.</p>
<p>* The county investment pools employed a high degree of leverage through reverse repurchase agreements, which magnified the risk of loss when interest rates rose.</p>
<p>* The county invested heavily in certain derivative securities that reacted negatively to a rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>* The maturities of the reverse repurchase agreements were not matched with the maturities of the securities purchased with the proceeds of those agreements, which exposed the county investment pools to risk.</p>
<p>* As a result of rising interest rates in 1994, the county investment pools suffered significant market losses and collateral calls.</p>
<p>* Critics had charged that the county's investment strategy was too risky for public funds.</p>
