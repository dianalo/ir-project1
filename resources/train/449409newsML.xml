<p>The popularity gap between Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) and the main opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) narrowed sharply in March, an opinion poll published on Tuesday showed.</p>
<p>In the early March survey by the private STEM agency, 27.1 percent of respondents said they would vote ODS if an election were held next week compared with 25.2 percent for CSSD giving ODS a 1.9 percent lead down from 4.7 percent in February.</p>
<p>The STEM poll contradicted a survey by the state-funded agency IVVM which showed on Monday that a long-term tightening in support for the two parties had reversed with the ODS pulling away from its main rivals.</p>
<p>Analysts are watching the surveys closely to guage whether Klaus's conservative minority government or the opposition might jump on any trend away from the status quo to push for fresh elections after an inconclusive elections last June.</p>
<p>But Czech opinion polls are often inconsistent. The IVVM poll published on Monday said that ODS's lead over CSSD had more than doubled in March to seven percentage points.</p>
<p>Tuesday's STEM poll suggested that there is still no major change in public opinion from las June's vote. The next general elections are scheduled for June 2000.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Social Democrats will take heart from Tuesday's poll in which deputy chairwoman Petra Buzkova was rated the most popular politician for the second month in a row and CSSD leader Milos Zeman's regained his lead over Klaus.</p>
<p>Overall, support for the three-party pro-business coalition government was virtually unchanged from February on 46.8 percent compared with 47 percent.</p>
<p>The centrist junior coalition party, the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), remained third most popuolar with 11.1 percent and the Civic Democratioc Alliance (ODA) was in fifth place with 8.6 percent.</p>
<p>Support for the Communists (KSCM) declined to nine percent from 10.6 percent in February and the far-right Republicans, whose leader Miroslav Sladek was indicted on criminal charges last month for inciting racial hatred (SPR-RSC) at an anti-German rally, were unchanged on 5.4 percent.</p>
<p>The coalition lost its parliamentary majority in last June's elections, gaining 99 seats in the 200-seat chamber, but remained in power as the Social Democrats ruled out a grand coalition with the communists and Republicans.</p>
<p>In the June vote, ODS received 29.6 percent, the CSSD 26.44 percent, KSCM 10.33 percent, KDU-CSL 8.08 percent, ODA 6.36 percent and SPR-RSC 8.01 percent.</p>
<p>Around 54 percent of respondents said they would definitley turn out to vote if an election were held next week down four percentage points from last month's survey.</p>
