<p>Municipalities in North Carolina and Virginia should see no credit impact from Hurricane Fran because their underlying economies are strong and they will receive substantial state and federal disaster aid, Moody's Investors Service said Monday.</p>
<p>The hurricane swept through eastern North Carolina and southwest and central Virgina Sept 5 and 6, causing widespread damge that is expected to total in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>However, the rating agency said, &quot;The approximately 100 debt ratings of municipalities in the affected states are not expected to be significantly impacted.&quot;</p>
<p>Hardest hit were Wilmington, Wrightsville Beach, New Hanover County, Raleigh and Wake County in North Cartolina, and in Virginia, Danville and communities in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>Moody's said its ratings in the region are mainly general obligation and essential purpose revenue bonds, and certificates of participation backed by absolute and unconditional pledges to pay debt service.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the affected municipalities have established economic bases, which are expected to recover in a reasonable period from the storm's short-term disruption,&quot; Moody's said. &quot;Most communties maintain good finances and liquidity and therefore can support extraordinary expenses.&quot;</p>
<p>The rating agency said general revenues are comprised mainly of property taxes and state aid, which should not be significantly affected by the storm.</p>
<p>&quot;Losses from decreases to collected sales taxes and other economically sensitive revenue sources, which comprise a relatively small share of revenues, are likely to be temporary, and support for essential purpose revenue bonds also should not be materially affected,&quot; Moody's said.</p>
<p>Additionally, the rating agency said, large portions of the two states have been declared federal disaster areas, entitling them to Federal Emergency Management Administration money.</p>
<p>Most property damage from wind and fallen trees is expected to be covered by private insurance, while businesses and residents who were not fully insured will be able to seek federal low-interest loans.</p>
<p>State emergency preparedness officials are already coordinating with federal officials to facilitate that funding, Moody's said.</p>
