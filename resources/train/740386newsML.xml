<headline>UK money supply growth hits seven-year high.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-18</dateline>

<p>Britain's broad money supply measure climbed to its highest level since December 1990 in June, the Bank of England said on Friday.</p>
<p>M4, the broad measure of money supply, grew by 11.6 percent in the year to June, fuelling fears that high street spending is out of control.  </p>
<p>But a modest 5.5 billion pounds ($9.2 billion) in adjusted lending by banks and building societies suggested the headline figure may be painting an overblown picture of consumer demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Breakdown of the M4 data is much less frightening than the unexpectedly strong headline growth rate,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica.</p>
<p>&quot;In particular, the key lending counterpart rose a relatively modest 5.5 billion. This does not suggest that the consumer sector is slowing, but at least it should help to ease some worries that spending is about to run away with itself.&quot;</p>
<p>Figures released by the British Bankers' Association at the same time as the money statistics showed healthy bank lending in June and a 905 million stg increase in mortgage lending -- the largest rise in four years.</p>
<p>The Building Societies Association said net new mortgage approvals in June continued their moderate increase.($ = 0.598 British Pounds)</p>
