<headline>INSIGHT - BTPs recover nerve, eye gains to 138.19.</headline>

<text>
<p>September BTP futures recovered their poise with a break above 137.80 at the open on Wednesday, suggesting further gains to 138.19, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>The LIFFE contract struggled to pierce 137.80 in the past two sessions, setting a high there coinciding with the 137.85 Fibonacci target based on Tuesday afternoon's setback.</p>
<p>Nicholas Rose, technical analyst at 4CAST in London, said a rise above 137.65 in Tuesday's session had improved the tone.</p>
<p>&quot;A firm open and an early rise to 137.80 could well see 138.19 taken out on the day,&quot; Rose said.</p>
<p>By 0740 GMT, September BTP futures stood 0.49 up at 137.94.  </p>
<p>Analysts at Chase in London expected the BTP to break impulsively higher suggesting a move to 139.08 -- upper boundary of an ascending trend channel intervening on the weekly chart.</p>
<p>Corrections at this stage should be minor, but a weekly close above 139.08 was needed to open the potential to 139.64 and then 140.73, Chase analysts said in a note to clients.</p>
<p>The technical outlook would change, however, if major support at around 137.30 gave way, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;That would certainly flatten the pattern,&quot; said Rose. He saw initial support at 137.56, the close on July 22 when the market spiked higher from a brief correction phase.  </p>
<p>Chase analysts meanwhile saw Elliott support at 137.32 and additional trendline support at 137.38.</p>
<p>&quot;A break of 137.32 puts the BTP under serious pressure, identifying the rally from 137.15 (on Tuesday) as a three-wave sub-structured correction, calling for a test of the key 136.75 Elliott support,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>Analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell pegged resistance at 138.14. Clearing this would target a retest of the contract high of 138.44. But with weekly indicators already overstretched, objectives near 139.80 should be viewed with caution. At the short end, September eurolira futures were 0.01 up at 93.29.</p>
