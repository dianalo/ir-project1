<p>John Major, sounding as though he has already prepared his excuses for a defeat at the coming election, has admitted for the first time that Britain's entry into Europe's currency grid was a &quot;political mistake&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Events made a monkey of us,&quot; the prime minister said of Britain's humiliating ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in September 1992.</p>
<p>Interviewed on Wednesday by BBC television, Major implicitly endorsed the view held by many members of his Conservative party that the ERM debacle, by making ministers look incompetent, was at the root of the government's current unpopularity.</p>
<p>Major described the pound sterling's forced exit from the currency grid, the precursor of the European single currency planned for launch in 1999, as &quot;the biggest blot on what subsequently happened in the eyes of the public&quot;.</p>
<p>The prime minister said he was prepared to apologise for the matter as long as he could also take credit for the fact that the discipline of joining the ERM in October 1990 had helped give Britain its lowest inflation rate in generations.</p>
<p>&quot;Going into the ERM is seen by many people as a mistake. That is certainly true, politically it can certainly be said to have been a mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;But economically, if we had not gone into the ERM, I very much doubt we would have killed inflation as comprehensively as we had,&quot; Major said. &quot;But we came out of it in ignominious circumstances and that was a political mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>The main opposition Labour party said Major should not be surprised that voters have refused to give his government credit for the economic recovery ushered in by sterling's exit from the ERM, which allowed interest rates to come down sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a bit late for reluctant death-bed apologies,&quot; Brian Wilson, Labour's campaign spokesman, said.</p>
<p>&quot;The limited recovery which has taken place since the depths of Black Wednesday is, by definition, in spite of the government rather than because of it, since their exit was certainly involuntary,&quot; Wilson added.</p>
<p>Major's frank admission comes against a backdrop of opinion polls pointing to a clear victory for Labour at the election, widely expected on May 1.</p>
<p>Voter surveys give Labour, in opposition since 1979, a lead approaching 20 percentage points -- in line with the 17 percent swing it enjoyed in a by-election last Thursday to capture a hitherto safe Conservative seat in northwest England.</p>
<p>Some political commentators, wondering whether Major has seen the writing on the wall, have sensed an elegaic tone in some of his recent remarks.</p>
<p>But in his BBC interview, Major said the Conservatives could come back from behind -- as they did at the 1992 election -- to win an unprecedented fifth consecutive term.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe opinion will change and I believe I will win,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not complacent about that. There's a huge amount to be done. But I certainly believe we can win this election.&quot;</p>
<p>In light of Labour leader Tony Blair's repeated warnings against complacency, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, Robin Cook, raised eyebrows by looking ahead to a repeat of Labour's landslide at the 1945 general election.</p>
<p>Speaking at a party marking the 60th anniversary of the left-wing Tribune newspaper, Cook said on Wednesday: &quot;What better year could we have to celebrate the 60th anniversary in which we are going to see the second Labour landslide of this century?&quot;</p>
