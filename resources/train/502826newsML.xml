<p>In a market jittery over Intel Corp's quarterly earnings announcement due Monday, investors dumped the stock for a third straight session and abandoned most other semiconductor issues, traders said.</p>
<p>In Nasdaq trade, Intel fell 4-1/4, or 3.1 percent to 133 in heavy trade, extending a two-day falloff from 145-1/4.</p>
<p>The negative sentiment was thickened by speculation that Intel will maker deeper-than-usual price cuts in its Pentium chips, the traders added.  </p>
<p>Intel said it intends to lower prices by the end of April, but declined to say by how much.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Philadeplphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index was off 5.2 points, or 1.8 percent, to 274.5.</p>
<p>Traders said Intel investors are fretting over the pervasiveness of a so-called &quot;whisper number&quot; that raises the expectations for Intel's first quarter income.</p>
<p>The formal expectation is an analysts' consensus view of $2.05 per share, according to Zack's Investment Research, while the whisper number is roughly $0.10 to $0.15 above that, traders said.  </p>
<p>Among the semiconductor index, Xilinx Inc was the sole gainer among 16 components with a 3/4 rise to 47-5/8.</p>
<p>In addition to Intel, big losers among the group included Advanced Micro Devices Inc, off 1-1/2 to 38-1/4, VLSI Technology Inc down one to 17-3/4, Teradyne Inc off one to 32, Motorola down 1-1/4 at 58-1/2 and Texas Instruments Inc was 1-3/8 lower at 81-1/4.  </p>
<p>An exception among the weaker chip stocks was Dallas Semiconductor Corp, which rallied 5-1/2 to 32, a 20 percent gain, after the company reported first quarter earnings last night well above Wall Street expectations.</p>
<p>The company said it earned $0.50 per share in the period ended March 30, up from $0.36 one year ago and $0.10 better than the Zack's consensus forecast.</p>
<p>Computer networking shares were also heavily sold Friday, in activity that was driven by a series earnings of reports released after last night's market close.  </p>
<p>Ascend Communications Inc and Cascade Communications Corp, which agreed to merge last month in a stock-swap deal that was then valued at $3.7 billion, both announced quarterly results.</p>
<p>While Ascend, the buyer of Cascade, reported operating earnings of $0.36 per share, $0.03 above the Wall Street consensus, Cascade disappointed with below-expectation results.</p>
<p>In Nasdaq trade, Cascade shares were off three to 27-3/8 and Ascend declined 3-1/8 to 43-1/4.</p>
<p>Other netorking issues also fell: Cisco Systems dropped 1-1/2 to 51-1/8, DSC Communications shed 1/4 to 20-1/4 and U.S. Robotics lost 3/4 to 54-7/8.</p>
