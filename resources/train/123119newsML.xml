<p>Russian financial markets, already hit by a flare-up in political infighting, are likely to be further unsettled after President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday sacked national security chief Alexander Lebed, analysts said.</p>
<p>Some market players said Yeltsin's show of strength -- announcing the sacking on television and signing the decree as he spoke -- could drive prices higher but added that the direction of the market would depend on how Lebed reacted.</p>
<p>&quot;Markets in London seem to accept this as decent news because Yeltsin has finally shown up and settled this thing,&quot; said Alliance-Menatep head trader Nick Mokhoff, but added that given Lebed's support among Russia's military, his removal was not all positive.</p>
<p>&quot;At this level and with this uncertainty, I would not be long in this market. We still have to see how Lebed is going to react to this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Most leading Russians shares fell on Thursday after Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov's allegation on Wednesday that Lebed was plotting a creeping coup unnerved investors. The RTS index of 24 leading stocks fell 2.50 percent to 177.81.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who is preparing for heart surgery, went on television to announce he was sacking Lebed just after markets in Moscow officially closed.</p>
<p>But Russia's dollar-denominated Vneshekonombank debt, which opened at a low of 74, recovered to around 75 by 1545 GMT.</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Jim Nail said one view was that Lebed's sacking removed more of the damaging uncertainty.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;My view is that it is bad because it reduces the consensus supporting the current government and eliminates the government's most popular member and risks a renewed flare-up of the Chechen conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be selling now if I were a trader.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian shares soared in the run-up to Yeltsin's victory in a July presidential election which seemed to put an end to uncertainty. Stocks initially slumped when Yeltsin's health problems became apparent soon after the poll but have made up much lost ground.</p>
<p>At the same time, investors have been encouraged by a string of positive developments.</p>
<p>Russia won a higher than expected rating for its anticipated debut Eurobond, investors are keen on a planned international issue by gas monopoly Gazprom and the International Finance Corporation has launched a daily Russia index.</p>
<p>Inflation is under control and, despite fiscal worries, the International Monetary Fund has praised Russian economic reform.</p>
<p>Analysts expect significant, if gradual, new investment in Russian securities in coming months.</p>
<p>Yeltsin brought Lebed into the Kremlin team to boost his chances in the presidential poll after the gruff general came third in the first round.</p>
<p>Lebed negotiated a peace accord in rebel Chechnya but it has met strong opposition in Moscow.</p>
<p>But Robert Devane, head of fixed income at Troika-Dialog, said markets -- which have been shaky since Yeltsin's health problems became apparent soon after the election -- would focus on his decisive action.</p>
<p>&quot;What we just saw was the most significant show of Yeltsin's presence in the last couple of months. We actually saw him speak today on today's issues and sign today's decree,&quot; he said.</p>
