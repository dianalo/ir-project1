<p>Speculation could still put more pressure on the gold price in the near future but physical demand will continue to offer support, Bobby Godsell, chairman of Anglo American Corp of South Africa's gold division, said on Monday.</p>
<p>Gold producers could look forward to stronger prices in the future, he said in his annual reviews for the Anglogold mines.</p>
<p>&quot;The price will continue to be supported on the downside by worldwide physical demand and we look forward to stronger prices in the future as the economic cycle changes,&quot; Godsell said.</p>
<p>&quot;Whilst speculative sentiment may continue to keep the price at the lower end of this range ($330 to $390) for some months ahead, there is no reason to believe that gold will cease to be both a desired store of value and adornment for hundreds of millions of individuals throughout the world,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The bullion price is still trapped in the middle of a slump that has seen gold mining shares track downwards over the last few months. The price of the yellow metal was last at $346.95/347.45 an ounce.</p>
<p>Godsell said that gold was also a store of value for nations and institutions and that &quot;prudence&quot; would dictate that they continue to hold some proportion of wealth as gold.</p>
<p>While physical demand for gold was growing in most developing markets, gold demand in developed markets was causing concern, Godsell said.</p>
<p>He said the &quot;static&quot; resources of the World Gold Council (WGC) had required it to reduce spending in developed markets consistently over six years in order to fund programmes in the underdeveloped markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Additional funds are unlikely to be forthcoming from existing WGC member companies. What is required is the recruitment of new membership from that considerable portion of gold producers who are not currently members of the WGC.&quot;</p>
<p>While the issue of central bank gold sales had clearly affected investor sentiment in bullion negatively, the issue was a phase in a long continuum of the liberalisation of the gold market since the 1960s, Godsell said.</p>
<p>Anglogold's stable of mines includes Elandsrand Gold Mining Co Ltd, Western Deep Levels Ltd, Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Co Ltd and Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd.</p>
