<p>New forms of money transmission are being developed but banks remain at the heart of payment systems and central bank liquidity help should, on the whole, be limited to them, Bank of England governor Eddie George said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be very cautious about extending last resort liquidity provision to financial institutions not engaged in &quot;banking' activity, and where the particular justification for it, based upon banks' distinctive functions...did not clearly apply,&quot; George told an IMF banking seminar in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;While I do not think that such intervention can, realistically, be excluded altogether, I am concerned that an unduly liberal interpretation of systemic risk would... ultimately weaken the safety and soundness of the financial sytem as a whole,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Banks were likely to remain at the heart of payments systems, George said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is true that new forms of money transmission... are being developed, sometimes outside the conventional banking system. But I suspect that they, too, will typically depend upon clearing through the banking system,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>To the extent that these create what will effectively be direct deposits they will represent &quot;banking&quot; in a different form and logically be subject to regulation in much the same way as conventional deposits, George said.</p>
<p>He said changes in banks' businesses and the environment in which they operated had not yet fundamentally affected &quot;their key functions or importance of those functions to the economy&quot;.</p>
<p>While there were a range of reasons for the public oversight of non-bank financial institutions and markets, they were not subject to the same &quot;systemic' risks such as runs on a bank, George said.</p>
