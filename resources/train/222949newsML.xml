<p>At least nine people were injured when a bomb exploded in a busy marketplace in the heart of Srinagar's business district on Thursday, police said.</p>
<p>The explosive device, placed on a bicycle and apparently targeted at security personnel, went off soon after a vehicle carrying security personnel passed by.</p>
<p>&quot;The blast was so powerful that it damaged the window panes of adjacent buildings,&quot; the United News of India agency said.</p>
<p>Police officials told Reuters the bomb exploded in the bustling commercial and residential district of Maghermal Bagh in Srinagar, the summer capital of northern Jammu and Kashmir state.</p>
<p>All nine injured were taken to hospital with two said to be in critical condition.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have died in separatist violence in predominantly Hindu India's only Moslem-majority state since an Islamic revolt began in 1990.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Indian paratroopers raided Mirwaiz Manzil, the home of the Kashmir Valley's chief cleric, Umer Farooq. He is also chairman of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, the Kashmir valley's largest political grouping.</p>
<p>&quot;They ransacked the office,&quot; a Hurriyat spokesman said. &quot;It is littered with overturned furniture and other paraphernalia.&quot;</p>
<p>Six people were arrested during the raid, police said in a statement. One of them was Umer Farooq's personal bodyguard.</p>
<p>The statement said the men were militants who led the police to a hidden cache of arms nearby, which included pistols, rifles, some grenades and a wireless set.</p>
<p>Police and officials say there are dozens of separatist groups fighting either for independence or merger of Kasmhmir with neighbouring Pakistan.</p>
<p>A new government led by Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah took power in Kashmir in October after the pro-India National Conference party swept the polls.</p>
<p>New Delhi had ruled the state directly for seven years before that.</p>
