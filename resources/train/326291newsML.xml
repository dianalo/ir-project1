<title>USA: JUDGE RULES FOR PENTHOUSE IN U.S. MILITARY CASE.</title>
<headline>JUDGE RULES FOR PENTHOUSE IN U.S. MILITARY CASE.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that a new law banning the sale of sexually explicit material at U.S. government-operated military stores violates the First Amendment.</p>
<p>In a victory for Penthouse magazine, which challenged the law, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ordered that the Department of Defence be permanently restrained from changing the military's existing stock or selling policies.</p>
<p>General Media Communications Inc, which publishes Penthouse, and a group of trade associations sued the Department of Defence in October to block enforcement of the Military Honour and Decency Act, which restricts the dissemination of &quot;sexually explicit material&quot; within the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The law was enacted on Sept 23, 1996, when it was signed by President Bill Clinton. It had been scheduled to take effect on Dec 22, but Scheindlin issued a restraining order on Dec 20 temporarily blocking the Defence Department from enforcing the provisions.</p>
<p>The act's provisions prohibit the sale or rental of such material on property controlled by the Defence Department including commissaries and ship stores.</p>
<p>It also bans the sale or rental of such material by a member of the Armed Forces or a civilian officer or employee acting in an official capacity.</p>
