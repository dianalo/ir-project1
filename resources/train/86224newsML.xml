<headline>FOCUS - Norsk Hydro warns of downturn in H2 profits.</headline>
<dateline>OSLO 1996-09-30</dateline>

<p>Norway's largest listed company, Norsk Hydro ASA, said on Monday it expected earnings in the second half of the year to be hit by a recent downturn in aluminium prices.</p>
<p>It added that production problems at the North Sea Lille-Frigg gas condensate field meant it might not be able to fully recover its investment of 470 million crowns in the development.</p>
<p>Hydro's profit comments were contained in a statement announcing a new issue of 20-year debentures totalling $250 million in the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Under U.S. securities regulations, it was obliged to issue a prospectus to investors detailing information on recent developments.</p>
<p>The energy, chemicals, metals and fertiliser giant said the three-month price for aluminium on the London Metal Exchange had averaged slightly under $1,500 per tonne in the third quarter of 1996, compared with $1,861 in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The current low prices are expected to adversely affect earnings in the third and fourth quarters of 1996, compared with the corresponding periods in 1995,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The announcement over possible new losses in the Lille-Frigg project was in addition to a 755 million crowns write-down which the group took in the second quarter of 1995 due to a 40 percent drop in recoverable reserve estimates.</p>
<p>Hydro has a 33 percent stake in the Lille-Frigg field, which is operated by Elf Petroleum.</p>
<p>&quot;In September 1996, the operator of the Lille-Frigg ...informed the licensees that the startup of technical modifications for two shut-in wells on the field was not successful.</p>
<p>&quot;Sufficient information is not available at this time to evaluate if either of the wells can be restored. To this extent production problems are not resolved, estimated recoverable reserves and future revenues may be significantly reduced and Hydro's carrying value of the investment of approximately NOK 470 million may not be fully recoverable,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Norsk Hydro said it would evaluate the need for recording an impairment loss related to the Lille-Frigg field when further information regarding production forecasts for the Frigg area was available.</p>
