<p>Democracy movement leader Martin Lee on Thursday brushed off charges of &quot;badmouthing&quot; Hong Kong and said he would make high-profile trips abroad to ensure the world's eyes are watching as China takes over the territory.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we ought to make sure Hong Kong is on the political map of every major country in the world, I think it is important to make sure that the world is watching us,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;Other than that I cannot really see any safeguard of any kind that freedoms in Hong Kong can be protected under the rule of law after July 1,&quot; Lee told Hong Kong radio in an interview.</p>
<p>Lee, the chairman of the popular Democratic Party, said he expected post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa to give him a hard time when they meet for consultations on March 17 by renewing allegations that the democrat &quot;badmouthed&quot; Hong Kong overseas.</p>
<p>But he said he was ready to defend himself against Tung, who was picked by a China-controlled committee last December to govern Hong Kong after the July 1 sovereignty transfer.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure he'll raise with me the 'badmouthing' of Hong Kong business and of course I would have ready answers for him.&quot;</p>
<p>The meeting, the Democratic Party's second with Tung, comes three days before Lee sets off on a lobbying and fund-raising mission to the United States and Canada, where he will meet politicians, businessmen and Chinese communities.</p>
<p>The tour is the latest in a series of trips to North America, Europe and Australia to raise awareness of the dangers facing Hong Kong's fundamental freedoms after Britain hands back the colony, ending a century and a half of colonial rule.</p>
<p>Under a Sino-British treaty, Hong Kong is promised a high degree of autonomy and the retention of capitalism for 50 years.</p>
<p>But just four months from the handover, the territory of 6.4 million is nervous over a China-crafted shadow legislature that will replace the elected Legco, and Beijing's plans to roll back laws protecting civil rights and democratic freedoms.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole objective of my doing these things is to try to have the support of as many governments as possible to pass on the right message to the Chinese leaders that they will keep Hong Kong free,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;And...not do the sort of terrible things they have decided to do to Hong Kong, set up this provisional legislature and to pass laws which were clearly intended to restrict freedoms.&quot;</p>
<p>Tung, who made friendly overtures to Lee's party soon after he was picked as Hong Kong's future leader, has adopted an increasingly authoritarian stance, echoing China's views.</p>
<p>He has slammed the pro-democracy camp, which he claims has blackened Hong Kong's image abroad and he has attacked their fund-raising links with overseas political groups, ties that are branded illegal under Hong Kong's future constitution.</p>
<p>Lee defended his fund-raising as above-board and said he was merely asking for donations from Chinese communities and not from foreign politicians. REUTER TEL PWH</p>
