<p>New York Knicks shooting guard Allan Houston underwent successful surgery to repair partially torn ligaments in his right wrist on Monday, the team reported.</p>
<p>Houston will wear a cast on the wrist for seven weeks before beginning a strength and motion rehabilitation programme.</p>
<p>&quot;This was an injury that had been bothering Allan over the course of the season,&quot; said Knicks general manager Ernie Grunfeld. &quot;The timing of the surgery, at the start of the off-season, could not have worked out better.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking forward to having Allan at full strength when we begin training camp in October,&quot; Grunfeld said.</p>
<p>Houston, who signed a seven-year, $56 million free agent contract with the Knicks last off-season, averaged 14.8 points and shot 42.3 percent from the field during the regular season.</p>
<p>In the playoffs, he averaged 19.2 points and shot 50 percent (26-of-52) from three-point range, but was one of the players suspended for one game during the Eastern Conference semifinals with the Miami Heat for leaving the Knicks bench during an altercation.</p>
