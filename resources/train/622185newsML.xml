<p>Captured Chinese fishermen, at the centre of a growing row between Beijing and Manila, on Wednesday begged for food and water on the boat where they have languished for over a week off the Philippine coast.</p>
<p>&quot;Rice! Water!&quot; the fishermen pleaded when journalists visited them, eight days after they were seized by the Philippine coastguard near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a barely visible cluster of rocks in the South China Sea which both countries claim.</p>
<p>China on Tuesday protested to the Philippines over the arrest of the 21 fishermen which it said were in Chinese waters.</p>
<p>Manila had kept the arrests secret until the Chinese protest.</p>
<p>A Philippine Navy patrol ship seized the boat off the shoal on May 20 after a dramatic chase during which the Filipinos fired warning shots across bow of the Chinese boat to force it to stop, Coast Guard officials said.</p>
<p>The boat is now anchored under guard off Subic freeport, 90 km (56 miles) northwest of Manila.</p>
<p>The captain and chief engineer are in jail in Subic and local police chief Enrique Romero told Reuters he was ready to file charges against the 21 fishermen for illegally fishing near the shoal.</p>
<p>Police said they would bring the fishermen food and water.</p>
<p>The latest diplomatic clash between the two countries broke out while their senior officials were meeting in Beijing to try to defuse growing tension over their rival claims to tiny islands and rocky outcrops in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Beijing insists all the islands, reefs and rocks in the South China Sea historically belong to China. Manila says the 16 km (10 mile) rock formation lies within its exclusive economic zone, giving it ownership.</p>
<p>The rocks, which almost disappear at high tide and which serve as little more than a place for smugglers to rest, lie 200 km (125 miles) west of the Philippines' mainland Zambales province.</p>
<p>It is the third time this month the two countries have come to diplomatic blows over the outcrop.</p>
<p>China earlier protested against the hoisting by Filipinos of their national flag over the rocks. It protested again when a group of Philippine congressmen sailed to the shoal to be photographed standing under the flag.</p>
<p>Despite the arrests, Philippine officials have continued to urge efforts to reduce the growing tension between the two countries.</p>
<p>The shoal lies well north of the Spratly Islands, a cluster of potentially oil-rich isles, reefs and atolls that the two countries are also scrapping over. The Spratlys are also claimed wholly or in part by Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.</p>
