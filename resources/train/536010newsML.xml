<p>The Chemical Weapons Convention that came before the U.S. Senate on Thursday aims to ban the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons worldwide.</p>
<p>It was opened for signature in January, 1993 after two decades of negotiations and has already been signed by 164 states and ratified by 74.</p>
<p>Japan, India and South Africa are among those that have ratified the treaty. China, Russia and Iran have signed but not ratified. Non-signatories include Iraq and Libya.</p>
<p>The treaty comes into effect next Tuesday. Countries that do not ratify by that date will not be eligible for membership on the executive council, which sets rules for verification.</p>
<p>The treaty obliges members to eliminate all chemical weapons and production facilities by 2007. The United States is already obliged under its own law to do so by 2004.</p>
<p>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is being created to conduct inspections of companies using chemicals covered by the treaty. A member can request a &quot;challenge inspection&quot; of a site in another nation.</p>
<p>Under the treaty, training and equipment must be provided to any member threatened by chemical weapons and relevant . technology must be transferred to a threatened state.</p>
<p>Riot control agents, like tear gas, are allowed for law enforcement.</p>
<p>Members may produce only a very limited amount of dangerous chemicals with no commercial value, like sarin and mustard gas, for research and defence needs.</p>
<p>Production is not restricted of toxic chemicals with a commercial use that could be used for weapons production, including some pesticides. But plants using or producing them must be reported and are open for inspection.</p>
<p>The United States, Russia and Iraq are the only countries that formally acknowledge they possess chemical weapons, but many others have or are seeking the ability to make them, including China, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea and Libya.</p>
