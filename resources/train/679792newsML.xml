<p>The Belgrade Stock Exchange (BSE) reported on Monday a 15 percent increase in its turnover in the week ending June 20 as investors began to lose interest in giro-money and sought moreety in state T-bills.</p>
<p>Total turnover rose to 40.412 million dinars in 151 transactions from 35.139 million dinars in 144 deals a week ago, the bourse said.</p>
<p>Except for 0.2 million dinars worth of shares, the entire activity was conducted on the primary market.</p>
<p>&quot;Capital has started to fly from risky and expensive giro-money to state T-bills. The state is seen as a more reliable debtor although the interest on its paper is lower,&quot; a trader told Reuters.</p>
<p>Traders also said the appearance of state T-bills on May 12, which carry a 4.5 percent in monthly interest, influenced interest rates on other instruments to begin to decline.</p>
<p>&quot;The average cost of borrowing is now ranging between 7.00 and 10.00 percent per month compared to a monthly 12-20 percent several weeks ago and the decline has not resulted from any state administrative measures,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Analysts insisted there were hardly any borrowers who could service their debt at enormous monthly interest at a time when official average monthly inflation stood at 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If debtors were more reliable, seven percent interest would not be on a monthly but on a quarterly, maybe half-year basis,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>Traders said market liquidity was slightly improved with the quantity of funds more or less unchanged. But around one third of 105 Yugoslav banks still faced liquidity problems.</p>
<p>For the week ending June 20, the BSE reported the following details:</p>
<p>* Commercial paper accounted for 141 transactions totalling 25.992 million dinars.</p>
<p>* Treasury bills traded four times for a volume of 0.442 million dinars.</p>
<p>Interest rates on commercial paper and treasury bills ranged between 6.00 and 13.00 percent per month, while maturity stood between seven and 360 days.</p>
<p>* The bourse reported a sale of state T-bills worth 13.5 million dinars.</p>
<p>* There was no trade in the central bank short-term bonds.</p>
<p>* Over-the-counter trade in commercial paper and treasury bills fell to 30.356 million dinars from 36.432 million.</p>
<p>* OTC trade in giro money, with banks trading their surplus liquidity, declined to 25.75 million dinars from 31.1 million. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
