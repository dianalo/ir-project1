<p>Merchant bank Kempen &amp; Co NV is in talks to take over a British asset management firm, chairman Joop Krant told a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>Krant did not identify the takeover candidate, but said it would be a relatively small company with a team of four or five employees specialising in investments in small and medium-sized companies throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Kempen now has investments in the small and midcap segment under its management of about 1.3 billion guilders, which makes the firm the market leader in this sector in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>But given the upcoming unification process in the European Union, asset allocations will change in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kempen is looking for an experienced asset manager with a proven track record and expertise in investments outside Kempen's present regions, Krant said.</p>
<p>Kempen will also introduce a new property fund in the next few weeks, which will invest in about 150 bourse-listed real estate funds around the world. Another new product to be launched shortly will be a fund investing in the financial services sector which is expected to show further growth.</p>
<p>Krant said Kempen expected to maintain its corporate finance activities at the high levels reached in 1996 and saw a further growth of its asset management division.</p>
<p>The company almost doubled its total assets under management to about four billion guilders last year, not only because of rising securities prices but also through a strong growth in the number of clients.</p>
<p>With a return on shareholders equity of 27 percent and a strong solvency rate, Kempen expects to have a strong position to secure further expansion.</p>
<p>Krant reiterated Kempen expected to post a further profit rise in 1997. Last year's net profit almost doubled to 30.2 million guilders.</p>
<p>Although falling stock prices in recent weeks showed that markets had become more volatile and more corrections were seen possible, Kempen remained positive about share market trends.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still reasonably optimistic about share investments in the longer term, say the next three or four years,&quot; Krant said.</p>
