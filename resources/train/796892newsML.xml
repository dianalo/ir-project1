<headline>U.N. considers travel, arms ban on Sierra Leone.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1997-08-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.N. Security Council members are considering imposing a travel and arms ban on Sierra Leone, possibly next week, if its military junta insists on holding onto power, diplomats said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The council, in a formal statement a week ago, threatened &quot;appropriate&quot; but unspecified measures against the junta and its supporters, a diplomatic euphemism for sanctions.</p>
<p>West African troops, led by Nigeria, have already imposed an air, sea and land blockade against Sierra Leone after some low-ranking army officers and supporting militia groups toppled the elected government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. No country has recognized the junta.</p>
<p>The council's actions, which may follow a visit from African officials, could mark a beginning of more severe measures against the new rulers in the former British colony.</p>
<p>Talks by  West African regional leaders broke down on July 30 when junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma said the military would stay in power until the year 2001.</p>
<p>The council has also accused the junta of interfering with the delivery of relief supplies, threatening civilians and foreigners with violence and prompting a flow of refugees to neighboring Guinea where Kabbah is in exile.</p>
<p>The African embargo has already caused severe shortages in Freetown, the capital. Many shops, banks and other businesses remain closed because of looting by marauding soldiers, despite repeated warnings by the junta for their owners to reopen them.</p>
