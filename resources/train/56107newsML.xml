<p>Shipping industry solutions to tough environmental issues must be guided more by science and less by reaction to public pressure, a leading marine safety expert said on Monday.</p>
<p>The warning came on Monday from Sven Ullring, president of Det Norske Veritas, the Norwegian ship classification society, at an international marine insurance conference in Oslo.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1967 the Torrey Canyon grounded off the British coast releasing 120,000 tonnes of crude oil. Almost overnight public perception changed, and accidental marine spills were seen as the main marine pollutant. Spectacular oil spills have remained in the heaqdlines ever since,&quot; said Ullring.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the protection of the environment should not rely merely on management by disaster. A more consistent and future based approach to the environmental challenge is strongly needed, guided more by scientific basis and less by public pressure,&quot; he said</p>
<p>Ullring said the industry should spend more time on issues such as the amount of sulphrous and nitrous ommissions pumped into the atmosphere by ships, and oil spillage into the sea. He added that a new longer term vision requires a re-think on shipping and its contribution to sustainable transport of people and goods.</p>
<p>&quot;We should gain public acceptance of shipping as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation and maintain this position,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He pointed to the Norwegian Green Ships research and development programme, which defined a &quot;green' ship as one which does not pollute the sea or the air, and which has protection against oil spills in the event of accidents.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that investment and research should give focus to projects that enable the changes towards sustainability and reduced environmental impact.The Green Ships programme contributed to these goals,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He called for new incentives to be introduced to make it beneficial to be ahead of tighter environmental regulations.</p>
<p>&quot;Ships of the future will need much better performance, be much safer and more environmentally friendly than they are today. Shipping cannot evade its part in a development that meets global needs today without compromising the needs and aspirations of future generations,&quot; he said.</p>
