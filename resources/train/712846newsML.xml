<headline>Russian c.bank draws mutual funds rules for banks.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>The Russian central bank has issued rules for commercial banks to set up mutual funds and expects at least 15 banks to begin fund operations by year's end, a senior central bank official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that no fewer than 15 banks will set up mutual funds by the end of the year,&quot; Dmitry Budakov, head of the department for control of bank activities on the financial markets, told a news conference.</p>
<p>The regulation does not address whether foreign individuals and companies could invest in the funds, he said.</p>
<p>Currently there are six mutual funds in Russia set up by foreign-managed financial institutions.</p>
<p>Domestic investors, especially small investors, are secondary players in the booming Russian equity market but are expected to take a leading role in coming years, partly on the back of the emergence of strong domestic mutual funds.</p>
<p>Budakov said Russian commercial banks previously had tried to set up mutual funds, without a regulatory framework, but had failed, mainly because of unhappy experience of many Russians with pyramid scheme funds, which existed several years ago.</p>
<p>The new regulation separates fund and bank assets, safeguarding the mutual funds in the case of the parent bank's bankruptcy, he added. Fund assets will be kept in the banks' central bank accounts.</p>
<p>The regulation also limits funds' investment in a single security to 15 percent of assets, though investment in government securities has no cap, Budakov said.</p>
