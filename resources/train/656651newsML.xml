<title>USA: Transatlantic sweet crudes scarce on US Gulf Coast.</title>
<headline>Transatlantic sweet crudes scarce on US Gulf Coast.</headline>

<p>Offerings of crude oil from West Africa and the North Sea were scarce on the thirsty U.S. Gulf Coast on Thursday, prompting refiners to buy more domestic and regional sweet grades, traders said.</p>
<p>A European major sold several West African cargoes into Asia, traders said. Together with recent sales into the U.S. East Coast, West African offerings for July delivery were seen as limited.</p>
<p>&quot;West African (availabilities) have really cleaned up,&quot; a Gulf Coast trader said.</p>
<p>North Sea pickings were also slim, although another European company was offering Norwegian Oseberg for second-half July delivery, asking around 50 cents under August West Texas Intermediate/Cushing.</p>
<p>A narrow WTI/Brent arbitrage was keeping most transatlantic cargoes away from the Gulf for now, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The arb is slightly open to the Gulf Coast, but it's definitely closed to the Midcontinent,&quot; a crude seller said.</p>
<p>July WTI was fetching a premium of around $1.15-25 a barrel to July Brent on Thursday afternoon, about five cents higher than late Wednesday. Dated Brent was still assessed around July Brent minus 70 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>The tight arbitrage drove some refiners to pick up more domestic and regional grades, giving those prices a slight lift.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a U.S. company bought a cargo of Colombian Cusiana crude loading July 20-24 for $1.30 a barrel under WTI, about five to 10 cents stronger than previous deals for July loadings early this week and last week.</p>
<p>Traders said the U.S. company was short Brent crude to two U.S. refiners, and was trying to cover its obligations with Cusiana.</p>
<p>On the domestic side, Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James was trading around 14 cents under WTI/Cushing, up from around 20 cents discount on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see a real deficit of sweet crude. There's less than there was, but it's still ample,&quot; a U.S. buyer said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a Saharan Blend cargo that had been distressed in early June was put into Canadian storage for later sale to a local refiner, traders said.</p>
<p>In Latin America, Venezuelan Mesa-30 crude was last heard done at $3.41 under WTI for July loading. The crude was pegged in the neighborhood of $3.25-50 under the U.S. benchmark.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the region, Colombia's state oil company Ecopetrol was tendering a Cano Limon cargo for July 20-31 loading, with bids due on Thursday. The cargo was expected to be awarded on Friday.</p>
