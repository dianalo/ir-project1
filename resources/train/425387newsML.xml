<headline>China says to back Agribusiness Trust debt.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1997-03-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>China said on Thursday it would stand behind the principal of debts of the failed China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp (CADTIC) but would not repay interest.</p>
<p>The China Securities newspaper published a notice by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, saying that financial obligations would be repaid starting on December 1.</p>
<p>&quot;...in order to make speedy repayment to reduce the financial burden of legal entities, the China Construction Bank will repay in full the principal of debts to domestic entities of the former CADTIC head office and branch offices, starting December 1,&quot; the notice said.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest will not be paid.&quot;</p>
<p>CADTIC was shut in January after it was stung with huge losses due to financial irregularities.</p>
<p>China's financial authorities have not disclosed details of the irregularities.  </p>
<p>CADTIC's management was handed over to the China Construction Bank and its securities operations were assumed by the China Xinda Trust and Investment Corp, a Construction Bank affiliate.</p>
<p>Xinda officials said the obligations included institutional deposits as well as money market obligations. Domestic companies were told they could register their claims from March 20 to June 20.</p>
