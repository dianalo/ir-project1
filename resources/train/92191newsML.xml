<p>French road and air express distribution company, Jet Services, said it was considering the creation of air cargo routes in southern Europe.</p>
<p>Jet Services recently announced the launch of freighter routes between Coventry and Paris/Charles de Gaulle airport and Kassel (Germany) and CDG using 4.5-tonne capacity Metroliner aircraft.</p>
<p>The routes, scheduled to be launched later this month, are part of a strategy to extend the distribution network of Jet Services European subsidiary, Axor's &quot;next-day&quot; express service which currently covers France, the Benelux and Germany.</p>
<p>Jet Services, via its airline subsidiary, Air Jet, already operates a Liege-CDG freighter route and domestic all-cargo flights linking Paris with Marseille, Montpellier, Toulouse, Strasbourg and Rennes.</p>
<p>&quot;The development of Axor's network is customer-driven and the indications are that there will be a need for freighter links between southern Europe, notably northern Italy and Catalonia and our hub at CDG, probably during the first quarter of 1997,&quot; a company official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The new routes could make stopovers at Marseille where Jet Services operates a sub-hub for south-east France traffic, the official said.</p>
<p>Axor also plans to open three road distribution hubs in Germany during the Autumn at Stuttgart, Hamburg and Munich, to handle express shipments, the official added.</p>
<p>Axor's expansion in Europe forms part of a Jet Services' investment programme, announced earlier this year and covering a one-year period, totalling Ffr33m. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017</p>
