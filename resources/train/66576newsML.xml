<p>The Budapest office of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday that an IMF report issued in Washington should not be read as an expression of concern about Hungary's yen-based bond issues.</p>
<p>A statement from Mark Allen, IMF senior representative in Hungary, said a Reuters report drawing on information from the IMF's International Capital Markets Report &quot;could be read as implying that the IMF was concerned about the yen bonds issued by the National Bank of Hungary (NBH).</p>
<p>&quot;This is absolutely not the case,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fund believes that Hungarian government policies are such as should give full confidence to international financial markets,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It noted Hungary has sharply reduced its fiscal and current account deficits and &quot;substantially reduced its gross and net external debt and prepaid a number of borrowings&quot;.</p>
<p>The IMF's Washington report, cited by Reuters, questioned whether investors adequately understood the risks entailed in some bond issues from developing countries.</p>
<p>It said Samurai and Euroyen issues by the NBH were being snapped up by investors in Japan, where interest rates are low, even though the NBH has subinvestment grade ratings from Moody's Investors Services and Standard and Poor's.</p>
<p>Allen added in a telephone interview that a team of IMF experts is in Hungary to review the country's 1997 budget plans while another team just left after looking into plans for a &quot;securitisation of the National Bank of Hungary's claims on the national government as a result of devaluation&quot;.</p>
<p>Allen said the balance of the claim was some 1.5 trillion forints, or 30 percent of GDP, as of July. Hungary instituted a crawling peg devaluation scheme last March, starting at 1.3 percent and decreased to 1.2 percent in January.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a question regarding the internal relations of the public sector...and how to regularise transactions between the two institutions,&quot; Allen said.</p>
