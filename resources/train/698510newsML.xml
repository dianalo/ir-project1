<title>BULGARIA: German firm to supply heating meters to Bulgaria.</title>

<p>Germany's Spaner Pollux GmbH has won a tender for supplying 8,000 heating meters to district heating firms in Bulgaria under a pilot project funded by the World Bank, the Energy Committee said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Spaner Pollux's offer is worth six million marks and includes a five year service guarantee,&quot; a committee statement said.</p>
<p>It said the World Bank had approved the signing of a contract with the German firm.</p>
<p>The World Bank agreed earlier this year to transfer $12 million from an existing loan to the project to supply a total of 18,000 heating meters to Bulgaria's heating plants.</p>
<p>The Energy Committee will use the cash from a $98 million loan extended to the construction ministry last year for the modernisation of the water system.</p>
<p>The World Bank has said heating meters would be distributed to 15 district heating firms. About 17 percent of Bulgarians are customers of these firms and would benefit from the project.</p>
<p>Heating meters will help Bulgarians pay for their heating according to their consumption instead of at a flat rate as they do now. Costs have risen sharply with the collapse of the lev in recent months. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-91188</p>
