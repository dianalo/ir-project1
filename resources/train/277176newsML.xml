<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets Thursday traded briskly as packers moved quickly to secure live inventory following the Christmas holiday on Wednesday, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Packers paid $66.00 per cwt for the cattle, up $1.00 from the majority of last week's sales. There were thin sales Friday at $65.25.</p>
<p>About 35,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma areas and about 30,000 sold in Kansas, the sources said. Actual sales figures could be higher once all the paperwork is completed, they said.  </p>
<p>Most of the sales were completed in a short time before midday, the feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Many beef plants were closed Tuesday and Wednesday for the holiday and consequently short on cattle supplies, they said.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices also were buoyed by outlooks for firm beef prices because of holiday disruptions in production this week and next, with most plants closed Wednesday, New Years Day, according to the feedlot sources.</p>
