<headline>German debt remains lower, correction seen due.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-02-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>German debt settled at lower levels in late trade on Wednesday, pressured by declines on the U.S. market despite an initial jump on inflation data, but amid no signs of the correction many dealers see as overdue.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was showing signs of being technically overbought, but said investors were still taking every opportunity to buy into declines.</p>
<p>March Bunds were down 25 points at 103.49 points in late trade, virtually unchanged from their opening level, after hitting a high of 103.85 points and a low of 103.46 over the day.  </p>
<p>Dealings on Thursday will likely focus on the anticipated release of January M3 money supply data on Thursday or Friday as well as on overnight U.S. debt market movements.</p>
<p>Traders generally do not expect the data to spark market expectations for a Bundesbank rate cut, including at Thursday's fortnightly council meeting.</p>
<p>On a technical basis, DTB March Bund futures should find support at 103.26, while resistance is evident at 104.00 and 104.24, according to traders.</p>
