<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed lower on Wednesday, although turnover was up sharply on foreign buying of selected blue chips, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed 1.74 points lower at 592.66. John Keells Holdings fell four rupees to 190, Richard Pieris &amp; Co 3.75 to 80.25.</p>
<p>Most price declines were on small quantities, and by retail investors looking for last-minute profits to celebrate the December festivities, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail investors are taking every last cent they can from the stock market to spend in the supermarket,&quot; said one broker.  </p>
<p>Turnover, however, was a healthy 149.4 million rupees on 3.8 million shares due to foreign buying of National Development Bank and Asian Hotels, brokers said. Closing turnover on Tuesday was 9.8 million rupees.</p>
<p>&quot;There are foreign investors picking up volumes of selected stocks, though local institutions are waiting to see where the index will bottom out,&quot; said Shakthi Ranatunga a broker at Lanka Securities.</p>
<p>Local buying of 668,100 Lanka Orix Leasing at 142.25 propped up turnover. A parcel of 600,000 Tea Services shares was held on overnight bid at 60 rupees. --Prithi kodagoda (941) 434319</p>
