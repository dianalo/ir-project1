<p>European Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Thursday he would block Spanish subsidies for a Renault plant in Spain while he probed the French carmaker's decision to close a profitable Belgian assembly plant.</p>
<p>The Belgian commissioner -- who is in charge of EU competition issues -- told BRTN radio he would block government aid worth half a billion Belgian francs ($14 million) -- unless Renault management changed its attitude on the closure of its Vilvoorde plant near Brussels.</p>
<p>In a transcript of the interview made available to Reuters, Van Miert said he had received the Renault dossier on Spanish aid to investments in Valladolid on Wednesday, adding: &quot;I will block this dossier as long as Renault behaves the way it does.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that in the current context and (given) Renault's attitude that government aid cannot be granted or... allowed when it is for purposes as is now the case,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Van Miert's spokesman appeared later to contradict the Commissioner and denied aid had been blocked, saying all such cases were scrutinised by Commission officials.</p>
<p>&quot;He never said he was going to block it, he just said that this type of aid dossier has to be examined in great detail,&quot; said Willy Helin.</p>
<p>In the BRTN interview, Van Miert lambasted Renault for trying to move part of a profitable operation to another location in the EU with government aid.</p>
<p>But asked whether the blocking could be seen as Commission punishment for Renault, Van Miert said &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is of course absurd that they close a profitable company such as (Renault Industrie Belgique in) Vilvoorde and carry out additional investment in Spain with government aid,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is indefensible that profitable activities are moved from one side of the European Union with government aid...it can't be that with Spanish government aid (Renault) tries to lure activities away which are normally profitable.&quot;</p>
<p>Renault's announced plans to close its Vilvoorde operation have sparked outrage in Van Miert's native country Belgium, where chances of re-employment for over 3,000 workers are slim.</p>
<p>The Belgian government is suing Renault over what it says is its flouting of Belgian and European rules on informing and consulting staff on key strategic decisions.</p>
<p>Helin said aid requests like Renault's demand for aid to its planned $85-million investment in a new plant in Valladolid were always studied closely by the Commission though he added that this case had obvious current relevance.</p>
<p>&quot;Were it confirmed that this (aid request) would amount to a transfer from one viable operation to another, we would take an even closer look than normal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>News of the probe comes the day after the EU executive said that Renault had clearly breached European Union directives in its handling of plans to close its Belgian assembly plant.</p>
<p>Commission spokesman Nikolaus Van der Pas told Reuters following the executive's weekly meeting that the Commissioners felt Renault was in breach of two EU directives related to factory closures.</p>
<p>One insists companies negotiate with workers before taking a final decision on closure and the other says public authorities must be notified in advance.</p>
<p>Both directives have become law in France and Belgium, but the Commission said it was up to a member state or the workers to press the issue in court.</p>
<p>Commission sources said on Wednesday that Van Miert had also asked his officials to study whether companies were &quot;aid hopping&quot; around the 15-country bloc to get maximum profit from the various regional, national and EU-level aid money on offer before moving elsewhere once aid dried up.
