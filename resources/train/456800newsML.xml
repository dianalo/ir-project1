<p>Nearly 2,000 incidents of poll-related violence in the run-up to Sri Lanka's local government elections on Friday could lead to low voter turnout, an independent monitoring group said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our fear is that all this violence could be a build-up for election day,&quot; Arjuna Parakrama of the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence, told a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Could the people who took part in this violence be setting the stage, creating an environment, for a situation where there will be a low voter turnout?&quot; Parakrama said.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka goes to the polls on Friday to elect members to 228 local councils after five weeks of campaigning often marred by violence.</p>
<p>The UNP said on Friday it was concerned that widespread violence would keep voters away on polling day.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to see over a 60 percent voter turnout. A high poll would work in favour of us,&quot; UNP leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.</p>
<p>As of Thursday morning, there had been 1,914 incidents of election-related violence reported by the centre, making this by far the most trouble-filled local government election in recent times, Parakrama said.</p>
<p>The reported incidents included four cases of murder, 438 cases of assault and 197 instances of threats and intimidation, it said.</p>
<p>The 1991 local government election and the 1993 election for provincial councils recorded 400 and 550 incidents of violence respectively, the centre said.</p>
<p>It said the ruling People's Alliance (PA) coalition was responsible for 46 percent of the violent acts, while the main opposition United National Party (UNP) was responsible for 26 percent. The remainder was attributed to other minor political parties.</p>
<p>PA members have previously accused the UNP of lodging bogus complaints of violence against its supporters to win voter sympathy.</p>
<p>Nearly 20,000 candidates from 12 political parties and 132 independent groups are contesting the election throughout the country except in the northern and eastern provinces, where government forces are battling separatist Tamil guerrillas.</p>
