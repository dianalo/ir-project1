<p>Plains Resources Inc said Wednesday it entered into a definitive agreement to buy for $25 million all of Chevron Corp's interest in a producing oil field and related fee acreage in the L.A. Basin in California.</p>
<p>The field is now producing about 800 barrels of oil per day and 800,000 cubic feet (company corrects from 800 million cubic feet) of natural gas a day from 55 producing wells.</p>
<p>The acquisition, which is scheduled to close in March, is subject to customary environmental, title and related due diligence.</p>
<p>The effective date for the acquisition will be Feb 1.</p>
<p>The company said it expects to finance the purchase with working capital and draws on the company's $125 million revolving credit facility.  As of Feb 25, about $75 million was outstanding on the credit facility.</p>
<p>The company also said it is increasing its credit facility to $165 million, but that the increase was not necessary to complete the acquisition. It would, said the company, provide it with additional capacity for future acquisitions and working capital needs.</p>
<p>A company spokesperson said the exploitation plan for this property includes decreasing unit expenses and increasing production volumes using techniques similar to those at the company's other L.A. Basin properties.  Plains estimates the property will add about 20 million barrels of oil to its proved reserves.  At year-end 1996, Plains reported proved reserves of 122 million barrels of oil equivalent.</p>
