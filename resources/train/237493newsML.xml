<p>The Polisario Front, seeking independence for Western Sahara, called on Spain on Thursday to mediate talks with Morocco to resolve a dispute over the North African territory.</p>
<p>Mahfud el Beiba, prime minister of the Polisario Front's self-proclaimed republic in Western Sahara, told a news conference in Seville that Spain had a responsiblity as the former colonial ruler to help settle the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;The two parties need someone to support and push talks, and Spain has an important responsibility in the matter since it left the problem unresolved,&quot; Beiba said after talks with Spain's regional government in Andalucia.</p>
<p>After Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1976, Polisario guerrillas supported by Algeria fought Moroccan troops for control until a 1991 U.N. sponsored truce.</p>
<p>A referendum promised under the treaty will decide whether Western Sahara should be incorporated into Morocco or become independent. It was orginally due in 1992 but has been stalled by arguments over who is eligible to take part in the vote.</p>
<p>Beiba said on Thursday that the Polisario Front was ready for mediated talks in a neutral country, and it was simply waiting for Morocco to give the sign that it was willing to participate.</p>
<p>Last month, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended a six-month renewal of the U.N. operation in Western Sahara, encouraged by signs that both sides had started private talks. King Hassan said such talks had been inconclusive.</p>
