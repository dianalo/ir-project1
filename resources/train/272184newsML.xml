<p>Giant prancing horses, a shopping mall on a canal, and a world-class golf course.</p>
<p>For a developing country like Malaysia, Country Heights Holdings Bhd's flamboyant touch has made it unique in an otherwise drab property development industry.</p>
<p>&quot;It is one of the most innovative property developers around,&quot; said Jean Wong, property analyst at brokerage J.M. Sassoon in Kuala Lumpur. &quot;Their emphasis is on good design. They cater to the exclusive end of the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Architect Puvan Selvanathan, managing director of Zone Project Management Sdn Bhd said: &quot;The company is now pandering to the Chinese market, while the land sales were pitched at a different market. It is picking and choosing its projects.&quot;</p>
<p>Malaysian property developers are tapping a vein of newly rich, lifestyle-conscious professionals prepared to pay top dollar for luxury living, analysts said.</p>
<p>Country Heights prides itself on having started this trend.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten years ago Country Heights was in the outback of Kuala Lumpur. Then we turned 400 acres into a homestead, and now a lot of people are attempting to do the same,&quot; Country Heights chief executive Michael Yam said in an interview this month.</p>
<p>Country Heights pioneered the concept of selling sub-divided lots of land to customers who then build their own homes. Each plot of land averages around 20,000 square feet. The company landscapes and maintains the plots and their surroundings.</p>
<p>Among the more prominent residents of the flagship Country Heights township, about 15 km from central Kuala Lumpur, are some of the most powerful players in Malaysian politics including Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and economic adviser to the government Daim Zainuddin.</p>
<p>&quot;When it was first launched, they could hardly give away the plots of land,&quot; said Selvanathan. &quot;Then after Mahathir moved in, the price jumped from around three ringgit per square foot to 48 ringgit now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company's expectations of its own performance in the near future are ambitious, and some say unrealistic.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aiming at increasing our pre-tax profits by around 20 percent per year over the next three years,&quot; said Yam. &quot;For three years now we have beaten our own forecasts.&quot;</p>
<p>Country Heights' net profit has increased 191 percent over the past two years. It reported a net profit of 20.13 million ringgit for the year to February 28, 1994. The figure for the 1996 financial year leapt to 58.58 million ringgit.</p>
<p>But J.M. Sassoon's Wong is not so sure the good times will keep rolling.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt they can meet their expected projections,&quot; she said, adding that the supply of land suitable for high-end developments was dwindling.</p>
<p>Wong also pointed to the volatility of the luxury residential property market as a matter of concern. &quot;Demand at the top-end of the market is softening,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Perhaps with that in mind, Country Heights is transforming itself from a builder of dream homes for the rich and famous to a provider of deluxe leisure and recreational facilities.</p>
<p>Located just off the North-South Expressway that bisects the Malaysian peninsula is the Mines Resort City, encompassing several projects intended to carry Country Heights into the next century.</p>
<p>The 485-room Palace of the Golden Horses hotel is located on a 13.8-acre site within the Mines Resort City. Yam describes the hotel as &quot;six-star plus&quot;. With construction well on its way to completion by mid-1997, sculptures of two giant golden horses that will greet visitors are already visible.</p>
<p>Also on the site is the 1.6 million square foot Mines Shopping Fair which will have a canal running through its centre.</p>
<p>Organisers of the 1999 World Cup Golf tournament have decided to hold the event at the Mines Resort and Golf Club, also situated within the Mines Resort City.</p>
<p>The man behind Country Heights' success is Lee Kim Yew, a Chinese entrepreneur whose ability to court figures such as Mahathir is seen by many as a major reason for the company's success.</p>
<p>&quot;Lee is quietly well-connected,&quot; said Selvanathan.</p>
