<p>Mozambique's parliament began debating the 1997 budget on Tuesday amid signs that the southern African nation's economy, crippled by years of war, is at last on the mend.</p>
<p>The government's budget document puts next year's spending at 8,196 billion meticais ($713 million) or 3,674 billion meticais more than expected receipts.</p>
<p>The 1996 budget projected spending equivalent to $601 million against income of $344 million, with the deficit met by foreign grants and loans.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi, outlining the budget in parliament in Maputo on Monday, said there had been a &quot;positive performance&quot; in all sectors of the economy this year, except mining and communications.</p>
<p>He said the the main targets for 1997 were growth of at least five percent -- and up to seven percent, if services were excluded -- and annual inflation of no more than 15 percent by December 1997.</p>
<p>He said he was confident that Mozambique was winning its battle against inflation, which was expected to end 1996 below the 22 percent target set by the government, down from 40 percent last year.</p>
<p>Mocumbi said the government would ensure public expenditure was channelled to priority areas, notably education and health for which about 42 percent of the 1997 budget is earmarked.</p>
<p>Exchange rates would continue to be determined by the market, rather than administratively, but Mocumbi was optimistic that the metical would remain stable.</p>
<p>To increase business confidence in the domestic foreign exchange market, exporters would be able to retain 100 percent of the foreign exchange they earn, instead of the present 65 percent with the rest compulsorily converted into meticais.</p>
<p>The 1996 growth rate is expected to reach six percent. Commodity exports rose by 24 percent between January and September, earning $170 million -- $44 million more than in the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>Mocumbi expected the final 1996 figure for exports to reach $210 million, as against the $190 million originally envisaged.</p>
<p>He attributed the fall in inflation to &quot;the rigour and austerity with which budgetary and monetary policy have been followed&quot;.</p>
<p>Given Mozambique's heavy dependence on imports, exchange rates were a key factor in prices.</p>
<p>Mocumbi pointed out that the Mozambican metical had devalued by only five percent between January and November. There had been a much larger devaluation of the South African rand.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of our imports come from South Africa,&quot; said Mocumbi. &quot;The devaluation of the South African currency has made those imports more accessible, thus contributing to price stability on our domestic market.&quot;</p>
<p>Mocumbi said money supply had grown by 9.7 percent -- well under the ceiling established of 11.5 percent.</p>
