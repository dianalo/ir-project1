<p>One of western Canada's largest hog processors said on Tuesday it would consider hedging its price risk on futures contracts in hog carcass cuts not currently available.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the limitations for a packer buying his hogs forward is the ability to sell his finished goods forward and that's what we're missing right now,&quot; Fletcher's Fine Foods Ltd vice-president Greg Whalley told the Canadian Wheat Board's Grain World conference delegates here.  </p>
<p>Canadian packers currently hedge by using the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's cash-settled lean-hog carcass and pork belly contracts.</p>
<p>Asked by a grain grower whether Fletcher's would hedge on a lean, barley-fed hog futures contract now being drafted by the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, Whalley said: &quot;There's very little we can sell forward. We can sell bellies on the Merc, but there isn't much opportunity to sell any other cuts forward so we could properly hedge,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Fletcher's invested C$23 million late last year to expand the annual hog kill capacity at its packing plant in Red Deer, Alberta, to two million hogs from one million, he said.</p>
<p>The expansion was done with a view to increase pork exports to the Pacific Rim and the U.S. to between 40 to 50 percent.</p>
<p>The Pacific Rim is the main target market for western Canada's burgeoning pork industry.</p>
<p>Japanese consumers buy hog loins while Korea is a noted consumer of hog bellies, Canadian pork analysts said.</p>
<p>Whalley said most Prairie pork packing in the future would likely be done under long-term contracts with producers.</p>
<p>Canada's largest grain handler, Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, acquired a 35 percent stake in Fletcher's Feb 10.</p>
<p>SWP said it bought into Fletcher's with the aim of doubling Saskatchewan's output to two million hogs a year within five years from the current one million hogs.</p>
<p>The grain handler got approval Feb 24 to issue public shares in a hog farrow-to-finish subsidiary that would operate barns throughout Saskatchewan.</p>
