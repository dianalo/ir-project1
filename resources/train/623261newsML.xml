<headline>Ford warns Hungary on tax as boosts investment.</headline>
<dateline>SZEKESFEHERVAR, Hungary 1997-05-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ford Motor Company said on Thursday it planned to increase investment in its car parts plant in Hungary but its long-term plans could be endangered by a recent tripling in local taxes.</p>
<p>Company officials of Ford Hungaria, located 65 kilometers south-west of Budapest at Szekesfehervar, announced plans to increase investments in the plant to $146.4 million by mid-1998 from $95.7 million so far.</p>
<p>&quot;As of today these announced (investments) are secure, we are committed to our suppliers and customers,&quot; Ford Hungaria general manager John Pearn told reporters. &quot;However if we cannot resolve these issues, these complications can jeopardise our future,&quot; referring to the tax increase.</p>
<p>Pearn said Ford estimated its outlay for the Szekesfehervar city revenue tax would be several times greater this year than last year due to an increase in turnover and the tripling of the tax to 1.2 percent from January 1997.</p>
<p>About $400,000 from last year's revenues of $100 million were spent on local taxes and this year that sum could rise to more than $2 million from estimated revenues of $170 million.</p>
<p>Regarding the new investment, Pearn said the funds would enable the facility to expand production to include additional coils and fuel pumps, as well as air-fuel charging assemblies and window washer bottles.</p>
<p>Ford Hungaria already builds coils, electric fuel pumps, starter drives and starter motors.</p>
<p>The company, which started operations in May 1992 and is wholly owned by Ford, delivers parts to Ford plants in the Americas and Europe. It recently started shipping parts to Japan to Mazda Motor Corporation, which is owned roughly 30 percent by Ford.</p>
<p>Ford said the new products would help Hungarian operations increase revenue to $230 million in 2000 from $100 million in 1996.</p>
