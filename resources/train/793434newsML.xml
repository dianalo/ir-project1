<p>While Kenya's central bank grapples to shore up a sliding shilling its Tanzanian counterpart faces the opposite dilemma -- unprecedented inflows of foreign exchange, financial analysts and diplomats said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The senior representative for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Tanzania, Festus Osunsade, told Reuters that Tanzania's economic fundamentals were healthy but the central bank needed to carefully manage inflows of foreign exchange, a large portion of which comprised flight capital from Kenya.</p>
<p>&quot;Government finances continue to be healthy. Regarding the monetary situation -- it's an embarassment of riches. Large inflows of foreign exchange in recent weeks show a growing confidence in the Tanzanian economy.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time it offers challenges to manage such inflows in a non-inflationary manner and without permitting an overvalued shilling,&quot; Osunsade said.</p>
<p>A dealer with one leading foreign bank told Reuters that about $3-4 million was being sold every day on the interbank market representing about $10-$12 million more per month than for the same period six months ago. Banking sources said unconfirmed estimates of capital inflows from Kenya range as high as $12 million per week. However, much of the capital flight is said to be arriving through non-official channels.</p>
<p>&quot;What I can say is several people have shown interest in doing business in Tanzania while the Kenyan currency is losing value. We have had inquiries from Nairobi,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Kenyan shilling has dropped sharply since the International Monetary Fund halted its three-year $205 million aid package on July 31 because of Kenya's failure to crack down on corruption.</p>
<p>The Tanzanian shilling is holding its own against a strong dollar, trading at 617.20 to the dollar on Tuesday up from a low of 620 in July. In contrast the Kenyan shilling traded at a record low of 70.48 to the dollar on Tuesday, having lost 1.64 percent of its value on Monday.</p>
<p>Analysts said that Tanzania's continuing tight fiscal policies, although difficult to sell to the electorate, had produced a big improvement in the government's budget.</p>
<p>Growth in gross domestic product rose to 4.2 percent in 1996 compared with 3.9 percent in 1995. The trend is for continuing modest increase in GDP growth but this may now be in jeopardy due to the effects of severe drought on Tanzania's agriculture-dependent economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We fear drought will have a negative impact on GDP growth. The question is -- will growth sectors like mining, tourism and services offset the negative impact of drought?&quot; said one senior financial analyst.</p>
<p>Investment, particularly in the mining sector, has shown strong gains. Tanzania's first gold mine is scheduled to go into production in 1998 with at least one other gold mine opening every year from then until the end of the century.</p>
<p>Tourism prospects are also healthy with record earnings of $322 million from 326,194 visitors in 1996. Tanzania aims to attract 500,000 tourists per year by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Year-on-year inflation, made worse by drought, is  currently hovering around 16 percent but is trending down.</p>
<p>Actual underlying inflation in June was 7.3 percent, compared with 10.3 percent in May.</p>
<p>Tanzania's balance of payments figures saw a deficit of $76.7 million in June compared to $64.5 million the previous month. Export earnings fell 10.6 percent to $42.3 million while imports rose 24.2 percent to $119 million.</p>
<p>The Bank of Tanzania was unmoved by the hike in imports, seeing the rise &quot;as an indication of expansion in investment activities in both the construction and manufacturing sectors.&quot;</p>
<p>A tightening of the taxation dragnet by the government had resulted in revenue collection for June totalling 57.2 billion shillings ($92.7 million), a solid rise on the May figure of 46.3 billion shillings. A value added tax (VAT) is scheduled for introduction on July 1, 1998. Tanzania's total external debt is $7.9 billion.
