<p>New Zealand financial markets confounded pundits by rallying sharply on Monday, the first trading day after the election, mostly out of relief that support for the far left Alliance Party had diminished.</p>
<p>The New Zealand dollar gained half a U.S. cent, share prices rallied close to a 2-1/2 year high and support for the debt markets took interest rates down sharply.</p>
<p>The rally took place despite the fact that the election, the first under the Mixed Member Proportional system of representation, brought an inconclusive result.</p>
<p>Pre-election, Prime Minister Jim Bolger had warned of &quot;Sunday, bloody Sunday&quot; and the &quot;Crash of '97&quot; if New Zealanders voted in a government of the left.</p>
<p>Few commentators shared Bolger's view, but Monday's rally nevertheless came out of the blue.</p>
<p>Bolger's centre-right National Party and its allies won 53 seats against the 50 for the two left-wing parties, Labour and the Alliance, leaving nationalist New Zealand First with 17 seats and the balance of power.</p>
<p>The Winston Peters-led NZ First is expected to start talking soon with prospective coalition partners.</p>
<p>Commentators expect Peters to tie up with the centre-left Labour Party but it may be weeks, possibly months, before New Zealand knows what sort of government emerges.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Bill Birch said markets had acted maturely to Saturday's election and that the poll showed New Zealanders strongly supported the current economic direction.</p>
<p>He later gave an indication of the likely tone of future bargaining by saying widening of the Reserve Bank's zero-to-two percent annual inflation range -- which he has steadfastly defended since its inception -- may well be on the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister Jim Bolger has made it very clear that we want to maintain our broad mix of policies that have performed so well to give us economic growth and a much better performance of the New Zealand economy,&quot; Birch said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>&quot;That's very much a priority for us. That's not to say there would not be some tweaking of those policies.&quot;</p>
<p>The key election outcome for markets was the poor showing of the Alliance, which campaigned on a platform of increased taxation to fund higher welfare spending.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange dealers said the rally in the New Zealand dollar was caused by a seemingly large number of players who went short in the run-up to Saturday's poll.</p>
<p>The Kiwi ended at US$0.6980, up strongly from US$0.6920 at the opening, having traded a gaping 0.6920-0.7003 range.</p>
<p>Strength in the foreign exchange and bond markets quickly flowed through into equities, where the benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 14.93 points higher at 2,264.47.</p>
<p>&quot;In hindsight, there was greater focus on the diminishing support for the very left of the political spectrum, in other words the Alliance Party,&quot; said one dealer, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>But the rally may be short-lived, dealers warned, particularly if a coalition does not crystallize after a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p>&quot;The main feature now is what the two main parties are going to do now to get Winston,&quot; said one other dealer.</p>
