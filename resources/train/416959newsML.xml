<p>Wrist spinners Shane Warne and Michael Bevan hurried Australia to victory over South Africa by an innings and 196 runs in little more than an hour on the final morning of the first test on Tuesday.</p>
<p>South Africa, 302 behind on first innings, collapsed from their overnight 99 for four to 130 all out, losing their last five wickets for three runs in five overs.</p>
<p>It was the first time South Africa had lost by an innings in 33 years, stretching back to the Durban test of 1964-65 when England won by an innings and 104 runs.</p>
<p>The fifth wicket pair of Jacques Kallis and Jonty Rhodes held firm for 10 overs at the start of the day, until Rhodes was trapped lbw by Warne for eight.</p>
<p>Shaun Pollock and Kallis were together for a further six overs before Warne bowled Kallis round his legs for the innings top score of 39, and from that point the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p>Bevan wrapped up the tail with his left-arm spin, snapping up the last four wickets for two runs in his last two overs.</p>
<p>Lance Klusener (0) and Dave Richardson (2) were caught by Matthew Hayden at short leg off the first and sixth balls of Bevan's 14th over, and Allan Donald and Paul Adams were both clean bowled without scoring in his last.</p>
<p>Bevan finished wih four for 32 and Warne four for 43.</p>
