<p>U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross left for Egypt on Saturday to meet President Hosni Mubarak after making no progress in overnight talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on reviving stalled Israeli-PLO peace negotiations.</p>
<p>A U.S. embassy spokesman said Ross flew from Israel to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh on Saturday morning for talks with Mubarak, who has often mediated in troubled rounds of peace talks.</p>
<p>Ross and Arafat raised no hopes of an early breakthrough after their talks to try to end a crisis sparked by Israel's groundbreaking on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still efforts to be carried out by Mr Ross in order to push the peace process forward,&quot; the Palestinian president told reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>Ross acknowledged &quot;differences&quot; remained between Israel and the PLO but said he saw &quot;genuine interest&quot; in overcoming them.</p>
<p>Peace talks between Israel and the PLO collapsed in March when Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu gave the go-ahead for the construction of 6,500 homes for Jews on the East Jerusalem hill called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority cabinet said in a statement that Ross's mission made no headway due to continued construction at the site claimed by both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;The American envoy Dennis Ross did not achieve any progress in his mission with the Israel side as a result of the Israeli government's insistence to continue settlement building in Jabal Abu Ghneim and in other areas,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian leadership reiterated to the U.S. envoy the complete rejection of Israeli settlement activities in Jerusalem and its Judaisation,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The PLO says Israel must freeze settlement construction on lands it captured in the 1967 Middle East war before it will return to the negotiating table. Israel demands a Palestinian Authority crackdown on &quot;terror&quot; as a condition to restart talks.</p>
<p>Ross was due to return to Israel and Palestinian self-ruled areas for further meetings after his talks with Mubarak.</p>
