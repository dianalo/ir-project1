<p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali congratulated U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright on her nomination for U.S. Secretary of State, the United Nations said on Friday.</p>
<p>Her Security Council colleagues did the same shortly after Albright attended a council meeting after returning from Washington where President Bill Clinton announced her candidacy on Thursday.</p>
<p>Although Albright is mainly responsible for Washington's opposing Boutros-Ghali's bid for re-election, the secretary-general telephoned her to say &quot;how happy&quot; he was at her appointment, U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know that Ambassador Albright has been a really passionate supporter of the United Nations and this is a good thing for us,&quot; she said. &quot;So we are very very happy for her and for the United Nations because now we do have a real advocate there.&quot;</p>
<p>In the 15-seat Security Council, its current president, Paolo Fulci of Italy told reporters that &quot;members of the council said that President Clinton could not have picked a stronger, more qualified, energetic and highly talented person to lead American foreign policy into the year 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>Travelling by train from Washington, Albright received a jubilant welcome from her staff at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, across the street from U.N. headquarters.</p>
<p>Beaming, she kissed her deputy, Edward Gnehm and hugged many other staff. The 59-year-old Czech-born Albright will become the first woman ever to hold the post.</p>
