<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Iomega busy on takeover talk.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Buyers lined up for options, mostly calls, on Iomega Corp on Wednesday as the stock rallied on heavy trading.</p>
<p>Traders said takeover rumors were driving the options activity, but that no potential suitors or prices had emerged.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange said it asked the company to issue a public statement to explain the recent runup in its stock price but the company declined.</p>
<p>&quot;The company stated that its policy is not to comment on unusual market activity or rumors,&quot; the NYSE said.  </p>
<p>Iomega shares ended up a point at 20-1/4 after climbing intraday to 21-1/2. Consolidated turnover topped 17.1 million shares. It was the most active issue on the NYSE.</p>
<p>The stock closed at 17-3/8 last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are just some rumors of a possible takeover but no names are floating out there,&quot; said a market maker in Iomega options at the Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>
<p>Iomega options trade on all four U.S. options exchanges.</p>
<p>&quot;Originally this morning they were buying everything,&quot; but action had settled down by midday, the market maker said.  </p>
<p>The market maker in Chicago added that some investors had sold some call positions they had bought late last week.</p>
<p>&quot;There's two-way trade on the 20s and they're still trying to buy the 22-1/2s,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said activity was centered on the June options, but that some investors were busy in the August series.</p>
<p>A trader at the Pacific Exchange said buyers of Iomega options were fairly busy on that exchange as well.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell you if it has to do with unusual activity or the stock move,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Whenever the underlying shares move above 20, he said, the options become busier &quot;and that's what happened here.&quot;</p>
<p>At the CBOE, the Iomega June 20 call was most active, with turnover of about 6,740 contracts. The June 22-1/2 call traded about 1,750 and the August 20s traded 1,115.</p>
<p>Among puts, the most active was the June 20, which traded more than 1,600 contracts.</p>
<p>Most Iomega options traded on the American Stock Exchange, where about 8,620 of the June 20 calls changed hands, 4,600 of the June 22-1/2s and 3,480 of the July 22-1/2s.</p>
<p>The June 20 put traded 2,055.  </p>
<p>The market maker in Chicago added that implied volatility in Iomega options had risen six to seven points since late last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatility popped to about 65,&quot; he said. &quot;It was down as low as 50 early last week.&quot;</p>
