<p>It's no wonder why the U.S. Treasury market is so confused over what the Federal Reserve will do -- or won't do -- at Tuesday's policy-setting meeting.</p>
<p>Just take a look at the various surveys available, and it reminds you of the array of headlines that graced the newswires and newspapers after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's speech in New York on May 8.  </p>
<p>If you are fortunate to have all major news wire services plus access to the Internet, then you could have come across more than a dozen polls that try to gauge market sentiment on what the Fed will do.</p>
<p>Joseph Liro, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp, suggested there were just too many surveys out there.</p>
<p>On journalists calling him almost every day, he said: &quot;I started polling the reporters for their call on what the Fed would do.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, reporters are neutral and objective and are not permitted to express their opinions on Fed policy.  </p>
<p>So, the press asks the experts -- or those who are perceived to be the experts.</p>
<p>In a Reuters random survey of nine popular polls, conclusions on monetary policy vary, with some showing the majority of respondents leaning towards a rate hike, while the others show sentiment in favor of no move. Ironically, most of the polls were released late last week or on Monday.</p>
<p>There was even some discrepancy between four surveys of the 39 primary dealerships. In the Reuters version, released Monday, economists at 21 of the 39 dealers expected the Fed to leave rates alone, with the other 18 forecasting a rate hike.  </p>
<p>On Friday, Bloomberg Business News reported that 20 dealers predicted no move, while 19 anticipated a 25-basis-point hike, and Market News Service Inc reported 17 dealers forecast a rate hike, with 22 saying no move.</p>
<p>Four days -- and lots of key data -- earlier, Dow Jones' survey found 24 of the 39 dealers predicted a rate hike.</p>
<p>&quot;The probability of the Fed taking action was shaped on a daily basis,&quot; noted William Sullivan, director of money markets research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;A poll a week ago won't provide you with the same reults.&quot;  </p>
<p>Indeed, after Greenspan's speech 10 days ago, a number of analysts changed their minds. Others -- like economists at Goldman, Sachs and Co Inc and J.P. Morgan and Co Inc -- changed their votes to no move in May after economic data during the week were mostly on the weak side.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, MCM MoneyWatch Inc's survey found 75 percent of fund managers predicting a rate hike, while MMS International's poll of 29 economists and traders showed 55 percent forecasting a rate hike and CNNfn's survey of 20 economists found an 11-9 edge in favor of a rate hike. A Reid Thunberg poll showed 36 percent of the 55 polled institutional investors forecasting no rate hike. These surveys were released on Friday.  </p>
<p>What do real people think? An ongoing MSNBC poll of more than 2,500 readers of the Commerce section on the Internet showed that 52 percent of those participating believed the Fed would hike rates a quarter-point, while 42.5 percent voted for steady policy.</p>
<p>And those denizens at the Fed? The market confusion must leave them grinning from ear to ear.  </p>
