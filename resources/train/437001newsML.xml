<p>Ireland's first woman head of state, president Mary Robinson, whose 1990 election broke new ground in a system where men had always held power, said on Wednesday she will not run for a second term in office.</p>
<p>Just after midday on Wednesday Robinson informed Irish prime minister John Bruton that she had decided not to run for a second seven-year term of office. She said it had been a difficult decision but the time had come to consider the future.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a sense of fulfilment in the position I hold now but I have a clear commitment to human rights and would like to continue in that area,&quot; Robinson told Irish radio RTE.</p>
<p>A lawyer and noted orator, Robinson has acquired a high profile internationally, espousing a deep concern for human rights and knowledge of Third World development issues.</p>
<p>On the local stage a number of local high profile names have been mentioned as possible successors for the Irish presidency post including former prime ministers Charlie Haughey and Albert Reynolds.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland's John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), has become one of the best known spokesmen for moderate nationalism at home and abroad and is believed to be a popular cross-party choice.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Republic's political parties decided they wanted to avoid an election and instead choose a candidate that they might unite around, then it would be Hume,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>However the position is regarded as prestige post for long serving politicians in the Republic and may be seen as too important to just give away.</p>
<p>Robinson, during her term in office, injected new vibrancy in the presidency, refusing to follow in the track of earlier incumbents who were rarely seen and never heard.</p>
<p>A highly popular president she kept a light burning at a window of her presidential home in the capital's Phoenix Park as a beacon to the &quot;new Ireland&quot; she championed.</p>
<p>Robinson's election as president ushered in a new era for a role that hitherto had been non-controversial, divorced from the ordinary people and kept behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Throwing open the doors of &quot;Aras an Uachtarain&quot;, her state residence, she promoted &quot;an inclusive Ireland&quot; that sought to recognise the achievements and aspirations of groups that previously had been sidelined or silenced.</p>
<p>Minority groups, womens' and community associations, young people, Irish exiles and crucially, ordinary Protestants and Catholics from beleaguered British Northern Ireland -- which she visited frequently -- were all made welcome.</p>
<p>She overcame odds of 1,000-1 in the male-dominated world of Irish politics to win the 1990 presidential election and become the country's first woman head of state.</p>
<p>Once named &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in seaside Mayo where she was born in 1944, Robinson become Ireland's best ambassador.</p>
<p>She was an indefatigable globe-trotting traveller, clutching the hands of Somali famine victims, grieving for young boys killed by an IRA bomb, chatting with President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>In May 1993 she met Queen Elizabeth, bridging seven centuries of mutual mistrust between Ireland and its former colonial master.</p>
<p>In June 1966 she travelled to Britain to meet the monarch again on the first ever official visit by an Irish president to its nearest neighbour. The visit reflected rapidly improved Anglo-Irish relations resulting from a joint-governmental bid to resolve years of conflict over Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The visits underscored how Robinson, aware of the constitutional limitations of her job as a figurehead president, could make effective use of symbolism.</p>
<p>In a fiercely conservative and predominantly Roman Catholic land with some of the most draconian social laws in Europe, she has invited homosexuals and lesbians to her Dublin residence.</p>
<p>She reached out a hand of friendship across the border to both sides of the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland where 3,200 people died in a 25-year conflict.</p>
<p>Robinson, an internationally respected civil rights lawyer backed by a coalition of left wing groups, defeated the mighty Fianna Fail (Soldiers of Destiny) party in the election.</p>
<p>A member of the inner circle of former prime minister and Fianna Fail leader Albert Reynolds paid her the ultimate compliment, telling the Irish Times: &quot;The woman has the job and she's playing a blinder. She is the best ambassador we have got.&quot;</p>
