<headline>FOCUS - Spain unions table fresh offer to secure deal.</headline>

<p>Spanish unions presented a new proposal to employers on Wednesday that could secure a deal on labour reforms before the government loses patience and imposes its own measures.</p>
<p>After a five-day break in talks, unions and employers resumed negotiations, eager to reach a prompt deal aimed at suppressing Spain's towering unemployment -- the highest in Europe at just under 22 percent.</p>
<p>Employers welcomed the unions' new offer and said the two sides were getting closer to an agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears to be an interesting proposal,&quot; Jose Maria Cuevas, head of the employers' association (CEOE) told reporters ahead of the talks.</p>
<p>Unions said they had proposed a new contract which met their demands for greater stability and sought to placate employers with lower dismissal costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Our offer demonstrates our willingness to risk the maximum to defend the people who are unemployed,&quot; said Antonio Gutierrez, leader of the Workers' Commissions union (CCOO).</p>
<p>Employers said talks would now centre on the new proposal but the &quot;cherry on the cake&quot; would lie in severance pay.</p>
<p>&quot;If (unions) think that it is along these lines that we can succed in reaching a deal, then we must proceed in that direction,&quot; Cuevas said.</p>
<p>The government has given unions and employers until early March to reach a deal before it steps in and forces an accord. But aware of the prickly nature of the issues, it has said it would be tolerant for the timebeing.</p>
<p>&quot;Only when talks have completely broken down will the government directly intervene,&quot; Labour Minister Javier Arenas told a conference earlier this week.</p>
<p>Unions and employers reached a deadlock last Thursday over the key issue of contracts for young people.</p>
<p>Employers offered a new contract for under 27s which allowed for severance pay of 20 days per year worked.</p>
<p>But unions were not happy, and the two sides temporarily broke off talks to chew over the new proposals.</p>
<p>Now unions have come back with an offer not far from that presented by employers last week.</p>
<p>They are proposing a permanent contract that would provide severance pay for fair dismissal of 20 days for each year worked, with a maximum of 12 months.</p>
<p>In the event of unfair dismissal, the cost would be higher. While the exact figure remains vague, unions said it would be below the current 45 days per year, with a maximum of 42 months.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure (for unfair dismissal) must be far enough away from the 42 months so that employers have some incentive to employ people on permanent contracts,&quot; Candido Mendez, leader of the General Workers' union (UGT), told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But it has to be sufficiently greater that 12 months so that...employers are dissuaded from firing.&quot;</p>
<p>Employers are keen to see dismissal costs cut. They complain Spain's severance pay is by far the highest in the European Union and dissuades them from hiring staff.</p>
<p>Unions, meanwhile, want to see the creation of a more secure contract, especially for youths who suffer most from unemployment in Spain.</p>
<p>While an unofficial deadline for an accord passed last week,</p>
