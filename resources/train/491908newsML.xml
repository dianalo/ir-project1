<headline>Kirkuk winning April Med battle, faces tougher May.</headline>

<p>Iraq's Kirkuk crude oil could face tough competition from Urals in May but may well get the better of its Russian rival in the short term, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>An improvement in refinery margins and a firm contango in prices should keep Mediterranean demand healthy for Kirkuk, loaded from the Turkish port of Ceyhan, in the next week or two.</p>
<p>But a fall in the Urals price in the run-up to May resulting from a rise in Mediterranean sour supply would likely squeeze Kirkuk painfully -- unless the United Nations could be persuaded to allow another adjustment in Iraqi pricing, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term, with Urals anywhere above Dated -$1.50 or $1.60, Kirkuk is good value and people will lift on term,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But with Urals any lower Kirkuk is in trouble. And in May there will be plenty of oil around.&quot;</p>
<p>Urals was valued around Dated Brent -$1.40 a barrel, cif Augusta, on Friday.</p>
<p>Iraq is currently selling oil in the second 90-day period of its six-month oil-for-food deal, which started on December 10 and will end on June 7.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Iraq is allowed to sell $2 billion worth of crude over six months to buy food and medicine for Iraqis suffering under sanctions imposed in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Kirkuk for sale into Europe in May will be priced at Dated Brent less $2.20 a barrel, a 30-cent cut from April.</p>
<p>At that level traders see Kirkuk easily finding homes in preference to Urals at current levels of Dated -$1.40.</p>
<p>Kirkuk's May level represents a notional price differential to Urals of around 80 cents, a substantial erosion of around 50 percent in Urals' recent price competitiveness.</p>
<p>But Kirkuk's April loading programme of an initial 430,000 barrels per day (bpd) is a substantial 35-40 percent increase from around 310,000 bpd in February and March and could easily go higher.</p>
<p>And in late April, Urals' May programme will be looming on the horizon, in contrast to the current situation where Urals cargoes are available but not plentiful.</p>
<p>&quot;Kirkuk will have a fairly smooth run from the contango and increased refinery offtake until we go beyond around May 5,&quot; a trader said. &quot;But once we start selling Urals in the third decade of April for barrels loading in early May the market will come off. Frankly I see Urals in June down to Dated -$1.90.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kirkuk price cut was made possible by an equivalent reduction for May in the European price of Saudi Arab Light.</p>
<p>Kirkuk is priced against Arab light cent-for-cent under arrangements established by the United Nations as part of the oil-for-food programme.</p>
<p>Other analysts say Kirkuk and fellow Iraqi crude Basrah will feel some benefit from rising global demand as refineries come out of spring maintenance.</p>
<p>&quot;By end-April we'll have seen the low point in refinery demand,&quot; an oil analyst said. &quot;European maintenance equivalent to around one million bpd will be coming to an end by May.&quot;</p>
<p>In Asia between 1.7 million and two million bpd of capacity will be in turnaround in May and June, but since Asian buying of Middle East crude has a two-month delivery window, demand for July will already be feeding through this month, analysts say.</p>
<p>More support could arise from uncertainty about whether a second six months of oil-for-food will be approved by the U.N. Security Council. &quot;If there is any doubt then there could be some tightness,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>At current prices, Iraq would earn up to $950 million in the second 90 days if it pumps around 430,000 bpd of Kirkuk and 300,000 bpd of Basrah in April and May, according to industry estimates.</p>
<p>But a further threat to Kirkuk comes indirectly from its present pricing structure -- Baghdad may react to the prospect of weaker May prices by selling more to meet its cash target, and by doing so help weaken the market further.</p>
<p>Brent crude lost another 50 cents a barrel on Friday, extending its three-month slide to over $7. Dated Brent was worth around $16.78 a barrel, its lowest level in over 12 months.</p>
<p>As long as Iraq must operate under a revenue ceiling in a weak market, sales increases are likely to chase falling prices in a vicious circle that squeezes value out of the barrel.</p>
