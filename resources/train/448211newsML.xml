<p>Belgian shares ended lower on Monday and dealers said more losses could come if U.S. financial markets remained weak overnight.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 index lost 21.93 points, or 1.00 percent, to end at 2,170.95 points, its lowest level since March 5, as European stock markets slid in parallel with bond markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We might expect to have another decline (on Tuesday),&quot; one trader said, noting other European markets extended their losses after Brussels closed at 1530 GMT in reaction to a weak start in New York. At 1615 GMT the Dow was down more than 50 points.</p>
<p>The trigger for Monday's losses was a sell-off in German Bunds as fears about a fudging of the Maastricht Treaty criteria were fuelled by a comment in Brussels by German Finance Minister Theo Waigel. Waigel, speaking at a meeting of EU finance chiefs, said the Maastricht Treaty criteria could be interpreted flexibly to take account of special circumstances, apparently contradicting his own previous insistence on a &quot;strict&quot; reading.</p>
<p>Belgian traders noted, however, that financial issues weathered the bond market weakness well, and losses were more evident in industrial issues. Only Kredietbank stood out, slipping 1.89 percent to 12,950 francs.</p>
<p>Insurer Royale Belge, helped by speculation about a merger with units of the AXA-UAP group added another 2.34 percent to Friday's 4.2 percent gain to close at 9,200 francs. Generale Bank ended unchanged, while Bank Bruxelles Lambert slipped just 10 francs to 8,310.</p>
<p>Industrials lost more. Cement maker CBR, which left analysts mixed on its 1996 results last week, lost 65 francs or 1.91 percent to 3,345 francs.</p>
<p>Retailer GIB slipped 1.89 percent to 1,555 francs. GIB fast food unit Quick lost 3.31 percent to 1,750 francs after briefly touching a new year low at 1,740 francs.</p>
<p>One trader said there was nothing fundamental behind the drop, just a lack of market belief in the group's management following a string of disappointing news in 1996.</p>
<p>Traders said, however, that electricity utility Electrabel which ended 60 francs lower at 7,970 francs on Monday could rise again on confirmation its steady dividend policy had been maintained.</p>
<p>After the close of trade Electrabel announced 1996 earnings rose six percent to 30.4 billion francs and that it would raise its net dividend four percent to 352 francs, giving a dividend yield over four percent.</p>
