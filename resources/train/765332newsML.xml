<headline>Bethlehem Steel tops Q2 expectations.</headline>
<dateline>BETHLEHEM, Pa. 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bethlehem Steel Corp Wednesday reported better than expected second quarter profits citing successful implementation of its business plan.</p>
<p>Excluding a $1.01 per share gain on the sale of its equity interest in Iron Ore Co of Canada, Bethlehem earned $0.32 per share in the latest quarter, compared with $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Sales for the second quarter of 1997 were $1.21 billion, compared with $1.24 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company said U.S. industry steel shipments in 1997 should be 100 million tons.  </p>
<p>Noting about the same volume was shipped in 1996, Bethlehem said its outlook is based on its belief the domestic economy will continue on a course of moderate and sustainable growth and low inflation and the global economy will continue to strengthen during the balance of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand from the major steel-consuming sectors continues to be relatively good,&quot; it pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to make steady progress,&quot; said chief executive Curtis Barnette.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are successfully executing our business plans, implementing our restructuring plans, eliminating the significant losses of the restructured businesses, and rebuilding our financial strength.</p>
<p>&quot;During the first six months of this year we contributed $265 million to our pension trust,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>&quot;These contributions have helped us reduce our pension liability to $685 million,&quot; he said, noting it was $1.6 billion at the end of 1993.  &quot;We plan to make additional contributions during the year.&quot;  </p>
<p>The company said Basic Steel Operations had second quarter income from operations of $77 million, excluding the effects of the gain from the sale of Iron Ore Co, compared with $53 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Results for the quarter improved from a year ago principally due to improved costs as a result of our restructuring plans and higher realized prices,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Shipments of 2,238,000 tons in the latest quarter &quot;were lower than the 2,315,000 tons shipped in the second quarter of 1996 as a result of exiting Bethlehem Structural, it said.  </p>
<p>Second quarter 1997 income from operations improved over the first quarter due to lower costs at Bethlehem Structural and higher shipments at its three core businesses of Burns Harbor, Sparrows Point and Pennsylvania Steel Technologies.</p>
<p>The Steel Related Operations segment reported losses from operations of $10 million for the second quarter, compared with losses of $8 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;As part of our restructuring plans, we continue to negotiate the sales of these businesses,&quot; Bethlehem said.</p>
<p>Cash provided from operating activities for the first six months of 1997 was $271 million.  </p>
<p>That compared with $181 million a year earlier. The Iron Ore Co sale resulted in cash proceeds of $145 million.</p>
<p>Principal uses of cash during the first six months of 1997 included capital expenditures and pension funding.  Capital expenditures were $116 million for the first six months of 1997, compared with $137 million during the year-earlier period.  Capital expenditures are currently expected to be about $270 million in 1997, versus $259 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Principal uses of cash during the remainder of 1997 include capital expenditures, additional pension funding, and the repayment of debt and capital lease obligations.</p>
<p>In June, Bethlehem said, the company amended its existing non-reducing credit arrangement with 13 banks, extending the term by about two years, through September 12, 2002, and increasing the size by $25 million to $525 million.</p>
<p>The amended arrangement consists of a $300 million receivables purchase agreement and a $225 million inventory credit agreement.  At June 30, funds available under bank credit arrangements totaled $363 million, it said.</p>
<p>The company said directors declared regular dividends on its three preferred stocks and again ommitted the common stock dividend, which was last paid in December 1991.</p>
