<title>USA: CSCE world sugar ends barely down, still in range.</title>
<headline>CSCE world sugar ends barely down, still in range.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-02</dateline>

<p>CSCE world sugar futures closed weaker after failing to pierce resistance and the recent high of 11.04 cents in May, dealers said.</p>
<p>Trade selling above 11.00 cents kept resistance intact despite steady speculative buying throughout the day. The buying supported the second-position July contract, which closed only 0.02 lower at 10.70 cents, dealers said.</p>
<p>May ended 0.04 cent lower at 10.96 cents per lb, having ranged from 11.04 to 10.92 cents. The back months settled 0.01 higher to 0.02 weaker.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 15,915 lots compared to Tuesday's official 17,679 lots.</p>
<p>Despite today's losses, the market remains near the top of its trading range. Speculative buying could hold prices steady but liquidation ahead of the May expiry would prompt further losses, traders said.</p>
<p>The last trading day for the spot month is April 30.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a tough call right now but if I were forced to guess, it's going lower,&quot; a floor source said. A move under 10.90 basis July could speed up losses, he added.</p>
<p>Nearby support was pegged at Tuesday's low of 10.78 cents basis May.</p>
<p>Open interest in May rose 1,496 lots to 59,947 lots, as of Tuesday's close.</p>
