<title>HONG KONG: ASIAN DEBT MARKETS - Mandates in the making.</title>
<headline>ASIAN DEBT MARKETS - Mandates in the making.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-01-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asian debt markets had a lot to offer on Monday despite a dearth of new launches.</p>
<p>Mandates are starting to dribble in for the first South Korean bank deals of the year, bankers said.</p>
<p>A-2 rated Shinhan Bank has given a verbal go-ahead to Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and HSBC Markets to arrange a US$200 million floating rate note issue, sources close to the deal said.</p>
<p>As mandated, the deal would have a coupon of 12.5 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate and an all-in return of 17.5 basis points with fees.</p>
<p>Bankers said the pricing is very tight, especially with Korean markets unsettled by this month's labour strikes and recent bad news on the financial front.</p>
<p>The Korean stock market has slumped following revelations last week that Hanbo Steel, South Korea's 14th largest conglomerate, and two of its affiliates had defaulted on debt payments totalling 131.1 billion won ($153.2 million).</p>
<p>The Hanbo crisis also is weighing on outstanding issues of Korean bank floating rate notes and certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>&quot;The top-tier issues really haven't been hit very hard, but the bottom tier has seen a more substantial move,&quot; said a syndicate manager at a U.S. bank.</p>
<p>But while prices have been dropping as bids disappear, actual trade has been scant, he said.</p>
<p>There is talk that Shinhan Bank is being pressured to be more generous and accept a wider spread of around 23 basis points.</p>
<p>Cho Hung Bank reportedly has given a mandate to two U.S. banks to arrange a 10-year subordinated step-up bond issue. The deal reportedly pays 67-68 basis points to the call in year five.</p>
<p>Korea Electric Power (KEPCO) is pegged to be one of the next Asian borrowers to tap the U.S. Yankee market, with a bond expected this week via Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Korea Development Bank on Monday went for a 30 billion yen dual currency yen/dollar samurai bond on Monday.</p>
<p>A number of China's institutions will borrow abroad this year, according to a State Administration of Foreign Exchange official quoted in the China Daily Business Weekly on Sunday.</p>
<p>In addition to State Development Bank, which is expected to launch its Yankee this week, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China are planning issues, the official said.</p>
<p>The official said that while Japanese markets would remain the focus of Chinese institutions issuing bonds this year, borrowers also would look at the U.S., Hong Kong, Singapore and European markets.</p>
<p>Bankers said Thai banks are expected to be the next borrowers to take the leap into Australia's Kangaroo market. They said bonds could be in the offing for Thai Farmers Bank and Bangkok Bank. Mandates are expected shortly.</p>
<p>Thailand's Siam Commercial Bank said today it planned to secure long-term debt worth 8.75 billion baht and set up a medium term notes programme worth US$1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Sources said investment banks are expected finish presenting their bond issue ideas to the Philippines on Tuesday and that an announcement on a mandate could come soon.</p>
