<p>Australian grain prices continued to fall heavily last week as markets grimly celebrated the big world crop and traders looked for further price declines.</p>
<p>Cash wheat prices fell by up to A$15.00 a tonne for the benchmark Australian Standard White (ASW), and while futures prices fell less than this the prospect at week's end was for a continued market slide.  </p>
<p>Australian wheat prices have now fallen by more than A$40.00 a tonne in the last three months as Australia consolidated its own big 1996/97 grain crop and as an expected poor crop in the U.S. and elsewhere gradually emerged much bigger than thought.</p>
<p>Futures broker Ben Suttie of C, A &amp; L Bell Commodities said A$120.00 a tonne for January 1997 futures was now a prospect, against the contract's Friday settlement close of A$163.50.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're (prices are) going to weaken as we go into harvest. We've got a huge crop out there. Bar a frost the crop's going to be huge,&quot; he said. &quot;(Cash) ASW delivered Newcastle (on Friday was) A$155.00 offer - A$120 here we come.&quot;  </p>
<p>Guy Allen of GrainCorp saw last week's Australian market fall as largely reflecting Australian concern over European export subsidies.</p>
<p>Rain toward the end of the week in wheatgrowing areas added to the bearish news, he said.</p>
<p>End users were still not coming to the market, he said.</p>
<p>Peter Howard of New England Agricultural Traders described last week's market as an &quot;absolute capitulation&quot; and as having turned &quot;extremely ugly&quot;.  </p>
<p>Feed barley had lost A$20 a tonne over the past two weeks to reach a bidding quote of A$114.00 a tonne on Friday, while the wheat market had virtually dried up with no farmers considering selling at present prices, Howard said.</p>
<p>The sorghum market in the past week was also very thin, with old crop down A$10.00-A$12.00 to A$170 delivered Newcastle and the new crop down to about A$152.00.</p>
<p>Some signs were emerging of consumer buying in the U.S., but the market continued to drop.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it will flop about for months,&quot; Howard said, adding that chartists were still bearish.  </p>
<p>The next main event on Australia's wheat market calendar is the Australian Wheat Board's pool price revision, expected on Monday.</p>
<p>Allen said the trade expected a cut for ASW of A$5.00-A$15.00 a tonne, with the best bet A$10.00.</p>
<p>Suttie said pool prices were expected to be down by another A$5.00-A$10.00 after the last price cut, of A$10.00 a tonne on September 10 to A$205.00 a tonne for ASW.</p>
<p>Suttie pointed out that the ASW pool price, at A$205.00, less A$27.00 duty into store, stood at a net A$178, while at A$155.00 cash wheat was A$20-A$23 less than the pool.  </p>
<p>The AWB's indicative price for new crop ASW wheat delivered Newcastle fell by A$15.00 to A$158.00 over the week.</p>
<p>Australian wheat futures mostly fell over the week, especially toward weekend.</p>
<p>The January 1997 contract settlement price fell to A$163.50 on Friday from Monday's close of A$168.50.</p>
<p>A slightly more active week on the SFE produced 149 futures contract trades, while 20 call options and 10 put options traded.</p>
