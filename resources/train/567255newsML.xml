<p>Imperial Chemical Industries Plc said on Wednesday it expected the speciality chemicals businesses it bought from Unilever to outstrip their recent sales growth rate of six to seven percent per year.</p>
<p>&quot;We see significant upside (for sales),&quot; chairman Sir Ronald Hampel told a news conference. &quot;I'd be very disappointed if we don't see a faster sales growth rate than the six to seven percent per annum seen recently.&quot;  </p>
<p>Hampel added that the units had sizeable scope for new sales to Procter &amp; Gamble Co, a U.S. rival of Unilever's.</p>
<p>He said the deal should help improve the overall group's results as well as provide a better share price performance for shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm dead certain the next five years will be better,&quot; Hampel said.</p>
<p>Chief executive Charles Miller Smith summed up the $8.0 billion deal by saying, &quot;The purchase will create a formidable force in speciality chemicals, with less cyclical earnings, lower capital intensity and new delivery vehicles for technology.&quot;</p>
<p>ICI also said it planned further acquisitions, but noted that future buys would probably not be as big as the speciality chemicals deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The character and nature of future acquisitions will be incremental,&quot; Miller Smith said.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly in my time as chief executive, I doubt there will be another acquisition of this magnitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Any future acquisitions should be assisted by the fact that the speciality chemicals units are all cash-generative, company officials said.</p>
<p>The units generated $1.0 billion of cash over the past three years, despite making annual capital expenditure of $200 million per annum.  </p>
<p>Miller Smith, who worked at Unilever for 10 years before joining ICI, said the acquisition would foster &quot;an international and entrepreneurial culture&quot; at ICI.</p>
<p>&quot;Millbank (ICI headquarters) will not be the same going forward -- we will have Brits, tough-minded Americans and gritty Dutchmen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Regarding the company's debt, group finance director Alan Spall said, &quot;The interest coupon on the acquisition financing, which is a five-year facility, will be transferred into a blend of currencies, but is locked in at an amalgam rate which is below 7.5 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>ICI expected to complete the acquisiton of the units -- which include National Starch and Chemical Co, Quest International, Unichema International and Crosfield -- in the middle of this year. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
