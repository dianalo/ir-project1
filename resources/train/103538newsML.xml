<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe told parliament on Tuesday he had ordered a policy of &quot;greater firmness&quot; towards separatist violence in Corsica and called for a national mobilisation to fight terrorism.</p>
<p>Speaking three days after Corsican militants set off a bomb at his mayoral office in Bordeaux, Juppe said: &quot;With the full approval of the president, I have renewed orders of greater firmness to the interior and justice ministers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To defeat this curse of violence and terrorism, the only effective remedy is the mobilisation, solidarity and cohesion of all of us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Juppe said the main hardline separatist group, the Historic Wing of the Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC), had rejected his offer of dialogue and chosen &quot;radicalisation&quot;.</p>
<p>Reinforcement of police and justice investigators in Corsica had already yielded first results, with more than 20 bomb suspects arrested, and the government would stick to its course.</p>
<p>At the same time, Juppe vowed to pursue a generous policy of economic, social and cultural development on the poor Medterranean island, which suffers from higher unemployment and a lower average income than mainland France.</p>
<p>The prime minister said he was convinced that the vast majority of Corsicans wanted peace and quiet to enable the economic development of their region.</p>
