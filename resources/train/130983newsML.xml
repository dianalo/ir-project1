<p>European grain firms have taken up export licences for 100,000 tonnes of wheat to a target group of African importing countries, subsidised at 12 Ecus per tonne and valid until the end of February, French grain officials said.</p>
<p>The licences were booked on Friday and Monday after the European Union announced on Thursday a fixed refund of 12 Ecus per tonne for a group of African nations needing special aid.</p>
<p>They fall under an EU scheme to offer licences through its daily export channel and which are valid for the standard current month plus four months, the officials said.  </p>
<p>The list of destinations targeted by the refunds -- which are some five Ecus over latest ordinary refunds -- has not been published, but French officials said 38 countries were involved.</p>
<p>Nigeria, a traditional destination for the United States, is excluded.</p>
<p>The European Commission has three working days to use right of veto over the licence applications.</p>
<p>Officials had no details on the progress of a second targeted export scheme, which allows licences to remain valid until the end of the season on June 30 next year.</p>
<p>This regime is drawn up on so-called Article Nine provisions which force traders to show contracts before getting licences.</p>
<p>The special refunds of 12 Ecus per tonne will be upgraded to 19 Ecus per tonne from January through a procedure known as a positive corrective, EU officials said last week.</p>
