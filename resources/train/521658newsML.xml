<title>SPAIN: Repsol retail share offer 30 times overbid.</title>
<headline>Repsol retail share offer 30 times overbid.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The offer of shares in Spain's Repsol was oversubscribed roughly 30 times on the retail tranche by close of business on Thursday, sources close to the operation said on Friday.</p>
<p>The government is selling its last 10.0 percent stake in the energy blue chip this month, to leave it fully privatised.</p>
<p>The period for provisional share orders from small investors ends on Monday April 21, at 1200 GMT. Irrevocable share orders can be made from April 22-25.</p>
<p>The maximum offer price will be fixed after the close on Monday. Energy analysts see the maximum offer price being set below a current high for the listed shares of 6,280 pesetas, but still at the upper end of its recent range.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT, Repsol was up 10 pesetas to 6,280, while the Ibex-35 blue chip index fell 0.19 percent to 5,618.82.</p>
<p>&quot;When the final price is set (on April 28) the managers will want it to appear to be a bargain, so they're doing the classic thing of running the price up before the maximum price is set (on April 21) and then letting it fall off slightly before the final price is set,&quot; said an energy analyst who requested anonymity.</p>
<p>The final share price is calculated on the basis of its traded price on April 28, with a discount of four percent.</p>
<p>However, the analyst added that the offer price will not be too far below 6,200 pesetas, because demand for the shares has been very strong and the company's prospects are bright.</p>
<p>The stock should end the year above 7,000 pesetas, he said.</p>
<p>An analyst at Madrid brokerage Betacapital agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;Repsol has good chances of finishing the year with a share price of 7,500 pesetas. In any case the share offer is seeing a lot of interest because it's pretty small, it's retail concentrated and there's a four percent discount,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Most of the shares are being offered to small Spanish shareholders, with 12.75 million shares available to the public and 4.5 million shares reserved for Repsol employees.</p>
<p>The remaining 10.2 million shares in the initial offering are being sold to institutions.</p>
