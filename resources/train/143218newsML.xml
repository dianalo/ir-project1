<title>RUSSIA: Russian shares close mixed, seen fluctuating.</title>
<headline>Russian shares close mixed, seen fluctuating.</headline>

<p>Leading Russian shares closed mixed on Friday as investors grew disheartened by news that the International Monetary Fund had delayed the release of the next tranche of its $10 billion loan to Moscow, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders forecast market fluctuations in the next few days against a general downward trend.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 24 shares fell by 3.13 percent to 179.49 on $20.64 million in volume.</p>
<p>Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said he was confident Russia would get all IMF tranches due in 1997 - but the bank said recent talks had not been conclusive and would continue next month.</p>
<p>Andrei Ippolitov, corporate securities director at IK Prospekt, said Dubinin's confidence had not heartened investors.</p>
<p>&quot;So what if he says this -- investors are selling anyway,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said many short-term investors preferred to sell before President Boris Yeltsin's heart operation, scheduled for mid-November.</p>
<p>Traders gave mixed opinions on the market impact of Moscow telephone company MGTS choosing Salomon Brothers to lead its Eurobond issue.</p>
<p>&quot;This is definitely the type of news investors are very keen on and see in a very positive way -- it will speed the road for other companies to issue Eurobonds,&quot; said Victor Pitaleff, a trader at Renaissance Capital.</p>
<p>But Ippolitov said the Eurobond would not help the share as its price per lines ratio was too high.</p>
<p>MGTS, which has not been traded since Monday, rose to $600.0 from $580.0 in late trading.</p>
<p>Investors were not at all encouraged by news that a new Surgutneftegaz share issue acquired by Surgut Holding would not reach the market.</p>
<p>Traders said the fact that Surgut Holding was acquiring the paper had raised questions about corporate governance in Russia and relations between management and shareholders.</p>
<p>Surgutneftegaz was traded at $0.396 after $0.425 at Thursday's close, Mosenergo fell to $0.950 from $0.954, LUKoil edged down to $9.92 from $10.20 and Irkutsnergo rose to $0.106 from $0.10.</p>
