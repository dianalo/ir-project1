<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures were expected to open little changed Monday morning, in line with early over-the-counter trade, industry sources said.</p>
<p>September OTC quotes this morning in the $2.43-2.435 area were straddling September future's close Friday at $2.432.</p>
<p>While traders said the screen may garner some support from the cash, which was still quoted above paper in the $2.50 area at Henry Hub, they said forecasts this week for fairly mild weather should temper the bulls.</p>
<p>Early Henry Hub cash quotes were down slightly from Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of any size (in the cash) has traded. People are playing it close to the vest this morning,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Technical traders still pegged September resistance at $2.55 and then at the contract high and double top at $2.605. Further selling was likely in the $2.64-2.655 spot continuation chart gap from late January. Support was seen at Friday's low of $2.395, then at $2.34 and $2.30, with better buying likely in the $2.25-2.27 area.</p>
<p>In the cash Friday, Gulf Coast weekend prices slipped slightly to about the $2.50 level. Midcon pipes were steady to modestly lower in the low-$2.40s. New York city gate gas was little changed in the mid-$2.70s.</p>
