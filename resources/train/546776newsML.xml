<p>Indonesia's unlisted Bakrie group planned to put its property projects under property firm PT Elang Realty and change Elang's name to Bakrie Land, a top official of the group said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Eddi J. Soebari, vice-president of Bakrie Capital Investindo, a holding company of the Bakrie group which took a 70 percent interest in Elang in March, said Bakrie Land would become a sub-holding of the Bakrie group with Bakrie Capital Indonesia as the holding company.</p>
<p>&quot;The main objective is to change the name of Elang to Bakrie Land, and put all Bakrie's property projects in Bakrie Land,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Soebari said the group's plans also included increasing the paid-up capital of Elang Realty through a rights issue which would be discussed at an extraordinary general meeting on May 9.</p>
<p>Trading in Elang was briefly suspended on the Jakarta stock market on Tuesday after its shares fell 30.43 percent in the first 90 minutes of trading.</p>
<p>The exchange later said it had found no irregularities and trading resumed in the early afternoon. Elang was the most active counter of the day, closing down 300 rupiah at 1,425 on a turnover of 108 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no corporate action which is not known by the public,&quot; Soebari said.</p>
<p>He said Elang's property projects included Aquila hotels, a housing estate, office building Menara Kuningan, and the Aquila recreational estate in West Java.</p>
<p>The Bakrie group currently operates Bali Nirwana Resort, apartment complex Taman Rasuna Said and office building Menara Nusa in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Soebari declined to give further details about the rights issue and the group's other plans.</p>
