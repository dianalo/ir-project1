<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Friday that German economic recovery was gathering pace and Bonn would fulfil the convergence criteria to qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;For me it is clear: Germany will fulfil the criteria. The euro will come at the agreed time,&quot; Kohl told Bonn journalists at his traditional twice-yearly news conference.</p>
<p>Kohl said the German economy was picking up speed and stuck by the official forecast of 2-1/2 percent growth this year. He said output could rise by as much as three percent in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The main motor is exports. There are the first signs that the domestic economy is gaining momentum,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kohl played down the recent slide in the value of the deutschemark to six-year lows below 1.80 to the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;When exports used to go badly because of a weak dollar, people complained,&quot; Kohl said. &quot;Now things are going a bit the other way, which is not earth-shaking, it does not mean that we should start moaning again.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohl's remarks -- which followed repeated verbal support of the mark by both the Bonn government and the Bundesbank this week -- caused the dollar to tick up by around half a pfennig to trade at around 1.7980 at lunchtime in Europe.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old Chancellor, in his last appearance before the Bonn media before his summer holiday in the Austrian Alps, declined to speculate on the chances of France cutting its budget deficit sufficiently this year to qualify for EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;We should leave the French to do what they themselves want to do. It is not for me say,&quot; Kohl said in answer to a question on France's EMU prospects.</p>
<p>Paris has said it is likely to miss the Maastricht treaty budget deficit goal of three percent of gross domestic product this year, and an independent audit due out next week is likely to show a shortfall of 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>Separately, Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in Munich that Bonn would cut its deficit this year to three percent of GDP, despite pressures on the budget. He said the deficit would undershoot the ceiling by &quot;a sufficient margin&quot; next year.</p>
<p>That view was disputed by the independent IWH economic research institute. &quot;Based on the current trends, I find 3.0 percent hard to imagine,&quot; IWH president Ruediger Pohl told Reuters in the east German town of Halle.</p>
<p>Pohl said, however, that a deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP this year should be no obstacle to Germany joining EMU at its planned start in 1999.</p>
<p>Kohl also urged the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to reach a compromise over government tax reforms, saying a deal could be reached quickly in parliamentary mediation.</p>
<p>Waigel's package of 30 billion marks in income and corporate tax cuts was thrown out of the upper house of parliament earlier this month by the SPD majority, condemning it to a tortuous path through legislative mediation.</p>
<p>&quot;It now depends on the SPD majority in the mediation committee whether the tax reform can take effect as planned,&quot; he said. &quot;We, the coalition, are ready to compromise. But we are not willing to give up on key elements of the tax reform.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohl said SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine's refusal to do a deal on tax amounted to &quot;betrayal against the unemployed&quot;.</p>
<p>He added that voters would reject the blocking strategy of the SPD and punish the party at next year's general election.</p>
<p>&quot;The voters will see through the tactics of the SPD. They know there is no alternative to our reform course,&quot; Kohl said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready to make this argument a central theme of the election campaign. The coalition stands for modernisation and progress, the SPD embodies old thinking and immobility.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohl sought to quell criticism by some coalition politicians of an earlier deal to cut the solidarity surcharge -- raised to finance the rebuilding of eastern Germany -- by two percentage points to 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The reduction of the solidarity surcharge from January 1998 has been agreed by the coalition,&quot; he said.</p>
