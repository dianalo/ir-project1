<p>Mexican stocks closed higher Tuesday amid expectations of a drop in primary interest rates at a government securities auction.</p>
<p>The gains, which had been pared amid light profit-taking late in the day, followed a powerful rally on Wall Street the previous session, when local markets were closed, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was firm, with brokers mainly buying low on hopes of lower auction rates this evening, with the Dow also giving a tug,&quot; a floor trader said.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended up 33.35 points, or 0.89 percent, at 3,398.23.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters survey, money market traders were forecasting that Banco de Mexico would assign 28-day Cetes, or Treasury bills, at an average of 18.56 percent, or 1.15 percentage points lower than last week.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 10.83 points, adding to a 143.29-point jump on Monday, May 5, when Mexican markets were closed for the Battle of Puebla holiday.</p>
<p>Analysts said concern over further increases in U.S. base rates had subsided since weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data were published last week.</p>
<p>Trading volume was cautious, dealers said, at 81.5 million shares. &quot;Dealing got off to a slow start after the long weekend, but we saw both locals and foreigners step in later on,&quot; the floor trader added.</p>
<p>Analysts said gains were driven mainly by the Bancomer financial group, retail group Controladora Comercial Mexicana (Comerci) and food company Maseca.</p>
<p>Bancomer, the holding company for one of Mexico's biggest banks, gained eight centavos (1 cent) to 2.88 pesos (36 cents). It was the most heavily traded stock of the session, followed by Comerci, which rose 14 centavos (2 cents) to 6.16 pesos (80 cents).</p>
<p>Maseca ended up 24 centavos (3 cents) at 7.98 pesos ($1.01) in relatively brisk trade. Bancomer, Comerci and Maseca together accounted for a quarter of all shares traded during the session.</p>
<p>Paper company Kimberly Clark de Mexico weighed most on the downside. The stock fell 50 centavos (6 cents) to 28.95 pesos ($3.66) amid persistent disappointment over its first-quarter earnings report, traders said. Kimberly-Clark Corp of the United States holds a minority share in the Mexican company.</p>
<p>On the broad market, among 115 shares traded, gainers outnumbered sliders by 64 to 29.</p>
