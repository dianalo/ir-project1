<p>The European Union of Christian Democrats (EUCD) called on Friday for greater efforts to seek normalisation of the situation in Albania before elections in June.</p>
<p>AN EUCD council meeting in the Slovak capital Bratislava rejected attempts to place the entire blame for the present chaos in the country on President Sali Berisha, but ignored a plea to express support for the beleaguered Albanian leader.</p>
<p>&quot;When necessary we will make critical statements (on the situation in Albania) as we have in the past, but we refuse to blame Berisha for everything that has happened in the country,&quot; EUCD President Wim van Velzen told a news conference.</p>
<p>But council sources said the EUCD council had ignored a passionate plea for support to Berisha by his close advisor Genc Pollo who said Berisha was the victim of an &quot;unholy alliance&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The council agreed that it needed to find out more about the situation in the country and send out a working party to Albania in May,&quot; one council member said.</p>
<p>Van Velzen said Berisha and his Democratic Party, an EUCD member, had made many mistakes in the past but that all parties concerned were to blame for the present situation.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no black-and-white picture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Albanian Democratic Party in March the EUCD demanded restoration of a free press, urged the government to avoid violence against demostrators and called for dialogue between the government and the opposition.</p>
<p>It also called for the appointment of an independent commission to investigate the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of families lost their life savings leading to widespread insurrection throughout the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Needless to say if people are found guilty, prosecution should be initiated and the Democratic Party should not hesitate to take drastic actions against party officials who have committed crimnes,&quot; the EUCD letter said at the time.</p>
<p>It was alluding to allegations that the pyramid schemes had chanelled some of their profits into financing the Democratic Party's election campaign last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The urgent need now is to find a path towards conciliation and the restoration of the rule of law,&quot; van Velzen said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope Albania will be able to resolve its problems and I am sure the European Union presence there will act to calm the situation to give the population the security it needs,&quot; the EUCD president said.</p>
