<headline>Turkish deputies begin censure motion debate.</headline>

<p>The Turkish parliament began debate on Tuesday of a censure motion brought by the leading opposition party against the country's beleaguered Islamist-led government.</p>
<p>MPs are to vote later in the day on whether to hold a censure vote against Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's coalition at the request of the main opposition Motherland Party which cites unequal civil servants' pay rises.</p>
<p>The government has faced mounting pressure after a warning from the military about the rising profile of Islamists under Erbakan's rule and rumblings of discontent from the conservative wing of the alliance.</p>
<p>But there were no immediate signs that the government, with a majority of around six in the 550-seat parliament, would lose the vote. Last week the alliance survived a vote on a censure motion brought by two leftist parties which said the country's secular system was under threat.</p>
<p>MPs were also to vote on whether to launch an inquiry into Justice Minister Sevket Kazan, a close aide of Erbakan and a member of his Welfare Party, over his Islamist activities.</p>
<p>The investigation would look into alleged abuse of his position in remarks he made suggesting members of the liberal Alevi Moslem sect take part in incestuous ceremonies and a visit he made to a Welfare mayor jailed for organising an Islamist protest also attended by Iran's ambassador.</p>
