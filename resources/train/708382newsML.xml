<title>AUSTRALIA: Macquarie's Hannes to plead not guilty.</title>
<headline>Macquarie's Hannes to plead not guilty.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lawyers for Macquarie Bank Ltd executive director Simon Hannes told a Sydney court on Friday that Hannes would plead not guilty to insider trading charges.</p>
<p>Hannes' lawyer Jim Conomos told the New South Wales local court his client would also plead not guilty to related charges of not properly declaring financial transactions.</p>
<p>Hannes, a corporate finance specialist, is accused of using inside information heard at his work to trade shares in transport firm TNT when it was bought by Dutch group Koninklijke PTT Nederland last year.</p>
<p>Macquarie advised TNT during the agreed takeover.  </p>
<p>But Hannes, who was sitting beside his laywer, was not asked to make a formal plea.</p>
<p>Hannes is due to appear again on October 23, when a date for his trial will be set.</p>
<p>An Australian Securities Commission (ASC) spokeswoman said the trial may not be held until late 1998 or possibly even early 1999. The ASC is bringing the insider trading charges, which carry a penalty of up to five years in jail.  </p>
<p>In final submissions to a committal hearing against Hannes earlier this week, the court was told he had learned from a colleague last July that transport firm TNT had been valued at between A$2.00 and just over A$3.00.</p>
<p>KPN later made a successful A$2.45 per share bid for TNT.</p>
<p>The prosecution alleges that Hannes, under an assumed name &quot;Mark Booth&quot;, bought about A$90,000 worth of A$2 TNT call options on September 17 and 18, before the October 2 announcement of the agreed takeover bid.</p>
<p>The exercise of the options would have made &quot;Booth&quot; a profit of about A$2 million.  </p>
