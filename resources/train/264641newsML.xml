<p>Spain's economy grew at a healthy 2.2 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, confirming that the recovery which the conservative government promised to deliver is well under way, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The data was largely as expected by the market but it was certainly good with the key area of private consumption showing a steady but continuous acceleration,&quot; said Alfredo Urrutia, chief economist at Societe Generale in Madrid.</p>
<p>The National Statistics Institute (INE) said gross domestic product (GDP) had grown 2.2 percent in the third quarter, well above the Bank of Spain's forecast for about two percent but broadly in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>The INE also said it had revised second-quarter growth up to 2.0 percent from 1.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The INE data confirm the consolidation of the economic recovery, supported by a very favourable private consumption and a strong growth in capital goods investment and exports,&quot; the Economy Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Most economists said there was a chance that the original 2.3 percent government target for 1996 would now be reached and some said they had revised their estimates up for the year.</p>
<p>&quot;GDP was slightly stronger than we expected and we've revised our estimates for 1996 up to 2.1 percent from 1.9,&quot; said Henrik Lumbholdt, chief economist at Bank of America in Madrid, whose original estimate was among the most cautious.</p>
<p>Most economists agreed that growth in consumer spending, a key contributor to the final GDP figure, was evidence that a healthy and sustained recovery was in progress.</p>
<p>Consumer spending grew at a rate of 2.0 percent on the year in the third quarter, compared with 1.8 percent in the second quarter and 1.6 percent in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Economists were also cheered by growth seen in capital goods investment and exports.</p>
<p>Investment in capital goods grew 8.4 percent in the third quarter, compared with 6.4 percent in the second quarter, while exports grew by 9.4 percent.</p>
<p>But the fall in construction growth wiped the smile off many economists' faces.</p>
<p>Construction spending declined by 5.3 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, after falling 2.0 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows that the construction sector is still clearly in recession,&quot; said Lumbholdt.</p>
<p>&quot;It's had very little support from the public sector and construction traditionally reacts very slowly to interest rates,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Looking towards 1997, several economists said they were not convinced by forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for 2.8 percent growth in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;It's overly optimistic and assumes a much more buoyant consumer,&quot; said Lumbholdt, whose estimate for 1997 is for 2.4 percent growth.</p>
