<p>Thursday's shortened session for U.S. Treasuries should see quiet, rangebound trading as rattled investors stick to the sidelines, nervously awaiting key economic reports next week.</p>
<p>Trading will close early at 1400 EST/1900 GMT on Thursday and stay closed on Friday. Normal trading resumes Monday.</p>
<p>Bond investors are in nail-biting mode after a startling report of strong durable goods orders, suggesting the U.S. manufacturing sector posted healthy gains in February.  </p>
<p>The report was even more worrisome because it came on the heels of a tightening of interest rates and an accompanying Fed statement, which many analysts said was worded to leave the door open for possible future rate hikes.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been bouncing off 7.0 percent; I wouldn't be surprised if that holds. People don't want to go into the weekend with heavy positions with key numbers next week. It should be very defensive with little action,&quot; said Donald Maude, chief U.S. economist at Scotia Capital Markets.</p>
<p>Next week, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) and nonfarm payrolls are due.  </p>
<p>A raft of second-tier data due Thursday will be closely watched in light of the durable goods report. Any sign of inflation or faster growth could trigger fears that a credit tightening in May is inevitable, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will very closely go with the numbers over the near-term. The jobless claims could be the most important because Greenspan made reference to it in his Humphrey-Hawkins (address) as a way to judge whether the economy is strong,&quot; said John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co Inc. &quot;But most of the bad news is priced in at this point.&quot;  </p>
<p>The first batch of data, at 0830 EST/1330 GMT, includes the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) business outlook survey for March and jobless claims for the week ended March 22. Economists surveyed by Reuters expect 313,000 new claims, just over 312,000 in the prior week.</p>
<p>At 1000 EST/1500 GMT, February existing home sales will be released. The market expects about 4.05 million compared to 3.94 million in January, according to a survey of economists polled by Reuters. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index will be released at the same time.  </p>
<p>At 1400 EST/1900 GMT, the minutes from the February meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee will be made available by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some possibilities to do better with a bid tone, but not much better ... In general, we're trying to define a new trading range of 7.05 percent to 6.90 percent on the long bond, but we don't have a trend (yet),&quot; said Neil Desarno, head trader at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Fed added $7.423 billion of temporary reserves to the U.S. banking system through a round of overnight system repurchase agreements.  </p>
<p>Funds were expected to open at 5.69 percent on Thursday analysts said.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, three-month bill rates were off five basis points to yield 5.35 percent. Six-month bills were off 3/32 to 5.56 percent. Year bills were unchanged at 5.88 percent.</p>
<p>Two-year notes were off one basis point at 6.37 percent. Five-year notes were off 2/32 to yield 6.66 percent. Ten-year notes were down 5 ticks to yield 6.79 percent.</p>
<p>The long bond was lower, off 8/32, yielding 6.99 percent.</p>
