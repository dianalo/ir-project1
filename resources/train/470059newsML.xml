<p>The volume of euro-related issues in the international bond market in the first quarter was $10.7 billion, or 5.4 percent of the total market, according to preliminary figures from Capital DATA Bondware on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Two jumbo Eurobonds have been launched (corrects to add the word &quot;jumbo&quot;) in the euro itself, by Italy and the European Investment Bank. But most issues have been launched in core EMU currencies and have clauses allowing for their redenomination when the euro is adopted.</p>
<p>The euro is the currency that will be introduced with the third stage of European economic and monetary union (EMU) which, European Union law prescribes, must go ahead by January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The impetus behind euro Eurobonds is the belief they will be more liquid after EMU than deals still denominated in French francs, guilders, marks, etc whose underlying government bond markets will disappear.</p>
<p>The first euro Eurobond was a five billion French franc offering launched by Austria on January 13. Since then there have been 26 more euro deals bring the total to $10.7 billion, according to the Capital DATA report.</p>
<p>Four sovereigns -- Austria, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- have issued euro-linked bonds so far.</p>
<p>Part of the rationale behind these deals was to gain broader exposure among European investors as smaller nations will have to fight harder for capital after EMU.</p>
<p>To further aid liquidity, all the euro Eurobonds launched so far have clauses allowing them to be fungible with future offerings by the same borrower which have the same coupon and maturity date.</p>
<p>The European Investment Bank has led the way here. It has four 5.75 percent Eurobonds -- in escudos, French francs, guilders and marks -- which all mature in February 2007.</p>
<p>The four bonds have an aggregate value of around $1.8 billion, very large by Euromarket standards.</p>
<p>The Capital data report showed 1,220 international bonds worth a total of $197.2 billion have been launched since January 1 at an average size of $162 million and making for a record first quarter.</p>
