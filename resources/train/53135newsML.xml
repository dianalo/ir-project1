<p>Two days of meetings by Arab foreign ministers made a gloomy start on Friday night when Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian ministers gave their colleagues bleak reports on the stalemate in negotiations with Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;All of them were very pessimistic about the situation... It is really not good on any of the three tracks,&quot; Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters after more than three hours of talks at his ministry in Cairo.</p>
<p>The ministers touched only briefly on events in Iraq but will have a chance to go into greater detail when they meet under Arab League auspices on Saturday, he added.</p>
<p>Egypt called Friday's meeting to review Middle East peace talks since the Arab summit in Cairo in June and Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf did not take part because his country was not invited to the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;This evening Iraq was discussed in a preliminary way. Iraq is for tomorrow, when perhaps we will hear from the minister from Iraq, but today we concentrated on follow-up to the summit communique and on the peace process,&quot; Moussa said.</p>
<p>The Cairo summit told Israel that Arab states might reconsider steps towards normal relations if the new Israeli government did not meet commitments made by the dovish administration it replaced after elections in May.</p>
<p>Three months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office, Arab states are increasingly convinced that he is trying to circumvent those commitments.</p>
<p>But Moussa declined to say what specific measures the ministers were considering in response to the stalemate on the Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian tracks.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a report submitted to the president (Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak) and to the other heads of state with recommendations and with consideration of the sitaution on the three tracks,&quot; Moussa said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to go into details because the meeting will continue tomorrow, but it was a very serious meeting... We listened to the reports of the three foreign ministers, which were very, very serious reports,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Palestinians are still waiting for Israel to redeploy from the West Bank town of Hebron and complete some of the steps agreed with the Palestinian Authority months ago.</p>
<p>Israel and the United States have sent Syria new proposals on resuming peace talks, but Syria has said it will reject them if they try to backtrack on understandings Syria reached with the previous Labour Party governement.</p>
<p>Egypt has linked progress in peace talks with a decision on whether to go ahead with a Middle East conference in November, designed to integrate israel into the regional economy.</p>
<p>The ministerial meetings in Cairo will be a timely occasion for Egypt to sound out Arab opinion on the conference.</p>
<p>But Moussa said the meeting on Friday did not discuss this. &quot;There is no final decision (on the conference),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>On Saturday at least three separate meetings will take place and at one of them, an extraordinary Arab League meeting, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will tell the Arab foreign ministers about his troubles with the new Israeli government.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Arafat would complain about restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Israel's failure to abide by some old agreements.</p>
<p>If the ministers do discuss this month's U.S. attacks on Iraq targets, the Iraqi minister will find the vast majority of his colleagues sympathetic to Baghdad's view that it has every right to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>Alone of Arab states, Kuwait has supported the United States as it brings new forces including Stealth bombers into the Gulf, possibly for further attacks on Iraq.</p>
<p>But on Friday evening, as the ministers talked, Baghdad took some of the wind out of Washington's sails by announcing that it would stop attacking U.S. and allied warplanes as they fly over northern and southern Iraq.</p>
<p>Washington reacted cautiously and defence officials said Defence Secretary William Perry would visit the Gulf region to discuss the Iraq situation.</p>
