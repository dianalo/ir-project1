<p>An international share issue by Solidere, Lebanon's biggest company, fell short of its target but Beirut bankers said on Thursday the $77 million issue was a significant achievement.</p>
<p>Solidere said the issue of Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) was oversubscribed but the company scaled back allocations, restricting them to medium- and long-term investors.</p>
<p>&quot;Subscription orders reached a total of $140 million from international investment funds and institutions,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;A total sum of $77 million only of the total subscription orders was allocated to funds that follow a medium or long term investment policy,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>According to market sources, Solidere had planned to issue 10 million GDRs worth $115-125 million, giving non-Arabs their first chance to invest in the company's reconstruction of Beirut's city centre.</p>
<p>Instead, it sold 6.7 million GDRs at $11.50, each representing one-tenth of a Solidere A share.</p>
<p>It was Solidere's first venture on the international market since its heavily oversubscribed $650 million share flotation in January 1994 which was limited to Lebanese and Arab investors.</p>
<p>The issue was the first major deal out of Lebanon not targeted at Lebanese money abroad. Market sources said demand from the United States and Europe was &quot;very strong.&quot;</p>
<p>The GDRs were quoted on Thursday in London on SEAQ, the Stock Exchange Automated Quotations system, at $11.50-$11.70 but the underlying A shares fell in Beirut to $111.875 and $113.625 at the Beirut Stock Exchange's two fixings from $113 and $114.25 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Michel Aramouni of Banque Audi's Treasury and Capital Markets said Solidere achieved its target of issuing a large slice of GDRs to international investors not eligible under Lebanese law to buy the underlying shares.</p>
<p>&quot;In that sense it is a success but we can't talk about it as a hot issue,&quot; Aramouni said.</p>
<p>A Beirut trader who asked not to be identified called the shortfall &quot;a bit of a blow&quot; but said that selling GDRs worth $77 million was a success in itself for Solidere.</p>
<p>But another trader said: &quot;The issue came in at the low end of the pricing and volume. Investors bought for $77 million and that's a significant amount, but it didn't go as well as expected.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he was not convinced that Solidere did not allocate 100 percent of the demand in order to exclude hot investors who would take very quick profits.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't buy that too much, frankly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Market sources said although the deal was heavily oversubscribed it was not sufficient to justify an issue of the size originally intended.</p>
<p>&quot;They wanted a position where there was after-market demand...In order to have sufficient after-market demand they didn't want people to get all the allocation they asked for. That's why they scaled back the issue,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>&quot;The vast majority of the demand came from U.S. and European investors. This was a deal targetted at international investors and there was very strong demand among them,&quot; he added.</p>
