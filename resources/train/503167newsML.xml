<p>The U.N. Special Commission in charge of Iraqi disarmament said Friday that little remained unknown about Baghdad's weapons potential but what was unaccounted for could still cause devasting damage and casualities.</p>
<p>Rolf Ekeus, head of the commission, said in a half-year major report that six years of work showed that &quot;not much is unknown about Iraq's retained proscribed weapons capabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>But, he said, &quot;If one single missile warhead were filled with anthrax, many millions oif lethal doses could be spread in an attack on any city of the region.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The commission is continuing its work as it cannot state that Iraq has accounted for all weapons, components and capabilities,&quot; the report stated.</p>
<p>Ekeus needs to give Iraq a clean bill of health before the oil embargo, imposed in August 1990, can be lifted. This includes a monitoring system set up in Baghdad.</p>
<p>The report harsly criticized Iraq's performance in the long-term monitoring system the commission has instituted to make sure Baghdad does not reacquire the banned weapons.</p>
<p>Ekeus warned, &quot;Iraq's deteriorating performance called into question its committment to the monitoring process and that if the trend were not reversed it could result in a  situation with political consequences, whereby monitoring could no longer be considered operational.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ekeus said a solution to the continuing weapons controversy was needed and required &quot;a major political decision by Iraq's leadership to give up once and for all, all capabilities and ambition to retain or acquire the proscribed weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>He said much of the information came from governments on what they had sold to Iraq in the past. But he noted that &quot;a small number&quot; of governments had not responded to repeated and long-standing requests for information. He did not name them.</p>
<p>But he warned it would be &quot;most unfortunate&quot; if this prevent the commission from being able to give Iraq clearance required for any lifting of sanctions.</p>
