<p>U.S. and European business leaders, trying to set the tone for transatlantic trade discussions at next month's international trade summits, urged negotiators on Saturday to take &quot;bold action&quot; to lower trade barriers.</p>
<p>The year-old trade advisory project, the Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD), met on Friday and Saturday to hammer out positions that would smooth over differing regulatory and inspection procedures for exportable products. The group met a year ago in Seville.</p>
<p>&quot;Tested once, for sale everywhere,&quot; were the words used by Ford Motor Co. chairman and TABD chair Alex Trotman to describe one of the chief aims of the two-day conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Governments must be prepared to take bold action including initiating legislative changes wherever necessary ... (to produce) a result-oriented approach to the construction of the New Transatlantic Marketplace,&quot; the group's written declaration said at the close of the meeting.</p>
<p>The business group also encouraged further strengthening of trade ties at the upcoming first meeting in Singapore of the World Trade Organization, the body created during the Uruguay trade round to mediate global trade disputes.</p>
<p>U.S. Undersecretary for International Trade, Stuart Eizenstat, said negotiators at next month's U.S.-EC summit would hopefully make progress in two key product sectors -- pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices.</p>
<p>Currently, drugs and devices must gain government approval on both sides of the Atlantic before they can be sold, instead of having approval on one side, thus allowing automatic access to the other's consumer market.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully we can reduce the need for these re-inspections,&quot; Eizenstat said.</p>
<p>Sir Leon Brittan, the vice president of the European Commission who attended the conference along with EC Commissioner for Industry Martin Bangemann, agreed that further work needed to be done in the medical product area and in information technology, but that the two sides were closer.</p>
<p>Differences on drugs and medical devices have held up a larger &quot;mutual recognition agreement&quot; governing single inspection procedures in a host of products ranging from chemicals to heavy equipment.</p>
<p>Eizenstat, who was joined at the conference by U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, also said it was important to begin discussions at the World Trade Organization meeting on such issues as global labor standards, particularly in the area of abuse of child labor.</p>
<p>&quot;Workers in industrial and developing countries must understand that trade is not a threat to their jobs,&quot; Eizenstat said. &quot;We're not interested in setting a global minimum wage or anything like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Brittan said the subject of Cuba and the U.S. Helms-Burton Act, which allows U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies that take up property in Cuba once occupied by U.S. concerns, should not &quot;poison&quot; U.S.-EC trade relations. On Thursday, Brittan gave a speech that was more conciliatory in terms of the strong European opposition to the law.</p>
<p>Eizenstat said President Bill Clinton would consider the objections of both non-U.S. and U.S. business leaders to the law's repercussions when he makes decisions on pending suspensions under the law on Jan. 16.</p>
