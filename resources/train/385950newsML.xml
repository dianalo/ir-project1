<p>The International Finance Corporation signed agreements on Tuesday to provide $10 million loan and equity finance to the Incon group of companies, the leading Moldovan fruits and vegetables processing group.</p>
<p>&quot;Agribusiness is a sector where Moldova has a comparative advantage, and Incon has a competitive advantage,&quot; Bastiaan Mohrmann, IFC Agribusiness Department official, who signed the agreement, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Incon will use financing from the IFC, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, to support a $22.6 million modernisation and expansion programme of the Cupcini, Ungheni and Floresti processing companies.</p>
<p>These three canneries, which make up the Incon group, produce 40 percent of Moldova's apple juice concentrate, consumer packed fruit juices and canned vegetable goods.</p>
<p>IFC's investment consists of a $8 million loan to Incon and equity of $2 million equivalent in the group.</p>
<p>The loan, the first by the IFC to the predominantly agricultural country, will be granted for a seven-year period, at Libor plus 4.5 percent, with a two-year grace period, with funds lent in marks.</p>
<p>The equity investment will make IFC the holder of 27 percent of Incon group, with the three canneries owning 70 percent, and management holding three percent.</p>
<p>Incon, set up in 1992, is in turn a major shareholder in each of the three canneries, which were initially sold for vouchers under Moldova's mass privatisation programme.</p>
<p>Incon group president Ion Sturza said the IFC's investment is a part of a larger project, worth a total $22.6 million. Almost $13 million has already been invested in this project.</p>
<p>Unipektin AG, a Swiss food-processing technology company, Ciba-Geigy, Russian-owned Donau-Bank AG, machinery producer FMC and Sweden's Tetra Laval have provided 30 percent of the total project investment.</p>
<p>Incon group itself invested 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement with the IFC will resolve three essential problems -- replenishing enterprise working capital, financing new equipment purchases, and rendering assistance to local agrarian companies in planting new orchards and obtaining chemical pesticides and herbicides,&quot; Sturza said.</p>
<p>Incon group's 1996 turnover was $43.4 million. It exports 30 percent of its goods to former Soviet republics and the rest to Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It plans to place its shares on international financial markets, Sturza said, without specifying any terms.</p>
<p>Mohrmann said the IFC was also considering investing in a wine-producer, leasing companies and a hotel in Moldova.</p>
