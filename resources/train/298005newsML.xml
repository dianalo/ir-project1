<headline>Hashimoto ends two-day trip to Malaysia.</headline>

<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ended a two-day visit to Malaysia on Thursday during which he discussed issues such as the growing influence of China in the region.</p>
<p>After a half-hour farewell call by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Hashimoto left for Indonesia, his third stop in a week-long tour of five Southeast Asian nation tour aimed at adding political clout to Japan's strong economic ties.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Japanese leader held a two-hour meeting with Mahathir at which he suggested that there should be more regular meetings between leaders of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Mahathir told the Japanese leader he would consult other ASEAN leaders on that request.</p>
<p>On China's growing presence in Asia, Mahathir told his Japanese counterpart that &quot;Malaysia feels a policy of friendship is better than a policy of containment,&quot; a Malaysian foreign ministry spokesman told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hashimoto is underpinning his Asia-Pacific strategy by increasing economic cooperation with ASEAN members to balance China's growing influence in the region, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's visit was smoothened by Japan's vastly reduced trade surplus with Malaysia.</p>
<p>Malaysia's trade deficit with Japan in the first 10 months of 1996 narrowed to 4.5 billion ringgit ($1.8 billion) from a staggering 29.5 billion in 1995. The trade deficit with Japan was the single biggest cause of Malaysia's worrisome current account deficit.</p>
<p>At a banquet speech for Hashimoto on Wednesday, Mahathir said he hoped Japan's ongoing process of deregulation and liberalisation would result in more Japanese imports of Malaysian goods and a further narrowing of the deficit.</p>
<p>Mahathir urged Japanese companies in Malaysia to source more locally-made materials for use in their products.</p>
<p>The Japanese leader visited Brunei on Tuesday and is due to call on leaders in Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam. He toured two other ASEAN members, Thailand and the Philippines, last year. ($1 = 2.52 ringgit)</p>
