<title>UK: Dated Brent extends slide, other North Sea steady.</title>
<headline>Dated Brent extends slide, other North Sea steady.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dated Brent's week-long slide continued on Friday, losing six cents as a cargo traded between majors at July Brent -30 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>The trade, for a June 12-14 cargo, followed a deal on Thursday when a June 8-10 loader fetched July Brent -24 cents.</p>
<p>The &quot;clocking&quot; of two Brent cargoes to Phibro and Cargill added to the soft tone on the benchmark North Sea grade. Other Brents turning wet were kept by BP and Shell, traders said.</p>
<p>Dealers said underlying fundamentals were sloppy with only an opening of the transatlantic arbitrage likely to brake wet Brent's fall.</p>
<p>Brent was also weaker on the forward paper market, July shedding 19 cents to $19.29 a barrel by 1732 GMT.</p>
<p>Intermonth spreads eased a cent or two from Thursday's closing levels, June/July trading twice at -17 cents and July/August twice at -14 cents.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs were thinly traded but lost about two cents for next week (June 2-6) to talk around July Brent -34/-30 cents.</p>
<p>Other North Sea markets were quiet, reported trade limited to a June 25 Ekofisk on a quotes-related basis, but traders said differentials were steady after a raft of second-half June cargoes were cleared out on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still good interest although some people believe they will be able to pick up barrels cheaper after Brent's fall,&quot; said a North Sea producer.</p>
<p>An easing in North Sea tanker rates was also expected to exert pressure on premiums for offshore loading grades with fixed freight costs.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, the June Urals market was still struggling to find its stride after an oil spill at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk earlier this week caused some disruption to loading schedules.</p>
<p>Berth two, the last berth to reopen after the spill on Tuesday night, was due to be operational again by the end of Friday, a shipping source said.</p>
<p>One Urals cargo, scheduled to load June 9-10, was on offer at Dated Brent -$1.35 a barrel cif Augusta, traders said.</p>
