<p>*Dlr/yen nudges 108.50, with next resistance seen 108.60/70.</p>
<p>*Dlr/mark ends US trade flat after recovering morning losses.</p>
<p>*Mark/yen remains driving force. Now seen pinned below 73.60.</p>
<p>*EMU jitters bolster mark/EMS. Sweden's Asbrink hints at late</p>
<p>entry. Tax cuts rumored in French, other Europe budget talks. *Traders dubious of Tietmeyer/Kohl supportive EMU comments.</p>
<p>The dollar continued its rally against the yen in the U.S. Wednesday after a report of surprising weakness in Japan's economy, and closed flat against the surging mark after recouping most of its early losses, dealers said.</p>
<p>Japan's widely-watched quarterly business outlook survey, or Tankan, fell further into negative territory, while most analysts had expected the report to show economic expansion.</p>
<p>The report squashed talk that Japan would soon raise official interest rates, sinking the yen against the dollar, the mark and the British pound, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The report was much weaker than expected, so people were selling yen and buying everything else,&quot; said Francois Akl, chief currency dealer at Gulf International Bank.</p>
<p>The dollar closed higher at 108.42/49 yen from 108.20/30 at the open, but fell to 1.4765/70 marks from 1.4770/80.</p>
<p>The yen's weakness boosted the mark and the pound more than the dollar, dealers noted, with mark/yen posting a six-week high at 73.48 and sterling/yen rising over a yen.</p>
<p>Investors bid up the mark as several European officials hinted their nations might not meet European monetary union (EMU) entry criteria by the January 1999 deadline.</p>
<p>Bad news regarding EMU's outlook typically helps the mark, since the proposed new European currency, or euro, is seen supplanting the mark as Europe's premier investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink caused a stir by expressing doubts his nation would join EMU on time, boosting the mark, especially against the Swedish crown.</p>
<p>French officials denied rumors they planned to cut taxes to stimulate a sagging economy, which could hamper France's efforts to reduce its budget deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a lot of buying marks and selling yen, more than we saw straight dollar buying or selling,&quot; said Oli Enqvist, chief spot currency dealer at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.</p>
<p>German President Helmut Kohl and Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer each spoke in favor of EMU and strict adherence to the entry criteria late in the trading session, which dealers considered an effort to rein in the surging mark.</p>
<p>But the comments appeared to backfire, serving only to heighten EMU concerns and further bolster the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Those assertions drew an even bigger question mark over EMU's validity. They were basically trying to jawbone the market,&quot; said a dollar trader at a European bank in New York.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's chief economist, Otmar Issing, cast doubts on Germany's ability to meet the EMU criteria Tuesday.</p>
<p>Investors also remain convinced that German interest rates have bottomed out and will soon begin rising, dealers said.</p>
<p>The dollar's failure to rise after a surprisingly large cut in Germany's repo rate to 3.0 percent from 3.3 percent last Thursday reflects that concern.</p>
<p>&quot;The mark has remained very strong after the repo cut, which looks like it might be the last one. In the near future, the market's focus will remain on the mark,&quot; Akl said.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar slipped to 1.1924/29 Swiss francs from 1.1925/35. Sterling rose to $1.5591/98 from $1.5565/75.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to Canadian $1.3659/64 from C$1.3663/68. The Australian dollar rose to $0.7913/18 from $0.7906/11.</p>
