<p>Hundreds of armed Guatemalan military police defied their superiors and seized their own compound on Thursday in the first army rebellion against terms of a peace treaty signed last month.</p>
<p>The protesters demanded severance pay when the 4,000-strong military police (PMA) is dissolved this year as part of promises made by the government in the peace accords signed with leftist rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;For the moment we are staying here. We aren't going to go and we aren't going to turn in our arms,&quot; Sgt. Corado told reporters. He refused to give his first name.</p>
<p>It was the first such protest by the country's powerful army since the Dec. 29 peace treaty that ended a 36-year war in which 140,000 Guatemalans died or disappeared.</p>
<p>The fate of the military police was part of a government pledge within that treaty to cut the armed forces by a third. For much of Guatemala's recent history, the army has played a pivotal, and at times brutal, role in political life.</p>
<p>Army spokesman Otto Noack said the peace agreements were clear that all demobilized army personnel would receive government aid for a &quot;productive return&quot; to civilian life, but they did not fix an amount of severance pay.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the big worry of the people who work in the PMA, how much their severance pay or benefits will be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The protest began late on Wednesday when the military policemen refused to turn in their arms after work and took over their fortified compound in northern Guatemala City.</p>
<p>Most of the urban military policemen work around the city during the day, providing security at banks, government buildings and private businesses.</p>
<p>During the protest some of the police stopped traffic on streets around the compound and harangued drivers. They demanded negotiations with the government, asking for promises of $6,600 to $8,300 severance pay each.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure that you will not have to leave empty-handed,&quot; Gen. Manuel Ventura of the Defence Ministry, who arrived on Thursday at the compound to negotiate with the protesters, told the armed men.</p>
<p>&quot;This is pretty worrying because it is an attempt against the peace treaty,&quot; Congressman Gumercindo Donis, president of the Congressional National Defence Committee, told reporters.</p>
