<title>ROMANIA: Bucharest stocks mixed, high-caps on slide.</title>
<headline>Bucharest stocks mixed, high-caps on slide.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bucharest stocks traded mixed on Thursday, with stronger buying pressure on the second tier and with most blue chips losing on their average prices.</p>
<p>First-tier falls were mostly behind the drop in three independent market indices, which are based on average prices and market capitalisation.</p>
<p>Overall, the average price of 22 stocks rose, 20 fell and three were flat. Two companies were halted from trading. A suspension of first-tier Arctic  refrigerator maker was extended to August 1 pending the company's privatisation.</p>
<p>&quot;Heavyweights opened strong but most of them fell in late trading as selling pressure intensified,&quot; a trader said. &quot;On the buying side, investors were reluctant to pay high prices.&quot;</p>
<p>Unofficial indices VAB, BIG and CAS-SE slipped by 3.34, 3.42 and 3.32 percent respectively from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Volume rose to 3.9 million shares from 3.7 million and turnover was some 1.4 billion lei up at 19.3 billion.</p>
<p>The first tier dominated trading, taking 80 percent of total volume and 87 percent of turnover.</p>
<p>The section's most heavily traded stocks were Azomures fertiliser maker and chemical plant Oltchim. Both closed lower, with Azomures shedding 100 lei to 3,800 and Oltchim losing 800 lei to end at 4,250.</p>
<p>On the lower tier Ciprom steel pipe maker traded the largest volume, or 151,725 million shares. It closed flat at 1,800.</p>
<p>Also active were Apcarom  plumbing equipment maker and Amep  canned food packaging company. Apcarom weakened 350 lei to 1,450 and Amep ended 80 lei lower at 1,800.</p>
