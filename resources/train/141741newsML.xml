<p>A bizarre cholesterol-cutting margarine produced by a small Finnish firm mainly from pine trees will start going on sale abroad next year, and hit U.S. markets in the next few years, the company said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The product, launched only in Finland last November as a special diet spread and scientifically proven to be &quot;effective in decreasing blood serum cholesterol levels&quot;, will first go on sale in Sweden next year, said Raision Tehtaat Oy.</p>
<p>&quot;We will certainly see it on the U.S. market during the next few years,&quot; said Matti Salminen, CEO of Raisio, which is named after its tiny western Finnish hometown.</p>
<p>Raisio said it was applying for a so-called European Patent for the discovery, which the Finnish press has dubbed &quot;the miracle margarine&quot;: patents have been granted in the United States, Russia, Australia and Poland, and are pending elsewhere.</p>
<p>It said it would invest about 150 million markka ($33 million) this year and next and build a second factory to boost its output of the product, which research in the New England Journal of Medicine proved lowered cholesterol levels by 10-14 percent.</p>
<p>The margarine, Benecol, has been a sell-out in Finland, its availability restricted by scarce supplies of the key raw ingredient: fat-soluble stanol esters, made from a substance called plant sterol which is particularly common in pine trees.</p>
<p>The plant sterol has hitherto been washed away as a by-product of the pulp-making process: Raisio said it was in talks with Europe's largest forestry firm UPM-Kymmene Oy as well as other vegetable oil producers to ensure more long-term supply.</p>
<p>But Salminen said the product may not be sold in the U.S. in margarine form, as currently in Finland. The company has said it can adapt the fat to suit the consumers' diets -- for instance, in a cholesterol-cutting chocolate bar.</p>
<p>Research has shown two grams a day to be an effective dosage of stanol, which amounts to about 25 grams of Benecol margarine.</p>
<p>Raisio said the new factory would give it capacity to esterify 2,000 tonnes yearly -- which Salminen said corresponds to about 20 million tonnes of margarine.</p>
<p>Sales of the margarine will reach about 250 million markka in 1996 and 1997, Raisio said.</p>
<p>Raisio's stock has exploded this year amid enthusiasm for the new product's prospects, surging by 450 percent to an early September peak of 339.00 markka before retreating. On Thursday it rose again, up 5.60 markka at 308 in the Helsinki afternoon.</p>
<p>But so far investors are buying more on hope than on bumper results -- Raisio had 1995 sales of around three billion markka and profit of around 140 million.</p>
<p>Its deputy chief executive Jukka Maki said investors should not be in too much of a hurry to see profits.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will have to wait another one-and-a-half years -- something like that -- before we can see a real profit-maker. Now we are investing so much,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television in an interview.</p>
