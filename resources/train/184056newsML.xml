<headline>INTERVIEW - Amersham advancing on two fronts.</headline>

<p>Amersham International Plc, a health products and scientific services company, welcomed a big jump in its heathcare profitability and a milestone in its life sciences sales revealed by its interim results on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chief executive Bill Castell told Reuters in a telephone interview that the company was now benefiting from full distribution capacity for both its core businesses in all major markets -- namely the United States, Japan and Europe.</p>
<p>For healthcare, he said its enlarged interest in Japanese joint venture NMP and new U.S. distributors meant &quot;a step change in profitability and a step change in distribution capability&quot;.  </p>
<p>A surge in U.S. turnover, up 27 percent in the half, had been heralded by the approval by the FDA of Amersham's core Myoview radioactive heart-imaging agent earlier this year.</p>
<p>Castell said it was boosted by a new pharmacy alliance deal that had in effect given the company national distribution capability, and he saw the sharp growth trend continuing for a while as the firm brings more products into that market.</p>
<p>&quot;In the near-term, I expect us to continue with good growth because we're taking out more innovative products,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Nihon Medi-Physics joint venture, co-owned with Sumitomo Chemical, became healthcare's star profit performer.  </p>
<p>Amersham's interest contributed 4.3 million stg to the division's profit before interest and tax of 14.1 million stg and Castell described this result as ahead of expectations.</p>
<p>The company anticipated a further jump in the contribution level from the NMP venture later in the year when it completes the final increase in its stake to 50 percent, but it cautioned that profits would depend on exchange rate and taxation effects.</p>
<p>Across the healthcare group, trading margins before research and development expenses rose to 18 percent, versus 14.6 percent in the year-ago half, reflecting an increased mix of higher margin branded products as well as volume gains.  </p>
<p>Castell said the other half of the business, life science services, was also shifting towards higher growth market segments. An indicator of this was the fast growing client list among pharmaceutical companies, where he saw great potential.</p>
<p>He said that the case of sales from Amersham's drug development services (DDS) unit, which provides support for research, showed how demand from clearly-identified, corporate laboratories, rather than its traditional customer base of tens of thousands of academic institutions, was driving ahead.</p>
<p>During the half such industrial sales passed 50 percent of the total for the first time, reaching 53 percent, he said.  </p>
<p>As a whole, the life science division produced an 11 percent increase in profits before interest and tax of 17.3 million stg, a level of growth achieved without raising costs.</p>
<p>Castell said he believed the genome-based market was set to become &quot;the major growth market&quot; for the future and the company was well placed to support the drug industry's progress in that direction when its work becomes increasingly based on genetic understanding rather than on cellular understanding. Amersham's moves to date to devise or acquire key intellectual property rights in both the genome and sequencing areas meant the unit was &quot;at the hub of the industry&quot;, he added, promising that the company would use its own resources, and look for partnerships with others, in order to keep up this momentum.</p>
<p>The perception in the investment community that Amersham is moving deeper into the life sciences field and is more than a radioactive medicine company was encouraging, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, our focus is on servicing the pharmaceutical sector and bringing them technologies that will allow them to continue to innovate,&quot; Castell said.</p>
