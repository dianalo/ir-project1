<headline>Sugar freight business calmer but Far East active.</headline>

<p>New sugar freight  business was thin on the ground on Friday as the market took space to breathe after this week's rush of fixtures, shipbrokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The East has been quite busy...Indonesia has been the star of the week,&quot; said one, citing fixtures of Thai sugar by Kerry, E D &amp; F Man and other charterers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very slow -- the Far East business is picking up with Thailand-Indonesia and Thailand-Japan. The Brazil and Continent markets are both very quiet,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>The only new business reported was on the account of Benham or nominee, quoting for 18,814 tonnes in bulk from Taiwan to Crockett for 5/15 February.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Corp announced a tender for  January 30 in New York for a 30,000-tonne shipment of raw sugar to fulfil its fiscal buying plan.</p>
<p>The tender, which falls on January 31 Taiwan time, will specify April 20 to May 5 delivery dates.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar has bought 90,000 tonnes of sugar in the fiscal year to date, including 60,000 tonnes arranged through a three-year supply deal negotiated privately with Czarnikow Sugar.</p>
<p>The deal took effect in 1997 but leaves Taiwan Sugar 30,000 tonnes short of fulfilling its 120,000 tonne fiscal purchasing plan.</p>
<p>Colombian truckers demanding standby payments for time lost during a nine-day dockworkers' strike in Buenaventura prevented work from returning to normal on Friday.</p>
<p>The dockworkers returned to work on Friday morning, a day after winning a deal with shipowners and cargo handling operators that should more than double their wages.</p>
