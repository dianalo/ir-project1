<p>The Polish government appointed a team on Friday to negotiate terms of the country's entry to NATO, saying it was ready to meet all obligations and costs stemming from membership.</p>
<p>The eight officials, led by deputy foreign minister Adnrzej Towpik, will probably start the accession talks later this month and conclude them by December, Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;We have decided to set up a special team to negotiate our NATO entry...We hope for full membership in 1999,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Poland will also step up talks with the Czech Republic and Hungary, two other former Soviet bloc states invited to join the Western military alliance at its Madrid summit this week, on coordinating their membership negatiations, Rosati said.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue will be discussed at forthcoming meetings of the defence, foreign ministers and then prime ministers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Poland's strategic importance as a prospective NATO member was highlighted on Thursday, when U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Warsaw to celebrate with residents the NATO decision.</p>
<p>Clinton praised Poland's economic and democratic achievements since communism fell in 1989 but stressed the responsibilities and burdens that come with NATO membership, including paying for defence and nurturing democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to meet all obligations stemming from the membership,&quot; said Rosati, who on Thursday held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on this issue.</p>
<p>He said U.S. and Polish officials had agreed to cooperate on convincing American public opinion that NATO expansion was beneficial, to boost prospects for the enlargement's ratification by the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Rosati confirmed the Polish government estimated it would spend some $150-$200 million annully for about 15 years to ensure Polish and NATO forces had common command procedures and were inter-operational in other respects.</p>
<p>Government experts are still working on a long-term programme of modernising the armed forces, so it is too early to give any estimates of how much this would cost, he said.</p>
<p>He added that costs were impossible to fully forecast before the NATO accession talks were over.</p>
<p>Deputy defence minister Andrzej Karkoszka, also present, said a much of these costs would be covered by savings due to planned cuts in military personnel to 180,000 from the current 230,000 and by getting rid of old equipment.</p>
