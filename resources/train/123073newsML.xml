<p>An outbreak of the Ebola virus in Gabon has killed 11 people from 18 cases, the World Health Organisation said from neighbourig Congo on Thursday.</p>
<p>The figures given by WHO's Africa regional director Ebrahim Samba showed one more death and four new cases since the agency's last medical bulletin on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In that statement, WHO said four Ebola victims were in hospital in northeastern Gabon where the haemorrhagic virus killed 13 people in February.</p>
<p>Gabon confirmed on Tuesday that 14 people had caught the virus in the region since July 24. Ebola has a fatality rate of about 80 percent.</p>
<p>The first victim in the latest outbreak was a hunter suspected to have caught the virus in the forest. He died on August 23 in a hospital at Boue, east of the capital Libreville.</p>
<p>Samba said 40 people among 60 who came into contact with the victims were being observed by medical teams.</p>
<p>At least 13 people died in the area last February in an outbreak of Ebola, which is marked by fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and massive bleeding.</p>
<p>Health officials said then the virus broke out among families who ate or handled dead chimpanzees in the remote area.</p>
<p>Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with blood secretions or body fluids.</p>
<p>The virus struck in Kikwit, Zaire in May 1995, killing 245 people. A single victim in Ivory Coast last December survived.</p>
