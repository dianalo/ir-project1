<title>CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: Heavy firing in Central Africa, residents flee.</title>
<headline>Heavy firing in Central Africa, residents flee.</headline>
<dateline>BANGUI 1996-11-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hundreds of people fled the Central African capital Bangui on Saturday following a night of sustained heavy gunfire in clashes between mutinous soldiers and loyalist troops, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are fleeing towards the south of the country which is under rebel control,&quot; said a resident living in a district of the capital near the main road south.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of casualties in the firing which lasted for about four hours from four a.m. (0300 GMT) in one of the most serious exchanges since soldiers mutinied on November 16. Sporadic shooting continued by mid-morning.</p>
<p>French troops based in the former French colony under bilateral accords have been guarding the palace of President Ange-Felix Patasse and other strategic points.</p>
<p>They fought bloody battles with local soldiers during a more serious revolt last May but have so far not clashed with the rebels this time. Residents said the French were not involved in the latest fighting.</p>
<p>Rebel soldiers have hardened generalised grievances over pay and conditions and are now calling for Patasse's resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;We demand the resignation of President Patasse and we are ready to put down our arms are soon as he leaves,&quot; a rebel spokesman, Sergeant Christian Guere, said.</p>
<p>Patasse, who was away in Europe when the mutiny erupted, returned home last Tuesday rejecting the rebel demand for his departure. He was due to reaffirm his determination to stay in power in an address to the nation on Saturday night on the eve of National Day.</p>
