<p>The South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu was reported calm on Saturday after a group of paramilitary police abducted, then released, the president and the acting prime minister over a pay dispute.</p>
<p>Paramilitary police abducted President Jean-Marie Leye just after dawn, commandeered a plane and flew him to a neighbouring island where they met acting prime minister Barak Sope who was there on business, Australian Broadcasting Corp radio reported.</p>
<p>They returned the two to the capital, Port Vila, demanding an immediate cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The cabinet agreed to resolve the dispute, which was over overtime pay arrears of about US$150,000, ABC reported.</p>
<p>A producer at Radio Vanuatu in the capital, Port Vila, told Reuters by telephone that the country was peaceful.</p>
<p>&quot;I think from now on the situation will go back to normal, there's no problem at all, and it's okay,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody was hurt and everything is okay.&quot;</p>
<p>An Australian foreign affairs official also said the situation seemed to be under control and all was reported to be calm. No injuries were reported, he said.</p>
<p>The paramilitary forces have been on strike for two weeks over the pay claim.</p>
<p>The 80-island nation has been embroiled in a political crisis since the last election in November 1995, when no party won a majority in the 50-seat parliament.</p>
<p>The government of Maxime Carlot was toppled in September when parliament passed a vote of no confidence.</p>
<p>Serge Vohor, the only candidate, was elected prime minister.</p>
<p>Vohor was visiting French Polynesia on Saturday.</p>
<p>Vanuatu, with a population of about 145,000, was formerly known as the New Hebrides and was governed jointly by Britain and France until independence in 1980.</p>
