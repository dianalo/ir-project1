<p>The European Commission is mulling the possibility of charging fees for probing mergers and takeovers due to the European Union's budgetary constraints.</p>
<p>In a proposal to revise the EU's merger regulation, COM(96)313, it said it &quot;will consider the possible charging of registration fees&quot;.</p>
<p>The fee could be 6,000 European currency units per deal notified, the proposal forwarded to the Council of Ministers says.</p>
<p>The Commission announced at a news conference in July it had agreed to revise the turnover thresholds set in regulation 4064/89, which determine whether a merger or takeover is large enough to qualify for EU review. At the time it did not breathe a word about possible fees.</p>
<p>The full proposal was made available this week.</p>
<p>But although it came as a surprise, it was no bold step, anti-trust lawyers said.</p>
<p>Competition authorities in Germany and Britain also charge fees which can be much higher, as the Commission noted in the proposal. They amount to between 12,000 to 15,000 marks for the German Federal Cartel Office and 5,000 to 15,000 pounds in Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;The fee is at the lower end of the fees charged by other competition authorities,&quot; Alec Burnside, a partner with law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines in Brussels, told Reuters.</p>
<p>It was also a drop in the ocean compared with the total legal costs involved in having a merger cleared under the EU's fast-track rules, which range from $25,000 to $500,000 depending on the complexity of the deal and the geographical markets involved.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not going to be significant when seen against the overall cost of doing the deal,&quot; Burnside said.</p>
<p>EU national governments are increasingly reluctant to allow a rise in the Union's central budget as they struggle to meet the Maastricht treaty's strict budget deficit criteria to qualify for the European single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>But, if they were to agree to the Commission's proposal to revise the merger regulation, they would have no choice but to increase the budget for merger reviews as the 6,000-Ecu fee would cover only a fraction of the costs involved in vetting such deals.</p>
<p>The Commission estimated it would need an additional 28 people to deal with the increased workload resulting from the revised merger rules. The current staff is about 60.</p>
<p>This would cost 2.5 million Ecus, it said. In comparison, the fee would only raise 1.2 million Ecus assuming the powerful merger task force would receive some 200 notifications a year, the Commission said in its proposal.</p>
<p>For the Commission to be able to introduce a merger registration fee at a later stage, the Council must agree to a change in article 23 of the regulation to add the words &quot;fees for&quot; after the phrase &quot;concerning the form, content,&quot;. The level of the fee would be solely up to the Commission.</p>
