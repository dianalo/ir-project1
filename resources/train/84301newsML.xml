<p>An experimental vaccine for multiple sclerosis (MS) appears to have halted or slowed the progressive neurological disease in about half the patients who took part in a small study, researchers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The vaccine is designed as a therapy, not as a way of preventing MS. The hope is that if patients are treated early, the disease can be stopped in its tracks through a vaccine alone or through a vaccine combined with drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;What you are looking for is not turning back the clock but stopping things from getting worse,&quot; Dr. Dennis Bourdette, co-author of a research paper appearing in Tuesday's edition of the journal Nature Medicine, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Bourdette works at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Portland, Oregon, and the MS Clinic at Oregon Health Sciences University.</p>
<p>MS occurs when some cells in the immune system start attacking myelin, the insulation around nerve cells.</p>
<p>In a year-long double-blind study, a synthesized peptide, or compound formed from amino acids, was tested on 23 patients with progressive MS.</p>
<p>Only about half the patients injected with the peptide vaccine had an immunological response to it. The vaccine boosted the number of &quot;good&quot; immune cells in their blood and inhibited the disease-causing ones.</p>
<p>And all six patients with an immunological response also had a clinical response -- their disease remained stable for a year.In contrast, 10 of the 17 people who did not have a response or who received a placebo got worse, according to clinical measurements.</p>
<p>Whether the patients who did not respond to the vaccine would have if a different peptide had been used is not yet known.</p>
<p>Biotech company Connective Therapeutics of Palo Alto, California, announced on Monday that it planned to conduct larger-scale, longer-term studies of the vaccine.</p>
<p>About 250,000 people in the United States have MS. Two drugs have been approved to give partial control of the disease, and a third is near approval. None is a cure.</p>
<p>MS usually strikes in young adulthood. About 60 percent of patients are women, and 40 percent men. Although the pace and pattern of the disease varies widely, many patients gradually lose muscle control.</p>
