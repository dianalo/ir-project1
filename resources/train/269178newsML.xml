<p>Clean tanker chartering rates in the Mideast, Asia and the Caribbean strengthened over the week for various vessel sizes, ship brokers said.</p>
<p>Voyages for 55,000 tonners to Japan from the Mideast were worth W215 by the end of the week, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The ongoing demand for January ensures that the market will start the new year on very firm conditions,&quot; brokers E.A. Gibson said in a weekly report.</p>
<p>Rates in Asia for smaller 30,000 tonne vessels were also firm, brokers said, because of continuing delays in India and good winter demand for product.</p>
<p>Friday's fixtures saw rates for 29,000 tonne gas oil vessels making voyages from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean at a sickly W165, while Vitol took the 28,000 tonne Mormacsun from the Med to the USAC at W230. Cross-Med naphtha rates for 27,500 tonnes were assessed at around W225.</p>
<p>Caribs markets for 30,000 tonners moving to the USAC were buoyant and by Friday had reached, and perhaps surpassed, W300. &quot;With the Venezuelans continuing to export large volumes of product,&quot; one broker said, &quot;owners will have something to celebrate at Christmas.</p>
