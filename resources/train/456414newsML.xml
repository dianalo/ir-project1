<title>USA: CBOT wheat ends up on fund buying plus flood focus.</title>
<headline>CBOT wheat ends up on fund buying plus flood focus.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT wheat futures closed higher on fund buying and a potential for flooding this spring in the U.S. Midwest, traders said.</p>
<p>The fund buying was estimated at 15.0 million bushels.</p>
<p>Spring flooding in the U.S. Midwest could damage some of the U.S. winter wheat crop and delay seeding of the spring wheat crop, traders said.</p>
<p>Midwest soil moisture levels were already at a high level making the threat of flood-damage more likely. Also heavy snowpack in the U.S. northern Midwest led to the possibility of additional flooding problems.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have the threat of flooding this spring,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter. &quot;There was fund buying and a lack of offers.&quot;</p>
<p>Some traders said the surge in the soybean complex was central to the gains in wheat futures with the soy complex pits boosted by fund buying, active exports and a lower-than-expected soymeal stocks tally in Thursday's February Census Bureau crush report.</p>
<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed two to 12 cents per bushel higher, with May up 6-1/2 at $3.97-1/2. July was up 6-1/4 at $3.89-1/2.  </p>
<p>Wheat also found support from USDA's weekly export sales report. That data, released early Thursday, revealed U.S. net export sales of wheat in the week ended March 13 at 449,100 tonnnes, above expectations for 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Technicians early Thursday cited first support in the May at $3.85 and second support at $3.75-1/2. The session low for May was $3.93. First resistance in the May was $3.94-1/2 and second was at $4.04. The session high for May was $4.03.</p>
<p>The four- and 20-day moving averages were giving off bullish signals early Thursday.</p>
<p>The nine-day relative strength index (RSI) in the May closed at 74-1/2 percent. The market generally considers an RSI of 70 or more as overbought and 30 or less as oversold.</p>
<p>Refco Inc bought six million bushels of July, LIT America and FIMAT Futures bought two million July and Griffin Trading bought two million July, traders said. Dean Witter bought three million bushels of July, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 24,000, nearly double the 12,170 traded Wednesday.</p>
<p>In wheat options, FIMAT Futures bought 1,000 May $3.70 puts and sold 1,000 May $3.90 puts at 7-1/2 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Goldenberg Hehmeyer bought 500 July $3.50 puts at six cents, Smith Barney bought 500 May $3.60 puts and sold 500 May $3.90 puts at six cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat options volume was estimated at 10,000 contracts, above the 4,602 traded Wednesday.</p>
