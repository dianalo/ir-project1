<p>Tokyo stocks shed more than three percent on Thursday to close at the lowest level in over a year after a key business leader warned of &quot;grave problems&quot; if the market continues to fall.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks also slumped amid concern over rising U.S. interest rates and fears the government could impose measures to curb growing property speculation, which hurt property shares.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, markets were mixed. Seoul shares were clear winners in the region, scoring gains of almost 3 percent.</p>
<p>Tokyo's key 225-share Nikkei average fell 606.51 points, or 3.25 percent, to 18,073.87. Dealers said the fall brought it one step closer to the next psychological support level of 18,000.</p>
<p>Bank shares in Tokyo in particular were under pressure on Thursday, which pulled other sectors down.</p>
<p>A senior official at Japan's Ministry of Finance told Reuters the country's economy is not in as bad a state as the stock market thinks.</p>
<p>However, Jiji news agency quoted the chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce as saying Japan will face &quot;grave problems&quot; before Japanese banks close their books for the fiscal year if stocks continue to fall.</p>
<p>The comment prompted the sharp drop, which extended the Nikkei's earlier loss of more than 500 points.</p>
<p>Brokers have been concerned that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will do little to help an already nascent economic recovery while implementing needed structural reforms.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks closed sharply lower, rocked by concerns about higher U.S. interest rates, fears of government measures to curb property speculation and a sell-off in Japanese shares.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index slid 256.82 points, or 1.91 percent, to close at 13,198.11.</p>
<p>In Seoul, markets ignored calls by South Korea's main labour union group for the biggest strike in the nation's history and soared on bargain hunting, active buying in financial shares and easing pressure from margin loan calls, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite stock index ended 18.46 points, or a hefty 2.97 percent, higher at 639.87.</p>
<p>Thai stocks overcame several bouts of profit-taking to end higher for the fourth straight day as investors bought on hopes that the property sector would prosper because of government funds, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index finished 11.29 points or 1.36 percent higher at 843.22.</p>
<p>Blue-chip shares in Bombay were boosted by buying from local players and foreign funds in hectic trading, brokers said. The 30-share index leapt 72.93 points or a steep 2.22 percent to close at 3,361.81.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, shares ended slightly lower after trading turned volatile due to the launch of offshore Taiwan stock futures in Singapore and Chicago. The index closed 8.67 points lower, or 0.12 percent, at 7,010.76.</p>
<p>Singapore shares escaped the bearishness that hit Tokyo and Hong Kong, closing modestly higher on support in second board issues and some blue chips, dealers said.</p>
<p>The key Straits Times Industrials index closed 10.47 points higher at 2,253.73 on a robust turnaround of 212 million shares.</p>
<p>Profit taking across the board in some heavyweight and banking stocks forced the Jakarta stock index to close lower, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said the sharp falls in regional markets also hurt sentiment.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index fell 4.77 points, or 0.72 percent, to close at 657.43 points.</p>
<p>Philippine stocks ended up 16.37 points, or 0.51 percent, at 3,223.36, while in Malaysia, shares ended down 0.21 percent or 2.62 points at 1,236.92.</p>
<p>Australian shares surged to a higher close, defying a wobbly Wall Street and hitting new highs in the afternoon session before easing back.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index reached a record high of 2,429.2, surpassing the previous record high of 2,426.5 reached on December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>The index closed at 2,423.2, a gain of 8.2 points.</p>
<p>Hong Kong gold slid sharply to end below New York's previous close after continuous selling during the day, but a shortage of gold bars in Hong Kong made physical buying almost impossible, dealers said.</p>
<p>Bullion ended at US$354.00/50 an ounce against New York's US$355.70/356.10 close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Crude oil futures in Asia were steady in late trading on Thursday. February North Sea Brent futures on SIMEX last traded at $24.80 per barrel, in line with London's settlement, which rose 21 cents on Wednesday amid forecasts of cold weather on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
