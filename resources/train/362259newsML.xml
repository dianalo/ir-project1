<p>Former Hollywood mogul Giancarlo Parretti is not expected to return to the United States from Italy in time to meet a court deadline on Friday relating to perjury and evidence-tampering convictions, a legal source told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>If he does not show at a bail forfeiture hearing on Friday, he could forfeit the $25,000 in cash that secured his $100,000 bail in Delaware on the 1996 convictions.</p>
<p>&quot;Our best efforts are being made for his return, but it's less and less likely that it is going to happen because of the time. The problem is his ability to get out of Italy by Friday,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Parretti was charged with tax fraud in Italy.</p>
<p>He left the United States for Italy shortly before a scheduled Jan. 6 sentencing hearing. A jury found him guilty in October.</p>
<p>The charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years, stemmed from a 1991 Delaware Chancery Court case in which Parretti lost control of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. to France's Credit Lyonnais, which financed his $1.3 billion buyout of MGM in 1990.</p>
<p>Parretti's California lawyer, William Genego of Santa Monica, Calif., declined to comment.</p>
<p>Genego was representing Parretti's appeal of an extradition order by a California federal court which would send him to France, where he was wanted on a number of charges including abuse of corporate assets. Parretti faced a loss of $100,000 bail if he failed to return to deal with his legal problems there.</p>
<p>Delaware Deputy attorney general Paul Wallace told Reuters a bail forfeiture hearing was scheduled for Friday before Judge Richard Cooch of the Delaware Superior Court.</p>
<p>&quot;We have some inquiries out about what his circumstances are and I'm not at liberty to disclose anything about that,&quot; Wallace said.</p>
<p>Still scheduled for March in California federal court was the trial of Parretti's $3.9 billion lawsuit against Credit Lyonnais, wherein he accused the bank of conspiring to defraud him when it took control of MGM after the Delaware Chancery Court ruled in the bank's favour.</p>
