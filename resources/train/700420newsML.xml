<headline>Dollar/mark just off new 40-mth highs below 1.75.</headline>

<p>The dollar raced to fresh 40-month peaks below 1.75 marks and 11-day highs above 115 yen in early Europe, fuelled by strong U.S. data ahead of Federal Open Market Committee meeting and perceptions of a soft euro, said analysts.</p>
<p>A sharp fall in Tokyo stocks, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stock average ended down 429.44 points or 2.08 percent on Tuesday, also encouraged dollar bulls, said traders.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again the soft euro argument has gained the upper hand,&quot; said Lee Ferridge, currency strategist at Commerzbank, adding the dollar was also well bid as fresh U.S. data, ahead of the FOMC meeting later on Tuesday. pointed to a robust economy.  </p>
<p>At 0745 GMT dollar/mark was trading at 1.7460/70 marks against 1.7432/39 in late Europe on Monday and just below fresh highs of 1.7488 marks visited in early Europe.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar was trading at 115.10/5.13  yen against 114.49/54 in late Europe</p>
<p>Strong U.S. data released on Monday suggests growth could be picking up again after several months of slowing, said analysts.</p>
<p>And with the key Chicago and New York manufacturing indexes posting strong gains for June, analysts believe Tuesday's National Association of Purchasing Management survey, due a 1400 GMT, will also be robust, with forecasts at 56.4.  </p>
<p>&quot;We had the regional purchasing mangers' surveys, and they were all pretty upbeat. We've got the NAPAM this afternoon and then the FOMC meets. People are starting to think that maybe they (FOMC) might do something,&quot; said Ferridge.</p>
<p>&quot;We are starting to see a slight re-assessment of the economy. But only the early stages of that,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The FOMC meets at 1300 GMT on Tuesday with no announcement seen before Wednesday. Economists surveyed in a Reuters poll were unanimous in predicting no change in rates after the Fed's two-day policy meeting. All 36 analysts polled on said the FOMC would keep the federal funds rate steady at 5.50 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is generally well bid...It is in a general uptrend,&quot; said a trader at a Danish bank.</p>
<p>Overall, said analysts, the dollar continues to benefit from its safe-haven status as investors anticipate a soft euro when it is launched in 1999.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark was also propped earlier after Jiro Ushio, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, told a news conference on Tuesday that Japan's official discount rate should not be raised in the coming three to four months, Jiji news agency reported.</p>
<p>&quot;There are views among manufacturers that it would be OK to raise the interest rate, but weaker firms are being supported by low interest rates,&quot; Jiji quoted Ushio as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to say to what degree (the rate should be raised), but it should not be raised in the coming three to four months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, sterling slipped in Europe - after charging to new five-year highs of 2.91 marks in overnight dealings - after the UK's purchasing managers' index at 53.4 against 54.4 in May. The output index fell to 55.0, its lowest rate so far this year.</p>
