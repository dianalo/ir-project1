<title>DENMARK: Danish shares slip but outlook seen bright.</title>
<headline>Danish shares slip but outlook seen bright.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-03-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish share prices closed down on Wednesday, but comments from U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and underlying firm sentiment cushioned the falls and dealers expected an upturn on Thursday.</p>
<p>Greenspan earlier denied that he had been trying to talk markets down in recent statements hinting at rate cuts. He is due to speak again in congressional testimony at 1900 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The market righted itself somewhat after lunch because of Alan Greenspan's comments and we expect it to rise on Thursday,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index fell 0.24 point to 115.64.  </p>
<p>Overall bourse turnover was 1.61 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The KFX March future fell 0.40 point to 155.60 with 663 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>The top 20 logged four shares unchanged, nine down and seven up, with none of the movements very dramatic.</p>
<p>About the sharpest was Copenhagen Airports' 2.2 percent, 15-crown, rise to 685 crowns ahead of what are expected to be strong 1996 annual results to be published on Thursday.</p>
<p>Tele Danmark slipped four crowns to 353, but dealers said it could well rebound on Thursday. --Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33 969650</p>
