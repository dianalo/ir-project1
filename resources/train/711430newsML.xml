<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets early Monday were inactive as packers evaluated needs and surveyed feedlot inventories following the three-day Independence Day holiday weekend, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Favorable weather across the nation's midsection and widespread retail beef promotions last week could spark retail fill-in buying this week, which was seen keeping fed cattle prices steady at $63.00 per cwt, several feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Beef movement will be the key to this market the next three to four weeks and it looks like we should have had great movement over the weekend,&quot; a Panhandle feedlot manager said.  </p>
<p>Packer bids were expected to surface at $61.00 to $62.00 per cwt but were not expected to be very widespread, sources said. Owners were pricing cattle at $63.00 to $65.00.</p>
<p>The bulk of last week's cattle sales in the central and southern Plains were at $63.00 on Tuesday, with a few heifers at $62.00 in Kansas on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Attempts at maintaining steady prices this week could be blunted by outlooks for increased cattle supplies this month, sources said. Most feedlots were said to be near current, with a few cattle carried over from last week.</p>
<p>Early estimates for this week's showlists were steady to larger, compared with last week, the sources said.</p>
