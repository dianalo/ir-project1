<p>The United Arab Emirates is seeking support from other Arab countries before acting on its offer to mediate an end to the conflict in Sudan, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>UAE President Sheikh Zaid Bin Sultan al-Nahayan told his Sudanese counterpart Omar Hassan al-Bashir on Monday the Gulf Arab state was willing to send an envoy to mediate in the month-long conflict along Sudan's eastern border.</p>
<p>The telephone conversation was the first between the two leaders since Sheikh Zaid, who frequently calls for Arab unity and reconciliation, offered last month to mediate in Sudan, a move welcomed by the Arab League.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not take any actual moves regarding Sudan before we receive the opinion of the Arab countries because we do not want to take an initiative on our own,&quot; a UAE official told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have expressed our desire to mediate and our readiness to send an envoy. Now we are awaiting the responses of the Arab countries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arab diplomats said the success of the initiative, the strongest so far, hinged on reactions from Sudan's Islamist-led government and the Sudanese opposition. Neither has given any clear response.</p>
<p>Though few Arab states appear sympathetic to Khartoum's Islamist government, most have said they backed Sudan's unity and sovereignty. Many, including Egypt, have indicated they would not intervene in what they consider an internal crisis.</p>
<p>Sudan has relations ranging from bad to bellicose with its African neighbours.</p>
<p>It has accused Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda of direct military involvement in the rebel offensive launched in early January from the south and east by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and allied opposition forces. The three states deny such allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that the Sudanese are confused and this could harm the UAE's or any other initiative,&quot; said one Gulf Arab diplomat. &quot;Neither the government nor the opposition appear ready to set aside years of hatred and give in to find a political solution.&quot;</p>
