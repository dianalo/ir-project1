<p>Communications satellites in space and television reception on Earth could be damaged by an imminent burst of solar flare activity, an expert said Friday.</p>
<p>Astrophysicist Piers Corbyn of Weather Action, a weather forecasting company, said powerful emissions of high energy particles and radiation will burst out from the sun between June 28 and July 3.</p>
<p>This solar action also has implications for the Earth's weather, but this won't manifest itself for weeks or maybe months, Corbyn said.</p>
<p>There are about 250 satellites in geostationary orbit 22,500 miles over the equator, most of them handling telephone and television communications.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the present and recent low level of solar activity we expect at least 10 solar flares in this period (between June 28 and July 3),&quot; Corbyn said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;These will shoot high energy particles to Earth which are likely to cause interference to communications and damage to space satellites.&quot;</p>
<p>Weather Action produces weather forecasts based on the sun's activity. It does not disclose details of its methods.</p>
<p>Corbyn had forecast in April that there would be solar storm activity in May. Solar flares erupted on the sun on May 27, although there were no reports of major damage to satellites.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration also warned in April that a solar storm was about to hit the Earth with the potential to disrupt satellites and power grids.</p>
<p>NASA said highly charged ionised particles from the sun might strike a glancing blow at the magnetic field that protects the Earth about 100 miles from its surface. But this solar storm turned out to be a dud, with the huge magnetic cloud from the sun missing the Earth.</p>
<p>A similar storm in January may have caused the failure of a $200 million AT&amp;T Corp. communications satellite, a NASA spokesman said.</p>
