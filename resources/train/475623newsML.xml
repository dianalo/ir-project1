<title>BOSNIA: Bosnian cardinal makes Easter call for tolerance.</title>

<p>Bosnia's Roman Catholic cardinal issued an emotional appeal for an end to religious intolerance and hatred in his Easter message on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are tired of hatred. We are tired of injustice, provocations, destruction of churches and mosques, torching of religious symbols,&quot; Cardinal Vinko Puljic told worshippers at an Easter mass in the Sarajevo cathedral.</p>
<p>&quot;We are fed up with this. Stop it. We want to live. Stop imposing hatred. We want a human being to be a human being,&quot; Puljic said in remarks broadcast on state television.</p>
<p>Puljic's appeal follows a spate of attacks over the past two months on religious buildings, including several Catholic churches across Bosnia's troubled Moslem-Croat federation.</p>
<p>A bomb exploded at the back door of a Catholic church in Sarajevo's city centre earlier this month. Last Friday, a mosque was hit by a rifle grenade near the western town of Livno in Croat-controlled territory.</p>
<p>Tensions have been running high between the federation partners since Croats opened fire on unarmed Moslems trying to visit a cemetery in Croat-controlled western Mostar last month.</p>
<p>Sarajevo police say they have taken elaborate security precautions for the scheduled visit to the capital by Pope John Paul II on April 12.</p>
<p>The Pontiff had to cancel a planned visit during the 1992-95 Bosnian war because Serb forces laying siege to the city declined to offer security pledges.</p>
