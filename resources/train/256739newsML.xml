<headline>YEAREND - German bank merger talk to persist in 97.</headline>

<p>Last month Martin Kohlhaussen, head of Frankfurt-based Commerzbank AG, was spotted eating his breakfast in a Munich hotel.</p>
<p>He was there only to attend the supervisory board meeting of a construction company.</p>
<p>But his mere presence in Munich was enough to spark rumours that he was in talks with a big Bavarian bank and helped reignite speculation about mergers and takeovers that has beset the entire German banking sector since the summer.</p>
<p>Commerzbank's shares, which were also boosted by renewed rumours that it would be taken over by a foreign bank, rose almost seven percent in just three days and were among the most heavily traded in Germany.</p>
<p>The episode illustrates how sensitive the stock market has become to the possibility of consolidation.</p>
<p>Analysts insist that while mergers among Germany's top banks are unlikely to be imminent, they may happen in the coming years and speculation will persist in 1997 and beyond.</p>
<p>Market talk of mergers took off on July 10, when Deutsche Bank AG, the country's largest bank, disclosed it had amassed a 5.21 percent stake in Bayerische Vereinsbank AG, shares of which have soared almost 60 percent since.</p>
<p>Deutsche has said the move was aimed at deterring potential bidders for Vereinsbank and that it had no immediate plans to increase the stake. But sources say it has since bought more Vereinsbank shares. Deutsche would have to declare any rise in its shareholding above 10 percent.</p>
<p>Many analysts now recommend holding on to Vereinsbank shares even though they are regarded as hopelessly overvalued at their present level of around 63 marks.</p>
<p>Shares in Vereinsbank and in fellow Munich bank Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG (Hypo-Bank), have been the main beneficiaries of the speculation. Hypo-Bank shares have risen almost 30 percent since Deutsche's announcement.</p>
<p>RATIONALE BEHIND MERGERS SPECULATION</p>
<p>While senior bankers have sought to quash the market talk, the rationale behind mergers is clear.</p>
<p>Germany is regarded as heavily overbanked with more than 3,600 commercial, public and cooperative banks battling for market share, and a rate of one branch per 1,100 inhabitants.</p>
<p>The top five banks, led by giant Deutsche Bank, command a combined market share of just 14 percent and are struggling to make their cost-laden retail branch networks more efficient.</p>
<p>Their return on equity, lower than 10 percent after tax in most cases, is well below British, U.S. and Dutch banks -- too low to keep shareholders happy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, analysts see pressure on prices and costs mounting if European monetary union boosts cross-border competition. Mergers could pave the way for branch closures and other cost savings on the required scale, they say.</p>
<p>They therefore see a distinct possibility that the &quot;Big Five&quot; -- Deutsche, Dresdner Bank AG, Commerzbank, Vereinsbank and Hypo-Bank -- may become the Really Big Three by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Deutsche could join forces with Vereinsbank while Dresdner could link up with Hypo-Bank, analysts say. The moves could make strategic sense as Deutsche and Dresdner are strong in investment banking while Vereinsbank and Hypo-Bank lean to mortgage banking.</p>
<p>Also, insurer Allianz AG Holding, which owns stakes of 22 percent each in Dresdner and Hypo-Bank, may put pressure on the two banks to get together, analysts added.</p>
<p>&quot;The scenario that we will only have three top banks by the year 2000 is quite conceivable, it can't be ruled out,&quot; said Stefan Ermisch, banking analyst at WestLB in Duesseldorf.</p>
<p>BANKS HAVE LITTLE ENTHUSIASM FOR MERGERS NOW</p>
<p>But analysts see little enthusiasm among banks for mergers right now.</p>
<p>&quot;None of the banks are willing yet to take the view that they can't survive on their own,&quot; said Bryan Crossley, banking analyst at ABN Amro Hoare Govett in London.</p>
<p>&quot;They are still profitable, they are big, and they all want to run their own shop.&quot;</p>
<p>The top five had profit gains of between 10 and 37 percent in the first nine months of 1996, buoyed by a bull run on financial markets this year.</p>
<p>And all are pursuing their own, albeit similar, strategies to make their retail businesses more efficient by forming telephone bank units, merging branches and shedding jobs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile analysts dismiss recurring stock market speculation that Commerzbank may be acquired by Swiss Bank Corp, Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Suisse, or HSBC Holdings.</p>
<p>The analysts agree with Commerzbank's argument that it is too expensive to be a takeover candidate -- it has a market capitalisation of about 15 billion marks ($9.71 billion).</p>
<p>Besides, analysts say, Swiss banks are too busy dealing with their own inefficient branch networks to want to take another one on board.</p>
<p>Top bankers are keen to stress that the myriad savings banks and cooperative banks as well as state-owned banks are in far greater need of consolidation than the private sector.</p>
<p>Events so far confirm that theory.</p>
<p>The main merger activity at present concerns publicly owned regional banks, and the 607 savings banks readily admit they will have to close branches and, in many cases, merge.</p>
<p>Last week Germany's largest savings bank, Hamburger Sparkasse, said it had bid for 51 percent of Hamburgische Landesbank which has total assets of some 100 billion marks and is 100 percent owned by the city of Hamburg.</p>
<p>And another regional German bank, Norddeutsche Landesbank, has said it will next year start serious talks on a possible merger with Bankgesellschaft Berlin, which is 56.8 percent-owned by the state of Berlin, in a move which could create one of Germany's biggest banks. ($1=1.5453 Mark)</p>
