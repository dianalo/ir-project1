<title>FRANCE: French truckers dismantle roadblocks, deals signed.</title>
<headline>French truckers dismantle roadblocks, deals signed.</headline>

<p>Truck drivers lifted most of their roadblocks across France Friday after unions signed a deal with employers on early retirement and reported progress on pay and work-time claims to end a 12-day strike.</p>
<p>The truckers began voting with their wheels ahead of the weekend even before negotiations ended in Paris, lifting many of the blockades that have strangled the economy and forced petrol rationing in half the country.</p>
<p>By 5.30 p.m. local time, 2-1/2 hours after talks ended at the Transport Ministry, the number of roadblocks had fallen to 46 from 249 on Thursday and an official at the national traffic information centre said they were &quot;just melting away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our feeling is that our profession has won dignity and recognition in these 12 days of struggle,&quot; said Claude Debons, spokesman for the biggest union, the Socialist-led CFDT.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe, calling for a rapid return to normal, said, &quot;I am happy that the efforts made by all negotiating partners are now apparently crowned by success. I think a balanced solution has been found.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as the truckers began going home, unions for oil industry workers said they would consult their members about staging their own disruptions at refineries across the country to press their demands over pay, retirement age and job cuts.</p>
<p>That call came as roadblocks around major oil refineries near Nantes, Nice and Strasbourg were lifted, and authorities reported trucks leaving the key Berre refineries near Marseille.</p>
<p>The industry ministry said up to 10,000 gasoline stations -- more than half of the nation's 18,000 -- had run dry or were about to close, and it would take two to three days for supplies to resume fully.</p>
<p>Negotiators for the truckers had signed five agreements calling for retirement at 55 instead of 60 for drivers with 25 years' service, sick pay, travel expenses, union rights and a ban on Sunday driving.</p>
<p>The employers doubled their offer of a special bonus payment to 3,000 francs ($600) and the government promised a decree on work time within two weeks to meet key demands for full payment for hours worked, including unloading time and compulsory rest.</p>
<p>The unions said that would be equivalent to at least a 10 percent pay rise.</p>
<p>While the end of the strike removed the risk of wider economic damage, political commentators said it had highlighted Juppe's weakness, with both sides leaning on the government to sign checks to settle the dispute.</p>
<p>The state made most of the concessions in the private sector dispute by agreeing to cut payroll taxes on employers and help finance early retirement for truckers. It also had to step in to resolve the working hours issue by decree.</p>
<p>Unions voiced satisfaction with a draft decree which they said went a long way towards meeting their thorniest demand -- the abolition of longstanding practices whereby truckers are paid for fewer hours than they actually work.</p>
<p>The strike in the crucial pre-holiday commercial period cost European food and haulage industries tens of millions of dollars a day, prompting protests from France's neighbours.</p>
<p>It stranded up to 14,000 Spanish trucks and left about 90 percent of Portugal's total truck fleet idle. Belgian ports were clogged by British-bound trucks avoiding France.</p>
<p>The roadblocks have forced some French factories to close down for lack of supplies and cut deliveries of perishable goods ranging from fish to fruit and flowers. In Rouen, in Normandy, 9,000 workers from various sectors were temporarily laid off.</p>
