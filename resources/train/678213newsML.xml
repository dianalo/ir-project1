<headline>CRICKET-INDIA ORDERS INQUIRY INTO MATCH-FIXING CLAIMS.</headline>
<dateline>CALCUTTA, India 1997-06-21</dateline>

<p>The Indian cricket board on Saturday ordered an inquiry into allegations of match-fixing and betting.</p>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jagmohan Dalmiya told reporters former Supreme Court Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud would probe the allegations.</p>
<p>Among claims to be examined is one by former test player Manoj Prabhakar that he was offered money to &quot;throw&quot; a match three years ago.</p>
<p>Dalmiya, who has taken over as the International Cricket Council (ICC) president, steps down as BCCI secretary on July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that everyone will extend co-operation for proper conduct of the inquiry considering the seriousness of the charges and in the interest of the country,&quot; he said. &quot;The BCCI will not spare anyone found guilty of match-fixing.</p>
<p>&quot;But if the allegations are not proved, the Board will take appropriate action against those responsible for spreading such malicious and motivated rumours to tarnish the image of Indian cricket.&quot;</p>
<p>Prabhakar recently told India's Outlook magazine that he was offered 2.5 million Indian rupees ($70,000) by a teammate to sabotage a match in favour of Pakistan during the Singer Cup limited-over series in Sri Lanka in 1994.</p>
<p>Former Indian team manager Ajit Wadekar issued a statement saying that he had kept a watch on the cricketers but found nothing to substantiate allegations of bribery and involvement with bookmakers.</p>
