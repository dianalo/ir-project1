<p>U.S. spot natgas prices dropped sharply Friday as forecasts called for mostly above-normal temperatures to follow this cold weekend, sources said.</p>
<p>Swing prices on the Gulf Coast pipes fell by more than 30 cents to about $2.60 per mmBtu, down about $1.30 from January indices.</p>
<p>Similarly in south Texas, prices tumbled by about 35 cents to the $2.45-2.50 area, though there were some late buyers scrambling for weekend supplies shortly before nomination deadlines.  </p>
<p>In the Midcontinent, prices also softened by 35 cents to an average range of $2.45-2.50 despite below-normal temperatures now in the region and storage still lagging behind year-ago levels.</p>
<p>Revised reports that cold temperatures may continue in the Midwest through next week resulted in some late buying on the Midcontinent pipes. Weather Services Corp said cold temperatures may avoid the Great Lakes region later next week and move into the Northeast.</p>
<p>Chicago city-gate values were talked equally lower in the $2.90-2.95 range as cold temperatures continued in the area.</p>
<p>In west Texas, Permian prices were down about 30 cents to about $2.40, with deals reported done anywhere from $2.30 to $2.50.</p>
<p>Houston Lighting and Power's 1,250 megawatt South Texas 1 nuclear power unit is expected to shut this weekend, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.</p>
<p>Prices at the southern California border also fell almost 30 cents to $2.50-2.57.</p>
<p>In the East, prices hovered in the $3.30-3.40 range as the region anticipated colder temperatures Sunday and Monday.</p>
