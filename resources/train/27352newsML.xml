<p>An inquest in Cyprus has ruled that the death of a Greek Cypriot Kurd activist two years ago was premeditated murder, but avoided stating who was responsible for the death.</p>
<p>The inquest ruling into the death of Cypriot Theofilos Georgiades was given to the Cypriot Attorney General on Monday after inquiries lasting more than two years.</p>
<p>During the inquest hearing witnesses had stated that Georgiades was killed by Greek Cypriots who had been recruited by the Turkish Secret Service, known as MIT.</p>
<p>Georgiades, 37, representative of the Nicosia-based Kurdistan Solidarity Committee, was gunned down outside his home at a Nicosia suburb in March 1994 by an unknown killer.</p>
<p>Witnesses had testified during the inquest that a convict serving a life sentence at Nicosia central prison was recruited by the Turks to seek a person to carry out the killing.</p>
<p>The inquest stated it was impossible to reach any findings based on the witnesses' statements without the possibility of the persons named answering the charges in a trial.</p>
<p>The person witnesses said was the killer disappeared two months after Georgiades's murder, and was later found shot dead on a remote mountainside in the southern Limassol district.</p>
