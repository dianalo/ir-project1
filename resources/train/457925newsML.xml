<p>Thai players engaged in a bout of fresh buying on Thursday for RSS3 grade rubber while more buyers were said to flock for SIR20 rubber as prices slid in Palembang in Indonesia, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were some Thai buyers who purchased their April and May requirements and bought RSS3 at 121.25 (U.S.) cents (a kg) for April and 122.25 cents for May,&quot; a dealer for a rubber trading house said.</p>
<p>The slide in Palembang in Indonesia of SIR20 rubber prices also drew attention, the traders said. &quot;We got some buyers when it fell to 50 (U.S.) cents a lb,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Another trader said some of the deals done were seen at &quot;around 50-7/8 cents,&quot; he said. Malaysian exporters also sold about 400-500 tonnes of SMR20 rubber at about 287-288 Malaysian cents (a kg), traders said.</p>
<p>One dealer for a commodity house predicted prices may head lower in May/June after the end of wintering in the next few weeks. &quot;I think we could see more pressure on prices then. We'll see more fun and games after wintering,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At around 0945 GMT, May RSS3 was seen at 122.25 U.S. cents a kg from 122.00 cents.</p>
