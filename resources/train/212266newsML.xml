<p>The Zairean rebels who control the eastern part of the country bordering Rwanda on Saturday allowed in officials of international relief organisations for talks on the refugee crisis in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;We informed actual officials here about our intentions and our plans to assess the situation with refugees,&quot; Mans Nyberg, an official for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that we will be allowed to start with our assessments today,&quot; he told Reuters during a break in the talks.</p>
<p>Nyberg said earlier that there were hundreds of thousands of Hutus left in eastern Zaire after a massive refugee exodus earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe hundreds of thousands of refugees are there but we have no independent information as to what their situation is like and where most of them are stationed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The negotiating team, allowed into Zaire after at least two weeks of waiting at the border post in the Rwandan town of Cyangugu just over the border from Bukavu, comprised members from international relief bodies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, World Food Programme, Medecins sans Frontieres and others.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebels say there were not many refugees left and that they did not need any assistance from international bodies,&quot; one relief official said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are worried that an international aid operation might incur a military operation by Western countries,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;One must admit that most of the refugees could be further west, in the areas which are currently under the control of the Zaire government,&quot; another member of the delegation said.</p>
