<p>Shares of Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd continued their strong rally on Monday on heavy volume, with players crowding to buy into potentially lucrative development opportunities in China's capital.</p>
<p>The stock rocketed HK$9.55, or 21.13 percent, to close the morning session at HK$54.75. It topped the most-traded list with 30.60 million shares worth HK$1.53 billion changing hands.</p>
<p>Brokers said fund managers who were unable to subscribe for the shares in the initial public offer in May were accumulating positions, while some institutions were seen interested in issuing cover warrants on the shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Beijing Enterprises has outperformed other Chinese municipal-government controlled stocks and window companies,&quot; said Sean Li, associate director at Amsteel Securities.</p>
<p>But the shares were easily squeezed as sellers were few in the market, he added.</p>
<p>Beijing Enterprises, which is controlled by the Beijing municipal government, offered 150 million new shares globally at HK$12.48 each. Its 13.5 million share public offer in Hong Kong was subscribed at a record level of 1,267 times.</p>
<p>The shares rose to HK$40.20 at the close of their trading debut on Thursday.</p>
