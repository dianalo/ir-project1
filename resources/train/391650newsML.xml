<p>The Italian lira, undermined by EMU worries in the last few days, returned to its central parity of 990 per mark in late trading after wobbling close to the 1,000 barrier earlier in the week.</p>
<p>By 1557 GMT, the currency was quoted at 990.90/1.25 per mark after briefly touching 990.00. Traders said the lira had been helped by a strengthening dollar against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop-losses were triggered in the 992 area, and the lira rallied to 990,&quot; one foreign exchange dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who was too long of marks after Monday's strong movement preferred to take profits before the inflation data,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Preliminary February inflation data is due from six sample cities after 1630 GMT today with a further five reporting figures on Friday. Economists forecast a month on month rate of 0.2 percent, the same as January, and a year on year rate of 2.5 percent, slightly below January's 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>There was talk from some the Bank of Italy had been asking prices in the course of the day to discourage lira sellers although others had not felt the central bank's presence.</p>
