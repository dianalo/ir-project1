<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) looks set to pick Rome ahead of Athens as the venue for the 2004 Summer Games, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>But sports professionals outside the IOC's lofty ranks, if they had their own way, would pick Stockholm by a wide margin, according to the exclusive survey of Olympic sports federations, sponsors and journalists who follow the Games.</p>
<p>The continents of Africa and South America both look set to be deprived once more of hosting the Games for the first time, with Buenos Aires and Cape Town, the two remaining candidates in the five-city race, both being deemed rank outsiders.</p>
<p>&quot;Rome has the best, most proficient national Olympic committee in the world. It also has a great history and tradition in terms of sport,&quot; said one respondent who picked Rome as both the IOC's choice and his personal preference.</p>
<p>The IOC meets on September 5 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to choose the winner from the five-city shortlist. Reuters asked all international summer Olympic sports federations, plus principal sponsors and prominent journalists, to take part.</p>
<p>Fourteen replies were received. Because of the highly sensitive nature of the questions, all respondents except one chose to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>The survey tipped Rome as the IOC's choice because of superb facilities and strong backing from local people.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be a deep-seated desire and support for the Games. Rome has clearly demonstrated that,&quot; said Ed Hula, editor of Olympic newsletter Around the Rings.</p>
<p>International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) president Primo Nebiolo, an influential IOC member, hails from Italy. Although he has kept a low profile in his capital city's bid, respondents felt he would have a lot of clout when it came to the vote.</p>
<p>&quot;Nebiolo is a powerful force in the IOC. IOC president (Juan Antonio) Samaranch has had the Olympics in his home city of Barcelona and now Nebiolo might like to have it in his city of Rome,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;Also life on the Via Veneto would be very pleasant for IOC members and their wives,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A winning city must gain more than 50 percent of the votes from the IOC -- voting goes in rounds, with the least popular selection being drummed out each time until a winner is declared.</p>
<p>Greece, birthplace of the Olympic movement, would be a sentimental favourite but Athens, with its environmental problems, will be hard pushed to oust Rome, the survey found.</p>
<p>&quot;Greece has contributed so much to the Olympic movement. Everybody recognises that and everybody would like to offer Athens this reward for what it has done for the movement,&quot; said Hula.</p>
<p>&quot;People are concerned about traffic and pollution. When they bid for the 1996 Olympics they were very arrogant about it and they lost a lot of friends,&quot; another respondent said.</p>
<p>Yet if the respondents could choose the venue themselves, a two-thirds majority would go for clean, cool Stockholm. After the sweaty chaos of Atlanta, athletes and spectators alike would welcome the north European air, while the long summer days would appeal to television companies.</p>
<p>But the contributors estimated that the IOC would rank the Swedish capital only in third place because planet-friendly Swedes worried about the environment may mount opposition to the Games.</p>
<p>A recent opinion poll showed that 52 percent of the city's population were opposed to the bid and this could push the IOC towards Rome or Athens.</p>
<p>&quot;The IOC would be very wary to give it to a city where there wasn't very strong public support,&quot; said one panellist.</p>
<p>Only one of the contributors went out on a limb, thinking the IOC would give Cape Town a chance.</p>
<p>&quot;Africa's never held the Olympics and there is a view that it should be encouraged,&quot; said one respondent.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is concern about safety issues and whether it is too early for South Africa financially,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>The Olympics is a vast investment for a country to undertake and panellists were concerned that Cape Town would be better spending money on other community facilities.</p>
<p>The IOC will be keen to avoid a repeat of the mediocrity at Atlanta, which was slammed in the world press for disastrous transportation and poor organisation.</p>
<p>For that reason, Rome looks a safe bet for the IOC.</p>
<p>&quot;The IOC doesnt want a volatile situation,&quot; said one respondent. &quot;Members want a venue with stability in terms of the organisation, in terms of the country and in terms of the city. They'll get that with Rome.&quot;</p>
