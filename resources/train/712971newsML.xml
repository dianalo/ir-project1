<headline>Brazil soy traders dismiss talk of old crop buying.</headline>

<p>Brazilian traders said rumors that a Brazilian firm was bidding for old crop soybeans in Chicago Tuesday were unlikely to be true but added that China may have bought Brazilian soymeal in the last few days.</p>
<p>Talk of a local firm bidding for the old crop beans was dismissed, with traders saying the trade would not make any sense at current prices and there was still some offer in Brazil despite record exports this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We've suddenly found in the last couple of days it's become a bit tighter but there's plenty of product around,&quot; said David Brew, trader at Brasoja.</p>
<p>&quot;With the cost of bringing them down here, there's no way (U.S. beans) are going to be competitive with local beans,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dealers also noted a small easing in soymeal premiums and reported talk that China had bought a cargo of Brazilian meal in the last few days, as well as buying U.S. beans and meal.</p>
<p>&quot;There's talk China bought 200,000 tonnes beans and meal including one cargo of soymeal from Brazil,&quot; said Michael McDougall, director of commodities futures at Fimat Futures.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people were getting nervous because the premiums have risen over the last few days, but now they're coming down so it's likely something has gone through,&quot; said Brew.</p>
<p>Processor Ceval Alimentos said it had bought back last week 50,000 tonnes soybeans which it had sold when Chicago futures peaked earlier this year, making a profit on the recent drop in prices.</p>
<p>&quot;It's merely a paper position, it wasn't even registered as export,&quot; said director of external sales Charles van der Heyde.</p>
<p>Ceval also bought 60,000 tonnes U.S. soybeans for November and December shipment to the southern ports of Rio Grande and Sao Francisco do Sul, he added.</p>
