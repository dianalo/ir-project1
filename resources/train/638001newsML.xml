<p>NYMEX electricity futures are called to open lower Wednesday, extending this week's steep drop on outlook of seasonal temperatures and more generation capacity returning to operation in the West.</p>
<p>&quot;Definitely lower, but nothing dramatic,&quot; said a West Coast electricity dealer.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter activity, July California-Oregon Border (COB) futures were quoted at $16.90-17.10 a megawatt hour (MWh) down from Tuesday's settlement at $17.61, and July Palo Verde (PV) $26.40-27.00 below yesterday's close at $27.66.</p>
<p>So far this week, July COB lost $6.83 or 27.9 percent of their value, while July PV fell $5.80 or 17.4 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts pegged short-term support for July COB at $17.00 and for July PV at $27.00 after they violated their uptrend lines on yesterday's drop.</p>
<p>If the front month contracts maintain technical support, they could head for a rebound and fill the chart gaps at $19.25-20.25 for July COB and $28.30-30.30 for July PV.</p>
<p>Market sources said a firming of natural gas futures would help halt the power complex's decline.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll slow the fall. It'll lend it support,&quot; said the West Coast dealer.</p>
<p>NYMEX July Henry Hub natgas futures opened 4.2 cents at $2.140 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Two West nuclear power units, 1,087 megawatt (MW) Diablo Canyon 1 and 1,221 MW Palo Verde 3, are in the process of returning to full output. following outages.</p>
<p>Arizona Public Service said Tuesday Palo Verde 3 would hold at 35 percent power for a few more days and ramp up to full output Friday.</p>
<p>Diablo Canyon 1 was at 30 percent output Wednesday morning, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.</p>
<p>A 750 MW unit at the Four Corners coal-fired plant in New Mexico was expected to restart at midnight Tuesday.</p>
<p>But a 550 MW unit at the Bridger coal-fired complex in Wyoming will shut Wednesday and stay down until Sunday for planned maintenance, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the West were called to average near to slightly above normal into early next week with above normal precipitation in the eastern sections of the Northwest and northern areas of the Southwest.</p>
