<title>UK: FORECAST - Copper drop hits RTZ-CRA.</title>
<headline>FORECAST - Copper drop hits RTZ-CRA.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Few investors await Thursday's first half results of RTZ-CRA with much optimism as a wave of broker profit downgrades left nobody in any doubt the mining giant has been hard hit by the Sumitomo copper crisis.</p>
<p>On average, analysts expect a 25 percent drop in net earnings of the Anglo-Australian company, due to smelter problems and the copper slump, triggered by the huge losses piled up by Sumitomo's rogue trader Yasuo Hamanaka.</p>
<p>Net adjusted earnings are forecast to fall between US$ 516 and $558 million, down from 711 million a year earlier, as copper dropped over 30 percent in the May to mid-July period.  </p>
<p>The figures are excluding any extraordinary items.</p>
<p>&quot;It's swimming against the copper tide,&quot; said analyst Emile Morfett at Paribas.</p>
<p>Copper, which is RTZ-CRA's main metal, was about 14 percent lower in 1996's first half than in the same 1995 period, pulled down by revelations that Hamanaka's unauthorised trades led to losses for Sumitomo of at least $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>Prices slipped to a low of $1,790 per tonne on July 12. Although they regained some ground after that, analysts do not expect prices to gain much more.  </p>
<p>&quot;Obviously the copper price has looked a little bit healtier in the last few weeks, but I still feel that the supply-demand situation is not particularly supportive over the next 18 months,&quot; said David Ireland at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.</p>
<p>The price weakness in the weeks immediately after the first-half end, at June 30, will have likely hit the interim results by about $100 million, broker UBS said in a recent note.</p>
<p>This setback reflects a revaluation of provisionally priced shipments of copper to the price at the end of the reporting period. The adjustment is for copper which had been provisionally priced but not actually sold by June 30.  </p>
<p>Copper made up 23 percent of RTZ-CRA's 1995 revenues and, together with gold, represented 42 pct of that year's earnings.</p>
<p>RTZ-CRA, formed through a merger late last year, is one of the world's leading copper producers. It owns the Bingham Canyon mine in the U.S. and has major interests in huge projects such as Grasberg in Irian Jaya, Escondida in Chile and Neves Corvo in Portugal.</p>
<p>Apart from the Sumitomo crisis, RTZ-CRA's copper earnings will also have suffered from delays of the new Bingham Canyon smelter, which resulted in a stockpile of 70,000 tonnes of unsold copper on June 30.  </p>
<p>The company, which retained a dual listing in London and Sydney, will also have felt the impact of aluminium prices which slipped on copper's coat-tails, analysts said.</p>
<p>Aluminium, partly through the majority stake in Comalco, represented about 18 percent of RTZ-CRA's 1995 turnover and nearly 14 percent of earnings.</p>
<p>Sydney-listed Comalco last week reported a 72 percent drop in first-half net profit to A$43.9 million. Comalco said it was also hit by an adverse exchange rate between the Australian and U.S. dollar.</p>
