<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin had &quot;substantive and intense&quot; discussions on NATO and arms control on Friday but have not yet reached agreement, Clinton's spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot report to you at this point that they have reached any agreements,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters after the leaders met for two hours at the Finnish president's official residence overlooking the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>McCurry said work would continue on NATO and other issues and that the two presidents would discuss economic affairs over lunch, after a morning session lasting two hours.</p>
<p>Faced with bitter opposition from Moscow, Clinton had laid out his argument that NATO enlargement did not represent a threat to Russia &quot;with a great deal of passion and commitment&quot;, McCurry said.</p>
<p>&quot;They had a very substantive discussion. It was also described as being non-polemical.</p>
<p>&quot;This was not an argument between these two presidents but really a very candid and thorough review of their different positions done in a very amicable spirit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He refused to give concrete details of the talks, which were also attended by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. But McCurry said they were &quot;very lively, very intense&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Several (people) familiar with the meetings that these two presidents have had described it as by far the most substantive and intense discussion they have ever had,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that is befitting to the subject matter, talking about this relationship and the relationship both countries have to the continent of Europe as we think ahead to the 21st century,&quot; McCurry added.</p>
<p>But he added that the two men, who have developed a close personal chemistry, also joked about Clinton's restless night in his Helsinki hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a discussion that will evolve as the day goes on. They have had a very lively, a very intense, a very substantive conversation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>McCurry said the two leaders had not held any specific talks about which countries might join an enlarged NATO and were unlikely to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't really expect that they will get into specific countries with respect to the issue of membership,&quot; he said when asked if Clinton and Yeltsin has discussed NATO membership for the three Baltic countries.</p>
