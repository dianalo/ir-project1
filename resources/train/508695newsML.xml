<title>UK: IPE Brent closes sharply down after NYMEX falls.</title>
<headline>IPE Brent closes sharply down after NYMEX falls.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-15</dateline>

<p>IPE Brent futures closed lower on Tuesday on the back of a weaker NYMEX and on expectations of bearish U.S. oil inventory data, brokers said.</p>
<p>The May Brent contract, expiring at the end of Tuesday's session, last traded 23 cents a barrel down at $17.96. The June contract closed 20 cents a barrel down at $18.14.</p>
<p>The May WTI was last traded seven cents lower at $19.83 a barrel on NYMEX.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all pre-API action. That is why the oil complex is down across the board,&quot; said an oil dealer in Atlanta  </p>
<p>U.S. traders said they expected to see crude stocks for the week ended April 11 to rise by up to 3.5 million barrels in the American Petroleum Institute's (API) weekly report, due for release later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Continued strong growth in imports was the reason for the anticipated rise, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Weakness is setting into the States. I don't know if there is some API data which some people are sort of gambling on, which I guess is the case &quot; one IPE broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no follow through above $20.00 (for WTI). That is disappointing,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Brokers had said earlier that Brent futures were pressured downwards by some selling in the market. Two players were reported to have sold some 4,000 lots of the Brent June contract, trying to push it down.</p>
<p>One broker said that besides the reports of selling, the market was also pushed down by signs tension between Iran and the West was easing.</p>
<p>May Brent hit a high of $18.16 during the day but also dipped to a low of $17.84 in early trade.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the only thing that is disappointing is that we haven't been able to break out on the upside, whereas we could have done that and it would have looked good, but we haven't,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;So the failure of the market to break out and make new highs is the disappointing part but I am not saying abandon ship all is lost,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, May gas oil futures settled 25 cents a tonne higher at $165.25, shedding slight losses in earlier trade. June gas oil also settled 25 cents higher at $166.25. --Haitham Haddadin, London newsroom +44 171 542 8145</p>
