<p>Investigations into the Nomura Securities payoff and racketeer scandal spread to one of Japan's largest commercial banks while speculation grew about whether politicians were among Nomura clients who received preferential treatment, media reports said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Executives at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank were questioned by police prosecutors in connection to questionable loans to a principle figure in the Nomura scandal, the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun and other media reports said.</p>
<p>Ten top Dai-ichi Kangyo bankers were queried about 3.1 billion yen in unsecured loans the bank made in 1989 to Koike, a corporate racketter who used the funds to buy shares in Nomura and other companies, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Bank officials were not available for comment on Sunday.</p>
<p>Koike and his younger brother were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of taking 50 million yen ($431,000) in payments from Nomura after threatening to disrupt the company's 1995 annual meeting.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Shimpei Matsuki, 52, and Nobutaka Fujikura, 54, two former managing directors at Nomura, and Osamu Fujita, 58, a senior official in charge of shareholders meetings, were arrested in the scandal.</p>
<p>Payoffs to &quot;sokaiya&quot; or racketeers who extort money from companies by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings with awkward questions, violate the Commercial Code.</p>
<p>The government, in response to media reports that Nomura had thousands of VIP accounts whose owners received special treatment, said it would query cabinet ministers this week about the list.</p>
<p>Under opposition party questioning in parliament, Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said he would be responible for the cabinet investigation, but was against making the names on the list public.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a serious matter if incorrect information damaged their honour,&quot; Kajiyama said of the list.</p>
<p>Nomura has said the estimated 8,000-9,000 &quot;VIP accounts&quot; were for customers regarded as needing careful treatment to avoid any illegal stock trading and were not designed to give preferential treatment to certain customers.</p>
<p>Since the scandal broke in March after an internal probe, Nomura's president and 15 board members also resigned.</p>
<p>At the heart of the investigation is whether the firm's executive board was aware of the payoffs to Koike or whether the officials involved acted on their own.</p>
<p>Government officals are presenting the investigation as a warning to financial markets as a whole that the era of lax enforcement of regulations is over.</p>
<p>The scandal has already cost Nomura, a firm at the financial heart of Japan since the 19th century, some of its biggest clients as corporate and government clients have suspended business with it.</p>
