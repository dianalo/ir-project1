<p>The deputy chief of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was on Monday accused of bias and asked to step down from a special hearing into covert military aid to the Zulu-led Inkatha Freedom Party.</p>
<p>A lawyer representing former army general Andreas &quot;Kat&quot; Liebenberg said at the start of the two-week hearing that the commission's Alex Boraine had showed bias against Liebenberg and the security forces in recent public statements.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears that Dr Boraine has also come to certain fixed conclusions relating to the South African Defence Force and has made known his attitude in this regard in numerous statments to the public media,&quot; lawyer Etienne Coetzee said.</p>
<p>He said the interests of justice would be best served if Dr Boraine stepped down.</p>
<p>The commission rejected Coetzee's request.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the unanimous view of the panel not to accede to your application... We do not believe these hearings will prejudice your client or any other person,&quot; commissioner Richard Lyster said in reply.</p>
<p>Boraine told reporters afterwards the hearings were not a court of law and were intended to merely gather information.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that I am here makes no difference whatsoever to the witnesses and to those who make submissions. I cannot influence them in any way and wouldn't want to... I obviously reject any view that I am in anyway partial or biased.&quot;</p>
<p>Boraine, who is currently acting chairman of the commission while Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu is undergoing treatment for cancer in the U.S., has previously been accused of bias by the former ruling National Party.</p>
<p>The Durban hearing is probing covert military aid given to Inkatha by the former government in the mid-1980s to bolster the fight against the then-banned African National Congress (ANC).</p>
<p>Some 15,000 people have been killed in over a decade of politically-motivated violence in KwaZulu-Natal province.</p>
<p>Four Inkatha men, who were trained in Namibia's Caprivi Strip in 1986 along with another 200 men, began giving testimony on Monday about their recruitment and deployment in the region.</p>
<p>Over 70 people, including former state president P.W. Botha, ex-defence minister Magnus Malan and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi have been warned they will be implicated during the hearing. They did not attend on Monday, but sent their lawyers.</p>
<p>Malan and 19 generals, army and police officers and Inkatha members were tried -- and acquitted -- last year for the massacre of 13 people in 1987 which was allegedly carried out by the Caprivi trainees.</p>
