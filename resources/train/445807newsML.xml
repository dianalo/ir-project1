<headline>Clinton returns to White House after hospital stay.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-16</dateline>

<p>President Bill Clinton returned to the White House on Sunday after nearly 48 hours in the hospital for emergency surgery to repair a knee tendon injured in a freak accident.</p>
<p>&quot;He's feeling very good. He's delighted that the doctors agreed he could go home early,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry said as Clinton left Bethesda National Navy Medical Centre by mini-van for the 20-minute trip to the White House.  </p>
<p>Clinton, at 50 the youngest U.S. president since John Kennedy in the early 1960s, tore a tendon in his right knee early Friday when he  stumbled on a step at the Florida home of Australian golf professional Greg Norman.</p>
<p>The painful injury forced him to undergo surgery later the same day, and doctors say it will be weeks before he is fully mobile again. As Clinton left the hospital, the White House announced that his Helsinki summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin will start one day later than scheduled this week to give him more time to recuperate.</p>
<p>A Clinton visit to Denmark that was to have followed the summit is being postponed until July, it said.</p>
<p>Clinton was rolled into the White House in a wheelchair and was greeted by his wife Hillary with a big kiss. &quot;I feel fine today. I was a little sore yesterday, you know, the first day after the operation when the painkillers started to wear off,&quot; the smiling president told reporters.</p>
