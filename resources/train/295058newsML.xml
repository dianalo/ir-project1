<p>Japanese stocks finished at a 13-month low on Wednesday, reflecting the market's deepening despondency over the government's efforts to revive the flagging economy.</p>
<p>The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares shed 215.81 points or 1.14 percent to close at 18,680.38, its lowest close since November 29, 1995, when it ended at 18,533.98. March Nikkei futures fell 160 points to 18,720.</p>
<p>Mounting worries over construction firms and financial institutions, which are suffering from bad loan problems, overshadowed the market, brokers said, as shares in banks, securities firms and construction companies led the nosedive.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless shares in the (financial and building) sectors stop sliding, overall sentiment will not recover,&quot; said Michio Sugita, head of stock trading at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>The market's fall has fuelled worries of possible delays in write-offs of heavy bad debts held by banks and construction firms, as the drop has reduced the value of their share holdings, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market woes, sparked late last year by worries over a possible slowdown in Japan's economy in the first half of 1997, prompted hastier sales by investors already worried about government policies to boost the economy.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, speaking as the market was closing, acknowledged that a lack of confidence in the economy was driving the Nikkei down.</p>
<p>Some analysts and business officials saw the economy as firm, Mitsuzuka said, but it seemed from share price movements that the market did not share that view.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that stock prices are continuing to fall means we must keep careful watch,&quot; Mitsuzuka said.</p>
<p>Brokers said they were also discouraged by a comment by a Finance Ministry official which downplayed the market's gloomy outlook on the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think (recent stock declines) will lead to worries about the nation's financial system as a whole,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Brokers said the comment suggested that the financial authorities did not think it urgent to tackle the spreading worries over the economy.</p>
<p>Bucking the overall trend downward, however, were the global blue-chip issues, dubbed the &quot;Nifty 50&quot; for their ability to outperform the gloomy market.</p>
<p>Shares in Sony Corp gained 50 yen to close at 7,690 yen ($66), while Nikon Corp shares rose 40 yen to end at 1,530 yen ($13).</p>
<p>Advantest Corp soared 300 yen to 5,930 yen ($51) by the end of the session, ranking as the third-bigger percentage gainer on the first section. ($1=115 yen)</p>
