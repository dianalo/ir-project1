<p>Ten thousand demonstrators rallied in Belgrade on Sunday, two days before the autocratic President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists are expected to approve a bill reinstating opposition gains in local elections.</p>
<p>Milosevic told an Athens paper parliament should approve the bill recognising disputed results of the November polls.</p>
<p>&quot;I am optimistic that the bill will pass,&quot; Milosevic said in remarks published on Sunday. &quot;It will be approved. The problems related with the municipal elections, I believe, will be resolved generally in accordance with Serbian institutions.&quot;</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, after months of domestic street protests and international criticism, Milosevic suddenly announced he was asking parliament to approve the opposition wins in 14 towns and cities across Serbia, including Belgrade.</p>
<p>Milosevic's Socialists do not have an outright majority in their own right, but Milosevic usually manages to get his way with the help of ethnic minority parliamentarians.</p>
<p>Two days earlier, Milosevic had sent in his paramilitary police to clear demonstrators from downtown Belgrade's cobbled streets. Repeated baton charges left scores injured and raised an international outcry.</p>
<p>The opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition also has other demands, including the freeing of Serbian media from government influence and the independence of the judiciary.</p>
<p>Zajedno has said as soon as parliament passes the bill into law on Tuesday, it will call off the street rallies and start a dialogue with the authorities on its other demands.</p>
<p>But opposition co-leader Zoran Djindjic told a Budapest newspaper, Magyar Nezmet, that protests would go on if news broadcast by state radio and television failed to be objective, the official Tanjug news agency reported.</p>
<p>The opposition is also worried about the possibility of last-minute delay or subterfuge on the part of the Socialists.</p>
<p>Law professor Vesna Rakic-Vodinelic,  Zajedno's legal adviser, told B-92 independent radio there were questions over what the reinstatement of disputed or provisional municipal election results really meant.</p>
<p>&quot;In Serbia's city, Nis, no provisional results were ever declared,&quot; she said. &quot;...it never even declared anything that could be called preliminary results,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;In many municipalities these preliminary results do not cover all the seats in the local assembly. In Belgrade, for example, provisional results were declared for 100 seats out of the total of 110,&quot; she told B-92.</p>
<p>Witnesses said about 10,000 people turned out in hazy sunshine in central Belgrade to keep up their pressure on Milosevic, while Zajedno motorists took their cars on a political road rally into the countryside.</p>
<p>Reuters Television reported a cavalcade of about 1,200 cars, many with flags and posters, streaming through villages on the 36 km (22 mile) route between the towns of Kraljevo and Cacak, sounding their horns and cheering.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to stop in each village,&quot; said one young driver. &quot;We lost elections in these villages because they did not know what was going on. We'll stop to explain to people.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the drummers at the vanguard of Belgrade's daily student protests for the past 12 weeks have formed an eight-member group, &quot;Cultural Terrorism&quot;, to produce a compact disc entitled &quot;Drums of Belgrade&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;What these young men are doing is bringing back the old face and the old style and charm of Belgrade,&quot; said Vojislav Nesic, producer for the Hungarian HMK music company.</p>
