<p>U.S. mortgage delinquencies rose in the fourth quarter of 1996, breaking a string of three consecutive quarterly declines, according to a survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.</p>
<p>The overall seasonally adjusted delinquency rate on one- to four-unit homes was 4.37 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 4.16 percent in the previous quarter, the group said.</p>
<p>&quot;The rising growth in consumer debt, coupled with a moderating economy, could keep mortgage delinquencies from improving in the near future,&quot; MBA president Ron McCord said. &quot;We expect delinquency rates will hover near these levels over the next few quarters.&quot;</p>
<p>The 1996 fourth quarter rate was down slightly from the same period last year when the delinquency rate reached 4.48 percent.</p>
<p>Delinquency rates rose in three of the four regions of the country, MBA found. In the Northeast, the delinquency rate was 4.23 percent, a drop of one basis point from the third quarter and 36 basis points from a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the South, the rate was 5.02 percent, up 18 basis points from the third quarter.  </p>
<p>In the West, the rate was 3.69 percent, up 29 basis points from the third quarter.</p>
<p>In the North Central, the rate was 3.92 percent, up nine basis points from the previous quarter.</p>
<p>The delinquency rate for the fourth quarter rose in each past due category from the third quarter.</p>
<p>For 30-day delinquencies, the rate rose 12 basis point to 3.04 percent. For 60-days, the rate rose 6 basis points to 0.71 percent and for 90-days the rate rose 3 basis points to 0.62 percent.</p>
<p>Foreclosures rates rose for all but one type of loan from the previous quarter. The percentage of conventional loans in foreclosure at the end of the fourth quarter was 0.71 percent, up 3 basis points from the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>For FHA loans, the rate was 1.78 percent, up 6 basis points, and for VA loans the rate was unchanged at 1.62 percent.</p>
<p>The MBA survey covers about one-third of all residential mortgage loans outstanding in the United States, the group said.</p>
