<headline>Brazil shares end firm as Telebras surges.</headline>

<p>Brazilian stocks ended stronger in high turnover, powered by bellwether Telebras, which ended close to its day's highs on expectations of another telephone rate rise, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index of the 52 most traded shares closed up 1,231 at 62,948 points. Market volume was 542 million reais ($533.6 million), with Telebras shares and options accounting for 75 percent of today's trade.</p>
<p>Telebras preferred surged 4.31 percent, ending at 77.40 reais, despite a slight correction in prices during the session, traders said.  </p>
<p>The correction followed a denial by Telebras of press reports that Brasilia planned a 200 percent rise in Brazil's basic service rates in November.</p>
<p>The reports cited Telebras' president as saying basic residential rates would be raised to 11.22 reais.</p>
<p>&quot;A rate hike is planned for November, but no one can say at this point what it will be,&quot; a Telebras spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Telebras denied the 200 percent rate hike, but it did not deny that the rates will rise later this year,&quot; a senior trader said, adding that Telebras' comments helped to increase speculation with the company's shares.  </p>
<p>Analysts said market could continue rallying on Thursday, underpinned by Telebras stocks, but they noted some correction in prices is possible after today's sharp rise.</p>
<p>Telebras common shares rose 3.33 percent to end at 61.99 reais.</p>
<p>Other big winners were Companhia Vale do Rio Doce preferred rose 4.59 percent to end at 19.61 reais, Petrobras increased 1.69 percent to close at 120 reais and Cemig, which rose 3.03 percent, ending at 30.60 reais.  </p>
<p>Sao Paulo bourse's power sector index (IEE), which comprises the nine most liquid stocks of the electrical sector, closed up 1.45 percent at 1,533 points.</p>
