<p>China's aviation industry is booming with major expansion planned for growth in cargo and passenger traffic, and it is time for the West to relax its purse strings for funding, a senior official said Friday.</p>
<p>Hai Liancheng, finance chief at China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC), told a Geneva conference that his country expected to more than double its air fleet to 1,000 commercial aircraft by 2000.</p>
<p>China planned to order as many as 300 planes in the coming years, he said, but did not specify the type of planes or whether the orders would be firm or involve options.</p>
<p>&quot;Our industry has made progress but we still have a long way to go. The main focus is the shortage of funds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China's civil aviation industry has expanded rapidly in the past 16 years, growing by an average of 20.6 percent between 1980 and 1995. It was forecast to grow 14 percent annually through the end of the century.</p>
<p>As of Dec. 31, China had a total of 317 aircraft leased from the United States, Germany, France, Japan and other countries at a total cost of $11.8 billion.</p>
<p>The air fleet totalled 443 aircraft, including the leases, worth a total of $16 billion, Liancheng said.</p>
<p>&quot;By the year 2000, the number of aircraft in the entire industry will reach 1,000 and more,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The reputation of China's airlines has improved since 1994 when the International Airline Passenger Association cited the country as one of the most dangerous places in the world in which to fly after a string of crashes and hijackings.</p>
<p>In the following two years China did not have an aviation disaster. In 1996, its airlines set a record of 29 months, and 2.33 million hours, of safe flying, its officials said.</p>
<p>Liancheng said China expected to boost air passenger traffic to 100 million travelers and cargo traffic to 2 million tons by 2010 -- nearly doubling 1995 levels.</p>
<p>In 1996, China's airlines flew 55.5 million passengers, up 8.5 percent over a year earlier, while air cargo traffic grew more than 13 percent to 1.14 million tons.</p>
<p>Industry officials said that China still has a long way to go to catch up with the United States, Europe and Japan in passenger and cargo traffic.</p>
