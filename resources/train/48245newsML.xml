<p>Williams Cos, a natural gas pipeline group with a large telecommunications network, will announce a joint venture with the Public Broadcasting System Thursday to deliver business-education services to desktop computers, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Williams and PBS declined to comment, but PBS scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning in New York with an unidentified U.S. company listed among the Fortune 500 rankings of major American corporations.</p>
<p>Williams Cos operates an extensive system of fiber optic cables, commonly laid in unused energy pipelines, and will use the cables to deliver a wide array of training and educational programmes to businesses.</p>
<p>Industry sources said the services could save employers substantial sums in travel expenses and labour by making training much more accessible at worksites.</p>
<p>Typical offerings might be a review of new U.S. health regulations or a lecture by a leading business thinker.</p>
<p>The joint venture will also exploit the large library of educational programme held by PBS, one industry source said.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems, whose chief executive, Scott McNealy, is to appear at the news conference, will supply technology to the enterprise, a source said.</p>
