<headline>Moorfield details Greycoat merger plan.</headline>

<p>UK property group Moorfield Estates Plc said on Wednesday it had presented a more detailed merger proposal to its larger rival Greycoat Plc.</p>
<p>Moorfield first made an approach to Greycoat earlier this month but it was rejected by Greycoat as being &quot;vague as to value&quot;. Greycoat called for Moorfield to provide more detailed proposals so it could consider the plan.</p>
<p>Moorfield said in a statement that the merger would be through an offer by it for the entire ordinary share capital of Greycoat, made up new Moorfield ordinary shares and loan notes.  </p>
<p>&quot;The total value of the offer to Greycoat shareholders would be the current net asset value of Greycoat as established by an independent external valuation of its property assets,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The mix between ordinary shares and loan notes &quot;is intended to separate Greycoat shareholders' current investment into two separate interests on a tax effective basis&quot;, it added.</p>
<p>Moorfield said the planned loan note would be valued at about 110 million stg. This was estimated on the basis of historic information and set &quot;by reference to the value&quot; of Greycoat's two main assets, Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, net of the value of attributable debt.  </p>
<p>The company said the loan notes &quot;would give holders substantially all the economic interest in the Principal properties (present and future) whice are intended to be ring-fenced with a pool of capital losses&quot;.</p>
<p>It said the notes would yield &quot;substantially in excess of the current yield on Greycoat ordinary shares&quot; and their redemption value would be equivalent to the net value of the properties on realisation.</p>
<p>The loan notes represent a tax effective means of returning cash to shareholders on the subsequent sale or demerger of the properties, Moorfield said.  </p>
<p>The rest of the net asset value would be satisfied in new Moorfield shares and would result in the merger of Greycoat's portfolio, minus the principal properties.</p>
<p>Moorfield said the merger was subject to an independent property valuation of Greycoat's and Moorfield's property assets &quot;with the full co-operation of Greycoat&quot;, a limited due diligence excercise on Greycoat and a recommendation to Greycoat shareholders to accept the merger by the Greycoat board.</p>
<p>Moorfield, which said the proposals had been put to Greycoat via financial advisers, said the enlarged portfolio would give enhanced growth prospects for both companies' shareholders.  </p>
<p>There would also be savings on overheads, with a full year saving of around 1.5 million stg, Moorfield said, adding that a further announcement on &quot;the progress of discussions with the board of Greycoat will be made in due course&quot;.</p>
