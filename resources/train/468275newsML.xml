<title>USA: CSCE cocoa ends up, but off session highs.</title>
<headline>CSCE cocoa ends up, but off session highs.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended higher in sluggish dealings on Wednesday, bolstered by local buying and light speculative interest, market sources said.</p>
<p>Selling pressure by the trade, however, pared gains and kept the May contract from breaching key technical resistance at $1,475 a tonne, they added.</p>
<p>May futures peaked at $1,475 early on, but finished at $1,461, up $16 a tonne on the day. May reached a low of $1,457. Second-month July gained $18, to $1,489, while the remaining months were up $7 to $17.</p>
<p>A downturn in the U.S. dollar against the British pound also buoyed CSCE cocoa, as arbitrage favored cheaper prices on the dollar-denominated New York market, traders said.</p>
<p>But despite today's gains, dealers said the market appeared to be trading sideways in a range between $1,425 and $1,475 basis May, with interest in cocoa futures falling off. They noted the day's turnover was fairly light at an estimated 7,947 lots, down from Tuesday's official tally of 8,153 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a range,&quot; one trader said. &quot;We've been up here before and we're not exploding or attracting a lot of fund participation.&quot;</p>
<p>Abundant cocoa supplies and the improved prospects for the Ivory Coast midcrop after beneficial rains could keep a lid on the market, some traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is plenty of cocoa and it tempers the roaring bulls out here,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>But Refco analyst Ann Prendergast said a global cocoa deficit in 1996/97 and strong consumption should underpin the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ivorian crop is not going to be larger than last year,&quot; she said. &quot;With a deficit and growing consumption we could see a shortage in cocoa.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, traders said a breach of $1,475 basis May contract could lead to a test of $1,490. On the downside, near-term support was seen around $1,450.</p>
