<p>Croatian stocks were mixed on Tuesday with slight recovery among some blue chips and traders predicted the Christmas lull would keep most shares around the present level.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't expect drastic changes in any direction this week, or for that matter till the end of the year,&quot; said Josko Milisa of the IFC brokerage.</p>
<p>He said many investors were sorting out their books, and the end of December usually saw sluggish trade.</p>
<p>He singled out chocoloate maker Kras as the only possible gainer this week. Kras edged down 10 kuna to close at 420.</p>
<p>In a slow market on Tuesday with only eight issues traded, four were up, three were down and one remained flat.</p>
<p>Volume was down to 1,649 shares from 2,393 last Friday, while turnover was up at 2.2 million kuna from 1.4 million.</p>
<p>The biggest gainer was drug firm Pliva which gained 995 kuna to close at 13,000 on volume of 106 shares.</p>
<p>Istrian hotelier Laguna Porec gained 25 kuna to close at 1,050 on volume of 100 shares. Of other tourist firms Jadranturist gained 10 to 220, while Istraturist lost 10 to close at 125.</p>
<p>The biggest loser was cable producer Elka which lost 25 kuna to close at 195 on only 19 shares.</p>
<p>Also on the losing side was the most actively traded Zagrebacka Banka which edged down 10 kuna to 980 with 550 shares traded.</p>
<p>($1=5.5635 kuna)</p>
