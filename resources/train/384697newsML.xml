<p>Hong Kong could rezone some surplus industrial land for residential use, the government's director of planning, Peter Pun, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Pun said determining how much could be rezoned required consideration of factors including the infrastructure, traffic, environment, and ownership situation of each site.</p>
<p>&quot;So up to this point in time, we cannot tell you exactly where and when and how much land can be rezoned from industrial to residential,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Pun said Hong Kong had 560 hectares of existing and planned industrial land for general industrial uses, half of which had been developed, but said government-commissioned consultants had forecast the need for industrial land would fall to 260 hectares by 2001 and 250 hectares by 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;On the face of it, we will have a surplus of 300 hectares of land for general industrial uses,&quot; Pun said.</p>
<p>But the surplus would be between 115 and 140 hectares after taking into account additional land required for new industrial developments which will be more land-intensive and to meet new planning standards, and general industrial land being considered for conversion to special industrial use, he added.</p>
<p>Moreover, consultants had forecast a deficit of 185 hectares by 2011 of land for special industrial uses, relating to purpose-designed, owner-occupied premises needed for emerging high-value-added and high-technology industries, Pun said.</p>
<p>&quot;In this respect, the government is actively planning the fourth industrial estate and a science park. We are also looking into the concept of a business estate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pun said consultants had recommended that a sufficient stock of industrial land be maintained to facilitate Hong Kong's long-term development.</p>
<p>Despite Hong Kong's transition to a service-oriented economy, PUn said the manufacturing industry employed 18 percent of the workforce in 1995 and accounted for 9.2 percent of the gross domestic product.</p>
