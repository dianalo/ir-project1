<p>Ejected from their homes in the waning days of the Iran-Iraq war, Mohammed Hassan Kadir and his fellow villagers made their way back in 1991, three years after the last rounds were fired in anger.</p>
<p>But his fields were sown with anti-tank mines and his own house was booby-trapped. When Kadir tried to rebuild, a hidden charge tore his right leg off at the knee and killed five village children.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still mines here, there. They are everywhere,&quot; Kadir said, his hand describing an arc across the lush fields and small homes that make up the village of Dashtetele.</p>
<p>Nine years after one of the bloodiest land wars in modern history, Kurdish villagers are still taking daily casualties.</p>
<p>Experts say as many as 20 million land mines -- mostly anti-personnel devices designed to do maximum damage to human tissue -- dot the forbidding hills along the border marches.</p>
<p>Many were sown by Iranian forces as they moved through the hills in the early years of the war. Others were laid on top by counter-attacking Iraqi troops.</p>
<p>Villages like Dashtetele, just over the Iranian border, changed hands several times throughout the war. The result is a hodge-podge of mines, with none of the &quot;clean&quot; lines of a classic battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the minefields that we are dealing with now are more than a decade old. Consequently they have been disrupted by weather, by people,&quot; said John Humphreys, Iraq programme director for the British-based charity Mines Advisory Group.</p>
<p>&quot;Their exact dimensions and location are rarely known. There are no maps of these minefields. Many of them are located close to inhabited areas,&quot; Humphreys told Reuters.</p>
<p>SPRAYS WHITE-HOT FRAGMENTS</p>
<p>The mines of Iraq come in all shapes and sizes, from the almost undetectable Chinese-made 72a to the Valmara 69 -- an Italian killer that leaps in the air before spraying white-hot fragments in a lethal zone 30 metres (yards) in all directions.</p>
<p>The Mines Advisory Group, widely known as MAG, is on the front lines of what has shaped up as the final battle of the 1980-1988 war between the two regional superpowers.</p>
<p>Local teams, under the eyes of former British army experts, locate, clear and destroy the mines that infest the region. Others survey and mark minefields or educate the villagers, especially children, of the dangers that lurk all around.</p>
<p>But their work, already daunting and potentially deadly, is now more difficult than ever.</p>
<p>More than a year ago neighbouring Turkey, gateway to Iraq's largely Kurdish north, cut off the supply of new mine detectors and protective clothing. It fears the gear will fall into the hands of its own rebel Kurds, who maintain bases inside Iraq.</p>
<p>Recently, Ankara has refused to allow foreign aid workers to cross back into Iraq to carry on their work, forcing the expatriate experts of MAG and other organisations to explore informal routes through Syria or even Iran.</p>
<p>Foreign donors, alarmed by the recent upturn in factional fighting among the Kurds, are increasingly sceptical of the aid effort, set in motion after a U.S.-led air force carved out a Kurdish &quot;safe haven&quot; from central Iraqi control in 1991.</p>
<p>SHORT OF MONEY</p>
<p>MAG's own funds run out at the end 1996, and it may have to furlough staff unless new money arrives soon.</p>
<p>With access restricted, funding uncertain and many of its aging Austrian-made detectors no longer 100 percent reliable, MAG has had to move away from mine clearance and toward simply marking out the deadly fields.</p>
<p>&quot;We could triple our clearing capacity if Turkey just let through enough detectors,&quot; said one frustrated British expert as his teams coaxed the mines from the hills surrounding Mohammed Kadir's house.</p>
<p>Like his colleagues, he requested anonymity for fear of reprisal by agents of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who has declared such aid &quot;illegal&quot; in the rebel north.</p>
<p>MAG figures show more than 2,200 people have been killed in northern Iraq by leftover landmines since 1991 and 4,000 injured. Many others die unnoticed -- and uncounted -- in remote villages.</p>
<p>In a society tied to the land, almost everyone is at risk: farmers planting crops, shepherds tending their flocks and women gathering firewood or wild berries.</p>
<p>An hour's drive over the mountains from Dashtetele, in the hospital wards of Sulaimaniya, the carnage is on full display.</p>
<p>&quot;We get an average of one mine victim a day,&quot; said Ake Hyden, who helps run the Emergency Hospital for War Victims.</p>
<p>&quot;And now that it's the season for collecting wood for the winter we have a lot of women. Otherwise we see mostly men.&quot;</p>
<p>HORSE DETONATES MINE</p>
<p>Farmer Salih Abdullah said his horse stepped on a mine, sending fragments, dirt and rocks tearing through his face and upper body. The animal was killed on the spot, but doctors remain hopeful they can save Abdullah's eyesight.</p>
<p>Across the hall, a young man said he lost his foot while smuggling flour from Iran to feed his family. He faces months of waiting for an artificial limb.</p>
<p>To minimise the danger to their teams, MAG works to exacting military procedures. A spotter backs up each man in the field and the two rotate jobs every 30 minutes to stay alert.</p>
<p>Since 1992, MAG has cleared more than 35,000 mines and destroyed hundreds of tonnes of unexploded ordnance.</p>
<p>But with millions of mine still in the ground, the men and women of MAG say they prefer not to think in such absolute terms.</p>
<p>&quot;Every mine that you lift is potentially a life or a limb saved,&quot; said MAG director Humphreys.</p>
<p>&quot;Every minefield you demarcate is countless numbers of people who are safe from injury and possibly death.&quot;</p>
