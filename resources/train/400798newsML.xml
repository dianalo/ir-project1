<p>Russia's government, battling social problems and a deep economic slump, will be reshuffled and some ministers may lose their jobs next month, Interfax news agency quoted a cabinet spokesman as saying on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Igor Shabdurasulov said the first changes could be announced on March 6 during a government session that plans to review last year's economic and social policy and the perspectives for 1997.</p>
<p>That session will follow President Boris Yeltsin's planned annual address to both houses of parliament.</p>
<p>On Monday Yeltsin told Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in remarks broadcast on television that some of his ministers may have to go to help quell rising social strife and make the government more efficient.</p>
<p>Shabdurasulov said Chernomyrdin had given instructions to prepare for &quot;the structural reorganisation of the government&quot;, adding that changes had been planned even before Yeltsin made his criticisms.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, made clear on Monday that the president's anger was not aimed against Chernomyrdin personally. &quot;There has been no word about sacking the prime minister,&quot; Interfax quoted Yastrzhembsky as saying.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, keen to show he is back in control after recovering from pneumonia and open heart surgery, said he was unhappy with an opinion poll that showed most Russians did not believe the president and government could tackle the country's problems.</p>
<p>The non-payment of wages and pensions is one major reason for the government's unpopularity and has sparked strikes and labour protests across the vast country.</p>
<p>Locked in a web of debt, many firms say they cannot pay their workers because their suppliers do not pay them on time. The government blames tax dodgers for its cash shortages.</p>
