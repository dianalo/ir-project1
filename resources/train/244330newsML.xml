<p>The Israeli government convened on Monday to decide on further budget cuts which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said were needed to put the economy back on track and attract foreign investment.</p>
<p>Treasury sources put the additional cuts at some 1.8 billion shekels ($486 million), on top of the 4.9 billion shekels of cutbacks included in the original 1997 budget of 190.8 billion shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;We are presenting another cut because it became clear to us that revenues have not met our expectations,&quot; Finance Minister Dan Meridor said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, the world is watching us -- investors, banks and governments -- to see...whether the government will fix what has gone wrong in the economy in the last two years,&quot; he told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Economists said government revenues have fallen below projections and the prospect of increased government borrowing has pushed up interest rates, strengthened the shekel and sucked in imports. As a result Israel's current account deficit is expected to widen to more than $5 billion this year from $4.1 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister opened the meeting and explained the need to cut the budget. He said it would have been easy to expand the overdraft of the previous government...and everyone would have been happy,&quot; Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the national debt would have grown and it would have hit the weaker sectors of the public first. Instead, he is taking the correct and courageous step to get the economy on the right growth track,&quot; Bazak told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Legislators have said the reductions, widely reported to target spending on social welfare and education, would hit lower-income Israelis hardest.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, a champion of the underprivileged and a key coalition partner, has declined to say if he would support the cuts.</p>
<p>Other than pledging not to raise taxes for now, the Treasury has not publicly given precise details of the new budget package, pending the cabinet debate.</p>
<p>&quot;The cut will be very deep. I don't think there has been a cut like this one in the last 10 years,&quot; Netanyahu's economic adviser Moshe Leon said as the cabinet met.</p>
<p>&quot;In education there is still fat that can be cut and that's what we are talking about,&quot; Leon said. &quot;If cuts are carried out as the Treasury proposes, harm shouldn't be done to the weaker sectors.&quot;</p>
<p>On the eve of the cabinet session, Netanyahu took the unprecedented step of appearing with Meridor in a carefully- orchestrated prime-time television appeal for support for the cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;Successful implementation will lead to large investments in Israel,&quot; Netanyahu said on television.</p>
<p>But Treasury sources said the proposals included the already-announced sale of government-owned homes in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, a move certain to draw Arab and international ire. Some 3,000 homes will be sold.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has also said Israel would have to increase its defence budget even as it tried to reduce government spending. Tensions with the Arab world, especially Syria, have risen since the right-wing leader took office in June.</p>
<p>His spokesman said the cabinet was due to vote on the proposals later on Monday, after which the package will go to parliament for debate and a ratification vote before December 31.</p>
