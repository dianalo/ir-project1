<p>The dollar fell against the German mark, Japanese yen and other major currencies Monday as traders locked in profits ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's semiannual testimony to Congress.</p>
<p>Weighing on the dollar were worries about a delay in Europe's plans for a single currency, which helped the mark, and fears that Japanese companies might sell large amounts of dollars before the end of Japan's fiscal year.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.6745 marks late in New York from 1.6893 marks late on Friday. It settled at 122.23 yen, below Friday's close of 123.25.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a round of profit-taking,&quot; said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange at ING Barings Capital Markets. He said there were &quot;increased concerns&quot; about Europe's single currency and that there has been &quot;talk about Japanese repatriation, allthough it's hard to say at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>The Japanese company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said it planned to liquidate all its dollar-denominated deposits, currently about $700 million, and covert them into yen to make up shortfalls in cash.</p>
<p>This sparked concern that other Japanese companies might repatriate funds, as they have in prior years ahead of the end of Japan's fiscal year in March, and boosted the yen.</p>
<p>The dollar's poor performance against the mark was a function of fresh doubts about the timetable for Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>A survey in the German magazine Der Spiegel showed over the weekend that 77 percent of Germans want economic and monetary union delayed from its planned start date of 1999.</p>
<p>Because the mark would probably be replaced by a weaker single European currency, the German currency tends to gain when doubts about Europe's single currency plans surface.</p>
<p>Traders said Fed Chairman Greenspan's upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins testimony provided yet another reason to take profits in the dollar Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of concern about Humphrey-Hawkins,&quot; said Bob Near, vice president on the corporate foreign exchange desk at Bank of New York. &quot;There's a chance, given Greenspan's 'irrational exuberance' concerns of the past, that he could send the markets for a loop.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan, who will present his assessment of the U.S. economy to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday and the House Banking Committee on March 5, sent global markets reeling last December when he spoke of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in U.S. markets.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.4580 Swiss francs from 1.4715 on Friday and to Canadian $1.3620 from C$1.3644.</p>
<p>The British pound rose to $1.63558 vs. $1.6185.</p>
