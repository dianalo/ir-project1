<p>Food and drinks group Allied Domecq Plc said on Tuesday it expected underlying group profits in the half year to February 28 1997 to be marginally ahead before the impact of sterling's appreciation.</p>
<p>Chairman Sir Christopher Hogg told the group's annual meeting, &quot;If sterling maintains its current levels for the remainder of the year, the adverse impact on profits before tax arising from translation would be of the order of 20 milllion pounds for the year as a whole.&quot;  </p>
<p>Hogg said the group's trading and financial performance in the five months to January 31 1997 had been broadly in line with expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;We are therefore on course to meet our growth objectives for the year but the growth will be concentrated in the second half,&quot; he said in the statement.</p>
<p>Volumes in Allied's main brands of spirits and wine were level with last year. Allied held its prices during a competitive Christmas in the UK, with the result that price increases continued to lag the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>In Europe as a whole, Hogg said the trading environment remained difficult, particularly in France, Italy and Britain.</p>
<p>Ballantines whisky performed well in Spain and Germany and Beefeater gin boosted volume and market share in Spain. Trading conditions in the United States were stable, while Domecq Mexico was trading &quot;resiliently.&quot;</p>
<p>Hogg said the group was investing more in marketing its spirits brands and expenditure had been increased sharply in the United States for Beefeater and Sauza, while a new Kahlua campaign was being planned.</p>
<p>In retailing, pub profits would benefit from the release of the Carlsberg-Tetley uneconomic beer supply provision.</p>
<p>The group is rolling out its pub brands, such as Big Steak Pubs with Wacky Warehouses, Firkins and Mr Q's. The increased number of temporary closures resulting from the expansion would affect mainly the first half.</p>
<p>In franchising, both Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins were increasing store numbers and same store sales. Victoria Wine was hit by lower spirits sales, reflecting the UK market trend, with growth of cross border shopping a further negative influence on performance. Borrowings had fallen in the current year making the interest charge significantly lower.</p>
