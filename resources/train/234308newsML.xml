<p>Top TAMPA Airlines executives are looking forward to more business, especially with Asia as a result of the big investment by Martinair Holland NV, a top TAMPA executive told Reuters Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We compliment each other, we can both benefit,&quot; Eric Andrews, U.S. general manager for TAMPA, said. TAMPA has an extensive network in South America and Martinair in Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America.  </p>
<p>In early November, Dutch cargo and charter airline Martinair Holland bought a 40 percent stake in TAMPA Airlines (Transportes Aereos Mercantiles Panamericanos), an all-cargo, Colombian airline, for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>TAMPA's Colombian owners retain control, Andrews said. Martinair is owned by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV and Nedlloyd.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really quite a major thing for TAMPA,&quot; Robert Booth, an aviation consultant in Miami, said. &quot;It gives TAMPA some working capital.&quot;  </p>
<p>Top TAMPA and Martinair executives are meeting in Medellin this week to work out details and discuss possible cooperative efforts, Andrews said.</p>
<p>TAMPA carried the fifth most international cargo through Miami International Airport in the first nine months of 1996, hauling 72,901 tons, a decline of 12 percent over what it carried in the first nine months of 1995, according to statistics compiled by the Dade County Aviation Department. Martinair carried 2,865 tons of international cargo through Miami International Airport ranking it 62nd.  </p>
<p>TAMPA will be able to expand its reach with the tie to Martinair. They hope to cooperate by utilizing the Duth carriers' aircraft and are already wet-leasing one freighter.</p>
<p>&quot;They have the aircraft necessary for high-volume, long- distance routes,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>TAMPA fields only five older aircraft, two DC-8s and three 707s. And TAMPA is constrained due to both bilateral aviation agreements with the United States and because the Federal Aviation Administation has placed Colombia in safety classification two, which restricts Colombia's airlines.  </p>
<p>&quot;Asia is the next big thing,&quot; Andrews said. He projects trade between Asian and Latin America will grow sharply. Martinair already has an Asian network, he said, and the partnership is a good way for both partners to exploit the new market.</p>
<p>&quot;The Asian carriers are already coming into Miami. It is the first step to penetrate the Latin American market. Those that have positioned themselves first in the maket will get a good share of this growing market,&quot; Andrews said.</p>
