<p>South Africa, trying to forge a united army out of former foes, said on Tuesday it would send officers for training in Germany which recently created a united force out of former East and West German soldiers.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Joe Modise told a news conference he had accepted the proposal from his visiting German counterpart Volker Ruehe, whose aides said 10 officers would go initially for training, ranging from a few weeks to a year.</p>
<p>&quot;We will take full advantage of the offer that has been made,&quot; Modise said after talks with Ruehe in Cape Town.</p>
<p>One would go to a U.N. college for peacekeeping, an area where South Africa -- which offered troops for an aborted multinational force for Zaire last year -- is keen to learn.</p>
<p>Modise said South Africa could learn a lot from Germany, particularly its success in fusing a new force out of the old West and East German armies that had icily faced each other across the Iron Curtain before Germany reunited in 1990.</p>
<p>The South African National Defence Force is similarly trying to turn itself into a cohesive national force made up of members of the old apartheid army and their former enemies from the African National Congress's armed wing.</p>
<p>Modise said South Africa would wait for a full defence review, due to be completed in April, before deciding on a possible purchase of corvettes -- equivalent to European light frigates -- for its navy.</p>
<p>Ruehe, asked about Germany's reported interest in bidding to sell the ships to Pretoria's navy, said only that Bonn had an interest in &quot;technical cooperation&quot; with South Africa's defence ministry.</p>
<p>He is on a tour of Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p>
