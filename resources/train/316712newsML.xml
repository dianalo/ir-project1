<p>Nicola Horlick, the British fund manager whose fall from grace stunned the world of finance, harbours high hopes for the future even if her old firm insists it has offered nothing to the unemployed mother of five.</p>
<p>&quot;Justice will be done!&quot; was Horlick's rallying cry to her former colleagues on Friday, typical of the unrelenting dynamism that took her to the very top in a man's world.</p>
<p>The former head of pension fund business at London-based Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) was suspended this week pending an internal investigation into what the firm called &quot;a potential breach of her contract.&quot;</p>
<p>She resigned on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Friday, she flew to Germany to plead her case to MGAM's parent company, saying she still hankered after her old job and hoped the matter could be brought to a speedy conclusion.</p>
<p>The talks yielded no decision on her future.</p>
<p>&quot;I've given my side of the story  -- undoubtedly there is going to be another side of the story,&quot; she said late on Friday night after returning home from Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Horlick -- dubbed Superwoman by the British press for her ability to juggle family and career -- said she was &quot;heartened&quot; by what the bank had to say, even if the bank said it had offered no concessions.</p>
<p>&quot;They were extremely polite,&quot; she told reporters at London's Heathrow airport. &quot;For once in this whole affair I felt someone had behaved extremely well...It has restored my faith in human beings after everything I have been through.&quot;</p>
<p>As for her weekend plans following a tumultous week that saw her china-doll face catapulted onto the front pages, Superwoman said she simply planned to spend it with the kids.</p>
<p>And the future?</p>
<p>&quot;I would really like to do my old job but I can't judge what the feeling is,&quot; said Horlick.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said no concessions had been made at Friday's meetings in Germany and that the company had only listened to Horlick as a courtesy.</p>
<p>&quot;No concessions were made at all,&quot; said spokesman Markus Will. He said Horlick had been told that any matter relating to her former employment with MGAM had to be addressed to her former employers in London, not the parent company in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The dispute is believed to centre on allegations that 35-year-old Horlick tried to take some of her MGAM team with her in a move to Dutch Bank ABN AMRO.</p>
<p>Asked about the dispute, she said: &quot;ABN Amro have refuted that and I concur with that. I was never planning a team move.&quot;</p>
<p>But Horlick said she had been approached by plenty of other institutions since the furore and that she would seek an unspecified amount of compensation if she was not reinstated.</p>
<p>MGAM chief executive Robert Smith said: &quot;We are standing by our actions and we are completely satisfied that we have acted properly throughout.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not very pretty reading, of course, and no one enjoys reading about themselves the way we're being described, but I don't think it will do lasting damage,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
