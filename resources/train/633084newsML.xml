<p>Oil companies are hoarding petrol to avoid a feared increase in excise duty in Britain's new Labour government's first budget which has been set for July 2, dealers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They may save some $65 for every tonne of gasoline which passes through customs ahead of a duty increase which oil traders have speculated may be around three pence per litre.</p>
<p>Pre-budget buying has helped boost the price of June delivery gasoline on the European spot market to around eight dollars per tonne over July prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget has had a big influence on June gasoline,&quot; a trader said. &quot;It has happened before, with the other budgets.&quot;</p>
<p>The previous Conservative government pledged to increase excise duty by five percent per year above the level of inflation and Labour has not said it will reverse that.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no specific commitment either way in the manifesto and the chancellor is free to do what he wants in the budget,&quot; a source at the U.K. Treasury said, but declined to be drawn further.</p>
<p>If there is a three-pence duty increase, even a small 5,000 tonne cargo of gasoline which passes customs in time would save its owner some $325,000.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing in their manifesto to say it will happen but once budget date has been fixed, and if you have spare storage space, it is not a bad idea to pop another cargo in your tanks in case,&quot; said Peter Regnier of independent analysts Oil Price Assessments Ltd (OPAL).</p>
<p>&quot;The savings are astounding.&quot;</p>
<p>There are signs that the Labour government will be every bit as eager to curb private motoring.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, in an interview with the Guardian newspaper last month, did not mention any petrol tax changes but said &quot;We want to improve public transport and make it more attractive so that people will use their cars less.&quot;</p>
<p>Some 75 percent of the price U.K. motorists currently pay at the pump is tax - made up of excise duty, currently at 36.86 pence per litre, plus 17.5 percent Value Added Tax slapped on that total.</p>
<p>Bulk cargoes of premium unleaded gasoline delivered to British ports are currently worth some $220 a tonne. Distribution costs are at around $100, excise duty is around $800, and 17.5 percent VAT on top of all that works out at around $200, Regnier said.</p>
<p>A rise in duty of three pence per litre, or around $65 a tonne, would work out at around five percent of that total - in line with the Conservatives' previous pledge.</p>
<p>Higher excise duty on petrol is attractive to governments because it comes into effect immediately - at 1700 gmt on budget day.</p>
<p>&quot;This makes it the most tempting tax,&quot; Regnier said, adding it would be popular as it would also be seen as environment-friendly.</p>
<p>But he said it was hard to calculate how much after-customs storage space was normally available because oil refiners and traders, for cash flow reasons, prefer to keep their main storage tanks on the other side of customs barriers. Duty-paid gasoline tends to be stored in more numerous and smaller inland tanks, as well as in petrol stations themselves.</p>
<p>But the savings on the extra duty-paid gasoline squeezed in ahead of the budget are not all going to be passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>After previous budgets some petrol retailers have keep prices low in an effort to increase market share. But many others prefer to put up pump prices immediately and pocket the difference.</p>
