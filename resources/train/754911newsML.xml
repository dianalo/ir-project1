<p>The government-owned Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) said on Thursday it expected a better result for the year to June 30 1997 because of higher landing charges.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be better because of the increased landing charges that we had during the year,&quot; FAC chief executive officer Barry Murphy told reporters after a speech at a business luncheon.</p>
<p>FAC reported a 14.5 percent rise in net profit of A$78.1 million in 1995/96 and a 14.6 percent rise in sales to A$579.3 million.  </p>
<p>The 1996/97 result would be the last under FAC's former structure as the sole owner of Australia's main 22 airports.</p>
<p>The Australian government raised A$3.34 billion from the sale of long-term leases to Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports, which were all formerly owned by the FAC.</p>
<p>The airports privatisaiton was announced in May, but was formally completed in early July. The government is now conducting phase two of its airports privatisation programme with the proposed sale of 15 FAC owned airports.</p>
<p>This is expected to be completed mid-1988.</p>
