<title>AUSTRALIA: Former Australian retail boss jailed for four years.</title>

<p>The former chief of Australian retail giant Coles Myer Ltd was sentenced on Wednesday to four years in jail for defrauding the company of A$4.46 million.</p>
<p>Brian Quinn, convicted last month of fraudulently using the money to make lavish refurbishments to his Melbourne mansion, will not be eligible for parole until he has served 30 months of his sentence, judge Geoff Eames told the Victorian Supreme Court.  </p>
<p>Announcing the sentence, Eames described the case as one of greed, vanity and extravagance and said that Quinn, 60, had shown no remorse in defrauding the company he ran for almost six years.</p>
<p>Quinn, dressed smartly in a grey suit and burgundy tie, was grim-faced as the sentence was imposed. He has been held in custody since being found guilty of fraud on April 19 and was was immediately escorted back to prison after the sentence.  </p>
<p>Quinn had denied that between 1982 and 1988 he and a more junior Coles manager had conspired to falsely claim the money spent on renovating Quinn's home as work done on Coles properties.</p>
<p>Work on the house included adding another storey, building a tennis court and building an eight-car garage. Interior work included installation of a mirror worth A$15,000.</p>
<p>&quot;It was extravagance and excess to such a degree to be demonstrative of the fact that you did not intend to pay for the work yourself,&quot; Eames told Quinn.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible to escape the conclusion that what occurred here was motivated by greed,&quot; Eames said.</p>
<p>After the April 19 verdict a string of prominent Australians including Victorian state premier Jeff Kennett gave character testimony to the court.</p>
<p>Eames acknowledged Quinn's reputation as one of the country's most successful businessmen but said Quinn had clearly believed his talents warranted more in the way of reward than his handsome salary packages.  </p>
<p>&quot;The company was not ungenerous. It was the height of vanity to believe that your talents had not been sufficiently rewarded,&quot; the judge said.</p>
<p>&quot;It remains a criminal offence to plunder the assets of a company, whatever the opinion held by the thief of his own worth to the company.&quot;</p>
