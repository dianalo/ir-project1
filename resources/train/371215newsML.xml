<title>UK: Dollar firms despite G7, Eurobourses mixed.</title>
<headline>Dollar firms despite G7, Eurobourses mixed.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-11</dateline>

<p>By  Peter Griffiths</p>
<p>The dollar headed higher against the mark in European trading on Tuesday and appeared to have finally shrugged off weekend signals from the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations that it had risen far enough.</p>
<p>On the bourses, leading European shares were mixed with some being marked down in a predictable reaction to a 49 point overnight slide on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Stock market sentiment was in marked contrast to Monday trading, which saw no fewer than eight European bourses hit new inter-day highs.</p>
<p>Currency traders said the dollar's climb was supported by continuing worries about the German economy. The dollar was also firm against the yen, but fears of possible intervention by the Bank of Japan to curb its rise were having a damping effect.</p>
<p>Last weekend a statement from G7 finance chiefs said currency &quot;misalignments&quot; had now been corrected, but it shunned talk of intervention to hold the dollar down.</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese officials will continue to talk a stable yen, but I think the dollar will remain pretty well underpinned near term,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International.,</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6670 marks at 1015 GMT, up from late Monday's European level of 1.6571. Dollar/yen rose to 123.20 from 122.83.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's concluding, and I think rightly so, that G7 was not an absolute, definitive watershed,&quot; said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>
<p>&quot;So long as the G7 is not going to change its monetary policy, the dollar is likely to push higher.&quot;</p>
<p>The London stock market, Europe's busiest, was trading mixed by mid-morning having opened slightly lower. Dealers believed, however, the blue chip FTSE's decline would be shortlived.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not seeing a lot of selling. Market makers will cut prices until the buyers return,&quot; one senior dealer said. &quot;If Wall Street has a good start later today we could end the day a bit better.&quot;</p>
<p>The FTSE 100, which on Monday finished just 0.1 point below its record close of 4,307.8 set last Friday, was down 2.4 points at 4,305.3 by 1045 GMT.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt the strength of the dollar -- which is good for German exports -- outweighed the negative effect of the fall on Wall Street. The DAX index of leading shares was trading a third of a percentage point higher by mid-morning.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading volumes would be limited however because Tuesday was a half-day pre-Lent holiday in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>	 In Paris French stocks managed to open higher but quickly</p>
<p>fell into negative territory, under pressure from Wall Street's drop and strong resistance at the 2,600 level.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down half a percent at 1015 GMT. Despite the losses, traders said the French market was underpinned to some degree by firmness in bond prices and in the dollar.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1015 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6670 marks and 123.20 yen compared with 1.6571 marks and 122.83 yen in late European trading on Monday</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1015  GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was down 2.4  at  4,305.3.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 was down 12.33 at 2,582.67.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index was up 8.73 at 3,193.09.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $338.85, its lowest level since April 22, 1993 and against $340.40 previously. Silver, taking a back seat to gold, was off a cent at $4.94.</p>
