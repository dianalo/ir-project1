<p>Swedish/U.S. drugs group Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn said on Thursday that a market consensus forecast for earnings per share of $2.35 for 1997 was about $0.10 too high.  </p>
<p>P&amp;U spokesman Jan Isoz said that the company's finance director Bob Salisbury had told analysts at a telephone conference that the consensus forecast on the market was slightly too high.</p>
<p>&quot;The average forecast is around $2.35, and he (Bob Salisbury) said that it could be around 10 cents too high,&quot; Isoz told Reuters.</p>
<p>Isoz said that adverse currency effects would mean that 1996 would be a worse year than previously expected.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't get as far in 1996 as we thought as far as EPS is concerned. That means you also have to downgrade 1997 (forecasts),&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He pointed out that P&amp;U did not expect its sales to grow faster than the market average until 1998.</p>
<p>The company's comments at the telephone conference led to a sharp drop in the share price. The share fell to 230 crowns at 1425 GMT from 249 crowns 25 minutes earlier.</p>
