<p>Taiwan said on Thursday it would open its door wider to businessmen from China despite Taipei's official attempts to cool local firms' fever to invest in the mainland.</p>
<p>The economics ministry issued a statement saying it had decided to ease rules to allow visits by China businessmen.</p>
<p>Current rules allow senior executives and technical staff from mainland companies to apply to visit Taiwan for business purposes for a month, with the option to extend the visit for a second month.</p>
<p>The relaxed rule will allow middle-level executives and technical staff to visit for business functions or training.</p>
<p>They will be eligible to stay in Taiwan for one month to visit or attend meetings, or for three months for training. Extensions under these terms are not allowed.</p>
<p>The move is expected to expand economic and trade exchanges across the Taiwan strait, the statement said.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned all direct official contact with China since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the Nationalists fled to the island.</p>
<p>Despite the ban, indirect commerce has flourished since the late 1980s, when political tensions began to thaw. About 30,000 Taiwan companies have poured more than US$20 billion into China so far.</p>
<p>Last week, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui accused China of using commerce as a political lever against the island and Taiwan's top economic policymaker told local businessmen it was time to slow their investment projects in the mainland.</p>
<p>&quot;Communist China is trying to use our people to coerce our government and use commerce to achieve political coercion, in order to pressure our government,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;Faced with this situation, we must uphold the principle of exercising restraint and avoiding rashness in order to handle the current cross-straits relations,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Though all investments in China must be government approved and routed indirectly through Hong Kong or other countries, Taiwan remains concerned that its economy may become too dependent on China -- and hence politically vulnerable.</p>
<p>President Lee said in August the island needed to review its policy of targeting China as its main market to avoid over-dependence on the mainland for investment.</p>
<p>Taiwan's President Enterprises said on September 12 it had abandoned plans to build a US$100 million power plant in China. It said it would instead invest more than T$30 billion (US$1.1 billion) in local projects over two years.</p>
<p>On August 16, Formosa Plastics Group said it was ending a deal to build what would have been the biggest Taiwanese project in China to date, a US$3 billion power plant in coastal Fujian province.</p>
