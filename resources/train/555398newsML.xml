<title>CANADA: CanWest opposes Australian Ten ruling.</title>
<headline>CanWest opposes Australian Ten ruling.</headline>
<dateline>WINNIPEG 1997-05-02</dateline>

<p>CanWest Global Communications Corp said on Friday it disagreed with the ruling reached earlier today by the Australian government regarding CanWest's stake in Australia's Ten Group television network and would seek clarification of the ruling.</p>
<p>&quot;CanWest does not agree with FIRB (Foreign Investment Review Board)'s findings and the Treasurer's orders, and as financier to the forced sellers CanWest will seek further amplification and clarification from the Treasurer, while considering its options,&quot; CanWest Chief Executive Israel Asper said in a statement.  </p>
<p>He dismissed rumors that CanWest would be forced to sell down its 57.5 percent interest in Australia's Ten Group television network after a decision by Australian Treasurer Peter Costello.</p>
<p>Asper said Costello ruled earlier today that CanWest must sell its current 76 percent economic interest down to the previously sanctioned 57.5 percent, but not below that.</p>
<p>&quot;The essence of the Treasurer's orders is that CanWest's position in (Ten), namely its 57.5 percent economic interest, is to be restored to that which it had previous to the recent share purchases and financing transactions,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He said Costello's decision &quot;puts to rest the rumors that CanWest might be required to sell down its 57.5 percent economic interest in Network Ten.&quot;</p>
<p>The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) had said it might not be satisfied if CanWest reduced its stake in Ten to 57.5 percent because the level might still breach foreign ownership restrictions in the Broadcasting Services Act.</p>
<p>The ABA previously approved the 57.5 percent ownership level, since the equity was deemed to have voting rights attached of less than 15 percent -- the threshold set out for a foreign company in the act.  </p>
<p>Asper said Costello and the FIRB acted responsibly to clarify the government's intentions and remove &quot;the cloud of uncertainty caused by these baseless rumours,&quot; but he maintained CanWest's opposition to the decision.</p>
<p>Costello issued orders to the Australian companies, which acquired about 37 percent of Ten, requiring the sale of the Network Ten shares to persons unconnected with CanWest.</p>
<p>The divestitures are to be completed by September 30, 1997.</p>
<p>CanWest said Selli Pty Ltd and Donholken Pty Ltd, the Australian companies ordered to sell the shares, disputed the findings and might appeal the orders.</p>
<p>CanWest said Canadian government conveyed its concern to the Australian government that a Canadian company be treated fairly and not be subjected to retroactive rule changes from those under which it made its original investment.</p>
<p>&quot;The Canadian High Commissioner to Australia and several Canadian cabinet ministers have communicated these concerns to their Australian counterparts in order to avoid an issue arising under trade arrangements between the two countries,&quot; Asper said.</p>
