<p>The Federal Reserve Board, in an effort to trim its payroll, is offering employees eligible for retirement an incentive to leave their jobs at the central bank, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Fed Board employs about 1,700 people in Washington. The offer does not apply to employees at the Fed's regional banks.</p>
<p>&quot;They're just trying ... to see if they can cut down a little bit on the number of people,&quot; said one official, who declined to be named. &quot;Over the long run, I think they figure it will save money,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Employees who are eligible for retirement -- those whose age and length of service at the bank add up to 75 years or more -- will receive an extra six months of pay if they elect to leave the bank under the plan.</p>
<p>The offer will be open from June 1 through Aug. 29. Employees who take it must leave the bank by May 31, 1998.</p>
<p>Some of the Fed's most senior employees, including long-time spokesman Joseph Coyne, would be eligible for the plan.</p>
<p>Some of the employees who take up the offer would likely be replaced, while others would not. Depending on who left, the departures might also lead to some restructuring of operations at the Fed board, one official speculated.</p>
