<p>Cuba accused Spain's new conservative government of &quot;flagrant interference&quot; in its political affairs on Tuesday and withdrew its acceptance of a new Spanish ambassador.</p>
<p>The diplomatic crisis erupted after repeated criticism of Cuba's communist system by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who has called for democratic reforms on the Caribbean island.</p>
<p>Angered by Spanish moves to urge European Union partners to take a tougher stance against Cuba in line with U.S. policy, Havana revoked its earlier approval for Ambassador Jose Coderch, who was due to arrive in Havana in December.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and his deputy Isabel Allende met with EU ambassadors -- except Spain's outgoing envoy Eudaldo Mirapeix, to whom the ministry had earlier communicated its decision -- to explain the move.</p>
<p>Allende later told reporters Cuba still wanted to maintain relations with Spain. But she stressed that in Havana's view Madrid should adhere to principles of &quot;mutual respect and non-interference&quot; in its dealings with Havana.</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement in the Communist Party newspaper Granma, the Cuban Foreign Ministry listed a series of statements and actions by the Spanish government that it considered unacceptable &quot;provocations and interference.&quot;</p>
<p>The Spanish government blamed Cuba for the diplomatic crisis, saying Havana did not want to start democratic reforms. It said Cuba made a blunder withdrawing formal acceptance granted last month to its new ambassador.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a big mistake, in a word,&quot; Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes told state radio. &quot;It looks more like an unjustified tantrum than a serious, responsible reflection on the blockade Cuba is under.&quot;</p>
<p>But Allende said Cuba had been as patient as possible and objected to the public nature of Spanish policy. &quot;Diplomacy is not conducted publicly, diplomacy has its rules,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Dozens of police were posted around the Spanish embassy in Havana on Tuesday evening to keep order after several hundred curious Cubans congregated following news of the diplomatic spat.</p>
<p>Early in the evening several dozen people tried to break through the police barrier. Reporters saw several people led away by police or security members, apparently detained.</p>
<p>By early evening the police had been reinforced and were also accompanied by dozens of members of plainclothes civil order groups. Diplomatic sources said Cuban authorities were ensuring there were no disturbances.</p>
<p>Relations between the two countries, which have strong historical, cultural and economic ties, are at their lowest point since 1990. President Fidel Castro blasted Aznar without naming him in a speech on Sunday, accusing him of taking money from what he described as a mafia of Cuban exiles in Miami.</p>
<p>The Cuban statement attacked Spain for seeking to get its European Union partners to put pressure on Cuba for change.</p>
<p>&quot;Declarations and actions of this type constitute without doubt at all a flagrant interference in the internal affairs of Cuba and contradict the spirit and letter of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Allende stressed Havana's problem was not with the EU. &quot;It is not a dispute with the European Union, it is a problem that has arisen with Spain.&quot; But her comments on non-interference carried the implicit warning that Havana may be hostile to any future demands from the EU for reform.</p>
<p>Washington has long maintained an economic embargo on Cuba to try to encourage democratic change and in recent months has tried to persuade EU members to press Havana for reforms.</p>
<p>The Cuban statement complained about comments by Coderch to a Spanish newspaper last month in which he said he intended to open the doors of Spain's embassy in Havana to dissidents.</p>
<p>It also objected to the setting up in Spain this month of a Cuban opposition group that included hardline Miami-based exile leader Jorge Mas Canosa, whom it called a &quot;leader of the counter-revolutionary mafia.&quot;</p>
<p>Havana's move caps months of growing tension since Aznar took office in May and broke with the friendly approach toward Castro espoused by his predecessor Felipe Gonzalez.</p>
<p>Envoys from the 15 EU states are due to discuss Spanish proposals in Brussels this week. Diplomats expect EU foreign ministers next month to endorse a paper urging Castro's government to move toward democracy and open a dialogue with the Roman Catholic church and other organizations.</p>
