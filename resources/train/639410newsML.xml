<title>CANADA: Tone improves on Quebec/Newfoundland hydro talks.</title>
<headline>Tone improves on Quebec/Newfoundland hydro talks.</headline>

<p>There has been a positive change in tone for talks between Quebec and Newfoundland on renegotiating the controversial Churchill Falls hydroelectric contract, a senior Quebec cabinet minister said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a change in tone between Quebec and Newfoundland,&quot; Natural Resources Minister Guy Chevrette told reporters.</p>
<p>Chevrette was commenting on discussions between Quebec and Newfoundland on the hydroelectric power contract between Hydro-Quebec and Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corp.</p>
<p>At issue is the long-term contract under which Labrador's Churchill Falls sells roughly 30 billion kilowatt hours of power each year to Hydro-Quebec at low rates, which the Quebec-owned utility then sells at a significant markup to domestic and U.S. customers.</p>
<p>Under the contract, which runs to 2041, the rates Hydro-Quebec pays for power from the 5,420 megawatt Churchill Falls facility decline over time and Newfoundland has said it would soon begin losing money on the deal.</p>
<p>Newfoundland has long demanded that Quebec renegotiate the contract for an more equitable split of the profits, but successive Quebec governments have refused to re-open the deal.</p>
<p>In January, however, both sides agreed to begin discussing the issue.</p>
<p>At the New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers conference in Newport, R.I. on Wednesday, Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin hinted that the talks were advancing.</p>
<p>Newfoundland is also mulling the development of a massive hydro-electric project on the Lower Churchill River, a plan that has been on the backburner for many years because the remote Atlantic province would need technological and financial partners to build it.</p>
<p>Newfoundland's natural partner for the 17 billion kilowatt hour Lower Churchill Falls project would be Hydro-Quebec. But the recent deregulation of the U.S. hydro-electric energy market and the opening of Hydro-Quebec's power grid to allow the trans-shipment of power from other producers allowed Newfoundland to seek other partners.</p>
<p>In Newport, Tobin indicated that Newfoundland was prepared to do that.</p>
<p>Quebec's Chevrette said Hydro-Quebec had the expertise to help develop the Lower Churchill, and he suggested that talks on that project could be linked to the existing power contract.</p>
<p>&quot;Could it be mutually advantageous to negotiate things relating to existing contracts in accordance with future implications? I leave to the experts the task of making an analysis and recommendations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A working group on the talks is expected to report to the Newfoundland and Quebec premiers by September.</p>
