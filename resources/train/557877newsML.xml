<title>FRANCE: Blair election outstrips French campaign in France.</title>
<headline>Blair election outstrips French campaign in France.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-02</dateline>

<p>Labour leader Tony Blair's crushing victory in Britain's general election knocked France's own election campaign out of the headlines - and in one case off the front page altogether - in French national newspapers on Friday.</p>
<p>The left-of-centre daily Liberation ran a full page profile colour photo of Blair as its cover page with the headline: &quot;The Labour wave.&quot;</p>
<p>The centre-right Le Figaro ran a six-column headline reading: &quot;Blair succeeds Major&quot; alongside a photo of a smiling Blair.</p>
<p>The British election was also the main fare on French television and radios with most major stations having sent teams or correspondents to cover the result, mostly from London but also from chosen points around the British isles.</p>
<p>The Blair photo occupying Liberation's front page was in its latest editions, which went to press once his victory was confirmed, because early editions of the newspaper were more cautious, headlining &quot;Europe awaits Britain.&quot;</p>
<p>Liberation's prime columnist, Jacques Amalric, wrotet: &quot;The wear and tear effect is deadly in politics. Leaders wear away while in office but so do ideologies.&quot;</p>
<p>Amalric wrote that John Major &quot;lost whatever credit he still had left by accusing Tony Blair of being a puppet of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl. After the Iron Lady (Margret Thatcher), he (Major) was the marshmallow man.&quot;</p>
<p>Le Figaro wrote that the &quot;real victor&quot; of the British election was Mrs Thatcher since her ideas &quot;had proved to be irreversible.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour doesn't even pretend today to want to correct the worst Tory excesses. Tony Blair has promised that all he wants to be is the champion of Thatcherism with a human face.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday night, Foreign Minister Herve de Charette hailed the Labour Party victory in Britain's general election as a blow for &quot;British Euro-scepticism&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;As chairman of the (centre-right) PPDF I note that after 18 years of government by the Conservatives, British voters have decided to change majority,&quot; De Charette said in a statement released only an hour after the first estimates of the election result were released.</p>
<p>&quot;As a European, I congratulate myself for an election which, as a whole, marks a step back for British Euro-scepticism.</p>
<p>&quot;As Foreign Minister, I am ready to pursue and develop Franco-British dialogue and cooperation with the new government.</p>
