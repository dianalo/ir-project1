<p>European envoy Franz Vranitzky urged Albanian politicians to compromise over crucial elections on Friday as he ended another mission to the Balkan state without winning their agreement.</p>
<p>Early elections were agreed in March to halt rioting and violence after thousands of Albanians lost their life-savings in the collapse of pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>But the polls were thrown into jeopardy as some parties accused President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party of tilting the rules in its favour.</p>
<p>Vranitzky late on Thursday seemed to have brokered a fresh deal to get the elections back on track but most political parties later said they were again considering boycotting the poll.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the reason that political dialogue in this country must continue,&quot; former Austrian chancellor Vranitzky, on his fifth mission to bring calm to the former Stalinist state, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Although much calmer, Albania still sees violence and shootings every day and the whole country is subject to a curfew from nine in the evening to five in the morning.</p>
<p>The Socialists, Albania's second-largest party, remain deeply distrustful of Berisha and his right-wing former ruling party.</p>
<p>They said a new election law, passed in the early hours of Friday after Vranitzky persuaded politicians to amend it, was not still not acceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;We are unhappy with the passage of this law,&quot; said Naim Dokle, chairman of the Socialist Party parliamentary group. &quot;Now we are trying to talk with other parties.&quot;</p>
<p>The Socialists are part of a nine-party national unity government that was installed to stem the unrest. They and others want more electoral seats allocated on a proportional basis, while the Democratic Party wants more majority voting.</p>
<p>The Socialists pulled out of the last elections in May 1996, which international observers said were flawed.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, a special envoy of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said he did not think the planned election date of June 29 should be postponed.</p>
<p>His spokeswoman said the OSCE still planned to prepare to monitor the elections, vital for them to be considered free and fair in international eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope they will come to some sort of solution very soon,&quot; the spokeswoman told journalists.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready for the monitoring and we just hope that all the political parties will be on board,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Vranitzky again warned that the international community was closely watching Albania.</p>
<p>&quot;Albanian politicians must be aware of the fact that the international community may reconsider its preparedness to offer assistance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Italy, leader of a multi-national military force to safeguard aid supplies to Albania, has said the troops may leave if the deal on early elections falls apart.</p>
