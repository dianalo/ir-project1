<p>Pakistani stocks that soared 25 percent in the past month are ripe for profit-taking because the market over-reacted to the election win by the pro-business Nawaz Sharif, a brokerage house said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the weak economic conditions, we believe that the market has over-reacted to a PML (Pakistan Muslim League) victory,&quot; says a post-election report by brokerage house BMA Capital Management.</p>
<p>The PML won a landslide in elections on February 3 and named Sharif its prime minister, succeeding his rival Benazir Bhutto.</p>
<p>The BMA said the market had discounted the optimisim of political change and it was time for investors to book profits in the current buying euphoria and maintain positions only in fundamentally strong scrips.</p>
<p>The Karachi 100-share index rose more than 300 points in pre- and post-election rallies in the past one month on hopes that the new government would bring political stability and tackle the country's thorny economic problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Although it is unlikely that the market will dip much below 1,500 points, it is also unlikely that the market will rally another 25 percent from this level given the present inflation and interest rate environment,&quot; the BMA report said.</p>
<p>It said Pakistan's economy suffered from major structural imbalances, including a high trade deficit, rising inflation, a low reserves position and inadequate revenues.</p>
<p>Pakistan's trade gap rose to a provisional $2.126 billion in the first seven months of fiscal 1996/97 (July-June) from $2.097 billion in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The Consumer price index rose 2.17 percent in January compared to December, representing a year-on-year increase of 13.4 percent, up from 11.41 percent in December and 8.93 percent in January 1996. The report said Sharif, whose top priority is revival of the economy, will find it difficult to offer any incentives or relief to the industrial sector.</p>
<p>The BMA said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had reluctantly agreed to the textile and stock exchange packages presented by the caretaker government.</p>
<p>&quot;The harsh conditions imposed by the IMF on the previous governments, would constrain the elected government in taking new economic measures at its will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The government is likely to start negotiations on Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in March, which will further reduce the leeway available to Nawaz Sharif in economic matters,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;In short, Sharif would have little leverage in dictating his own economic policies.&quot;</p>
<p>The report said that given the resource constraints, the new government would find it difficult to present an industrialist-friendly budget for fiscal 1997/98 (July/June).</p>
<p>The BMA said the new government was likely to adjust the rupee downward against the dollar in the near term as the U.S. currency had strengthened in the international market.</p>
