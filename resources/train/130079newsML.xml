<title>CANADA: GM, Canada union agree on outsourcing.</title>

<p>General Motors Corp. and the Canadian Auto Workers union, after saying they had resolved the thorny issue of outsourcing and were near a deal to end a two-week strike, were locked in talks Monday as the union said a midday news conference had been delayed for 3-1/2 hours.</p>
<p>CAW President Buzz Hargrove, asked earlier if a tentative contract agreement was likely in time to meet a self-imposed noon EDT deadline for a settlement, said:</p>
<p>&quot;I'd say that was a fair assessment. We have resolved the issue of outsourcing,&quot; he said during a break in contract talks that lasted all weekend. The issue of outsourcing, or the shifting of work to outside firms, has been a particularly difficult one in the talks.</p>
<p>But by midday, the two sides were still at the negotiating table, and union officials said a news conference, originally set for noon EDT 1600 GMT would be held at 3:30 p.m. EDT 1930 GMT.</p>
<p>The union also postponed a caucus meeting set for midday, making it plain that the deadline would not be met.</p>
<p>Hargrove said the 26,000 striking workers, who began to hit the picket lines on Oct. 2 in an escalating strike, could start returning to work as soon as Wednesday afternoon if a tentative deal were reached Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone can start returning to work by late Wednesday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said there was enough of an agreement on outsourcing for him to be confident of a deal, which meets the labour agreement pattern the union set at Chrysler Corp. earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is enough common ground for the CAW to say they have met the pattern and hopefully our needs as well,&quot; Low said.</p>
<p>Both sides cautioned that there were still sticking points that could derail the talks, such as overtime rules at the Oshawa, Ontario, complex of the world's largest carmaker.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest read I had was there was still a lot of work there at the Oshawa local,&quot; Low said.</p>
<p>Local union officials from Oshawa said the &quot;floodgates had opened&quot; on the outsourcing issue and a deal there was likely.</p>
<p>GM said it had idled 18,371 assembly and parts plant workers in the United States and Mexico because of the strike. The number was up 10,893 from Friday and included elimination of some shifts at four U.S. car assembly plants -- in Orion Township, Mich.; Fairfax, Kan., Wentzville, Mo., and Lansing Mich.</p>
<p>Also idled were 2,050 workers at GM's transmission plant in Warren, Mich., and more than 1,000 workers at other parts plants the state.</p>
<p>GM's stock was up 62.5 cents at $53.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
