<p>France's Socialist Party, staking out its position as the new left-wing government considers whether to sell a minority stake in France Telecom, said on Thursday the group should remain under state control.</p>
<p>&quot;We said during the (election) campaign we want a French telecommunications company which remains a public company because it is a public service,&quot; Francois Hollande, the interim Socialist party secretary, told France Inter radio.</p>
<p>The government did not discuss the issue of France Telecom in its first full meeting on Thursday chaired by Gaullist centre-right President Jacques Chirac, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>If the centre-right had won the legislative election, the sale of 30 to 35 percent of France Telecom, possibly the biggest French stock market operation, would have started today.</p>
<p>&quot;On specific dossiers it is a question for the ministers in charge,&quot; government spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann said after the cabinet meeting. &quot;The prime minister's intention is not to be rushed into anything,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The issue of the sale of shares in France Telecom lies in the hands of Finance, Economy and Industry Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.</p>
<p>A co-writer of the Socialist election manifesto, Strauss-Kahn -- called &quot;DSK&quot; by his entourage -- opposes full privatisation.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in the run-up to the election that he was in favour of interaction between the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>Known as a pragmatic man, financial analysts expect him to press for the sale of a minority stake in the telecoms operator following a planned audit of France's public finances.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports suggest that there might be a budget shortfall of 25 to 50 billion francs ($4.3 to $8.6 billion).</p>
<p>France cannot use the proceeds of a France Telecom sale to plug this hole to meet the criteria for European economic and monetary union (EMU). But it can use the proceeds to finance other projects.</p>
<p>Former Finance Minister Jean Arthuis, who planned to sell France Telecom shares to raise 30 to 50 billion francs, wanted to use the money to refinance troubled state-companies such as bank Credit Lyonnais, insurer GAN or consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia.</p>
<p>&quot;Strauss-Kahn will want to use the money but he cannot be seen as reneging on the election promises. I think they will tell people they have found a big hole in the budget and that if they don't sell some of France Telecom, they can't carry out some of their job-creation plans,&quot; said a telecommunications analyst who did not want to be named.</p>
<p>He expected a sale to take place from September.</p>
<p>At France Telecom there was no comment on Thursday on whether chairman Michel Bon would seek talks with Strauss-Kahn to discuss the sale of a stake.</p>
<p>Bon told staff on Tuesday that the sale had effectively been suspended until the government took a decision. He said this was a setback but not a catastrophe and urged the company's 164,000 workforce to focus on the challenge of full competition in 1998.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said during the campaign he wanted to consult France Telecom staff before making a decision.</p>
<p>The CGC white-collar staff union said on Wednesday the sale was unavoidable, while leaders of three labour unions -- the CFTC, Force Ouvriere and CFDT -- said on Tuesday they would give qualified backing to a partial privatisation.</p>
<p>The Communist-led CGT and ultra-left Sud, the two largest unions at France Telecom, remain opposed. ($ = 5.825 French Francs)</p>
