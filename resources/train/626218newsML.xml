<p>A young Sierra Leonean man pushed to the front of the evacuation queue and waved a piece of paper at the a U.S. marine helping people fleeing a coup in the West African state.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a son of the deposed president. I have to leave the country,&quot; he pleaded, handing the marine a dog-eared document. It showed his surname as Kabbah, the same as ousted President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.</p>
<p>&quot;There are hundreds of Kabbahs in the queue,&quot; shouted a Sierra Leonean watching the drama. &quot;Send him away.&quot;</p>
<p>Scores of Lebanese men and Asians at the end of the line shouted their approval. The marine handed back the faded paper and politely showed the young man the way to the back of the queue.</p>
<p>What started as the evacuation of American citizens to the U.S. navy ship Kearsarge offshore quickly turned into a rush to leave the steamy capital.</p>
<p>By 3.30 p.m. (1530 GMT), 15 C-46 Sea Knight helicopters running non-stop shuttles had ferried all 900 waiting evacuees, including more than 300 U.S.-passport holders, to the U.S. Navy helicopter carrier Kearsage lying 12 miles off the coast.</p>
<p>Earlier Marine Lieutenant-Colonel Tom Greenwood had to send for more marines and sailors from the Kearsarge to handle the surging numbers wanting to leave. About 200 marines and sailors backed by fast attack vehicles had already deployed around the suburban hotel when the first four helicopters landed by daybreak.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll try to make sure that everybody who has to go is taken to the ship,&quot; said Greenwood, whose Battalion Landing Team 1/2 had previously been in action in the Gulf War, Somalia and Haiti and was recently on standby off Congo.</p>
<p>(Corrects by changing attribution of quotation to Greenwood from Kearsarge).</p>
<p>Bands of low-ranking soldiers with guns pillaged the city and attacked private homes, looting and raping, after junior officers toppled Kabbah's government last Sunday.</p>
<p>A week after the coup, which has been internationally condemned, tension was rising to boiling point as Nigerian troops prepare to dislodge the coupmakers under a regional mandate.</p>
<p>Military sources said they expected the Nigerians, joined by Ghanaians and Guineans, to strike as soon as marines completed the evacuation of Westerners on Friday.</p>
<p>A senior West African officer told Reuters the United States had insisted no military action be taken before evacuations were completed.</p>
<p>With uncertainty mounting, the United Nations on Thursday night ordered its 40 or so remaining staff in Sierra Leone to leave and most had joined the U.S. airlift.</p>
<p>&quot;Th U.N. headquarters in New York issued Phase Order last night, meaning everyone leave,&quot; one U.N. staff said.</p>
<p>A U.N. chartered ship evacuated non-essential staff and dependents on Wednesday to Conakry, Guinea, and was returning to Freetown on Friday to ferry more people.</p>
<p>Germany ordered its embassy in Freetown to close on Friday and its staff relocated temporarily in Conakry, charge d'affaires Conrad Fischer told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is so unpredictable that it could be unsafe to stay. This morning we got instructions from Bonn to close the embassy with immediate effect as a precaution for embassy staff,&quot; said Fischer, who was heading for the U.S. ship with two other remaining embassy diplomats.</p>
