<headline>Euro vegetable oil close steady on short covering.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>European vegetable oil prices closed mostly higher on Friday supported by pre-weekend short covering and a firmer close in the Far East.</p>
<p>After a choppy session the Malaysian market finished mostly higher despite a lack of any fresh news.</p>
<p>Most crop reports which were due for release in the next few days have been delayed by the Chinese New Year and Moslem Eid al-Fitr holidays.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority's (PORLA) stock, output and export data for January scheduled for release on February 15 has been put back until February 22 while private forecaster Ivan Wong will now release his report next week instead of this morning.</p>
<p>Traders said the delay to these reports and the U.S. holiday on Monday will lead to a slow start to business next week.</p>
<p>&quot;It could be the middle of next week before things get going again, but even then you will find people who want to see the PORLA data before making fresh commitments,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>During the European afternoon crude palm oil attracted some covering with Feb trading at $590 and $592.50, Mar at $587.50 and $585, Apr/Jun at $575 and Oct/Dec at $560 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Closing crude palm oil sellers were unchanged to $5 up.</p>
<p>No further business was reported among products which closed with RBD palm oil $2.50 to $2.50 down and olein $2.50 higher to unchanged.</p>
<p>Coconut oil also saw a certain amount of covering with Jan/Feb trading at $790, Feb/Mar at $780 and $782.50 and Mar/Apr at $770 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Closing sellers were $7.50 to $5 higher while palmkernel oil was $2.50 up and tradeless.</p>
<p>In soft oils soy oil finished 0.25 to 0.50 guilders higher after Feb/Apr traded at 98.50 guilders in a switch with May/Jun at 100 guilders.</p>
<p>Rape oil finished 0.50 guilders down to unchanged after Aug/Oct traded at 101 guilders a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Traders said there was no follow-through business in EU sunflower oil from Thursday and closing sellers were $7.50 to $5 up ex-tank.</p>
