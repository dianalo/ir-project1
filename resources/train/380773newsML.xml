<title>EGYPT: Syrian officials in Cairo for Mubarak talks.</title>
<headline>Syrian officials in Cairo for Mubarak talks.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1997-02-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Syrian Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara arrived in Cairo on Saturday and met President Hosni Mubarak for talks expected to cover latest developments in the Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>The Syrian officials, whose last visit to Cairo was less than a month ago, are carrying a message to Mubarak from President Hafez al-Assad, Syrian officials said.</p>
<p>The visit coincides with one to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on how to revive Syrian-Israeli peace talks.</p>
<p>Syria has condemned Netanyahu for refusing to trade occupied Arab land for peace and has launched an Arab campaign to put pressure on the current Israeli government to change its attitude towards peace with Arabs.</p>
<p>Khaddam and Shara have toured many Arab states during the last two weeks to rally support for Damascus's conditions for resuming talks with Israel.</p>
<p>Syria says the previous Israeli government had agreed to withdraw from the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, in return for peace with Damascus.</p>
<p>In Washington on Friday, Netanyahu said: &quot;Obviously we will take note of what took place in the talks between Syrian negotiators and the previous (Israeli) government.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;We cannot be bound by conversations or by ideas or by speculations and suggestions and hypotheses. We can only honour signed agreements.&quot;</p>
