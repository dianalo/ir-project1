<p>Belgium's biggest bank, Generale Bank, along with its French unit Fimagest, said Wednesday it will buy a controlling stake in Boston-based fund manager Harbour Capital Management Company Inc.</p>
<p>Generale Bank Managing Director Andre Bergen told a news conference the two would buy at least a 51 percent stake in HCM with a seven-year option to raise its share to 75 percent. The deal is subject to regulatory and minority shareholder approval.</p>
<p>The price paid for the stake in Harbour Capital Management, or HCM, would be based on the company's estimated value of $50 million, with the cost split 66 percent to 33 percent between Generale and Fimagest.</p>
<p>&quot;This is below the average market price, but ... HCM personnel will remain shareholders and will be closely interested in the evolution of the company,&quot; Bergen said.</p>
<p>HCM manages $5 billion in assets for 200 clients, including pension funds and individuals.</p>
<p>HCM is 85 percent owned by company employees. The rest is held by Switzerland's Julius Baer Holding.</p>
<p>Bergen said Generale would, as part of the deal, acquire about two-thirds of the Swiss holding's stake.</p>
<p>&quot;The partnership (with HCM) basically completes the international presence we wanted to have in fund management, based on a strategic decision taken in 1994,&quot; Bergen said.</p>
<p>He said the deal would lift Generale Bank's total funds under management to $57 billion, of which 60 percent is in mutual funds and the remainder in private asset management.</p>
<p>&quot;With this acquisition we are the first Belgian bank to put its asset management on a global basis,&quot; Bergen said.</p>
<p>Generale Bank now has operations in Europe, Asia and the United States.</p>
