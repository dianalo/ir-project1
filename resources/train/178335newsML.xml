<p>Senegalese President Abdou Diouf has lifted a ban on an Islamic movement whose members were involved in 1994 political riots in which six policemen and two civilians were killed, state television reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The television, which announced the move in the run-up to Senegal's November 24 municipal elections, said the Moustarchidina Wal Moustarchidati movement's spiritual leader, Cheikh Tidiane Sy, would meet Diouf in the near future.</p>
<p>Some 200 members of the Islamic group attended a campaign rally held last week by Diouf's ruling Socialist Party.</p>
<p>The movement was banned after a February 1994 pro-opposition rally involving members of the movement in Dakar turned violent. Twenty three members of the movement, whose name means men and women who follow the truth, were later jailed.</p>
