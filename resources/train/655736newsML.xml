<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Thursday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British shares notched up another closing high, encouraged by much weaker-than-expected economic data from the U.S. which spurred the Dow into record ground. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,757.4, up 32.6 points, or 0.69 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's IBIS DAX index rallied to end electronic trade at a new all-time closing high, having made a new record high of 3,739.28 points late in the day. The DAX-30 index closed at 3,707.99, up 30.56 points, or 0.83 percent. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 3,737.16, up 65.29 points, or 1.78 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - Shares closed sharply higher, lifted by market friendly U.S. economic data and optimism that a European Union budget deficit control pact would be approved at an EU summit next week. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,760.27, up 64.08 points, or 2.38 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Blue chips closed more than one percent higher as buyers returned to the market after a two-day consolidation, dealers said. The Swiss market index closed at 5364.2, up 55.6 points, or 1.05 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks powered higher, helped by the yen's tumble against the dollar after remarks by an influential Finance Ministry official on currencies and interest rates, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 20,564.46, up 274.53 points, or 1.35 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks nosedived and the Hang Seng Index closed below 14,000 for the first time since May 13 as sentiment turned bearish on concerns about local property and China's stock markets, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 13,924.34, down 497.18 points, or 3.45 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The share market posted a record closing high, buyers encouraged by good news from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and takeover rumours for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,638.1, up 24.4 points, or 0.93 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Shares, hurt by market disinterest, ended flat to slightly firmer in mixed trade, while a bookover deal in Investec Investment Trust Ltd (Intrust) pushed volumes higher at the close, dealers said. The All-share index closed at 7,292.7, up 6.6 points, or 0.09 percent. The All Gold index closed at 1,147.8, down 16.2 points, or 0.03 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 8,502.1, down 2.6 points, or 1.39 percent.</p>
