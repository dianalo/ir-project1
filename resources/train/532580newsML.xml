<headline>Alitalia says will not change rescue plan.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-04-23</dateline>

<p>Alitalia said on Wednesday it would press ahead with a rescue plan aimed at bringing the debt-ridden Italian airline back to profit despite criticism of the project by the European Commission.</p>
<p>Alitalia managing director Domenico Cempella said in a statement that it was too late to change the plan and accused the commission of &quot;a serious and prejudiced attitude&quot; against the state-controlled airline.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, the European Commission said it had sent a letter to the Italian government suggesting certain changes to plans to inject fresh funds into struggling Alitalia. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>Italy requested EU permission last year for a capital injection of 3.3 trillion lire ($1.9 billion) into Alitalia and the government has already authorised state holding IRI to hand over some 1.5 trillion lire of the funds.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot accept at this point requests for further changes to a plan which we believe in and which is bringing the company back to the path of strong recovery,&quot; Cempella said in a speech to Alitalia directors which was released to the media.</p>
<p>It said the Commission was wrong if it saw the cash injection as state aid.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not understand how the Commission can express perplexity on a recapitalisation plan that fully conforms to the needs of the Alitalia plan, which is, and must remain, a plan for the relaunch of the company,&quot; Cempella said.  </p>
<p>Alitalia chalked up losses of around 1.3 trillion lire in 1996 -- its ninth straight year in the red.</p>
<p>Unions at the company on Wednesday asked for &quot;an urgent meeting&quot; with Prime Minister Romano Prodi in the wake of the European Commission's criticisms.</p>
<p>In a statement, the unions said they were: &quot;deeply worried by the situation regarding the Alitalia plan and the European Commission&quot;.</p>
<p>Alitalia management was locked in bitter conflict with unions for more than a year over plans to slash hefty personnel costs and boost productivity.</p>
<p>A truce was finally called last June when labour leaders agreed to a rescue package which allowed for between 20-30 percent of the group's shares to be reserved for employees after the firm's recapitalisation and eventual privatisation. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501</p>
