<title>UK: UK Oasis brothers put wedding plans on hold.</title>
<headline>UK Oasis brothers put wedding plans on hold.</headline>

<p>Oasis pop star brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, blaming &quot;obsessive and intrusive&quot; media attention, said on Wednesday they had both scrapped their wedding plans until they release a new album in the summer.</p>
<p>Liam Gallagher, lead singer with the hugely successful British band, called off his wedding to actress Patsy Kensit at the 11th hour last week after being besieged by photographers and camera crews.</p>
<p>Songwriter Noel Gallagher scrapped his less publicised Valentine's Day marriage to public relations woman Meg Matthews when their plans were leaked to the press.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment we are going to wait until we finish the record and just take a little time off,&quot; Noel Gallagher told Channel 4 television.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't go through with it because we wanted to do it privately and you can't do anything privately in this country because people like you lot are always following us round with cameras,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>News of the wedding plans by the so-called bad boys of &quot;Britpop&quot; sparked a media furore last week comparable to the Beatlemania of the 1960s.</p>
<p>Liam Gallagher, 24, and his girlfriend Kensit obtained marriage licences for six different venues in a bid to keep the ceremony secret. But they called it off at the last minute when they woke to find that the press and fans had discovered the real venue.</p>
<p>Manchester-based Oasis have become one of Britain's most popular band of the 1990s with hit albums like &quot;Morning Glory (What's The Story)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Gallagher brothers have also achieved notoriety for their foul language, dabbling in drugs and furious rows which led to Oasis abandoning a U.S. tour last year.</p>
