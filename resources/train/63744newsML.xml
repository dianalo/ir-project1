<p>A Canadian mining firm has high hopes of opening Ghana's first underground gold mine for 40 years but has put back a pre-feasibility study until next year to allow time for further test drillings.</p>
<p>Nevsun Resources Ltd said that one year after starting drilling on its Kubi concession just south of Ashanti Goldfields' Obuasi mine results were very encouraging.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that Kubi has the potential to be the first new underground mine in Ghana in 40 years,&quot; the company's vice-president for exploration, Nick Laffoley, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Most gold mining in Ghana is open cast.</p>
<p>Annual production of the mine would be in excess of 100,000 ounces of gold, he predicted.</p>
<p>The pre-feasibility study, postponed from Q4 1996, will be carried out by Canadian Mineral Exploration Ltd of Vancouver.</p>
<p>&quot;We needed more time. We realised that we are still a long way off finding the edges of the ore body. We tested so far only 2 km of the 7 km target there is to be tested,&quot; Laffoley said.</p>
<p>Based in Vancouver, Nevsun Resources Ltd is listed on the Toronto stock exchange. This month it raised $30 million -- for further exploration -- on the exchange without issuing warrants, Laffoley said.</p>
<p>&quot;I know there are a lot of promising projects in Ghana but nobody has such a steep dipping vein which is showing such good continuity as we are seeing,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Nevsun owns 90 percent of the 23 sq km Kubi concession, Ghana's government owns 10 percent.</p>
<p>Drilling in Kubi started in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;There is secondary quartz veining with some visible gold. It is not refractory, that means...we can just use simple metallurgical treatment,&quot; said Laffoley.</p>
<p>Preliminary testing (grinding and leaching with cyanide) gave recoveries in excess of 90 percent, he added.</p>
<p>Nevsun has three rigs on the concession, which is near good roads, a railway, a main electrical power line and a mining town.</p>
