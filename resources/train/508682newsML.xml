<p>Former Soviet republics, proud of speedy dismantling of inefficient centralised economies, said on Tuesday they were trying to shake off the legacy of Chernobyl but moves to close reactors deemed unsafe had been slow.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Lithuania, under pressure from international financial and environmental organisations to close their RBMK reactors, reiterated their commitment to safety as they came under fire at the annual meeting of the European Bank for Recnstruction and Development (EBRD).</p>
<p>Both countries said they intended to eventually close plants at Chernobyl in Ukraine, scene of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, and at Ignalina in Lithuania. But the timetables for closure are uncertain and wrangling continues.</p>
<p>EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere stressed the nuclear safety issue in a speech on Monday, saying the first in-depth safety assessment of an RBMK type reactor had just been completed at Ignalina.</p>
<p>&quot;It produced a comprehensive picture of the risks of this type of plant,&quot; he said, adding that Lithuania now faced fundamental and vital choices. There are about a dozen RBMK reactors in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Environmental groups urged the EBRD and other major lending agencies to get tough on countries dragging their feet on nuclear safety.</p>
<p>The CEE Bankwatch Network, representing environmentalists from 13 countries, told a news conference that future loans should be linked to plant closure commitments being respected.</p>
<p>Lithuanian Finance Minister Algirdas Semeta, who fielded several questions on the issue at a presentation, said the Ignalina plant was one of the safest of these reactors.</p>
<p>&quot;We will try to do our best to improve safety requirements and work with the international community on this issue.&quot;</p>
<p>But EBRD officials said Ignalina was one of the worst in terms of safety. &quot;Ignalina is a very, very big problem,&quot; said one EBRD official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The plant is much bigger than Chernobyl and accounts for 80 percent of Lithuania's energy supplies. But the EBRD official said the international community would be likely to help finance alternative supplies. Ukrainian Finance Minister Ihor Mityukov pointed the finger at the West for problems over Chernobyl, where some 200 tonnes of nuclear fuel remain trapped under a reinforced concrete cover and other reactor units continue to function.</p>
<p>He said Ukraine was meeting its obligations under a memorandum of understanding in 1995 with the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, calling for closure of Chernobyl by 2000 in exchange for $2.3 billion of financing.</p>
<p>That sum, which Ukraine says it needs to cover the costs of safety measures and of providing alternative energy supplies, has since swollen to more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>Yuri Urbansky of the National Ecological Centre of Ukraine accused Kiev of blackmailing the West over the closure.</p>
<p>Urbansky criticised the Ukrainian government for supporting completion of two unfinished Soviet-designed nuclear plants -- Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 (K2/R4) -- instead of exploiting alternative non-nuclear energy sources.</p>
<p>&quot;We will just get two new unsafe nuclear reactors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The environmentalists appealed to the EBRD on the fringes of its annual meeting to reject a loan for the K2/R4 plants which the bank has been considering. An independent panel has concluded that this might not be the best use of funds earmarked to improve nuclear safety.</p>
