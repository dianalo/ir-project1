<headline>INTERVIEW - FKI bid for Newman has M&amp;G support.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Acquisitive British engineering group FKI Plc said on Tuesday its 195.7 million stg hostile bid for Newman Tonks Group Plc had received an undertaking to accept the offer from Newman's largest shareholder M&amp;G.</p>
<p>Both M&amp;G, which has an 11.18 percent stake in Newman Tonks, and Brittanic Assurance, with 2.19 percent in the building supplier, are supporting the offer from FKI.</p>
<p>&quot;We are feeling pretty good (about this bid), the M&amp;G and Brittanic undertakings are quite significant, they must have become very frustrated with Newman Tonks,&quot; Jeff Whalley, chairman of FKI told Reuters in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>The company said Newman Tonks' businesses in Britain and Europe would complement its Hardware Group in North America and would create an international hardware business with turnover in excess of 500 million stg.</p>
<p>FKI has had a busy year on the acquisition front, having recently bought Italian firm Marelli Motori and the Hawker Siddeley Electric power group for a total 235 million stg, but this is the first hostile bid it has made.</p>
<p>&quot;We did try very hard to meet these people on a friendly basis but even with some prodding from M&amp;G we were unable to achieve reasonable conversations with them,&quot; said Whalley.  </p>
<p>FKI's cash and share offer for Newman Tonks at 150p a share values the latter at 195.7 million stg and represents a 46.3 percent premium to the company's closing share price of 102.5p on December 13. By 0947 GMT, shares in Newman Tonks had risen 19-1/2p to stand at 148-1/2.</p>
<p>There is also a cash alternative valuing each Newman Tonks share at 140p a share and the company at 182.6 million, representing a 36.6 premium to the share price.</p>
<p>The cash alternative will be financed partly from FKI's cash resources and from the proceeds of a conditional rights issue to raise a maximum of 152.4 million pounds.  </p>
<p>The rights issue is on the basis of two new FKI shares for every 13 existing shares at 175 pence per share and is conditional upon the offer being declared unconditional.</p>
<p>This would take FKI's gearing to around 80 percent from the post Hawker Siddleley Electric power group purchase level of around 60 percent. FKI said that its interest cover, a measure of a company's ability to pay interest on borrowings, would be strong at around eight times.</p>
<p>FKI said it was confident that Newman Tonks' results could be &quot;significantly improved&quot; under its management. Newman half- year pre-tax profits slipped to 6.5 from 10.7 million stg.  </p>
<p>&quot;We view this as a tale of two managements, seeing the five year track of both these companies -- you must compare our outstanding track record to theirs which is, to say the least, fairly dire,&quot; Whalley told Reuters.</p>
