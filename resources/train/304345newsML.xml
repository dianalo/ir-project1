<p>Growth of Japan's broadly defined money supply average of M2 plus certificates of deposit (M2+CDs) is expected to be steady to firmer in December from November as the gradual recovery in the money supply is likely to continue, economists said on Monday.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters in Tokyo said they predicted the key gauge of money supply to grow by 3.2 percent to 3.5 percent in December from a year earlier.</p>
<p>In November, M2+CDs grew a preliminary 3.3 percent from a year earlier. The data will be released by the Bank of Japan at 8.50 a.m. on Friday (2350 GMT on Thursday).  </p>
<p>Many economists said the 3.3 percent growth last November was exceptionally low, reflecting a surge in commercial bank deposits in November 1995.</p>
<p>Japanese banks faced difficulties in borrowing funds from abroad in late 1995 because the Japan premium -- the extra cost Japanese banks are charged when raising funds overseas -- rose amid concerns over Japan's financial system.</p>
<p>An economist at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd said the expected growth of money supply in December would reflect an increase in private fund demand before Japan's consumption tax rises to five percent from three percent in April.  </p>
<p>Economists' forecasts are as follows:</p>
<p> M2+CD forecasts:		     year on year</p>
<p> BZW					   3.3 pct</p>
<p> Daiwa Bank Research Institute	 3.5 pct</p>
<p> Fuji Securities			   3.3 pct</p>
<p> Merrill Lynch Japan		     3.3 pct</p>
<p> Nomura Research Institute	     3.2 pct</p>
<p> Salomon Brothers Asia		   3.5 pct</p>
<p> Yamaichi Research Institute	   3.2 pct</p>
<p>But an economist at Nomura Research Institute said money supply growth may have weakened to 3.2 percent in December as commercial bank deposits were inclined to fall due to a flow of winter bonus payments to postal savings and foreign bonds.</p>
