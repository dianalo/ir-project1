<p>Labour unrest rippled across France on Friday as bank employees joined airline personnel, junior hospital doctors and car workers in protests against state and private sector reforms.</p>
<p>The junior doctors stormed out of talks with Social Affairs Minister Jacques Barrot, saying the government was refusing to offer concrete proposals to meet their demands for scrapping fines on doctors as part of health spending curbs.</p>
<p>In the fourth week of their strike, they asked Prime Minister Alain Juppe to intervene in the conflict, now affecting 24 of France's 26 teaching hospitals.</p>
<p>Faced with a series of protests, the conservative government has vowed to push on with reforms it says are needed to keep France competitive and help it qualify for European monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>Workers in France's troubled banking sector struck on Friday against government plans to change a 1937 law regulating work schedules.</p>
<p>The change would allow banks to stay open on Saturdays and permit shiftwork. Unions say they are not opposed in principle but object to the government's lack of negotiation on the issue.</p>
<p>Banking sector trade unions would not comment on the strike and planned announcements later in the day.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for France's three largest commercial banks, Societe Generale, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais, said it was too early to tell how many workers were out on strike.</p>
<p>Ground crews at Air France Europe, protesting against terms of a merger of operations with Groupe Air France, planned scattered disruptions throughout the day.</p>
<p>Earlier, a group of ground staff briefly blocked a runway at Paris's Orly airport, causing flight delays of about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>In the Belgian capital, police turned water cannon on irate workers from French carmaker Renault marching in their hundreds through Brussels in protest at plans to shutter their Belgian car plant at Vilvoorde with the loss of 3,100 jobs.</p>
<p>Protesters clashed with police as they threw eggs and stones and tried to break through a barricade in front of the offices of the Flemish regional government in Brussels.</p>
<p>Some 1,000 workers at a Renault plant in Le Mans downed tools for two hours in sympathy with Belgian colleagues.</p>
<p>Renault -- which lost 5.2 billion French francs ($923.4 million) in 1996 -- has also announced plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs in France.</p>
<p>Renault chairman Louis Schweitzer stood firm, saying neither the protests nor a Belgian court ruling that Renault broke labour law by not consulting properly about the closure would change his plans.</p>
<p>France is wary of pushing workers, dispirited by France's record 12.8 percent unemployment, into widespread conflict that could undermine its efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;The French are ready to make sacrifices. The proof is that they have already made many. Now they must get something in return,&quot; the left wing daily Liberation warned in an editorial.</p>
