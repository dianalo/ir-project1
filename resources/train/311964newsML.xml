<headline>House ethics counsel labors over Gingrich report.</headline>

<p>A special counsel worked against a midnight deadline Thursday to provide a badly torn House ethics committee his report on a year-long investigation into charges against House Speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>
<p>After over a week of turmoil and political recriminations, the investigation is expected to culminate next Tuesday in a full House of Representatives vote on punishment for Gingrich.</p>
<p>He is widely expected to be given a reprimand, which would not force him to step down.</p>
<p>Counsel James Cole has been examining charges that Gingrich used tax exempt funds for political purposes and misled the committee. Gingrich has admitted giving the committee false information but said it was unintentional.</p>
<p>Cole was closeted in a room in a House office building on Thursday working on the report. The Republican committee chairwoman, Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, has said it will not be made public immediately, although it was due to be delivered to the committee by day's end Thursday.</p>
<p>An ethics committee official said the committee would not meet Thursday to officially receive the report. The panel also has to decide on a limited schedule for public hearings, but it now appeared that decision would not be made before Friday.</p>
<p>The partisan battle has left the committee shorn of two of its members and soured the opening of a new Congress that was supposed to have set a tone of cooperation and bipartisanship at the start of President Bill Clinton's second term.</p>
<p>The committee's senior Democrat, Representative Jim McDermott of Washington state, was forced to step aside after a furore over a leaked tape of a telephone conversation on the ethics case between Gingrich and his top lieutenants.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Republican David Hobson of Ohio also quit the investigation to even up the committee party ratio at 4-4 instead of the previous 5-5.</p>
<p>Disclosure that McDermott received a tape of an illegally monitored Gingrich cellular phone conversation two days before transcripts of it appeared in the press followed a bitter controversy over the committee's schedule.</p>
<p>The schedule had called for up to five days of public hearings at which Gingrich's admitted transgression of House rules would have been laid out on television.</p>
<p>But Democrats denounced a House-imposed cutoff of the committee's jurisdiction by midnight next Tuesday, which meant the House vote could be no later. They said this would mean the House would be asked to vote without having Cole's report.</p>
<p>Johnson responded by abruptly scrapping the hearing schedule so that Cole could complete his work. She has promised &quot;a hearing&quot; -- but shortage of time means the public session will be much truncated, perhaps as short as one day.</p>
<p>The charges against Gingrich were set out in a &quot;statement of alleged violation&quot; issued on December 21 by a four-member panel that had been investigating Gingrich for two years.</p>
<p>At the same time Gingrich admitted &quot;with great sadness&quot; that he had provided to investigators &quot;in my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements.&quot; He said he had not intended to mislead the committee.</p>
<p>Gingrich also acknowledged he had failed to seek legal advice on whether his use of tax-exempt charitable funds for a college course he taught would violate tax laws. The subcommittee did not take a position on whether the law had been broken.</p>
<p>The charges were among the most serious of many Democrats have made against Gingrich over the past two years. Many Democrats vividly recall his portrayals of their earlier rule in Congress as &quot;corrupt&quot; and his ethics campaign that led Democratic Speaker Jim Wright to resign in 1989.</p>
<p>Some of the charges against Gingrich have led to letters of rebuke to the speaker by the ethics committee.</p>
<p>The committee must decide on an appropriate penalty for the current charges to recommend to the full House. Many assume it will seek a reprimand, which is serious although less severe than expulsion or censure.</p>
<p>A censure could mean Gingrich, who nine days ago became the first Republican speaker re-elected in 68 years, would have to resign the nations's third highest elective position.</p>
<p>Even if he is only reprimanded he would be the first sitting speaker to receive such a penalty.</p>
