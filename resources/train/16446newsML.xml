<p>Argentine bonds surged amid busy trade Tuesday as investors were attracted back into the market by the high yields on offer after the downward trend in recent days.</p>
<p>According to one trader at a large foreign bank, &quot;the impulse came from large gains of the FRB,&quot; which sent local funds scurrying after mainly peso-denominated paper offering yields in excess of 15 percent.</p>
<p>The 5.5 percent dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.80 to 115.15 while Argentina's FRB due 2005 rose 1-1/4 to 78.  </p>
<p>&quot;Local funds were buying peso paper,&quot; said the trader. He added that there was foreign fund interest in Argentine bonds as well, in addition to buying of treasury bills (Letes) which have also seen a sharp rise in their yield in recent days.</p>
<p>The Bocon Provisional 1 due 2007 rose two percent to 75.95.</p>
<p>Traders said the recent decline in Argentine paper has made it even more attractive for foreign investors looking for yield pick-up. &quot;The Argentine market is now the cheapest compared with Venezuela, Mexico and Brazil,&quot; said Roberto Costa Bourdieu, the senior fixed income analyst at Argentina's Banco Rio.  </p>
<p>The trader seconded that, saying some switching into Argentina's FRB from other Latin American paper was reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>Even though none of the worries that hampered the market in the last couple of weeks disappeared Tuesday, there was some cautious optimism that with the return of President Carlos Menem to Argentina today after his visit to Asia, he will put more pressure on Congress to pass the government's recently announced economic measures.</p>
<p>&quot;There could still be some upside in the market,&quot; said the trader.</p>
<p>Still, in the short term, because the economic measures have still not been passed, &quot;our recommendation is to be cautious,&quot; said Bourdieu.</p>
<p>In the money market, one day call money rates rose to 8.95 percent from 8.80 percent.</p>
