<p>The Slovenian SBI index closed up 0.64 percent on Friday as foreign activity kept pushing prices up. Traders forecast that the rise was likely to continue over the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the summer traders will most probably be very busy, much more than we previously expected,&quot; said Nena Jarc, a trader at Nova Ljubljanska banka.</p>
<p>But she said some profit-taking was to be expected over the short term.</p>
<p>The SBI index rose 9.14 points or 0.64 percent to 1,440.2. This week the index fell 1.36 percent after last week's jump of over 15 percent.</p>
<p>Market participants forecast the blue-chip index could rise about 20 percent by autumn if foreign portfolio investors remain as active as they are.</p>
<p>Overall 12 shares rose, five fell and two were flat while nine were untraded. Turnover fell to 255.0 million tolars from 430.4 million.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical wholesaler Salus was the top gainer, jumping 11.38 percent to 14,490 tolars on volume of only 10 shares.</p>
<p>Market participants attributed the rise to a technical correction after recent losses in the share.</p>
<p>Trading company Kovinotehna was the most active, jumping 5.83 percent to 436 tolars on volume of 10,320 shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Kovinotehna is one of the shares which did not rise much over recent days and brokers are obviously searching for an alternative investment,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Hipotekarna banka Brezice led decliners, falling 2.44 percent to 4,000 tolars on volume of 575 shares.</p>
<p>Drug maker Lek had the day's highest turnover, rising 1.73 percent to 33,500 tolars on volume of 3,396 shares for total turnover of 112.3 million tolars</p>
