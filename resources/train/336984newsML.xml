<p>The historic first-ever meeting of All-Star teams representing Europe and Africa should provide a fascinating spectacle at Benfica's Stadium of Light on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Europeans, selected by Rinus Michels of the Netherlands and Berti Vogts of Germany, have a 19-man squad which contains six players who were in Germany's Euro 96 winning squad including captain Juergen Klinsmann, as well as Dutch twins Ronald and Frank de Boer of Ajax, and Zvonimir Boban, AC Milan's highly-talented Croatian midfielder.</p>
<p>The African All-Stars 18-man squad, selected by Rabah Madjer of Algeria and Mawade Wade of Senegal, includes six of Nigeria's Olympic gold-medal winning squad and three of South Africa's African championship winning squad.</p>
<p>Benfica have players in both squads, with Portugal's Joao Pinto in the European camp and Paulo Antonio of Angola in the African.</p>
<p>Most of the African squad play in Europe, and the match, being staged as part of the European Community's &quot;European Year Against Racism&quot;, is also part of a wider plan to build better soccer ties between the two continents.</p>
<p>UEFA, European soccer's ruling body, and CAF, its African counterpart, will also be holding their first-ever joint-executive meeting in Lisbon and, according to a UEFA spokesman, the whole initative &quot;will mark a new era in the relationship between the  African Football Confederation and UEFA&quot;.</p>
<p>UEFA spokesman Graham Turner also said on Tuesday the venue of Benfica's impressive Stadium of Light was a deliberate choice serving to recognise the enormous contribution that Benfica's greatest-ever player Eusebio made to European soccer.</p>
<p>Eusebio was born in Mozambique, but his arrival at Benfica in the early 1960s heralded the club's most successful era when they won the European Cup in 1961 and 1962.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no better link between Europe and Africa than Eusebio....and the climate is much better in Portugal at the moment than in other parts of Europe,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>With virtually the entire African squad based in Europe, there may not be a vastly differing contrast in the style of the two teams, who in any case, will be subject to a series of substitutions throughout the 90 minutes.</p>
<p>The outcome of the match is also relatively immaterial with both UEFA and CAF more eager for an open, attacking and, most of all, sporting match.</p>
<p>While many of the world's top players are involved, there are no English players in the European squad as the premier league has a full programme of matches on Wednesday night. No players with eastern European clubs are involved either due to their winter break.</p>
<p>On Friday, as a continuing part of the anti-racism iniative, the Under-17 Meridian Cup comprisiing four nations from each continent gets under way.</p>
