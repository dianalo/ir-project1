<p>Four former East German intelligence officers go on trial on Wednesday on charges of helping some of West Germany's most wanted guerrillas start new lives in the Communist state and escape justice in the West.</p>
<p>The accused, Harry Dahl, 68, Guenter Jaeckel, 63, Hans Petzold, 53 and Gerd Zaumseil, 49, were all top-ranking officers at the counter-terrorism department in East Berlin's feared Ministry for State Security (Stasi).</p>
<p>The sensational case is the latest to try to establish the extent to which East Berlin supported international guerrilla attacks and punish those behind an &quot;unholy alliance&quot; between the Stasi and the leftist Red Army Faction (RAF), that struck fear into the West German establishment during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>The men's lawyers do not dispute that their clients helped RAF members settle in East Germany from the early 1980s until 1990, when the retired guerrillas were arrested by West German investigators, but they deny preventing the course of justice.</p>
<p>&quot;My client did nothing but help dangerous RAF terrorists fit into society and lead normal lives. He prevented terrorist attacks in West Germany by taking them out of circulation,&quot; argued Jaeckel's lawyer Karl Pfannenschwarz.</p>
<p>The officers' lawyers say East Berlin did not take in the RAF guerrillas because they approved of their bloody deeds, but rather to milk them for information about their methods and, ultimately, to prevent any potential attacks at home.</p>
<p>&quot;Once they moved to East Germany they were under constant surveillance and banned from contact with old comrades who were still active in terrorism,&quot; Pfannenschwarz said.</p>
<p>Three of the guerillas were regarded as some of West Germany's most dangerous criminals. Susanne Albrecht had been wanted for her part in the 1977 murder of banker Juergen Ponto, the chairman of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Silke Maier-Witt and Inge Viett were wanted in connection with the 1977 kidnapping and murder of Employers' Federation chief Hanns-Martin Schleyer and other guerrilla attacks.</p>
<p>The arrests of the 10 retired guerrillas in summer 1990 led to eight convictions. Two were freed because the statute of limitations on their alleged crimes had run out.</p>
<p>The fact that the guerrillas were leading the lives of ordinary East German citizens working and bringing up families had been one of the best-kept secrets of the Cold War -- thanks to the four ex-Stasi officers and their department.</p>
<p>Even West German investigators were surprised to find the guerrillas there after being duped by the Stasi, who had planted photographs of them supposedly in hiding in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Justice officials say the Stasi went to great trouble to ensure their cover was not blown.</p>
<p>The Stasi gave Albrecht a false identity in 1980 and a job in a laboratory in Cottbus. She married an East German scientist who knew nothing of her past and they had a child.</p>
<p>After West German television aired a film about the RAF showing a picture of her, the Stasi secured her husband a posting in Russia for two years. She went with him and he remained oblivious to her previous life.</p>
<p>Maier-Witt worked in Erfurt as a nurse until 1986, when an East German who fled to West Germany reported her to the police. The Stasi got wind of this and destroyed every trace of her identity there, including fingerprints in her flat.</p>
<p>She was brought to Berlin in 1987 for a nose operation and given a new identity and job in the town of Neubrandenburg.</p>
<p>The outcome of the officers' trial may hinge on whether they are judged under federal law, which punishes prevention of justice with up to five years in jail, or East German law.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers say the court has yet to decide on this.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have succeeded once in proving the Stasi's active support for guerrilla activities.</p>
<p>In 1994, one officer, Helmut Voigt, was convicted of aiding a 1983 fatal bomb attack on a West Berlin French cultural centre by &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot;'s band of international guerrillas.</p>
