<title>UK: IPE BRENT RETRACES LOSSES ON GASOLINE, TECHNICALS.</title>
<headline>IPE BRENT RETRACES LOSSES ON GASOLINE, TECHNICALS.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-13</dateline>

<p>IPE Brent crude futures retraced some morning losses after a firm New York opening bolstered by stronger gasoline, brokers said.</p>
<p>September IPE Brent was trading nine cents weaker at $18.76 a barrel at 1440 GMT, around five cents firmer than its miiday level and four cents off its high.</p>
<p>&quot;Gasoline is at the highs and that is why we've gone up, but also technically it looks strong,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>Dealers were looking for another break above $20.00 a barrel on front month WTI as a trigger for further gains on Brent, but said the London contract faced strong resistance at the $18.80/85 level.</p>
<p>Daily high/low support was at intact at $18.55 and key trendline support at $18.40 below this.</p>
<p>October Brent was facing resistance at $18.95 a barrel.</p>
<p>Dealers saw no headlines influencing values, and said arrangements for loading the first tanker to carry Iraqi exports since May appeared well in hand and were therefore factored into the price.</p>
<p>September gas oil was off 25 cents at $170.50 a tonne, reflecting greater product strength from the U.S.</p>
<p>Chartists said gas oil has limited upside potential on Wednesday, capped around $172.50, the bottom of the gap down from last Thursday and Friday's price action, unless the gap is filled.</p>
<p>Gasoline was trading 0.94 cent firmer at 64.70 cents a gallon. Heating was 0.15 cent firmer at 55.25 cents.</p>
