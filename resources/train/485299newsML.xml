<headline>HFS CEO reconfirms holdings sale limit.</headline>
<dateline>PARSIPPANY, N.J. 1997-04-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The chairman and chief executive of HFS Inc reconfirmed on Thursday his intention to sell no more than five percent of his holdings in the company per year, a company statement said.  </p>
<p>HFS, saying it was responding to a report by the Wall Street Journal, said Chairman Henry Silverman had not changed his plans despite the fact that HFS amended his employment contract last June to accelerate the vesting of about 5.4 million options.</p>
<p>Silverman had 6.6 million fully vested options when the amendment was made, HFS said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, the board action limits the number of shares I can sell each year,&quot; HFS quoted Silverman as saying.  </p>
<p>&quot;My intention to realize a very small portion of the same gains other shareholders have realized, for personal financial planning reasons, should not be viewed as anything more than exactly that,&quot; he said. &quot;My personal...activities have nothing to do with my confidence in and long-term commitment to HFS's success.&quot;</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal said HFS had allowed Silverman to exercise immediately all of his company-awarded options.</p>
<p>Citing the company's latest annual report, it said Silverman held options that gave him the right to buy 11.7 million shares, or an 8.4 percent stake in the company.</p>
<p>&quot;Compensation experts say companies rarely step up the timetable under which options make be exercised, known as vesting, unless top executives are weighing competing employment offers,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It also said HFS would guarantee a bank loan of as much as $100 million against the value of Silverman's options.</p>
<p>HFS quoted Silverman as saying the loan referred to was full recourse to him personally as to both interest and principal.</p>
<p>HFS is a franchisor of hotels and residential real estate.</p>
<p>HFS shares were off 3/8 at 56-1/4 in afternoon trade.</p>
