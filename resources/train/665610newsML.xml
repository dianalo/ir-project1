<p>Boston Scientific Corp is comfortable with a 1997 earnings forecast of $1.90 per share, chief financial officer Larry Best said here Tuesday at a Piper Jaffray investors conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm comfortable with $1.90&quot; for 1997 earnings per share, Best said in an interview with Reuters.  </p>
<p>The First Call consensus of 16 Wall Street analysts calls for the medical devices maker to earn $1.87 per share this year, compared to $1.54 per share in 1996.</p>
<p>Boston Scientific also is targeting a gross profit margin for the year of more than 72 percent, Best said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're striving for north of 72,&quot; he said. &quot;Last year was about 72 and then we dropped down into 71. Now, by the end of the year, we'll be safely over 72, approaching 73 percent.&quot;  </p>
<p>After a flurry of acquisitions that caused revenues to explode to about $1.5 billion last year from one-third of that just five years earlier, Boston Scientific in the first quarter of this year saw profit margins and earnings growth slip.</p>
<p>As Wall Street concerns grew about the company's ability to control costs while integrating new businesses, the share price declined.</p>
<p>At mid-Tuesday, shares were trading 59-7/8, up 1-7/8, well off a 12-month high of 71-1/2.  </p>
<p>In his presentation to investors on Tuesday, Best said Boston Scientific this year will begin to realize gains from costly investments in new employees and plant capacity made since 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel ourselves emerging,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Boston Scientific will report revenues of about $2 billion this year and have more than 11,000 employees by year-end, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We think our operating margins will be north of 30 percent and we think our net margins will be at 20 or better&quot; this year, Best said.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next three years, we will grow higher than 20 percent top-line and we will grow bottom-line faster than that ... We gut-wise, see no reason why we can't grow this business 25 percent over the next three years,&quot; he said.</p>
