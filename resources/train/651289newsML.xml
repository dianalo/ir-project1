<p>The CAC index pushed deeper into the red after opening lower, continuing Monday's fall on concerns over the euro and France's wrangling on the stability pact, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no buyers around, there's no support for the market,&quot; said a broker. Monday's relatively low volume suggested the unwinding of short positions in the market was over.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 24.44 points, or 0.91 percent, at 2,661.76 at 0815 GMT. The index had opened down 0.56 percent. The CAC-40 futures contract was down 20 at 2,648 from Monday's close.  </p>
<p>Volume was 855 million francs</p>
<p>* Pernod Ricard was a rare riser on the CAC index, gaining 0.45 percent to 293.2. The drinks group last Friday declined to comment on a newspaper report it was set to buy the spirits business of Larios of Spain.</p>
<p>* Renault dropped 2.61 percent to 130.5. The car maker is holding its shareholders meeting today and unions expect a delay in closing the Belgian Vilvoorde factory. Renault declined to comment on the outcome of the meeting.</p>
<p>Renault workers will be leading today's march on Paris with demonstrators calling for a growth and jobs policy for Europe.  </p>
<p>* Sommer Allibert outperforms the market, rising 0.09 percent to 215.9. The car parts maker said it is not tendering its shares in Canada's Domco, following a bid from U.S. Armstrong World Industries.</p>
<p>* Eurotunnel continues firming, up 2.29 percent to 6.70, following shareholders attempts to get a better deal in the debt restructuring plan. Small investors group Adacte said on Monday it was recommending a rejection of the debt deal due to significant risks even after any restructuring.</p>
<p>* A Gallup-Merrill Lynch poll showed U.K. funds turned negative on European stocks after the French election.</p>
