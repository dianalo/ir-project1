<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine gold prosecutor suffers new razor attack.</title>
<headline>Argentine gold prosecutor suffers new razor attack.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-10-07</dateline>

<p>An Argentine state prosecutor investigating a $70 million gold export scam suffered his second brutal razor attack this year on Monday when unknown assailants beat and slashed him.</p>
<p>The attack followed another assault in February when Pablo Lanusse was slashed on the face and arm. Lanusse's sister was also attacked in June and forced to carve the word &quot;oro&quot; -- meaning gold in Spanish -- on her own forehead with a knife.</p>
<p>A calm Pablo Lanusse told reporters he was grabbed from behind as he left a friend's house in the affluent Buenos Aires suburb of Palermo in the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;He grabbed my arm, twisted it behind me and said 'Lanusse, your worst investment is gold, I'm going to do the same thing to you as to your sister,&quot; Lanusse said.</p>
<p>The attacker, whose face was uncovered, acted with an accomplice. He pistol-whipped the prosecutor, pulled up his shirt and slashed his back, saying before letting him go: &quot;When they give me the order to blow you away, the bullet's going to go into your throat.&quot;</p>
<p>Interior Minister Carlos Corach told Lanusse President Carlos Menem wanted him not to be intimidated and to stay on the case. He promised more protection if necessary for the prosecutor and his relatives.</p>
<p>Lanusse has been assigned permanent bodyguards, but told them to stay behind when he went out this time.</p>
<p>The prosecutor was defiant after the earlier attacks but this time said he was not sure if it was worth continuing. &quot;I have to think about things,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He has led since last year an investigation into the activities of 19 companies which allegedly made false claims for $70 million in export subsidies for gold products.</p>
