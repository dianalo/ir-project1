<p>The overnight interbank rate remained at 5.5 percent on Thursday, pressured by high market liquidity and lending by big local banks as well as foreign banks, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation has not changed. The market remains long and the big banks are still lending,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>But despite the liquid market, interbank rates were expected to stabilise around current levels, he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said some big banks continued to tap cheaper funds offshore and lending at the short-end.</p>
<p>&quot;If you can borrow offshore at 3.8-4.0 percent, why not take advantage of it,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said players remained cautious over the situation in Thailand, although Wednesday's move by the Bank of Thailand to float the baht had no spillover effect here.</p>
<p>Earlier, one-week money was at 6.40/50 percent against 6.30/35 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>One-month money was steady at 7.25 percent, and three-month at 7.35/40 percent against 7.40/45.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were lower across the board.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was down nine points to 92.58, or an implied yield of 7.42 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract fell six to 92.73, or 7.27 percent while March 1998 was down five points to 92.74, or 7.26 percent.</p>
