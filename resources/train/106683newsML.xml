<p>Jakarta's property market remained buoyant in the third quarter of the year but fresh supply caused occupancy rates to decline, property consultant Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;During the third quarter of 1996, demand in most sectors of the Jakarta property market remained buoyant,&quot; Craig Williams, a director of JLW Pacific, said.</p>
<p>JLW said in its quarterly report that net take-ups and fresh entries in the office market in prime locations increased by almost 50 percent over the previous quarter.</p>
<p>It said financial, telecommunication, manufacturing, trading and service firms were the sources of the new demand.  </p>
<p>&quot;But new supply was higher than the net take-up, causing overall occupancy levels to decline to 89.3 percent from 91.0 percent in the previous quarter,&quot; JLW said.</p>
<p>It said average rents remained stable at $13.0 per square meter per month despite the high level of demand.</p>
<p>JLW said fresh demand for retail space was dampened by lack of new stock in the third quarter.</p>
<p>It said there was aggressive expansion in the retail market which was expected to impact on demand levels for retail space over the next 12 months.  </p>
<p>It said average occupancy rates at the end of September were 90.5 percent, 1.3 percent higher than the second quarter.</p>
<p>JLW said average rental rates for primary and secondary retail space remained unchanged in the third quarter.</p>
<p>It said the high volume of new apartment supply caused tenant-occupancy levels in the residential market to fall to 66.3 from 72.7 percent, but cumulative demand for existing condominiums was still stable at approximately 78 percent.</p>
