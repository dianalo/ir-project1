<headline>Kuwait court drops case against former minister.</headline>
<dateline>KUWAIT 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Kuwaiti court on Tuesday dropped a fraud case involving former oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah in response to a request by defence lawyers who cited procedural flaws, lawyers and judicial sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministers' court has accepted the request by the defence lawyers of Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa, which says the court has no jurisdiction over the case,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>Sheikh Ali, who faced charges of making illegal profits from the operations of the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tanker Co (KOTC) in the 1980s, denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&quot;From what I can see, today's ruling means the case does not exist,&quot; said a lawyer, who noted that a detailed version of the ruling would be issued later.</p>
<p>Sheikh Ali's lawyers have repeatedly said the case was invalid because of what they called mistakes by the prosecution and a criminal court that previously handled the case.</p>
<p>The criminal court and the so-called ministers' court were locked in technical arguments about procedures that led to the trial, which has lasted for more than three years.</p>
<p>Sheikh Ali, chief architect of Kuwait's worldwide oil empire, is one of the most prominent members of the Sabah family to be tried in a criminal court and is believed to be the only former minister to be tried for offences related to his duties.</p>
