<headline>IMM currency futures end lower, mark hits new low.</headline>

<p>IMM currency futures finished erratic pit trading lower, but most units ended above the day's price troughs.</p>
<p>Traders tied the final leg back down in March sterling to small sales in thin trading that exaggerated price moves.</p>
<p>&quot;It just followed everything else,&quot; said one floor broker of sterling's renewed decline during the last 30 minutes. &quot;Everybody was getting out of positions, it was thin and a 50-lot could move it.&quot;</p>
<p>Price boards showed estimated volume in March sterling at about 8,000 contracts Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Sterling traders said they also continued to wait for Wednesday's quarterly Bank of England inflation report as well as signs of a solid date for the next U.K. election.</p>
<p>The day's featured move occurred near midday, when March marks skidded abruptly to a new contract low at $0.5960 and nearly a $0.0100 loss as the morning's erosion briefly accelerated.</p>
<p>The quick selloff, which found fuel from sellstops, stemmed from a news wire story that said sources close to the German finance ministry and Bundesbank said Germany would welcome a dollar rise to 1.70-1.75 marks over time.  </p>
<p>&quot;That's what got it rolling,&quot; said a floor broker. &quot;But everybody's still afraid of the central banks.&quot;</p>
<p>Later comments by U.S. Treasury secretary Robert Rubin were viewed as reiterations of his recent remarks and had muted impact, they added.</p>
<p>Rubin said that the dollar fall has corrected to a normal mode, that the strong dollar had helped keep U.S. inflation and rates low, and that the dollar should not be used as an instrument of trade policy.</p>
<p>&quot;What he's saying now is nothing different than what he said at the G7,&quot; said a second broker.  </p>
<p>Brokers said many still looked for more dollar upside soon, although uncertainty about the G7's tolerance for the extent and rapidity of the dollar's advance made them leery of predicting a further straight shot higher.</p>
<p>March yen ended down $0.000026 at $0.008164, marks lost $0.0073 to $0.5980, Swiss francs declined $0.0049 to $0.6989, sterling fell $0.0054 to $1.6354, Canadian dollar eased $0.0001 to $0.7400, Aussie dollar lost $0.0007 to $0.7571, Mexican peso rose $0.000075 to $0.126350.
