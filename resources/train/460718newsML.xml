<p>June gilt futures will struggle to make much headway on Friday and may drift down to support around 108-26, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The gilt market has broken below its recent uptrend and that uptrend is now providing some resistance at 110-05,&quot; said Chase technical analyst Guenter Redeker. &quot;The market will really have a lot of difficulty getting above that level.&quot;</p>
<p>Guenter put initial support at 108-26, then 108-20. If they both cave in, the market will find a key prop at 108-06 he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the market drops below 108-06, the long term uptrend is broken, suggesting significantly lower prices down to 107-19, the low in January, and beyond,&quot; said Redeker.</p>
<p>On the upside, Redeker said gains above initial resistance at 109-15, which also represents down trendline resistance, was needed to relieve the immediate downward pressure on the contract.</p>
<p>&quot;But a daily closing price above 110-05 is needed to open upside potential to 110-29 and once above here it will test 112-09,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By 0824 GMT the June gilt was up 15/32 on the day at 109-13.  </p>
<p>Richard Adcock, manager of technical research at HSBC Futures here, said momentum indicators suggested a more prolonged decline in gilts was on the cards, to take the market back to the longer term objective at 108-00.</p>
<p>&quot;Against this background, with strength set to be held up to 109-25, upside offers further selling opportunities ahead of the expected decline,&quot; Adcock said in a client note.</p>
<p>By 0828 GMT, June short sterling was up three basis points at 93.34.</p>
<p>Adcock said the contract may consolidate for the time being, but added strength would likely be limited to around 93.43.  </p>
