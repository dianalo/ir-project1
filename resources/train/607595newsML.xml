<p>Iran's next president will inherit an oil-dependent and inflation-ridden economy still struggling to find equilibrium nearly a decade after the end of a devastating eight-year war with Iraq.</p>
<p>Iranian voters going to the polls on Friday to choose the successor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani do not need to be told about macroeconomic policy and International Monetary Fund guidelines to know that the economy is sick.</p>
<p>How quickly the new president can provide a remedy to rising prices and unemployment within the confines of the country's existing five-year plan (1995-2000) is left open to question.</p>
<p>Two positive legacies from Rafsanjani are that foreign debt, which soared to more than $30 billion in the early 1990s, has been controlled and the economy, thanks to rising oil prices, posted growth of 4.5 percent in the last Iranian year to March.</p>
<p>Rare IMF praise for an Iranian leader came in December when officials said Iran had successfully weathered the debt crunch and could look forward to more growth and new lines of credit.</p>
<p>And in April IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he was satisfied with Iranian economic policy and praised Tehran for reviving growth and bringing inflation down. Inflation is officially put at 25 percent from 50 percent two years ago.</p>
<p>But save for the $18 billion or so in annual oil earnings, Iran is vulnerable with a crippled industrial sector and an ailing non-oil export sector dependent on stagnant sales of Persian carpets and pistachio nuts to bring in hard currency.</p>
<p>At current rates of production, Iran has enough oil reserves to last it more than 70 years, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not successful in exports,&quot; is how presidential candidate and parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri summed it up in a televised interview on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy and unclear tax rules are common complaints by Iranian and foreign business people alike.</p>
<p>&quot;Industry is bust, privatisation has stalled and there is no proper managerial class,&quot; said one Iranian industrialist.</p>
<p>The vast petrodollars earned by the world's third biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Norway are the economy's and the government's saving grace, but they make Iran open to volatile international oil prices.</p>
<p>The next president's grip on reforming the economy will to a large degree be shaped by what happens on the major oil trading floors in New York and London and whether Washington carries out its threat to slap sanctions on non-U.S. firms that invest in Iran's oil and gas sector, analysts said.</p>
<p>Oil prices have dived to $18 a barrel from $24 in early 1997 but expected higher petroleum demand next winter could give the new president a revenue boost in his first few months in office.</p>
<p>Critical to Iran's plans to attract foreign investment will be a $3.5 billion project to get a foreign consortium to develop its huge South Pars gas field, which will be the backbone of Tehran's quest to be a major gas exporter by the next decade.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said this week the contract -- which would represent the largest single foreign investment in Iran since 1979 -- would go to a group led by French oil firm Total SA.</p>
<p>The French government has repeated this week that it will not deter Total's bid and has said U.S. sanctions aimed at halting foreign energy investment in Iran are not lawful.</p>
<p>Behind the price and politics of oil lies serious domestic economic ills that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Unemployment is officially put at 10 percent, but this disguises underemployment. Many workers have to take on at least two jobs to keep up with 25 percent inflation and annual state salary increases of only 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to work in two jobs for 16 hours a day, six days a week just to pay my rent and pay for food. How am I going to save for a car or get married?&quot; said one Tehran man who splits his day between working as a civil servant and in a shop.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani's bid to privatise bloated state-run industries has stalled, attempts to unify Iran's dual exchange rate have failed and the country has now emerged as the world's largest wheat importer to feed its growing population.</p>
<p>Heavy state subsidies have led to waste, and farmers have found it more lucrative to feed livestock with their wheat than to sell it at a state-fixed price to the government.</p>
<p>Four candidates are running in the election although the bulk of votes are expected to be spread between Nateq-Nouri and former culture and Islamic guidance minister Mohammad Khatami.</p>
