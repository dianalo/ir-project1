<headline>UK's Major says blasts &quot;two-fingered insult&quot;.</headline>

<p>British Prime Minister John Major said on Wednesday it looked &quot;very much as though&quot; two blasts in northwestern England were the work of the IRA.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks very much as though it was a two-fingered insult to democracy at the start of a general election campaign in which Sinn Fein are fielding candidates right across Northern Ireland,&quot; he told reporters. Sinn Fein is the political wing of the banned Irish Republican Army (IRA).  </p>
<p>&quot;I hope very much that IRA/Sinn Fein are not going to conduct their campaigns at the ballot box in Northern Ireland and with bombs on the mainland of Britain,&quot; Major said before leaving London's Heathrow Airport for a campaign trip.</p>
<p>Two bombs damaged railway tracks and signalling equipment at the northwestern English town of Wilmslow early on Wednesday after a coded warning from the Irish Republican Army, BBC radio said. Britain has an election on May 1.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's impossible to judge the minds of people who plant bombs indiscriminately and I find it very diffuclt to understand their mentality,&quot; Major said.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether they're doing this because they think that in some warped perverted way that this will show their supporters that the IRA are still there as a real force -- I don't know.&quot;</p>
