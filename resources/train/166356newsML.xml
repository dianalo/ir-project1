<headline>Brazil Oct coffee exports already set record - FEBEC.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-11-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazilian coffee exports for the month of October already total 1,706,691 60-kg bags based on bills of lading, according to today's bulletin from the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Center.</p>
<p>This already represents the highest monthly figure since September 1993, said an official at the Brazilian Coffee Exporters' Federation (Febec).</p>
<p>Exporters can continue however to ship through to November 10 using certificates of origin issued for October so the final October figure will certainly be higher than 1.7 million bags, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly we are going to have around two million bags,&quot; the official said.  </p>
<p>Shipments in September 1993 reached 2,056,957 bags.</p>
<p>Certificates of origin issued for October reached 2,098,767 bags according to the Coffee Center bulletin so &quot;the September 1993 figure may even be threatened,&quot; the Febec official said.</p>
<p>Should final shipments match certificates of origin, then October shipments would be the highest for five years, stretching back to the 2,180,594 bags exported in November 1991, according to Febec statistics.  </p>
<p>October shipments have benefitted from a delay in finalisation of a state export tax exemption which only took place in the middle of September after a lull in export activity in the first two weeks of the month.</p>
<p>However the pace of shipments in October is not expected to be repeated in November and December, traders said.</p>
<p>This can already be seen in very early statistics for November shipments in the Coffee Center bulletin.</p>
<p>On the first day of November certificates of origin were issued for 50,525 bags against 141,545 bags on the first day of October. --Caroline Bulloch, Rio de Janeiro newsroom 5521 5074151</p>
