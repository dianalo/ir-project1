<p>Canadian bonds closed stronger on Friday, outperforming their U.S. counterparts, following a sharp rally in the Canadian dollar and continued speculation the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar firmed, so that helped and there is some belief that as the dollar firms, the greater the chance of the Bank of Canada easing,&quot; said Michael Gregory, an economist and strategist with Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.25 at C$103.40 to yield 7.697 percent against the U.S. 30-year benchmark which fell 9/32 to yield 6.91 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the two benchmark bonds narrowed to 79 basis points from 83 basis points at the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar closed stronger at C$1.3627 (US$0.7339) in very heavy trading from Thursday's close at C$1.3676 (US$0.7312). The gains came as the unit broke through a key technical level at C1.3650, dealers said.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds had rallied earlier in the session on the back of gains in U.S. fixed-income markets. But Canadian bonds held onto gains as the U.S. market weakened amid profit-taking and a new issue by Ford Motor of US$500 million in notes.  </p>
<p>In other prices, the 7.0 percent of 2006 rose C$0.12 to C$98.96 to yield 7.144 percent. The U.S. 10-year benchmark fell 4/32 to yield 6.68 percent.</p>
<p>The spread between the two benchmark bonds narrowed to 46 basis points from 50 basis points at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The three-month cash bill traded at 3.87 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.03 percent.</p>
