<dateline>CAIRO 1997-03-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak sent condolences to Israel's president after a deadly bomb attack in Tel Aviv, and said that violent acts and killing the innocent were not conducive to peace.</p>
<p>Egyptian newspapers and television on Saturday reported without detail the telephone conversation between the two leaders, whose countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.</p>
<p>Mubarak has played a role in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Tension has been high since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent bulldozers last week to begin a new Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>Egypt said before the work started that it would be insensitive and damaging for Israel to break ground on the settlement in East Jerusalem after so much Arab protest.</p>
<p>On Friday a Palestinian suicide bomber killed himself and three Israeli women in the attack at a Tel Aviv cafe.</p>
<p>The militant Hamas group said it was responsible.</p>
