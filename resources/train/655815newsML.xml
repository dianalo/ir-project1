<p>Lions wing John Bentley was modest in victory after scoring the try of the tour against Gauteng Lions, but admitted his wonderful 70-metre dash had special significance for both himself and his team.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a poor game against Northern Transvaal on Saturday and I'm a vocal guy so it was time for me to put up or shut up,&quot; said Bentley, who skipped past seven players to score in the 64th minute. &quot;I'm glad to have helped put the tour back on the road.&quot;</p>
<p>Tour manager Fran Cotton called the match &quot;a defining moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was an important win following Saturday's defeat and I thought our pack outscrummed Gauteng throughout. When we get the ball we do look good and I think we are capable of perfoming against any of the teams out here.&quot;</p>
<p>The only injury worry for the Lions was Tony Underwood, replaced on the hour with a shoulder and neck injury. Both have been strapped and Underwood will visit an orthopaedic surgeon for a check up on Thursday, but the initial prognosis is good.</p>
<p>Welsh centre Allan Bateman missed the match with a hamstring strain, but the management are hopeful he will be ready for Saturday's match against Natal in Durban. The squad will travel to Durban on Thursday afternoon.</p>
