<p>Zairean rebels accidentally killed at least 23 civilians and injured dozens more last weekend when they opened fire across the Zaire river at Kisangani, eyewitnesses said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The rebels shelled a series of dwellings on the western left bank of the river on Saturday at around 5 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) while attempting to hit retreating Zairean government soldiers, residents said.</p>
<p>Relatives and residents of Lubunga suburb counted the dead and took dozens of wounded to Lubunga hospital near where the shelling took place.</p>
<p>&quot;A bomb landed right on my house and 10 people were killed. My mother and her baby were killed where they stood as well as five of my neighbours on one side and three on the other,&quot; Charlotte Salla, at Lubunga hospital, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Salla was being treated at the hospital after flying shrapnel passed through both her shoulder blades.</p>
<p>Zaire rebels from the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire (ADFL) walked into Kisangani, Zaire's third city, on Saturday, after the government army (FAZ) fled. They now hold more than one fifth of the vast country.</p>
<p>Government troops bolstered by mercenaries, mainly from France and the former Yugoslavia, fought a four-day battle north of Kisangani last week and defended the international airport on Friday before fleeing the city.</p>
<p>The rebels opened fire from (Zaire president) Mobutu's palace on the right eastern bank of the river shortly after arriving in the city.</p>
<p>Residents blamed Zairean troops for the Lubunga incident, arguing retreating forces drew the rebel shelling when they fired in the air to scare bystanders away while looting the railway depot.</p>
<p>&quot;The military were shooting in the air so they could loot the SNCZ (Zaire railways) depot and the rebels fired back because they thought they were being attacked,&quot; said Abedi Binkalunga, 41, a patient at the hospital.</p>
<p>Residents have greeted the city's fall as a &quot;liberation&quot; from President Mobutu Sese Seko, who seized power in 1965 but is now ailing in France with cancer.</p>
<p>They say rebels have freed them from the tyranny of the Zairean army, notorious for extortion and looting.</p>
<p>&quot;For us what is happening here is a type of revolution against dictatorship and in favour of democracy,&quot; said political science student Faustin Batongo, 27.</p>
<p>Kisangani, a city of several hundred thousand surrounded by dense jungle, thrived as the last navigable point on the massive Zaire river around 600 metres wide at that point.</p>
