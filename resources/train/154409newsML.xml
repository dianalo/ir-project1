<headline>FOCUS - Rate hike hits UK stocks, helps sterling. [CORRECTED 14:25 GMT]</headline>

<p>Britain surprised markets by increasing (corrects from &quot;cutting&quot;) interest rates on Wednesday, causing a rapid fall in London stocks and a sharp increase in the value of the pound.</p>
<p>But other European bourses perked up on the strength of Tuesday's healthy close on Wall Street as fresh U.S. data helped calm jitters about inflation in the powerful American economy.</p>
<p>London's bourse, which had registered gains with the rest of Europe in early trading, dropped within minutes of news flashing on dealers screens that the Bank of England was raising the minimum lending rate by a quarter-point to six percent.</p>
<p>Finance minister Kenneth Clarke said he was determined to keep a firm grip on inflation. He had earlier met Bank of England Governor Eddie George to discuss monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have delivered a combination of healthy growth and sustained low inflation unseen for a generation. I am determined to maintain a firm grip on inflation to sustain this well into the future,&quot; Clarke said.</p>
<p>But the rise (corrects from &quot;cut&quot;) caught London's markets off-guard as investors had guessed that George would push for a rate hike after figures showing a jump in British consumer borrowing but had assumed that Clarke would resist so close to a general election, which must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>London's FTSE index reversed its earlier gains and slipped over 0.3 percent as investors digested the impact of increased rates on business prospects and corporate profits.</p>
<p>But Paris and Frankfurt stayed in the plus column in morning trade, concentrating their attention on New York's strong close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wall Street had finished strongly after a smaller-than-expected rise in the third-quarter U.S. wages index, which eased inflation fears and sent interest rates falling to the lowest levels in more than 6-1/2 months.</p>
<p>Many European investors remained on the sidelines ahead of U.S. data on third-quarter gross domestic product due at 1330 GMT and housing for September at 1500 GMT. But more important clues on the health of the American economy may appear in U.S. employment statistics on Friday.</p>
<p>The best performer in Europe was Paris, where stocks climbed by 0.3 percent on the strength of the rebound in New York. But analysts said the short-term trend remained bearish and hostage to Wall Street.</p>
<p>In  Frankfurt, shares climbed at first encouraged by firmer German bonds and Wall Street's close then slipped back to show a gain of only 0.2 percent at mid-morning.</p>
<p>On Currency markets, the pound, buoyant over the past month, benefited from the Bank of England's move giving sterling a better return for investors. It leapt 3/4 pfennigs to 2.4575 marks but government bonds slipped.</p>
<p>The dollar was steady, surrendering centre stage to the mark, which climbed against other continental European currencies amid economic and monetary union (EMU) worries after reports that the European Commission might rule against a French deficit-cutting plan to qualify for EMU.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen warned that &quot;fudging&quot; of the strict single currency criteria were &quot;absolutely killing&quot; for German public confidence in EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;The mark's going to remain pretty firm against the dollar, because of continued misplaced optimism about the German economic outlook and, more importantly, increasing doubts about monetary union,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB here.</p>
<p>The mark rose to 3.3844 French francs in early deals from late Tuesday's European level of 3.3812. It strengthened to 1,009.03 Italian lire from 1,004.15.</p>
<p>The dollar, whose recent strength against the yen has taken it to 42-month highs, stood at 114.41 versus 114.26 late on Tuesday. Many currency traders were awaiting the next slice of U.S. economic data.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1300 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading around 1.5090 marks and 114.41 yen versus 1.5100 and 114.26 in late European business on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCKS AT 1300 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was down 15.3 points at 3978.2.</p>
<p>Germany's DAX index was 5.11 higher at 2,678.73.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC 40 index was up 7.41 at 2133.15.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $380.30 an ounce in the morning, compared to London's Tuesday close of $381.50. Silver was at $4.82, down three cents.</p>
