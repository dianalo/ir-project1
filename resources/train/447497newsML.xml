<p>Global fish production has hit record levels but the world's poor and hungry are unlikely to benefit in the short term, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Its &quot;State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture Report for 1996&quot; also painted a picture of environmental damage as a result of intensive fishing practices, particularly in the booming economies of the Far East and China.</p>
<p>The Rome-based agency put 1995 fish production at a record 112.3 million tonnes, up from a 1994 high of 109.6.</p>
<p>&quot;Early indications were that the 1996 output would not represent any significant changes from the 1995 record,&quot; the Rome-based body said in an accompanying news release.</p>
<p>FAO said the 1995 figures indicated that the increasing demand for fish could be met through better management despite considerable pressure on marine resources.</p>
<p>Fish farming, which has increased rapidly since the early 1980s and plays an important role in providing food for underdeveloped countries, contributed to most of the growth but was also responsible for environmental damage.</p>
<p>&quot;The expansion of shrimp farming has provided considerable foreign currency earnings,&quot; FAO said of southeast Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;However it has contributed, sometimes significantly, to the loss of mangroves. Other major environmental concerns include salination of groundwaters and agricultural land, pollution of surrounding waters and outbreaks of shrimp disease.</p>
<p>&quot;Coastal resources are severely threatened by rapid environmental degradation.&quot;</p>
<p>Although supplies of seafood stocks were keeping pace with demand, FAO warned that this did not mean that the needs of the world's poor and hungry would be satisfied.</p>
<p>&quot;It is conceivable, although not inevitable, that the chronically poor and food insecure will be worse off in the short run,&quot; said Moritaka Hayashi, head of FAO's fisheries department, at a meeting in Rome.</p>
<p>&quot;Price increases and distribution problems could keep seafood, and other protein-rich fish, out of their reach.&quot;</p>
<p>The FAO report urged further exploitation of under-developed resources, the reduction of discard and wastage and measures to prevent overfishing in areas which had reached &quot;their highest level of sustainable exploitation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through such measures an additional 20 million tonnes of landings might be obtainable,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>FAO said a study looking at the 200 top marine fishery resources in the world had shown a &quot;rapid increase in fishing pressure&quot; with those stocks requiring management rising from almost none in 1950 to more than 60 percent in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;For the resources which are presently below their historical peak levels of production, it might be possible to return to these levels,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The report said that its conservative estimate for the demand for fish as food was between 110 and 120 million tonnes in the year 2010, against 75 to 80 million in 1994/95.</p>
<p>In 1995, 31.5 million tonnes of fish was used in fishmeal production. Developed countries accounted for about 85 percent of total global fish imports in 1995 in terms of value.</p>
<p>Japan was the largest importer of fishery products with some 30 percent of the global total.</p>
