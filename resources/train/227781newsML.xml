<p>David Campese performed two tasks with more alacrity than any other player in rugby union -- he scored tries on the field and spoke his mind off it.</p>
<p>To the delight of sports editors and the dismay of officials, praise for his rugby repeatedly jostled for attention with his equally well-developed talent for controversy.</p>
<p>The mercurial winger retired from international rugby on Sunday after Australia's test win over Wales at Cardiff Arms Park, ending a career spanning 14 years.</p>
<p>Campese crossed the try line 64 times -- a world record -- in 101 often dazzling test appearances for Australia.</p>
<p>But such figures pale in comparison to the number of headlines the 34-year-old inspired with his outspokenness.</p>
<p>Administrators, opponents, team-mates -- and even countries -- all became targets for Campese, whose brushes with controversy did nothing to tarnish his reputation as the most naturally gifted individual ever to play the 15-a-side code.</p>
<p>Former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer, for one, remained a gushing admirer of Campese's skill and vision on a rugby field before being succeeded at the helm by Greg Smith in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;David is a natural,&quot; Dwyer once said. &quot;He has the ability to achieve things on a rugby field which simply don't occur to other players.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a view shared by former Australia captain Mark Loane, who once commented: &quot;People like Campo are getting rarer and rarer in all world sports -- the player who is prepared to take risks and do something special. Later on, he should be kept in some sort of glass cage for teaching purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>Dwyer later became increasingly exasperated by Campese's habit of speaking his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone knows there is a circuit loose between Campo's brain and his mouth,&quot; Dwyer exclaimed in frustration last year.</p>
<p>This came after Campese had questioned the wisdom of recalling centre Tim Horan for the 1995 World Cup. Both had a disappointing tournament as Australia surrended their crown in the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Other Campese targets included former England captain Will Carling, whose playing style he likened to a &quot;castrated bull&quot;, and South Africans, whom he labelled arrogant.</p>
<p>England's style of play, which Campese decried as dull and regimented, became a regular target.</p>
<p>But his most stringent tirades were directed at the sport's administrators, whom he repeatedly accused of ignoring the needs of players, and the rule makers who, in Campese's view, have diminished rugby union as a spectacle in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm frustrated because I'm the top try scorer in the world and I can't get the ball...It's all so negative,&quot; a despairing Campese said after Queensland beat New South Wales in 1994.</p>
<p>But whatever his forthright opinions about rugby union, there is no doubting Campese's passion for a sport which took him around the world, including three World Cups, 20 Wallaby tours and stints in Italy's club competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Rugby is my life -- it's all I do,&quot; Campese once said.</p>
<p>Perhaps his finest moment came during the 1991 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand when a reverse pass set up Horan for a crucial try. Campese was later voted Player of the Tournament after scoring six tries in as many matches.</p>
<p>In return for Campese's devotion, rugby has provided the son of an immigrant window maker with a comfortable lifeystyle.</p>
<p>Born in Canberra, Campese left school at 16 to work briefly in a sawmill. After a stint of rugby league, he concentrated on rugby union.</p>
<p>Since making his test debut against New Zealand in 1982, Campese's high profile has earned him lucrative endorsements. In 1991, when he heard speculation that Carling was about to become rugby's first millionaire, Campese replied: &quot;I'd just like to say that happened to me five years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>But it was much more than money which kept Campese playing.</p>
<p>&quot;When I stop playing I will be upset,&quot; said Campese, expressing a sentiment that is no doubt shared today by rugby union supporters around the world.</p>
