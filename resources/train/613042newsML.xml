<p>Following is the text of a speech by French Prime Minister Alain Juppe on Sunday after pollsters said his centre-right coalition was trailing the opposition left after first-round parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The first round of the vote has allowed the French people to express themselves. Many of them did so because turnout was close to that in 1993. There is, nevertheless, a wide margin for mobilisation on the second round.</p>
<p>&quot;The multiplication of candidacies has naturally allowed the expression of the very diverse sensibilities that exist in our country.</p>
<p>&quot;But the French people meant above all to say that they wanted a real change, deep change. And we must listen to this message.</p>
<p>&quot;Real change cannot come from an eccentric coalition of Socialists, Communists, Greens, other leftists, whose programme would put us back 15 years. You can't change by adopting old ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;To win the second round, the presidential majority, around the Rally for the Republic and the Union for French Democracy, must now mobilise all citizens who want true change.</p>
<p>&quot;It must do so by explaining without respite the replies it wants to give to improve the daily life of French people -- unemployment of course, the fight against social exclusion and inequality, the safety of people and of possessions, and I'm thinking especially of our children, youth training, education in general, control of illegal immigration, a more active participation by everyone in decisions that concern them to curb bureaucracy.</p>
<p>&quot;We will all now engage with all our heart, with all our energy, in this decisive combat for France, for its modernisation, for its preparation for the 21st century.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we want a true change, a change with new ideas, a modern change. And we will do it together.&quot;</p>
