<p>The European Commission adopted an ambitious plan on Wednesday to remove all remaining barriers to the creation of a truly single market in the 15-nation bloc by 1999 when it adopts a single currency.</p>
<p>European Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti said in presenting the plan there were still many distortions within the European Union such as different tax regimes which harmed fair competition.</p>
<p>Unless action was taken, cross-border capital flows to avoid high capital income taxes would intensify with economic and monetary union as foreign exchange risks disappeared.</p>
<p>&quot;The single market is the basis for the single currency,&quot; Monti told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;A well-functioning single market does require a degree of harmonisation in the field of taxation of capital income...(otherwise) the functioning of the financial markets, even more so with the single currency, would be further distorted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nearly five years after being officially created, with the abolition of controls at the bloc's internal borders, the single market is still far from a reality.</p>
<p>Besides taxation, the action plan focuses on ensuring existing EU-wide rules are properly enforced, on breaking down remaining barriers in the energy market and the pension funds industry and on giving citizens their fair share of the benefits of a border-free area.</p>
<p>The Commission has failed in the past to make any substantial progress on these issues. But Monti thought there was an increasing awareness of the cost of not having a European company statute or a minimum tax on capital income.</p>
<p>Germany has blocked a deal on the first issue for at least 20 years by insisting that the rest of the bloc adopts its model of workers' representation.</p>
<p>Luxembourg, on the other hand, has fiercely opposed an EU-wide capital tax, but Monti said Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker was open to a global discussion that would also embrace off-shore centres.</p>
<p>Monti hoped to win the political support of EU leaders for the action plan when they next meet in Amsterdam in June.</p>
<p>Although EU governments are usually quick to stress the benefits of the single market, they are often accused of dragging their feet when it comes to respecting common legislation.</p>
<p>A Commission report on enforcement of single market rules shows that it took action against member countries in 283 cases in 1996, a 30-percent increase on the previous year.</p>
<p>The report shows France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium with the worst record for applying the rules or creating barriers notably for imports of cars, foodstuffs and chemical and pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>The Commission said it would start publishing regularly a &quot;Single Market Scoreboard&quot; to encourage laggards to follow the example of top of the class Denmark and The Netherlands.</p>
<p>In a separate decision, the Commission adopted a plan to stop the traffic in goods -- mainly cigarettes and alcohol -- which find their way onto the EU market while in transit through the bloc.</p>
<p>The measures proposed include creation of a sophisticated computer network to monitor goods in transit, sealing lorries and fitting them with 'T' plates. -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800</p>
