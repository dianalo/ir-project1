<text>
<p>South Africa's Rand Mines Ltd said on Thursday that it was withdrawing its cautionary announcement about a possible offer for the firm.</p>
<p>&quot;Shareholders are advised that this proposal has been withdrawn,&quot; the firm said in a statement.</p>
<p>On March 17 the firm issued an announcement saying it had received a proposal which could have included an offer for its ordinary shares.  </p>
<p>A company spokesman said the mine had been a holding firm that had now unbundled its assets and so was being wound up.</p>
<p>&quot;It was unbundled last year and there are no assets in the business,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The statement said as a result of the possible offer being withdrawn the winding up of the company would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;A further announcement relating to the winding up of Rand Mines will be published in due course,&quot; it said.</p>
