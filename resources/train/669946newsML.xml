<p>So you thought you had the lot -- &quot;canned colonial air&quot;, the &quot;I was there&quot; certificates stamped by Hong Kong's Monetary Authority, pink dolphin memorabilia and enough official handover tee-shirts to clothe a small country.</p>
<p>Think again.</p>
<p>Now Hongkong Telecom, which runs the territory's telephone services, has leaped on the &quot;handover 1997&quot; bandwagon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule on July 1 after more than 150 years as a British colony, and the occasion is being marked by days of holiday extravaganzas -- and &quot;unique&quot; souvenirs.</p>
<p>In tandem with China Telecom, a mainland-owned enterprise, Hongkong Telecom is issuing what is billed as the first joint-issue phonecard between two major Asian telecoms.</p>
<p>Catchily entitled &quot;In commemoration of Hong Kong's Return to Her Motherland&quot;, the set of eight cards comes in a specially designed folder &quot;enclosed in an elegant maroon sleeve&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The card designs reflect the symbolic meaning of Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty,&quot; Hongkong Telecom said.</p>
<p>&quot;This unique collection depicts four themes: &quot;Flames of the Opium Wars&quot;, &quot;Historical Turn&quot;, &quot;One Country-Two Systems&quot; (the post-colonial formula agreed on by China and Britain for Hong Kong), and &quot;Return to Her Motherland,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It is issuing 404,590 sets worldwide -- 200,000 allocated for Hongkong Telecom's distribution -- at HK$498 ($64) a set.</p>
<p>Individual cards sell for HK$50 in Hong Kong and 30 yuan in China.</p>
<p>Scenes depicted range from China's 1839 burning of British opium stocks, leading to Britain's seizure of Hong Kong, to the Great Wall of China symbolising &quot;realisation of China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The set is highly collectable,&quot; Hongkong Telecom said.</p>
<p>You bet -- if the thousands who recently queued at the territory's main post office to buy the last Hong Kong stamps bearing Queen Elizabeth's image are anything to go by, Hongkong Telecom is on to a sure thing.</p>
