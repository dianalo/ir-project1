<p>British deputy Prime Minister John Prescott promised to talk tough to water industry chiefs at an emergency conference on Monday to tackle the worst drought the country has faced in 200 years.</p>
<p>Prescott, whose portfolio includes responsibility for the environment, said: &quot;I think the public want me to talk tough, there's been enough talk of crisis management short-term and (that) this problem will soon go away if the rain comes back.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that, it's a long term management of a vital resource, water. It's not being used efficiently and effectively and what we've got to do is bring in the proper regulatory form and to be quite tough with the industry,&quot; he told the BBC.</p>
<p>The new Labour government, swept to power in a landslide election victory almost three weeks ago, has been bitterly critical of the water companies, which were privatised by the previous Conservative government.</p>
<p>The companies were criticised for soaring profits, excessive pay awards to their directors and for failing to do enough to stop leaks from supply pipes -- estimated by some at 800 million gallons (3.64 billion litres) a day.</p>
<p>The criticism led to a pledge by Labour to impose a windfall tax on what it calls the excess profits of privatised utilities. The tax will be used to help get the young unemployed into jobs.</p>
<p>The industry rejects the charges, saying it has cut leaks by over 100 million gallons a day since the drought began in 1995. But the leaks have compounded problems caused by Britain's second dry year in a row, which has left water reserves low.</p>
<p>Monday's meeting in London will bring together water companies, regulators, environmental and consumer lobby groups.</p>
<p>Prescott said he would present a 10 point plan for the industry, including a five year target to cut leaks and improved compensation for customers hit by shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;What I've called this conference for today is not to condemn them (the water industry), not to shout at them...</p>
<p>&quot;Today is to listen to all the arguments and then I intend to set a tough regulatory framework to see that we do get a long term management of water resources,&quot; Prescott said.</p>
