<p>Anti-government protests in Albania showed no sign of abating, with angry investors who lost millions of dollars in savings vowing to keep up pressure until the right-wing government quits.</p>
<p>Sporadic violence, a blockade of the main north-south road and anti-government protests kept tensions high in this Balkan country.</p>
<p>Protests were reported in half a dozen towns in southern Albania, where hundreds of millions of dollars were pumped into the get-rich-quick investment schemes over the past five years.</p>
<p>Even some members of the Democratic Party of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi have begun calling for the government to admit failure, quit and let a new cabinet be formed.</p>
<p>Gezim Zile, a member of the ruling Democratic Party and the Vlore mayor, called on Friday for the government to resign over its failure to contain a monthlong financial crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;They have done nothing to help the people. They must go,&quot; Zile told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He was the first mayor from the ruling party to call for Meksi to quit. Vlore was rocked by protests this week. Three people died and 150 others were injured.</p>
<p>Demonstrators called for an 11th day of protests against the government on Saturday. Similar protests were expected in a half dozen towns in southern Albania.</p>
<p>Scuffles broke out in Fier, also south of Tirana, when 100 riot police tried to keep several thousand protesters from the town's square on Friday.</p>
<p>Protesters, enraged after men attacked a demonstration on Thursday, threw stones at police who quickly gave ground, leaving an uneasy calm.</p>
<p>Protesters erected three barricades on the north-south road between Fier and Vlore, cutting the landlink between Albania's second port and the capital in Tirana.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to separate from the rest of Albania, we do not recognise (President Sali) Berisha any more,&quot; one protester shouted at motorists trying to get through.</p>
<p>Several hundred demonstrators in the southern town of Gjirokaster lit candles in the evening and formed the word &quot;Vlore&quot; in a show of solidarity.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters carrying bouquets of flowers turned out in Elbasan, south of Tirana. One of the slogans of the main opposition Forum for Democracy is &quot;With flowers, not stones&quot;. Protests were reported in the port of Durres and in Cerrik.</p>
<p>Albania, Europe's poorest country, has been swept by protests and riots by investors who lost their life savings in failed investment schemes.</p>
<p>The schemes lured new money with offers of high interest rates and then used the cash to pay earlier investors. A large proportion of Albania's adults seem to have joined the schemes.</p>
<p>Investors blame Berisha's party for letting the schemes flourish and opposition parties accuse him of using cash from the schemes to finance an election campaign last year.</p>
<p>The government, in turn, says opposition groups are trying to exploit the crisis. It impounded about $300 million from two failed funds but steadfastly refused to use government money to reimburse luckless investors.</p>
<p>The head of the state Savings Bank, Bedri Collaku, said $4.3 million had been distributed so far to investors in the failed Populli scheme. The government froze more than $100 million of Populli's assets last month.</p>
<p>Some estimates put the losses from the collapsed schemes at $2 billion, about the size of Albania's annual gross domestic product. Five national schemes have now officially gone bust.</p>
<p>Four more companies, which deny they are pyramids and say they are corporate holdings, have drastically cut back their interest payments and have frozen depositors' assets.</p>
<p>Privately, some officials doubt that cheated investors in Vlore or elsewhere will see any of the money they have lost.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way anybody would get their money back. It's gone,&quot; one local Vlore official told Reuters, requesting anonymity. &quot;But I cannot say that openly -- they will kill me.&quot;</p>
