<headline>Jury selection starts in Cosby extortion case.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-07</dateline>

<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a woman charged with trying to extort $40 million from Bill Cosby by claiming to be his illegitimate daughter and threatening to sell her story to a tabloid newspaper.</p>
<p>A key issue in the trial will be whether the woman, Autumn Jackson, 22, actually believes she is the popular entertainer's daughter, making her actions those of a child trying to exercise her rights rather than an extortionist.</p>
<p>Cosby has admitted having an affair with Jackson's mother but has denied being her father. According to court papers, Jackson was one of many young people whose educational expenses Cosby paid for several years.</p>
<p>The case is being widely watched because the government plans to call Cosby as a witness and he is expected to be questioned thoroughly about his relationship with Jackson and her mother.</p>
<p>Jury selection was proceeding slowly and by noon there had been no substantive questioning of potential panellists. The case is being heard by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan federal court.</p>
<p>The extortion plot could not have surfaced at a worse time for the Cosby family. The entertainer's only son, Ennis, 27, was shot to death in California on Jan. 16, just two days before Jackson was charged. Authorities say the two incidents are unrelated.</p>
<p>Jackson and her alleged accomplice, Jose Medina, 51, are on trial on charges they tried to obtain money from Cosby by threatening to reveal to a tabloid newpaper Jackson's claim that Cosby is her out-of-wedlock father.</p>
<p>A third defendant, Boris Sabas, 42, also known as Boris Shmulevich, is on trial on charges that he helped Jackson and Medina by driving them to the airport and assisting in travel arrangements as part of the scheme.</p>
<p>The three are accused of conspiracy, extortion and violating a federal law that prohibits people from engaging in interstate commerce to commit certain offences. If convicted on all counts, they face possible prison terms of 12 years and fines of $750,000.</p>
<p>In January Jackson's boyfriend, Antonay Williams, 26, of Perry, Florida, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of conspiracy and one count of aiding and abetting extortion. He told the court he helped Jackson and Medina in their scheme by threatening to disclose to the media that Cosby was her father.</p>
<p>The indictment charges that Jackson and Medina tried to pressure Cosby into paying her by contacting Cosby's corporate sponsors and the CBS television network, which broadcasts his comedy series &quot;Cosby.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Jackson also sent a letter to Cosby's lawyer on Jan. 16 saying, &quot;I need monies and I need monies now&quot; and &quot;I don't want to do anything to harm my father in any way, if at all possible to avoid.&quot;</p>
<p>According to court papers, she sent the lawyer a copy of an unsigned agreement with The Globe, a supermarket tabloid, providing for payment for her story.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges she spoke to the lawyer on Jan. 17 and demanded $40 million. She eventually agreed to refrain from publicising her claim in exchange for $24 million.</p>
<p>The two defendants flew to New York on the night of Jan. 17 and met with the lawyer the next morning. They were arrested after they signed a declaration saying that in return for the $24 million they agreed not to sell Jackson's story.</p>
