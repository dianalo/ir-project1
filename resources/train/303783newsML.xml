<p>Egypt and Jordan welcomed on Monday Palestinian and Israeli efforts to clinch a long-delayed deal on Hebron but told the Jewish state that Middle East peace moves depended on its implementation.</p>
<p>&quot;If this agreement is reached and signed it will be a step in the right direction but...everything depends on the implementation of whatever agreement they are going to reach,&quot; Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.</p>
<p>&quot;Implementation is the catchword and we are going to follow that very closely,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Moussa was speaking at a joint news conference with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti as Palestinian and Israeli negotiators hammered out the final details of a deal to hand over 80 percent of Hebron to the Palestinians and also pull back Israeli troops from other West Bank areas.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do not have the will to implement the agreements reached before, the whole process will not only get stuck but the peace will be threatened and this will not be in the best interest of any of the countries in the region,&quot; Kabariti said.</p>
<p>&quot;When the implementation takes place, we would have really returned to the true path which, with the building of confidence, are the basis of the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>A timetable for the West Bank pullbacks, originally due to be completed by September, has been the main stumbling block to a deal on Hebron.</p>
<p>Israel had wanted to complete the withdrawal by 1999 while the United States, the main sponsor of the Middle East peace talks, suggested 1998.</p>
<p>But a surprise visit by Jordan's King Hussein to both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat managed to elicit an initial agreement to pull back the troops by mid-1998.</p>
<p>Kabariti, who accompanied Hussein to Tel Aviv and Gaza on Sunday, described the talks as &quot;a very big step&quot; while Moussa said that Jordan's proposal was based on Egyptian suggestions to ease the deadlocked deal.</p>
<p>&quot;We very much relied on the options provided by (Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak regarding the deadline for the redeployment in the West Bank,&quot; Kabariti said. &quot;And I think we have reached an agreement according to the proposals suggested by President Mubarak, maybe there is an extra 30 days over and above the May deadline that was suggested.&quot;</p>
<p>Egypt and Jordan have peace deals with Israel and take an active role in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Israel's handover of Hebron -- home to 400 Jews and 100,000 Arabs -- was supposed to take place in March under a 1995 PLO-Israeli accord but was delayed for security concerns.</p>
<p>Asked whether he thought Monday's Hebron negotiations represented a softening of Israel's position, Kabariti said: &quot;Very much so.&quot;</p>
<p>Since he was elected in May, Netanyahu has scoffed at peace deals signed by former governments.</p>
<p>His credibility plummeted when he told Arab leaders that he was committed to these peace deals and then said that he refused to trade occupied Arab lands for peace -- the basis of a 1991 Arab-Israeli peace conference in Madrid.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's position has halted peace talks with Syria and Lebanon but Monday's apparent backtracking has drawn criticism from inside his coalition government.</p>
