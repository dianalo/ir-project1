<p>Middle East dirty tanker rates were little changed on Wednesday, while the Mediterranean market showed further signs of softening after its recent spike, brokers said.</p>
<p>The West African sector was fairly lively, with 130,000 tonne vessels to the U.S. Gulf fixed at W92.5/95, amid signs that rates could edge up.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a reasonable number of fixtures today and there isn't that much tonnage around (in West Africa) to the 28th or 30th (Feb). I think we could see rates up to W97.5 in the next day or two,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Trips from the North Sea to the U.S. continued to shadow the West African sector, with very large crude carriers (VLCCs) at W60 and 130,000 tonne ships around W90/92.5.</p>
<p>Brokers reported large numbers of ships in the Med and low enquiry levels. They put 80,000 tonners at about W125, down five points, and 130,000 tonners at W85/90, five to 10 points lower than Tuesday.</p>
<p>VLCCs from the Middle East remained steady after reaching a plateau in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Mideast/west voyages were fixed at W50, Mideast/Japan at about W62.5/65 and Mideast/Singapore at W50, brokers said.</p>
<p>The inter-U.K./Cont sector was quiet with rates for 80,000 tonners assessed at about W100/102.5. &quot;To get rates up, we would need a lot of enquiry and I can't see that happening,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Fuel oil was also inactive, with rates assessed unchanged at W210 for 25,000 tonne cargoes inter-U.K./Cont and W190 cross-Med.</p>
<p>The U.S. sector was softer, with plenty of tonnage available in the Caribbean. &quot;There were a number of swaps with each one refixed at slightly lower numbers to be sure of getting covered,&quot; one broker said.  </p>
<p>He said 70,000 tonne crude cargoes were being fixed at W145, down about five points, with 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil done at W170.</p>
