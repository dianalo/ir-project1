<p>Shenzhen's B share market inched lower in light trading during the Tuesday morning session, with investors sidelined after securities authorities tightened supervision over the stock market, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B share index shed 0.58 points or 0.39 percent to 147.69 on thin turnover of HK$12 million.</p>
<p>The A index gained 8.23 points or 1.83 percent to 458.63, boosted in part by rises in market leader Shenzhen Development Bank after it resumes trade this morning, brokers said. The bank was suspended by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon due to volatile price movements, they said.  </p>
<p>Turnover in the A share market in Tuesday morning reached 4.7 billion yuan.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions held back from heavy trading on signs of tightened supervision from the securities regulators due to unusual price fluctuations,&quot; a trader at China Guotai Securities said.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Development Bank, China's only bank with a domestic listing, ended Tuesday morning up 0.72 yuan at 37.25 yuan on volume of 18.6 million shares, making it the most actively traded stock.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors moved to the sidelines this morning to monitor the bank's performance.  </p>
<p>But the bank's dividend proposal for 1996, consisting of a five-for-10 bonus issue and a cash dividend of 0.2 yuan per share, continued to generate buying interest, they said.</p>
<p>In a statement published in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times on Tuesday, the bank's board of directors said: &quot;We think it is necessary to remind investors to be wary about surging prices&quot;.</p>
<p>Trading in the bank had been suspended for five sessions until last Friday for share trading irregularities.  </p>
<p>The bank closed up 10 percent up last Friday and up 7.77 percent on Monday morning due to investor confidence in the bank's earnings outlook, brokers have said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank performed well in the morning and is likely to perform better in the afternoon given the active trading,&quot; the Guotai analyst said.</p>
<p>A stronger A share market will benefit the B share market, brokers said.</p>
<p>In the B share market, textile concern Victor Onward was the worst performer, slipping HK$0.10 or 4.35 percent to HK$2.20.</p>
