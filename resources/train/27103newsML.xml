<p>Ukraine's central bank will auction three-month, six-month, nine-month and 12-month discount treasury bills on September 3, a central bank official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time we will auction our treasury bills with the new Ukrainian currency, the hryvnya,&quot; the head of the bank's capital markets and exchange department, Vitaly Migashko, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The central bank is setting the denomination of T-bills at 100 hryvnya and is not setting the issue volume in advance. Previously Ukraine's T-bills were issued in units of 10 million karbovanets, the old currency.</p>
<p>One hryvnya equals 100,000 karbovanets.</p>
<p>At the last auction of three-month discount T-bills on August 29, the bank sold 589.4 billion karbovanets worth of paper, with an average annualised yield of 57.30 percent. The average price was 8.750 million karbovanets.</p>
<p>At the last auction of six-month discount T-bills on August 29, the bank sold 692.9 billion karbovanets worth of paper, with an average annualised yield of 64.87 percent. The average price was 7.556 million karbovanets.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry cancelled without explanation the last auctions of nine-month and 12-month bills, which were also scheduled for August 29.</p>
<p>At the previous auction of nine-month discount T-bills on August 20, the bank sold 770 million karbovanets worth of paper, with an average annualised yield of 56.21 percent. The average price was 7.040 million karbovanets.</p>
<p>At the last auction of 12-month discount T-bills on August 16, the bank sold 4.695 trillion karbovanets worth of paper, with an average annualised yield of 56.65 percent. The average price was 6.390 million karbovanets.</p>
