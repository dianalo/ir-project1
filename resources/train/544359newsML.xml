<p>Algeria's prime minister said on Monday the government was looking closely at mass privatisation of state-owned firms through a system of vouchers.</p>
<p>&quot;This technique, authorised by the new privatisation law, will be thoroughly discussed by the tripartite partners (workers, business leaders and government representatives),&quot; Ahmed Ouyahia was quoted by the official Algerian news agency APS as telling a news conference in Algiers.</p>
<p>Early in March, Algeria adopted a law to try to woo investors into buying state-owned firms, many of them overmanned and inefficient.</p>
<p>The law amended 1995 legislation to allow for incentives to investors who saved jobs and upgraded the firms they acquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Mass or popular privatisation consists of distributing free (share) coupons in privatised enterprises to beneficiaries,&quot; Ouyahia said.</p>
<p>&quot;This technique will allow workers to get at no cost 40 percent of the privatised concern, another 40 percent to youth, with 10 percent for Moudjahidine (former nationalist fighters) and their sons, and the remaining 10 percent to the victims of terrorism,&quot; said Ouyahia.</p>
<p>He gave no details on which category of young people would get free vouchers for privatisated companies.</p>
<p>Unionised workers, former fighters from the 1954-62 independence war against the French, and their sons, along with &quot;victims of terrorism&quot; make up the core political support for the government camp running for June 5 parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Victims of terrorism&quot; are those caught up in the conflict in which about 60,000 people have died since early 1992. The violence started when the authorities scrapped a general election in which Moslem fundamentalists had taken a big lead.</p>
<p>Algeria faces new elections in June and Ouyahia is one of around 8,000 candidates for the 380-seat National Assembly.</p>
<p>In an attempt to brush aside opposition allegations that his latest policies are designed to attract voter support, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;The government studied this technique, which has been implemented by other countries, wanting to make it suitable to Algerian realities, outside of any politicking.&quot;</p>
<p>Ouyahia did not say how many state-owned firms would be sold off through planned mass privatisation. Officials said earlier the government would start by offering about 250 firms and industrial units for sale in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Algeria expects to speed up privatisation after the June 5 general elections that are part of a drive by President Liamine Zeroual to stabilise the North African country, officials said.</p>
