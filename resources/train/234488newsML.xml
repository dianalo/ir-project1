<p>French unions called a nationwide oil strike for December 10 on Wednesday, in an effort to widen their assault on oil company cost-cutting from a week-old refinery strike at French giant Elf Aquitaine.</p>
<p>France's five main unions urged workers who have been preparing various isolated protests for December 10 to turn that day into a full one-day strike in all parts of the oil industry, a senior official at the Communist-backed CGT union said.</p>
<p>Such a strike would theoretically cripple an eighth of Europe's oil refinery output. But both oil company and union officials said it was far from clear yet how solid it would be.</p>
<p>Protests outside Elf, France's largest oil firm, have so far been limited to brief go-slows at various refining plants.</p>
<p>But one key union toughened its position towards negotiations on the Elf strike on Wednesday as workers voted to extend a shutdown of Elf's three French plants into Thursday.</p>
<p>The Socialist-backed CFDT said it would go to talks between unions and employers set for Thursday on pay and conditions, but would refuse to negotiate pay, only restate its demands on jobs.</p>
<p>Elf officials have said Thursday's talks are meant to try to resolve the strike but employment is not on the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;The management has replied to our demands with scorn,&quot; the CFDT said in a statement.</p>
<p>The strike over plans to cut 330 jobs at Elf's Antar refining unit has halted a quarter of French refining output.</p>
<p>Officials at Elf and other oil firms said the closure of its plants was creating a logistical nightmare and raising the cost of keeping petrol stations and other key oil outlets supplied.</p>
<p>Oil traders said Elf had been forced to buy petrol on the European market this week to replace some of the 100,000 barrels (3.5 million U.K. gallons) per day it manufactures in France.</p>
<p>International petrol (gasoline) prices have been rising during the strike.</p>
<p>But there were no reports of shortages, with most tanks, ironically, still full following a 12-day blockade by truck drivers which hit oil facilities in a strike ending last week.</p>
<p>An Elf spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Elf strikers made a gesture to the company on Wednesday by offering to allow road deliveries from the stricken plants for several hours on Thursday in exchange for talks.</p>
<p>Production inside the refineries would stay at a standstill, however, union officials said, adding there had been some rows with management about how many people should be left behind on full pay to keep the gas-filled distillation towers safe.</p>
<p>The refineries have combined capacity of about 440,000 barrels per day -- three quarters of Elf's European total.</p>
<p>France has total refinery capacity of 1.7 million tonnes. It has only tiny volumes of domestic crude oil production.</p>
<p>Unions leaders say 1,700 jobs are threatened across France through plans by Elf and other firms to slim down and reorganise the French refining industry, plagued by overcapacity.</p>
<p>Besides Elf, subsidiaries of two the world's largest oil firms, Royal/Dutch Shell and Exxon Corp, have been singled out for threatened disruption next week.</p>
<p>Esso France announced plans to cut 10 percent of its workforce in a restructuring plan a week ago.</p>
<p>A three-week-old strike meanwhile dragged on at a plant operated by Elf chemicals subsidiary Elf Atochem near the southeastern city of Lyon. The protest is also over job cuts.</p>
