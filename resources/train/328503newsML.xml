<p>The prices of U.S. Treasury securities were slightly higher Thursday morning after gaining slightly overnight in Europe.</p>
<p>The long bond was up 6/32 at 95-30/32 to yield 6.82 percent.</p>
<p>On tap this session are initial unemployment claims for the week of January 18 at 830 EST/1330 GMT with consensus estimates of 347,000 new claims. At 1300 EST/1800 GMT, the Treasury will auction $12.5 billion of five-year notes, unchanged from last month's offering size.  </p>
<p>The dollar posted solid gains overnight, firmly above the 119 yen threshold and steady in tight ranges above 1.64 marks after the German Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;There's really not a thing going on. We opened a little higher, but it's quiet and should be all week,&quot; said Alan Levenson, money market economist at UBS Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Levenson said he expected a cautious mood among market participants ahead of the Treasury's auction this afternoon.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Fed's Beige Book was released early and some players said that created some disruption ahead of the two-year note auction.  </p>
<p>Kevin Flanagan, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., didn't buy that theory, however.</p>
<p>&quot;When was the last trime the market reacted to the Beige Book in a significant way? The more likely explanation is that the Street took on a lot more paper than it originally thought it had to and had to start discounting it,&quot; Flanagan said.</p>
<p>The two-year initially was expected to bring in yields of 5.99 percent to 6.00 percent and only fetched 5.98 percent.</p>
<p>Because of that, the five-year may see a higher yield, Flanagan said. In when-issued trading, the five-year was at 6.32 percent in early trading.  </p>
<p>The two-year note was at 99-23/32, unchanged to yield 6.02 percent. The five-year was up 1/32 at 99-6/32 to yield 6.32 percent and the 10-year was up 2/32 at 99-21/32 to yield 6.55 percent.</p>
<p>Three-month bill rates were down one basis point at 5.02 percent. Six-month rates were unchanged at 5.11 percent and year bill rates were also unchanged at 5.29 percent.</p>
