<p>Modern-day gunrunners are buying weapons in states with weak gun laws and selling them illegally to criminals in other states, a report released by three members of Congress said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A handful of states like Mississippi and Florida are typical shopping stops for the nation's gunrunners, who then sell the weapons in states like New York, New Jersey and Illinois, the losers in this deadly game of firearms smuggling,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The report cited figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that 1,243 guns bought in Florida were used in crimes in other states last year, the most from any state. Texas was next with 1,068 guns used in out-of-state crimes, followed by South Carolina, Georgia and Virgina, each with more than 900 guns used in crimes in other states.</p>
<p>&quot;For years we have suspected that many criminals get their guns from out-of-state. Now we can prove it,&quot; Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said. &quot;It's time to put these gun bazaars out of business.&quot;</p>
<p>Schumer joined with Democratic Sens. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Dick Durbin of Illinois in releasing the report and introducing a bill to make gunrunning a federal crime.</p>
<p>It would impose a federal sentence of three years for anyone without a federal gun dealer or collector's license who smuggles five or more guns across state lines in a one-year period. A second offense would bring a five-year sentence.</p>
<p>Gun kingpins, who smuggle 50 or more guns in a one-year period, would get a 15-year sentence, and a 25-year sentence would be imposed if one of the guns was used to kill or seriously injure someone.</p>
