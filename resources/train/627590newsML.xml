<p>Spain's budget secretary said on Friday that Italy's high levels of deficit and debt made it unlikely it would be part of Europe's economic union from the start, although its presence would be desirable.</p>
<p>Quoting the latest EU Commission report, Budget Secretary Jose Barea said Greece would not meet the criteria and it was &quot;probable that Italy also would not&quot;.  </p>
<p>&quot;It (Italy) also has substantial divergences in deficit and above all in debt, with respect to the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty,&quot; Barea said in a radio interview. &quot;This is the opinion of the Commission itself in its latest report.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether he could picture a monetary union without Italy, a G-7 member and co-founder of the European Community, Barea said he could.</p>
<p>&quot;If you told me it would be without France or Germany, I would say the union could not be founded, but without Italy, without Spain or Britain, yes,&quot; Barea said.</p>
<p>He also said a softening of the criteria was unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be very appropriate if Italy were in, but if it does not meet the criteria, there is not going to be any softening of the criteria because for the Germans a strong currency is very important,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Italy has recently made a very big effort to meet Maastricht convergence criteria...but it was further than us from the level of 60 percent of debt to GDP (gross domestic product).&quot;</p>
<p>Barea reiterated that Spain had a 90 percent chance of joining the EMU from the start and said Spain was certain to meet all the Maastricht Treaty criteria by the year-end, except the debt to GDP ratio.</p>
<p>&quot;Spain will end 1997 with a debt to GDP ratio at around 65 or 66 percent...but the Treaty, which asks for that value to be at 60 percent, also says it's enough to show a falling trend,&quot; he added. Spain debt to GDP stood at 69.3 percent in 1996.</p>
