<p>State owned Air Malta said on Wednesday it expected to announce a loss in the financial year ending on March 31, the first time it would do so since 1975.</p>
<p>Chief executive Louis Grech, who took over in November, told a press conference that Air Malta made a pre-tax profit of Lm4.2 million ($11m) in the year ending March 31, 1996 but that was the result of profits by subsidiaries and non-routine items of income which were not expected to be repeated.</p>
<p>The airline's core operations recorded a loss of Lm2 million mostly due to a drop in tourism and overcapacity on new routes.</p>
<p>Losses from core airline operations are expected to rise to Lm4 million this year and profits from subsidiary companies and extraordinary revenue are not expected to make up the balance.</p>
<p>Grech said a report by the international auditing firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand had concluded that in recent years the airline floated capacity far in excess of demand.</p>
<p>A sharp increase in scheduled services had been made at the expense of profit and it was not clear that non-profitable or marginal routes would develop into good markets. Some are now being pruned back.</p>
<p>The new routes were introduced shortly after Air Malta bought three Avro RJ70 regional airliners for $100 million and started promoting Malta as an airline hub.</p>
<p>&quot;There are today very serious doubts on the suitability of these aircraft within the context of Air Malta's network...(the airline) now faces the unpleasant possibility of having to replace relatively new planes on which substantial loans exist,&quot; Grech said. $1:Lm0.38c</p>
