<p>The high-flying dollar soared to its strongest levels in years in European morning trade on Wednesday, with analysts saying that promising economic fundamentals are set to push it further on its bullish way.</p>
<p>The dollar kept firmly above the key level of 1.6400 marks and just below 119 yen by Europe's midday, although the market later cooled off slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a huge appetite for the dollar/mark out there. German exporters are selling into the dollar rally, but the demand is so huge, the market is just soaking it all up,&quot; said a trader at a British bank.</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6420 marks at midday, off its high of 1.6455 which was its strongest level since June 1994, but still way above its late Tuesday level of 1.6247 marks.</p>
<p>It strengthened on a combination of pro-dollar economic fundamentals and relief that Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in a speech on Tuesday made no comments that might damage the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone was worried yesterday that Greenspan would say something that would hurt the dollar. But he didn't, so now all the people who were waiting are in the market this morning,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>In his testimony to the Senate budget committee, Greenspan gave an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy. He said labour markets were &quot;exceptionally tight&quot; but added that this had not led to accelerated wages or inflation.</p>
<p>However, Greenspan tempered his assessment by warning that the surprising lack of inflation pressures could not last for ever and the Fed needed to be wary.</p>
<p>&quot;The comments from Greenspan and other Fed officials overnight tended to be on the hawkish side,&quot; said PaineWebber international economist James McKay.</p>
<p>&quot;And although we don't expect a U.S. rate hike any time soon, the market is really starting to confirm that Fed policy is now looking towards higher interest rates in the next couple of months,&quot; McKay said.</p>
<p>The dollar also got ammunition from factors away from home -- an interest rate cut in Italy, German data showing a muted business climate, concerns over Russian President Boris Yeltsin's health, and the Japanese finance minister's comments that the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed with the U.S. stance favouring a strong dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all coming together -- people have set in their minds clear targets of the mid 1.60s against the mark...and 120 to 125 against the yen,&quot; said Stephen Hannah, director of research at IBJ International in London.</p>
<p>The dollar was standing at 118.95 yen at midday, softer than its 47-month high of 119.20 hit earlier but more than one yen above late Tuesday levels of 117.85.</p>
