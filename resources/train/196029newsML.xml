<p>Government spending and foreign exchange flows eased the South African money market shortage at the weekend but did little to entice short-term interest rates lower, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>While the Reserve Bank indicated the shortage lower at 8.745 billion rand on Saturday from 8.8 billion rand on Friday, dealers said call rates remained stranded at 16.75 percent, with some banks quoting as high as 17.00 percent.</p>
<p>Three-month NCD rates hovered unchanged between 16.95 percent offered and 17.20 percent bid, while the 90-day BA rate was quoted at between 16.30 to 16.60 percent from 16.30 to 16.75 percent previously.</p>
<p>&quot;The shortage has come off a little bit, but there no change in rates...it is still very tight,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Pressure on commercial banks' margins has grown in recent weeks following a renewed assault on the rand, resulting in a cash crunch in the money market.</p>
<p>Business Day newspaper reported on Monday that the commercial banks had appealed to the Reserve Bank to help avert a prime rate hike by easing pressure in the market.</p>
<p>Governor Chris Stals said the central bank was considering helping banks gain access to liquid assets held by government's pension fund investment manager.</p>
<p>But dealers said that while central bank assistance might help banks meet their statutory liquid asset requirements, it was unlikely to result in a substantial reduction in the shortage.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the shortage to remain high until the end of the year and into January,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Some traders speculated that anther option the central bank might use would be to reduce its second tier borrowing rate -- currently 0.75 percentage points above Bank rate at 16.75 percent -- similar to a move on June 25.</p>
<p>One trader felt, however, that Stals would be loathe to assist commercial banks, which he has blamed for rampant private sector credit extension.</p>
<p>&quot;From our side we don't see any change. Stals will not be seen to make monetary policy any easier,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>While an interest rate rise was possible under current market conditions, dealers said such a move was unlikely at this stage primarily because of political furore which greeted the last unilateral interest rate hike by the banks in May.</p>
<p>One trader said that by keeping the pressure on commercial banks, Stals had effectively hiked the Bank rate.</p>
<p>&quot;He has effectively been able to increase the Bank rate by keeping the market tight because he has pushed all short-term rates up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But he hasn't had to push up Bank rate which is politically unacceptable. He has the best of both worlds at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Bank rate currently stands at 16 percent while the prime lending rate of banks is 19.25 percent.</p>
