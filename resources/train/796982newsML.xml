<p>The rupee weakened mildly against the dollar to close at 35.7250/7300 as demand from India's largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) re-emerged on Wednesday from near oblivion, dealers said.</p>
<p>The spot rupee opened the day steady at 35.715/720 a dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;They (SBI) were buying dollars throughout the day, bidding from 35.7150 upto 35.7350,&quot; a dealer at a foreign bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;They bought close to $100 million today,&quot; another dealer said. &quot;There was hardly any demand from anyone else.&quot;</p>
<p>A leading term-lending bank and a leading Ahmedabad-based textile major were selling dollars on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>SBI, whose demand usually moves the forex market, was in the background in recent months, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been at centre-stage, buying dollars to arrest the rupee's rise against dollars, dealers said.</p>
<p>Some dealers said SBI was buying for the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp among others, but neither SBI or ONGC officials were immediately available for confirmation.</p>
<p>Forward premiums opened lower but edged up during the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Far-forward premiums were little changed but near term premiums ended some two paise lower,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>December maturity dollars saw some activity but the forward market was largely dull during the day, dealers said.</p>
<p>The six-month annualised forward premium closed Wednesday at 4.53 percent, almost unchanged from the previous 4.54 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Permission to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to take forward cover on their debt investments is the right way but not enough to cause a strong move (in the exchange rate),&quot; a European bank said in its India commentary on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway it seems we will celebrate India's 50th birthday with a strong rupee!&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The 50th anniversary of India's independence falls on August 15 -- a national holiday -- at a time when the Indian currency is one of the few that has stayed strong against the dollar.</p>
