<p>The U.S. State Department on Thursday formally asked Georgia to waive the diplomatic immunity of a Georgian diplomat involved in a five-car crash in central Washington in which a teenage girl was killed.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials said the Georgian government had informed the U.S. embassy in Tbilisi of its intention to recall the diplomat, Gueorgui Makharadze, and they expected him to leave the United States shortly.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the Georgian ambassador to Washington was called in on Thursday afternoon and asked to ensure that Makharadze not leave the country until a decision had been taken on the waiver.</p>
<p>Burns said Secretary of State Warren Christopher was personally concerned over the incident, which prompted an outcry in Washington over the issue of diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p>He was writing to Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze on Thursday night to back up the U.S. requests.</p>
<p>In the letter, Burns said Christopher would reaffirm the request &quot;that Georgia lift (Makharadze's) diplomatic immunity so that he might face trial here in the United States and that he might not leave the United States until we get an answer from the Georgian government.&quot;</p>
<p>Christopher would also say he was &quot;concerned by the direction the case is heading.&quot;</p>
<p>Burns said Georgian ambassador Tedo Djaparidze had given no response to the U.S. request on Thursday but Washington hoped to have a formal answer from Tbilisi on Friday.</p>
<p>But a senior U.S. official said the U.S. embassy in Tbilisi received a diplomatic note from the Georgian government on Thursday saying that it was going to bring Makharadze back to Georgia.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's every reason to believe that they are going to send him out of the country shortly, and that's one of the reasons why we decided to take this step,&quot; said the official, speaking on condition he was not identified.</p>
<p>Despite previous reports that the accident victim, 16-year-old Joviane Waltrick of Kensington, Maryland, was American, U.S. officials said on Thursday she was Brazilian.</p>
<p>Officials said that under the rules of diplomatic immunity Makharadze could not be stopped from leaving the United States, but would not be able to return unless he agreed to submit to U.S. judicial procedures.</p>
<p>Officials said the diplomatic note appeared to conflict with a statement on Thursday by Georgian Foreign Minister Irakly Menagarishvili that his country would not recall Makharadze before the result of an investigation by U.S. authorities into the Jan. 3 accident.</p>
<p>The office of U.S. attorney Eric Holder on Wednesday wrote to the State Department saying it believed it had sufficient evidence to prosecute the diplomat if his immunity was waived.</p>
<p>Spokesman Kevin Ohlson said Makharadze, 35, could face charges ranging from negligent homicide to second degree murder, which carries a sentence of 20 years to life, if he were prosecuted.</p>
<p>Burns said the request for a waiver of Makharadze's immunity was unusual in being lodged before receipt of a full report from the U.S. attorney. U.S. officials said they expected this late next week.</p>
<p>Burns said Christopher's letter to Shevardnadze did not contain any threat to withold U.S. aid to Georgia despite a demand this week by Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) that no more aid should be sent there unless Makharadze's immunity was waived.</p>
