<p>--Mexico stocks seen up on follow-through, rate cuts</p>
<p>--Peso likely firm on capital inflow, U.S. long bond yield</p>
<p>--Cetes overnight rate seen down from high prior close</p>
<p>Dealers saw shares opening with upside potential on Wednesday due to momentum acquired from sharp gains chalked up on second quarter earnings during the prior session.</p>
<p>Stocks would also benefit, they said, from a 102 basis point drop in 28-day Cetes rates at Tuesday night's central bank primary auction. The benchmark rate dropped to 17.70 percent, the lowest level since the 1994 peso crisis.  </p>
<p>Technical analysts situated resistance at 4,830 points on the IPC index, up from Tuesday's close of 4,797.49.</p>
<p>Traders saw the peso shrugging off the primary rate fall on capital inflow triggered by the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond, which was up 13/32 early Wednesday to yield 6.36 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers forecast a trading range of 7.7550/7.7850 per dollar for the 48-hour peso. Pre-open bids stood at 7.7640/7.7680 per dollar, compared to Tuesday's close of 7.7815/7.7850.  </p>
<p>Overnight rates on Cetes were seen opening down from the prior close of 20.00 percent that had been reached after a late speculative spike, dealers said.</p>
