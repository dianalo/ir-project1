<p>School board members have suspended a 15-year-old student who brought a steak knife to school to cut up brownies, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Amber Nash began serving her 10-day suspension February 4 and will be able to return to school February 18, said Tom Saylor, superintendent of Gobles Public Schools in southwest Michigan, outside Kalamazoo.</p>
<p>The length of the suspension was decided Monday night in a meeting between the board and Nash's parents.</p>
<p>While state guidelines call for a 180-day expulsion for bringing weapons to school, school administrators had recommended Nash be suspended for 33 days, Saylor said.</p>
<p>&quot;After some additional review, the board felt the appropriate action, which is supported by the administration staff, was to issue a 10-day suspension,&quot; Saylor said.</p>
<p>Although Nash never intended to use the knife, which has a four-and-a-half inch blade, in a harmful way, she exercised poor judgment and the punishment was meant to send a message, he said.</p>
<p>In a statement, board President Richard Beam said: &quot;There is no doubt that Amber had no intentions of using this knife for any other reason than cutting brownies for her friend. The end result, however, no matter how innocent the intent, resulted in a knife finding its way to school.&quot;</p>
<p>Nash could not be reached for comment.</p>
