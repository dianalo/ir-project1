<p>Consumers' confidence in the economy hit a six-year high in August and their expectations for the next six months also rose, the Conference Board said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Confidence levels about both current and future business conditions are higher now than at any time since early 1990,&quot; said Lynn Franco, Associate Director of the board's consumer research centre.</p>
<p>The Conference Board, a private business research organisation, said its index of consumer confidence rose to 109.4 in August from a revised reading of 107.0 in July.</p>
<p>&quot;The surge in confidence in July, coupled with the August advance, suggests that consumer attitudes may be on an upward trend after remaining stagnant for more than a year,&quot; Franco said.</p>
<p>The expectations component of the August index rose to 97.7 from a revised 95.0 in July and the current conditions component was up at 126.9 from a revised 125.0 in July.</p>
<p>The index is based on a survey of 5,000 households conducted monthly for the board by NFO Research Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p>Almost 29 percent of the surveyed families said current business conditions were &quot;good,&quot; up from less than 28 percent in July, the board said.</p>
<p>The proportion of consumers expecting business conditions to deteriorate fell to 7.4 percent from 8.2 percent in July, it added.</p>
<p>The percentage of families expecting their incomes to go up increased to nearly 24 percent from 21 percent in July.</p>
<p>The board said confidence rose in most regions of the country compared with readings at this time last year.</p>
<p>The Pacific Coast rose most dramatically, climbing nearly 24 percent from the June, July or August figures in 1995, the board said.</p>
<p>The only region showing a decline was the Rocky Mountain area, down about 3 percent, the board said, although it added that confidence levels in that area continue to be &quot;at comparatively high levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Employment was the one area where the survey showed mixed expectations, the board said.</p>
<p>Twenty-three percent of families said jobs were &quot;hard to get,&quot; up slightly from July, while 15 percent said they expect more jobs to become available during the next six months, up from 14 percent in July.</p>
