<p>Deutsche Bank AG unit Deutsche Financial Services Corp, which is expanding its core products and changing its organization, said Monday that Melvin Brown, president and chief executive officer, will become vice chairman effective January 1, 1996.</p>
<p>Brown, who has led the company since 1977, helping it to grow from to a $6.0 billion company today from $50 million 20 years ago, will take a more strategic role, it added.</p>
<p>Part of Brown's responsibilities will be assumed by Geoffrey Lyon, who will become head of Deutsche Financial Services' inventory finance unit.  </p>
<p>Lyon will report to Robert Martin, president and chief executive officer of Deutsche Financial Services Holding Corp.</p>
<p>Deutsche Financial said it will streamline its corporate structure, combining Deutsche Financial Service and Deutsche Financial Holding, effective January 1, 1997. Martin will be president of the combined company.</p>
<p>Deutsche Financial is a unit of Deutsche Bank North America, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to assemble a full range of high-value financing products and services that support the manufacture and distribution of goods on a global basis,&quot; Martin said, commenting on the expansion of core products.</p>
<p>Deutsche Financial, which provides inventory financing for distributors and dealers in many major durable goods markets, will expand its core products and services. This includes adding asset-based lending and end-user financing, which will support the distribution of products from manufacturer to end-customer, the company said.</p>
<p>Deutsche Financial, which has operations in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, plans to enter new markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia.</p>
<p>In addition, the inventory finance unit will be reorganized along industry segments served, instead of by geography.</p>
<p>Martin said Deutsche bank, which acquired the financing operations in May 1995, has good expectations for Deutsche Financial and is committed to support its growth.</p>
<p>&quot;We will explore the opportunity of following our customers to major world markets,&quot; he added.</p>
