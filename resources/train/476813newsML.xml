<p>East Asian grain buyers are largely holding back on their corn purchases ahead of key impending U.S. agricultural data, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) quarterly stocks and planting intentions report is due out later in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;We're more interested in stocks rather than planting intentions. Local feed makers are likely to enter the market if the USDA announces bullish figures,&quot; a corn trader at a major trade house in Japan said.  </p>
<p>Japanese dealers have already finished buying their April/June requirements of U.S. corn, but so far have only covered 10 percent of their July/September shipments.</p>
<p>Premiums were quoted at between 93 to 94 U.S. cents a bushel over the CBOT May contract, they said.</p>
<p>In South Korea, dealers said local buyers were a little leery of the USDA report and were largely staying on the sidelines having already covered most of their needs up to August shipment.  </p>
<p>&quot;Most of our clients will take some break since they have covered their requirements for far forward shipments to August,&quot; a trader with a foreign grain trading house in Seoul said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the East Asian grains market, the Philippines is to tender, on a a snap basis, for 40,000 tonnes of corn for mid-April shipment and local traders confirmed the purchase by two mills of 100,000 tonnes of Canadian wheat.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese feed market remains battered by the effects of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease which has ravaged the pork industry and is likely to cause a sharp drop in demand.  </p>
<p>&quot;Feed producers are still working on reducing their corn and soybean inventories,&quot; Taiwan Formosa Oilseed manager Steven Kuo told Reuters.</p>
<p>Major Taiwanese grain importers said they expect a reduction in corn imports of about 1.2 million tonnes, or 19 percent of the island's 6.5 million tonnes of imports each year.</p>
<p>Regional demand for Chinese corn though, remains generally good on attractive prices relative to U.S.-origin and South Korean buyers dismissed talk of imports from China being pinched by logistical log jams.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have not seen any problem with Chinese corn deliveries to our clients,&quot; one trader in Seoul said.</p>
<p>A trader with South Korea's National Livestock Cooperatives Federation (NLCF) also dismissed the market talk.</p>
<p>&quot;We have heard (of) the rumour but there is no problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Since January, South Korean buyers have bought at least 1.022 million tonnes of Chinese corn through tenders and private negotiations, traders said.</p>
<p>China is also still offering corn to Japan at a quote of about US$135-$136 a tonne FOB Dalian, traders said. About two local traders have bought corn from this origin, they said.  </p>
<p>But other Japanese buyers are holding off believing Chinese offers are still too high.</p>
<p>&quot;Chinese corn is not cheap enough, with freight costs around $20 (a tonne) China is just trying to export corn to solve their storage problem in corn growing regions, not to earn hard currency,&quot; another corn trader in Tokyo said.</p>
<p>South Korean flour makers Cheiljedang Corp and Dongah Flour Mills Co Ltd are expected to tender this week to buy 23,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat for shipment between May 5 to June 5, traders said.  </p>
<p>The freight rate from the Pacific Northwest to South Korea was unchanged at $15.50 a tonne, while the rate from the U.S. Gulf was also flat at $25.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, Pacific Northwest freight costs were seen at about $14.00 a tonne while quotes from the Gulf of Mexico ranged between $24.00 and $25.00 a tonne, both for Panamax-sized March shipments.</p>
