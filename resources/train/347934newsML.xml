<p>The welter of official comments following the dollar's recent scamper higher has seen traders become wary of central bank intervention, but around current levels financial analysts reckon the authorities are reasonably relaxed.</p>
<p>The velocity of a currency's move has always been more important than the scale in prompting intervention and while the dollar has rushed higher of late, the rally has been fairly orderly and should not have worried authorities in the U.S., Germany and Japan too much, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent comments from Japan about the yen's weakens have been mixed and the market has been left somewhat confused as to whether the authorities there think it is a good or bad thing,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy.</p>
<p>&quot;But the general view in the market is that they are starting to get a bit twitchy about it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>There was talk last week that the Bank of Japan was intervening to hold back dollar/yen but dealers were unable to confirm that it was the case. Intervention can be far more effective if it is visible because it sends a much stronger signal to the market, analysts noted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, traders are backing off slightly and are cautious of holding too long dollar positions with the great and the good currently meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos and ahead of next week's Group of Seven (G7) meeting in Berlin.</p>
<p>Since the dollar sank to an all time low of 79.70 yen in April 1995, the G7 nations have taken every opportunity to talk it higher, talk which was backed up with concerted intervention which went a long way to reversing the dollar's fortunes to the recent high above 122 yen.</p>
<p>With that cohesion still deemed to be solid among the G7 -- or more importantly the G3 (the U.S., Japan and Germany) -- the market has been happy to push the dollar higher, but it is now getting close to levels where that cohesion may be tested, analysts said.</p>
<p>They said a lot depends on the United States point of view, particularly in the light of recent complaints from the U.S. auto industry which is feeling the pinch of the higher dollar in terms of export competitiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything was happy last year because Japan and the U.S. had agreed on a dollar at 110 to 115,&quot; said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International.</p>
<p>&quot;But I detect some uncertainty because Japan is not sure what America wants. Therefore it all comes down to how the U.S. views this.&quot;</p>
<p>This could lead to a slight change of tack at next week's G7 with comments along the lines of welcoming the dollar's recent rise but adding that it has now reached an appropriate level.</p>
<p>Analysts doubt very much that they will try and talk it still higher.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still good reasons to buy the dollar but at the moment it is all about what G7 will or will not say,&quot; said CIBC's Coleman.</p>
<p>Coleman agreed that the key was the U.S. stance on the dollar and noted that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had been plugging the firm dollar policy for some time and there had been no sign that his view was softening.</p>
<p>Germany, the other factor in the equation, is also probably not too worried about the mark's weakness on the dollar despite recent official comments that the dollar's rise had gone far enough.</p>
<p>With growth coming via exports, analysts reckon Germany is keen to see things remain the way they are and only inject the occasional note of caution just to slow things down if need be.</p>
