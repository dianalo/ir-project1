<headline>New York mayor denies report of affair.</headline>

<p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Monday vehemently denied the story few had read but much of New York was talking about -- that he was having an affair with a 32-year-old aide and his marriage was ruined.</p>
<p>From his morning appearance at the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange to his regular news briefing at City Hall, Giuliani called the report in Vanity Fair magazine &quot;untrue&quot; and &quot;malicious.&quot;</p>
<p>The report comes just three months before the city's mayoral election in which Giuliani is the heavy favourite for re-election. He has gained wide support as the crime rate has fallen and the city is perceived to be more livable.</p>
<p>Vanity Fair reported in its September issue, which does not reach New York's newsstands until Wednesday, that the 53-year-old mayor was allegedly carrying on an extramarital affair with communications director Cristyne Lategano that started during out-of-state campaign trips in 1994.</p>
<p>The article, which quoted unidentified sources and unidentified former aides, predicted that Giuliani and his actress-reporter wife Donna Hanover, 46, would separate after the November mayoral election.</p>
<p>&quot;I really think the more I talk about it, the more I just dignify the article,&quot; Giuliani told reporters. &quot;I think the best thing for me to say about the article is it's untrue, it's false, it's based on unnamed sources.&quot;</p>
<p>Hanover issued a brief statement that did not address the article, but referred to her charitable activities as the mayor's wife and her family.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a family and we will remain a family,&quot; Hanover told reporters outside her office on Monday. Giuliani and Hanover have two children, Andrew, 11, and Caroline, 7.</p>
<p>Lategano, who rose swiftly through the ranks of the Giuliani administration from a young campaign aide to leading adviser, also said the reported affair was not true.</p>
<p>&quot;When a woman works closely with her male boss, it's called intimate. When a man does the same, it's called loyal,&quot; said Lategano, known at City Hall as a workaholic.</p>
<p>Gossip columnists have hinted at a possible affair before but Vanity Fair was the first publication to actually come out and report it as true.</p>
