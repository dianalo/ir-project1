<p>The corporate rather than the personal sector is likely to bear the brunt of tax rises in the UK July 2 budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown sticks to his election pledges, a Reuters survey published on Tuesday showed.</p>
<p>Reuters polled 20 economists on June 19 and 20 and their views indicate Brown is likely to raise a net four billion stg from the budget, with a reduction in tax breaks on share dividends -- Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) -- garnering the bulk of the extra revenue.</p>
<p>This will be in addition to the so-called &quot;windfall&quot; tax planned for Britain's privatised utilities. The survey suggests Brown will raise five billion stg from this one-off levy.</p>
<p>Tony Blair's reborn Labour Party swept to power at the May 1 election having endured 18 years in the wilderness. It promised voters that it had abandoned its old high taxation, high spending policies and its first budget will be used to underline that change.</p>
<p>It will take no risks with its new-found popularity, analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are likely to be disappointed if there is nothing aimed at the personal sector but I think anything like that would be vetoed by Tony Blair because of the danger of breaking the spirit of the manifesto,&quot; Co-operative Bank economist Andrew Snowball said.</p>
<p>The UK economy is extremely buoyant with consumer spending soaring after an injection of cash from building society mergers and flotations. Financial markets fear the economy will overheat if measures are not taken to cool consumer demand.</p>
<p>But the survey suggests the markets need to look to interest rates as the main tool of demand management and not to taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;The big issue is still what the balance between monetary and fiscal policy is going to be and my suspicion is that we are moving towards a more aggressive monetary stance,&quot; IBJ Chief economist Stephen Hannah said.</p>
<p>Hannah is looking for a net fiscal tightening of five billion stg and warns that official interest rates are likely to end the year at 7.0 percent, 1/2 point above their current level, as the Bank of England tries to rein in demand. Seventeen out of the 20 economists expected a change in ACT, making it far and away the most likely tax option, according to the survey.</p>
<p>Six respondents expected it to be cut to 10 percent from the current level of 20 percent while three predicted a total abolition.</p>
<p>But on the personal taxation side, only nine of those surveyed expected even the most vulnerable tax break, mortgage interest relief at source (MIRAS), to be reduced or abolished. MIRAS is currently available at 15 percent on the first 30,000 stg of a mortgage.</p>
<p>A reduction in the MIRAS tax break is seen as the least unpopular way of raising funds from the personal sector, given that mortgage holders have been the main beneficiaries of the building society handouts. But the majority of economists, 11, expect it to remain intact.</p>
<p>Far from increasing personal taxes, Brown may even use the budget to introduce the promised new bottom income tax rate of 10 percent, down from the current starting rate of 20 percent, according to six of those surveyed. But 14 said the rate will stay unchanged.</p>
<p>Brown is likely to paint a fairly encouraging picture of the economy overall, in the new economic forecasts which will be another key feature of the budget. Analysts expect him to say gross domestic product will increase by 3.5 percent this year, well above the long-term trend rate of 2.25 to 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>But he is also predicted to say that inflation will end the year on target at 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>The overall picture of the public purse should also be encouraging with Brown poised to predict a deficit of just 16.0 billion stg for fiscal 1997-98, its lowest level for six years. This will confirm that there is no overwhelming need for sharp tax rises, analysts said.</p>
