<p>President Jerry Rawlings opened a $9 million plant for the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Ghana Ltd, pledging government measures to encourage the private sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Government will adopt sustainable policies and incentives to further improve the environment for the growth of the private sector expected to play a lead role in the development of the economy,&quot; Rawlings said at the ceremony in Accra on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The plant has installed capacity of 24,000 crates per hour but currently produces at 80 percent or 21,000 crates hourly.</p>
<p>The government has a 55 percent majority holding while Coca-Cola Co International owns 25 percent. The Africa Growth Fund holds 20 percent.</p>
<p>Rawlings said the decision of Coca-Cola International to invest in Ghana was in recognition of the viability of the government's industrial and investment policy and the faith multinational companies had in Ghana's economy.</p>
<p>He said the government had gained nearly $20 million by ceding part of its stake in the bottling company, which it was previously the sole owner of.</p>
<p>Rawlings, a former military ruler who won civilian elections four years ago, has been praised by Western creditors for championing economic reforms and liberalisation in the region. Reforms in Ghana are beginning to attract foreign investors, notably to the mining sector.</p>
