<p>Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the world shrank to 845 million pounds ($1.4 billion) in December, official figures showed on Wednesday, undercutting forecasts and casting doubt on how much the strong pound is hurting exporters.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics said Britain's worldwide trade gap narrowed from more than one billion pounds in November. Economists had forecast a global deficit around 1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Britain's trade shortfall with non-European Union countries also fell to 398 million pounds in January, well under December's 640 million gap and economist forecasts for a deficit of around 750 million pounds.</p>
<p>Treasury Economic Secretary Angela Knight said Britain's trade performance was as strong as it had been in a decade. &quot;The competitive strength of British industry shines through today's trade figures,&quot; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>But economists, despite being wide of the mark with their forecasts, maintained that Britain's terms of trade could not withstand the pressure applied by the pound forever, unless the currency began to start falling soon.</p>
<p>Sterling has rocketed about 16 percent in little more than six months as measured against a basket of major currencies. A strong pound has the effect of cutting import prices but pushing those for exports higher.</p>
<p>Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said the trade figures were much better than expected and suggested the pound had yet to really hit exports.</p>
<p>Britain exported goods and services worth 13.987 billion pounds in December, up from 13.754 billion the month before.</p>
<p>&quot;Exports were better than expected in both the global and non-EU figures,&quot; Barr said. &quot;It may be several months until we can identify the impact of sterling strength feeding through.&quot;</p>
<p>Exports to non-European Union countries totalled 6.36 billion pounds in January, much higher than the 5.97 billion-worth shipped in December.</p>
<p>One of the problems about unravelling the effect of a strong pound on Britain's trade position is that initially it helps.</p>
<p>Known as the &quot;J-curve&quot; effect, the impact of a change in the price of imports and exports does not show up until the levels of demand catch up. As a result, with imports cheaper, exports dearer but trade volumes unchanged for a while, the trade gap should narrow in value terms in the short-term.</p>
<p>This time has proved no exception. But once Britain's trade partners adjust, the deficit position will deteriorate. The key question is how much damage is done.</p>
<p>&quot;The deterioration in the deficit should only come through slowly as (currency) hedging activity limits the damage and J-curve effects help to keep nominal imports in check,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America.</p>
<p>Philip Uglow, economist at Union Plc, said better trade figures were to be expected for a while. &quot;But they will widen later in the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The pound has been at the heart of a row between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George over whether interest rates should be raised.</p>
<p>Clarke wants rates held at six percent and says the pound's strength will douse inflationary pressures by depressing import prices. The central bank says the currency effect has only a one-off impact.</p>
<p>The ONS also produced a set of inflation data on Wednesday that are harmonised with European Union statistics. The new calculation showed annual inflation at 2.2 percent in January.</p>
<p>Data released earlier this month showed January inflation at 2.8 percent. Core inflation, excluding home loan payments, was at 3.1 percent, well above the government target of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>The new data are calculated slightly differently, excluding local council taxes which make up part of Britain's established retail price inflation index but including prices for new cars, computers and air fares, which domestic RPI does not.</p>
<p>The ONS stressed that the new figures would not replace RPI and said the EU figures were less comprehensive.</p>
<p>Clarke, bolstering his claims that rates should stay put, said the British economy was experiencing low inflation whichever calculation was used. ($ = 0.610 British Pounds)</p>
