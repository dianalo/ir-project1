<p>3 MONTH     CLOSE  * SUPPORT * RESIST * RSI14 * MA10 * MA30</p>
<p> COPPER     2280/84 *  2250   *  2320  *  33   * 2335 * 2447</p>

<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - July 16------------------</p>
<p>Three months copper is expected to probe the downside towards support at $2,250 and $2,230 a tonne, but a hefty backwardation should underpin the market, analysts and traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Aluminium was soggy and should also test lower levels, they added.  </p>
<p>COPPER -</p>
<p>Three month prices formed a bearish outside day on the charts on Tuesday, closing near their lows at $2,278 after touching a high of $2,337, indicating further downside moves.</p>
<p>Support was pegged at $2,250, the lows of July 10 and 11, and $2,230, the low of July 9. In addition, the 200-day moving average at $2,261 should also help slow any move lower.</p>
<p>But the cash/threes backwardation was still above $200 per tonne and should keep prices from spiralling out of control. It was slightly narrower early on Wednesday, indicated at $225/$240, compared to $240/50 at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;Look for further initial weakness, but with the spread remaining firm around $240 back, copper remains vulnerable to upside spikes,&quot; said analyst Martin Squires of broker Rudolf Wolff.</p>
<p>Resistance would be seen at the psychological $2,300 mark, then around $2,315/18, at $2,337, Tuesday's peak, and at $2,365, the top of a gap.</p>
<p>&quot;On the upside, a close above $2,302 is needed to relieve downward pressure and target $2,335,&quot; said Harry Creates, chartist with broker AMT.</p>
<p>At 0745 GMT three months LME copper was quoted at $2,265/70, down about $15 from Tuesday's late close.  </p>
<p>ALUMINIUM -</p>
<p>The market would explore lower levels after shedding $21 on Tuesday but support should kick in at the lower levels.</p>
<p>&quot;A sloppy close indicates a test of the $1,555/60 area,&quot; said broker Brandeis in a commentary.</p>
<p>&quot;Reasonable scale-down buying should be seen at these levels, however, and unless there is a breach of support at $1,540, the market is expected to remain in its recent range,&quot; Brandeis added.</p>
<p>Other analysts pegged support at $1,542-$1,545 based on the lows of April 14, June 25 and July 9, and at the February 11 low of $1,534.</p>
<p>On the upside, resistance would be seen around $1,585, the top of the recent range before Tuesday's spike higher.</p>
<p>At 0745 GMT three months aluminium was quoted at $1,551/54, down $13 from Tuesday's late close.</p>
