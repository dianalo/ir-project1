<p>U.S. debt futures finished mixed and little-changed after dull afternoon range-trading.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very quiet,&quot; said a Treasury bond futures floor broker. &quot;There was no feature, maybe a little shortcovering.&quot;</p>
<p>The market was transfixed by Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting after Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony Thursday stoked speculation about the possibility of a pre-emptive strike at inflation through credit tightening.</p>
<p>Greenspan said Thursday that core CPI is likely to come under pressure from a tight labor market and if the Fed acts next week the effect on inflation may not be felt for a while.  </p>
<p>Traders wondered whether the Fed will raise the Fed funds rate target, currently at 5.25 percent, and possibly the five-percent discount rate.</p>
<p>&quot;I think all bets are on already,&quot; added the T-bond futures floor broker. &quot;There might be a little bit more curve-flattening....&quot;</p>
<p>Prices in the long end continued to outperform those in the short end as traders said the market over the last few trading session factored in the possibility of a 25-basis-point rate increase. A minority said they looked for a half-point rise, and a few others looked for no change.  </p>
<p>The session's highlight occurred before midday when T-bond futures downticked as the dollar fell on a wire report, later denied by the Fed in a statement, that Fed vice chairwoman Alice Rivlin had indicated Thursday that there were limits on Treasury secretary Robert Rubin's support for a strong dollar.</p>
<p>Futures nudged back up when the Fed denied the report.</p>
<p>April T-bond futures-options expired uneventfully at midday, options brokers said.</p>
<p>June T-bonds ended up 2/32 at 108-23/32, notes eased 1/32 to 106-15/32, muni-bonds lost 2/32 to 113-07/32, Sept T-bills lost 0.030 bps to 94.355, Eurodollars eased 0.015 to 93.810.</p>
