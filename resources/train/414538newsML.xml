<p>The Non-Aligned Movement criticised the annual U.S. drug certification process Monday, saying it violated the group's basic principle of non- intervention in the affairs of independent states.</p>
<p>The United States on Friday &quot;decertified&quot; Colombia -- chairman of the movement since 1995 -- for the second consecutive year on the grounds that it had failed to prove itself a trustworthy ally in the global fight against drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Movement rejects the continuing use of unilateral mechanisms of evaluation, qualification and certification, since these are inconsistent with the principles of equal sovereignty of states and non-intervention,&quot; said a statement from Colombia's foreign ministry, issued in the name of all 113 Non-Aligned member countries.</p>
<p>It added that Non-Aligned countries -- who compromise a majority in the United Nations -- were jointly committed to fighting against any &quot;coercive and unilateral policies&quot; that might be imposed by industrialised northern countries on the developing or underdeveloped South.</p>
<p>The five other countries on the U.S. drug blacklist, Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria, are also members of the movement.</p>
<p>Countries decertified by Washington as part of an annual process required by the U.S. Congress face an immediate cutoff of most U.S. aid and possible trade sanctions.</p>
