<p>Indonesia must cut its bureaucratic red tape to maintain its competitiveness in attracting foreign investment to the minerals and mining sector, Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, Director General of Mines, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my intention to straighten up things in Indonesia so that we can be as competitive as Chile,&quot; he told a reception sponsored by the Metal Mining Agency of Japan.</p>
<p>He cited a survey of country risk for mineral investment, published in the February 1996 issue of Australia's Mining Monthly, showing that Indonesia's bureaucratic risk worsened from the prior year despite improvement in all other areas.</p>
<p>He added that there was growing competition for exploration capital from other developing countries in Asia and South America.</p>
<p>He said Indonesia's Directorate General of Mines was committed to cutting the time period for approving contracts of work between the government and foreign mining companies to no longer than six months.</p>
<p>He acknowledged, however, that some interdepartmental problems could take several years to resolve.</p>
<p>He said it was unlikely that the government would adopt a special tax regime for the mining sector, although some tax incentives for mining investment were enacted in 1994.</p>
<p>Also unlikely anytime soon, he said, was a move to allow foreign mining investment on Java, as the heavy population density of the island increased the potential for land disputes and environmental issues.</p>
