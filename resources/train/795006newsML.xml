<headline>KL OVERNIGHT RATE REMAINS AT 5.5 PCT ON LENDING.</headline>

<p>The overnight interbank rate remained at 5.5 percent on Tuesday due to lending by both foreign and local banks, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The overnight is a bit liquid and capped below six percent. Foreign banks are still there but Malaysian banks are also coming out to lend,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>Earlier, other interbank rates fell due to continued lending by agent banks of the central Bank Negara Malaysia, dealers said.</p>
<p>One-month money was last quoted at 7.25 percent against 7.5 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>The three-month rate was at 7.5 percent against 7.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;(Bank Negara) agents were lending on the one-month and three-month this morning,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>The central bank has been injecting funds over the past month to help ease market tightness and bring interbank rates down, dealers said. Bank Negara's massive intervention in the foreign exchange market in June to defend the ringgit from speculative attack had caused a liquidity squeeze in the money market.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were up across the board to reflect softer interbank rates.</p>
<p>At 0800 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up five points to 92.46, or an implied yield of 7.54 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract rose one to 92.65, or 7.35 percent while March 1998 was up two to 92.73, or 7.27 percent.</p>
