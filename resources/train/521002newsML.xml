<p>The fear of early polls has become a key issue for India's defeated United Front alliance as it sought on Friday to elect a new leader to replace defeated Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, alliance officials said.</p>
<p>They said the 15-party coalition, which lost power in a vote of confidence in parliament last week, was moving towards electing a new leader from India's populous northern Hindi-speaking region, the main theatre of electoral battles.</p>
<p>The alliance faces the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as its main opponent in the northern states.</p>
<p>Its chief rival in the southern states was the Congress party, which has offered to support a new United Front government after forcing the fall of Deve Gowda on April 11, alliance officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;With this in view, the next prime minister should be from the north,&quot; a senior leader of the influential Left Front, which is part of the United Front, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the Left Front, which has 52 of the alliance's 178 lawmakers, was opposed to G.K. Moopanar, leader of Finance Minister P. Chidambaram's Tamil Maanila Congress party.</p>
<p>Moopanar is a former member of the Congress party from the southern state of Tamil Nadu and is widely regarded as the Congress party's unstated choice to succeed Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>The United Front on Friday authorised southern Andhra Pradesh state Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu to name a new leader after consultations with the leaders of the 15-party coalition.</p>
<p>Among the northern Indian candidates are caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, caretaker Railway Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Bihar state Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, United Front officials said.</p>
<p>Left Front officials said there was growing consensus for Mulayam Singh Yadav as the new leader.</p>
<p>&quot;He would be our choice, but any other northern leader with a mass base will be a good candidate,&quot; one official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Mulayam Singh Yadav is a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state where the BJP recently formed a local government in alliance with a low-caste Hindu party.</p>
<p>Uttar Pradesh elects 85 lawmakers to the 545-seat lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Laloo Prasad Yadav is the chief minister of Bihar, India's second most populous state, which sends 54 deputies to parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Laloo appears to be a weak candidate because of the scandals surrounding his government,&quot; a United Front official said, referring to a federal police probe into a $285 million financial incident in Bihar.</p>
<p>Paswan belongs to the lowest Hindu caste, and has strong appeal compared with either the Congress or the BJP, a useful factor in looming polls, against two parties regarded as largely upper caste, officials said.</p>
<p>United Front sources said Naidu's choice of a leader, to be announced on Saturday, would be determined by two factors -- keeping the 15-party United Front together and preparing it for elections.</p>
<p>If Moopanar gets elected as the new leader, the Left Front will walk out of the United Front's decision-making Steering Committee, a senior Left Front official said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can't come to a decision, we will go to polls under Deve Gowda as caretaker prime minister,&quot; said a leader of the Communist Party of India-Marxist, a key constituent of the United Front.</p>
