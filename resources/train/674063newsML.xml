<p>Congo's new president, Laurent Kabila, has told some local officials to do as little as possible to aid a U.N. inivestigation into alleged refugee massacres by his troops, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Citing unnamed Western and Congolese sources, the Post said Kabila and other representatives of his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo gave the warning at an unusual meeting in the town of Bukavu last weekend.</p>
<p>They told government officials from Kivu Province, on Congo's eastern border with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, &quot;not to direct human rights investigators to any mass grave sites or potential witnesses,&quot; the Post said.</p>
<p>It cited its sources as saying Kabila and his new government were under intense pressure from Rwandan and Ugandan security officials to stymie the probe. Rwandan and Ugandan security forces formed an important part of Kabila's armed uprising against President Mobutu Sese Seko, who fled into exile on May 16.</p>
<p>In exchange for help in toppling Mobutu, Kabila was forced to give those units a free hand in gunning down thousands of ethnic Hutu refugees, who had been living in what was then Zaire since 1994, the sources were qutoed as saying.</p>
