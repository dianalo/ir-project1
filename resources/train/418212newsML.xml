<p>Milan fashion week is a hectic, heady time for &quot;Wonderbra Woman&quot; Eva Herzigova but the 23-year-old Czech supermodel says she still phones her parents to stop all the glamour going to her head.</p>
<p>Herzigova said in an interview at the autumn/winter 1997/98 designer shows on Tuesday that she is still close to friends from her teens in former communist Czechoslovakia but admits Eva on the catwalk and Eva at home are not always the same person.</p>
<p>&quot;When I go back I change. I'm not the Eva Herzigova that I am here. I change into this person I used to be back then to relate to my friends, to be more easily accessible,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The blonde supermodel, five feet 10.5 inches (1 metre 76 cm) with sparkling blue eyes, still loves to visit the Czech Republic seven years after her career took off by chance.</p>
<p>&quot;I always think my home is there. I do love to go back for a certain time. I didn't think of going back there forever -- you know, staying for the rest of my life, no. I've got used to the service of the Western countries,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Despite growing up in the drab Eastern bloc, where fashion magazines did not exist, she soon took to the glamour lifestyle.</p>
<p>&quot;When you're 17 years old you adapt to things very easily. We had a TV and I used to see things on TV. It was exciting but it wasn't a shock.&quot;</p>
<p>Herzigova, from Litvinov in the north of the Czech Republic, fell into fashion after a friend persuaded her to enter a modelling contest in Prague.</p>
<p>&quot;I was one of the first girls from the Eastern bloc and it was very exotic for the whole modelling business. I was lucky to start work right away. I was the right look at the right time.&quot;</p>
<p>Seven years on, she speaks fluent English and French as well as Czech and Russian and has pouted from magazine covers and advertising campaigns -- including flashing her kittenish smile in a series of flirtatious Wonderbra ads -- across the world.</p>
<p>But supermodel status can be tough. A media scuffle at the Cannes Film Festival left her shocked and scared.</p>
<p>&quot;People pushed and they were fighting. Cameras were all around. We got in the car and all people just smashed their faces against the windows and I couldn't see one bit of light.</p>
<p>&quot;It made me realise how much people idolise models and beauty and glamour,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Communicating with her family back in the Czech Republic helps keep things in perspective.</p>
<p>&quot;I always call my parents. You're head can grow so big in such a little time and talking to my parents makes me realise who I am, what I want and what I'm here for,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Herzigova has dabbled with a movie career, appearing in &quot;Les Anges Gardiens&quot; (Guardian Angels) with France's Gerard Depardieu, and says she would be interested in acting again.</p>
<p>But if that didn't work out Herzigova, who married the drummer of rock band Bon Jovi Tico Torres last September, said she wouldn't care. &quot;I'd just have a family,&quot; she said.</p>
