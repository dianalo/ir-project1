<p>The Atlantic City gambling market has a strong growth potential, but must make major improvements to lure new customers amid tough competition and industry consolidation, analysts and company leaders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I see Atlantic City has having growing revenues and high earnings,&quot; analyst Larry Klatzkin of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette told a Rutgers University gambling symposium.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see good things ahead.&quot;  </p>
<p>Oppenheimer analyst David Wolfe also said the city's gambling industry was moving toward the right goal, but added: &quot;I think it's going to be difficult to get there.&quot;</p>
<p>Major obstacles cited by speakers included a severe lack of hotel rooms and need for further infrastructure improvements, such as increased air service and a light rail link to connect the city's casinos with transportation hubs and a new convention center that opens Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Atlantic City does not need more casinos (and) does not need more casino operators. What Atlantic City needs is more hotel rooms,&quot; said Paul Rubeli, chairman of Aztar Corp, which owns the Tropicana casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The city now has about 10,500 rooms, about half of what is needed to accommodate demand from gamblers and the convention center, speakers said.</p>
<p>Rubeli said the lack of space forces casinos into hoarding rooms to give -- at no cost -- to regular customers and prevents them from operating the rooms profitably and keeps more customers from coming.  </p>
<p>Pending and anticipated projects could provide the needed rooms within about four years, Prudential Securities analyst Joseph Coccimiglio said.</p>
<p>The analysts and casino owners saw a period of consolidation in which larger companies with experienced management and multiple casinos would dominate growth and profitability as bigger and more spectacular attractions were built to lure customers.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is not a game in which everybody wins...what we're looking at in Las Vegas and possibly Atlantic City is an 'oligopoly of profit' developing,&quot; said Schroder Wertheim analyst John Rohs.</p>
<p>Boyd Gaming president Donald Snyder forecast an expansion of alliances within the industry and between casino operators and other companies, such as soft drink firms, restaurant chains and retail outlets that want to tap into casino crowds.  </p>
<p>Boyd announced Thursday it had applied for a casino license in New Jersey, as part of a planned joint venture with Mirage Restorts Inc, which is developing a tract of land at Atlantic City's marina along with Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;It (Boyd) will be part of a project that will redefine the marketplace,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rubeli said profitability of the city's casinos had been devastated in 1996 by a fierce war to attract customers amid expanded gambling capacity.</p>
<p>Heavy use of promotions drove down operating profit margins among the city's casinos to 19 percent from 25 percent the  year before, he said. He urged leading casino operators in the city to &quot;stop the giveaways,&quot; to restore profitability.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, whose Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc operates four casinos in the city, said that, despite the promotions battle, first quarter results of his casinos were strong.</p>
<p>&quot;Atlantic City is very volatile. Atlantic City goes up, fast and it stays there for a little while. It goes down fast and stays there for a little while. And it's going to go up again.&quot;</p>
