<p>Bombay stocks powered ahead on Monday with the broader market leading the rally and dealers expect the market to test all-time peaks this week on renewed demand from domestic and foreign funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The main factor is liquidity -- there's so much liquidity in the system,&quot; said Mayank Khemka, research head at brokers C. Mackertich &amp; Company.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) surged to 4,478.19 -- a new 34-month high on Monday, piercing 4,450 for the first time since September 30, 1994. The index added 117.62 points to close at a provisional 4,464.94.  </p>
<p>&quot;The 4,450 was a critical level and now that the market has broken through we can expect a further rise,&quot; Khemka said.</p>
<p>Much of the momentum for the rally came from local operators bidding for shares in anticipation of foreign fund demand, players said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the foreign funds are now turning their focus on dividend paying fundamentally strong small companies,&quot; said Vrajlal Dhank, a BSE member-broker. &quot;Retail investors are also buying in these stocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week the index jumped 157.51 points, or 3.76 percent, to 4,347.32. A sharp rise in index-heavyweight stocks which entered a no-delivery period from Monday also contributed to the index surge, market participants said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of speculative bidding taking place,&quot; said Kamal Kabra, former BSE president and member-broker.</p>
<p>He said much of the action was taking place in smaller capitalised stocks which showed volatile movement on account of the no-delivery period.</p>
<p>A no-delivery period occurs when a company closes its books and market players can buy or sell the company's stock without taking delivery of the shares.</p>
<p>Players get a longer time to close business during the period as against the usual weekly settlement.</p>
<p>Brokers said investor confidence had improved after many companies forecast a revival in business activity in the second half of 1997/98 (April-March).</p>
<p>&quot;The confidence level is improving. It appears that retail interest is coming back into the market,&quot; said BSE broker K.R. Choksey.</p>
<p>&quot;Stock markets always lead the economy. People are discounting good news that is expected to follow,&quot; Mackertich's Khemka added.</p>
