<p>Rural advertising controls in Britain will not be relaxed &quot;for the time being&quot;, Planning Minister Robert Jones said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;After consideration of the extensive public consultation exercise over the future of special controls...the Secretary of State has decided that they will remain for the time being,&quot; he told parliament.</p>
<p>Special advertisement controls were introduced to Britain in 1948 to prevent poster panels from flooding roadsides in rural areas.</p>
<p>Asked what measures Britain's Planning authorities would take in the future, Jones said they would be looking to see if there are sensible modifications that can be made to existing systems &quot;to provide the same protection of amenity with less bureaucracy&quot;.</p>
<p>Jones said the removal of the Areas of Special Control advertisements regime, canvassed in February, would not have created an &quot;open season&quot; on advertising in the countryside.</p>
<p>This was because local planning authorities already had widespread control over advertising.</p>
