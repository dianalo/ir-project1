<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Tuesday he was not concerned by his conservative government's falling popularity as it still held a strong lead over the Labor opposition.</p>
<p>Howard told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio all governments had peaks and troughs.  </p>
<p>&quot;You can't have an indefinite honeymoon in politics,&quot; Howard said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a very long honeymoon. We've obviously been criticised fairly in some cases, unfairly on others on a number of issues over the past few months, and it's inevitable that you will go through these peaks and troughs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The constant in all of the polls is that we're still comfortably ahead of Labor and any sort of temporary disenchantment people might feel with the coalition is not being translated into an increased vote for Labor.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Australian daily newspaper's Newspoll published on Tuesday showed a slump in support for John Howard and the Australian government.</p>
<p>A special analysis of the newspaper's Newspolls between April and June found voters were turning to minor parties such as Pauline Hanson's One Nation party rather than backing the Labor opposition.</p>
<p>Primary vote support for the coalition fell to 43 percent in the April to June period from 47 percent at the March 1996 election -- a level the government still held in January to March.  </p>
<p>Support for the Labor opposition dropped to 37 percent in April to June from 38.7 percent at the election and 38 percent in January and March.</p>
<p>But support for minor parties surged to a total of 20 percent from 14.3 percent at the March 1996 election and 15 percent in January to March.</p>
<p>The most popular of the minor parties was populist Pauline Hanson's One Nation party with six percent in the April to June period, followed by the Democrats and the Greens.</p>
