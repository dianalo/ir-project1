<title>UK: New meningitis scare hits Britain.</title>
<headline>New meningitis scare hits Britain.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A boy has died from meningitis and a girl from the same school has contracted the disease in the second such scare to hit Britain in as many weeks, health authorities said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old who attended Sale Grammar School in the northern England city of Manchester died less than a day after becoming ill.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old girl is also suffering from the disease and hospital officials described her condition as serious.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment there is no evidence the two cases are linked. However, we are assuming they are as a precaution for the time being,&quot; a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The more than 1,260 students at the school are being given antibiotics as a precaution.</p>
<p>Wales grappled with its own cluster of meningitis cases on a university campus in Cardiff. At least two people have died and hundreds have been vaccinated in an effort to contain the virus.</p>
<p>In Scotland, eight people have died and hundreds more are fighting a widespread food-poisoning outbreak.</p>
<p>A health authority spokeswoman said 78 people suspected of having the disease, including 64 confirmed cases, were still being treated. Three were listed in poor condition.</p>
<p>More than 290 people have reported symptoms in Lanarkshire county, the worst-hit area, since the outbreak first came to light after people ate tainted meat pies at a pensioners' lunch.</p>
