<headline>FORECAST - UK retail sales to bounce back in August.</headline>

<p>British retail sales will have bounced back strongly in August, after a surprise drop in July, unless a wealth of anecdotal evidence is completely wide of the mark, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of economists forecast a 0.5 percent jump in retail sales volumes in August, taking year-on-year growth up to 3.5 percent. In July, a shock 0.6 percent fall took the annual rate down to 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>Marian Bell, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said July's figures flew in the face of a variety of survey findings.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail sales growth fell back in July. This seemed to contradict survey evidence that retail sales growth remained strong,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, when the August figures are released, that circle should be squared she said, forecasting a 0.7 percent monthly rise in sales.</p>
<p>Bell noted the British Retail Consortium's August sales monitor showed retail sales rose 6.9 percent year-on-year on a value basis. Moreover, the Confederation of British Industry's August distributive trades survey showed the largest balance of firms reporting an increase in sales since 1988.</p>
<p>And weekly department store sales data from the John Lewis Partnership showed August sales up 18.5 percent on average from a year ago.</p>
<p>Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said July's sales could have dropped for any number of reasons -- the ending of Euro 96, the European football championships held in England, a spell of mild weather, or a reaction to the 1.4 percent leap in June's sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the cause, both the BRC and CBI surveys indicate that retail sales growth picked up again in August,&quot; he said. &quot;The buoyancy of recent notes in circulation data support this.&quot;</p>
<p>David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders, said the CBI survey indicated a particularly strong performance from furniture and carpet sales in August. &quot;But a relatively broad-based expansion in expenditure is likely.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the headline figure for July was disappointing but noted that even that month showed a firm underlying trend.</p>
<p>&quot;On a three-month-on-three-month basis, all sectors aside from food and non-store sales still reported an annualised increase in excess of five percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts at HSBC James Capel agreed. &quot;Given strength of sales in June, it is hardly surprising that volumes fell somewhat in July,&quot; they said. &quot;Retail sales, like most other economic series, do not go up in straight lines.&quot;</p>
<p>Their forecast matched the consensus for year-on-year sales growth of 3.5 percent in August. &quot;There is little doubt that the trend in retail sales volumes remains very firmly upwards,&quot; they said in a client note.</p>
