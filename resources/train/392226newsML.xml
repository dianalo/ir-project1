<title>MALAYSIA: Ringgit rangebound in thin, directionless trading.</title>
<headline>Ringgit rangebound in thin, directionless trading.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-02-20</dateline>

<p>The ringgit was rangebound in thin late Asian trading for want of fresh trading factors, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said the market was not sure of the ringgit's direction in the near-term, though in the medium-term and long-term sentiment was in favour of the Malaysian unit.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some consolidation, but most people are not sure of the direction,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>He said the 2.4820 to 2.4930 a dollar range was expected to hold in the near-term as demand for dollar was well matched by overseas demand for the ringgit.  </p>
<p>In the morning the ringgit recovered from a mild decline caused by dollar shortcovering and selling against Singapore dollar due to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's death.</p>
<p>&quot;There was ringgit/Sing selling in the morning on the back of Deng's death. But it did not last,&quot; said a dealer with a European bank in Singapore.</p>
<p>He said in a regional crisis people moved to a safe haven currency and Singapore dollar was the safest in the region. &quot;But the market has already discounted Deng's death,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.4857/67 a dollar. It was at 1.7407/26 Singapore dollar.</p>
