<headline>Jury begins deliberations in trial of ex-MGM chief.</headline>

<p>The jury began deliberating late on Tuesday in the criminal trial of former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc chief Giancarlo Parretti on charges that he altered evidence and testified falsely about it in a 1991 legal battle for control of the movie studio.</p>
<p>The charges were brought by the state of Delaware.</p>
<p>But in closing arguments, Parretti attorney Jay Coggan said the true prosecutor was not the state but Credit Lyonnais, the French-owned bank that loaned Parretti $1.3 billion to buy MGM in 1990.  </p>
<p>Coggan alleged that the bank paid the expenses from France of four of the state's main witnesses, hoping a conviction would discredit the Italian financier in his $3.9 billion conspiracy lawsuit against the bank, which is set for trial in Los Angeles in March.</p>
<p>&quot;There's an advantage to be gained in that matter. Don't let the bank get away with it,&quot; Coggan urged the jury.</p>
<p>In his rebuttal, Deputy Attorney-General Paul Wallace said Parretti &quot;knew his statement was false, he knew it was based on false evidence&quot; when he allegedly altered a letter of agreement to look as if it had been faxed to him.  </p>
<p>The bank claimed the agreement had been discarded as obsolete, but Parretti added a fax tag line to give the appearance that the bank sent it to him to confirm its promise that he could operate MGM until November 30, 1991, as long as he sold enough of its assets to reduce his bank indebtedness.</p>
<p>After the Chancery Court ruled in December 1991 that the bank had the right to oust Parretti, Credit Lyonnais took control of the board and sold MGM at auction to itself.</p>
<p>Credit Lyonnais recently signed an agreement to sell the movie studio to investor Kirk Kerkorian for $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>A unanimous decision is required by the jury of six men and six women, which will continue deliberations on Wednesday. If convicted, Parretti faces a maximum sentence of 10 years.</p>
