<p>Slovakia's real gross domestic product (GDP) should rise 5.3 to 6.7 percent in 1997 with inflation at 5.2 to 6.1 percent, the Prognostics Institute (PU) of the Slovak Academy of Science said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect GDP growth to be carried, as last year, by domestic demand,&quot; PU forecaster Pavol Karasz told journalists. &quot;(But) the estimated GDP growth will require a reasonable coordination between the monetary programme of the central bank and the state budget,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Real GDP growth was 7.0 percent in the first three quarters of 1996, while year-on-year inflation for the whole of 1996 slowed to 5.4 percent from 7.2 percent at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>However the continuous rise of the import burden on GDP was a serious factor resulting in the fragility of the country's economic growth, the PU outlook said.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic growth in 1997 must be linked to much lower dynamics in imports against 1996,&quot; Karasz said.</p>
<p>If the economy grows according to the PU forecasts, it would return, in real terms, to 95 percent of its level in 1989, the last year of communism.</p>
<p>PU researcher Juraj Rencko said inflation pressures from the growth of the money supply in 1995, had been succesfuly eliminated thanks to a well-coordinated monetary policy of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS), and government budget discipline.</p>
<p>&quot;But we can say that there are no more possibilities for further rapid decrease in inflation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation rate has been, and will remain, higher than the average level of developed European economies in coming years,&quot; he added.</p>
