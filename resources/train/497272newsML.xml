<p>French bond futures climbed for the third successive day as favourable signals from other bond markets, a techncially driven futures session and further talk of buying at the long end the curve, traders said.</p>
<p>The June contract trundled along in a narrow range until early afternoon when it finally managed to break through 128.46 and went onto test resistance at 128.76. The contract failed to climb further and succumbed to profit taking before the close.</p>
<p>A trader at a French bank said he was sceptical the rally was still being driven by short covering and that there was some foreign buying which in turn inspired some domestic investors.  </p>
<p>Another trader said the moves on Wednesday were largely technical and the oulook ahead of the Bank of France monetary policy council meeting on Thursday looked similar.</p>
<p>Iain Lindsay, senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said while the future was being helped by some interest in the cash market there was no great rebound in investor enthusiasm yet.</p>
<p>However, he said the trend among domestic investors appeared to be moving more in favour of long-dated bonds than the short end of the curve.</p>
<p>The yield curve flattened, the gap between two- and 30-year bonds narrowing four basis points.  </p>
<p>Another trader said there was some interest from overseas investors in long-dated principal strips.</p>
<p>Lindsay said investors appeared to be feeling a little more comfortable with the general European picture and more upbeat comments were expected from a meeting between French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>June PIBOR remained unmoved ahead of the Bank of France policy council meeting on Thursday. A third of economists polled by Reuters expected a small five basis point cut in the intervention rate with the rest forecasting unchanged rates.  </p>
<p>The strength of the franc was cited as the main justification by those expecting the central bank to trim rates on Thursday.</p>
<p>The franc was unchanged at 3.3648 against the mark after touching its highest level since June 1993 at 3.3627 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Call money was unchanged at 3-1/4 1/8 percent.</p>
