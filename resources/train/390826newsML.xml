<headline>Romania c.bank hopes 1997 leu fall below inflation.</headline>

<p>Romania's central bank governor Mugur Isarescu said on Thursday he hoped the leu currency would not fall faster than inflation this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the (fall) in the average exchange rate will be lower than inflation,&quot; Isarescu told a news conference. He estimated year-on-year inflation for 1997 at 89.5 percent, compared to 56.9 percent last year.</p>
<p>Isarescu declined to forecast a long-term level for the leu-dollar nominal rate. But he said the &quot;rate will from now on be set only by market forces.&quot;  </p>
<p>Earlier this week the BNR proceeded with liberalisation of the foreign exchange market by issuing dealer licences for 24 banks, which along with the existing four dealers act now as market makers.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market had been restricted to the four dealers since last March by the former leftist government.</p>
<p>Isarescu said the move would generate &quot;disorderly moves&quot; in the leu's exchange rates in the next few days. But the liberalised market would eventually eliminate large gaps between dealers and integrate prices.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a war of attrition but it will clearly subside,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Since the market was reopened to more dealers this week on Tuesday, the leu has lost some 18 percent against the dollar with operators saying it was trading at around 9,000 on the interbank market. The leu-dollar rate stood at 4,100/150 in the New Year.  </p>
<p>Isarescu said the BNR was determined to restore confidence in the leu by mopping up the excess money supply and creating a &quot;leu hunger&quot;. That, he said, would push interest rates up to positive levels in real terms and make the leu an attractive investment.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank is aiming for those who keep their leu to have substantial gains this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The money market was starved of leu funds and short-term rates surged to up to 160 percent from 52 earlier this year.</p>
<p>Traders said short-term rates would continue the rally as the central bank cut refinancing funds on offer at Thursday's auction to 520 billion lei from last week's 600 billion. -- Mirela Eremia, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
