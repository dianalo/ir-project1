<p>British Prime Minister John Major flew into Pakistan on Sunday, on what could be his last trip abroad before general elections, saying he was determined not to get involved in its troubled domestic politics.</p>
<p>Major arrives in Pakistan just four weeks away from its own elections to replace the National Assembly dissolved by President Farooq Leghari after dismissing Prime Minister Benazhir Bhutto in November on disputed charges of corruption.</p>
<p>Major told reporters on the plane taking him and a business delegation to Islamabad: &quot;I know political times are exciting in Pakistan, but neither (Trade Secretary) Ian (Lang) nor I intend to get involved in domestic Pakistani politics.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he would be showing this by holding talks with President Leghari, as well as with Bhutto and her main rival Nawaz Sharif, who have dominated Pakistani politics since the end of military rule in 1988.</p>
<p>But he said the elections should be free and fair with nobody excluded. &quot;We are expecting the elections to take place on the third of February. We think all the mainstream political figures will be candidates in that election,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to the return of a democratically elected government in Pakistan,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aides said he would make it clear he believed nobody should be kept out of the February poll, but he wanted to avoid becoming a pawn in the local election battle.</p>
<p>Major will question President Leghari on his plan to create a national security council, which gives the army its first formal advisory role in government since the death in 1988 of military ruler General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq.</p>
<p>Most political parties have reacted with hostility to the creation of the security council, which appears to mark a shift of power from the prime minister to the president.</p>
<p>But Leghari defended himself and his plans on Sunday, telling reporters working for foreign news organisations that a new elected government could do away with the national security council if it was felt to be unnecessary.</p>
<p>Major will not hold formal talks with cricketer turned politician Imran Khan, whose newly formed Tehreek-i-Insaaf (Justice Movement) party will be contesting the elections. But Imran has been invited, along with other political figures and businessmen, to a reception with Major on Monday night.</p>
<p>Major makes his final stopover in Lahore on Tuesday before returning to Britain and the battle to make inroads into the opposition Labour party's 20 point poll lead with elections due to be held in May at the latest.</p>
