<p>Croatian stocks were mixed on Tuesday as trade picked up and traders foresaw a proper market recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices have now stabilised after a recent dip and I expect the steady rise would continue throughout the week,&quot; Ivan Hren of Ceufin brokers told Reuters.</p>
<p>Of 15 active issues seven rose, five fell and three were flat. Volume rose to 9,405 units and turnover to 4.0 million kuna.</p>
<p>Food processor Podravka, ending a marginal 0.90 kuna higher at 317.90 kuna, took the spotlight with 4,692 shares sold.</p>
<p>It has been one of the most popular stocks over the past seven weeks, its price hitting 400 kuna at one point. Volume benefitted from a downward correction to the present level.</p>
<p>But Hren said the stock was now bound to recover, since the company managed to substitue a large part of its liabilities for cheaper foreign loans.</p>
<p>He added Podravka would also indirectly profit on government's protective farming policy.</p>
<p>Blue chip drugs firm Pliva remained flat at 480 kuna and 573 shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Fully listed Zagrebacka Banka lost 20 kuna to close at 1,830 on meagre volume of 51 shares. Its E-series preferred stock was more intensely traded with, gaining 10 kuna to 1,040, with 1,045 shares sold.</p>
<p>Hoteliers traded mixed with Laguna dipping 40 kuna to 1,400 on volume of 254 shares and Zlatni Rat gaining 90 kuna to 200 with 81 shares sold.</p>
