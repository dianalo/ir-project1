<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Solomon Lew backs Coles board changes.</title>
<headline>RTRS-Solomon Lew backs Coles board changes.</headline>
<dateline>MELBOURNE 1996-10-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Retailer Coles Myer Ltd's major shareholder, Solomon Lew, said he supported the abolition of his position of deputy chairman and other board changes announced on Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;I strongly support the decisions taken by the Coles Myer board today and announced by the chairman,&quot; Lew said in a statement issued on Friday night.</p>
<p>Coles announced that former paper baron Stan Wallis would become chairman from July 1997 and that it would invite Brierley Investments Ltd chief executive Paul Collins and Myer family representative Martyn Myer to join the board.</p>
<p>The embattled retailer said that given Wallis' appointment as chairman designate, there was no longer any need for either a deputy chairman or a vice chairman.  </p>
<p>&quot;Given the unusual circumstances of the board potentially having the positions of chairman, chairman designate, vice chairman and deputy chairman, I supported the elimination of the later two positions as they would be unnecessary in these circumstances,&quot; Lew said.</p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to working with my board colleagues to improve company performance and enhancing shareholder value,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lew was pressured to step down as executive chairman late last year after controversy erupted over a 1990 transaction between Coles and a company Lew was associated with.  </p>
<p>The so-called Yannon deal cost Coles A$18 million.</p>
<p>Parties to the dispute reached a settlement in August, resulting in a payment of A$12 million to Coles.</p>
