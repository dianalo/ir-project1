<title>UK: HSBC treasury performance strong in 96.</title>
<headline>HSBC treasury performance strong in 96.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-03</dateline>

<p>The Treasury performance at HSBC Holdings Plc was strong in 1996 with a boost coming from money-book management, Stephen Green, general manager group treasurer said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a satisfactory increase in our overall treasury performance with good profits coming in from money-book management,&quot; Green told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Settled conditions in the bond markets and increased customer-driven business kept treasury dealing profits across the group's commercial banking subsidiaries stable, HSBC, said in a statement after accompanying full-company results.</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings, one of the world's biggest banking groups, on Monday announced pre-tax profits for 1996 of 4.52 billion pounds ($7.3 billion), up 23 percent from 1995.</p>
<p>Dealing profits at HSBC holdings, which excluded net interest income attributable to dealing activities and dividend income on trading equities, slipped however by 18 million pounds to 515 million pounds in 1996.</p>
<p>HSBC's foreign exchange income at 354 million pounds was slightly down against 362 million in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Our business depends on a through-put of volume, it is a market (foreign exchange) that clearly did not grow very rapidly in the course of last year,&quot; Green told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the bank, however, was very pleased with the performance in foreign exchange and &quot;believes it continues to be a very good earner for us,&quot; Green told Reuters.</p>
<p>Green said foreign exchange volumes were stable in 1996 whereas in previous years they have seen quite dramatic growth.</p>
