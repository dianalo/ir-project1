<headline>North America bunkers gain from pre-holiday buying.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>North American bunker prices were mostly higher from those earlier this week, with the West Coast and Houston markets enjoying good inquiries ahead of next week's Christmas holiday, traders said.</p>
<p>Los Angeles 380 CST was offered at $126.00 a tonne, up $5 from Tuesday, with 180 CST pegged between $127 and $129, players said.</p>
<p>Seattle 380 CST jumped $2 to between $125 and $127, traders said. &quot;Singapore prices have been coming up and that's also helping us,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Traders said Houston 380 CST also jumped $2 to offers of about $110, with 180 CST pegged at about $115. &quot;The mid-week Christmas holiday is creting inquiries so things are inching up,&quot; one Gulf Coast player said.</p>
<p>Marine diesel in Houston moved $5 higher to between $219 and $225 a tonne, with traders attributing upward price pressure to a recent cold snap in the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>On the East Coast, meanwhile, New York Harbor 380 CST was stable at between $117 and $120, players said, although marine diesel oil firmed $3 to offers of about $245 a tonne.</p>
