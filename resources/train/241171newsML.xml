<p>Asian stock markets slumped on Friday after anti-inflation comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan triggered a flurry of selling across the region.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index posted its largest point fall since March, spiralling 388.83 points lower, a fall of 2.88 percent, to close at 13,102.73. Turnover was a massive HK$13.80 billion (US$1.07 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;The market was spooked by Greenspan's comments,&quot; said James Robertson, vice president at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong. &quot;There's not a buyer to be seen.&quot;</p>
<p>In a speech on Thursday, Greenspan said the Fed had to be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting stock and other asset markets.</p>
<p>He added that while inflation had been low recently, its future course was uncertain and the Fed had to be forward-looking in setting policy, taking action before dangers developed.</p>
<p>The speech sent shockwaves through Asian bourses, which saw it hinting at interest rate hikes to temper the recent euphoria in U.S. financial markets.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei average plunged 667.20 points to close 3.19 percent lower at 20,276.70 in its biggest one-day decline this year. Brokers said futures selling led the charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the Nikkei has hovered above 20,000 for some time, a break below that level would have an impact,&quot; a broker at a major Japanese securities house warned.</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur's Composite Index dived 33.62 points, or 2.74 percent, to 1,191.32, while Thai stocks were also swamped by the Asian selling wave, sliding 21.43 points, or 2.39 percent, to 876.89, its lowest close since June 1993.</p>
<p>Under pressure from selling in neighbouring markets, Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index buckled 23.78 points to close at 2,190.39.</p>
<p>Analysts said Greenspan's comments could cause a serious retracement on Wall Street when it opens on Friday, and Asian markets were trying to pre-empt any such correction.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan spoke after the American market closed so they are trying to double guess how far the American market is going to be down by,&quot; said Andrew Sekely, head of equities at Intersuisse in Australia.</p>
<p>Australia's All Ordinaries Index closed 69.4 points, or 2.91 percent, lower at 2,313.9, its single largest fall since March.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, where the NZSE-40 Capital Index shed 31.08 points to close 1.3 percent lower, brokers said Greenspan's speech had been interpreted as a warning that equities were overvalued.</p>
<p>&quot;This really is a very major sell-off,&quot; said one. &quot;This is anticipating the jitters on Wall Street, a severe case of the jitters.&quot;</p>
<p>Seoul's composite stock index fell below the psychological 700-point level to 699.89, but brokers said the drop was due to disappointment over a government plan to sell Korea Telecom shares and not to Greenspan's comments.</p>
