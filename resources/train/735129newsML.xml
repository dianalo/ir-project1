<p>Severe flooding which hit the eastern Czech Republic in the last two weeks caused damage worth an estimated 25 billion crowns to manufacturing industry, Industry and Trade Minister Karel Kuehnl said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In total, a very rough estimate is in the area of 25 billion crowns,&quot; Kuehnl said at a news briefing.</p>
<p>He said some eight billion was the direct damage caused by the flood wave, while other related losses from interruptions to production and sales could be worth 14 billion.</p>
<p>Kuehnl said that it was clear that the impact of the disaster on the economy would be negative.</p>
<p>But he said it was not clear yet how different factors, such as a fall in industrial sales and an acceleration in construction on the other hand, would add together.</p>
<p>Looses to the power and gas distribution sector were estimated at one billion crowns, Kuehnl said, a similar sum to looses in the mining sector. </p>
<p>Losses to the construction and trade sectors have not been calculated, but are expected to reach &quot;hundreds of millions&quot;, he added.</p>
<p>He said however the loss figure was not final as not all damage was yet known.</p>
<p>Kuehnl added that he expected only a small part of the destruction to be covered by insurance. Many companies had been under-insured, compared to the scale of the damage, as they had not thought such a disaster possible.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a catastrophe which only comes once in hunderds of years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kuehnl told the briefing that the floods hit 66 percent of the Czech steel milling industry, and about 50 percent of the engineering industry.</p>
<p>Gross estimates of the entire damage to the flooded area -- including damage to homes, crops, and businesses -- range from 50 to 100 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Agricultural Minister Josef Lux has estimated losses in the agricultural sector at 12 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Torrential rains in the north-eastern Czech Republic have forced tens of thousands to leave their homes and claimed at least 46 lives. Water swept away over 1,100 houses and damaged thousands of others, and cut road and rail transport in the region.</p>
<p>Meteorolgists have warned citizens another flood wave could be on its way as more heavy rain was expected at the end of this week.</p>
