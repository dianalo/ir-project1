<p>Mattel Inc. said Tuesday that despite a decline in its Fisher-Price infants' and children's toy business, it reported improved second-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The world's largest toymaker said second-quarter net income rose to $75.6 million, 25 cents per share, up from $63.4 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales for the quarter reached $972.7 million, up 6 percent from $921.6 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mattel said its Fisher-Price children's toy business was down in the second quarter, but its Sesame Street and Winnie the Pooh brands were strong.</p>
<p>Mattel Chief Executive Officer Jill Barad expects further progress in the second half as sales of Fisher-Price products begin to improve, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for our core brands continues to increase. Barbie, Hot Wheels and Matchbox are all experiencing double-digit growth,&quot; Barad said in a statement.</p>
<p>Total U.S. sales were up 10 percent for the quarter. Sales in international markets were up 1 percent in local currency, but were down 5 percent in U.S. dollars due to the impact of foreign exchange, Mattel said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're now achieving growth in most of our international markets, except for France and the U.K., both of which should rebound in the second half. We're seeing particularly strong performance in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, which were up 12 percent and 30 percent, respectively,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Mattel stock was up 75 cents at $34.50 in midday consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
