<p>U.S. rail container freight volume was at a record in the week ended July 26, the Association of American Railroads said Thursday.</p>
<p>AAR reported a total of 107,685 containers in the week, breaking the previous week's record of 106,058. Container volume last week was also up 6.6 percent from 101,053 reported in the year-ago week.</p>
<p>Total intermodal freight in the week stood at 175,051 trailers and containers, up 6.7 percent from 164,001 a year ago. Intermodal traffic does not include carloads.</p>
<p>AAR said carloads in the July 26 week stood at 348,441, down 1.2 percent from 352,746 in the same 1996 week, while ton-miles also declined 0.7 percent to 26.6 billion from 26.8 billion. The ton-mile, a measure of freight transportation, is one ton of freight hauled one mile.</p>
<p>Among carloads, AAR said metallic ores loadings posted the largest increase compared to the year-ago week, up 8.3 percent to 22,339 from 20,628, followed by motor vehicles and equipment, up 6.5 percent to 18,973 carloads from 17,807 last year.</p>
<p>Carloads of petroleum products increased 4.7 percent to 5,778 last week from 5,518 in the year-ago week. Grain mill products rose slightly, up 0.9 percent to 9,718 carloads from 9,633 a year ago. AAR said loadings of food and kindred products, chemicals, stone, and clay and glass were also up from the year-ago week.</p>
<p>But carloads of coke plunged 19.4 percent to 4,738 last week from 5,882 a year ago, while farm products other than grain fell 18.7 percent to 1,006 from 1,238.</p>
<p>Nonmetallic minerals carloads were down 7.9 percent to 9,487 from 10,302 a year ago, while coal loadings also declined 4.5 percent to 133,168 from 139,399, AAR said.</p>
<p>In the first 30 weeks of 1997, AAR said intermodal freight increased 7.2 percent to 4.89 million trailers and containers from 4.57 million in the same 1996 period. Ton-miles were up 1.8 percent to 787.4 billion from 773.5 billion, while carloads rose 1.3 percent to 10.17 million from 10.03 million in the period, it said.</p>
<p>Separately, AAR reported that U.S. carloads on the two Canada-based railroads had 51,698 carloads in the July 26 week, up 7.3 percent from the year-ago week, and 24,492 trailers and containers, up 8.8 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p>Combined U.S. carload volume in the United States and Canada-based railroads for the first 30 weeks of 1997 totaled 11.74 million, up 1.6 percent from the same 1996 period, and 5.62 million trailers and containers, up 7.7 percent from the year-ago period, AAR said.</p>
