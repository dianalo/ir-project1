<p>The Sino-British diplomatic body overseeing Hong Kong's reversion to China will meet one more time before the handover.</p>
<p>The Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which hammered out many of the details leading up to the British colony's return to China at midnight of June 30, will meet on Thursday through Friday next week in Hong Kong, the government said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A British source, however, stressed that next week's meeting would not spell the end of the JLG, the scene of many bitter disagreements over the capitalist city's future as a part of its vast communist motherland.</p>
<p>&quot;The JLG will be meeting until the year 2000, as laid out in the Joint Declaration,&quot; the source said. &quot;This (next meeting) will of course be the last before the handover.&quot;</p>
<p>On the agenda will be fairly technical legal issues such as details on the transfer of sentenced persons and procedures for reciprocal enforcement of judgements.</p>
<p>Some air service agreements between Hong Kong and other territories need to be endorsed, as will more details about the grand handover ceremony to be held on June 30, he said.</p>
<p>Also likely to be discussed is exactly what the JLG will be doing after the handover, the source said.</p>
<p>While the Joint Declaration, the accord under which Britian will give Hong Kong back to China, calls for meetings beyond the transfer, just how much weight the JLG will carry beyond that date remains uncertain.</p>
<p>While the JLG reached notable agreements on matters such as the establishment of a Court of Final Appeal, talks on other key issues such as electoral reform ended unresolved.</p>
