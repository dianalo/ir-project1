<p>U.S. municipal bond prices rose about 1/4 point Thursday morning after the August durable goods report dropped much more than expected, traders said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell 3.1 percent last month. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the figure would show only a 0.1 percent decline.</p>
<p>Analysts said the figure might lend credence to the idea that the economy is slowing on its own, supporting the Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday not to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>The Treasury market also registered its approval of the weak data.  </p>
<p>The long bond jumped more than 1/2 point following the number, moving the yield to 6.89 percent.</p>
<p>Among actively traded municipal bonds, yields on Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, Ill., AMBAC 5-1/4s of 2027 were down five basis points to 5.83 percent.</p>
<p>Texas Turnpike Authority FGIC 5-1/4s of 2023 were down six basis points to 5.70 percent.</p>
<p>But some market participants said they were leery of rallying off of one number.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're peeking through the 6.90 level, which seems to be very uncomfortable every time we get there,&quot; said Richard Visconti, head of muni trading at W.R. Lazard &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Visconti said the market will need to see a chain of several more market-friendly numbers if it hopes to maintain these levels.</p>
<p>Debt futures also rose off the durable goods number. The December municipal contract was up 18/32 to 114-16/32, and the December T-bond was up the same amount to 109-25/32. That left the MOB spread unchanged from Wednesday's close at 151 ticks.  </p>
<p>On the new issue calendar, Lehman Brothers said it tentatively priced $54 million California Housing Finance Agency bonds at a top yield of 6.20 percent in 2022.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co tentatively priced $44.9 million New York City Educational Construction Fund bonds at a top yield of 5.78 percent in 2026.</p>
<p>Fort Worth, Texas, plans Thursday's largest negotiated deal, an $87.2 million general obligation issue through senior manager Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Florida said it will sell the week's largest new issue Thursday, a $250 million competitive Board of Education issue at 1100 EDT.</p>
