<p>Tearful relatives of Oklahoma City bombing victims told how their hearts had been broken and lives torn apart as prosecutors called on Wednesday for the execution of convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like my heart looks like that building and has a huge hole that never can be mended,&quot; said a weeping Diane Leonard, whose husband, Secret Service agent Donald Leonard, was killed in the April 19, 1995, truck bombing that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like I died too on April 19,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Leonard was among the first witnesses called by prosecutors trying to convince a jury of seven men and five women that death was the only suitable punishment for McVeigh, who was found guilty on Monday of blowing up the building, killing 168 people in the worst attack on civilians on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>&quot;We will ask you to return a verdict of death, the only verdict that justly fits this crime,&quot; a solemn prosecutor Pat Ryan said during his opening statement in the penalty phase of the trial.</p>
<p>He said McVeigh, a 29-year-old Gulf War veteran, deserved to die because of seven aggravating factors, including his meticulous planning of the attack and because so many people were killed or maimed.</p>
<p>Relatives of bombing victims in court, journalists and several jurors wiped away tears as they listened to Wednesday's testimony, some of the most graphic and tragic of the trial.</p>
<p>McVeigh, who prosecutors say is a right-wing fanatic driven by hatred of the government, showed no emotion.</p>
<p>The same jury that found McVeigh guilty of 11 counts of conspiracy, bombing and murder must now decide whether he deserves the death penalty or life imprisonment.</p>
<p>The prosecution plans to call about 40 witnesses during the penalty phase, expected to last about a week. The defence will then call witnesses to try to show why McVeigh's life should be spared. Legal analysts say the defence faces a daunting task.</p>
<p>Grim-looking defence lawyers did not cross-examine the prosecution witnesses, who testified to the horror of the bombing and the permanent emotional and physical scars it left.</p>
<p>David Klaus, whose 29-year-old daughter Kimberly died in the blast, said he had suffered from depression, bronchitis, hepatitis and pneumonia and had lost weight since the bombing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been physically and emotionally just devastating for me. I've been in counselling but to this day I'm not dealing very well with this,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a huge hole in my heart that's never going to get filled up.&quot;</p>
<p>Mathilda Westberry, whose husband Robert was killed, said she had lost her best friend.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very, very lonely,&quot; she said. She said their grandchild, David, had had severe emotional problems since her husband's death. At school, David would sit with his hands over his ears because he was afraid his school would be blown up, she testified.</p>
<p>Several rescuers turned up the emotional intensity in the courtroom another notch.</p>
<p>Alan Prokop, an Oklahoma City police officer who was one of the first rescuers in the building, said a woman's hand protruding from the rubble clutched his hand. &quot;Then her hand got very still and started to get cold. I felt her wrist for a pulse and I found none,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prokop said one of the babies he carried out of the building was Brandon Denny. &quot;I cradled him in my arms and I noticed he had a head injury. He appeared to have a brick stuck out of his forehead,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jerry Flowers, an Oklahoma City police sergeant, told how rescuers heard a woman's faint cry but could not trace the source of it and it eventually went silent.</p>
<p>One woman, trapped with water rising to her neck, was screaming: &quot;Don't let me drown,&quot; he said. The water stopped rising just after it reached her chin, Flowers said, without saying what happened to her in the end.</p>
<p>Flowers said he took out one child whose &quot;face was gone.&quot;</p>
<p>Later, he worked in the second-floor day care centre where he saw toys and a baby's foot. &quot;It was a little girl, six months to 1-year-old. Just as we got her uncovered she was dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We pulled out five more babies,&quot; he said.</p>
