<p>Leading Russian shares drifted lower on light profit taking in early trade on Monday, but traders said low volume signalled investors could be waiting for prices to fall further before starting to buy again.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 22-share index opened off 0.05 percent at 421.25 after Friday's closing 421.46.</p>
<p>&quot;A rise is completely possible,&quot; said Aton trader Alexander Bobolev. &quot;But for now people are taking profits and everything will depend on how strong that trend will be.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares in Russia's biggest oil company LUKoil ticked down to $19.30 at 0915 GMT from Friday's closing $19.70, while regional power company Mosenergo eased to $1.400 from $1.415.</p>
<p>Metals producer Norilsk Nickel dipped to $9.55 from $9.60.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is a little lower but without any kind of aggressiveness,&quot; said Troika Dialog senior trader Alexei Dolgikh. &quot;There are no reasons for big sales now and so I think that by the end of the day the market will be a little higher.&quot;</p>
<p>But Prospekt's chief of corporate securities Andrei Ippolitov said any rise in the short term would be likely to be followed by a steeper market fall.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth, as a rule, happens in three stages -- we've already seen two and the third is shortlived but it should happen,&quot; Ippolitov said.</p>
<p>&quot;And then some time in July, (leading shares) will go down by about 30-40 percent.&quot;</p>
