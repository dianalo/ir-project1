<p>Former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler said on Friday the American people would react angrily to a tobacco company's admission that the industry marketed cigarettes to children.</p>
<p>&quot;For one of the major tobacco companies to admit that they marketed to children, that's striking,&quot; Kessler said on NBC's Today Show. &quot;I think it will make the average person just angry,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The admission by the Liggett Group Inc. -- makers of Chesterfield, L&amp;M and Lark cigarettes -- is a striking blow to the cigarette industry.</p>
<p>The admission came in a settlement of lawsuits on Thursday by attorneys general of 22 states who said Liggett confessed tobacco was addictive, caused cancer and that tobacco was marketed to minors.</p>
<p>The firm, the smallest of big tobacco companies, made the concessions to settle lawsuits by 22 states seeking to recoup money spent on health care for tobacco-related illnesses.</p>
<p>Liggett agreed to turn over documents to state judges that could prove crucial in lawsuits against other tobacco firms.</p>
<p>&quot;The industry has always maintained that smoking is an adult choice,&quot; Kessler said. &quot;Now one company has said it is addictive and they marketed an addictive product to children -- it is not a matter of choice, that settles that issue.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted that even Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole said during last year's campaign that cigarettes were not necessarily addictive. &quot;That has been the view of some -- that cannot be credible any more,&quot; Kessler said.</p>
<p>Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods said on the programme it was a signficant decision. &quot;This is the first time in the nation's history -- remember there are only five of them -- one of them has come forward and finally told the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that &quot;Most of us probably intuitively know they were not telling the truth -- at least now it's over, as far as this discussion because an insider, one of the tobacco companies has come forward and says smoking causes cancer, smoking causes heart disease and emphysema, nicotine is addictive and, yes, we have marketed towards children and the tobacco industry markets toward children.&quot;</p>
