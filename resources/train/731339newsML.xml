<title>USA: Champion Enterprises unfilled orders down.</title>
<headline>Champion Enterprises unfilled orders down.</headline>
<dateline>AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>Champion Enterprises Inc, which earlier reported lower earnings for the second quarter, said unfilled orders were $40 million versus $55 million in April and $110 million at this time last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Lower unfilled orders are a result of our higher capacity with incoming order rates down slightly from a year ago,&quot; said Walter Young, chairman and chief executive. &quot;We now have 53 facilities in operation compared with 46 last year.&quot;  </p>
<p>Champion earned $18.2 million, or $0.37 a share, in the second quarter, down from $19.1 million, or $0.39, in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Operating margins for manufactured housing fell to 6.8 percent from 7.5 percent in the second quarter of 1996 because of higher manufacturing costs related to lower levels of unfilled orders, the company said. In addition start-up costs for three new plants weighed on results in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Champion said cash flow from operations remained strong and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the six months was comparable to last year at about $62 million. The company still expected to meet its earnings goals.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain committed to our three-year goal of increasing earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 20 percent, using 1995's $1.14 as our base year. We believe the long-term growth prospects for manufactured housing continue to be positive,&quot; Young said.</p>
<p>Champion said it has repurchased about 1.67 million shares of its stock for about $26 million as of July 15 since the inception of a 2.5 million share buyback program announced in April.</p>
