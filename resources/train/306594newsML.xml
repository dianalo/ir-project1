<p>National Express Group Plc, the UK transport company, said on Tuesday that the departure of its chief executive Ernest Patterson was due to mutual differences over the group's style of management.</p>
<p>Colin Child, finance director, told Reuters in an interview that both parties agreed that &quot;he was not suited to National Express and National Express was not suited to him&quot; leading to the announcement of his resignation earlier. But Child stressed &quot;There was no dispute at all; no fight or debate or difference of opinion on commercial or strategic issues at all.&quot;  </p>
<p>The move surprised the market however, leading to National Express' share price sliding sharply. Shares are currently down four pence at 540, recovering from the initial steep fall-back of 17 1/2 pence to 526 1/2.</p>
<p>Child said that &quot;cultural style differences&quot; had emerged between the former chief and the transport group over recent months. Patterson joined National Express last August from BET Plc, the conglomerate where he was board director in charge of transport and logistics.</p>
<p>&quot;The style and approach of a big group with a smaller, rapidly growing group is very different,&quot; said Child.  </p>
<p>The finance chief said that National Express had a more devolved management structure than Patterson was used to.</p>
<p>He has been replaced with immediate effect by Phil White, formerly director of the West Midlands Travel unit.</p>
