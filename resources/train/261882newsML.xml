<p>France on Tuesday heaped praise on outgoing United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose reappointment was blocked by Washington.</p>
<p>Speaking on the day that Ghanaian Kofi Annan was to be formally appointed as his successor, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed &quot;the esteem and confidence that France has placed in Boutros-Ghali&quot; and praising his &quot;talent and competence&quot; during his five-year term.</p>
<p>&quot;He pursued U.N. reform with determination...and also preserved the organisation's ability to pursue peace and development even as he helped it to adapt to new challenges requiring global responses and the united and determined action of all member states,&quot; the spokesman said, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;For this, we thank him&quot;.</p>
<p>The ministry spokesman also had kind words for Annan, the head of U.N. peacekeeping whose appointment initially was opposed by Paris, calling him &quot;a man whose experience and wisdom are recognised by all&quot;.</p>
<p>Annan &quot;will need the support of all member states&quot; to carry out his mission, the spokesman said, adding that France fully backed him in those efforts.</p>
<p>Annan begins his five-year term as secretary-general on January 1.</p>
