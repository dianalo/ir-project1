<p>North America's top funeral home operator, Service Corp. International, made an unsolicited, $2.8 billion bid Tuesday for its No. 2 rival, Canada's Loewen Group Inc.</p>
<p>Loewen, whose stock rose sharply on U.S. and Canadian markets after Service Corp. proposed a stock swap valuing Loewen at $43 a share, said in a terse statement that its board would review the bid.</p>
<p>Houston-based Service Corp., which built its empire in North America and Europe by buying small rivals, took Wall Street by surprise with its bid, which would would pay Loewen stockholders $2.8 billion for their shares.</p>
<p>Service Corp. also would assume $1.3 billion in debt, for a total pricetag of $4.1 billion, sources said.</p>
<p>Service Corp. said it might raise its bid, which was based on public information, after reviewing Loewen's confidential information.</p>
<p>&quot;This proposal will create a combined company with unparalleled resources,&quot; Service Corp. Chief Executive Robert Waltrip said in a statement.</p>
<p>The offer was made in a letter to Loewen Chief Executive Raymond Loewen after Service Corp. failed to get a response to repeated calls to his office starting Sept. 11, Service Corp. said.</p>
<p>But analysts said Service Corp. will face a tough fight acquiring Loewen. One analyst said Loewen has already called an emergency board meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no love lost between Ray Loewen and Bob Waltrip... It is not likely that Loewen is going to simply roll over. This is a hostile tender offer,&quot; said Chicago Corp. analyst Steve Saltzman.</p>
<p>A takeover could face several roadblocks.</p>
<p>A combination needs the approval of 75 percent of voting Loewen holders. With a 15 percent stake owned Raymond Loewen and insiders holding an additional 3 percent, this could prove difficult. Loewen also has a so-called &quot;poison pill&quot; takeover defence which would be triggered if Service Corp. acquired 20 percent or more of its stock.</p>
<p>If completed, the merger would result in a company operating about 3,750 funeral homes and 600 cemeteries around the world, said Service Corp., which operated 2,832 funeral homes, 331 cemeteries and 146 crematoria as of June 30.</p>
<p>The market was sceptical about the deal. Loewen's stock soared $6.25 to $40 on the Nasdaq system, but stayed below the $43 a share bid. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Loewen gained C$8.45 to C$54.95 ($40.10).</p>
<p>Service Corp. fell 12.5 cents to $30.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Loewen's stock has clawed its way back up in value after a nearly disastrous lawsuit in Mississippi brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. The stock price fell from a high last year of $41.75 to as low as $16.375.</p>
<p>Loewen seemed to turn the corner in May, saying it had already completed $305 million in acquisitions and signed deals for another $196 million.</p>
<p>Analysts played down potential antitrust concerns, saying the industry was too fragmented for regulators to block the deal, although some divestitures would be expected.</p>
<p>&quot;The combined entity would still only have 16 to 17 percent of domestic market number of funeral homes,&quot; said Lynn Detrick, an analyst for Williams MacKay Jordan &amp; Co. Inc.</p>
<p>Service Corp.'s traditional focus on metropolitan areas and Loewen's strategy in rural areas would mean less overlap.</p>
<p>Both companies have been buying privately owned funeral homes in the United States and Canada. In June, Loewen teamed up with investment bank Blackstone Group to buy Prime Succession Inc., the largest privately held funeral home operator in the United States, for $295 million.</p>
