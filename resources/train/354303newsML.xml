<p>Sprint Corp said Tuesday start-up costs for personal communications services (PCS) will continue to pressure net earnings in 1997 and 1998, but the company remains confident in the wireless phone business.</p>
<p>&quot;The start-up costs will cause pressure on earnings, and those will actually peak in 1998,&quot; Ronald LeMay, president and chief operating officer, said in an interview.  </p>
<p>Sprint PCS, a joint venture including Sprint, Tele-Communications Inc, Cox Communications Inc and Comcast Corp, launched a wireless phone service in eight markets in 1996 and plans to launch the remaining markets by the end of the year, he said.</p>
<p>The venture won the rights to 65 major markets in a U.S. Federal Communications Commission auction of the wireless licenses, and Sprint said it alone acquired licenses as well in a recent auction for 139 additional markets.</p>
<p>Sprint PCS cost the company about $0.10 a share in 1996's fourth quarter.  </p>
<p>At least one analyst cut his earnings estimate for 1998 because of the expected increase in dilution from the buildout of Sprint's territories following the auctions.</p>
<p>LeMay declined to comment on rumors that Sprint has considered buying a larger stake in the Sprint PCS venture from its other partners.  It currently owns 40 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts have said it is a possibility in the long term, as start-up costs begin to slow.</p>
<p>&quot;We have said repeatedly that we like the business very much,&quot; LeMay said of PCS.  &quot;We're very confident in those businesses and they're very strategic to Sprint.&quot;  </p>
<p>And analysts said investors see PCS as a key business for the company.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that by mid-year Sprint is going to trade on the subscriber growth in PCS,&quot; said Michael Elling, an analyst for Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>Earlier, Sprint reported fourth quarter net earnings of $0.57 a share including a litigation charge versus a net loss of $0.98 reflecting restructuring expenses.  Operating income from continuing operations, before charges and ventures, rose to $347 million from $290 million.</p>
<p>Sprint has been quick to point out that despite the pressure on net earnings associated with new ventures, its core businesses continue to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;The way I would summarize it is we have extremely strong momentum,&quot; LeMay said.</p>
<p>And Wall Street seems to agree.  Despite the fourth quarter results coming in slightly lower than overall expectations because of the new investments and start-up costs, Sprint stock traded up 3/4 at 41.</p>
<p>&quot;The core business was an absolute blow-out,&quot; Elling said.</p>
