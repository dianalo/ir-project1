<p>Perceptron Inc said Tuesday it expects first quarter net income for it alone to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.14 a share -- before an expected $0.04 a share reduction in earnings due to its recent acquisition of Autospect Inc.</p>
<p>A year ago, Perceptron earned $0.12 a share after a $0.04 a share compensation charge.</p>
<p>Perceptron also said its new order bookings for the first quarter were $17.7 million, more than double the $8.7 million for the comparable period last year.  The bookings for both periods include Autospect.  </p>
<p>At March 31, backlog stood at a record $28 million, Perceptron said.</p>
<p>Bookings for the first quarter include two new first-tier supplier orders totaling approximately $2.2 million. In addition, a new second quarter order was received by the company's South Korean office for a major automotive system, totaling about $600,000.</p>
<p>Commenting on first quarter results, the company said consolidated results for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.10 per share, compared with $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>The company said it expects Autospect to be accretive to earnings for the year.</p>
<p>It added that revenues for the combined companies of Perceptron and Autospect are expected to be about $10.2 million, a record for a first quarter.  Combined revenues for the comparable prior year period were $9.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;...(B)ased upon the current outlook, we expect the second quarter of 1997 to show a marked improvement over the first quarter, as well as over the second quarter of 1996,&quot; Alfred Pease, chairman, said in a statement. &quot;In addition, we would expect the continued strong demand for our products to be reflected in our 1997 results.&quot;</p>
