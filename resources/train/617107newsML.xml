<p>Wheat in northwest Kansas received needed rains over the long holiday weekend while cool temperatures also aided the state's hard red winter wheat crop, meteorologists said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are starting to improve the moisture conditions in northwest Kansas just as the crop is getting into the main heading period of development,&quot; said Mike Palmerino, senior agricultural meteorologist for Weather Services Corp.</p>
<p>He noted that wheat's main moisture needs were during the heading stage so the rains were very timely.  </p>
<p>Palmerino said temperatures in Kansas were also below normal and should remain cool at least until Friday, allowing fall tillers damaged by a freeze earlier this year to continue to recover and spring tillers to develop.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they could have looked for a much better weather pattern than they have seen since the freeze with the exception of the dryness in northwestern Kansas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>WSC's Palmerino said western Kansas received a total of 0.50 to 1.00 inch of rain over the three-day period.</p>
<p>Fred Gesser, chief forecaster for Weather Express Inc, estimated rainfall in Kansas at 0.50 to 2.00 inches.  </p>
<p>He also projected below-normal temperatures up to Friday, although by Saturday, they should be near normal levels.</p>
<p>Gesser said most of the Corn Belt also received widespread rain of at least 0.50 inch over the long weekend. Temperatures were forecast to be below normal early in the week but warming up by Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;(Corn) farmers would have to be relatively pleased with what they see at the moment. The moisture appears to be there,&quot; WSC's Palmerino said.</p>
<p>He noted, however, there was some concern that cool weather was delaying crop development.</p>
<p>Gesser, of Weather Express, said his six- to 10-day outlook for the U.S. Corn Belt suggested that both temperatures and precipitation would be normal.</p>
<p>WSC's Palmerino said in upper Midwest states such as Michigan, there was some concern that delays in emergence caused by cool, wet weather, could result in some seed rotting in the soil.</p>
