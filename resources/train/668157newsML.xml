<p>China said on Tuesday it had expressed serious concern and dissatisfaction to Washington over a visit to the United States by the foreign minister of rival Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese side has made solemn representations with the U.S. side over the U.S. visit of Taiwan's so-called Foreign Minister John Chang to express the Chinese side's serious concern and dissatisfaction,&quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since the Communists won the Chinese civil war and sent Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops fleeing into exile on the island in 1949.</p>
<p>Chang, a grandson of Chiang Kai-shek, is visiting the United States. Chang bears his mother's surname.</p>
<p>Cui said Washington should restrict ties with the island to an unofficial level.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese side has asked the U.S. side to...abide by its promise to restrict U.S.-Taiwan relations to an unofficial arena,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always been opposed to the United States and Taiwan engaging in any form of official contact,&quot; Cui said.</p>
<p>Washington switched diplomatic relations to Beijing from Taipei in 1979. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.</p>
<p>Cui urged the United States to &quot;take concrete action to eliminate disruption of Sino-U.S. ties by the Taiwan question&quot;.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. relations went into a tailspin after the United States granted a visa to Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui for a private visit to attend a Cornell University class reunion in June 1995.</p>
<p>In Washington, the State Department said on Monday Chang was on a private visit, a &quot;normal element&quot; in unofficial ties with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Apparently to placate China, the State Department emphasised that Chang was not scheduled to come to Washington.</p>
<p>During his nine-day visit, Chang was to speak at a world affairs conference in Los Angeles and attend a forum in Beaver Brook, Colorado, arranged by the private American Enterprise Institute, Taiwanese officials said.</p>
<p>The visit comes at a sensitive time, two weeks before China resumes control over the British colony of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on a plan by Taiwan's military to conduct military exercises June 23-24 ahead of the handover, Cui urged &quot;Taiwan authorities to do more things that would be conducive to relations between the two sides and reunification&quot;.</p>
<p>China hopes Hong Kong's return will serve as a model for Taiwan's eventual reunification with the communist-ruled mainland.</p>
<p>Taiwan has rejected the Hong Kong formula and says it is committed to reunification, but under democracy and a free market economy.</p>
<p>China has threatened to invade if Taiwan declares independence. The island denies any separatist dreams.</p>
<p>Cui declined to comment on a Hong Kong newspaper report that China planned to respond to Taiwan's war games with its own military exercises this month.</p>
