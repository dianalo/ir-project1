<p>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co, a unit of Morgan Stanely Group Inc, said Monday it has withdrawn from some Massachusetts municipal bond work because a senior official with the firm made a contribution to Massachusetts Gov. William Weld's U.S. Senate campaign that may trigger a political contribution regulation.</p>
<p>The firm said in a one-page statement that it has withdrawn from any municipal securities business with Massachusetts and state authorities while the National Association of Securities Dealers reviews its request for a &quot;waiver&quot; from the rule's penalties in this instance.  </p>
<p>Enacted by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board in April 1994, rule G-37 bars municipal dealers that make contributions to issuer clients from doing business for two years with those governments.</p>
<p>Dealers must keep records of contributions and report quarterly to the board.  The next round of quarterly reports are due from firms on October 31.</p>
<p>The MSRB has stated in guidelines to municipal firms that the rule covers contributions to state and local issuer officials running for federal office.  </p>
<p>A Morgan Stanley spokesperson said, &quot;During preparation of the firm's quarterly filing, it was discovered that a senior fixed income managing director had, without the firm's knowledge, made a political contribution in early September to the U.S. Senate campaign of Massachusetts Governor William Weld,&quot; Morgan Stanley said.</p>
<p>The contributor assumed that contributions to federal, as opposed to state and local, political campaigns were not covered by rule G-37 or firm policies concerning the rule, Morgan Stanley said.  </p>
<p>The firm said it has asked NASD for a waiver from rule G-37 in connection with the $1,000 contribution. The contribution &quot;has been fully refunded to the contributor by the Weld campaign,&quot; the firm added.  The firm's statement did not say who made the contribution.  The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the gift was made by Peter Karches, head of Morgan Stanely's fixed-income department.</p>
<p>Morgan said until NASD decides on the waiver question, the firm &quot;has voluntarily chose to withdraw from any municipal securities business&quot; with the state and any Massachusetts &quot;entities that could be construed to be subject to Rule G-37.&quot;</p>
<p>Morgan said the firm's legal department notified federal regulators about the contribution on the day it was discovered.</p>
<p>Morgan said the muni official reported the contribution on an internal quarterly reporting form.</p>
