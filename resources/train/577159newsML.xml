<p>Italy's chances of joining Europe's single currency in 1999 were cast into doubt on Monday when Rome's European Union partners found it falling short in efforts to get its economy in order.</p>
<p>EU finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, approved a sharply worded report on the state of Italy's finances, suggesting that many of the measures taken to cut the budget deficit were not sustainable.</p>
<p>Rome played down the report, pledging to meet criteria for the single currency.</p>
<p>The ministers' view on Italy contrasted sharply with their findings for other countries -- notably Spain and Portugal -- whose efforts to catch up with the EU's northern economies were praised in separate reports.</p>
<p>Germany was also applauded for taking deficit-cutting measures viewed by ministers as sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p>Ministers approved nine reports in all as part of the EU's so-called excessive deficit procedure in which countries seen running high budget deficits are urged to take action.</p>
<p>Finland and the Netherlands were taken off the list, joining Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark. Britain's report was delayed, pending a budget from the new Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was attending his first EU finance ministers meeting.</p>
<p>Brown signalled a fresh start with his EU partners and said he would work constructively on the single currency.</p>
<p>In their report on Italy, ministers said spending controls in 1996 had been &quot;insufficient&quot;, temporary deficit cuts taken in 1997 must be replaced by permanent ones, and that steps were needed in 1998 to lessen the risk of future red ink.</p>
<p>&quot;The measures taken in 1997 which have a temporary nature should be replaced by structural measures with a permanent impact on the budget,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Italy has successfully lowered its budget deficit to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio this year to near the three percent required for economic and monetary union (EMU) by adopting certain one-off measures, notably a so-called Euro tax.</p>
<p>Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi, denying that a duel was shaping up between Rome and Brussels over Italy's chances for EMU, said Italy was working on a new finance programme updating its efforts.</p>
<p>He said it would show Italy aiming for a 1998 deficit to GDP ratio of below three percent, as recommended by the ministers.</p>
<p>Last month, Italy fumed at a European Commission forecast showing it missing the deficit criteria this year and facing a swelling gap in 1998.</p>
<p>Spain and Portugal, meanwhile, appeared to improve their EMU credentials. Once considered rank outsiders for the first-wave of EMU membership, both were praised for their efforts at structural reform and budget consolidation.</p>
