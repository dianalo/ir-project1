<p>The Philippine shares index fell through a support in early Friday trade as investors sold blue chips and focused on thirdliner issues, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;When a correction comes in sight as it did yesterday, the last thing people want to do is to be caught in the middle so they pull back,&quot; said Juanis Barredo, analyst at Citisecurities Inc.</p>
<p>The main index fell below the 2,650 support, losing 26.84 points, or 1.01 percent, to 2,643.17 points in early trade.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are no fresh funds in the market and even though there are good earnings results, investors are still taking in the news. Investors who are in the market are putting their money in the speculatives,&quot; said Chemarie Cheng, analyst at Dharmala Securities.</p>
<p>Among heavily-traded early gainers were tertiary issues Republic Resources and Development Co and Liberty Telecommunications Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>Blue chip Ayala Land Inc was among the most actively traded losers, shedding 50 centavos to 20.75 pesos in early trade.  </p>
<p>&quot;The plays really are on the speculatives. There are still too many uncertainties and I guess the sole evidence is that there's no significant money coming in to the market,&quot; said David de la Cruz, vice-president for marketing at Amsteel Securities.</p>
<p>The market barometer fell further by 29.57 points, or 1.11 percent, to 2,640.44 points thirty minutes into the session.</p>
