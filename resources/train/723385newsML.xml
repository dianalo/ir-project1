<p>Spanish police launched a manhunt for a kidnapped politician on Friday, racing against a Saturday deadline when the Basque guerrilla group ETA threatened to kill him unless their demands were met.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope I am wrong but I fear that ETA will try to carry out its threat,&quot; Basque government head Jose Antonio Ardanza said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>Hundreds of police and Civil Guard troops combed the Basque and Navarre regions in search of Miguel Angel Blanco, a local official from the ruling Popular Party, Interior Ministry sources said.</p>
<p>Blanco, 29, a Basque town councillor, was abducted on Thursday shortly after leaving his home in Ermua on the way to catch a train to work.</p>
<p>Authorities said the separatist group had vowed to execute him unless about 500 ETA inmates held in prisons throughout Spain were transferred by 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Saturday to institutions closer to the Basque region.</p>
<p>The government dismissed the demand, saying it would not succumb to blackmail or change prisoner policy in the face of a threat from a &quot;band of terrorists.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We find ourselves faced with duress, a threat and blackmail, although this is not a simple challenge to the government but a challenge to society,&quot; Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told reporters on Thursday night.</p>
<p>At their weekly meeting, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and his cabinet considered what further action might be needed.</p>
<p>Basque politicians convened an emergency session of the region's Ajuria Enea, a permanent forum created to seek peace and reconciliation. It unites all regional political parties except ETA's political wing Herri Batasuna.</p>
<p>Blanco was last seen on Thursday afternoon after having lunch with his parents.</p>
<p>A short time later, a caller who identified himself as an ETA member contacted Radio Egin, ETA's usual mouthpiece, to say Blanco would be killed in 48 hours if the government did not move Basque prisoners closer to their homeland.</p>
<p>Blanco was probably targeted because he was a member of the ruling party but, as a low-level official, was not protected by bodyguards, authorities said.</p>
<p>ETA has been pushing the government to move jailed members to prisons in the Basque region. Many Basque nationalist leaders who staunchly oppose ETA have also pressed for a prisoner transfer.</p>
<p>Under a long-standing government policy, the inmates are scattered in small groups around the country.</p>
<p>Spanish newspapers said this was the third time ETA had set a deadline to kill a kidnap victim. In the previous cases, both hostages were killed.</p>
<p>About 800 people have died in ETA's 29-year struggle for an independent Basque homeland.</p>
<p>The latest kidnapping tempered the euphoria that followed the release of two ETA hostages last week. The separatists released kidnapped businessman Cosme Delclaux on July 1 after his family paid the captors $6.85 million.</p>
<p>Hours later, a Civil Guard unit rescued prison worker Jose Antonio Ortega Lara, who had been held for 532 days.</p>
<p>&quot;This (new) kidnapping is a clear act of retaliation. It is an act of terrible cowardice and unjustifiable duress,&quot; said Carlos Iturgaiz, Popular Party president in the Basque region.</p>
<p>Iturgaiz and other political leaders called for mass public demonstrations on Friday. The blue ribbons which symbolise opposition to the ETA kidnappings reappeared on newspaper front pages and public buildings on Friday.</p>
