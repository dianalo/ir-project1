<p>Widespread monsoon rains and the availability of stocks with state agencies will put cotton prices under pressure in coming days, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said the arrival of the four-month June-September monsoon after a marginal delay had covered the cotton tracts across the country.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 percent of India's 9.0 million hectares of area under cotton depends on these annual rains for its growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The rainfall is normal. We expect the area under cotton to remain the same,&quot; said a leading cotton trader. &quot;As of now, weather conditions are conducive to cotton crop.&quot;</p>
<p>A national conference of cotton traders had recently estimated the 1996/97 (October/September) crop at a record 16.78 million bales (one bale is 170 kg), up from 16.27 million in the previous season.</p>
<p>Traders said more than 95 percent of the current season's crop had already been marketed, with substantial quantities procured by state agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;There's enough cotton available in the market,&quot; said another trader, adding that state agencies would start selling stocks over the next three months before the new crop came to market in October.</p>
<p>Cotton prices suffered a setback in the week to Thursday after firming initially, traders said.</p>
<p>Fresh buying by spinning mills exporting cotton yarn pushed prices up but the widespread monsoons in cotton tracts had pulled prices down, they said.</p>
<p>In spot, Bengal-deshi lost 10/20 rupees to 1,020/1,050 rupees per maund (37.32 kg) and Punjab saw-ginned 20 rupees to 1,825/1,880 rupees per maund. Punjab F-414 shed 10 rupees to 2,050/2,080 rupees per maund.</p>
<p>Timely and widespread rains had triggered selling by traders, said Mahesh Thakkar, a cotton trader.</p>
<p>Gujarat Kalyan fell 100/300 rupees to 13,900/14,200 rupees per candy (355.56 kg) and Wagad cotton lost 300 rupees to 12,600/12,700 rupees per candy.</p>
<p>Thakkar said the market's anticipation of further cotton exports did not materialise.</p>
<p>He said the state-owned agencies which bought cotton from farmers were holding huge stocks and were demanding more cotton for export.</p>
<p>&quot;These agencies may sell their stocks in the domestic market in the coming days, which could result in a further fall in cotton prices,&quot; Thakkar said.</p>
