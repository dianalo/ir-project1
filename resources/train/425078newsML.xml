<p>Western Australia was entering into a new phase of downstream processing and value-added industries, the state's Governor Major-General Michael Jeffery, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Officially opening the first session of the state's 35th parliament, Jeffery said agreements under negotiation, which would need parliamentary ratification, included the Kingstream Resources NL -An Feng Steel Co Ltd midwest integrated steel project near Geraldton with a possible new port at Oakajee at a projected overall cost of A$2.4 billion.  </p>
<p>A uranium mining and processing project by the RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd group at Kintyre in the Pilbara area was also under negotiations, he said.</p>
<p>Another key objective was be the setting up of a petrochemical project in the same region, he said.</p>
<p>German interest has been expressed in the petrochemical which is at early stages of planning.</p>
<p>The government has said it intends calling for expressions of interest later this year.</p>
<p>They also included Australian United Steel Industry Ltd's A$1.5 billion direct reduced iron plant near Wickham in the Pilbara, he said.</p>
<p>A  A$1.8 billion iron ore enrichment plant by private group Mineralergy in the Fortescue area and a A$750 million Mt Gibson iron ore project were also the subject of negotiation, he said.</p>
<p>The projects would bring added value with almost 9,000 new jobs during the construction phase and almost 2,000 permanent jobs when production begins. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
