<p>Shares in Hungarian pharmaceuticals company Egis Gyogyszergyar Rt opened sharply lower on Monday, hit by bearish market sentiment and first-half earnings that showed a fall in profits and weaker domestic sales.</p>
<p>Egis opened at 12,790 forints, down from Friday's close of 13,200 forints. At 1040 GMT the shares traded at 12,300 forints, down 900 forints or 6.82 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This price reflects primarily the market's sentiment, which is characterised by profit-taking and by some panic,&quot; said Peter Tolgyesi, trader at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz. &quot;Of course, Egis's price also reflects its earnings.&quot;</p>
<p>The whole Budapest Stock Exchange moved sharply lower on Monday, after setting successive highs early last week. The BUX index opened at 8,039.51 points and at 1040 GMT it traded at 7,926.95 points, down 420.57 points or 5.04 percent.</p>
<p>Spencer Jakab, analyst at CS First Boston in Budapest, said Egis's exports were excellent but domestic sales were disappointing.</p>
<p>&quot;(Egis's) export performance was excellent, up roughly 26 percent in dollar terms to the CIS alone,&quot; Jakab said.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic performance was fairly disappointing, worse even than I would say pessimistic expectations.&quot;</p>
<p>Egis, majority-owned by France's Servier S.A., reported its after-tax profits fell to 3.033 billion forints ($15.3 million) in the first six months of 1997 from 3.314 billion in the first half of 1996 while its net sales rose to 13.593 billion from 12.529 billion.</p>
<p>Domestic sales fell to 6.422 billion forints from 7.289 billion, while exports grew 7.171 billion forints from 5.240 billion.</p>
<p>Egis's exports amounted to $40.6 million in the first half of 1997, representing a rise of 13 percent in dollar terms over exports in the first half of the previous year. Exports to CIS countries and exports of active ingredients grew the fastest, by 26 percent and 23 percent, respectively, in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Jakab said that Egis's margins deteriorated due to lower sales of high-margin cardiovascular generics in Hungary and sharply increased spending on sales and marketing.</p>
<p>The fact that Egis boosted sales in bulk chemicals by 23 percent in dollar terms was good in itself, but since bulk chemicals are low-margin products, they also weighed down on margins, he added.</p>
<p>Jakab said he expected Egis to show substantially better performance in the coming up to two years.</p>
<p>&quot;They are spending wisely on sales and marketing regionwide,&quot; he said. &quot;I would expect a dramatically improved performance from the company in one and a half to two years' time.&quot;</p>
