<p>Former Afghan prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar will discuss the situation in Afghanistan with ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani in a few days, he said in remarks published in Tehran on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hekmatyar, interviewed by Iran News, said his Hezb-i-Islami organisation which has been fighting the Islamic Taleban that now rules most of Afghanistan was still active and had a comprehensive plan for a significant role in Afghan affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to talk to Ustad Rabbani in a few days focusing on various aspects of the Afghan situation,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Hekmatyar predicted the Taleban, which seized the capital Kabul in September, would fail to capture the whole of the country by force and called for a permanent ceasefire and general elections.</p>
<p>Iran News, an English-language daily which often reflects the view of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, did not say where the interview took place.</p>
<p>The Taleban has frequently accused Iran of supporting forces loyal to Rabbani. On Monday it ordered the Iranian embassy in Kabul closed for alleged involvement in espionage and said Tehran's diplomats should leave within 48 hours. It said Iran was not neutral in the Afghan conflict.</p>
<p>Iran's Foreign Ministry denied the charges and said the embassy had been kept open for humanitarian purposes.</p>
<p>The Islamic republic has refused to recognise the Taleban government and continues to recognise Rabbani, who fled the Afghan capital when Taleban forces captured it. Shi'ite Moslem Iran has accused the Sunni Taleban of giving Islam a bad name by its harsh interpretation of sharia law.</p>
