<headline>Turkey c.bank starts T/N money trade at interbank.</headline>
<dateline>ISTANBUL 1996-12-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Turkish central bank started on Thursday to trade with &quot;tomorrow next value&quot; (T/N) on its screen-based money market, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking into account the recent market conditions, the bank will start from December 5, 1996 to give bid and offer rates for T/N money trading at the interbank. That will increase depth in the market and help banks plan their cash flows,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will give our bid and offer rates for T/N, but the market will decide whether to trade or not,&quot; a central bank official said.</p>
<p>The bank set its tomorrow next bid and offer rates at 59-76 percent on Thursday when it also lowered its overnight offer rate to 78 percent from 80 on Wednesday. The bank raised its overnight bid rate to 57 percent from 55, narrowing the margin between its bid and offer rates.</p>
<p>The first T/N trading was priced at 76 percent in the interbank.</p>
<p>The central bank announced bid and offer rates for forward transcations with a maturity of up to three months in the interbank in 1994 when a financial crisis hit markets.</p>
<p>It later stopped to quote forward rates as markets centered on overnight trading amid uncertainties in the Turkish economy. --Tulin Aygunes 0212-275 08 75 ATA</p>
