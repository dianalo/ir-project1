<p>Argentine blue chips clawed back into positive territory at the close Friday on short-covering, but the broad index lagged behind, still hurt by a selloff on U.S. markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;New York gave us a fright today but it was a good opportunity for business here,&quot; said Nestor de Cessare of traders Allaria Ledesma.</p>
<p>He said the trend was likely to remain volatile next week ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index recovered from a floor of 836.47 to close up 0.1 percent at 850.73.  </p>
<p>The MerVal, which had closed at a five-year high of 857 Wednesday, mustered gains of 1.2 percent on the week.</p>
<p>&quot;The drop in U.S. bonds was linked to the swings in the dollar currency and the effect the dollar's woes had on the Treasury's refunding effort,&quot; De Cessare said.</p>
<p>&quot;We could see some more erratic movements in the long bond yield in the next few days, but locally I'd say this is just a temporary downward correction.&quot;</p>
<p>The broad market index recouped some losses but closed off 0.7 percent, with losers outstripping winners 33 to 19 and 12 issues closing flat.</p>
