<p>May Day opposition rallies across Russia are expected to call for the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin, who has unexpectedly returned to Moscow from a holiday on the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said Yeltsin had decided to cut short his holiday at the resort of Sochi because of bad weather and denied that the 66-year-old leader, who had heart bypass surgery last November and pneumonia in January, was ill again.</p>
<p>On arrival, Yeltsin was met at the airport by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who briefed him on the recent flare-up in violence around the breakaway south Russian region of Chechnya and other issues, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The situation around Chechnya, where 21 months of war between Moscow troops and rebels ended in a shaky truce in August, has deteriorated badly in the past week.</p>
<p>Bombs in two towns, a few hundred km (miles) from Sochi, killed at least four and injured dozens. A senior official of a region bordering Chechnya was shot dead on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, who has taken a tough line on Chechnya, said after briefing Yeltsin on Wednesday that police were taking steps to reinforce security in southern Russia but were not planning to send any fresh troops.</p>
<p>An emergency meeting in the war-shattered Chechen capital, Grozny, between Russian Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin and Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov produced a joint call for Yeltsin and Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov to meet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Russia and Chechnya agreed a cease-fire last summer after 21 months of war in which tens of thousands were killed, but talks on a political and economic settlement have since stalled.</p>
<p>Maskhadov said he was ready for direct talks with Yeltsin &quot;any time, any place,&quot; Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>But the more immediate problem for Yeltsin will come on Thursday, the official holiday of Spring and Labour, known in the Soviet era as the Day of International Solidarity of Workers.</p>
<p>The president is due to deliver a radio address at 11 a.m. (0700 GMT).</p>
<p>Communist-led opposition and unions plan rallies in Moscow and other cities which will mark the start of their fresh campaign aimed at ousting Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said earlier this week his party would start collecting signatures with demands of Yeltsin's resignation. Such petitions will have no legal force.</p>
<p>Another communist slogan would be &quot;No To NATO Expansion&quot;, Zyuganov said. Both the communists and Yeltsin oppose NATO's plans to extend invitations to several former Moscow allies at a summit in July.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives in Moscow on Thursday for talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.</p>
<p>Primakov said on Wednesday after a meeting with U.S. Under-secretary of State Strobe Talbott Moscow still hoped to sign a deal on a new partnership with NATO on May 27 as envisaged by Yeltsin, but again opposed any military build-up in any new members of the alliance.</p>
<p>Officials said Yeltsin had no plans to meet Albright.</p>
<p>A Kremlin spokesman in Moscow said Yeltsin would return to his Gorky-9 residence, west of the capital on Wednesday evening.</p>
