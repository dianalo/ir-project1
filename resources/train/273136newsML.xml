<p>The volume of residential mortgage loans in Hong Kong continued to grow rapidly in November, confirming a recovery in property market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said on Monday.</p>
<p>The HKMA said total outstanding mortgage lending by the 33 institutions in the survey rose 1.8 percent on the month to HK$319.9 billion, against October's 2.0 percent increase.</p>
<p>The growth rate remained higher than the monthly average of 1.5 percent over the last twelve months, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>New loans approved during the month was the highest since the survey was first conducted in December, 1992, but it was offset by a corresponding increase in the amount of repayments which rose by 18.2 percent to HK$11.2 billion, HKMA said.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures reflect the revival of refinancing of existing mortgages as well as demand for new mortgages arising from the continued buoyant residential property market in October,&quot; HKMA acting deputy chief executive Raymond Li said.</p>
<p>The annualised rate of growth in lending over the last three months increased to 20.1 percent from 14.7 percent in the three-month period to October, while the twelve-month average of outstanding loans showed an annualised increase of 17.6 percent from October's 17.0 percent, it said.</p>
<p>Lending for purchase of properties in China increased by 1.1 percent to HK$6.0 billion in November.</p>
