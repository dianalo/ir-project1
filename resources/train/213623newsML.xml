<title>UK: Cold oil markets shrug off bearish Iraqi news.</title>
<headline>Cold oil markets shrug off bearish Iraqi news.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Oil prices fell on Monday on news that Iraq might soon export crude again, although cold weather and expectations that OPEC will freeze its current ceiling prevented a massive selloff, traders said.</p>
<p>Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Baghdad had agreed to all U.N. conditions that had held up implementation of a $2 billion &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal and predicted oil could start flowing some time in December.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said later he did not see any problem with Iraq's pricing formula, one of the obstacles which had delayed implementation of the deal.</p>
<p>Brent crude, the world benchmark, slumped 40 cents a barrel on the news but then staged a partial recovery. Brent for January loading was down 25 cents a barrel at $22.78 at 1643 GMT but above the low hit immediately after the news of $22.66.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is bound to fall on this type of news, but it is still focused on winter and heating oil demand,&quot; said Alistair Harris of brokers MeesPierson Derivatives in London.</p>
<p>The oil-for-food deal signed in May has been on hold for months. It was ready to go ahead in September, but was delayed when Iraq sent its troops into the north of the country in late August to back one side in an inter-Kurdish conflict.</p>
<p>The United Nations said at the time security conditions in the region did not permit the deployment of U.N. staff to monitor the deal. The United Nations and Iraq have also been at odds over demands by Baghdad to control the number and make-up of the U.N. monitoring team.</p>
<p>Iraq's Hamdoon said on Monday: &quot;All the aspects of the MOU (memorandum of understanding) have been discussed and they have been agreed upon,&quot; adding this included the issue of U.N. observers.</p>
<p>Hamdoon also said a pipeline leading from northern Iraq to Turkey, through which most of the oil is due to pass, &quot;will definitely be ready by the first week of December&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If the pricing formula is approved -- which we hope to get this week -- then nothing else remains,&quot; he said. He was referring to action by the U.N. Security Council's sanctions committee, which must approve a formula governing oil sales contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;December, I think, is the most likely time for the oil to start moving, because there is nothing else to impede the process,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OPEC ministers converged on Vienna on Monday for talks later this week expected to freeze current output quotas to try to extend this year's rally in world oil prices.</p>
<p>Ali Nuaimi, oil minister of OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia, has yet to reach Vienna but delegates from some other member states predicted a consensus on extending existing quotas to mid-1997. Gulf sources suggest the Saudis also doubt if the market is strong enough yet to warrant turning up the taps.</p>
<p>OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria expressed satisfaction at a rally that has already lifted prices to the highest since the 1991 Gulf War. An average of almost $20 per barrel so far this year is up $3 from 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It's cold but I hope it gets colder&quot;, Lukman told lobby reporters, observing that an early winter in the United States and Europe is firing up demand for fuel.</p>
<p>One reason for the tighter market is that new supply from non-OPEC sellers hasn't built up as fast as oil firms, who were content to operate with low stocks, had predicted. And there has been the delay implementing a food-for-oil accord to ease the U.N.</p>
<p>The higher prices add up to a windfall extra $30 billion in revenues for the 11 OPEC members whose economies were under pressure in recent years when oil languished in the bargain basement.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, for instance, which produces a third of all OPEC oil, can expect $10 billion of excess to deal with a projected 1996 deficit of almost $5 billion.</p>
<p>Given that it needs the money and that the bonanza may not last long, especially if Iraqi exports are allowed to resume in 1997, analysts doubt if Saudi Arabia is keen to raise production now and risk accelerating a likely decline in prices.</p>
<p>The Saudis' attitude is crucial because they are almost alone, with Gulf allies Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, in having any appreciable unused production capacity.</p>
<p>Whilst the Saudis honoured an OPEC-mandated quota of 8.0 million barrels per day - they have 2.0 million in mothballs - most others are at capacity and several are violating quotas.</p>
<p>Quotas have not been officially raised since 1993, except for some extra volume pencilled in for Iraq. Yet even without this Iraqi oil, actual OPEC daily supply this year is about a million barrels above an agreed ceiling of 25.03 million.</p>
<p>Oil analysts say that if Saudi Arabia raised its output now on top of the cheating the price would almost certainly drop.</p>
