<headline>Russia's Gazprom resumes normal Belarus supplies.</headline>

<p>Russia's Gazprom natural gas monopoly has resumed regular deliveries to Belarus after cutting them last week when the former Soviet republic failed to pay its bills, a Belarussian government official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Yuri Melnikov, chief of the energy resources department, told Reuters that deliveries resumed after Belarus partially paid its bill and established a future payment schedule.</p>
<p>Supplies were reduced by seven million cubic metres of gas per day.</p>
<p>The country of 10 million people normally receives 47 million cubic metres of gas daily. Belarus imports 16 billion cubic metres of Russian gas annually.</p>
<p>&quot;Gazprom has been paid $10 million. Despite all the difficulties the government located the means to find the money,&quot; said Nikolai Mochernyuk, president of the state company Beltransgaz, in a television interview on Sunday night.</p>
<p>He said that if Belarus failed to make promised payments, supplies would be reduced anew.</p>
<p>Mochernyuk has said previously that Belarus's debt to Gazprom was $204 million.</p>
<p>Belarus also owes Russia $50 million for past supplies and annually receives 10 million tonnes of oil for domestic needs and six million tonnes to refine for Russia at its two plants.</p>
