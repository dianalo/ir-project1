<p>Daimler-Benz AG expects U.S. sales to make up 25 percent of total revenue within the next five years, up from 20 percent at present, chief executive Juergen Schrempp said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Group revenues were 106 billion marks last year, and Schrempp told a news conference at a reception celebrating 100 years of Daimler's presence in the United States that he expected sales to rise to around 125 billion marks over the next five years. He gave no figures for U.S. future sales.  </p>
<p>He said that Daimler expected investment of some $500 million in the United States in that period and highlighted strong growth in sales of Mercedes cars as an indication that the company was doing well.</p>
<p>Company officials said the $500 million of investment would be additional to investment of some $300 million in a new Alabama plant making sports utility vehicles and investment in its newly acquired Freightliner heavy truck unit.</p>
<p>Freightliner has already announced plans to expand output and boost employment at its North Carolina plants.  </p>
<p>The vehicles being built in Alabama would be American cars, built to Daimler's quality standards, Schrempp added.</p>
<p>&quot;We are producing for the first time Mercedes cars outside Germany,&quot; he said. &quot;We have come to the United States because...we think we have to produce close to the market. The American consumer will see that this is a quality vehicle of Daimler-Benz/Mercedes standard.&quot;</p>
<p>Schrempp said Daimler had not yet decided whether to offer its new A-Class compact car for sale in the U.S. market, but said European demand for the vehicle was exceeding expectations.</p>
