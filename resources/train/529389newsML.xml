<title>USA: Continental drops cargo fuel surcharge.</title>

<p>Continental Airlines said it dropped its cargo fuel surcharge on all routes with effect Monday April 21, thereby following the lead set by most of the airline industry in removing the extra charge, its Cargo marketing manager Dana Bates told Reuters.</p>
<p>Continental had been one of the few still retaining the 10-cent a kilo surcharge, put into place by the world's airlines last fall after a sharp spike in global fuel prices.</p>
<p>Now, with prices moderating, a large majority of airlines have pulled their surcharges.</p>
<p>Continental had said until a few days ago that it wasn't ready to drop the levy because its fuel costs still were well above year-ago levels.</p>
<p>The principal region where the surcharges have survived is on U.S.-Asia routes over the Pacific, where a number of leading carriers, including American Airlines and Northwest Airlines as well as the Japanese airlines, still charge it.</p>
<p>Continental, a significant bellyhold freight carrier between U.S. and Japan, joins United Airlines and both major Canadian carriers in rescinding transpacific surcharges.</p>
<p>Last week in London Continental said it was dropping its transatlantic surcharges ex-UK and ex-Germany from April 12. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017</p>
