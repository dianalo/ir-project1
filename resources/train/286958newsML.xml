<p>Czech President Vaclav Havel married actress Dagmar Veskrnova in a private ceremony on Saturday, his office confirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;The (civil) wedding was performed in the absence of public and media at the Municipality of Prague 3. Only two witnesses... and Mrs. Veskrnova's daughter were present,&quot; an official statement said.</p>
<p>Veskrnova, 44, is a popular TV, theatre and film actress with a full-time job in one of Prague's leading theatres. She has been divorced since 1980 and has a 20-year-old daughter from her first marriage.</p>
<p>Havel, 60, a former dissident playwright who became president after the overthrow of communism in 1989, is a widower. His wife Olga died of cancer last January after 32 years of marriage.</p>
<p>In his traditional New Year's speech he spoke of Olga, to whom he wrote numerous letters from jail that were published as a book in the West, as hid &quot;closest human being&quot;.</p>
<p>Havel left hospital late last month several weeks after an operation to remove a malignant tumour from his lungs. He contracted pneumonia soon afterwards and had to be connected to a respirator. Doctors say his condition has been improving steadily.</p>
