<p>Advance Bank Australia Ltd said on Tuesday that it was not aware of the National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) buying its shares in recent active trading.</p>
<p>&quot;No, we are not aware of NAB having bought our shares,&quot; an Advance spokesman said. There has been speculation that NAB has been buying Advance shares in order to try to block the A$2.65 billion takeover of Advance by St George Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>The Advance spokesman said he could not comment on who could be involved in recent active trading of Advance shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;I believe the St George offer for all Advance Bank ordinary shares is a full value offer and that our shares at the moment are trading below that full value offer and therefore, as always, Advance Bank shares are a good buy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There has also been speculation that NAB, which is the largest shareholder in St George with a 7.8 percent stake, would seek legal means to disrupt the proposed merger to be put to shareholder meetings on December 23 and January 13.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that what we are doing is in all respects legal and we are proceeding as publicly stated (with the proposal),&quot; the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>A NAB spokesman said bank did not as a matter of policy comment on speculation or rumour and would not comment on whether NAB was buying Advance shares or pursuing legal means to disrupt the merger.</p>
<p>Asked whether there were potential legal means, he said: &quot;We would not make a comment about that either from a strategic point of view.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for St George also declined to comment on the reports, other than to say the distribution of the merger scheme booklet and its contents had been approved by the court.  </p>
<p>&quot;Obviously we believe we are in a very good position and we are moving forward to the shareholders' meetings,&quot; he said.</p>
