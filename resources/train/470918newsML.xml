<p>Japanese investigators on Wednesday raided the offices of a real estate firm linked to a racketeer at the centre of a scandal involving Nomura Securities Co Ltd, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kunihiro Matsuo told reporters.</p>
<p>He said prosecutors and officials from the nation's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, went to the office in Tokyo of Kojin Building Co, a firm owned by a relative of a &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeer.</p>
<p>Matsu said there was a possibility of another round of raids on the offices of Nomura, which were raided on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>He said 80 investigators, including 55 prosecutors, went to Kojin's office, and the raid was still taking place.</p>
<p>He said depending on the contents of what had been seized in Tuesday's raids, there might be a further raid on the offices of Nomura.  </p>
<p>The headquarters of Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage, and several other locations were raided on Tuesday. Matsuo told reporters on Tuesday the raids were to investigate a Nomura director's illegal payment of 38 million yen to a company run by a relative of a racketeer to avoid disruption of a Nomura annual meeting.</p>
<p>The scandal surfaced on March 6 and two directors resigned on March 10 after internal probes found they made discretionary deals banned under Japanese law and funnelled profits to a front company for the racketeer.</p>
<p>Sokaiya, often linked to &quot;yakuza&quot; crime syndicates, extort money by threatening to expose dubious business practices or to disturb shareholders' meetings -- called &quot;sokai&quot; in Japanese.</p>
