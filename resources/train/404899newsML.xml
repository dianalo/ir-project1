<p>State-run Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) has sought the government's approval to raise $150 million in foreign borrowings in 1997/98 (April-March), the Railway Board's chairman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have...asked for $150 million in external commercial borrowings,&quot; M.K. Kaw told a news conference held after Railways Minister Ram Vilas Paswan presented the railway budget for 1997/98 to parliament.</p>
<p>However, the government's approval would depend on the borrowing needs of other infrastructure sectors like telecommunications, Kaw said.</p>
<p>Paswan said the IRFC would raise 21.5 billion rupees ($600 million) from the domestic and foreign markets in 1997/98, compared with an estimated 18.5 billion in 1996/97, of which 15 billion rupees have already been raised.</p>
<p>Of the amount expected to be raised in the domestic market, five billion rupees were expected to come from tax-free bonds, the same amount as in 1996/97, Kaw said.</p>
<p>Kaw said market borrowings were usually not considered conducive for railway projects since they involved a public utility that did not have profit as its sole motive.</p>
<p>IRFC enjoyed a good credit rating which was helpful but the government was keen not to increase its borrowing liablilities, Kaw said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our credit rating is high...but the difficulty is that we cannot come under a debt trap,&quot; he said.</p>
