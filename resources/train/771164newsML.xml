<title>SINGAPORE: Singapore rubber market buoyed by brisk buying.</title>

<text>
<p>The Singapore rubber trade finished on an upbeat note on Thursday on the back of modest shortcovering by local brokers and a few consumers in the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of fairly extensive shortcovering by local brokers in the market. Most of the overseas buys were not in but the buying was across the board and steady,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bridgestone was said to have asked for some quotes today. I believe they bought some TSR20 rubber for forward delivery,&quot; another dealer said.  </p>
<p>Traders said the market may become quiet again on Friday ahead of an industry meeting in Indonesia. Lingering concerns over the region's currency problems may also drive market players to the sidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the people have left for Indonesia. With the end of the week coming up, it should be quiet,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>At 0945 GMT, October RSS3 was seen at 97.50 U.S. cents a kg from 98.50 cents. January/March RSS1 was seen at 154.75 Singapore cents (US$1.05 cents) a kg from 156.00 cents. October TSR20 was seen at 99.75 U.S. cents a kg from 100.75 cents.</p>
