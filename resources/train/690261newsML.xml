<headline>Lira increase takes EIB euro Eurobond to $2.5 bln.</headline>

<p>The European Investment Bank on Thursday raised the size of its benchmark euro Eurobond to $2.5 billion by adding 250 billion lire to a recent Eurolira deal, according to Reuters data.</p>
<p>The deal, due February 15, 2007, is comprised of Eurobonds in five European Union currencies, all of which will be redenominated into euros after EMU. At current rates the deals total 2.17 billion Ecu, or $2.47 billion.</p>
<p>The EIB has pioneered fungible euro-redenominatable debt, a concept with two key aims. One is to create large, liquid benchmark issues for the market post-EMU, the other to broaden investor awareness ahead of EMU.</p>
<p>Rene Karsenti, director general of finance at the European Investment Bank, told bankers at a conference last week that it would launch more euro-tributary transactions.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the EIB extended its euro yield curve out to 12 years with the launch of a redenominatable French franc funding. Earlier this year, it issued an Ecu bond with a seven-year maturity.</p>
<p>Euro-tributary, or parallel, bonds, are bonds launched in more than one currency but with the same coupon and maturity date. They contain clauses which allow for their redenomination into euros after EMU.</p>
<p>The third stage of European economic and monetary union, including the introduction of the European Union's planned single currency, the euro, is prescribed by EU law to take place no later than January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>From that date, all national currencies within the euro area will cease to exist legally, but will instead be expressions of the euro.</p>
<p>The bonds making up the EIB's 2007 deal are:</p>
<p>    Currency   Amount	Ecu value   Z-code</p>
<p>    Escudo     20.0 bln    101 million	ZWFU</p>
<p>    Franc	3.0 bln     453 million	ZVCM</p>
<p>    Guilder    1.0 bln     453 million	ZTVE</p>
<p>    Lira	 1.25 trln   653 million	ZYMW</p>
<p>    Mark	 1.0 bln     510 million	ZWNQ</p>
<p>		   Total     2.170 bln ($2.47 bln)</p>
<p>All the bonds carry 5.75 percent coupons, with the exception of the lira deal which will pay 9.00 percent until the 1999 coupon date.</p>
<p>This higher initial coupon was used to overcome a tax problem. The level of Italian interest rates would have meant pricing a 5.75 percent lira deal at a large discount to par, creating a taxable capital gain for Italian investors.</p>
<p>Today's increase took the size of the lira leg, launched Tuesday, to 1.25 trillion lire. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Credito Italiano and Paribas were joint lead managers.</p>
