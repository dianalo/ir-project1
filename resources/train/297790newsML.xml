<p>An Australian navy frigate headed home on Thursday with two round-the-world yachtsmen safely aboard after a dramatic double rescue in icy seas near Antarctica.</p>
<p>Frenchman Thierry Dubois was plucked from a life raft by helicopter at first light and hours later British solo sailor Tony Bullimore swam into the arms of rescuers after five days beneath his upturned yacht.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment I feel ecstatic,&quot; Bullimore told BBC radio from the frigate HMAS Adelaide after treatment for hypothermia and dehydration.</p>
<p>The former Royal Marine said he owed his life to &quot;sheer determination, a little water, a little chocolate: hanging in there and believing something would happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Frigate commander Raydon Gates said earlier a &quot;feeling of elation&quot; ran through the ship when Bullimore responded to knocks on the hull of his yacht, confirming for the first time since capsizing on Sunday that he was alive.</p>
<p>&quot;He got out of the yacht himself and appeared just beside the bow of the yacht bobbing away in the waves,&quot; Gates told Reuters from the frigate more than 2,500 km (1,500 miles) from the Australian coast.</p>
<p>&quot;Miracle is the word that pops to mind,&quot; Gates added.</p>
<p>The successful four-day hunt for the two yachtsmen brought tributes for Australia's maritime services and messages of thanks from France and Britain.</p>
<p>Holidaying Australian Prime Minister John Howard added his congratulations for the double rescue, which followed an operation to save French solo yachtsman Raphael Dinelli from his sinking yacht a day after Christmas.</p>
<p>Defence minister Ian McLachlan said the government was not counting the cost of the rescue missions, but Sport Minister Warwick Smith has written to French counterpart Guy Drut to say the race should be moved to a more northerly and safer route.</p>
<p>The two sailors were competing in the Vendee Globe round-the-world yacht race, which has justified its reputation as one of the world's most dangerous sporting events.</p>
<p>HMAS Adelaide's commander Gates, while delighted at the successful outcome of his mission, also said more thought should be put into the risks of around-the-world yacht racing.</p>
<p>&quot;The only reason we're doing this is because these people are racing so far south and I think the wisdom of that would have to be questioned,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gates said 56-year-old Bullimore was &quot;remarkably fit&quot; given his ordeal. Described as a tough former Royal Marine, he was being treated by the ship's doctor for hypothermia and was dehydrated having run out of water two days before his rescue.</p>
<p>He said Bullimore had suffered possible frostbite on his feet and had lost the tip of a finger in an accident.</p>
<p>Dubois, who spent a day clinging to the hull of his upturned yacht before taking to a life raft dropped from the air, was also in surprisingly good health.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Frenchman was plucked by helicopter from the raft in a &quot;copybook&quot; operation at first light on Thursday after an earlier rescue attempt had been postponed due to bad weather.</p>
<p>Gates said the yachtsman suffered slight hypothermia and had sores on his hands and feet from water exposure.</p>
<p>&quot;His first word was 'Thanks',&quot; Gates said. &quot;He did very little talking but a lot of smiling.&quot;</p>
<p>Another competitor, Canada's Gerry Roufs, was said on Wednesday to have lost radio contact with race organisers.</p>
<p>Australian Maritime Safety Authority manager search and rescue operations Rick Burleigh said Australia would not be involved in any search for Roufs, who was in Chilean waters.</p>
<p>Members of Bullimore's relieved family plan to fly to Australia to greet him when the frigate returns to Perth on Sunday.</p>
<p>Gates said Bullimore greeted his rescuers in typically British style. &quot;His first words were 'Thank God' and 'It's a miracle' and when when we got him back on board the ship he said he wouldn't mind a cup of tea,&quot; he said.</p>
