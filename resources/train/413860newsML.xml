<title>USA: U.S. corporate bonds dull amid Treasury weakness.</title>
<headline>U.S. corporate bonds dull amid Treasury weakness.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Trading in the U.S. corporate bond markets was sluggish on Monday as continued weakness in the Treasury market sidelined many investors, traders said.</p>
<p>Spreads on high-grade bonds were unchanged on very light trading, traders said.</p>
<p>High-yield investors were also put off by a drop in the stock market in the morning, traders said.</p>
<p>While stocks recovered to finish the day higher, junk bonds trading was light and bond prices dropped by 1/4 of a point on average, they noted.  </p>
<p>Most action in Monday's markets focused on the bonds of individual companies that made significant announcements or were the focus of media coverage.</p>
<p>Long Island Power and Lighting Co debt tightend by five to 15 basis points on news that the Long Island Power Authority may announce a deal as soon as next week to acquire the utility's assets.</p>
<p>But Northeast Utilities debt widened around 15-20 basis points as Moody's Investors Service cut the rating on the utility by two notches to Ba3 from Ba1.  </p>
<p>Traders said the majority of the price drop occured on Friday after the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission announced that stranded cost recovery for the Public Service Co of New Hampshire, a Northeast subsidiary, must be based on market prices.</p>
<p>Moody's said the Commission's decision could ultimately force the subsidiary to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, investor reaction was limited to Tele-Communications Inc's announcement on Monday that customer growth in its cable subsidiary rose less than the company had hoped for in 1996.  </p>
<p>Traders said rating agencies have already accounted for the figures in their current ratings and will now be looking at the company's future performance.</p>
<p>In the high-yield market, junk bonds of Heartland Wireless Communications, a wireless cable television company, plummeted nine points as the market reacted to last Friday's news that the company's interim president and CEO had resigned, traders said.</p>
<p>The company bonds were quoted at 80-85 as of the close of the market on Monday.  </p>
<p>Junk bonds of Repap New Brunswick Inc and Repap Wisconsin Inc rose roughly one point as investors reacted favorably to Avenor Inc revised merger offer for Repap Enterprises Inc, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The revised offer makes it much more likely the merger will go through, which is what bondholders care most about,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Bonds of MFS Communications Co, a unit of WorldCom Inc, rose one point on Monday as Standard &amp; poor's upgraded the company's debt to triple BBB-minus from single-B.</p>
<p>MFS, a competitive-local-exchange company, was acquired by WorldCom, the nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier, last year.</p>
<p>S&amp;P stated the ratings reflect the combined company's strengthening position in the U.S. long-distance telephone market and expectation of continuing success for its local market entry strategy, among other things.</p>
<p>The Treasury market closed the day lower, with the benchmark 30-year long bond dropping 12/32 to 97-11/32, yielding 6.83 percent.</p>
