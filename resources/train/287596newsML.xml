<p>Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan has accused the Greek Cypriot government of mounting an arms buildup on the divided island of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Tayan told Anatolian news agency on Saturday that the Greek Cypriot authorities were continuously arming themselves and not displaying the necessary maturity to secure peace in Cyprus.</p>
<p>&quot;This situation will undermine peace in the region. We have warned the countries that sell arms, the USA, Russia and Britain, and the former U.N. secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the issue,&quot; the agency quoted Tayan as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot secure peace through the use of arms. We are closely following developments, and we are determined to fulfill all our obligations. We are on the side of peace. We are not the aggressors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Turkey's &quot;equanimity&quot; on the issue should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>The Greek Cypriot Cyprus News Agency said on Saturday that Cyprus had concluded a contract to buy surface-to-air missiles from Russia.</p>
<p>Turkey's foreign minister Tansu Ciller expressed concern over the planned missile sale during a visit to Russia last month.</p>
<p>Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied its northern third after a coup engineered by the military ruling in Greece at the time. There are 30,000 Turkish troops stationed in the north of the island.</p>
