<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares ended narrowly lower on Monday, with components on the headline AEX index mixed and little clear direction in the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>Trade was slow and interest in individual stocks was focused on those with results due this week, one said.</p>
<p>Standout was steel and aluminium group Hoogovens, still basking in the afterglow of a successful takeover of Belgian steelworks  Boel.</p>
<p>Analysts applauded the deal and several raised 1997 estimates for the firm, which reports 1996 results on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hoogovens rose 2.80 guilders to a record 88.40.  </p>
<p>Retailer Ahold, also due Thursday, also closed at a record, gaining 2.60 guilders to 125.30.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Ahold's fourth quarter net profit to soar by over 60 percent in 1996, compared to a year earlier. Full year net profit is seen 37 percent higher.</p>
<p>Unilever extended a slide that has left the record high of last week a distant memory. The shares hit 380.30 on Wednesday, but profit taking amid the general downturn and U.S. selling have started a selling bandwagon, one trader said.</p>
<p>Unilever ended down 8.40 guilders at 353.40.  </p>
<p>Dutch midcaps were harder hit by negative sentiment in the market, with the AMX index ending below the 1100 level, down 7.02 points at 1093.51.</p>
<p>Tanking firm Van Ommeren dropped 1.40 guilders after several analysts downgraded recommendations from buy to hold after 1996 results in line with expectations.</p>
<p>Window blinds maker Hunter Douglas booked good gains ahead of its results tomorrow, rising 2.50 guilders to 146.00.</p>
<p>Financial stocks lagged through the day, but trimmed losses into the close as news of an ABN AMRO acquisition broke.  </p>
<p>ABN AMRO Chicago Corp said it had agreed to acquire the futures activities of Citicorp. ABN shares finished down 0.50 guilders after standing off as much as 2.60 during the session.</p>
