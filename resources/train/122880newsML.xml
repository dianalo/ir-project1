<p>Bernd Hoelzenbein, a member of West Germany's 1974 World Cup winning side, quit as manager of second division Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday, ending a relationship with the club which began nearly 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Hoelzenbein, who came under fire after the former UEFA Cup winners were relegated from the first division last season, said he would not be renewing his contract which runs until the end of next month.</p>
<p>Hoelzenbein played 420 games for Eintracht between 1967 and 1981.</p>
<p>It is understood Hoelzenbein had problems with new senior figures at the club and felt he may not survive much longer. He left with a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;I recognised the public signals. It hurts,&quot; he said. &quot;I was the scapegoat for everything.&quot;</p>
<p>The role of manager and coach is separate at most German clubs. The coach is responsible for tactics and training while the manager deals with contracts and the signing of new players.</p>
