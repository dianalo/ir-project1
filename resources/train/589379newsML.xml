<p>Teenage striker Raul Gonzalez is struggling for fitness ahead of Real Madrid's game with Valladolid on Sunday as the club look to take another step towards their 27th Spanish league title.</p>
<p>Raul is anxious to play after a week in which he once again showed a maturity which belies his youth. The 19-year-old on Tuesday calmly announced he was not interested in a reported $40 million offer from an unidentified English club.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the best club in the world,&quot; said Raul, declaring that the bid was 'incredible' but that he wouldn't leave the Spanish capital even for double the amount.</p>
<p>Raul shot to prominence aged just 17 in Real's last victorious championship campaign.</p>
<p>He has since gone from strength to strength, and for months Spanish manager Javier Clemente had to endure heavy criticism from fans because of his refusal to pick the youngster.</p>
<p>&quot;Who would you like me to drop?&quot; demanded a defensive Clemente of journalists in one press conference.</p>
<p>But Raul has now convinced even the dour Clemente and is now a first choice for both club and country.</p>
<p>He mixes prodigious talent with an extraordinary temperament having at times carried his older team mates through difficult situations.</p>
<p>In the one of the best personal performances seen in Spain this season Raul took the helm of a Real side down to just 10 men to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 4-1 victory at rivals Atletico.</p>
<p>Raul and the Real squad members have had to call upon all their reserves of character over the past few weeks as Barcelona have nibbled at their lead.</p>
<p>The announcement that coach Fabio Capello would leave the Santiago Bernabeu stadium at the end of the season has rocked the club but the team has responded well to the situation, and despite going down 1-0 to Barcelona last week, are still five points ahead of their arch-rivals with five games remaining.</p>
<p>Full-back Roberto Carlos will miss Sunday's game after his problematic match in the Camp Nou. The Brazilian set-piece specialist put in some uncharacteristically reckless challenges, and was lucky to escape with only a booking.</p>
<p>But Roberto Carlos' fifth yellow card -- and with it automatic suspension-- has created a major problem for Capello. The Italian coach will have to play somebody out of position and may even use international striker Emilio Amavisca as an improvised overlapping fullback on the left. Newly-signed Brazilian Ze Roberto is the other possibility to fill the position.</p>
<p>Real's opponents Valladolid have a poor record at the Bernabeu but will be no pushover this time after surging to an unexpected sixth place.</p>
<p>Only now are Valladolid negotiating bonuses for UEFA Cup qualification as the initial objective was simply survival in the top flight.</p>
<p>So Real will be hoping to prevent this season's surprise outfit also creating the surprise of the weekend.</p>
<p>Barcelona, on a high after Wednesday's Cup Winners' Cup victory, will be without suspended Albert Ferrer, Luis Figo and Hristo Stoichkov for Monday's trip to Celta Vigo.</p>
<p>Third-placed Deportivo Coruna need to beat Sporting Gijon if their fading runners-up hopes are to be maintained. They have never lost at home to Sporting and, with five points to make up on Barca, cannot afford to start now.</p>
<p>Real Betis, a further point back in fourth, play Sevilla, for whom defeat will almost certainly mean relegation.</p>
