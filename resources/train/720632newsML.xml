<title>GREECE: SHORT-END OF GREEK YIELD CURVE DOWN, 10-YR BOND UP.</title>
<headline>SHORT-END OF GREEK YIELD CURVE DOWN, 10-YR BOND UP.</headline>
<dateline>ATHENS 1997-07-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The short end of the Greek depo and forward curves tumbled on higher liquidity, and long tenors eased in calm trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>The 10-year bond recouped earlier losses with its gross redemption yield dipping to 9.18 percent from 9.21 percent but five- and seven-year bonds were trading lower, shrugging off lower interbank rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Overnight drachmas are sharply down, trading around 9.90 percent and other short depos up to two months are also trading lower on forex inflows and the release of excess reserves,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>Longer depos have also eased a tenth of a point, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Implied drachmas rates from forex forwards have fallen a fifth of a point in short periods and a tenth of a point in longer tenors,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Lower interbank rates failed to spark a rally in bonds and FRNs with the exception of the 10-year bond where some local buying drove its yield down to 9.18 percent from 9.21 percent earlier, bond dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Five-and seven-year bonds have not recovered their earlier losses but buying interest from local players has pushed the yield of the 10-year bond down to 9.18 percent,&quot; said a bond trader at a private bank.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 157.19/24 from Thursday's 157.480 fix, the dollar at 277.27/37 drachmas from 276.280 and the ecu at 309.36/46 from 309.55 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;The mark firmed against the drachma picking up steam from a softer ecu/mark and dollar/mark,&quot; said a forex dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;It is trading around 157.43/48.&quot;</p>
<p>The ecu/drachma cross was also trading close to the top of its intraday range of 309.60/65, dealers said.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 10.10-10.60</p>
<p>** T/N at 10.20-10.70</p>
<p>** S/N at 10.20-10.70</p>
<p>** One week at 10.70-11.20</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 10.80-11.30</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 10.80-11.30</p>
<p>** One month at 10.80-11.30</p>
<p>** Two months at 10.70-11.20</p>
<p>** Three months at 10.60-11.10</p>
<p>** Six months at 10.60-11.10</p>
<p>** Nine months at 10.60-11.10</p>
