<p>Matches scheduled for this weekend in the F.A. Cup quarter-finals and English premier league (kick-off times 1500 GMT Saturday unless stated, league positions in parentheses):</p>
<p>F.A. Cup quarter-finals</p>
<p>Derby v Middlesbrough</p>
<p>Derby are looking for a change of fortunes after a 6-1 humiliation at Middlesbrough in the league on Wednesday, their heaviest defeat of their season. Coach Jim Smith is without striker Dean Sturridge, who starts a two match ban, but may recall Chris Powell, now recovered from a knee injury, to bolster his defence. Midfielder Robin van der Laan and defender Jacob Laursen are also doubtful. Middlesbrough are in tremendous cup form even though they prop up the premier league.

Both teams are level on points in the middle of the table and drew 0-0 at Chesterfield last month. The home side await late fitness tests on captain Sean Dyche (hamstring), Andrew Morris (ribs), Paul Holland (groin) and Tom Curtis (hernia), and are definitely without Lee Rogers (knee) and Tony Lormor (ankle). Teenage striker Kevin Davies and defender Darren Carr are both suspended. Wrexham, who were last in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1978, may be without cup hero Kevin Russell, who scored the late winner against West Ham in round four, and fellow striker Karl Connolly through injury.</p>
<p>Portsmouth v Chelsea (Sunday 1330 GMT)</p>
<p>First division Portsmouth have quietly reached the quarter-finals while the plaudits have gone to the second division sides. Coach Terry Fenwick will have a full</p>
