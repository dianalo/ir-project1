<p>A series of scandals that have battered Belgium exposed basic flaws in society and raised the question whether the Italian-style party government could  solve the problems it created.</p>
<p>The term &quot;party government&quot; describes a system in which political parties usurp the proper power of the elected body.</p>
<p>&quot;If Belgium has often been called the Italy of the North, it is because, to a large extent, it is,&quot; said political science professor Lieven De Winter of the Catholic University of Louvain.</p>
<p>De Winter, with an Italian colleague, has just published &quot;Partiocracies between crises and reform: the cases of Italy and Belgium&quot;, a comparison of the two countries' systems. The study could not have come at a more timely moment.</p>
<p>Belgium is reeling from recent discoveries about the 1991 maffia-style murder of socialist party patriarch Andre Cools and from a catalogue of police and judicial bungling in the investigation into a paedophile kidnap, sex and murder ring.</p>
<p>The two cases dealt an unprecedented blow to the people's confidence in the justice system, police and government.</p>
<p>Many Belgians asked whether the Cools murder, and even the sex scandal, was not just a by-product but the very consequence of the way the country's politics worked.</p>
<p>&quot;Cools' murder is the consequence of a system in which some people are able to exert an enormous, nearly occult, power via political parties,&quot; De Winter said.</p>
<p>&quot;Party government is a sick system. Add to that the possible infiltration of organised crime into ministerial cabinets and you get an explosive mix in which people get killed.&quot;</p>
<p>Cools' alleged killers were arrested last week in Tunisia but investigators do still not know who paid them.</p>
<p>De Winter said investigators' main theory was that Cools knew too much about the wheelings and dealings of his own protegees and was about to expose them.</p>
<p>Belgian police have arrested six people in the Cools case, including former minister Alain Van der Biest, who has been charged for involvement in the killing. Van der Biest employed several people of Italian origin who have also been arrested.</p>
<p>Cools was the political kingmaker in Wallonia, the southern, French-speaking half of Belgium. The tentacles of political power permeate all levels of society in Wallonia and Flanders, the northern, Dutch-speaking half.</p>
<p>Jobs in the public sector, from the heads of the state-owned companies down to the cleaners in schools, are by political appointment.</p>
<p>The consequences have been the worst in the judiciary, De Winter said. &quot;In the past 30 years, the political world has deliberately not invested in an efficient justice system, because it did not want strong, independent nosey parkers around.&quot;</p>
<p>Referring to Marc Dutroux, chief suspect in a paedophile ring that is known to have killed four girls, he added: &quot;Political infighting and lack of means at least partly explain the series of blunders in the Dutroux case.&quot;</p>
<p>De Winter said Belgium's tradition of coalition government lay at the origin of its political patronage system.</p>
<p>Since the system of proportional representation did not let any party to implement its own political agenda fully, parties tried to lure voters via &quot;political clientelism&quot;, whereby people turned to politicians to get building permits cleared, university grants increased and traffic fines scrapped.</p>
<p>De Winter said the scandals could lead to a review of the party government system. &quot;Politicians have become aware that political patronage is at the root of all evil here and has to stop.&quot;</p>
