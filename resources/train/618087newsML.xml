<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 27 --------------</p>
<p>* Crude and gas oil may continue to soften in the short term looking for a lead from NYMEX gasoline, but analysts say bullish chart gap supports remain intact and upside targets in view.</p>
<p>* The oil complex will be looking ahead to this week's inventory data to determine whether demand in unleaded gasoline will lend enough support to lead the complex in the short term.</p>
<p>IPE Brent crude and gas oil prices may continue to soften in the short term still looking for a lead from NYMEX unleaded gasoline, but analysts say bullish chart gap supports remain intact and upside targets in view despite recent losses.</p>
<p>Peter Sceats, analyst at CharTech MCS, said, &quot;The five days of side to down action (last week) had little effect on the markets technical profile, at least from a price pattern point of view&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The up trend and the bull gaps are intact and while there is still room to pull back a little the overall thrust of prices is still positive&quot;, Sceats added.</p>
<p>However, while stochastics are still looking &quot;toppy&quot; and last weeks charts hit a Bollinger sell signal, the only dark cloud on the horizon was the fact that spot Brent failed to surmount the $20.84 peak high for March.</p>
<p>&quot;The bull gap at $18.94/$19.00 prevailed untouched and underpins the Brent market, but the bulls will feel more comfortable once Brent's clear upside hurdle of $20.84 is cleared,&quot; Sceats said.</p>
<p>Al Graham of Elliott Wave International, Gainesville, Georgia said he was still looking for the price to go above $20.60 from $19.75.</p>
<p>&quot;An inability to hold $19.75 support would postpone but in no way eliminate longer tern bullish expectations,&quot; Graham said.</p>
<p>July Brent settled on Friday 18 cents lower, bang on $20 a barrel level deemed crucial support.</p>
<p>June gas oil closed $1.25 lower at $177.75 a tonne. The $173 to $176.50 gap-up for gas oil also remains supportively intact.</p>
<p>However, slow stochastics lines crossed on the 80 percent overbought line last Thursday giving the market a more bearish tone, but some analysts see the market taking &quot;a brief neutral stance&quot; in early Tuesday trade with the market still stuck in the $175/$180 per tonne range.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude oil futures prices tumbled at the end of the day on Friday to settle broadly lower, pulling products down in kind, as a last batch of long position were liquidated ahead of the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>July crude added to Friday's losses and was trading 14 cents lower at around $21.49 a barrel in NYMEX ACCESS trade. Unleaded gasoline for June delivery was off half a cent at around 66.40 cents a gallon with a gap down opening between Friday's 66.92 cent close and opening ACCESS trade at 66.55 cents. June heating oil stood 0.32 cent lower at 57.20 cents.</p>
<p>Analysts said the oil complex will be looking ahead to this week's inventory data to determine whether demand in unleaded gasoline will lend enough support to lead the complex in the short term.</p>
<p>With peak demand season for unleaded gasoline at hand at last weekend's unofficial beginning of summer in the U.S., crude oil will be taking a back seat to unleaded, they said.</p>
