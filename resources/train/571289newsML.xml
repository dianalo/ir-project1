<p>Nathan Astle hit a century and took four wickets as New Zealand grabbed a 22-run victory over Pakistan in a high-scoring start to the four-nation Independence Cup one-day tournament on Friday.</p>
<p>Man-of-the-match Astle cracked 117 runs off 132 balls in New Zealand's total of 285 for seven from 50 overs, before subduing Pakistan's reply with figures of four for 43.</p>
<p>Having put New Zealand in, Pakistan began their run-chase on a rousing note as Shahid Afridi hammered a belligerent 59 off 46 balls, with four boundaries and two towering sixes off medium-fast bowler Andrew Penn.</p>
<p>Ijaz Ahmed and Salim Malik bolstered the Pakistan score with a 81-run fourth-wicket stand off 103 balls, but Pakistan lost momentum after their departure against accurate bowling by Astle and Larsen, backed by some brilliant fielding.</p>
<p>Earlier, Astle and fellow opener Bryan Young put on 155 off 145 balls against a straying Pakistani attack to register New Zealand's highest first-wicket stand in 48 one-day matches.</p>
<p>Astle's chanceless knock came off 132 balls, with two sixes and eight fours on an excellent batting pitch.</p>
<p>Young's 59 came off 65 balls and contained five boundaries before he was yorked by an inswinger from paceman Abdul Razzak. Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, who took three for 38, was Pakistan's best bowler.</p>
<p>India and Sri Lanka are the other two teams in the tournament commemorating 50 years of India's independence from Britain.</p>
