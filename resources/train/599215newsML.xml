<p>The European Commission and Britain were starting talks on Tuesday to tighten rules on &quot;quota hopping&quot; fishing vessels, British Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jack Cunningham said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Quota hopping is at the top of our agenda,&quot; Cunningham told a news briefing after a getting-to-know-you meeting with EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed that our officials and Bonino's officials will start talks this afternoon to seek agreement on a common way forward,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Quota hopping is the practice whereby foreign fishermen have legally set up flag of convenience operations in Britain and bought licences giving them a share of the British fish quota.</p>
<p>Some 150 foreign vessels, mainly Spanish and Dutch owned, now take over one quarter of the British quota.</p>
<p>Cunningham said the new British Labour government would like if possible to see a protocal agreed on &quot;quota hoppers&quot; at the inter-governmental conference in Amsterdam in June.</p>
<p>The former Conservative gopvernment had threatened to block a review of the EU treaty by the conference unless the 15-nation bloc changed its fishing policies.</p>
<p>British Fisheries Minister Elliot Morley said British registered vessels should have a close connection with Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;There ought to be a strong link between the member state and the operation of those vessels,&quot; he said, adding that he was encouraged by Bonino's &quot;very positive&quot; response.</p>
<p>Currently &quot;quota hopper&quot; vessels ccould operate without coming near British ports, he said, adding, &quot;That's what we want to tighten up on.&quot;</p>
<p>Cunningham said the government accepted proposals for fishing cuts to safeguard threatened stocks but it could take some time to implement.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are no fish stocks there's no fishing industry. We accept that,&quot; he said, adding that Britain was entitled to see a positive EU response to British problems.</p>
<p>The Conservatives had suggested that if &quot;quota hoppers&quot; were removed there would be virtually no need for British fishing cutbacks.</p>
<p>A European Commission spokesman welcomed what he described as the pragmatic approach showed by the new government.</p>
<p>&quot;There are legal ways of tightening up. We have said for months that there should be an economic link between fishing licences and local fishing communities,&quot; fisheries spokesman Filippo di Robilant said.</p>
