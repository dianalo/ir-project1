<p>Veterinary experts on Wednesday voted to maintain the European Union's export ban on Dutch pigs because of swine fever for a further week, a European Commission official said.</p>
<p>The EU standing veterinary committee said the ban will be reviewed at their next meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The veterinary committee has ended its discussions and the ban remains in force for another week,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The export ban affecting all but a small area of the Netherlands was imposed last week after outbreaks of swine fever believed to have been caused by animals imported from Germany.</p>
<p>A 60-day export ban on pigs from four German states also remains in force.</p>
<p>The European Commission announced on Tuesday that it will pay 70 per cent of the cost of slaughtering pigs in both the Netherlands and Germany.</p>
<p>The veterinary committee heard that an inspection team which visited the Netherlands last week had reported that the country's swine fever controls were excellent.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the word the report used although there was criticism that insufficient blood samples had been taken at the start of the epidemic,&quot; a Dutch diplomat told Reuters. -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800</p>
