<p>A decline in African coffee production would not be reversed in the near future because of disease and civil war in the continent, the Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The quantitative decline in African coffees has been evident for some time and there is no real hope of reversing the situation in the immediate future,&quot; said Arega Worku, secretary-general of the Abidjan-based IACO.</p>
<p>&quot;This sad state of affairs constitutes a handicap for the majority of our national economies, especially as African coffee production is confronted with the permanent menace of diseases, particularly trachemycosis currently prevalent in former Zaire and Uganda,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Arega spoke at an international conference on coffee science where around 200 delegates from 40 consumer and producer countries are discussing latest coffee technologies.</p>
<p>Civil strife has affected production in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire). Refugees in Tanzania have reduced land available for coffee expansion, according to Tanzanian officials.</p>
<p>IACO officials put Africa's total coffee production at 14-15 million bags and forecast a target of 20-21 million bags. But they also said Africa found that modest target very difficult to achieve and expected a decline rather than growth.</p>
<p>Arega said there was also a fall in coffee quality caused by use of outdated farming practices and aggravated by lack of sustained research mainly due to scarcity of cash.</p>
<p>He said &quot;careless&quot; liberalisation also induced a decline in quality and African countries in which government still held a huge stake in the industry saw stable quality control.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is not easy for IACO member countries which suffer losses in revenue resulting in the reduction of development programmes and general poverty of the rural folk who produce coffee,&quot; Arega told delegates.</p>
<p>Arega said Africa's major problems remained inadequate funding and lack of qualified personnel, isolation and lack of incentives for researchers and dispersal of research work.</p>
<p>&quot;Less than five countries out of the 25 comprising the organisation have an appropriate research institute with qualified staff,&quot; Arega said.</p>
<p>But Arega added that money from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and European Union have helped Africans create a research network whose principal objective is to promote scientific cooperation between member states and research institutions.</p>
<p>Opening the conference, Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti called on coffee experts to seek ways to stabilise prices. He said that wide fluctuations made planning difficult for farmers, especially when prices declined persistently.</p>
<p>Global prices have been reasonably high in recent months owing to tight supplies around the globe. IACO's Arega said prices were very likely to fall in 1998.</p>
