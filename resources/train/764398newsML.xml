<p>Conditions in the Western Europe wool textile industry continue to improve steadily, the International Wool Secretariat (IWS) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Activity in early-stage industries in China, India and Australia were also improving, but pipeline activity had weakened in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, it said in a survey.</p>
<p>Releasing the IWS Wool Business Conditions Survey for the June quarter, information and planning director Ian Hilton said steadily improving demand in China, India and Western Europe was driving the market, but weakness in the Asia-Pacific region was tempering growth.  </p>
<p>&quot;Improving wool prices in Australia last quarter reflected the increase in activity at the early stages of the pipeline in Europe, China and Australia and falling top stocks everywhere,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rising top orders for the September quarter should help maintain raw wool demand, but some volatility should be expected from weaker conditions in the Asia Pacific region and the volume of raw wool offered to the market, he said.</p>
<p>In Western Europe, while some of the buoyant ordering of last quarter had tempered, demand remained steady, he said.  </p>
<p>The industry reported a positive outlook for the September quarter, with improving order levels sustaining increased output, Hilton said.</p>
<p>In the Paciific region, encompassing Japan, Korea and Taiwan, conditions weakened in the June quarter with lower orders resulting in a slowdown in activity, he said.</p>
<p>Orders for top deteriorated sharply and worsrted yarn orders pulled back from the buoyant levels of the March quarter. There were no signs of a stock build-up at early stages, he said.</p>
<p>Output slowed at combing and fell below year earlier levels at worsted spinning, particularly in Korea and Taiwan, he said.  </p>
<p>Combers and spinners expected activity in the September quarter to fall below year earlier levels, Hilton said.</p>
<p>Australian combing activity continued to strengthen in the June quarter after strong demand for wool tops and with stock levels normal.</p>
<p>Orders for tops reached their highest level in two years, production remains buoyant and further growth is expected in the September quarter, he said.</p>
<p>The Chinese wool industry expected further demand improvements in the September quarter.  </p>
<p>China's raw wool demand should be more stable this quarter, Hilton said.</p>
<p>Strong orders were driving production increases in India, while in Turkey activity is slowing because of high output stocks, he said.</p>
