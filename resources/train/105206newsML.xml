<title>HONG KONG: HK activists in island protest at Japan consulate.</title>
<headline>HK activists in island protest at Japan consulate.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-10-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>A dozen demonstrators stormed Japan's consulate on Wednesday as tensions simmered over rival sovereignty claims to a group of islands in the East China Sea, but they left when police arrived.</p>
<p>Waving banners with the slogans &quot;Down with Japanese militarism&quot;, &quot;Protest against Japanese government interference in the Diaoyu isles&quot;, the protesters chanted slogans in the lobby of the consulate in the heart of Hong Kong's financial centre.</p>
<p>&quot;No one has been arrested, no injury. They were just yelling, chanting slogans. When police arrived...they left,&quot; a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>But consulate spokesman Tsuguyoshi Hada said a consulate employee and a security guard were injured.</p>
<p>The group, led by Democratic Party lawmaker Tsang Kin-shing, was evicted by police promptly after the consulate called for help, Hada said.</p>
<p>Tsang had just returned from a protest trip to the islands, which China calls the Diaoyus and Japan the Senkakus.</p>
<p>On the voyage he and other activists, including some from Taiwan, pierced a Japanese maritime cordon and planted flags on one of the uninhabited rocky islets on Monday.</p>
<p>Japan has claimed the islands since 1895 and refuses to admit that sovereignty is open to discussion. China has claimed sovereignty over them for centuries. Taiwan also claims them.</p>
<p>The Japanese consulate has asked for extra police protection in recent weeks and has appealed to Japanese living in Hong Kong to take precautions.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there are no concrete threats, it's probably better for you to be careful,&quot; is the message being given to Japanese residents in Hong Kong, Hada said.</p>
<p>The protest movement has spiralled in Chinese communities in East Asia since a Japanese right-wing group erected a lighthouse and planted flags on the islands, northeast of Taiwan, in July.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Xinhua news agency's Hong Kong office, Beijing's de facto embassy, said it had received a letter from Japanese rightists threatening the life of Chinese people in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>Police said on Wednesday they were monitoring the situation closely after the official's claim, but no such attacks had been reported.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten urged Xinhua to give police a copy of the threatening letter for investigation.</p>
<p>He also said there was no justification for breaking into the Japanese consulate.</p>
<p>&quot;I recognise how strongly feelings run on the particular issue, which has been the focus of demonstrations, and I will always defend absolutely people's right to express their views, to demonstrate their views, with this qualification: they must always act within the law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If people today have not acted within the law then that lets down the cause which they believe in. And if there has been a break-in to diplomatic premises there is absolutely no justification for it whatsoever,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Patten said the police would make sure the consulate was properly protected if it emerged such protection became necessary.</p>
<p>Hada, the Japanese consulate spokesman, called the incident &quot;regrettable&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Consulate General of Japan strongly requests all parties concerned to express their opinions in a peaceful and legal manner,&quot; said Hada. &quot;The Japanese consulate has formally requested that the Hong Kong government takes appropriate action with regard to this event.&quot;</p>
