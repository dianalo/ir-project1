<headline>Ecuador's Bucaram to get more security in Panama.</headline>
<dateline>PANAMA CITY 1997-03-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Panama's government has offered to boost security around ousted Ecuadorean President Abdala Bucaram after he received a bomb threat on Saturday, a spokesman for the former leader said.</p>
<p>Bucaram changed the location of a strategy meeting with political supporters after receiving the threat on Saturday in a Panama City hotel, Carlos Bustamante told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We received a call about a bomb threat at the hotel. A bomb squad arrived with dogs but nothing was found,&quot; Bustamante said. &quot;The Panamanian government offered protection to Bucaram.&quot;</p>
<p>Security officials at the Plaza Paitilla Hotel where the meeting was to be held denied there was a a bomb threat, but confirmed to Reuters that dogs did sniff the premises.</p>
<p>&quot;We have our own security and team of dogs for routine checks when there are high-profile guests, especially for someone as controversial as Bucaram,&quot; said one security official.</p>
<p>Bucaram moved the meeting with 53 political supporters to a restaurant adjacent to the hotel to plan a re-election campaign and create a strategy to file a conspiracy lawsuit against interim President Fabian Alarcon.</p>
<p>Bucaram moved to Panama on Feb. 17 after being dismissed by Ecuador's Congress for &quot;mental incompetence.&quot;</p>
<p>Ecuador's Supreme Court initiated criminal proceedings against Bucaram, and issued arrest warrants against three former aides.</p>
<p>Bucaram lived in exile in Panama from 1985-90 after he fled Ecuador when he was charged with corruption as mayor of Guayaquil.</p>
