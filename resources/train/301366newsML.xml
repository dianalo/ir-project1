<p>Italian Alberto Tomba, who went to bed with flu after the first leg of a men's World Cup slalom on Sunday, will miss the next race, a giant slalom on Tuesday in Adelboden, Switzerland, his manager said.</p>
<p>Giorgio Sgorlon said the world champion had been examined by the Italian team doctor who advised him not to take part in Tuesday's race.</p>
<p>The triple Olympic gold medallist hesitated to come to the the French Alps resort of Chamonix at all after a flare-up of pain in the wrist which he injured in a fall last October forced him to halt training in Italy on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tomba clocked the second fastest time in the first leg of Sunday's slalom but did not start the second. The race was won by Austrian Thomas Sykora.</p>
<p>Tomba, who has had a difficult start to the season, hopes to be back for a slalom on Sunday in Wengen, Switzerland. His main goal this season are next month's world championships in Sestriere, Italy, in which he hopes to excel before his home fans.</p>
