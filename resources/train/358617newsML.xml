<p>-- PACE PROFIT ALERT SENDS SHARES TO LOW POINT</p>
<p>Pace Mircro Technology, makers of satellite decoder boxes, issued a profits warning yesterday sending shares down by 25 percent. The company said broadcasters in key markets in Latin America and Italy had missed their forecasts. The company, which floated last year at 172p, closed yesterday at 169.5p, the lowest point in its brief stock market history.</p>
<p>-- MAID HITS AT 'MANIPULATORS'</p>
<p>MAID, the computer information group, yesterday claimed that its share price may have been forced down by sophisticated international selling. The company reported that trading had remained in line with the board's expectations and that it was aware of no reason why shares in the company had fallen from 310p to 150p since October last year.</p>
<p>-- SCOTAM POLICY HOLDERS ADVISED TO HOLD FIRE</p>
<p>With Scottish Amicable's complex document detailing flotation proposals due to be sent out later this week, independent financial advisers have recommended that policy holders delay making any decisions about the life assurance company's flotation plans until all potential bidders emerge.</p>
<p>THE TIMES</p>
<p>-- POUND GAINS ON DOUBTS OVER EMU TIMETABLE</p>
<p>The pound gained strongly again yesterday on doubt throughout Europe over whether a single currency will go ahead as scheduled with the planned membership. Investors are assuming Britain will not be among the first wave to join. Markets are awaiting the outcome of today's monetary meeting between Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George, as well as the outcome of the meeting of America's Federal Open Market Committee.</p>
<p>-- OFGAS PLANS TO DISMANTLE TRANSCO</p>
<p>British Gas's pipeline operation, TransCo, could end up being scaled down dramatically under plans by industry regulator Clare Spottiswoode. British Gas is preparing to split its gas supply and pipes operations next week, and many of TransCo's functions will be thrown open to competition.</p>
<p>-- CLARKE URGED BY CBI TO RESIST BANK PRESSURE FOR A RATE RISE</p>
<p>The Confederation of British Industry's latest regional industrial trends survey shows manufacturing orders rising significantly in only four of Britain's 11 regions, as the stronger pound drives back export orders. The CBI used the survey to urge Kenneth Clarke to resist Bank of England pressure for an interest rates rise at today's monthly monetary meeting.</p>
<p>THE GUARDIAN</p>
<p>-- WRANGLE HITS COPPER CASE</p>
<p>George Staple, the outgoing director of the Serious Fraud Office, and four of his officers were yesterday accused of having ignored an injunction prohibiting the copying of computer records. A contempt of court hearing over what should have been a routine search and seizure raid relating to the multi-billion pound stg Sumitomo copper scandal was heard by Lord Justice Staughton and Mr Justice Scott Baker ahead of an attempt to have the original search warrants declared unlawful.</p>
<p>-- CLYDE REJECTS 495 MILLION POUNDS FINAL OFFER</p>
<p>Clyde Petroleum yesterday rejected Gulf Canada's improved offer of 495 million pounds stg. Gulf claimed it's offer is a substantial increase for Clyde shareholders and accused Clyde of having an abysmal exploration record and poor return on capital, and will show almost no growth in discretionary cash flow in 1997. Clyde responded by saying that the offer did not recognise its future potential as an independent company nor had the Canadians taking into account its reserves and record production levels.</p>
<p>-- C&amp;G SAVERS IN LINE FOR TAX WINDFALL</p>
<p>A landmark ruling on the tax status of windfall bonuses yesterday could land thousands of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester customers with a tax rebate. The ruling stems from a complaint brought by two C&amp;G savers who received cash bonuses when the building society was acquired by Lloyds Bank in 1995.</p>
<p>The complaint is against an Inland Revenue order that they must each pay up to 3,000 pounds stg in capital gains tax on their cash windfalls.</p>
<p>THE INDEPENDENT</p>
<p>-- TRIPLEX AND CITIGATE RAPPED BY PANEL FOR LEAKING DTI LETTER</p>
<p>The Takeover Panel yesterday formally rebuked Midlands engineer Triplex Lloyd and Citigate, its PR adviser, for leaking to the press a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry containing confidential information about bid target William Cook, the steel casings group. Triplex has to decide whether to top an 80 million pound management buyout of Cook, after valuing the company at 73.8 million pounds.</p>
<p>-- PIA MEMBERS THREATENED OVER PENSIONS REVIEW</p>
<p>The Personal Investment Authority is to mount a crackdown on its members if they fail to meet an year-end target to resolve the pensions compensation scandal. It is considering banning independent financial advisers from working in the financial services industry and fining life companies if they fail to resolve pension reviews. The measures follow the authority's November admission that its members were a year behind a 1995 deadline to resolve the scandal.</p>
<p>-- POWER STRUGGLE MAY SEE LAZARDS RUN BY COMMITTEE</p>
<p>Michel David-Weill, the financier running Lazards, may hand over power to a committee of three to five rather than a single individual. The idea is being touted as one solution to succession struggles that have seen a rift develop between Mr David-Weill and son-in-law Edouard Stern, until recently touted as the natural heir.</p>
