<p>Global investment bank Lehman Brothers said on Monday it expects India to achieve annual economic growth of seven percent and foresees the evolution of the country's debt market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are talking about something in the seven percent range which is a bit less than what I have heard from some others,&quot; C. Daniel Tyree, chairman of Lehman Brothers Asia, told Reuters television when asked for his forecast for India's 1997/98 (April-March) fiscal year.</p>
<p>&quot;But (seven percent is) still very significant when compared to what's going on in Europe, the US and other parts of Asia. That's a very positive number,&quot; Tyree said.</p>
<p>India expects its gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at a real rate of seven percent or more in the fiscal year starting on April 1, officials said on Saturday. The economy is forecast to post GDP growth of 6.8 percent in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Tyree told reporters earlier that the development of a debt market and the growth of infrastructure was critical to India's economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The development of a debt market will provide an alternate route to funds,&quot; Tyree said. &quot;As Indian capital markets open up, swaps will develop and eventually futures and options will emerge.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;There is a clear acknowledgement that infrastructure is critical to India's development.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as Tyree spoke, a working group set up by the Indian government said companies should be allowed to issue derivatives, options and quasi-equity instruments.</p>
<p>&quot;Indian companies should be enabled to issue hybrids, derivatives, options, as well as shares and quasi-equity instruments with differential rights,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said hybrids were a combination of securities including their derivatives or options.</p>
<p>Tyree said in the Reuters interview that Finance Minister P. Chidambaram's proposal in the fiscal budget for 1997/98 to do groundwork towards moving to capital-account convertibility of the rupee was also a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is the right step, it has to be done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government in the budget asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up a panel to &quot;lay out the road map towards capital account convertibility.&quot;</p>
<p>But Tyree cautioned that capital account convertibility must be carried out in a phased manner.</p>
<p>&quot;I think something like convertibility ought to be done in a thoughful way,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the next couple of years is a good time-frame.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyree told reporters that the policies proposed in the 1997/98 budget, which Chidambaram unveiled last Friday, would help India's capital markets appreciate in the long term.</p>
<p>&quot;But there will be corrections along the way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chidambaram's 1997/98 federal budget was &quot;a big step in the right direction,&quot; Tyree said. &quot;We are very positive about what the Finance Minister and the government have said on Friday.&quot;</p>
<p>Chidambaram on Friday cut corporate and income taxes and slashed import tariffs in the budget for 1997/98.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers expanded its India operations on Monday by opening a new office in New Delhi which will serve as headquarters for the firm's investment banking and related activities in the sub-continent.</p>
