<p>Most Peruvians back President Alberto Fujimori's handling of the 61-day Lima hostage crisis and want talks to bring about a peaceful end to the ordeal to continue, a leading pollster said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Apoyo S.A., the country's leading polling firm, said 60 percent of those surveyed favoured how Fujimori has managed the crisis sparked by the storming of the Japanese ambassador's residence by Marxist rebels on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>The pollster said 34 percent disapproved of the government's crisis management and six percent were unsure.</p>
<p>The poll results were released on local television, which did not give a margin of error or say how many people were surveyed.</p>
<p>The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) originally took hundreds of captives but has released all but 72 mostly middle-aged men. The rebels' main demand is the release of 400 comrades they say are suffering inhuman conditions in Peru's prisons, something Fujimori has flatly refused to consider.</p>
<p>Apoyo said 70 percent of those polled feel the government must continue its dialogue with the rebels despite a lack of tangible results after three rounds of preliminary talks in the past week.</p>
<p>But it also said 25 percent favour military intervention to end the siege, while five percent were undecided.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pollster said 71 percent of those surveyed feel jail conditions for imprisoned MRTA guerrillas ought to be improved, while 65 percent feel the government should review the cases of those jailed for terrorism.</p>
<p>The pollster also said 66 percent of those polled feel the government should allow the roughly 15 MRTA rebels holding the residence to leave the country as a possible solution.</p>
<p>But if even one of the hostages dies, 65 percent favour military intervention while just 26 percent feel conversations should continue, Apoyo said.</p>
