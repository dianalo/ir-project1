<p>One of the favourites to take command of Britain's Conservative party after its crushing election defeat said on Friday he was still backing leader John Major.</p>
<p>&quot;I will stand by him as long as he is leader of the Conservative party and so (will) a very large majority of the Conservative party,&quot; outgoing Welsh secretary William Hague told BBC television.</p>
<p>Hague, just 36, has long been tipped as a leading contender to take over the job of party chief but the scale of the government's defeat has sparked speculation that Major could resign sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Hague declined to comment when asked whether he would put his hat in the ring, saying it was important that the party took a long considered look at the reasons for its defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;We need some cool reflecion...not any decisions made in a hurry,&quot; he said, taking pains to stress his support for Major.</p>
<p>&quot;I support him as leader of the Conservative party...I'm obviously in favour of him staying as leader of the Conservative party if he wishes to do so.&quot; -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7950</p>
