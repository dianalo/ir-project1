<p>Taiwan chipmakers said on Thursday that a shakeup in the global memory-chip market had run its course, and forecast profits for the hard-hit 16-megabit sector despite a long and precarious downturn in prices.</p>
<p>Several Taiwan semiconductor companies said production of 16MB dynamic random-access memory chips, called DRAMs, would continue to dominate the island's chip-making industry rather than the costlier, next-generation 64MB DRAMs.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no plan to follow other foreign firms' suit to cut back production in 16-megabit DRAMs,&quot; said a spokeswoman at TI-Acer Inc, a joint venture of Taiwan's computer giant Acer Inc and U.S. giant Texas Instruments.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, we have decided to concentrate on production of 16-megabit DRAMs this year. We intend to run at full capacity. The price for 16-Megabit DRAMs has stabilised,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Winbond Electronics Corp, Taiwan's third largest semiconductor maker, has even more ambitious plans.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only will we retain our total investment but also we will continue our expansion plans,&quot; Winbond spokesman Liu Chung-kwang said by telephone.</p>
<p>Winbond planned to start making 16MB DRAMs in 1997.  </p>
<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the island's largest semiconductor maker, would also start producing 16MB DRAMs or more advanced products for Fujitsu Ltd at a new plant between 1997 and 2000.</p>
<p>DRAMs are rapidly becoming a commodity in the microcomputer industry. Because the amount of memory installed in a computer is a key measure of its speed and efficiency, market demand to cram more megabits of memory onto a chip is enormous.</p>
<p>Many Japanese semiconductor makers have announced cutbacks in memory-chip investments in recent months and begun shifting production to 64MB DRAMs following a fall in 16MB chip prices.</p>
<p>While 4MB DRAMS are industry dinosaurs and 16MB technology may have seen better days, the market has yet to fully embrace the far more expensive 64-megabit benchmark -- leaving plenty of life for manufacturers in the 16MB range.</p>
<p>&quot;Local makers may still find profits in the 16-megabit market this year. But 16-megabit DRAMs will be a short-lived product,&quot; said Nikko Securities research chief Michael Hung. &quot;They'll have to shift to 64-megabit chips sooner or later.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts say a shift to 64MB chips is inevitable.</p>
<p>TI-Acer has stopped making 4MB DRAM chips altogether, phasing them out since June due to plunging prices.  </p>
<p>Both TI-Acer and Winbond said they planned to shift to 64MB chips from the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see a huge demand for 64-megabit chips at the moment,&quot; the TI-Acer spokeswoman said. &quot;We are not eager to jump into the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Liu said Winbond, which has a 64MB production technology agreement with Japan's Toshiba Corp, will use the higher technology to produce its lower-tech 16MB DRAMs next year.</p>
<p>Toshiba has said Winbond may start mass-production of 64MB DRAMs in Taiwan by the end of 1998, but a final decision has not been made.</p>
