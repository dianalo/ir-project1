<headline>Bre-X releases results of Freeport tests.</headline>

<p>Canadian gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Thursday that tests on the Busang gold site by partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc have indicated &quot;insignificant amounts of gold&quot; and visual differences in gold particles from core holes.</p>
<p>Bre-X made the comments in a statement which included the results of confirmatory drilling conducted to date by New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan.</p>
<p>Bre-X also expressed its concerns to the Toronto Stock Exchange regarding the resumption of trading in Bre-X shares before an independent audit of its Busang findings is complete.  </p>
<p>Bre-X said Freeport's confirmatory drilling consisted of seven diamond drill holes.</p>
<p>Four holes (BSSE-63A, 173A, 202A and 217A) were drilled parallel to holes drilled by Bre-X (BSSE-63, 173, 202 and 217), with collars approximately 1.5 metres from the Bre-X collar holes, the statement said.</p>
<p>Two scissor holes (BSSE-63D and 202D) were drilled with inclinations of -60 degrees northeast, in contrast to the -60 degree southwest inclination of the Bre-X holes collared nearby. One hole (BSSE-173A) was drilled with an inclination of -60 degrees south, the statement said.  </p>
<p>All the Freeport holes were approximately 250 metres deep. All were conducted by bottle-roll cyanide-extraction, the statement said.</p>
<p>Freeport also performed standard fire-assays on samples from certain of the core holes drilled by Freeport and on samples from certain core holes drilled by Bre-X.</p>
<p>&quot;These fire-assays have indicated insignificant amounts of gold in those samples. FCX (Freeport) also noticed visual differences in gold particles contained in samples from core holes drilled by FCX and core holes drilled by Bre-X,&quot; the statement said.  </p>
<p>Bre-X said Freeport has indicated that its findings are preliminary and incomplete and that it will provide Bre-X with additional information as Freeport continues with its work.</p>
<p>Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X admitted on Wednesday that test samples from the Busang gold property on the island of Borneo may have been overstated.</p>
<p>The news came just one week after the mysterious death of Bre-X's chief Busang geologist, who plunged out of a helicopter into the jungle in an apparent suicide.</p>
<p>Bre-X has hired Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd, an independent Canadian mining industry consultant, to conduct an audit of the drilling and sampling programs done by both Bre-X and Freeport.</p>
<p>This audit will include the drilling of further core samples and will take approximately four weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Bre-X has expressed its concerns to the Toronto Stock Exchange regarding the resumption of trading in Bre-X shares prior to the completion of the audit by Strathcona,&quot; the statement said.</p>
