<p>Ansett New Zealand is expected to report another profit despite high fuel costs and traffic disruptions caused by had weather and congestion, the New Zealand Press Association reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, the airline -- now wholly owned by News Ltd -- has produced two consecutive profits totalling NZ$11 million.</p>
<p>Ansett New Zealand was previously owned by Ansett Australia which in turn was jointly owned by News and TNT Ltd  but News took direct control of Ansett NZ when Air New Zealand bought TNT's share of Ansett Australia.  </p>
<p>While the airline's new chief executive, Kevin Doddrell, concedes it was a comparatively small drop in the bucket compared the $200 million in losses accumulated since 1987, some comfort could be taken that the results were at last continuing to move in the right direction.</p>
<p>Doddrell said in an interview he preferred not to talk &quot;specifically and prematurely&quot; about current results.</p>
<p>&quot;Suffice to say we are satisfied with progress even though we have had to cope with fuel increases and other unforeseen commitments, but yes, we will be profitable again this year.&quot;  </p>
<p>Recent research had shown the airline was continuing to gain market share on main trunk routes, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe we have about 45 percent of the business market and 27 percent to 28 percent of the leisure market.&quot;</p>
<p>Doddrell described the airline as being very secure. &quot;I'm very happy with the ownership change,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our new owners have been totally supportive of a number of proposed marketing strategies that we now have in place to help us as an independent operation.&quot;</p>
<p>Next week, the airline will increase the size of its fleet of jets with the arrival of a tenth BAe146-300.  </p>
<p>Asked if Ansett still viewed Air New Zealand as a competitor, Doddrell replied: &quot;Competition against Air New Zealand is going to be stronger than it has ever been. We recently appointed a new advertising agency, and revitalised promotional campaigns will be launched shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked what would happen to air fares, he said: &quot;I would be reluctant to predict anything because the market is volatile and could be affected by a number of factors such as new competitors, new alliances, and new partnerships.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose that's one of the things that makes this industry so interesting.&quot;  </p>
<p>Doddrell said the fuel price situation was serious, with prices continuing to rise. &quot;Even in the last two weeks, the price has gone up by a further cent a litre,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The airline was also concerned at delays caused by air traffic congestion around Auckland and Wellington, which had added to costs.</p>
<p>Doddrell was not prepared to disclose the &quot;considerable amount&quot; involved, but said that flight times on the Auckland- Wellington sectors were taking 10 to 15 minutes longer than scheduled on a regular basis.  </p>
<p>Doddrell confirmed the airline was talking to Qantas with a view to developing a commercial relationship.</p>
<p>&quot;Qantas now carries more than 30 percent of inbound traffic to New Zealand so it simply makes sense for us to seek an alliance.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Ansett viewed Qantas as the preferred international carrier for its customers, especially on trans-Tasman routes. &quot;It is a good relationship and I think it will grow,&quot; Doddrell said.  </p>
<p>Ansett New Zealand already has code-share arrangements with Cathay Pacific, United Airlines, and Malaysia Airlines. Doddrell said the airline had no plans to change its name or its livery.</p>
