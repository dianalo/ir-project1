<headline>IBCA says affirms Russian Eurobond at BB plus.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-21</dateline>

<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Thursday it affirmed its BB plus long-term rating for the Russian Federation's $1.0 billion bond due November 2001.  </p>
<p>The BB plus rating was first assigned to the Russian Federation in October, IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;It was underpinned by the strong growth of export receipts from oil and gas, which had continued throughout the transition slump, and which had ensured consistent surpluses on the current account of the balance of payments,&quot; IBCA said.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia also benefits from relatively low external debt ratios despite the decision to assume all the external debt of the former Soviet Union, of which it formed just one of fifteen successor states and accounted for half the population,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The official GDP figures do not fully represent what is happening to activity in the economy, IBCA said, as they paint a picture of steadily declining output for six years.</p>
<p>&quot;But other indicators - such as real incomes, consumer spending and electricity output - all suggest that the Russian economy is now growing,&quot; IBCA said.</p>
<p>&quot;The potential for future growth is particularly strong given the easy availability of foreign currency earnings, the increasing consensus on the need for sound macro-economic policies, and the high educational level of the population which is similar to western Europe rather than a typical country with Russia's living standards,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>IBCA said Russia also benefits from the special interest that the international community has in its stability, which had led not only to the availability of credit (from Germany and France) earlier this year but also to a special status such as de facto membership of the Group of Seven - now eight - leading industrial countries.</p>
