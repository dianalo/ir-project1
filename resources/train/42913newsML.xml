<p>German tennis star Boris Becker pulled out of his first match in the Romanian open tennis tournament on Tuesday (Corrects from Monday), complaining to the umpire that he was in pain.</p>
<p>Becker, ranked sixth in the ATP, retired in the ninth game of the first set when he was trailing 5-3 to unseeded Christian Ruud of Norway.  </p>
<p>It was not immediately apparent if the problem Becker was having was in his right wrist, which he injured during a match at Wimbledon in June and which forced his withdrawal from that event.</p>
<p>The Australian Open champion has not played a tournament since then, also missing the U.S. Open over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Becker was the top seed of the Romanian clay court event, which awards $500,000 in prize money and which was badly hit by the withdrawal of top players.</p>
<p>The second seed is world number four Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, who plays his first match against Romanian Andrei Pavel on Wednesday.</p>
