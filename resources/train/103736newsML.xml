<title>UK: US, Euro refinery autumn shutdowns modest - IEA.</title>
<headline>US, Euro refinery autumn shutdowns modest - IEA.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Refinery maintenance shutdowns in the United States and Europe are expected to be significantly lower this autumn compared to last year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. But an estimated 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of capacity in Asia is scheduled to close during October, the IEA said in it's latest Monthly Oil Market Report.</p>
<p>In the U.S. mainentance closures are projected to be at the lowest level for more than five years while European shutdowns which are set to reach only half the level of last year may be partly deferred due to strong gasoil demand and good margins.</p>
<p>Although margins in the U.S. and northwest Europe fell in September, margins were up in the Mediterranean and, to a lesser extent, in Singapore.</p>
<p>Margins for running sour crudes in the Mediterranean rose sharply early in Sepotember supported by strong distillate and fuel oil prices which rose appreciably more than crude.</p>
<p>The margin for simple refineries rose by more than that for complex plants, consistent with larger rises in gas oil and fuel prices than for lighter products.</p>
<p>Margins in Rotterdam fell under pressure from weak gasoline which more than offset firm middle distillate prices.</p>
<p>On the U.S. Gulf coast margins fell to their lowest level in 18 months as oil products lagged gains in crude. As in Europe, falling gasoline prices more than counteracted firmer distillates.</p>
<p>Margins in Singapore running Dubai crude rose, mostly due to gasoil and fuel prices. They were also supported by a less pronounced fall in gasoline prices, than in Europe and the U.S. In the second half of the month margins fell slowly amid rising crude prices and stagnating product prices.</p>
<p>In August refinery throughputs rose 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 33.5 million bpd in the countries of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>Increases of 400,000 bpd in Japan and 50,000 bpd in the U.S. and Australasia were partly offset by a fall of 100,000 bpd in Europe.</p>
<p>Despite falling in Europe to just below 12.7 million bpd, this was the highest August level in 8 years. Despite a drop of 50,000 bpd to 14.40 million bpd in the United States, the August level was some 100,000 bpd above year ago levels.</p>
<p>Refinery utilisation rose to 96.9 percent in August, almost 2 percent higher that the level a year earlier.</p>
<p>A five percent yeayr-on-year increase on the Gulf Coast was offset by falls on the East and West coast.</p>
<p>Japanese throughputs rose 400,000 bpd to almost 4.4 million bpd as some refiners came bnack from maintenance shutdowns.</p>
<p>In September throughputs are though to have fallen slightly in Europe and to a larger extent in Japan in line with more seasonal maintenance.</p>
