<p>The White House said on Wednesday it was pleased that President Clinton's budget proposal was being treated seriously by Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly expect criticism. We certainly expect alternative ideas to come forward,&quot; said White House spokesman Mike McCurry. &quot;But the most encouraging thing to the president is that this budget is being received seriously and it clearly will be the basis of further discussions on the Hill. It is not being cast aside as a document dead on arrival.&quot;  </p>
<p>Clinton Thursday presented a $1.69 trillion budget that would cut $98.4 billion in taxes over five years, raise $76 billion in various taxes and fees, yet still reach balance by 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he has made a good-faith effort here to write a credible balanced-budget plan,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>Told that some Republicans had called the Clinton plan a &quot;Republican budget,&quot; McCurry said: &quot;It's a balanced budget. And balanced budget now is not Republican or Democratic, it's a bipartisan goal.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton's budget forecast a 1998 deficit of $120.6 billion against 1997's $125.6 billion, gradually shrinking over the next three years and becoming a $17 billion surplus in 2002.</p>
