<p>UK traded options business dried up by early afternoon on Wednesday as underlying stocks failed to generate much follow-through activity, dealers said.</p>
<p>Some general interest was shown in banks although satellite television company British Sky Broadcasting attracted the biggest deal.</p>
<p>This was the purchase of around 2,500 June 600 puts at prices between 18p and 20p, some of which was sold in a crossed trade. The company announced slightly weaker than expected third quarter pre-tax profits of 81.6 million stg.</p>
<p>By 1420 GMT, BSkyB shares were up 8p to 603-1/2p.</p>
<p>In the banking sector, National Westminster Bank was wanted by one trader buying puts and calls in a strangle strategy expecting share price volatility to increase so that option premiums will rise and the position can then be sold at a profit.</p>
<p>The deal was to buy around 300 July 750 puts at 20p as well as 300 July 800 calls at 24p. NatWest shares gained 13p to 764p.</p>
<p>Dealers were talking of a similar volatility deal waiting to be struck in HSBC Holdings. HSBC shares were up 4p to 705-1/2p.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there was a buyer of 250 May 550 calls at 2p in confectionery and soft drinks group Cadbury Schweppes which was prompted by market chatter of a bid for the company. The underlying shares added 5-1/2p to 522p.</p>
<p>And over in supermarket chain J Sainsbury, one trader bought 250 July 360 calls at 7p, after the company had announced full year results slightly better than expected. The pre-tax, pre-exceptional profit came in at 651 million stg.</p>
<p>Sainsbury shares added 3-1/2p to 349-1/2p.</p>
