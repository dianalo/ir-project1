<title>EGYPT: Palestine map in Egyptian press upsets Israelis.</title>

<p>The Israeli embassy in Cairo said on Wednesday it was complaining to the Egyptian government newspaper al-Ahram about a map of the Middle East which ignores Israel and replaces it with Palestine in its pre-1948 borders.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very surprised. In spite of all the political difficulties we are going through, we don't understand how they can publish such a map,&quot; said embassy spokesman Lior Ben-Dor.</p>
<p>The map accompanies an article on plans to link Egypt's electricity grid with those of other Arab countries and export Egyptian electricity to them. Israel is not part of the scheme.</p>
<p>The source of the map was not evident but Ben-Dor said he was confident it came from an Egyptian agency. The relevant editor at al-Ahram was not available to comment.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sending a letter to (al-Ahram editor-in-chief) Ibrahim Nafie and we will take the necessary steps to correct what has to be corrected,&quot; Ben-Dor said.</p>
<p>Ben-Dor said the embassy did not recall similar maps in the Egyptian government press in recent times though old ones do turn up occasionally on the walls of government ministries.</p>
<p>The Israeli embassy has complained to publishers in Egypt in the past about attempts to conceal Israel's existence. It asked one privately published Cairo street guide to mark the Israeli embassy but the editor refused.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained about the Egyptian press on Tuesday. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak says he has no control over what the papers publish.</p>
<p>&quot;The Egyptian government also is leading a line of incessant incitement in the Egyptian press -- including anti-Semitic caricatures which are impossible to describe,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>Egyptian cartoonists frequently mark their Israeli characters with swastikas -- a reference to the Arab view that Zionism and Nazi racism have close similarities.</p>
