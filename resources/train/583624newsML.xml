<title>UK: New UK government to focus aid effort on poverty.</title>
<headline>New UK government to focus aid effort on poverty.</headline>

<p>Britain's international development minister on Wednesday promised a ruthless focus on poverty in the new Labour Government's aid efforts, and signalled her determination to avoid links with the arms trade.</p>
<p>Clare Short, whose appointment as a cabinet minister has already heightened the profile of Britain's aid programme, said she planned the first White Paper, or policy document, on the subject for 22 years.</p>
<p>This would make clear the new government's determination to avoid incidents, such as the row over aid to Malaysia's Pergau Dam, which embarrassed the outgoing Conservative administration.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no more Pergaus. Our intention is to focus ruthlessly on poverty -- getting all children into education and providing clean water and primary health care for all,&quot; Short said in a statement.</p>
<p>In 1994, a court ruled that the government acted unlawfully in authorising 234 million pounds ($379 million) in aid for the Pergau dam project.</p>
<p>The government admitted the aid became &quot;entangled&quot; with a one billion pound sale of British arms to Malaysia in 1988.</p>
<p>Short said her presence in the cabinet -- her Conservative predecessor Baroness Lynda Chalker was a junior minister -- was &quot;a statement of intent that the Government will put world development at the heart of its work&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Isolated acts of charity are not enough. I don't want to play Lady Bountiful. I intend to make a permanent difference,&quot; Short, one of the most left-wing members of Prime Minister Tony Blair's government said.</p>
