<p>President Boris Yeltsin, taking another step toward abolishing the death penalty, ordered the Russian foreign ministry on Friday to sign an article of the global human rights convention outlawing capital punishment.</p>
<p>He also ordered the justice ministry to work out measures needed to put this into practice &quot;step by step&quot;, according to the text of the order issued by the Kremlin press service. The order set no timetable for the abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p>A justice ministry official told Reuters the signing of Article 6 of the Human Rights Convention did not mean an immediate reprieve for at least 500 currently on death row after Yeltsin's new Kremlin team began an informal moratorium last August.</p>
<p>&quot;Before abolishing the death penalty, parliament has to change the law, in particular the new criminal code which came into effect on January 1. This reduced the number of capital crimes from about 30 to five,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;President Yeltsin's order may mean that things will move a little faster&quot;, she added.</p>
<p>The head of the presidential commission on pardons told Itar-Tass news agency on Friday that Yeltsin's order was in line with Russia's commitment to its promises and &quot;makes our state more lawful and defends the rights of citizens&quot;.</p>
<p>Anatoly Pristavkin, respected writer and long time campaigner against the death penalty, told Reuters earlier this month that Russia has not carried out a single execution since May 1996 meeting its promise to the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The commission groups 15 people, including writers, journalists and lawyers, and it reviews all possible pardons, not just those involving death penalty. It can recommend that Yeltsin pardon the convicts.</p>
<p>Pristavkin has said 53 death sentences were carried out in the first half of last year and nobody was pardoned. In 1995 five people were pardoned and 86 were executed.</p>
<p>Pristavkin has said 501 people were now on the death row of Russian prisons. The interior ministry has put the number at up to 700.</p>
<p>Russia undertook to get rid of capital punishment within three years when it joined the Council of Europe a year ago.</p>
<p>But the move has been hotly contested by the interior ministry, which faces a mounting crime wave. The finance ministry is also unhappy about the prospective cost of maintaining prisoners on life sentences.</p>
<p>Pristavkin has said that conditions in the Russian prisons were so appalling that about 20 percent on convicts sentenced to life imprisonment appealed to the commission asking to be executed in a Soviet-style single shot in the head.</p>
<p>The convicts have said they preferred death to endless inprisonment even with vague prospects of freedom in the distant future.</p>
<p>On Friday Pristavkin warned, however, that pushing abolition through the opposition-dominated State Duma lower house of parliament would be very difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;This law must absolutely be passed. Our country must give up murder as soon as possible, particularly since it has never been of benefit to society,&quot; he said.</p>
