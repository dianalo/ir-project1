<p>The potential for a burst of inflation in the nation's economy is rising and may soon require interest-rate rises to head it off, an International Monetary Fund study said Monday.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department issued findings -- sometimes critical -- of an IMF team that spent several weeks in May and June in meetings with U.S. officials including Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>The IMF praised U.S. economic policy management but expressed concern the United States may soon lose the benefits from low wage rises and an appreciating dollar that have kept inflation low.</p>
<p>&quot;At this juncture, a major immediate policy issue is to safeguard against the emergence of inflationary pressures and to prolong the life of the current economic expansion,&quot; the IMF said.</p>
<p>It said the economy was running near its peak operating capacity and said policy-makers at the Fed, the nation's central bank, must &quot;remain vigilant and ... be prepared to raise interest rates further in coming months.&quot;</p>
<p>The IMF added that &quot;a forward-looking approach&quot; by Fed policy-makers was the best way to sustain a six-year-old expansion and to prevent it falling victim to inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;In the IMF staff's view, such an approach is likely to call for a moderate tightening of monetary conditions in the near future,&quot; the statement said. Fed policy-makers are to meet July 1-2 to consider their next move on rates. They raised short-term rates in March, the first increase in more than two years, in a bid to ward off inflation.</p>
<p>Treasury pointed out that it was the U.S. decision to release the IMF statement, adding that several other of the G7 industrial countries also do so. The G7 includes the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not agree with every point in the statement,&quot; Rubin said in a statement. He did not specify the points of disagreement.</p>
<p>Rubin added that the decision by Treasury to issue the IMF statement &quot;underscores our strong commitment to enhancing the transparency of IMF activities&quot; and to building support for its role in making sure the world economy runs smoothly.</p>
<p>The IMF offered a number of criticisms of U.S. policy along with recommendations for action.</p>
<p>It said lowering the trade deficit and the federal debt &quot;should be an important medium-term objective.&quot; It also said measures to boost savings should be enacted.</p>
<p>It praised the pact between Congress and the White House to balance the budget by 2002 and keep it in balance through 2007.</p>
<p>The IMF also said U.S. world leadership was suffering because American contributions to developing countries were shrinking as a percentage of total national output.</p>
