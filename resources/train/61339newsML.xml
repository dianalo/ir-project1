<p>Although the vast majority of funds have neglected metals as an investment, the desire for diversified portfolios may push them towards commodities, AIG Trading vice president Oscar Bleetstein said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if (funds invest in metals) to a small extent, the immense size of today's fund money is likely to have a profound impact on metal prices,&quot; he said told the Asia Gold Congress.</p>
<p>According to a ranking by the magazine Institutional Investor, 300 of the largest pension funds manage total assets of US$9 trillion, up 25 percent from a year ago, he noted.  </p>
<p>Bleestein contrasted that figure with the gold market where, as of last Friday, the dollar value of all COMEX and TOCOM open positions combined totalled about $12 billion.</p>
<p>Between 600 and 800 hedge funds, structured to be exempt from securities laws, manage an estimated US$100 billion, according a 1995 survey by Baron's, he added.</p>
<p>The gold market views fund activity as being at the heart of most major price moves and even the lack of movement is now attributed to a drop in fund activity, Bleetstein said, noting that the traditional coupling of gold and inflation had largely ended in developed economies.  </p>
<p>&quot;While only a small fraction of these entities have more than a token investment in metals,&quot; Bleestein said, &quot;the broad mandates that investors typically allow hedge fund managers often enables them to take positions in metals when and how they feel it opportune.&quot;</p>
<p>Although the top 20 hedge funds were reported to have lost more than $45 billion in financial markets in 1994, so far in 1996 they seem to be making a comeback, Bleestein said.</p>
<p>&quot;In particular, the smaller (under US$80 million), niche or sector-specific funds in mid-cap companies, oil and energy stocks and yes, some gold funds are doing well,&quot; he noted.  </p>
<p>Pension funds -- traditionally the largest funds -- tend to look at gold investments warily, with a survey showing only two percent planned to invest a fraction of their contributions in commodities, Bleestein said.</p>
<p>But an explosive growth in pension funds with massive amounts of new capital to invest, it was reasonable to expect that some of the new money would find its way to commodities, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What is uncertain is to what degree these pension funds will use commodities within a diversified portfolio, rather than simply as a safe haven from inflation,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;Since CTAs tend to move collectively and simultaneously, they tend to amplify price volatility and the market impact of their trading style makes them more significant than their collective size would indicate.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA) -- defined as a person or firm given an investor's limited power of attorney to trade equity -- were thought to manage about $21 billion, according to one estimate, Bleestein said.</p>
<p>CTAs tend to have a shorter-term view of the market, he said, adding that a single CTA could manage several diverse funds investing in energy, gold, soft commodities and foreign exchange.  </p>
