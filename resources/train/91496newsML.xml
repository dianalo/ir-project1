<p>The head of the European Commission's public health and safety directorate, William Hunter, told the European Parliament on Wednesday his unit was ill-equipped to tackle the risk to humans of mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Fernando Mansito, a deputy director general for agriculture at the Commission, also told the parliament's committee of inquiry into Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) that his services did not have the resources to fight the disease.</p>
<p>Commission director general for agriculture Guy Legras had complained to the committee on Tuesday that initially there were only 12 EU veterinary inspectors, which made it impossible to carry out adequate controls in member states.</p>
<p>Hunter was asked by the committee to explain why in 1994 he had overruled a recommendation from one of his senior officials to let Germany ban imports of British beef because of the risk of Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (CJD), the human equivalent of BSE.</p>
<p>A letter from the head of Hunter's public health unit in 1994 had provoked controversy by warning, &quot;From a public health point of view, the measures proposed by Germany should not be rejected by the Commission.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Its responsability could legitimately be called into question in future if it was discovered that BSE can be transmitted to humans from eating beef.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commission refused the German request after Hunter said his service had promised to fund action on CJD from a forthcoming programme on rare diseases, which is still at the drafting stage.</p>
<p>&quot;I said 'If we're going to be serious about CJD then we have to have it in the rare diseases programme.' That was the context of my remark,&quot; Hunter told the committee.</p>
<p>He said his directorate was desperately short of money to deal with public health questions and had little power to act.</p>
<p>It was only since March, 1996, when the British government announced a possible link between BSE and a new strain of CJD, that the Commission's public health service had really started to take a &quot;great interest&quot; in the issue, Hunter said.</p>
<p>Before that time, BSE was deemed to be an animal health problem and responsibility for tackling it had lain almost exclusively with the Commission's directorate for agriculture, he added.</p>
<p>Mansito complained to Euro-MPs that his services lacked the necessary resources or power properly to tackle BSE.</p>
<p>Faced with a chronic shortage of veterinary inspectors, the Commission had concentrated on obligatory controls relating to diseases which posed a serious, immediate risk to human health.</p>
<p>BSE did not fall into that category and EU ministers had not even asked the Commission to give more priority to BSE-related inspections until 1994, Mansito said.</p>
<p>But committe chairman Reimer Boege said the parliament had asked the Commission to be more active in tackling BSE as early as 1990.</p>
<p>Mansito rejected accusations that the Commission had not taken the crisis seriously enough.</p>
<p>It had proposed removing all cattle tissue from the human food chain as early as 1990 but the member states' veterinary experts had not accepted the idea, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems logical to heed what the scientists say,&quot; Mansito said in reply to fierce questioning.</p>
<p>The Spaniard told Euro-MPs he had never suggested that the experts should avoid discussing the danger of BSE because it would undermine the beef market and remarks he had made to Britain's chief veterinary officer in 1993 had probably been mistranslated.</p>
<p>&quot;I said it wasn't really necessary to organise meetings of the Standing Veterinary Committee just to notify people of the number of new cases of BSE,&quot; Mansito said. &quot;I said wouldn't it be good for this disease to be eradicated.&quot;</p>
<p>The committee intends to call on former Commission President Jacques Delors and two former European Farm Commissioners, Ray MacSharry and Rene Steichen to testify.</p>
<p>&quot;It comes back to political responsibility every time,&quot; Boege told the committee.</p>
<p>The German chairman said it was unacceptable for British farm minister Douglas Hogg to refuse to attend the committee's next meeting on October 8, sending permanent secretary Richard Packer in his place.</p>
<p>Basically the blame can be laid squarely at the door of the (British) government. It would not make sense to hear a civil servant when we are talking about political decision,&quot; Boege concluded.</p>
