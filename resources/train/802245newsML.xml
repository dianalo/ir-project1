<p>The Malaysian ringgit staged a sharp recovery against the U.S. dollar on Friday, after earlier hitting its lowest level since the currency was officially floated in 1973, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>Fresh speculative selling by offshore players pushed the ringgit across the critical 2.80 psychological barrier to a record low of 2.8250 to the dollar on Friday, down 2.2 percent against Thursday's close of 2.7650 in Kuala Lumpur, and 13 percent down from 2.5000 a month ago.</p>
<p>The currency recovered to 2.7780 by 1000 GMT Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the selling came out of Singapore. Volume is thin which makes it easy to move the market,&quot; a dealer with a European bank in Singapore said.</p>
<p>Dealers said a sharp fall in the Indonesian rupiah had triggered fresh sales of the ringgit and other regional currencies.</p>
<p>The rupiah dropped to a new record low of 2,960 to the dollar on Friday, a day after the central Bank of Indonesia allowed it to float.</p>
<p>The ringgit, like the Thai baht, the Philippine peso and the rupiah, have been hit by speculative attacks over the past month.</p>
<p>Rumours that Thailand would lift its two-tier exchange rate system at the weekend also pressured regional currencies, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing is, liquidity is currently very thin. As such, even when the movement is huge, the amount that has gone through may be small. Thin markets give room to impact trading, which in turn gives rise to huge gyrations,&quot; said another Singapore dealer.</p>
<p>The ringgit recovery was accompanied by talk that the central Bank Negara had intervened directly in the market. This could not be confirmed because the central bank does not normally comment on its open market operations.</p>
<p>Dealers said there were large corporate sales of dollars at 2.8100/50, and the fact that some of these were done by agent banks of Bank Negara made it look as though it was central bank intervention.</p>
<p>Analysts said the worst might not be over because regional currencies remained under pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that the 2.80-level has given way, many expect the general trend to continue to the upside, especially now that the dollar is also showing strength against the major currencies,&quot; said an analyst with a foreign research firm.</p>
<p>&quot;The contagion effect continues to have a strong effect and that's why it's hard to call a top for now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Technically, the next resistance level was 2.8600, he said.</p>
<p>The final blow that could happen in the region would be the removal of capital controls in Thailand, said Ishak Ismail, markets analyst at I.D.E.A.</p>
<p>&quot;In the event of that, we are likely to see another round of attacks before the whole event wraps up to a close gradually,&quot; he said. -- Kuala Lumpur newsroom 603-201 4813; Fax-603-232 6752</p>
