<headline>S&amp;P assigns Imperial Re BBB plus claims-paying.</headline>
<text>
<p>LONDON, June 23 - Standard &amp; Poor's today has assigned its triple-B'-plus claims-paying ability rating to The Imperial Fire &amp; Marine Re-Insurance Company Ltd. (&quot;Imperial Re&quot;).</p>
<p>The rating is based predominantly on Imperial Re's superior current and prospective capital adequacy. The other positive factors are a strong and conservative management team with a good track record and very strong relationships with major brokers.</p>
<p>These factors are offset by a lack of demonstrable business position and a lack of earnings history, which reflects a virtual start-up company. While the company has a credible business plan which, if substantially delivered in practice, would be likely to result in a higher rating level, a higher rating at this early stage in its development is precluded.</p>
<p>The company was acquired by its Chief Executive, Loay Al-Naqib, from Aetna Life and Casualty on July 26, 1996. From its base in the London reinsurance market, the company plans to grow into emerging markets.</p>
<p>MAJOR RATING FACTORS:</p>
<p>-- Current and prospective capitalization is superior. Standard &amp; Poor's estimates that capital adequacy would be unlikely to fall below 250% of risk-based capital requirements before the year 2000, a level consistent with a triple-A' rating. All other things being equal, the company could sustain 35 additional loss ratios percentage points throughout this period and still maintain capital adequacy at a level consistent with a triple-B' rating.</p>
<p>	    -- The chief executive has assembled a strong and</p>
<p>conservative management team, which is overseen by a Board which consists of experienced executive and non-executive insurance professionals and which applies strong corporate governance practices. The underwriting teams inherited from Aetna Re achieved satisfactory historic results and the company has recruited senior underwriters to enter new lines of business. The chief executive's commitment is evidenced by his personal financial stake in the business.</p>
<p>	    -- In view of the short period since the company's</p>
<p>change of management, it has very little track record. However for the lines of business which are being retained by Imperial Re from Aetna Re (London Market property facultative and property excess of loss), the results achieved were satisfactory over a long period. Similarly the new underwriters for the aviation, marine, and European property facultative businesses have excellent industry credentials.</p>
<p>-- The company has a credible business plan which it will have to demonstrate. So far as the continuing lines of business are concerned the company wrote only US$19 million of gross premiums in 1996. These lines are highly competitive and Standard &amp; Poor's expects growth to be moderate, since the company lacks competitive advantage. European Facultative business will be written for the first time in the latter part of 1997 where the company is expected to enjoy some competitive advantage. Standard &amp; Poor's also believes that the company's plans to grow via Middle East and Far East branches are promising, and that over the long term such branch business is likely to dominate the company's profile. Although the company's current business position has not yet been fully established in the market, and such a company would not normally expect strong ties to the broking community, Standard &amp; Poor's believes that Imperial Re's management enjoys unusually strong broker relationships which should facilitate the c</p>
<p>EXPECTATIONS:</p>
<p>-- Continuing superior capitalization: in excess of 250% of risk- based requirements for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>-- Premium growth of the London operations averaging 40% per annum, but remaining small in relation to other London Market companies.</p>
<p>-- Branch offices in Far East and Middle East operational in the latter part of 1997 and contributing a steadily increasing proportion of the company's portfolio thereafter.</p>
<p>-- Moderate earnings but growing consistently thereafter as it grows into its expense base, Standard &amp; Poor's said.</p>
