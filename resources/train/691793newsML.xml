<p>Overall base metal activity on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was fairly nondescript on Friday, although zinc reached a new 6-3/4 year high, while nickel slumped to a 6-1/2 month low.</p>
<p>Traders said zinc continued to build on the speculative buying seen so far in the current bull-run, helped by clearing $1,420 - the previous high - and then $1,426.</p>
<p>&quot;It continues to go up, I don't know where the buying is coming from, but you just can't buck it (the trend),&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Prices peaked at $1,430 a tonne before settling at $1,428, up $16 from Thursday's kerb close.</p>
<p>Nickel belatedly reacted to overnight news of a tentative deal at Inco's strike-bound Sudbury mine, and fell below $7,000, triggering some sell-stops down to a low of $6,930.</p>
<p>Some support is expected around $6,900, so prices edged off the lows to end at $6,970, still $100 lower.</p>
<p>Copper business was transacted within a comparatively tight $28 range, with the market absorbing a mini sell-off down to a $2,400 low.</p>
<p>The spreads remains tight ahead of next Wednesday's July options declarations, so the market will remain nervous in the short-term. Last trade was at $2,418, up $20.</p>
<p>Aluminium tended to mirror copper's movements, and edged up from mid-afternoon lows, finishing at $1,575, down just $2.</p>
<p>Lead gained from a late burst of buying, probably spill-over sentiment from zinc, and closed at $630, up $9. Tin was dull, and closed just $10 higher at $5,560, while alloy was steady at $1,450/60.</p>
