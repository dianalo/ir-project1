<headline>UK's CrestCo appoints Royal Bank executive.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>The head of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc's share registrar unit has been appointed to the board of CrestCo, which operates the London stock market's computerised system for recording the ownership of UK equities.</p>
<p>The appointment of the Royal Bank's Julian Leiper is potentially significant since it comes ahead of next month's flotation of the Halifax Building Society, the largest UK flotation ever, to which the bank is registrar.</p>
<p>Flotations such as the Halifax and the recent market debut of Alliance &amp; Leicester Plc, have been regarded as a key test of the capacity of the Crest system, which came into operation last year.</p>
<p>Initially Crest ran into criticism for backlogs in processing the ownership of shares and the operation has recently extended its opening times to give brokers more time to input deals.</p>
<p>Iain Saville, CrestCo chief executive, said Leiper's appointment &quot;will be very valuable to CrestCo as the market deals with the challenges of a busy programme of demutualisations this year.&quot;</p>
<p>However, a spokesman for the Royal Bank played down a direct link with the Halifax float, saying the appointment was due to no more than a general desire for a major share registrar to be represented on the CrestCo board.</p>
