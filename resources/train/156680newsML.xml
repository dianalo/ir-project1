<headline>Malaysian govt not a stupid investor - Mahathir.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-10-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Thursday his government did not invest stupidly in foreign projects as presumed by some critics, and had scored some major business coups overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not as stupid as we're thought to be,&quot; Mahathir told reporters.</p>
<p>A member of parliament this week questioned whether the state investment agency Khazanah Nasional had taken too much risk in backing the YTL Corp bid to buy a Hong Kong power company.</p>
<p>Khazanah had agreed to provide a $1 billion loan to YTL, a state-run infrastructure and power company, to buy a controlling stake in Hong Kong's Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd (CEPA) But YTL said on Tuesday that the deal, which would have cost it a total of $2.6 billion, was aborted.</p>
<p>Mahathir defended Khazanah, saying the firm had calculated its risk in the deal and even planned to be a substantial shareholder in CEPA in return for the loan extended to YTL.</p>
<p>&quot;If this had happened, we'd be in control of a giant power firm represented in countries such as Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Pakistan,&quot; said Mahathir.</p>
<p>&quot;Give us some faith, please,&quot; he added. &quot;There are lots of things we do that appear stupid but aren't actually. This was one good deal that got away.&quot;</p>
