<p>Britain's opposition Labour Party is willing to consider jettisoning the pound sterling and joining a European single currency in 1999 given the right circumstances, economics spokesman Gordon Brown said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the economic conditions are right, we will retain the option of joining the single currency in the next parliament and in the first wave,&quot; Brown said in Washington.</p>
<p>Brown's statement followed ructions within the Conservative party after Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Wednesday that the government was &quot;on balance hostile&quot; to a single currency.</p>
<p>Finance minister Kenneth Clarke, the most pro-European member of Prime Minister John Major's cabinet, reacted to this apparent breach of the government's agreed &quot;wait and see&quot; line by saying Rifkind must have made a slip of the tongue.</p>
<p>Labour is poised to return to power for the first time since 1979 in a general election which is expected to be held in Britain on May 1. The party was 18 points ahead of the Conservatives in the latest opinion poll.</p>
<p>Many Conservatives believe their party's only chance of snatching an election victory would be for them to come out against a single currency and mount a patriotic defence of the pound as a symbol of Britain's sovereignty.</p>
<p>But Brown, speaking at a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, said: &quot;I do not believe that a single currency is a threat to the nation state.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No sensible Chancellor (of the Exchequer) should close down options, particularly if asked to do so for reasons of dogma, especially in an area where you have 60 percent of your trade and where 3.5 million jobs depend on it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;Getting it right is, of course, more important than getting it quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>The text of his statement was issued in London.</p>
<p>Brown said any decision about British membership should take into account not just the economic criteria laid down in the European Union's Maastricht Treaty but &quot;our own British economic tests.&quot;</p>
<p>He said in taking the decision, Labour would want to examine the likely impact on investment in Britain, the effect on the financial services industry, whether EU countries were at different stages of the economic cycle, whether there was enough flexibility to respond to problems, and the impact on jobs.</p>
<p>Brown also repeated Labour's pledge to submit any proposal to join a single currency to a national referendum.</p>
