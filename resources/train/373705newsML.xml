<headline>Swedish 5-yr bond expected to be well received.</headline>

<p>A new five-year bond, issued by Sweden's National Debt Office on Wednesday, was expected to attract good attention in the market, especially with an offer to make exchanges on other loans in the market.</p>
<p>The bond, Loan 1039, which matures on April 12, 2002, will pay coupon interest of 5.5 percent and has benchmark status.</p>
<p>The office is to auction two billion crowns ($268.8 million) worth of the new paper at 1150 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers were expecting a good reception but said this could be affected by a union/government news conference on unemployment benefits being held at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems we have a reasonably strong market, and that segment is well bid today,&quot; economist Knut Hallberg from Swedbank told Reuters.</p>
<p>To improve the liquidity of the five-year bond, the debt office has invited investors to make exchanges.</p>
<p>Investors can sell Loan 1028, which matures in January 1999, and buy Loan 1039 for the same nominal amount to enable the debt office to facilitate the refinancing of Loan 1028.</p>
<p>Or investors who do not want to increase the interest sensitivity of their portfolios the chance to exchange a combination of Loan 1028 and Loan 1035 that matures in 2005 for the new five-year loan.</p>
<p>The exchange transaction can be conducted between February 17 and March 7.</p>
<p>Economists said this was the third time the debt office has given investors the opportunity to exchange an existing loan on the market.</p>
<p>The first was in late 1995 and the second was in connection with the new 10-year benchmark bond last October.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market is more used to the idea now, and it won't cause the problems and nervousness seen before,&quot; said Tomas Niemela from Aragon Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The first time the market was very nervous about it, but people are getting more accustomed to this arrangement.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it has been successful, and they will keep on doing it.&quot;</p>
<p>Hallberg said a similar offer extended on the new benchmark ten-year bond, Loan 1038, last October was successful. The full exchange transactions were carried out in a matter of hours rather than over the allotted week.</p>
<p>Loan 1038 now had 18.4 billion crowns in outstanding amounts.</p>
<p>&quot;Over half of this is from swtiching from other loans,&quot; Hallberg said.</p>
