<title>SWEDEN: Swedish yields rise on weak crown.</title>
<headline>Swedish yields rise on weak crown.</headline>

<p>Swedish debt yields opened lower but ended higher on Tuesday  on a weakening crown and higher international yields.</p>
<p>&quot;These are sensitive levels. Some countries in Europe are at a record low at the moment,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The yields rose on weaker international markets and a weakening crown against the mark.&quot;</p>
<p>Six month T-bill rates rose six basis points to 4.01 percent. The ten year bond yield rose seven to 6.64 percent.</p>
<p>One dealer said he was amazed yields opened down in the morning seeing the weakness of the crown.  </p>
<p>The crown weakened on a weaker Italian lira as well as on general concerns about EMU, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar came down under the 1.70-level against the mark which made the crown weaker against the mark. The Riksbank decision to keep its repo rate unchanged at 4.10 percent might have pushed the crown down,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The crown weakened to 4.3910 crowns to the mark versus 4.3645 crowns late on Monday.</p>
<p>The Riksbank presented December current account data which was below expectations at a surplus of 0.9 billion crowns against expectations of 2.1 billion.  </p>
<p>Foreign interest payments were said to have impacted on the surplus.</p>
<p>Dealers said the focus for the market on Wednesday would be the U.S. Consumer Price Index and trade balance.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade balance will be interesting because it will show the direction of the dollar,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
