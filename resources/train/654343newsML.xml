<p>U.S. Plains cattle traded in light volume early Wednesday at $63.00 per cwt, unchanged from Tuesday's brisk activity, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 1,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area following about 20,000 on Tuesday, they said. Week to date movement Wednesday was pegged near 75,000 there.</p>
<p>There were no reported sales in Kansas, with some bids at $62.00 to $63.00 passed by owners seeking $63.00 to $64.00, sources there said. Sales Tuesday in Kansas were near 50,000 head, which brought the weekly movement to about 65,000, they said.  </p>
<p>Tuesday's active trade sold out showlists at some feedlots but owners lost about $10.00 to $35.00 per head to remain current, several feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Beef continued to move well, but packers keep discounting prices to get the job done, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no incentive to keep the beef price up as long as they can buy cattle cheaper,&quot; a Panhandle source said.</p>
<p>Beef prices Tuesday tumbled $1.03 to $1.86 per cwt, with 361 fabricated loads reported sold, USDA said. Heavyweight choice beef was down $1.28 at $99.63, the lowest since April 9, USDA statistics showed.</p>
