<p>The dollar was firm, though off peaks, in late Europe after a rise in U.S. inflation bolstered speculation for a rise in interest rates, said analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers, very slightly, increase the chances of the Fed raising rates next Tuesday,&quot; said Dick Howard, director of economic research at Julius Baer Investments.</p>
<p>Market speculation of a rate rise at the policy setting Federal Open Market Committee on March 25 has been simmering for some time and has been partly responsible for the dollar's underlying strength. At 1605 GMT the dollar stood at 1.6814/19 marks vs 1.6726/36.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar ended its European session near unchanged at 122.71/2.76 yen vs 122.43 yen in late Europe on Tuesday.</p>
<p>February headline CPI rose 0.3 percent, above forecasts for an 0.2 percent rise, while the core figure ex-food and energy was up 0.2 percent as expected.</p>
<p>The dollar initially dipped on the figure as it tracked U.S. bonds lower and economists said while the Fed is likely to raise rates next week, it is not inflation which will drive that move.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation continues to move along at a pretty subdued pace,&quot; said Howard. Analysts said Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated, for instance, that other factors, such as labour market conditions and growth are more important to Fed monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth was very strong in the fourth-quarter and first-quarter and certainly well-above trend. I think the Fed will be concerned that growth will be a bit too strong,&quot; said Howard.</p>
<p>But currency markets are on alert for a pre-emptive strike by the Fed to curb the risk of potential inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic problem is the market's fear of a pre-emptive move by the Fed which means the market can't relax,&quot; said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN-Amro in London.</p>
<p>The dollar's upside momentum was slightly capped against the mark after Germany's Ifo institute February business climate index came in at 93.6 against 93.3 in January, helping to offset some of the gloom over the German economy.</p>
<p>Germany's M3 growth, however, slowed to 9.6 pct vs Q4 1996 and 11.7 percent in January.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in currency markets, sterling/mark moved higher to end the European session above 2.68 marks after UK February unemployment fell 68,200 with the unemployment rate running at 6.2 percent vs 6.5 percent in January.</p>
