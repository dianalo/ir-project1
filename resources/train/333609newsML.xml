<title>DUBAI: Dubai gold prices lower, demand slow to emerge.</title>

<p>Lower gold prices and the closing weeks of the Islamic holy fasting month of Ramadan in the Gulf Arab re-export centre of Dubai have yet to drive demand for bullion or jewellery higher, Dubai traders said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Dubai's benchmark Ten Tola bar -- 3.746 ounces of 24-carat gold -- was quoted by traders at 4,880 UAE dirhams ($1,329) on Sunday, down from 4,913 ($1,339) on January 19.</p>
<p>The Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of Ramadan is due in the Gulf around February 10 and is traditionally an auspicious time for buying precious metal in the oil region.</p>
<p>But traders said that the rally in silver prices last week had partly dented local retail demand.</p>
<p>&quot;People were looking for lower prices and were undecided at that point. But suddenly the silver price went up and this has halted interest,&quot; said one wholesaler in Dubai.</p>
<p>Silver was last quoted on Friday at $4.97-99 an ounce, a three-month high which helped gold consolidate above 40-month lows. Gold was last quoted on Saturday at $352.70-$353.20.</p>
<p>Silver was sparked higher by U.S. investment funds.</p>
<p>Demand from the main Indian import market was steady because of continued wedding demand and rules adopted at the start of this year which increased the amnount of gold that non-resident Indians may take back to India, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The margins into India are still reasonable and the wedding season is there. But it's nothing spectacular,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Strong Indian demand was the main contributing factor behind Dubai's record bullion imports for 1996, traders said.</p>
<p>Bullion imports into the emirate reached a record 350.49 tonnes last year, up from 318.03 tonnes in 1995, the World Gold Council reported last week.</p>
<p>Critical to future of Indian demand would be the value of the Indian rupee against the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of major banks and firms forecast the rupee would weaken by two percent against the dollar in the next six months, making bullion more expensive for Indian importers.</p>
<p>Licensed sales of gold from Dubai into Pakistan resumed on Saturday for the first time in three weeks after Dubai-based ARY Traders received assurance from Islamabad that its licence was still valid.</p>
<p>&quot;It's already on the way...demand (in Pakistan) is strong because of low stocks,&quot; a trader at ARY said.</p>
