<p>Paraguay goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert finally made his mark on the Copa America Tuesday, scoring his first goal of the tournament in a 1-1 draw against his favourite enemies Argentina.</p>
<p>Chilavert took two free kicks, appeared to psyche out Argentina's Marcelo Gallardo, who missed the first of the game's three penalties, and was involved in the incident that led to Pablo Rotchen being sent off.</p>
<p>But Gallardo had the last laugh when he converted a last-minute penalty to send his team into the quarter-finals and force Paraguay to wait and see if they can go through as one of the two best third-placed sides.</p>
<p>Chilavert had been strangely subdued in Paraguay's first two games, the second of which saw the end of a 13-month unbeaten run in an upset by Ecuador.</p>
<p>But the prospect of playing Argentina provided him with the motivation he needed.</p>
<p>Chilavert, who regularly scores from penalties and free kicks, plays his club football in Argentina with Velez Sarsfield and frequently claims that his hosts cannot stomach the fact that a Paraguayan is superior to the homegrown stars.</p>
<p>The last time the sides met -- in a World Cup qualifier last year -- he silenced the River Plate stadium by scoring from a free kick to give his country a 1-1 draw and a priceless away point.</p>
<p>On that occasion he seemed to intimidate the Argentine strikers, and when Gallardo stepped up in the 55th minute of Tuesday's game for his first penalty, the menacing figure of Chilavert again seemed too much.</p>
<p>Gallardo fired his shot horribly high and wide and Chilavert, who will miss next month's return World Cup game in Asuncion through suspension, celebrated aggressively.</p>
<p>He then showed Gallardo how a penalty should be taken, sending his opposite number Carlos Roa the wrong way in the 73rd minute.</p>
<p>But in the dying seconds, Gallardo got it right, blasting his shot into the roof of the net after Argentina had been awarded a second penalty. It was also a clash with the burly Chilavert that led Rotchen to be sent off, having already been booked.</p>
<p>Earlier, Ecuador, the surprise package of the tournament, had beaten an uninspired Chile 2-1 to top group A with seven points. Argentina finished second with five points and Paraguay third with four. Both games were played in Cochabamba at 2,600 metres above sea level.</p>
<p>Paraguay are the only team in the group to have brought a full-strength squad with the other three resting their best players for World Cup qualifiers.</p>
<p>Chile coach Nelson Acosta again criticised the timing of the tournament after his side went home with no points and only one goal in the bag. &quot;We're thinking about the World Cup qualifiers and that is why we brought a second-string team,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In La Paz, the host team finally buried the hatchett with the local media, ending a 10-day feud in which the players refused to give interviews and the Bolivian media refused to attend team training sessions.</p>
<p>The last group B matches take place Wednesday. Bolivia, with six points from two games, meet Uruguay, who have three, in La Paz. Peru, with three points, face pointless Venezuela in Sucre.</p>
<p>The quarter-final line-ups will be completed Thursday in Santa Cruz, the only sea level venue, when Brazil, who lead group C with maximum points, play Colombia, while Mexico meet Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Colombia and Mexico have three points each, while Costa Rica, with a very slim chance of reaching the last eight, has yet to pick up a point.</p>
