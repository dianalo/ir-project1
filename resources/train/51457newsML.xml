<title>MOLDOVA: No bids at Moldovan privatisation tender.</title>
<headline>No bids at Moldovan privatisation tender.</headline>
<dateline>CHISINAU 1996-09-13</dateline>

<p>Moldova's government cancelled on Thursday a tender for controlling stakes in three Moldovan companies, as no foreign or local investors had placed bids ahead of the official deadline of September 12.</p>
<p>Privatisation ministry officials told a news conference late on Thursday that although several foreign investors had made inquiries about the three companies, none of them had decided to take part in the tender.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this is due to summer holidays, when business activity subsides, to lack of finance to promote the project in the West and to the presidential elections in November,&quot; Privatisation ministry department chief Ludmila Buzu said.</p>
<p>The tender was to launch sell-offs of controlling stakes of up to 60 percent in 41 local companies to strategic investors to attract capital to the recession-hit economy.</p>
<p>The government had offered 53 percent of shares in the Codru furniture factory at a starting price of 50 million lei, 60 percent of the Aviatehnologhia plant producing airport equipment worth 15 million lei and 60 percent of shares in the Palas hotel worth seven million lei.</p>
<p>All three units are located in the capital Chisinau, and the authorities had hoped investors would be attracted by the possibility of buying the land of the companies, running to 305 hectares in case of Codru.</p>
<p>The government also wants to increase revenues from privatisation, which have so far been disappointing.</p>
<p>Privatisation revenues were budgeted at 85 million lei but so far this year the Privatisation Ministry has sold 18 minor units, such as shops and incomplete building sites, for a total of only 9.26 million lei.</p>
<p>Despite the failure of the first auction, Privatisation Minister Ceslav Ciobanu told the news conference his ministry and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have selected another five Moldovan companies to be put on the auction block soon.</p>
