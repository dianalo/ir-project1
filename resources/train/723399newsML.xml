<headline>Helsinki gains on Nokia recovery, firm forestries.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1997-07-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A late rebound in Nokia and gains in forestries helped shares end near session highs on Friday, with a higher open for U.S. stocks pointing to further strength next week, brokers said.</p>
<p>The FOX index rose 0.38 percent to 1,162.05, less than five points short of its all-time high July 9 close, while the all-share HEX index gained 0.39 percent to 3,384.29 points.</p>
<p>After sagging for most of the day under the weight of its Thursday losses on Wall Street, Nokia recovered late in the session to end up 1.00 markka at 419.00. Trade in the share was fairly lively with volume rising to 177 million markka.</p>
<p>Brokers said Nokia tracked its Swedish rival Ericsson higher, with news of a two billion crown Taiwanese order for Ericsson GSM infrastructure helping to underpin bullish sentiment towards telecom equipment makers.</p>
<p>Forestries outperformed other issues, with UPM-Kymmene closing up 1.40 markka at 134.50 after setting a new life-high of 135.50 in lively 150 million markka trade. Enso ended 1.30 markka higher at 50.50 after posting a new life-high at 51.00.</p>
<p>&quot;There is global demand for forestry shares,&quot; one broker said. &quot;There's lots of money around, and American investors are buying cyclicals,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>The forestries subindex advanced four percent for the week, helped by gains this week in U.S. forestry shares which rose on restructuring news from heavyweight International Paper and higher Q2 earnings from Georgia-Pacific, brokers said.</p>
<p>Engineering group Partek closed flat at 99.00 markka after heavy-volume trade that stemmed mostly from a single million-share deal crossed inhouse at Carnegie at 100.00 per share.</p>
<p>Financials dragged on the main indices. Merita closed down 0.20 markka at 19.80, and insurer Sampo ended off 2.00 markka at 523.00.</p>
