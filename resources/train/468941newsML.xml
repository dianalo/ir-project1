<p>The supervisory board of Bulgaria's privatisation agency on Wednesday dismissed executive director Vesselin Blagoev but his successor has not been named yet, supervisory board president Iosif Iliev said.</p>
<p>&quot;The agency supervisory board voted at its meeting today to release Blagoev from his post as an executive director and the decision comes into force on March 27,&quot; Iliev said.</p>
<p>Iliev told a news conference deputy executive director Ilia Dimov would be acting executive director until the supervisory board named a replacement, probably next Tuesday. He said the agency's work would not be affected.</p>
<p>Iliev said one of the main motives for Blagoev's sacking was a lack of initiative and flexibility in the privatisation process, as well as a lack of coordination between the agency's executive body and the supervisory board and government.</p>
<p>&quot;Many more resources and possibilities must be used,&quot; Iliev said, adding that problems had piled up which could be solved by a new management.</p>
<p>The caretaker cabinet which took office in mid-February has sacked a number of senior officials appointed by the former Socialist government. Blagoev was appointed in March 1995.</p>
<p>Blagoev denied he had been sacked for political reasons but said he had been unable to convince some members of the former Socialist cabinet of the need to privatise big firms.</p>
