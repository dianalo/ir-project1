<p>Czech President Vaclav Havel summoned government leaders to talks on Tuesday on relations with Germany amid signs that a historic declaration aimed at closing the book on World War Two may be made soon.</p>
<p>Havel will meet Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec, leaders of the two junior coalition partners and opposition Social Democrat chief Milos Zeman on Thursday, said presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek.</p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of this consultation is to assess the current discussions on the Czech-German declaration and to decide on the next steps,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Also invited is Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra, Prague's chief negotiator with Bonn on the declaration, which is supposed to be issued by the Czech and German parliaments.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is the only remaining victim of Nazi occupation not to have come to terms with Germany. Negotiations on the declaration have dragged on for more than a year, bedevilled by political pressures particularly in Germany.</p>
<p>Prague says the text has been completed and the problem now lies with Bonn where members of the Sudeten German community, expelled en masse from the former Czechoslovakia after the war, have made a series of demands holding up the text's approval.</p>
<p>The statement gave no explicit indication that the laborious treaty process was nearing its end. But a road block seemed to disappear last month when Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the dominant figure in German politics, said he hoped it could be signed before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Czech government and moderate opposition agree on the the need to settle the issue, which Sudeten leaders have threatened to use to block Czech ambitions to join the European Union.</p>
<p>The declaration seeks to address Czech memories of the 1938-1945 Nazi occupation and German memories of the indiscriminate expulsion of 2.5 million Sudetens for supporting Hitler, authorised by the victorious World War Two allies.</p>
<p>Havel has said that it was wrong to hold the Sudetens collectively guilty as some -- albeit a minority -- had remained loyal to the democratic Czechoslovak state.</p>
<p>The agreement is also expected to regulate issues of property and compensation for Czech victims of Nazism and the Sudetens. However, Havel has ruled out returning any property confiscated from Sudetens by presidential decree in the 1940s.</p>
