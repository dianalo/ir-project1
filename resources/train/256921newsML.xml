<p>More than 200,000 opposition supporters on Saturday held the biggest ever demonstration in a month of protests in Belgrade, maintaining pressure on Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to reverse election fraud.</p>
<p>The record-breaking protest coincided with intensified efforts by the West to help end the crisis which began with disputed local elections in mid-November.</p>
<p>&quot;I have never seen such a number of people in the city centre,&quot; a reporter for independent Belgrade radio B92 said, estimating the number of marchers at up to 250,000.</p>
<p>Reporters said it was impossible to gauge the numbers in the crowd due to its sheer size and spillover into side streets, but agreed there were more people than at a similar record-breaking protest on Friday.</p>
<p>Earlier Belgrade students also staged their biggest demonstration in weeks, with reporters estimating up to 40,000 protesters marching through the streets cheered by people lining the pavement or watching from windows and balconies.</p>
<p>Later many of the youthful protesters joined up with the main demonstration.</p>
<p>Serbia's opposition and students have mounted more than three weeks of peaceful street protests since the Zajedno opposition coalition claimed it was cheated of victory in elections in the biggest Serbian cities, including Belgrade.</p>
<p>A column of opposition supporters several kilometres long, blowing trumpets and whistles and accompanied by several gypsy bands, marched through the city, at times 50 abreast.</p>
<p>In a show of discipline requested by the organisers there were no pictures of Zajedno leaders or nationalist symbols.</p>
<p>&quot;We are at the beginning of a long road to the future -- we can discuss the pace at which we will move, but definitely not the direction,&quot; Zajedno leader Zoran Djindjic said.</p>
<p>The tenacity of the protests appeared to dash Milosevic's hopes of sitting out the crisis until the marches faded away.</p>
<p>At their Dublin summit, European Union leaders set conditions for an international team to verify the regularity of last month's polls, including the right to re-run them under international supervision, mediator Carl Bildt said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Under pressure from daily mass street protests, Milosevic offered on Friday to allow the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to send a delegation to check the fairness of the poll.</p>
<p>A declaration adopted at the Dublin summit called on Yugoslavia to &quot;demonstrate full respect for human and minority rights and the observance of democratic norms&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The OSCE will wish to consider the conditions for such a mission, notably in relation to the right to recommend a reversal of the annulments or a rerun of some elections,&quot; the EU said.</p>
<p>The United States on Friday branded Milosevic's offer a whitewash, while the Europeans were more inclined to use it as a potential lever for a democratic transition in Belgrade.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no interest whatsoever in an economic and social collapse of Serbia,&quot; International community High Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt said, but he added: &quot;There is no way that Serbia can remain an enclave (in Europe) of ideas that normally end up on the scrap heap of history.&quot;</p>
<p>Bildt said Milosevic's inability or unwillingness to reform Serbia's economy was the main cause of the current crisis.</p>
<p>Zajedno leaders welcomed the motion for an OSCE team to rule on the results but vowed not to give up their demands.</p>
<p>&quot;A commission from Mars can come and it will find the same thing: that we won on November 17 and that we have no intention of relinquishing that victory,&quot; Djindjic said.</p>
<p>Some EU diplomats were concerned that Milosevic could crack down with his widely-feared police against the demonstrations, which marked their 27th day on Saturday.</p>
<p>But security forces were keeping a low profile on Saturday in line with Milosevic's repeated promises to the West that he would not resort to violence to crush the protests as he did in 1991, when he sent in tanks.</p>
