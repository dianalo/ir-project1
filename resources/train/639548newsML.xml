<title>ROMANIA: Romania's Banc Post seen second bank to go private.</title>
<headline>Romania's Banc Post seen second bank to go private.</headline>

<p>Romania's state-owned Banc Post SA is likely to be the second commercial bank to go private under government reforms, the World Bank resident representative in Bucharest said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was officially agreed that Banc Post is the second to be privatised,&quot; Francois Ettori told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Banc Post was launched in 1992 and conducts savings operations for individuals through post offices across Romania. Its financial results for 1996 and 1995 were not available.</p>
<p>Bank privatisation is one of the main goals of the Romanian government's reforms and a plank to win support from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Romania passed a selloff bill for its six state-run banks and pledged to privatise at least one bank, Banca Romana pentru Dezvoltare SA (BRD) development bank, by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Ettori said Romania should privatise two banks in order to draw the final $100 million tranche of a World Bank Financial and Enterprise Adjustment Loan (FESAL).</p>
<p>&quot;This does not exclude that they might have a third bank privatised this year,&quot; Ettori said.</p>
<p>Farm lender Banca Agricola SA is seen the next potential bank to be privatised.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the World Bank approved a $550 million loan poackage for Romania to underpin farm reforms, social security and road upgrading. A second tranche of $80 million of the $280 million FESAL facility for industry restructuring should be released by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Romania drew a $100 million FESAL tranche last year before the Bank suspended credits over discontent with reforms conducted by the former leftist administration ousted in last November's elections.</p>
