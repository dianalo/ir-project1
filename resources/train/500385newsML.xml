<p>The Taleban administration said on Thursday opposition forces had been defeated in eastern areas of Afghanistan but denied press reports its army had gained territory in the remote northwestern province of Badghis.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no change in the front line in Badghis. There was sporadic exchanges of artillery, rocket and small arms fire, but no heavy fighting,&quot; acting Minister of Information Amir Khan Mutaqi told reporters.</p>
<p>Press reports had quoted Taleban officials as saying their army had taken a number of key positions and advanced up to 10 km (6 miles) in Badghis against the opposition forces of General Abdul Rashid Dostum.</p>
<p>Mutaqi said Taleban forces had foiled attacks by opposition groups in the eastern Afghan provinces of Laghman and Nangarhar.</p>
<p>The two provinces were now totally under the control of Taleban forces, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;In Dawlat Shah district of Laghman the opposiiton had massed troops in preparation for attacks, but our forces foiled their plans and we captured 100 prisoners of war. Similarly in two districts of Nangarhar province our forces ambushed opposition groups. Ten opposition fighters were killed in the fighting.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no independent confirmation of Mutaqi's comments.</p>
<p>Mutaqi blamed the opposition for the incidents, which broke a United Nations-mediated ceasefire that was supposed to last for five days during a polio vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;It was our opponents who launched these attacks and they are the ones who should be condemned by the U.N.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The opposition has not commented on Mutaqi's statements.</p>
<p>The Taleban, who now control some 75 percent of Afghanistan, face an opposition alliance consisting of the ousted government, General Dostum and Shi'ite leader Karim Khalili in the mountains north of Kabul and in Badghis.</p>
