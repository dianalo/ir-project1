<p>South Korean state prosecutors said on Thursday they had indicted President Kim Young-sam's second son on tax evasion and bribery charges.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Kim Hyun-chul had received 6.61 billion won ($7.42 million) from businessmen, of which 3.22 billion was a bribe accepted in exchange for favours.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Kim evaded 1.48 billion won in taxes.</p>
<p>Under Korean law, Kim could be jailed for life for tax evasion. Bribery carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail.</p>
<p>South Korea's &quot;crown prince&quot;, as he is known, was charged with taking kickbacks in return for business favours from two alumni of his old high school, one a former top executive of a construction company.</p>
<p>The May 17 arrest of the president's son dramatically brought to a head a loans-for-kickback scandal involving top politicians, bankers and businessmen that emerged from the rubble of the country's biggest bankruptcy in January.</p>
