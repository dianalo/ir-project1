<headline>Nordbanken says lower credit losses lifts profit.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1996-10-30</dateline>

<p>Swedish state-controlled Nordbanken on Wednesday joined other Swedish banks and said business was back on track, announcing a 13 percent rise in nine-month profits.</p>
<p>Nordbanken reported a nine-month operating profit of 5.74 billion crowns, attributing the increase to better transaction revenues, strongly reduced credit losses and lower operating costs.  </p>
<p>Last month Nordbanken proposed a five billion crown share buy back which could reduce the government's holding to 58 percent from 65.5 percent.</p>
<p>The bank said in its results statement that this had had a positive impact on the share price.</p>
<p>&quot;The share market has received the share buy back proceedings very positively and was behind the positive development of the Nordbanken share compared with the previous quarterly result,&quot; Nordbanken said.</p>
<p>The share traded at 169 crowns after the result, up two crowns on Tuesday's close. The share closed at 135.50 crowns on September 10, the day before the buy back was announced.</p>
<p>Nordbanken said its earnings per share rose by 1.68 crown to 18.77 crowns per share. Loan losses fell to 489 million crowns from 966 million in the first nine months of 1995.  </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the bank priced the 32 million shares in the buy back at 155 crowns. Almost all of the shares involved were owned by the state, and the state's stake was reduced to 59.4 percent from 65.5 percent.</p>
<p>Net profit from financial transactions jumped to 1.03 billion crowns from 366 million crowns. Staff costs rose to 2.12 billion crowns from 2.06 billion, while other costs fell to 2.46 billion from 2.77 billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;A strong net improvement in (income from) financial transactions, sharply reduced loan losses and lower operating costs led to improved results while the interest net worsened,&quot; Nordbanken said.  </p>
<p>It said net interest income fell to 20.80 billion crowns in the period from 22.38 billion crowns.</p>
