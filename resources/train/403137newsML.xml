<headline>3Com, U.S. Robotics deal slightly dilutive. [CORRECTED 01:54 GMT 27/2]</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-26</dateline>

<p>The proposed $6.6 billion merger between 3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp is expected to be slightly dilutive to 3Com's and U.S. Robotics's combined earnings, but any slight dilution will be offset by expected cost savings from the merger, the companies said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you combine the current average earnings estimates (on Wall Street) and recalculate the shares outstanding, you will find some slight dilution (to earnings from the merger),&quot; said Chris Paisley, 3Com's chief financial officer, on a conference call with analysts and reporters.  </p>
<p>On a fully-diluted basis, the merger is worth $7.3 billion, executives said in the call.</p>
<p>3Com said it will issue 156 million shares to acquire all the outstanding 89.1 million shares of U.S. Robotics, plus over time it will issue another 32 million shares to acquire U.S. Robotics options (corrects number of shares from 132 million).</p>
<p>The executives said that the ratio of the deal, whereby each share in U.S. Robotics will be exchanged for 1.75 shares of 3Com's stock, is a &quot;fixed exchange ratio&quot; that will not be affected by any fluctuations in either company's stock price.  </p>
<p>While the two networking companies did not give many immediate details about where the cost savings will come from, they said that U.S. Robotics will clearly take the lead in the area of remote access technology, through its leading position in high speed modems.</p>
<p>&quot;(Our) investments in remote access technology can be clearly consolidated into U.S. Robotics' investments,&quot; said 3Com Chairman and CEO Eric Benhamou, adding that U.S. Robotics' investments in cell switching and frame switching technology can be consolidated into 3Com's ongoing investments in switching technology.  </p>
<p>&quot;At a time when the market is consolidating around a few core leaders, the strength of 3Com and U.S. Robotics is unequalled,&quot; Benhamou said during the conference call. The remaining company will retain the 3Com name, with more than 12,000 employees and more than $5 billion in revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;Together, from the user perspective, 3Com and U.S. Robotics are delivering rich end-to-end connectivity solutions across LANS (local area networks) and WANS (wide area networks),&quot; Benhamou said, referring to a departmental or single location corporate network (LAN) and a network that includes multiple or even international network locations.  </p>
<p>While many Wall Street analysts asked if the merger was another &quot;Cisco-killer,&quot; referring to networking giant Cisco Systems Inc, the executives said the deal was not just to target Cisco, which dominates core routing technology.</p>
<p>&quot;Cisco is not our only target... We are creating a much more different and balanced company,&quot; Benhamou said.</p>
<p>3Com, whose co-founder Robert Metcalfe invented Ethernet networking technolgy, develops hubs (devices that control networks), routers (devices that link several networks) and network adapter cards that enable PCs to be linked to a network.</p>
