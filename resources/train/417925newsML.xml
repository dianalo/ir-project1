<headline>NYMEX natgas ends up, shorts cover on firmer cash.</headline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended higher across the board Tuesday in a moderate session, lifted by a steady stream of short covering amid unexpected strength in the cash, industry sources said.</p>
<p>April rallied 14 cents to close at $1.943 per million British thermal units. May settled 11.6 cents higher at $1.979. Other deferreds ended up by 4.2 to 9.4 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a constructive settlement. We couldn't get below $1.80 (in April) with any conviction, then we broke a steep downtrend. Everyone was betting on the short side and got caught,&quot; said one Midwest trader, adding April could break $2.  </p>
<p>Traders said reports of firmer physical prices from injection buying in the producing region spilled into the paper market, stampeding the shorts.</p>
<p>But while some felt the seasonal bottom was in place, most still expected the upside to be limited by forecasts for milder weather later in the week.</p>
<p>Technical traders said April's close above resistance at $1.93 should lead to a test of the $2.04 area. Support was still seen at $1.78-80, with further buying likely in the mid-$1.70s and then at the contract low of $1.701.</p>
<p>In the physical market, Gulf Coast prices gained almost 10 cents Tuesday to the mid-$1.80s. Midcon pipes were more than five cents higher in the low-$1.70s. New York city gate swing gas eased several cents to about $2.10.</p>
<p>The 12-month strip jumped 7.2 cents to $2.088.</p>
<p>NYMEX Permian and Alberta natgas did not trade Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, April finished 13 cents higher at $1.71, while deferreds ended up by six to 12 cents. The East/West spread widened by one cent to 23.3 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 412 lots changed hands, up from Monday's total of 187.</p>
