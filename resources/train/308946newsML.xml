<p>CBOT soybean futures closed higher with January posting double-digit gains as concerns grew that hot, dry weather in key South American soybean regions would damage crops, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders noted USDA's ending stocks projections indicated limited soybean supplies, leaving little margin for losses out of Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>&quot;The bean carry is going to be very tight,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter. &quot;The market has been pretty tenacious since Friday when USDA put their (production and ending stocks) numbers out.&quot;</p>
<p>The March contract has gained about 45 cents per bushel since closing Thursday at $6.99-1/2. That contract closed at $7.45-1/2 on Wednesday, the highest since October 10.</p>
<p>Forecasts called for high temperatures in Rio Grande Do Sul, Brazil, to be five to 10 degrees above normal, according to Weather Services Corp.</p>
<p>But meteorologists disagreed on whether rain would fall in parched regions of Brazil. Some meteorologists said showers would be scattered and miss key growing areas.</p>
<p>Soybeans closed 1-3/4 to 10-3/4 cents per bushel higher with March up 8-1/2 at $7.45-1/2.</p>
<p>Commercials continued to buy the nearbys, due in part to falling crush margins, traders said. January crush margins were down 4.15 cents per bushel to 54.21 and March margins were down 1.02 cents at 43.53, CBOT said.</p>
<p>ADM, Cargill Inc, Central Soya and Continental Grain were among the buyers, traders said. Central Soya reportedly bull-spread 3.5 million bushels March/May and two million bushels March/July.</p>
<p>May crush margins were up 6.05 cents and July margins were up 4.73 cents.  </p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 56,000 contracts, compared with Tuesday's actual volume of 54,367 contracts.</p>
