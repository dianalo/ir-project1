<p>A natural gas pipeline linking Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana by the year 2000 will be run commercially by a company owned by private investors from all four countries, according to a senior Ghanaian official.</p>
<p>The off-shore pipeline could be extended later to Ivory Coast and landlocked states in the region which had expressed interest, Joe Klemsu, Director Petroleum of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, told Reuters in an interview.  </p>
<p>&quot;All producers in the region, no matter how small, should be able to feed into the pipeline. It has to be a two-way thing,&quot; he said on Friday (eds correct).</p>
<p>Nigeria is to supply the bulk of the gas but Ghana has natural gas in the Tano Basin bordering Ivory Coast. Nigeria's proven natural gas reserves are 100 trillion cubic feet. The Ghana National Petroleum Company estimates Ghana's potential daily production at 22 million cubic feet.</p>
<p>Chevron Corp is known to be bidding to build the pipeline. It would carry gas from Chevron's Escravos field in Nigeria, gas which is currently being flared.  </p>
<p>&quot;The company for the development of the pipeline is going to be operating on commercial lines and is going to be owned by private investors in all four countries involved,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The first step is to get an independent consultant to determine the commercial viability of the pipeline. Next is to appoint a private developer to go ahead with the project.&quot;</p>
<p>Klemsu also said that all four countries should be able to both tap gas from or feed gas into the pipeline, which will cost a projected $270 million and take 24-months to build.  </p>
<p>Petroleum and energy ministers from Nigeria, Togo, Benin and Ghana agreed on Tuesday to establish a limited liability company to speed up development of the project.</p>
<p>&quot;On November 14, when the ministers meet again, in Abuja, a clear set of objectives as well as the board of directors of that company will be decided on,&quot; Klemsu said. &quot;The company that will see the light next month in Abuja is only a promotor for the construction and exploitation company that is to come.&quot;</p>
<p>The launch of the pipeline promotion company will be funded by the participating countries.  </p>
<p>&quot;The ministers decided to set up a company to confirm the viability of an open-access pipeline and then solicit and secure private sector paticipation of the development of the scheme through the issue of a propectus,&quot; Klemsu said.</p>
<p>He said the role of government would be minimal. &quot;We privatise everything here and the main sellers of the gas -- Chevron, Shell Nigeria -- are private. The main buyers will be private too.&quot;</p>
<p>Klemsu said demand in Ghana, Togo and Benin was between 50 and 100 million cubic feet per day, mostly for power generation and industry. Ghana accounted for 80 percent of this.  </p>
<p>The West Africa Gas Pipeline Project Steering Committee met for the first time in Benin on August 27. An Economic Community of West Africa States team attended Tuesday's meeting in Accra.</p>
<p>Nigerian Oil Minister Dan Etete, chairman of the steering committee, said last week that oil companies and individuals would be allowed to participate in the project.</p>
<p>He said the project company would take off within the next four weeks, adding that the four nations were determined that the execution of the project should begin by January next year.</p>
