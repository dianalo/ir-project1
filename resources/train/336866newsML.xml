<headline>Shell, Texaco near letter of intent on US venture.</headline>

<p>Shell Oil Co, Houston-based unit of Royal Dutch/Shell group, and Star Enterprises, a joint venture between Texaco Inc and state-owned Saudi Aramco, are near agreement on a letter of intent to combine their U.S. downstream operations, Shell President Philip Carroll said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm optimistic that in the not-too-distant future we'll be able to announce the signing of the letter of intent to proceed,&quot; Carroll said of the companies' plans to merge their U.S. refining and retail operations.</p>
<p>The companies in October announced plans to combine their respective U.S. downstream operations in a venture that analysts said would have a refining capacity of 1.8 million barrels a day and control about 11 percent to 15 percent of the U.S. petroleum market.</p>
<p>The venture is expected to cut refining, marketing and transportation costs of the partners by an estimated $1 billion a year and could spark a wave of similar ventures among major oil companies in the domestic market, analysts said.</p>
<p>The companies had signalled plans to sign a letter of intent by the end of 1996, but Carroll said they are still hashing out details on the structure of the venture and each partner's ownership stake in it.</p>
<p>&quot;Talks are going well, but these are of necessity, complicated and sometimes difficult negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The companies expect the venture to pass muster with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, but Carroll said the partners may have to sell off some smaller properties to obtain antitrust clearance.</p>
<p>&quot;The letter of intent is only stage one, but I am optimistic. I think we are making good progress,&quot; he said.</p>
