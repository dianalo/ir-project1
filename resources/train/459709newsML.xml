<headline>Kohl popularity slumps amid economic gloom - poll.</headline>
<dateline>BONN 1997-03-21</dateline>

<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's popularity rating fell to its lowest for more than two years in a monthly poll published on Friday, which said Germans were gloomier about their economy than at any time in two decades.</p>
<p>The Politbarometer poll by the Electoral Research Group for ZDF television also said two-thirds of Germans opposed the idea of a single European Union currency but most believed it would be introduced, albeit with a delay.</p>
<p>Since the start of the year, the popularity of Kohl and his government has been hit by soaring unemployment, controversial plans to reform the tax and pensions systems, and the fear that Germany's generous welfare system is being radically pruned.</p>
<p>Kohl slipped to ninth in the list of most popular politicians for the first time in this parliament, with a rating of -0.1 on a scale of -5 to +5.</p>
<p>The man seen as having the best chance of toppling Kohl in the election in late 1998, Lower Saxony premier Gerhard Schroeder of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), jumped to the top of the popularity ratings with +1.0.</p>
<p>The SPD has yet to decide whether party chairman Oskar Lafontaine or another leader, perhaps Schroeder, will be its leading candidate in 1998.</p>
<p>When asked to choose between Schroeder and Kohl, 48 percent of the 1,239 respondents said they wanted Schroeder as chancellor, while 38 percent preferred Kohl. But when compared with Lafontaine, Kohl led by 43 percent to 38.</p>
<p>Schroeder is among the very few German government or opposition politicians to tap widespread scepticism about European monetary union and say openly that the single currency should be delayed if its stability cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>The poll indicated 65 percent of Germans rejected the euro currency, a level which has remained steady for five years.</p>
<p>Some 52 percent of respondents said the euro would bring mostly disadvantages, 32 percent said it would be neutral for Germany, and just 10 percent saw it as positive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, 74 percent of Germans believed the euro would come, although 81 percent of these did not expect to see it introduced on time on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>Despite these worries, and the fact that the euro is closely associated with Kohl, the swing towards the opposition parties in opinion polls has not been conclusive.</p>
<p>The ZDF survey said that if an election were held this week, Kohl's Christian Democrats would score 39 percent, down a point from last month, and their liberal Free Democrat coalition partners would poll five percent.</p>
<p>The Social Democrats would score an unchanged 35 percent and their presumed coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens, would receive 12 percent, up one point.</p>
<p>But their combined total would not give them an absolute majority, with the balance of power most likely held by the reform communist Party of Democratic Socialism, on four percent.</p>
