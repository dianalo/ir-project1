<p>Hungary's privatisation programme will suffer only minor delays as a result of the scandal which led to the dismissal of the whole board of the state privatisation agency APV, the agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Privatisation cannot stop and the country has every chance to complete it as a success story despite the difficulties we have had,&quot; chairman of the newly appointed board of directors Arpad Kovacs told reporters after its first meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The new board, named by the government last week, plans to discuss a report on bids received for Magyar Hitel Bank Rt (MHB), Hungary's fifth largest bank, on November 7, Kovacs said, adding that he did not know if the board would then be in a position to choose the winner of the tender.</p>
<p>Kovacs, former director of the State Audit Office, said the board plans to work out the new procedural rules for decision-making by the end of November and is reviewing APV's previous practices but in the meantime will also discuss new privatisation issues.</p>
<p>Member of the board Pal Szabo made it clear that APV had completed preparations for the final decision on MHB.</p>
<p>According to earlier press reports, Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein and the Dutch ABN Amro Bank NV submitted bids in the one-round tender for the sale of an 89.23 percent stake in MHB.</p>
<p>The government sacked the minister of industry and trade Tamas Suchman and APV's whole board of directors earlier this month following revelations of irregular payments amounting to millions of dollars to an adviser to APV.</p>
