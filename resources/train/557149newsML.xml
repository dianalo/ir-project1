<p>Dutch analysts welcomed the small first quarter profit rise that paper maker and office equipment group NV Koninklijke KNP BT reported on Friday but said the outlook for the rest of the year remained uncertain.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at those prospects, I think there is a fairly large uncertainty,&quot; Bank Bangert Pontier's Henk Brouwer said.</p>
<p>KNP BT said it expected the full-year net profit to be substantially better than the 231 million guilders posted in 1996. But Brouwer said such a prediction could imply an improvement by anything in a range between 10 and 40 percent.</p>
<p>Analyst Jan Wirken of IRIS Research said that KNP BT's higher first quarter net, barely one month after its warning that first quarter profits would fall, had proved once again that the company had difficulties in predicting its own results.</p>
<p>Last year KNP BT surprised the market by announcing an unexpectedly high first quarter profit fall.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently the company still is not able to give a reliable forecast,&quot; Wirken said.</p>
<p>Bangert Pontier's Brouwer said KNP BT's sales volumes were not bad given the difficult market situation but margins were under pressure in virtually all its sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not expect that profitability will really improve much in the rest of the year, although the paper division's second and third quarter of 1996 were extremely bad,&quot; Brouwer said.</p>
<p>If KNP BT's paper division could realise a small positive result this year and its distibution and packaging sectors remained more or less steady, that alone would bring in a reasonable overall profit improvement, he added.</p>
<p>Wirken said he expected the company's distribution division to post higher profits for the full-year 1997 because of takeovers in previous years and improving margins.</p>
<p>Margins in KNP BT's packaging division were also seen picking up but Wirken did not expect a higher 1997 profit for this sector because of the recent sale of its flexible and protective packaging activities to Tenneco of the U.S.</p>
<p>KNP BT said the profit on the deal would be partly offset by restructuring charges and would be included in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Wirken estimated the overall one-off net positive effect of the sale in the second quarter at 0.88 guilders per share, more than double the 0.42 guilders net per share that KNP BT posted in its first quarter.</p>
<p>Wirken said he expected KNP BT's paper division to post higher full-year earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;But not so much because business is doing well but more because it went so bad last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that the paper division's results would not only be influenced by market trends, which were still unpromising, but also by the costs of closing and restarting production units.</p>
<p>Wirken said he might cut his recommendation on the KNP BT shares to a Hold from a previous Buy but added that he had not worked out his full-year profit estimates.</p>
<p>Brouwer said he tended to give a sell recommendation on the stock, despite the fact that first quarter results were better than expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the uncertainty for the rest of the year, I think that a higher share price today would be a good opportunity to say goodbye to the stock,&quot; Brouwer said.</p>
<p>On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, KNP BT's shares were up 1.10 guilders at 39.50 guilders at midday trading.</p>
