<p>U.S. ambassador Gabriel Guerra- Mondragon denied Friday protectionism by the U.S. government in a dispute over Chilean salmon imports, saying the claims of dumping were made by private American salmon producers.</p>
<p>&quot;The North American government has absolutely no protectionist stance,&quot; Guerra-Mondragon told reporters at the U.S. embassy during Fourth of July celebrations.</p>
<p>&quot;This was an action by private North American salmon producers who presented a complaint to the North American Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission.&quot;  </p>
<p>U.S. salmon producers have accused their Chilean counterparts of dumping fresh Atlantic salmon in the American market and of receiving illegal state subsidies.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department began investigations into the claims Wednesday following a formal complaint in June from the American companies.</p>
<p>To prove dumping charges, the accuser must generally show the producer is selling below cost, or below the cost at which it sells its product in its home market.  </p>
<p>Chile has said it will defend the salmon producers against the subsidy allegations, while the companies themselves are planning to spend millions of dollars on their legal defence.</p>
<p>Guerra-Mondragon dismissed comments from Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza Thursday that U.S. anti-dumping laws could breach World Trade Organization rules.</p>
<p>&quot;Our laws fall completely within the regulations agreed by the World Trade Organization,&quot; said Guerra-Mondragon.</p>
<p>U.S. supermarkets and restaurants account for 30 percent of Chile's total salmon exports, with shipments to the American market worth around $180 million.  </p>
<p>In a separate trade dispute, Guerra-Mondragon said the U.S. government is studying an appeal against a San Francisco federal court ruling barring the agriculture department from issuing new import permits for logs and wood chips from several countries including Chile.</p>
<p>&quot;The agriculture department is analyzing the decision of the judge and we are studying whether or not we appeal against the judge's decision,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chilean officials have said the ban on new permits could hit forestry exports worth around $100 million a year.</p>
