<title>NEW ZEALAND: CARLTON TO RELAUNCH MAJOR BRANDS IN NEW ZEALAND.</title>
<headline>CARLTON TO RELAUNCH MAJOR BRANDS IN NEW ZEALAND.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1997-08-08</dateline>

<p>Australia's Carlton and United Breweries (CUB) said on Friday it would relaunch two of its major brands onto the New Zealand market.</p>
<p>Owned by Australian brewing giant Fosters Brewing Group Ltd, CUB is relaunching Carlton Gold and Crown Lager with Auckland's Bates Group appointed to run the campaign.</p>
<p>The September launch would represent a major committment in advertising and sales promotion in a market experiencing dropping sales.  </p>
<p>Carlton vice president of national marketing Paul Kennedy said they had conducted extensive market research and had come to the conclusion that there was plenty of room for the brands in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Carlton Cold is a refreshing, easier style of drinking and that's the way the market's heading so we have decided to relaunch the brand very strongly here in New Zealand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The premium market in New Zealand is also a growing segment and Kennedy said that this meant their were opportunities for Carlton.  </p>
<p>&quot;Crown has grown 40 per cent in New Zealand in two years too without very much support at all so we believe the timing is right to lend some heavy-weight electronic promotion to the brand,&quot;</p>
<p>A television campaign had been put together which Kennedy said was a &quot;very significant spend&quot; and the buy &quot;eclipses the $250,000 we spent last year here.&quot;</p>
<p>The core of the television campaign would be Australian advertisements that have been slightly changed for the New Zealand market.</p>
