<p>Four people, including three policemen, died in a suicide bomb attack by a woman assailant on a riot police headquarters in the southern Turkish town of Adana on Friday, the state-run Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>The attacker was blown to pieces in the explosion, Anatolian said. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>In July, a young woman from the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) killed nine Turkish soldiers when she rushed into a military parade in the eastern town of Tunceli and let off a bomb hidden under her clothes.</p>
<p>It was the first suicide attack of the PKK's 12-year fight for independence or autonomy in the mainly Kurdish southeast but a few months before PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan had threatened a wave of such bombings.</p>
<p>Although Adana is not in the area where the PKK is fighting, it is crowded with Kurds who have fled the southeast.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed in fighting between Turkish troops and the PKK.</p>
