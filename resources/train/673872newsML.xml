<p>Don't have that pre-dinner drink if you want to lose weight, Dutch researchers advised on Thursday -- an aperitif does stimulate the appetite.</p>
<p>People who have an alcoholic drink before sitting down to lunch or dinner eat more than those who have fruit juice or water, Dr Margriet Westerterp and colleagues at Maastricht University found.</p>
<p>They told the Eighth European Congress on Obesity, being held in Dublin, that people who had a drink ate more quickly and consumed &quot;significantly' more calories than those who did not. It did not matter whether they were overweight.</p>
<p>&quot;From this study we conclude that alcohol consumption from wine or beer had a stimulating effect on eating rate and on short-term energy intake,&quot; they said in a statement released in London ahead of the congress.</p>
<p>&quot;To obese people this observation suggests that they might be advised to avoid wine or beer as an aperitif, since these drinks were shown to stimulate food intake.&quot;</p>
