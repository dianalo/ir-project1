<p>The dollar ended higher in U.S. trading, continuing an overnight rally on weak Japanese economic data and fresh signs that some European countries might fail to meet economic targets for monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the news was overnight, we just followed through in New York,&quot; said Tom Arnold, chief dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.</p>
<p>The dollar hit a 10-day high against the German mark and approached its 1997 high of 1.7423. It settled at 1.7390/00 marks, up from 1.7315/25 at the open and 1.7250/60 at Thursday's close.  </p>
<p>Dollar/yen rose to 114.58/68 from 114.37/47 at the open and 113.10/20 at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Japan reported its industrial output rose 3.8 percent in May, but projected a decline in June and also reported its highest unemployment rate in 44 years.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita defended Japan's current low interest rates, saying they could not rise until the economy strengthened.</p>
<p>&quot;The negative economic news means Japan may not be raising interest rates as soon as people thought and that caused the dollar to climb,&quot; Arnold said.  </p>
<p>That contrasted with strong U.S. economic data, including a record high of 104.5 in the University of Michigan's June consumer sentiment index and the final report on first-quarter gross domestic product, which rose 5.9 percent.</p>
<p>European officials continued to signal key nations would fail to cut their budget deficits to three percent of GDP, the benchmark for joining an the proposed euro.</p>
<p>A French government source was quoted as saying France would only get down to 3.5 percent in 1997 and Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen noted that Germany seemed unable and France unwilling to meet the requirements.  </p>
<p>&quot;Most people still believe monetary union will take place, but the uncertainties surrounding it gave the dollar a boost,&quot; said Marc Chandler, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Many experts now see a less stringent application of the euro criteria, which could lead to a wider group of participants, including traditionally weaker and debt-ridden currencies like the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta.</p>
<p>That would tend to weaken the mark and strengthen the dollar, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of pressure on the mark across the board. That's also propelling the dollar,&quot; said Ben Strauss, assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer.</p>
<p>The mark also fell against the British pound, which is not slated to join the euro group, and the lira, despite an Italian interest rate cut late in the session.</p>
<p>Sterling/mark peaked at 2.8925, a 59-month high.</p>
<p>The mark has been under pressure against the lira, but may have gotten a minor boost when the Bank of Italy cut its discount and lombard rates by 50 basis points during the U.S. afternoon.  </p>
<p>Mark/lira slowly crawled above 977 after the news.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar rose to 1.4520/30 Swiss francs from 1.4420/30 at the open and 1.4355/65 at Thursday's close. Sterling dipped to $1.6627/37 from $1.6662/72. The dollar fell to Canadian $1.3805/10 from C$1.3818/23. The Australian dollar fell to $0.7453/58 from $0.7480/85.</p>
