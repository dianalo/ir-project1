<headline>Brazil stirs debt market with Brady swap/buyback.</headline>

<p>Brazil stunned the emerging debt market on Wednesday by offering to either swap Brady bonds for 30-year global bonds or repurchase the Bradies outright via Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>New York dealers pegged initial price talk for the global bonds at around 400 basis points over U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like it will be well received, and the U.S. Treasury market will be friendly for this type of offering,&quot; said Thomas Trebat, managing director at Citicorp Securities.  </p>
<p>The offer, which had been discussed as an option since Mexico conducted a similar exchange last May, led to a dramatic price rise for the affected instruments.</p>
<p>Brazil said it would either pay investors cash for their Par bonds, and Discount Z-L bonds or it would swap Pars, Discounts, or &quot;C&quot; bonds Bradies for a $1.0 billion issue of 30-year uncollaterized, SEC-registered global bonds.</p>
<p>After the news, the liquid &quot;C&quot; bond rose above a 79 bid, and settled 1-3/8 higher at 78-5/8 by late morning, while Discounts stood 1-3/4 higher at 82-7/8, and Pars were up 1-1/8 to 66.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was very frantic but right now it's very calm,&quot; said Marcelo Fleury, vice president at Garban Corp. &quot;It's not an innovation, but for Brazil it's very good news.&quot;</p>
<p>Brady bond dealers said that, while prices might slip from their highs, the market had plenty of reason to speculate on the upside.</p>
<p>The offer will expire at 1500 EDT/1900 GMT on June 3, unless extended or ended earlier by Brazil.  </p>
<p>The Pars would be valued at 250 basis points over the November 2026 T-bond, and the &quot;C&quot; bond would be set at 460 basis points over May 2007 T-bond. Discounts will be fixed at $818.75 per $1,000.</p>
<p>The global bond will be priced through a modified Dutch auction. Brazil will select a single clearing spread, which, along with the yield of the November 2026 T-bond, will determine the yield and price of the global bonds.</p>
<p>Investors may also purchase the global bond for cash, as long as the cash sale does not exceed 25 percent of the total issue.</p>
<p>Analysts applauded the offer, explaining the new global bond would dramatically extend the country's yield curve.</p>
<p>&quot;This is definately a step in the right direction,&quot; said Raul Elizalde, head of quantitative analysis at ING Barings. &quot;What this allows is a better yield curve for Brazil.&quot;</p>
