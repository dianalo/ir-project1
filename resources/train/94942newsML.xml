<p>Norwegian food-based conglomerate Orkla ASA on Thursday reported strong eight-month profits thanks to positive results in the branded consumer goods area as well as a rise in portfolio gains.</p>
<p>Group profits before tax were 1.75 billion crowns ($268.6 million), up 26 percent from the same period last year. Earnings per share rose 20 percent to 25.7 crowns.</p>
<p>Operating profits, adjusted for other revenues and costs, increased 27 percent to 1.28 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Operating revenues increased to 16.74 billion crowns from 13.13 billion. This growth was primarily due to acquisitions of new companies. Profit from associated companies rose to 140 million crowns from 115 million crowns.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profits beat market expectations and Orkla A shares were traded 1.10 percent higher at 369 crowns by mid-afternoon on the Oslo stock exchange.</p>
<p>The company said trends were particularly satisfactory for both foods and beverages in the branded consumer goods area. Branded consumer goods operating profits increased to 942 million crowns from 647 million.</p>
<p>Chemicals fell slightly to 326 million crowns from 333 million with falling pulp prices largely offset by profit growth for Fine Chemicals. ($ = 6.514 Norwegian Crowns)</p>
