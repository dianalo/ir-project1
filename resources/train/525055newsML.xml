<p>IPL Energy Inc restarted the last of its downed crude pipelines Friday evening after repairing a small leak on the line in a Canadian region southwest of Winnipeg, Manitoba, an IPL spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically at the end of the day what resulted is that 583,700 barrels did not move due to the shutdown,&quot; said IPL's Jeff Mann, noting just five to 10 barrels of heavy crude leaked from the line.</p>
<p>The other three lines, two carrying crude and one carrying refined products, were not leaking and were quickly restored, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'weeper' was on line three, which is our (heavy crude) line,&quot; Mann said, using an industry term used to describe small leaks.</p>
<p>He said the cause of the leak was not yet known and that the company was continuing to work with Canada's Transportation Safety Board to identify the cause.</p>
<p>Mann noted the regulating body could prescribe additional measures besides the repairs IPL performed Friday to prevent any leakage from reoccurring on the line.</p>
<p>The other lines IPL pulled out of service following a report from a nearby resident of an oil smell were: line one, a refined products line, and lines 2b and 13, both crude oil lines, Mann said.</p>
<p>IPL restarted the repaired line three late Friday at 1820 MST/0020 GMT, after shutting all four lines lines Friday morning at 0529 MST/1129 GMT.</p>
<p>It had restarted lines one, 2b and 13 by noon MST/1800 GMT, Mann said.</p>
<p>IPL's Interprovincial pipeline system, which can move up to 1.8 million barrels per day of liquids, combines with the Lakeside system on the U.S. side of the border.</p>
<p>The system, running from Edmonton, Alberta through Superior, Wisconsin and Chicago to various points in southern Ontario, is the world's longest crude oil and liquids pipeline complex.</p>
