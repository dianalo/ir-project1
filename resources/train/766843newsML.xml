<title>BELGIUM: European banks say on track to launch Euribor.</title>
<headline>European banks say on track to launch Euribor.</headline>

<p>Europe's banks said on Wednesday they were close to finalising the technical details of a plan to launch a Euribor benchmark interest rate once Europe's single currencys starts.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be a matter of weeks,&quot; one banking source told Reuters.</p>
<p>Euribor is designed to replace national interbank interest rates, such as the London interbank offered rate (Libor) or Paris Interbank offered rate (Pibor), which serve as benchmark rates for eurobonds, swaps, futures and other derivatives.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Banking Federation of the European Union and the International Foreign Exchange Dealers Association (ACI) said the Euribor rate would be based on rates quoted by leading banks operating with the EMU zone.</p>
<p>About 58 EU banks and six non-EMU banks would be asked to contribute rates. Banks would be selected by national banking associations, an official said.</p>
<p>The Federation noted the number of European banks participating at the outset was likely to be less than 58 because not all EU states would take part in EMU from its planned 1999 start.</p>
<p>One banking source said it appeared the European Monetary Institute, the Frankfurt-based precursor to Europe's planned central bank, was now prepared to back the project after initially rejecting it.</p>
<p>&quot;They are reviewing their decision (to refuse),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The banks believed the ECB should sponsor an overnight Euribor fixing to be used as the basis for derivative contracts and eurobond issues traded or being issued outside the EMU time zone, he said.</p>
