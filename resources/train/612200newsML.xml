<p>Juergen Klinsmann fulfilled a childhood dream by winning his first German league title with Bayern Munich on Saturday.</p>
<p>But even so, he said, he did not regret leaving the club which has been nicknamed &quot;Hollywood City&quot; because of its constant drama.</p>
<p>Germany's captain, who is giving up a lucrative contract to join Italy's Sampdoria because he is unhappy with the way he has been treated, played an important role in Bayern's championship-winning 4-2 victory over VfB Stuttgart.</p>
<p>Afterwards Klinsmann said: &quot;This is the thing you dream about doing as a small boy. I'm going to enjoy it for a few days. It is a bit of a happy end.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't regret leaving. So many things have happened. There are so many different philosophies in football. And mine did not fit in here.&quot;</p>
<p>Klinsmann was often at the centre of criticism during the season. He hated the bickering and back-stabbing which was part of everyday life at a club which has earned the &quot;Hollywood&quot; tag this season because its arguments were always in the news.</p>
<p>The forward was embroiled in a public row with club captain and former World Cup hero Lothar Matthaeus. The defensive tactics of Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni often frustrated the player intensely.</p>
<p>Klinsmann's feelings boiled over in the tense final run-in when he kicked in an advertising sign after being substituted during one match, leaving the field shouting and cursing. Soon afterwards it was announced that he was joining Sampdoria.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a mad season,&quot; Matthaeus admitted. &quot;But drama always seems to be part of this club. But we are all absolutely delighted about this title.&quot;</p>
<p>Chairman Franz Beckenbauer, who has often criticised the team in public, said he hoped there would be fewer battles next season.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end they were one unit,&quot; the former Bayern player and World Cup-winning captain and coach said. &quot;We have these situations and sometimes they are taken a bit too seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;Bayern is a bit of kitchen of gossip but it has been like that in the past...(But) I knew we were top-class in terms of quality. We deserved to win the title.&quot;</p>
