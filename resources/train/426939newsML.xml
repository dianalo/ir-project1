<p>TOP STORIES</p>
<p>- The government has moved to dampen speculation of top-level changes at the Finance Ministry and Bank of Thailand following the suspension of three senior central bankers and two police investigators in the Bangkok Bank of Commerce case. The prime minister has dismissed reports that Amnuay Viravan, the finance minister, would be sacked and Rerngchai Marakanond, the central bank governor, was poised to quit.

<p>- A senior national security official has called on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to persuade Burma to seek a ceasefire with ethnic rebels. The official says that to tackle the problem at its roots the UNHCR should hold urgent talks with the Burmese government to urge it to seek ceasefire agreements with rebel groups fighting for greater autonomy for decades.

<p>- Thailand will seek the cooperation of China in discouraging the farming of a plant which produces an alkaloid found in amphetamines, says Prime Minister's Office Minister Veerakorn Kamprakob. He says he plans to visit China to discuss the issue before meeting the United Nations in July. He says such cooperation is a vital step towards stopping the spread of amphetamines among Thai youth and that most products are smuggled from Laos and Burma through northern border provinces.

<p>- Foreign power companies will sweep most of the independent power producer contracts in the next round of IPP bidding unless the government finds a way to help Thai firms raise funds.

<p>- The Industry Ministry wants to encourage supermarket chains in Japan, the U.S. and the European Union to buy processed food products from Thailand. The move is part of Minister Korn Dabbaransi's pledge to help, which was made on coming to office. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
