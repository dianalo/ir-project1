<p>The jurors in the Oklahoma City bombing trial said on Saturday they were so convinced of Timothy McVeigh's guilt they only voted once and then wept for 90 minutes before walking into the courtroom to relay the verdict.</p>
<p>&quot;Twelve people cried when we pronounced him guilty. It took us a good hour, hour and a half to calm ourselves down so we could go into the courtroom again,&quot; juror Ruth Meier told reporters.</p>
<p>Looking refreshed and relaxed, the 12 jurors appeared at a downtown Denver hotel one day after sentencing McVeigh to die for the April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>The jurors said the sheer volume of the prosecution's evidence was what convinced them of McVeigh's guilt.</p>
<p>When asked what question they would most like to ask McVeigh about the bombing, they all answered &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>Toward the end of the news conference, which lasted about 20 minutes, they all said &quot;no&quot; when asked if they wanted to serve on a jury again.</p>
<p>The jury of five women and seven men also gave high marks to federal Judge Richard Matsch who kept order in the courtroom and the pace of the trial moving. &quot;Matsch for president,&quot; jury foreman James Osgood said.</p>
