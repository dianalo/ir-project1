<p>The U.S. economy grew at the fastest clip in more than nine years during the first quarter, the government said Wednesday, as the nation's six-year-old expansion showed few signs of fading.</p>
<p>But the data showed that price increases have picked up, which could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again next month, though financial markets shrugged off the inflation figures and rallied for the third straight session.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the U.S. economy, grew at a rapid 5.6 percent annual rate in the quarter, well ahead of the fourth quarter's pace of 3.8 percent, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>The growth -- the strongest since 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 1987 -- along with a pickup in two key measures of inflation could prompt Fed policy-makers to raise rates again in a bid to ward off inflation, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;This was an explosive first quarter for economic activity, accompanied by a worrisome increase in price inflation,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Primark Decision Economics Inc. in Boston.</p>
<p>&quot;There is good news in this report in the sense that we produced many thousands of jobs in the first quarter, but bad news in that it cannot possibly be sustained,&quot; said economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Sohn and others predicted the pace of growth will slow later in the year, as businesses scale back production after a huge first-quarter inventory buildup. The inventory buildup came largely in response to strong consumer spending -- which drives two-thirds of the economy and rose at a 6.4 percent rate in the quarter, the fastest in nine years.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said growth would have been even stronger in the quarter except that imports surged and exports slowed, hurting sales of American goods in foreign markets.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration, while hailing the strong growth, was at pains to play down inflation worries.</p>
<p>At the White House, President Clinton said the first quarter showed &quot;more strong growth with moderate inflation&quot; that has boosted both workers' incomes and corporate profits.</p>
<p>Analysts said the rise in prices measured by the report was troubling and could force Fed policy-makers to keep raising rates until demand slowed. The central bank raised short-term rates a quarter point on March 25, citing the need to keep the six-year-old expansion on track.</p>
<p>Higher rates tend to slow economic growth and corporate profits, but investors did not appear too concerned about another Fed rate rise. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 46.96 points to close at 7,008.99, a day after soaring 179 points -- its second biggest point gain ever -- on reports that eased fears inflationary pressures were building.</p>
<p>Bond prices also rose again, with the 30-year Treasury up about a third of a point, lowering its yield to 6.96 percent from 6.98 percent on Tuesday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Fed policy-makers are to meet again on May 20 to weigh another rise in rates, which would be a gamble since there have been some signs the economy is already slowing from its blistering first-quarter pace.</p>
<p>Norwest's Sohn said he expected growth to slow to a 3.5 percent rate in the second quarter and to 2 percent in the second half of the year. That is near the Fed's preferred 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent growth rate that policy-makers feel can be maintained without forcing wages and prices up too quickly.</p>
<p>Sohn predicted the Fed will raise rates again at the next policy-makers' meeting, perhaps by as much as half a point instead of another quarter point move, to ensure a slowdown.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the strength of this report, I don't think (the Fed) can sit still,&quot; Sohn said.</p>
<p>Commerce Undersecretary Everett Ehrlich, interviewed on Reuters Financial Television, acknowledged that inflation was a greater risk so far into an expansion but insisted &quot;I don't think we see real evidence of an imminent danger.&quot;</p>
<p>Two inflation measures in the report pointed to faster price rises. The implicit price deflator rose at a 2.3 percent rate, up from a 1.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter and the sharpest rise since 2.4 percent in the second quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>The report's fixed-weight measure of price changes grew at a 2.7 percent rate, up from 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts said the large buildup in inventories in the first quarter was likely to contribute to a slowdown later this year as businesses throttle back on production.</p>
<p>Businesses added to their stocks of unsold goods at a $46.1 billion rate in the quarter, nearly triple the $17.1 billion rise recorded in the fourth quarter. Inventory production boosts GDP because it means factories were humming.</p>
<p>Personal spending grew 6.4 percent, a $73.5 billion-a-year clip in the quarter, nearly twice the 3.4 percent rise in the 1996 fourth quarter. It was the strongest rise since a 7.2 percent jump in the first quarter of 1988.</p>
