<p>Belgian shares rose on Friday, helped by gains in early Wall Street trade, but dealers said most people making investment decisions were still on holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;Many investors are on holiday today, the market is recovering mainly due to Wall Street,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Another trader said &quot;the real beginning of the year will be on Monday (January 6)&quot;.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Bel-20 index closed up 1.01 percent, or 18.84 points, to 1,889.89 but with only a modest 1.43 billion francs volume of shares traded.</p>
<p>Dealers said attention would focus on cyclical stocks in coming months as support from the bond market, which helped interest-rate sensitive equities in 1996, was not likely to be as strong this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Many investors are looking for industrial stocks because they're betting that the economy will improve this year,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Chemicals firm Tessenderlo rallied to close up 7.0 percent to 14,500 francs.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a big buyer on the market today, probably an institutional investor,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;It (Tessenderlo) is not a cheap stock now but the stories that have come out recently, like it will expand into France, have made investors want to buy the share,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>But trader Benoit Kint at brokerage Petercam said &quot;it's too high a price (at 14,500 francs) to pay at the moment, especially as nobody knows the PVC prices for 1997&quot;.</p>
<p>Elsewhere cement maker CBR climbed 4.2 percent to 2,960 francs with dealers putting it down to expectations that the European market will recovery in 1997.</p>
<p>Its recent increased stake in China Century Cement Ltd (CCC), to 30 percent from a previous five percent, has also encouraged investors to buy the stock.</p>
<p>Dollar-sensitive retailer Delhaize saw the biggest volume of shares traded on the Bel-20, closing up 2.2 percent to 1,890 francs.</p>
<p>&quot;Food Lion's fourth-quarter report just published showed turnover in line with market expectations, this puts Delhaize (Food Lion's parent company) in a good position for 1997,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Delhaize is due to release 1996 sales and provisional earnings figures next week. Brokerage G-Securities forecast sales up 12.5 percent to 415 billion Belgian francs and earnings per share up 19 percent to 87 francs.</p>
