<p>Interbank rates were steady to easier on Wednesday and governme t paper yields were mixed in very thin trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overnight cash eased to 4-1/2 3/8 percent from 4-3/4 5/8 at Tuesday midday and three-month money was virtually unchanged at 5-5/8 1/2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There is light demand on two-week and one-month money. Otherwise, trading was featureless,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The interbank market was unmoved by news that the United States decided to keep interest rates unchanged but brokers said upward pressure on rates should continue in early 1997.  </p>
<p>Government paper was mixed with short-term bill yields easing on the back of a liquid cash market but long-term note yields taking the lead of U.S. treasury yields, which edged up overnight, dealers said.</p>
<p>One-week bill yielded 4.18 percent, down from 4.21 and one-month yields eased three basis points to 4.32 percent.</p>
<p>Three-year note yields rose to 6.15 percent from 6.13, seven-year yields edged up to 7.15 from 7.11 percent and the longest 10-year note yielded 7.39 versus 7.35 percent.</p>
