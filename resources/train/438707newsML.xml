<p>Nantes take their 21-match unbeaten run to bottom club Nice this weekend hoping for a repeat of the 7-0 victory in September that kick-started their season.</p>
<p>Nantes had not managed a win in their opening 10 games before the floodgates opened againt Nice. They have not lost since, have climbed to sixth place and are challenging for a UEFA Cup place.</p>
<p>In spite of their form, Nantes were not underestimating the Cote d'Azur relegation candidates.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the squad have relaxed,&quot; said striker Jocelyn Gourvennec. &quot;Even if we have gone through a long series of matches without defeat, no-one's forgetting the nightmare at the start of the season. No-one wants to plunge back into that.</p>
<p>&quot;Our motivation is intact and away from home we are solid, especially at the back, so we're optimistic and we're going to look for a win. But it's not a question of taking victory in Nice for granted.&quot;</p>
<p>Nice assistant coach Gaby Desmenez said: &quot;We have to take revenge on Nantes for the humiliation of the 7-0 defeat. We have to erase this dishonour.&quot;</p>
<p>Nice have just 19 points and are six adrift of second from bottom Nancy.</p>
<p>Nantes' 3-0 win over third-placed Bastia last weekend was their first home victory since November. But they have won their last four away games.</p>
<p>Gourvennec (10) and Jpahet N'Doram (15) have contributed 25 of the 1995 French champions' 48 goals, a total onlyl matched in the first division by leaders Monaco.</p>
<p>It was a very different picture in September when in 10 games they had picked up only five points, all from draws and only one at home.</p>
<p>Then came the rout of Nice, with seven different scorers, and the unbeaten run which had begun with three successive draws -- their last defeat was at home to Metz in mid-September -- was well under way.</p>
<p>Talisman teenage goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, who has yet to taste defeat in 19 successive first division games, made his debut in the match prior to the Nice victory.</p>
<p>Coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau also warned against complacency when he said the calm that has set in since the win over Bastia &quot;does not mean that we underestimate our opponents. On the contrary, we would surely get punished if we did.&quot;</p>
<p>Argentine striker Javier Mazzoni dropped out of the Nantes squad with injury, but defender Eric Decroix returned.</p>
<p>Nice, who have had more than their share of injury problems this season, welcome back Serbian midfielder Zoran Milinkovic.</p>
<p>League leaders Monaco visit Rennes on Thursday to give them more recovery time before next week's UEFA Cup match with Newcastle.</p>
<p>Second-placed Paris St Germain, four points adrift, visit Le Havre while third-placed Bastia host Montpellier.</p>
