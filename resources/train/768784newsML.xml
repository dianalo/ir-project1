<p>Over 20,000 South Africans with serious previous criminal convictions had firearm licences, police minister Sydney Mufamadi said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The system of checking for previous convictions through the criminal record centre is inadequate and incapable of providing accurate information,&quot; Mufamadi said in a statement explaining why the licences had been issued.</p>
<p>&quot;Steps have already been taken to rectify this problem,&quot; he said, adding a task force was liaising with other offices to correct mistaken or duplicate identity numbers on the Population Register and facilitate consultation among state departments.</p>
<p>In an effort to control the proliferation of guns in the crime-afflicted country, Mufamadi last year appointed a four-person committee of inquiry to investigate administrative problems and irregularities at the Central Firearms Registry.</p>
<p>The committee identified management problems and labelled the system for controlling gun licensing as &quot;seriously flawed&quot;.</p>
<p>The committee also found that over 12,000 people had 10 or more licensed firearms, while 62 of those had between 50 and a whopping 648 firearms in their private collections, the minister said.</p>
<p>Last year 195,639 licences were approved in South Africa while nearly 14,000 applications were refused.</p>
