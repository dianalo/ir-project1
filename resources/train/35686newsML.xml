<p>Komag Inc said Thursday it expects earnings and sales for the third quarter to be below previous forecasts primarily due to lower than expected shipments of the company's latest product line.</p>
<p>Komag said it expects Q3 earnings per share to fall in the range of $0.30 and $0.50 a share on net sales of between $125 million and $140 million.</p>
<p>Komag had previously stated it expected Q3 earnings to at least match the $0.61 a share posted in the year-ago period.  </p>
<p>&quot;Third quarter financial results will fall short of our previous expectations due to various issues primarily associated with our transition to next-generation 2000 Oe disk products,&quot; said Stephen Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Komag.</p>
<p>Johnson said the company had reached internal large-scale production targets for the new product line but that shipment volume will fall below expected levels. Compounding the problems in the quarter was lower than expected demand for the company's older line of products, he added.</p>
<p>Unit sales are expected to fall below the 12.6 million units posted in Q2 which is expected to cut gross margins to 33-38 percent.</p>
<p>Johnson said he hopes gross margings will pick up in Q4 and said sales should beat the $152 million level reported in both Q1 and Q2 but that posting favorable year-over-year Q4 earnings now seems more challenging.</p>
<p>Komag is a maker of thin-film media used in computer disk drives. Its shares closed 1/2 lower at 20-1/4 on Nasdaq.</p>
