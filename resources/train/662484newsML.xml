<p>German police stormed a prison hospital in the eastern town of Naumburg on Sunday to free a prison worker who had been taken hostage on Saturday by an inmate, police said.</p>
<p>Authorities said neither the 43-year-old employee who had been taken hostage nor the inmate were injured in a raid launched by 30 police commandos.</p>
<p>The police blasted open a door with an explosive device and rushed into the hospital room. After a brief struggle they overwhelmed the hostage-taker, a 37-year-old man convicted in 1995 of attempted murder and not eligible for parole until 2002.</p>
<p>The hostage-taker had requested his case be reopened, police said. The prison worker was taken hostage on Saturday afternoon when the inmate pulled out a sharp object and forced the worker into the prison hospital with him.</p>
<p>Naumburg is about 160 km (100 miles) south of Berlin. The prison in Naumburg holds 300 prisoners and is the largest in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt.</p>
