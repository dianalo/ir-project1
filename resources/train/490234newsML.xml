<p>Veteran BBC war reporter Martin Bell launched on Monday what he hopes will be the shortest political career on record, nervously declaring that he would rather be on the front line in Bosnia than running for office.</p>
<p>Bell, one of Britain's most respected journalists, said he was prepared to stand as an anti-corruption candidate against a former Conservative minister accused of taking cash for asking questions in parliament on behalf of businessmen.</p>
<p>Wearing the trademark white suit in which he reported from the front lines of 11 wars including Bosnia, Bell told a packed news conference that he would fight the May 1 election unless Neil Hamilton withdrew or was rejected by his Conservative association at a meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;My belief is that I'm the shortest-lived political candidate with the shortest-lived political career that you will ever see and that by Wednesday morning it'll all be over,&quot; Bell, 58, said.</p>
<p>He said a political career had never occurred to him until last week when he was approached by the opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. They said they were willing to stand aside in Hamilton's constituency of Tatton, northwest England, if they could find a single candidate of high moral standing.</p>
<p>&quot;Up until two days ago I was cruising along towards the twilight of my career at the BBC, and I had no conception that anything like this was ever going to happen. Nor did I seek it.&quot;</p>
<p>Bell, who was wounded by shrapnel while reporting from Bosnia in August 1992, looked uneasy as he fielded sometimes hostile questions from fellow journalists.</p>
<p>&quot;I would much rather run the trench lines... or tackle Sniper's Alley (in Sarajevo) in my armoured vehicle Miss Piggy than be going through this. I really would.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the scariest things that ever happened to me, and I wouldn't be doing this unless I really believed that people wanted me to do it,&quot; Bell said.</p>
<p>Hamilton has denied taking cash for questions and Bell said he would not fight a negative camapign against him. But he said voters in Tatton, including many Conservatives, were dismayed by the weight of the charges levelled against Hamilton.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a certain amount of stuff out there -- admitted wrongdoing, admitted bad judgement, admitted mendacity -- and this is what is upsetting people, including his own people,&quot; Bell said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Hamilton accused Bell of being a Labour stooge and an anti-fair play candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;We know nothing of Mr Bell's opinions, save one -- he is against the basic principle of British justice, that a man is innocent unless proven guilty. He condemns me without seeing the evidence,&quot; Hamilton said.</p>
<p>Bell was a Liberal campaigner while a student but said he dropped all political allegiances in 1962 when he joined the BBC, which has given him leave to fight the election campaign.</p>
<p>Bell hung up his flak jacket last year and returned home declaring he had had enough of war reporting.</p>
<p>He has since criticised BBC policies of neutrality in reporting war and genocide, saying he did not believe journalists should stand neutral between good and evil.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes we have to get off our backsides and help people,&quot; Bell said on Monday.</p>
<p>He promised to make his tax returns and bank accounts available and said a reporter was right to grill him on who had paid for the room where the news conference was being held.</p>
<p>Told that Labour had picked up the 375 pound ($612) bill, Bell said he would send off a cheque right away.</p>
