<p>Germany's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), casting aside concerns about inflaming racist sentiment, called on Wednesday for stricter limits on foreign workers as part of a new strategy to cut unemployment.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel, chairman of the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), said it was &quot;grotesque&quot; that millions of Germans were unemployed while so many foreigners were working here.</p>
<p>CSU parliamentary leader Michael Glos said the party's aim was to stop the immigration of foreigners from outside the European Union. Four million Germans are jobless while more than one million foreigners receive work permits each year, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the problem of high unemployment among Germans but at the same time we employ many foreigners,&quot; Waigel said in an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. &quot;It should be legitimate to look at ways to make sure Germans get the jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>The CSU, the most right-wing of Germany's mainstream parties and a junior partner in Kohl's ruling coalition, has long been noted for its arch-conservative views.</p>
<p>But the Bavarians and other major parties have long refrained from directly linking the high 10 percent unemployment level to the eight million foreign residents, in part because they want to avoid being accused of fomenting racial unrest.</p>
<p>They have been especially careful since xenophobic violence erupted in Germany in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>&quot;It is schizophrenic that we give so many jobs to foreigners each year only because Germans don't want to do this work,&quot; Waigel said. &quot;German employers keep telling us they need, for example, seasonal workers from Poland. I call that grotesque.&quot;</p>
<p>Monika Hohlmeier, a vice chairman of the CSU and daughter of former CSU leader Franz Josef Strauss, said it was outrageous that unemployed Germans were turning down jobs that could ultimately only be filled by foreigners.</p>
<p>&quot;I consider it an outrage that, with four million unemployed, we are still issuing work permits for non-EU foreigners for jobs that Germans are apparently unwilling to take even though they are healthy,&quot; she told WDR radio.</p>
<p>But Guido Westerwelle, general secretary of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), said the CSU's efforts to cut unemployment by taking aim at the foreigners was misguided.</p>
<p>&quot;It is wrong from a social and economic point of view,&quot; Westerwelle said in a statement in Bonn.</p>
<p>Glos told ARD television the CSU was drawing up legislation that would force jobless Germans to accept work.</p>
<p>The interior ministry in Bonn, meanwhile, said the number of foreigners seeking asylum reached its lowest level in the six-year history of unified Germany. But it said the figure was still too high.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers in 1996 totalled 116,397, nine percent fewer than in 1995, and the lowest level since 1989, when the former West Germany received 103,000 applications for asylum.</p>
<p>Asylum requests have fallen sharply since 1993 when Kohl's government tightened what were previously Europe's most liberal asylum laws to stop an influx of economic refugees.</p>
