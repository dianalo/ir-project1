<p>A man convicted of abducting, raping and murdering a Lubbock, Texas woman in 1977 was executed by lethal injection Tuesday at the state prison, a prison spokesman said.</p>
<p>Clarence Allen Lackey, 42, was convicted of killing Diane Kumph by slashing her throat with a knife in July 1977, five months after he was released from prison on a previous burglary and attempted rape conviction, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to thank my Lord Jesus Christ for keeping me strong all these years. I would also like to thank my mother for standing by me all these years ... I love you mom,&quot; Lackey said as he lay strapped to a prison gurney with a bible on his chest. He was injected with a dose of lethal chemicals and died shortly after 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT).</p>
<p>Kumph's partially nude and severly beaten body was found on a dirt road near Lackey's house, prosecutors said. Traces of her blood and hair were found in Lackey's house and truck, and bloodstains on his boots matched her bloodtype.</p>
<p>Lackey's roommate, Carol Johnson, testified she found blood all over their house after coming home from work the day of the murder. She said Lackey admitted to killing the woman after hearing radio reports about the search for the killer.</p>
<p>&quot;Baby, I've got to tell you something -- I'm the one they are looking for,&quot; Johnson testified Lackey said to her.</p>
<p>Lackey had been released from prison five months before the murder after serving two years of a five-year sentence for burglary with intent to commit rape, prosecutors said. He spent the past 19 years on the Texas death row.</p>
<p>The execution was the 13th in Texas this year and the 120th since executions resumed in Texas in 1982. The state leads the nation in executions since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.</p>
<p>With two more executions scheduled this week and up to eight more docketed for June, Texas is on pace by mid-year to eclipse 1995's record 19 executions in a year, prison officials said.</p>
