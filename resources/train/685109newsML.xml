<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/IBM busy as stock holds ground.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Options on shares of International Business Machines Corp were busy Tuesday as the stock struggled to hold firm in the face of a sharp market selloff.</p>
<p>In afternoon trading, as the bellwether Dow industrial average .DJI was down 77 points at 7,681, IBM was up 1/4 at 92-1/16.</p>
<p>The stock, which had rallied to a new year high at 93-3/4, traded more than 4.5 million shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;IBM was strong again in the morning and only grudgingly giving up ground,&quot; said Jon Najarian, president of Mercury Trading, the designated primary market maker in IBM options.</p>
<p>Most of the action in IBM options was in the July series, but the January 1998 95 call traded a heavy 3,890 contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody's placing a big bet,&quot; Najarian said, adding that most of those calls traded when the stock was at its highs for the day.</p>
<p>Among the other options, the July 90 calls traded more than 5,600 contracts, the July 95 calls traded nearly 4,400 and the July 90 puts traded 3,490.  </p>
<p>Options on another technology stock, Micron Technology Inc, also were active as that stock rallied in the face of the broader selloff.</p>
<p>Micron shares gained 1-9/16 to 42-1/2 on more than 10 million shares.</p>
<p>Earlier, Merrill Lynch said it reiterated Micron as an intermediate and long term buy.</p>
<p>Most of the Micron options activity crossed at the Pacific Exchange. The options trade both there and at the Chicago Board Options exchange.  </p>
<p>Activity in Micron options was highlighted by the July 45 calls, which traded a total of about 8,520 contracts.</p>
<p>The July 50 calls traded 3,635 and the July 42-1/2 calls traded 3,765.</p>
<p>Among Micron puts, the July 42-1/2 traded around 1,620 contracts and the 37-1/2 37-1/2 traded 1,420.</p>
