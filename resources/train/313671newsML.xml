<title>CAMBODIA: Swiss firm declines to enforce Cambodian log ban.</title>

<p>A Swiss firm hired to perform pre-shipment inspections has declined to help Cambodia enforce its new log exports ban, renewing concerns over the fate of the country's dwindling forest reserves, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Cargo Superintendents Ltd, a subsidiary of Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), said it was uncomfortable fulfilling a government request to submit a proposal on policing illegal logging.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not a law enforcement agency, and we are not a paramilitary force,&quot; said Richard Hines, chief executive for SGS in Cambodia.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought we could be getting into a situation where that role could be asked of us,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The government hired the Swiss company to monitor the country's borders, as part of official measures to enforce the December 31 ban on log exports.</p>
<p>The SGS decision could harm the government's ability to enforce the rule, analysts said.</p>
<p>It may also weaken the government's case to donors, who have become increasingly impatient with the government's forestry policy, they noted. The International Monetary Fund cancelled a $20 million loan to Cambodia last November, citing a lack of transparency in the government's forestry policy and accounting for logging revenues.</p>
<p>Heavy logging and forestry concessions have raised an outcry from international groups and some Cambodian politicians.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Consultative Group of multilateral and bilateral donors met with top government officials to discuss Cambodia's progress on a number of fronts, including logging.</p>
<p>In a statement on Thursday the government called the SGS decision &quot;an unfortunate setback for the forestry policy.&quot;</p>
<p>But it added that the government &quot;remains strongly committed to put in place, as soon as possible, an effective control and monitoring system for forest exploitation.&quot;</p>
<p>Cambodia, once one of the world's most heavily forested countries, has lost more than three million hectares (7.4 million acres) of forest in the past three decades, according to the World Bank and United Nations.</p>
<p>The nation has conceded most of its remaining reserves to foreign logging firms, but has vowed to pursue a more sustainable forest management policy.</p>
