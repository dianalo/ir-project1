<p>Athletics in the United States has been hit by two more positive drug tests just days after the emergence of cases involving leading Americans Sandra Farmer-Patrick and Mary Slaney.</p>
<p>Athletics sources said on Wednesday that the U.S. Track and Field association was expected to report the new cases to the sport's governing body, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), in the next few days.</p>
<p>IAAF officials attending a meeting here were unable to confirm the positive tests.</p>
<p>But one source close to the cases told Reuters: &quot;There are two new positive tests in addition to the Farmer-Patrick and Mary Slaney cases. They are not big-name athletes but definitely from the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>The sources were unable to name the substances involved in the cases or when the athletes were caught. But the emergence of the positive tests is a further blow to American athletics at a time when authorities are under fire for their handling of drug-testing procedures.</p>
<p>U.S. Track and Field authorities were criticised by the IAAF on Tuesday for dragging their feet over the cases of Farmer-Patrick and Slaney who tested positive several months before last year's Atlanta Olympics in August.</p>
<p>Farmer-Patrick was allowed to take part in the Atlanta Games and has only just been banned for four years for steroid abuse.</p>
<p>The Slaney case has yet to be concluded almost a year after she was found to have high levels of the banned substance testosterone in the body during a test at the U.S. trials.</p>
<p>Her lawyer confirmed last week that a sample had shown a ratio higher than that at which an athlete faces suspension but added: &quot;There has not been a suspension and we do not expect her to be suspended.&quot;</p>
<p>Briton Diane Modahl, suspended after a high level showed up in a test in 1994, successfully appealed against a four-year-ban after arguing that the sample had been degraded following storage in excessively hot conditions.</p>
