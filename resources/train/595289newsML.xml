<p>A severe cyclone from the Bay of Bengal lashed the Bangladesh coast on Monday afternoon, sweeping Cox's Bazar and Teknaf areas with winds of more that 200 kph (124 mph), officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The core of the cyclone has yet to arrive but the windspeed has already passed 200 kph,&quot; district administrator Ali Imam Majumder said, quoting the local weather office.</p>
<p>&quot;Vast areas have been affected with electricity supply and telecommunications disrupted. Many houses have been destroyed and we can see sheets of tin from roof tops flying like tree leaves,&quot; Majumder told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Widespread damage is feared but we still don't have reports of casualties. Things would become clear once the storm is fully over,&quot; an eyewitness in Cox's Bazar, Nurul Islam, said.</p>
<p>Weather officials said the core of the cyclone, which they feared could trigger a tidal surge of up to five metres (15 ft), had yet to reach the mainland.</p>
<p>They said Chittagong port city was also battered by 80 kph (50 mph) winds and rain. No details were available immediately.</p>
