<p>Toronto stocks rolled to another record close on Wednesday, buoyed by firmer gold and base metal prices.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 10.64 points to close at 6248.86, the 10th record close of 1997. It also set a new intra-day high of 6260.73 points.</p>
<p>Trading was heavy with volume of 128.5 million shares worth C$1.97 billion ($1.44 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of that comes from the golds,&quot; said Dunnery Best, Midland Walwyn's director of private client investment. &quot;All the golds across the border are looking stronger,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Toronto's heavyweight gold group added over one percent while the base metal sector rose nearly two percent.</p>
<p>They led gains in nine of 14 sub-indices. The weak side was led by oils, transportation and banks.</p>
<p>&quot;The base metals did a good job,&quot; Best added, noting that mining stocks improved as base metal prices strengthened on declining supply.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered declines 561 to 448 with 282 stocks unchanged.</p>
<p>Canadian stocks virtually ignored Canada's 1997/98 federal budget released on Tuesday, which introduced no major initiatives that would affect publicly-traded companies.</p>
<p>Among hot gold stocks, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. recouped some its losses since announcing an agreement on the division of the Busang gold discovery in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Bre-X rose 0.70 to close at 21.50 on 7.7 million shares after chief executive David Walsh said he would not rule out a deal with a potential suitor for the right price.</p>
<p>In base metals, Rio Algom Ltd. jumped 1.50 to close at 53.50 after earlier hitting a 52-week high of 54.</p>
<p>Nickel producer Inco Ltd. finished up 0.85 at 48.20 after reaching a 52-week peak of 48.90.</p>
<p>National Bank of Canada edged 0.05 higher to 16 after kicking off the first quarter earnings parade of Canada's six major banks.</p>
<p>National Bank reported a 12 percent increase in net income for the quarter ended January 31 and raised its dividend.</p>
