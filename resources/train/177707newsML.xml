<title>USA: COMEX copper ends sharply higher ahead of LME data.</title>

<p>COMEX copper ended sharply higher, evidence that a large drawdown from LME stocks was due Friday, traders suggested.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts added that overnight weakness in the dollar probably encouraged international consumers to buy metals priced in other currencies such as the yen.</p>
<p>Many in the market are watching how much, if any copper will move into the LME's warehouse in Singapore, seized on as proof that some of the metal shipped from Europe to the Far East was not for consumption.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have mixed opinions how much more copper is going to the Far East,&quot; said Rich Hirsch of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty apparent this stuff is not being purchased to be buried in a cave out there,&quot; Hirsch said. &quot;It's going to be consumed sooner rather than later. For the bears to say all this stuff is going into the warehouse, it's quite a spin they are putting on it.&quot;</p>
<p>December COMEX settled 2.90 cents firmer at 95.55 cents per pound, traded 95.95 to 93.95 cents. Volume was estimated at 14,000 lots compared to Wednesday's 4,736 lots.</p>
<p>COMEX stocks fell 414 short tons Thursday to 31,029 tons.</p>
<p>Bloomsbury Minerals Economics said Thursday that substantial drawdowns in LME copper stocks since October do not reflect a fundamental market deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;Close to 100 percent of the October LME stock drawdown reflected re-location (mainly from Western Europe to China, but also to the U.S., Korea and elsewhere), not some huge instantaneous global market deficit,&quot; BME said.</p>
