<p>An overwhelming majority of Kazakhs believe official corruption is rife in the former Soviet republic, according to an opinion poll published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The poll, which canvassed 1,500 people and was carried out by the Washington-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems last December, showed 91 percent of the 16.9 million population considered government corruption a &quot;serious problem&quot;.</p>
<p>The poll also found 82 percent of Kazakhs &quot;dissatisfied&quot; with the situation in the oil-rich country, up from 77 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Kazakhs were also deeply pessimistic about any economic improvement, with 44 percent saying the economy would worsen in the next six months, 36 percent saying it would stay the same and only 10 percent believing it would improve.</p>
<p>The figures will be bad news for Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose popularity has plummeted due to the country's chronic backlog of unpaid wages and pensions.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev has given his prime minister, Akezhan Kazhegeldin, until April 10 to redress the payments crisis or face the sack.</p>
<p>But pollster Craig Charney said the survey, with a margin of error of two percent, actually showed the population in favour of speeding up market reforms, with 52 percent in favour of quickening the pace versus 19 percent who believe reform is too fast.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the hardships they have faced, the Kazakh public are more willing, not less, to face more reform,&quot; Charney said. &quot;Step on the accelerator, not the brakes is the message.&quot;</p>
<p>However, roughly half of Kazakhs still want full state control of the economy, according to the poll.</p>
<p>The poll also showed Kazakhs want greater political freedom, with 59 percent of the population against strict political controls to maintain law and order. Nazarbayev has sweeping executive powers and tolerates little dissent</p>
