<p>Former world number one Mats Wilander and Czech Karel Novacek were banned from tennis for three months on Wednesday after dropping their legal fight over drugs tests which showed the presence of cocaine in their blood.</p>
<p>The International Tennis Federation (ITF) said the pair had acknowledged the positive results of dope tests taken during the 1995 French Open but said they believed the cocaine was unwittingly consumed.  </p>
<p>&quot;Mr Wilander and Mr Novacek state that they were unaware of the presence of cocaine in their bodies and believe that the cocaine was unknowingly consumed,&quot; the ITF said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;They acknowledge the identity of the urine samples in question as their own and they acknowledge the positive results from the 1995 French Open tests,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The ITF said the two men had been ordered to return all prize money earned at the 1995 French Open and since -- amounting to $289,005 for Wilander and $185,765 for Novacek.</p>
<p>Wilander won the Roland Garros event three times, as well as the Australian Open three times and the U.S. Open once but he played in only 13 tournaments last year. Novacek, a U.S. Open semifinalist in 1994, last played a Grand Slam event in 1995.</p>
