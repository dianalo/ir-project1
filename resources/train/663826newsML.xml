<p>Fire-fighting experts from Singapore and the United States were on their way to Bangladesh on Monday to battle a raging fire at a gas field where U.S. firm Occidental Petroleum Corp began drilling this month.</p>
<p>&quot;They are expected any moment and will immediately try to extinguish the blaze,&quot; an official in northeastern Moulvi Bazar district, where the field is located, told reporters on Monday.</p>
<p>Officials with the state-owned oil and gas company Petrobangla said the government was keeping a chartered plane on standby to fly the foreign experts to the blazing field.</p>
<p>Four Bangladeshis were injured in the fire, which broke out on a rig at the drilling site at the Magurchhara gas field after an explosion early on Sunday.</p>
<p>Energy Ministry officials said the accident occurred when the rig's pipeline hit a &quot;trap gas&quot; layer at a depth of 840 metres (2,755 feet), destroying all the equipment and sending flames shooting high into the air.</p>
<p>The Petrobangla officials said Occidental was drilling a development well for gas in the area, which they believed holds substantial reserves of hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, due to return home on Monday from Istanbul where she attended the Developing-8 Islamic summit, has ordered &quot;immediate steps&quot; to put out the fire and investigate the cause, state-run Radio Bangladesh said.</p>
<p>The radio quoted unidentified Occidental officials in Moulvi Bazar as saying that &quot;all measures have been taken to extinguish the fire&quot;. Occidental officials in Dhaka could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Experts with fire fighting equipment from Singapore were due to arrive on Monday to try to extinguish the blaze, Energy Secretary Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said another expert team from Occidental's headquarters in Houston, Texas, would arrive shortly to assess the extent of damage and find out when drilling could be resumed.</p>
<p>Petrobangla chairman Mosharraf Hossain told Reuters on Sunday night that the fire was caused by leakage.</p>
<p>&quot;We are uncertain when drilling will resume but expect the blaze will die down soon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Journalists said the fire had spread over a two km (1.2 mile) area around the gas field, 20 km (12 miles) from Moulvi Bazar. Police surrounded the area and prohibited visits except by experts and officials.</p>
<p>Workers at two nearby tea gardens and thousands of villagers fled in panic, they said. Railway tracks passing by the gas field also caught fire, disrupting train services.</p>
<p>Petrobangla officials told newspapers on Sunday night that there was no cause for panic or too much concern. &quot;Things will come under control soon,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Occidental won the right to explore for hydrocarbons in the Sylhet region bordering India's Meghalaya and Assam states and began drilling in the field on June 2. It has a production sharing contract with the Bangladesh government.</p>
<p>Occidental said it would spend up to $100 million in exploring three out of 23 blocs that Bangladesh has earmarked for foreign firms.</p>
