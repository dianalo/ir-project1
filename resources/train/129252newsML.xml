<p>A year after Yigal Amir murdered Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the assassin's family is convinced his release is imminent.</p>
<p>Based on their scenario, fresh waves of Arab-Israeli violence sparked by Rabin's bankrupt peace deals will generate public sympathy for Amir -- serving a life term plus 11 years for the assassination -- and force his release.</p>
<p>The outcry, they say, has already begun.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt he will be released within a year or two,&quot; said Amir's mother Geula, sitting in the sparsely furnished livingroom of the family's middle class home where Yigal was raised in a strictly religious Jewish environment.</p>
<p>His father Shlomo and sister Hadas, one of eight children, nod in agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;When he comes out it will happen in a big way. He won't just be pardoned and released quietly...People will rally around him. They're already beginning to understand why he did what he did,&quot; Shlomo Amir told Reuters during a family interview.</p>
<p>As proof they produce a folder of letters, some of the thousands they have received from people in Israel and abroad voicing support for the 26-year-old Amir and his family.</p>
<p>&quot;What Rabin did brought tragedy to the Jewish people. He caused the deaths of many Jews and not only settlers,&quot; writes a Tel Aviv resident to Yigal in prison in a letter in February.</p>
<p>&quot;Your execution of Rabin was a brave and selfless act. Many people support you but are scared to say so as this country is rapidly spiraling into a police state.&quot;</p>
<p>Yigal Amir shot Rabin dead at a Tel Aviv peace rally last November 4 to try to prevent Israel giving Palestinians control over parts of the West Bank under a deal many religious Jews view as a sacrilege. Amir argued in court that Jewish law dictated the killing.</p>
<p>Shlomo and Geula Amir, ultra-nationalists who oppose any compromise with the Arabs, deny educating their son to violence. They identify with Yigal's motives but are careful not to condone his actions.</p>
<p>Others are less cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;You wouldn't believe how much support there is for Yigal. Not only in Israel but in the United States and everywhere else,&quot; said a neighbour, entering the Amir home clutching the hand of her nine-year-old American cousin who was anxious to meet family members of the man who killed Rabin.</p>
<p>Neighbours continue to send their children to the pre-school Geula Amir runs in her backyard. Attendance dropped from 37 to 17 in the days after the assassination, but this year it's back up to 30.</p>
<p>The support contrasts with the shock and outrage Israelis voiced in the weeks and months after the murder and is testimony to the country's huge political and cultural schisms.</p>
<p>&quot;The incident was a blow for the family but it could have been worse. He managed to survive which is a miracle in itself,&quot; said Shlomo Amir, a bearded man who proudly shows off a large bookcase full of religious texts.</p>
<p>&quot;My son is alive and he's studying Torah most of the day. That's conforting.&quot;</p>
<p>Members of the family seize on minor but nagging questions surrounding the assassination as proof that Israel's Shin Bet security service, responsible for protecting Rabin, had a hand in the murder.</p>
<p>They doubt Yigal's bullets were those that felled Rabin.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly there was a conspiracy. Someone in the Shin Bet wanted Rabin dead. They knew what Yigal was planning and they let him go ahead with it. A second gunman was there to make sure Rabin was killed,&quot; said Shlomo Amir.</p>
<p>Israeli courts have ruled that Yigal Amir was the sole gunman and a state probe, while censuring the Shin Bet for ignoring signs of a possible assassination, found no evidence linking agency officials to the killing.</p>
<p>Shlomo Amir said proof of the conspiracy would have been uncovered had the family been able to afford better lawyers. Two court-appointed attorneys represented Yigal Amir at no cost.</p>
<p>The family owes $50,000 to the lawyer who defended Hagai Amir, his brother sentenced to 12 years for helping Yigal plot the murder, and has no money to pay him. Reports that right-wing Jews raised funds in the United States for the brothers were false, Shlomo Amir said.</p>
<p>But the conspiracy theory is refuted by an amateur video showing Yigal Amir pulling the trigger and by Amir himself who took pride in the murder again and again in court.</p>
<p>&quot;He once said to me that he knew he had sinned and would have to pay the price. But he said he spent two years bottled up with the feeling that he had to stop Rabin,&quot; said Geula Amir.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think he'll ever regret it,&quot; she said.</p>
