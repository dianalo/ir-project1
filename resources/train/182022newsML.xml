<p>Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army said on Tuesday it had killed a rebel Hutu commander, inflicting a fresh defeat on foes already reeling from the loss of strategic bases in Zaire.</p>
<p>An army officer and local peasants said the Hutu rebel leader in the province around the capital Bujumbura, known as Isaac, died in a six-hour battle at Basekeza hill, 17 km (11 miles) southeast of the city, on Monday.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the army strafed the area from a light aircraft.</p>
<p>The death represents a further setback for Hutu rebels, mainly from the Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD), who were driven from bases in refugee camps in East Zaire's Uvira region nearly four weeks ago.</p>
<p>They had used the camps along the border to launch raids into Burundi, where a Tutsi-led military regime took power in a coup on July 25.</p>
<p>Rebels fled Uvira camps along with 225,000 Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees because of fighting between Zairean Tutsis who now control much of east Zaire and the Zairean army.</p>
<p>Around 150,000 people, mainly civilians, have died in three years of civil war in Burundi, but there are no casualty figures for the latest fighting.</p>
<p>Plans for a Burundi peace conference next Thursday in Arusha, northern Tanzania, fell through on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Bujumbura said earlier that Julius Nyerere, the international mediator for Burundi, hoped to assemble FDD leader Leonard Nyangoma, the military regime and politicians.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the case until midday,&quot; Nyerere's aide Charles Sanga told Reuters in Tanzania.</p>
<p>&quot;But unforeseen circumstances transpired and it's been cancelled completely. Mwalimu (Nyerere) thought it would be a waste of time to persevere,&quot; Sanga said, declining to comment on the hitch.</p>
<p>Regional states imposed economic and political sanctions on Burundi after the July coup.</p>
