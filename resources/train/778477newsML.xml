<p>Yugoslavia's stalled, cash-starved economy may offer investors good business opportunities but political risk and a ring of sanctions stand in the way of unrestricted capital inflow, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Chances for foreign investment in Yugoslavia are great now that investors have nearly exhausted the most challenging opportunities in other transition economies,&quot; Miroljub Hadzic, assistant to the Serbian privatisation minister, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic sanctions did not give us a chance to open to the outside world, so there has been no investment in our telecom, power system, roads or industries, but we are not a hopeless case nor a desert island,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Hadzic insisted Yugoslavia offered highly-qualified and cheap labour, but also saw it attracting multinationals which have an established presence in neighbouring markets.</p>
<p>&quot;They miss (are lacking) exactly this territory to complete their regional presence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dusko Susnjar, Yugoslav representative of the Vienna-based EPIC (European Privatisation and Investment Corporation) said a huge political risk was keeping some investors at bay.</p>
<p>Even so, Susnjar was confident high risk could attract hot capital.</p>
<p>&quot;But there are not so many risk-prone investors and they are not desirable in developing countries. It is better to attract long-term capital which will stay and help the local economy to develop and progress.&quot;</p>
<p>Yugoslavia was a long way from attracting corporate investors as long as it lacked a capital market, he added.</p>
<p>Hadzic insisted the government's privatisation programme, to begin on October 31, will create opportunities for more equity investment. He said the law on concessions was also attracting foreign capital.</p>
<p>According to some unofficial estimates, around $1 billion in various foreign investment deals have been negotiated.</p>
<p>But those are mainly new joint ventures with majority foreign interests. While foreigners can offer cash, equipment and know-how, local firms provide premises and staff.</p>
<p>&quot;The concept of seeking strategic partners is essentially wrong. It gives concessions to the privileged and chokes competition. Strategic partnerships imply exclusivity. They may be good from a political standpoint, but not from a macro-economic point of view,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Serbia was also deliberately looking for dual strategic partners in order to reduce its own political risk, the analyst added.</p>
<p>Investment intentions were closely monitored by the government and politicians so that concrete deals do not collide with official economic policy, analysts said.</p>
<p>So far, investors included Italian and Greek companies, Hadzic said.</p>
<p>&quot;The French and the British are still exploring the market but will become more aggressive when the outer wall of sanctions falls. The Germans remain definitely on the sidelines even though most of our industry relies on their technology.&quot;</p>
