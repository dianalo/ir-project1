<p>Richmond Federal Reserve economist Raymond Owens said Tuesday respondents to its monthly manufacturing and service sector surveys report &quot;very modest&quot; price rises but no significant price pressures.</p>
<p>&quot;Respondents to these surveys have been reporting very modest price increases for some time now, perhaps too modest in the context of what we see in the real world,&quot; Owens said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>&quot;But nevertheless their predictions of very modest price increases month-to-month do perhaps mimic what we see in the overall in the economy rather well,&quot; he added. &quot;At this point they are not reporting any significant increase in price pressures.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted that manufacturers have reported some wage pressures in the past six months and that they anticipate more in the next six months. He added that wage pressures in the service sector were modest in the latest survey, but had been &quot;rather robust&quot; in previous months.</p>
<p>Owens said labor markets in the Richmond Fed district were tighter than is true nationally.</p>
<p>&quot;Labor conditions here are very, very tight and very pronounced and it is leading to wage pressures and extraordinary measures by some employers to find workers,&quot; Owens said. &quot;That is widespread here, that is not necessarily true nationwide.&quot;</p>
<p>Owens said the national economy appears to have good momentum going into 1997 and is not experiencing pronounced inflationary pressures. Although there has been little wage pressure from tightening labor markets, he said it was worth keeping a watchful eye on developments on that front.</p>
