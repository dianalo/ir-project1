<p>Seoul stocks are expected to fall slightly on Wednesday as a further consolidation is likely in the absence of market-boosting news, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market needs to consolidate further after sharp gains last week,&quot; said Chang Kun-woo of Daishin Securities. &quot;However, the fall would be limited as institutional investors are expected to continue buying,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The composite stock index closed Tuesday down 2.15 points to 762.92.</p>
<p>Brokers expected profit-taking to continue on shares that have risen sharply in the recent rally.  </p>
<p>Much of the market's attention would be given to stocks with favourable expectations of first-half earnings, they said. A majority of the company results are due on Friday.</p>
<p>Any development surrounding the troubled Kia Group would again be closely monitored, although investors were growing less sensitive to Kia-related rumours and news in the market, brokers said.</p>
