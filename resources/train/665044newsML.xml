<p>China's cotton output for the 1997/98 season is forecast to slump, hit by pests, bad weather and pollution, but imports would remain unchanged from 1996/97, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Industry sources placed China's 1997/98 cotton production at 17.2 million bales, down five percent from the estimated 1996/97 figure of 18.10 million bales.</p>
<p>In China, cotton is harvested around the end of September and delivered to the market from October through to the next northern summer.</p>
<p>The Yellow River valley had again been hit by worms, an attack almost as serious as during 1992/93, a bad season for the market. All growers in the region confirmed acute pest attacks, traders said.</p>
<p>In the traditional cotton-growing areas along the Yellow River, weevils and worms devastated the cotton crop late in the season, sources said. This slashed the Yellow River area's projected 1997/98 cotton output by 16 percent, or about 1.3 million bales. Particularly in the eastern province of Shandong and in Hebei, pests had played havoc. Late last season, growers abandoned many cotton fields and producers largely shifted to fruits and other commodities.</p>
<p>&quot;The cotton prices were good compared to other food commodities, but the yields are too low,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>In the southern growing regions of the Yellow River valley, a collapse in corn prices pushed farmers to increase their planted cotton acreage.</p>
<p>In Shandong and Hebei, cotton plant growth was stunted while cotton bolls were small and crimped, with farmers blaming soil saturated by chemicals.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a new phenomenon,&quot; said one cotton expert.</p>
<p>In the southern cotton provinces, farmers may have increased cotton acreage, switching from corn to cotton, but unfavourable weather cast doubt on yields, some sources said.</p>
<p>The 1997/98 production outlook for the southern region remained unchanged compared to 1996/97.</p>
<p>China's average yearly cotton production would shrink further to around 15 million bales in the next few years, some sources estimated.</p>
<p>China's total cotton offtake in 1997/98 was pegged at around 20.0 million bales, up from the 1996/97 estimate of 19.0 million bales.</p>
<p>Traders estimated that the average home use of cotton was around 15 percent of output and pegged the 1997/98 non-spinning use at 3.0 million bales and the remaining 17.0 million bales as mill use.</p>
<p>The spinning industry looked better this year, and cotton yarn exports had jumped 44 percent in January-March, compared to the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Slightly lower domestic cotton prices combined with cheaper imports will enable mills to manage,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Local grade one cotton was priced at between 17,000 and 18,000 yuan per tonne or 93-98 U.S. cents per pound, sources said.</p>
<p>China's cotton imports would likely remain at 2.6 million bales in 1997/98, unchanged from the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports are likely to continue,&quot; said one trader, noting that imported cotton still favoured mills' price calculations.</p>
<p>Joint venture mills, for example, paid 84 U.S. cents per pound for imported cotton, compared to 86.20 cents for local cotton, after import and value-added taxes (VAT), handling charges and VAT refunds.</p>
<p>If cotton prices rose above 87 cents per pound, then imports would likely decline, one source said. But domestic cotton prices could also increase in line with international prices.</p>
<p>The New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE) July contract closed 0.23 cent weaker at 73.15 cents per pound on Friday.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, China had imported about 6.65 million bales, or 66 percent of its cotton from the United States, 11 percent from the CIS and 7.5 percent from Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;Competitive Australian pricing in cotton has allowed it to make inroads into the China market,&quot; one source noted, adding that for the moment Australian and West African cotton was almost sold out and that China would turn to the United States for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>The U.S. cotton marketing year is August 1 to July 31.</p>
<p>Cotton carry out of 1997/98 was forecast at 12.05 million bales, down from 12.35 million bales this year.</p>
<p>China's apparently massive cotton stocks, estimated by some international statistical services at 20 million bales -- or one year's consumption -- could well be much lower, and closer to 12 million bales, some traders said, noting that China's cotton stocks were a well-kept secret.</p>
<p>But some traders noted that strategically, the Chinese government preferred to keep sufficient stocks, and this was the reason for continued good imports, which would allow the government to build up stocks rather than be caught short during lean harvests. -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6358. http://www.hk97.com</p>
