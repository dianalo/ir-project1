<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange posted another record close on Wednesday on the back of stronger financial service and conglomerate stocks.</p>
<p>The TSE's key 300 Composite Index rose 10.85 points to 5986.41 in heavy trading. Trading volume was 108.2 million shares worth C$1.9 billion (US$1.4 billion).</p>
<p>Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, eight rose led by conglomerates, banks, pipelines and media.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an interest-sensitive area and where buyers tend to conglomerate,&quot; said ScotiaMcLeod senior vice-president Fred Ketchen.</p>
<p>Falling sectors included oils, transports and real estate.</p>
<p>Barrick Gold Corp. led Toronto's active issues after news on Tuesday of a deal which will give it a majority share in a rich Indonesian gold deposit.</p>
<p>One dealer said he had only traded Barrick -- the world's third largest gold producer -- and Bre-X Minerals Ltd. which discovered the Busang gold deposit.</p>
<p>&quot;I think both are buys at this point in time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bank stocks were snapped up by investors as Canada's Big Six banks began reporting year-end earnings this week.</p>
<p>Bank of Nova Scotia posted its first C$1 billion ($750 million) annual profit on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On the broader market, declining stocks edged out advances 556 to 437, despite gains in the key index. Another 294 shares were unchanged.</p>
<p>U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Barrick Gold rose 0.75 to 39.65 on more than 7.1 million shares, while Bre-X Minerals gained 0.65 to 21 on 6.5 million shares.</p>
<p>* Bank of Nova Scotia climbed 0.20 to 46.05 on 745,000 shares. Toronto-Dominion Bank jumped 0.80 to 36.85 in heavy turnover of 1.3 million shares.</p>
<p>T-D Bank is scheduled to report its fourth quarter results on Thursday.</p>
<p>* Newbridge Networks Corp. jumped 1 to 38.60 on 1.5 million shares. The stock regained some lost ground since analysts' downgraded Newbridge last week.</p>
