<p>Tracy Murray scored 16 of his season-high 22 points in the fourth quarter Thursday as the Washington Bullets knocked the Miami Heat out of first place in the Atlantic Division, 99-95.</p>
<p>Murray made four three-pointers in the final period. He hit a three-pointer with 2:54 to play to draw Washington within 88-87. He drained another three-pointer on the Bullets' next possesion and Washington never gave up the lead.</p>
<p>Rod Strickland, who hit three crucial free throws in the final seconds to seal the victory, had 19 points for Washington, which has won three straight but is 4 1/2 games out of the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>The Heat had a chance to tie the game with three seconds to go but Voshon Lenard's three-pointer rimmed out and Strickland came down with the rebound.</p>
<p>&quot;Our backs are against the wall,&quot; Murray said. &quot;There is a sense of urgency. The way we played tonight in the second half, if we can keep it up we can win most of our games.&quot;</p>
<p>Isaac Austin scored a career-high 19 points and Jamal Mashburn also had 19 for Miami, which fell a half game behind the New York Knicks atop the Atlantic Division.</p>
<p>The Heat, out of first for the first time since January 15, have played their last six games without All-Star centre Alonzo Mourning, who is out with a foot injury.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a lead we should have kept,&quot; Heat coach Pat Riley said. &quot;They kept their offence alive by hitting the boards, keeping the ball alive and kicking the ball out.&quot;</p>
<p>Without Mourning, the Heat was beaten on the boards 52-41 and shot just 40 percent (33-of-82) from the floor. Miami also got just 14 points from its bench.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a terrible loss, that sums it up,&quot; Miami forward P.J. Brown said. &quot;It's probably the worst loss of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>In Charlotte, Glen Rice set a franchise record with 48 points and Vlade Divac added four of his 23 and a key defensive play in overtime as the Hornets defeated the Boston Celtics 122-121.</p>
<p>Anthony Mason had his second straight triple-double and fourth of the season with 19 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists for Charlotte. The Hornets have won four straight and nine of their last 10.</p>
<p>Divac just missed a triple-double with 18 rebounds and nine assists.</p>
<p>&quot;Anthony Mason was really good, got a triple-double,&quot; Charlotte coach Dave Cowens said. &quot;All these records were falling. We almost had two guys that had triple-doubles in the same night, which would have been pretty outstanding.&quot;</p>
<p>Eric Williams scored 25 points and Antoine Walker 20 for the Celtics, who blew an eight-point lead in the final four minutes of the fourth quarter and fell to 3-29 on the road.</p>
<p>On their last possession, the Celtics threw the ball in to Williams, but Divac tipped it to Dell Curry and the Hornets ran out the clock.</p>
<p>&quot;I was passing the ball,&quot; Williams said. &quot;He just made a great play. He has been in the league a long time and is playing well for Charlotte. He has long arms and he just reached around and knocked the ball away. He had to make a great play, otherwise we had a layup.&quot;</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Penny Hardaway scored 21 points and Dennis Scott added 19 as the Orlando Magic edged the Clippers 94-93 for their eighth win in nine games.</p>
<p>Loy Vaught had 28 points and 12 rebounds and Darrick Martin finished with 16 points for the Clippers, who went down to their third straight loss.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, the Atlanta Hawks led from start to finish, cruising to a 117-104 victory over the 76ers.</p>
<p>Steve Smith had 25 points and a season-high 10 assists and Christian Laettner added 23 points for Atlanta, which has won eight of its last 11 games.</p>
<p>Derrick Coleman scored 23 points and Allen Iverson 20 for Philadelphia, which has lost three straight and fell to 8-22 at home.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, Sam Cassell had 26 points and 10 assists before leaving with a leg cramp in the final minute as the New Jersey Nets scored a 102-96 victory over the Grizzlies, snapping a six-game road losing streak.</p>
<p>Kendall Gill scored 22 points and rookie Kerry Kittles 21 for the Nets, who won for just the third time in their last nine games but improved to 3-0 all-time against Vancouver.</p>
<p>Anthony Peeler scored 24 points and Shareef Abdur-Rahim 23 for the Grizzlies, who suffered their eighth straight loss.</p>
