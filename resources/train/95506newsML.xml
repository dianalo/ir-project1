<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said in a newspaper interview on Thursday that a Europe without Italy would be weakened.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced that the future of Italy is with Europe,&quot; he said in an interview with daily Le Figaro.</p>
<p>&quot;I am also convinced that without Italy Europe would be weakened, continually submitted to trade turbulence and serious political problems,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Italy is the leading edge of Mediterranean Europe. Everybody, beginning with France, needs a stable and united Italy,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Prodi said it would be unrealistic to change the Maastricht treaty terms on European Economic and Monetary Union and reaffirmed a denial that he had sought to convince Spain to help Italy soften the criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;That idea never entered my head,&quot; he said in the interview. &quot;I think it would be unrealistic to change the Maastricht rules, whether they are good or bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Many other measures could have been taken into account. Notably efforts achieved by different countries to meet convergence criteria. But I believe that the treaty is sacred and must be respected,&quot; he added.</p>
