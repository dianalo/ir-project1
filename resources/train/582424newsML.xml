<headline>Costello sees long period of growth for Australia.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday that Australia had to prepare itself for an extra long period of economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that what we ought to be looking at in this country is setting ourselves up for a long economic cycle,&quot; he told a post-Budget business dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want the boom and bust of the 1980s,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But if we can keep inflation low and interest rates low and address our savings problem, absent some major intervention from overseas, it could be a very long cycle that we haven't seen for quite some time in this country,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Costello on Tuesday announced the Federal budget for the year to June 1998 and in doing so projected economic growth continuing until fiscal 2000/01.</p>
<p>If the forecasts were met, the economy will have sustained 10 unbroken years of solid economic growth.</p>
<p>The Australian economy historically has had difficulty sustaining growth for longer than five or six years.</p>
<p>Usually an expansion phase is halted by a slump in commodity prices although in 1990 Australia preceded the world slowdown, entering a deep recession that economists blamed largely on an asset-price bubble bursting.</p>
