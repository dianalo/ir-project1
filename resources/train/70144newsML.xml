<p>Lithuanian Finance Minister Algimantas Krizhinauskas said on Monday a new syndicated loan the Baltic state is to sign was proof of investor confidence.</p>
<p>Lithuania is tomorrow to sign a deal with J.P. Morgan for a synidicated loan worth $75 million, priced at 2.25 basis points over LIBOR with a maturity of one year and one day.</p>
<p>&quot;This loan is a strong sign of confidence in our economy,&quot; Krizhinauskas told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It was negotiated before we received our credit rating and we still managed to get very favourable terms,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Lithuania was this month given a credit rating by Moody's, the first for a former Soviet state, and intends to get ratings from other international agencies. It got a Ba2 for foreign currency debt and Ba3 for bank deposits.</p>
<p>Tommorow's signing comes after the country in April arranged a $33 million syndicated loan via J.P. Morgan, that was priced at 2.50 bp over Libor.</p>
<p>Lithuania has several times tapped the international markets, seeking to cover its 700 million litas budget deficit.</p>
<p>Its debt has received a fairly good reception, although it has been dubbed the slowest reformer of the three Baltic states and was hit by a banking crisis last year.</p>
<p>Krizhinauskas, whose Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDLP) is facing defeat at forthcoming elections, said the aim of the loans was to reduce domestic borrowing costs.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall in domestic yields will benefit the business sector, because it will force our commercial banks to extend more credits to companies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They cannot make all of their profit from the local T-bill market any more,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>T-bill rates soared after the banking crisis but now range between nine and 12 percent.</p>
<p>Krizhinauskas said all of the deficit was now covered.</p>
<p>&quot;This government has not made any populist increases in public sector wages and salaries and so both the budget deficit and inflation have been kept down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lithuania did not suffer from inflation in August for the first time since it regained independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. The year-on-year rate was 24.3 percent.</p>
