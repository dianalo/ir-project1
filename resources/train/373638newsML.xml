<p>Police investigating a series of attacks on armoured security vans last summer have seized arms, ammunition, explosives, radio scanners and cash in raids in southern Belgium.</p>
<p>Police raided 50 locations around the southern and central cities of Charleroi, Mons, Philippeville and Mons on Tuesday, Belgian radio said.</p>
<p>It said a total of 90 assault and hunting rifles had been seized along with 4,000 rounds of ammunition, a kilogram of explosives, scanners and two million francs ($59,000) in cash.</p>
<p>About 30 people were questioned and 10 held for further investigation by magistrates.</p>
<p>In mid-January police seized assault rifles, machine guns, shotguns, pistols, knives, masks, hundreds of kilos of ammunition and explosives in another raid on an isolated farmhouse outside the central town of Nivelles.</p>
<p>There have been a series of attacks on security vans over the past year all over Belgium involving machine guns and assault rifles with armour-piercing ammunition.</p>
<p>Last July, after a particularly bloody string of attacks, all movement of money in security vans was briefly suspended -- causing massive build-ups of cash at supermarkets and causing a security crisis of its own.</p>
<p>Several people have been wounded and at least one killed.</p>
<p>In December bandits blew up two banks in attewmpts to get at their hole-in-the-wall cash dispensers -- resulting in one case in a shoot-out with police. There was another such attack last month.</p>
