<headline>LIFFE cocoa claws back lost ground to end firmer.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cocoa futures recovered some ground lost earlier in Thursday's session as traders took their cue from a bullish New York performance and covered short positions towards the close. Market sources said London's March contract slipped on long liquidation to test key chart support at 910 stg after hovering in a range between 922 and 925 stg during most of the earlier part of the day's trading.</p>
<p>But solid buying in the New York market prompted traders to cover short positions in the afternoon and the benchmark London position bounced higher to close six stg up on the day at 922 stg. Most other positions were also firmer.</p>
<p>&quot;The market saw good buying this morning -- the buying was set aside and it came off to 910 on long liquidation and back up again on shortcovering,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;New York was moving higher and you had very good short covering again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At the close London volume was fairly heavy at 10,996 lots but mainly comprised of December against actuals trades coupled with crosses on the December/March spread.</p>
<p>Only light interest was seen to trade cocoa options and 303 lots changed hands. Shortcovering purchases were noted in March puts at strikes of 950, 975 and 1,000 stg as players tried to protect themselves against downside move while the market fell.</p>
<p>Sustained interest was also noted in March 1,000 stg calls.</p>
