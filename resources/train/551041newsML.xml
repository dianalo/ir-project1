<headline>Finmeccanica head resigns amid acrimony.</headline>

<p>The outgoing chairman of state engineering company Finmeccanica told a shareholders' meeting on Wednesday that the group could fall prey to foreign predators if a radical restructuring plan went ahead.</p>
<p>Fabiano Fabiani confirmed to shareholders he would resign after Finmeccanica's parent company, state holding IRI, ordered him to reverse his industrial strategy which was aimed at bringing the group's empire under one umbrella.</p>
<p>In a damning condemnation of present management, IRI ordered that debt-ridden Finmeccanica be split into separate divisions controlled by a single holding company.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not able to accept the IRI statement, which I consider harmful to the position of the chairman and to my personal image,&quot; Fabiani told the shareholders' assembly.</p>
<p>Fabiani worked for four years to create a single huge conglomerate ahead of Finmeccanica's planned privatisation, but he failed to prevent group debt from soaring and unexpected 1996 losses prompted IRI to pounce last week.</p>
<p>IRI said the new structure would speed up the privatisation process and make it easier to forge strategic alliances for one of Italy's biggest industrial concerns. Fabiani warned it would lay the company open to foreign competitors.</p>
<p>Finmeccanica's privatisation is pencilled in for 1998 and IRI, which owns a little over 60 percent of the group, has not yet decided whether to sell off the firm's defence, aerospace, energy and transportation divisions separately.</p>
<p>Newspapers have speculated that last week's decision suggested this might be the eventual way forward.</p>
<p>&quot;This would mean the disappearance of the group and the transformation of even its best industrial concerns into divisions owned by competitors,&quot; Fabiani said, adding that Italy risked losing its influence in the world of high technology.</p>
<p>&quot;Men come and go...but the technical and technological assets of a country, once they have been weakened or even completely destroyed, cannot be put back together again easily,&quot; he told shareholders.</p>
<p>The IRI statement and the subsequent resignation of Fabiani, one of the last grandees of state Italian industry, has sparked controversy in the turbulent world of Rome politics.</p>
<p>Some government allies joined forces with the centre-right opposition and tried in vain to delay Wednesday's shareholder meeting. They also demanded that IRI present parliament with details of its new industrial plan for Finmeccanica.</p>
<p>The government, which has controversially ousted a number of senior directors from leading state companies over the past year, said on Wednesday it had asked IRI to reject Fabiani's resignation. IRI has not yet commented on the request.</p>
<p>During his time at the firm, Fabiani helped shape a group which controls around 70 percent of the domestic defence market and is involved in numerous international projects, including Eurofighter.</p>
<p>But he has been less successful taming the group's debt, which stood at 6.59 trillion lire ($3.8 billion) at the end of March compared with 5.1 trillion at end-1996.</p>
<p>Finmeccanica made a 540.4 billion lire loss in 1996 after a 40 billion lire profit in 1995.</p>
<p>$1 = 1,715 lire</p>
