<headline>SWIMMING-TOM DOLAN WINS 400 METERS AT U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS.</headline>
<dateline>NASHVILLE, Tenn.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tom Dolan, healthy for the first time since 1994, won the 400-meter individual medley Sunday at the U.S. Swimming National Championships.</p>
<p>Dolan, 21, the Olympic gold medallist, world record holder and world champion in the 400 individual medley, was on world record pace for the first 350 meters. He won in 4:17.13, fastest time in the world this year.</p>
<p>Dolan holds the world record of 4:12.30. It was only his third meet since the Olympics and first one he rested and shaved for.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm coming off a great summer of training,&quot; Dolan said. &quot;It's been an interesting year since the Olympics. It felt good to get in there and race again. It's tough when you get to where I am in the sport where you are pushed to go your best time. Unfortunately for me in this event that's a world record.&quot;</p>
<p>Dolan, an asthmatic, has had his share of health problems. Before the 1994 world championships trials, Dolan was having trouble breathing. He discovered his windpipe was unusually narrow. Still, he went on to win the world title.</p>
<p>Before the 1996 Olympic trials, he had chronic fatigue from overtraining. Still, he qualified in three Olympic events and went on to win a gold medal in the 400 individual medley.</p>
<p>Dolan qualified for the Jan. 8-18 world championships in Perth, Australia. The top two finishers in each event qualify for the worlds.</p>
<p>Olympian Cristina Teuscher won the 200-meter freestyle in 2:01.00. Teuscher finished a disappointing sixth in the event at the Olympics in Atlanta but came back to win a gold medal as a member of the 800-meter freestyle relay team, where she posted the fastest 200-meter freestyle split in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Kristy Kowal, 18, won the 100-meter breaststroke in 1:08.80.</p>
<p>Amanda Beard, 15, the American record holder in the 100-meter breaststroke, failed to reach the final in the event. Beard was ninth, missing the eight-swimmer final by 1/100th of a second. At the 1996 Olympics Beard earned silver medals in the 100 and 200 breaststroke events and was a member of the 400-meter medley relay.</p>
<p>Timothy Siciliano won the 800-meter freestyle in 8:02.83. It was his second national title. The 800 is not a world championship event.</p>
<p>The seven-day meet, which concludes Friday, is also serving as selection trials for the Pan Pacific Games in Japan Aug. 10-13 and the world university games Aug. 25-30 in Sicily.</p>
