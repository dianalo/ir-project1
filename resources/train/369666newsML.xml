<p>CBOT soymeal futures closed sharply higher on Tuesday while soyoil ended mixed with strength tied to a late rally in soybeans, traders said.</p>
<p>The March soymeal contract peaked at $242.50 per ton, the highest level since October 2. Traders said stops were hit above a technical resistance point at $237.50.</p>
<p>Trading was very quiet until the last hour of the session when wheat rallied on ideas U.S. wheat exports would pick up amid news of a shipping backlog in Canada. At least 38 vessels were waiting to be loaded at Canadian ports.</p>
<p>Activity was subdued ahead of Wednesday's USDA supply and demand report. Traders anticipated the report would include increases in soybean production estimates for Brazil in Argentina, countered by a cut in U.S. ending stocks.</p>
<p>The market shrugged off reports USDA's attache to Argentina raised the soybean output estimate by 500,000 tonnes to 13.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Soymeal ended $5.40 to $3.30 per ton higher with March up $5.40 at $242.10. Soyoil closed 0.10 cent per lb lower to 0.06 higher with March up 0.06 at 23.93.</p>
<p>On the day, R.J. O'Brien and Refco Inc were said to be buyers while Dean Witter was a seller.</p>
<p>Produce Grain was a buyer of March while Cargill Inc was on the sell-side, traders said.</p>
<p>Soymeal volume was estimated by CBOT at 13,000 lots, against Monday's actual volume of 10,051 lots. Soyoil volume was pegged at 8,500 lots against Monday's 8,373 lots.</p>
