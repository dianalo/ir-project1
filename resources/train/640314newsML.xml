<p>The number of Americans lining up to collect unemployment benefits for the first time jumped by 19,000 last week to the highest level in nearly a month, the government said Thursday.</p>
<p>Despite the Memorial Day holiday-shortened week, initial claims rose to 337,000 in the week ended May 31, the Labour Department said. That was up from 318,000 the week before and was the highest level for new state jobless claims since the week ended May 3, when claims totalled 348,000.</p>
<p>Wall Street economists had forecast new claims of 320,000 for the latest week.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the report) is suggesting that the economy hasn't strengthened that much in the latter half of the second quarter,&quot; said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.</p>
<p>But economists try to avoid reading too much into one week's figures. And Thayer noted that even though claims were not falling rapidly -- a sign of a strengthening economy -- they were still hovering at relatively low levels.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Federal Reserve will probably pay more attention to the department's report on May unemployment, due on Friday. Fed policy-makers meet in early July to weigh their next move on interest rates. The central bank held rates steady in May after raising them in March, the first increase in more than two years, in a bid to ward off inflation.</p>
<p>The four-week moving average of new jobless claims, seen as a more accurate gauge since it smooths out weekly fluctuations, fell to 323,750 from 326,000 the week before.</p>
<p>The four-week moving average was at its lowest since the week ended April 19, when it stood at 321,750, the department said.</p>
<p>The total number of workers continuing to collect benefits rose 77,000 to 2,303,000 in the week ended May 24, the latest week for which data were available, from a revised 2,226,000 the week before.</p>
<p>Four states reported decreases in claims exceeding 1,000 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended May 24: Ohio, Louisiana, Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Louisiana cited fewer layoffs in the transportation equipment industry. Tennessee reported fewer layoffs in manufacturing and other areas, including lumber, apparel, leather goods, and services.</p>
<p>Ohio and Kentucky had no comment on claims activity.</p>
<p>Three states reported increases in claims exceeding 1,000, for the May 24 week. They were Wisconsin, North Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>Wisconsin said it had layoffs in construction, trade and service industries, North Carolina reported layoffs in the furniture industry, while Georgia said it had layoffs in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>In another report, the Commerce Department said April completions of single-family homes rose 0.1 percent after a revised 9.1 percent drop in March and a revised 14.2 percent increase in February.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said single-family completions fell 12.0 percent in March and rose 13.4 percent in February.</p>
<p>April multi-family unit completions fell 1.0 percent after a revised 2.0 percent decline in March and a 20.6 percent increase in February. The department revised March multi-family unit completions from a 3.9 percent drop.</p>
