<p>China on Thursday urged the Philippines to stop immediately all activities on a cluster of disputed rocks in the South China Sea where the Philippine flag was raised, saying this would safeguard peace and stability.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government strongly urges the Philippines... to immediately stop all activities that violate China's territorial integrity,&quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;(We) strongly urge the Philippine side... to respect China's territorial sovereignty over the Huang Yan islands... so as to safeguard peace and stability in South China Sea and friendly relations between the two countries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Philippines calls the Huang Yan islands Scarborough Shoal.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Philippine President Fidel Ramos publicly repudiated Beijing's ownership of the disputed shoal after an hour-long meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing.</p>
<p>Located on the high seas 200 km (125 miles) west of Subic freeport near Manila, the shoal is a 16-km (10-mile) long rock formation which almost entirely vanishes at high tide, except for an outcrop big enough to accommodate just 12 people.</p>
<p>Philippine military officials say the shoal has served in recent years mainly as a transit point for small boats carrying smugglers and contraband to the Philippines' main island of Luzon in the north.</p>
<p>With an unclear economic value, the rock appears an odd prize for a contest between an Asian giant sitting on a huge land mass and a neighbour with more than 7,000 islands of its own.</p>
<p>China earlier this month protested against the flying of the Philippine flag on the shoal, calling it a &quot;serious violation&quot; of its sovereignty and demanding the flag's immediate removal.</p>
<p>Philippine fishermen hoisted the flag last month after the navy intercepted a Chinese government radio message instructing one of its ships in the area to raise China's flag on the rocky outcrop, a Philippine senior intelligence official has said.</p>
<p>Shen said China had already restrained itself.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese side has practised extreme restraint to safeguard friendly relations between the two countries,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ramos said the shoal was within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea &quot;and not an area where any other state can exercise sovereign right&quot;.</p>
<p>Shen rejected the exclusive economic zone argument, saying it was &quot;absolutely not acceptable to the Chinese government and the people&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The unilateral announcement by a country of a 200 nautical mile economic zone is null and void,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>The row over the shoal erupted a few days after Manila protested against an alleged incursion by Chinese naval ships into areas it claims in the Spratly Islands well to the south of the outcrop.</p>
<p>Beijing, which insists all islands in the South China Sea historically belong to China, said the ships were scientific vessels on a research mission.</p>
<p>The Spratlys are also claimed wholly or in part by Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.</p>
