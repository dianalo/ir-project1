<title>UK: LIFFE sees no danger to exchange if Labour wins.</title>

<p>LIFFE chief executive Daniel Hodson said he did not expect any negative changes in terms of regulatory framework or industry-related fiscal measures if the opposition Labour party won the next general election.</p>
<p>Hodson said the exchange had been concerned about retaining a self-regulatory framework and ensuring authorities understood any type of transaction tax could drive business out of Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;We're comfortable that whatever government there is has recognised our contribution and is not planning at any rate to make any changes which are inimical to us,&quot; Hodson told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Hodson said LIFFE had been keen to emphasise to Labour officials that the current regulatory environment, in which LIFFE patrols itself, had operated well.</p>
<p>He said LIFFE, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, had also worked hard to ensure that the ruling Conservatives also understood this.</p>
<p>He said he had not received any &quot;copper bottom&quot; guarantees from Labour that it would not introduce more stringent regulation or fiscal measures, but that in &quot;private conversations&quot; the exchange had been reassured.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have done a lot of work in talking to senior members of the government and to individual MPs (members of parliament) about what we do here and I think there is a much better understanding of where we fit into the financial services industry,&quot; Hodson said.</p>
<p>London's financial markets have enjoyed brisk business and a high degree of self-regulation under the Conservatives, in power since 1979. A general election must be held by May 22.</p>
<p>But LIFFE has been keen to forge warm relations with Labour as well. Labour's economic spokesman, Gordon Brown, used LIFFE as a forum to deliver a key speech on policy last November.  </p>
<p>Hodson said potential deficiencies in its self-regulatory operations, if there were any, had been tightened in the post-Barings era.</p>
<p>&quot;What Barings did do is it made exchanges and regulators focus much more on market risk -- systemic and also the risk associated with the involvement of individual players in the market place.&quot;</p>
<p>He said LIFFE's system of monitoring, where open interest was watched on a daily basis, was effective.</p>
<p>One facet of the Barings scandal involved the buildup of enormous positions by rogue trader Nick Leeson.  </p>
<p>&quot;At LIFFE we do not have a formal large position reporting department per se but we do believe that in terms of the practical effects of what we do at the moment, that we do as good a job as any other exchange which has large positions reporting,&quot; Hodson said.</p>
<p>He said the monitoring the exchange had done had not shown any &quot;life-threatening&quot; instances of large positions which the participants could not explain.</p>
<p>&quot;We always get answers. If we don't then I'd be told and I can't think off hand recently of any situation where I've had to use my authority (to get to the bottom of a position).&quot;</p>
