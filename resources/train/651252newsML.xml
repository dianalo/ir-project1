<p>Drugs company Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn's decision to merge its life science unit with that of British health and technology group Amersham International was seen by analysts on Tuesday as the first step towards tidying up its portfolio.</p>
<p>As leaked in the media in the past 10 days, the U.S./Swedish group announced it would merge its unit Pharmacia Biotech with Amersham Life Science to create a new company, the world's largest research-based biotechnology supplier.</p>
<p>&quot;It obviously is quite a small deal for P&amp;U in terms of figures,&quot; Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst Stephen Putnam told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is more important in terms of sentiment. The company is trying to tidy up its portfolio by making it easier to handle.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure there are other parts of the empire that could be divested...and the most important thing is to see them finally get the dynamics of the business working.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the agreement, P&amp;U will own 45 percent of new company Amersham Pharmacia Biotech with various conditions that will enable P&amp;U to sell out of the new company after January 2000.</p>
<p>Uppsala-based Pharmacia Biotech is larger than Amersham Life Science with 1996 sales worth $439 million compared to Amersham Life sales of 157.1 million stg in the year to March 1996.</p>
<p>However it is believed to be less profitable with much lower profit margins, analysts said.</p>
<p>The move was viewed as positive. Since U.S. Upjohn and Swedish Pharmacia merged in November 1995, the company has struggled, issuing profit warnings three times in the past 12 months and ousting chief executive John Zabriskie.</p>
<p>Analysts saw the divestment of Pharmacia Biotech, a non-core unit, as a positive move towards helping the company concentrate on mainstream drug research.</p>
<p>It follows the float last year of most of medical instruments units Biacore International.</p>
<p>P&amp;U has not earmarked any more of its units for divestment but units that were seen as possible for divestment included diagnostics, part of opthalmology, animal health or the chemical unit.</p>
<p>Analyst Goran Kallebo from Matteus said the move would have little effect on the company overall but it was positive.</p>
<p>At 0945 GMT P&amp;U shares were two crowns higher at 271.</p>
<p>&quot;P&amp;U has been talking about launching Biotech for about a year and with a merger you have a stronger company,&quot; Kallebo told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Although this is not a big deal in relationship to P&amp;U it can be seen as one step of many yet to come. They will divest much more to concentrate the company a lot more.&quot;</p>
<p>Analyst Gustav Rhenman from Ohman also saw the merger as positive although long expected.</p>
<p>&quot;They can concentrate more on the ethical drugs business,&quot; Rhenman said. &quot;It'll give the company more time to focus.</p>
<p>&quot;We could see further divestments but also I think they could reduce the wide range of products on local markets that are not doing very well.&quot;</p>
