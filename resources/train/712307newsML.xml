<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended broadly higher in light trading on Tuesday, bolstered by a combination of speculative and commercial buying on the heels of four consecutive sessions of losses, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a correction against a major sell-off,&quot; said one trader. Since last Monday, New York cocoa prices had tumbled nearly nine percent.</p>
<p>Benchmark September futures rose $20 a tonne on the day, to $1,578, after ranging from $1,588 to $1,545. Spot July also gained $20, to close at $1,556, while the remaining months finished $17 to $20 higher.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices fell at the opening bell, in line with losses on the London market. But trade and industry-related buying stemmed losses and brought September through Monday's close of $1,558 a tonne, triggering commission house buy-stops.</p>
<p>Technically, traders now focused on a chart gap on the upside between Monday's high of $1,590 and $1,610. While the gap will probably be filled, they said September was likely to trade in a sideways range in the near-term between $1,520 and $1,650.</p>
<p>On the fundamental side, port sources in Abidjan put Ivorian arrivals at 1.05-1.06 million tonnes for the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) crop by July 4 compared with around 1.148 million at the same stage in the record 1995/96 season.</p>
<p>The day's volume reached an estimated 5,893 lots.</p>
