<p>Libya said on Wednesday a Libyan plane had flown an official delegation to Ghana's capital Accra despite a 1992 United Nations ban on its international flights.</p>
<p>Libyan state-run television showed footage of a Libyan Arab Airlines plane and the main sign over an arrival hall reading Accra airport with Libyan officials being greeted.</p>
<p>The official Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in Tunis, said an adviser to President Jerry Rawlings and a Ghanaian foreign ministry official greeted the Libyan foreign ministry delegation at the airport.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Libya said it had told the Security Council that it considered itself no longer subject to the air embargo after it gave permission for an American-piloted balloon to overfly its territoruy last week.</p>
<p>The delegation was visiting Ghana on an official visit, the agency said. It did not say when the plane landed in Accra and gave no other details.</p>
<p>Libya has on several occasions violated a ban on international flights which is part of sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 1992 after it refused to hand over two Libyans indicted in the United States and Britain for their alleged role in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 killing 270 people.</p>
<p>JANA said earlier on Wednesday: &quot;(Libya) has informed the Security Council that the Arab Libyan airlines will continue its international flights and (Libya will) open its airspace to aircraft from other states after it permitted U.S. citizen Steve Fossett's balloon to cross the Libyan airspace.&quot;</p>
<p>It said a Libyan diplomat had handed a letter setting out Tripoli's position to the Security Council chairman and asked that it be circulated as an official document of the council.</p>
<p>A U.N. sanctions committee source on Tuesday rejected the Libyan claim, saying it was a &quot;lot of hot air&quot;.</p>
<p>Libya first denied Fossett permission to overfly the country, but later changed its position. According to Fossett's control centre in Chicago, he was over Libya for an hour and 45 minutes though the detour and loss of fuel forced him to cut short his attempted around-the-world flight in India.</p>
<p>Libya has broken the flight ban on several occasions -- it flew Moslem pilgrims to Saudi Arabia in 1995 and 1996 and a Libyan-registered aircraft flew Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to Cairo and back to attend an Arab summit in June 1996.</p>
<p>After the Gaddafi flight the U.N. sanctions committee warned Libya that it would consider recommending tougher curbs if the violations were repeated.</p>
