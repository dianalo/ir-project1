<p>Phillips Petroleum Co has sent a letter of intent to Australia's Northern Territory government to build a A$1.9 billion onshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in the Northern Territory, The Australian Financial Review newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The onshore LNG plant would process gas delivered via a 470 kilometre sub-sea pipeline from the giant Undan-Bayu gas field in the Timor Sea between Northern Australia and Indonesia, the newspaper said. Phillips leads a consortium which owns the Bayu side of the field, while the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd leads a consortium which owns the Undan side of the field.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Northern Territory's (NT) Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment, Mr Mike Reed, and the NT Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Daryl Manzie, have received from Phillips a notice of intent to build the LNG facility at Wickham Point, on Darwin Harbour's Middle Arm,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The project would however need the agreement of BHP Petroleum, which is proposing an offshore LNG project.</p>
<p>The Australian Financial Review said Reed would announce the project in the Northern Territory parliament later on Wednesday and say work on an environmental impact statement would begin soon.  </p>
<p>Petroz NL has a 14.95 percent interest in the ZOCA 91-12 Undan permit held by the consortium led by BHP with 42.42 percent.</p>
<p>Other joint venturers are Santos Ltd with 21.43 percent and Indonesia's Inpex Sahul Ltd with 21.21 percent.</p>
<p>Petroz said in September it had upgraded its estimate of the proved sales gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) contained in the complete Bayu-Undan oil and gas field by 42 percent to 2.4 trillion cubic feet (tcf).  </p>
<p>But it said then it had reduced its estimate of proved plus probable reserves by six percent to 3.1 tcf and had cut the estimate of proved plus probable plus possible reserves to four tcf from a maximum of six tcf.</p>
<p>Petroz also said then that BHP and Phillips were conducting feasibility studies into the development of the fields and a final decision would be taken in the third quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The Phillips-led joint venture owns the ZOCA 91013 Bayu permit.  </p>
<p>Participating in the venture are Phillips as operator with 60 percent; Oryx Energy Co, 25 percent; and Hardy Oil &amp; Gas Plc, 15 percent.</p>
