<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton left Spain on Thursday for Warsaw after a NATO summit in Madrid which invited Poland and two other east European countries to join the alliance.</p>
<p>His visit to Poland will be the first stop of tour to congratulate the successful states invited to join NATO and assure those left out they have not been abandoned.</p>
<p>At a historic summit in Madrid, NATO invited former communist states Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to join the western alliance. Romania, Slovenia and the three Baltic states were excluded from the first wave of enlargement.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Clinton will be feted by crowds delighted their country has joined one of the West's leading clubs, bidding a final farewell to its Soviet-imposed communist past.</p>
<p>Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, the latest attack in a history of domination by powerful neighbours.</p>
<p>Ecstatic Polish commentators have called the invitation to join the Western military alliance one of the most important moments in the last 300 years of its history.</p>
<p>A five-hour event on the Warsaw Old Town's Castle Square on Thursday, featuring jazz and folk music of the two nations, will culminate in a 15-minute address by Clinton. Organisers expect some 20,000 people to attend.</p>
<p>Since emerging from Soviet domination in 1991, the country has yearned to come under the mutual defence commitment of NATO's 1949 founding treaty which places the European allies under the cover of the American nuclear shield.</p>
<p>From Warsaw, Clinton will fly on to Bucharest to explain the NATO decision to Romanians and urge them to continue the reform process that brought them so close on this occasion.</p>
<p>Albright will take the same message to Slovenia and the former Soviet republic of Lithuania.</p>
<p>Albright will also visit St Petersburg to encourage Russia to take full advantage of the possibility of a special pact with NATO, negotiated to run in parallel with enlargement.</p>
