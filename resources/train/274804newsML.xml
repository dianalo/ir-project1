<p>SYDNEY-HOBART RACE RECORD NOT LIKELY TO BE BROKEN THIS YEAR</p>
<p>Organisers of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race say the weather this year may well put the race record beyond the reach of most contenders.</p>
<p>Navigators and skippers have just been given a briefing on what to expect of the 52nd Sydney to Hobart classic.</p>
<p>On Boxing Day, 95 yachts will cross the start line to move down the New South Wales with winds from two weather fronts to fill their sails.</p>
<p>But, the winds aren't likely to deliver enough speed to break any records.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, line honours favourite, the German-owned, Morning Glory, is expected to fit its replacement mast today.</p>
<p>The mast has been flown in overnight from New Zealand.</p>

<p>OVERSEAS TOURISTS FIND DIVING DANGEROUS</p>
<p>A new study has found more overseas tourists were admitted to Queensland's coastal hospitals after scuba diving accidents than for any other activity during the 1993-94 financial year.</p>
<p>The analysis of public hospital figures showed 35 foreign visitors were treated for the bends at Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Proserpine, Rockhampton, Nambour, the Sunshine and Gold Coast hospitals.</p>
<p>One of the study authors, psychologist and law student, Doctor Jeff Wilks says that's six times the number of interstate tourists admitted to hospital with decompression illness in the same period.</p>
<p>He says people come to Australia and like to explore the Barrier Reef and he's appealed to operators to insist they be accompanied by experienced staff.</p>

<p>JOCKEYS' DISPUTE SET TO ESCALATE</p>
<p>A jockeys' wage dispute is likely to escalate into a national strike if the claim by riders is not resolved by tomorrow.</p>
<p>Jockeys are seeking an increase from 65 dollars to 130 dollars per ride, claiming 90 per cent of them earn less than the average weekly wage.</p>
<p>The jockeys warn if there's no resolution by Christmas, the dispute is likely to escalate.</p>
<p>A-J-C Chief Executive, Tony King, says he hopes common sense will prevail, but says it's up to racing clubs in each state to negotiate with their jockey associations.</p>
