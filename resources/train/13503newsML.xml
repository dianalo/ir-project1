<p>The deadly O-157 bacteria outbreak which has killed 11 people in Japan this summer, has also caused a substantial drop in sales of fresh food and other goods thought to be linked to the epidemic.</p>
<p>&quot;The O-157 bacteria is affecting sales greatly, and there are no clear prospects of when this will subside,&quot; a spokesman for the Japan Chain Stores Association said on Monday.</p>
<p>The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic this summer in Japan that has killed 11 people and made more than 9,500 people ill so far.</p>
<p>The nationwide outbreak of food poisoning caused by the O-157 bacteria led to diminishing sales of fresh foods and leisure-related products, the association said.</p>
<p>Department store sales in Japan fell 2.4 percent in July from a year earlier to 898.66 billion yen ($8.32 billion), the Japan Department Stores' Association said. Chain stores also reported a 2.5 percent drop in sales that month to 1.48 trillion yen ($13.7 billion).</p>
<p>The bacillus causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting and fever that often leads to liver complications.</p>
<p>Other reasons cited for a drop in sales were due to one less weekend that month, and a decline in seasonal gift-giving because of a weak economic recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a shift in consumption from one type of food to another to avoid the bacteria, but this is not enough to cover for losses. It is also difficult to regain the trust of consumers when one type of food is put into question by hearsay,&quot; the association spokesman said.</p>
<p>The bacteria outbreak has had a devastating impact on sales of fresh food.</p>
<p>Since the start of the outbreak, raw fish, liver, chicken, noodles and a variety of sweets have all been blamed and then exonerated -- but not before causing sales of the items to plummet.</p>
<p>Radish sprouts also joined the growing list of food items first blamed for causing the epidemic and then cleared of responsibility.</p>
<p>Consumers kept away from fresh vegetables for salads, such as cucumber and lettuce. Watermelon sales, traditionally a very popular fruit during the hot summer season, were down.</p>
<p>Meat sales also slipped as people avoided beef, ham and hamburgers.</p>
<p>Even sales of traditional Japanese raw foods such as sashimi and sushi were sluggish. ($1=108 yen)</p>
