<headline>NCAA BASKETBALL-MINNESOTA, UTAH, UCLA WIN IN OT, KENTUCKY CRUISES.</headline>
<dateline>SAN ANTONIO, Texas 1997-03-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>It will look routine on the seeding chart, but it was anything but as three of Thursday's four NCAA regional semifinal basketball games went into overtime -- and one of the three into double OT.</p>
<p>Top regional seeds Minnesota and Kentucky and second seeds Utah and UCLA all won to move one victory away from the Final Four in Indianapolis.</p>
<p>In the Midwest Region semifinal in San Antonio, Bobby Jackson scored a career-high 36 points, grabbed nine rebounds and hit a series of key shots down the stretch as Minnesota rallied from a six-point deficit in the first overtime for a 90-84 double-overtime victory over fourth-seeded Clemson.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been playing like this all year,&quot; Minnesota coach Clem Haskins said. &quot;This group of young men refuse to die, refuse to quit, and this shows you the character and the courage this group of young players have, along with the veterans, at the University of Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<p>Jackson became the first player in over three years to score more than 30 points for Minnesota, which improved to 8-0 against ranked teams this season.</p>
<p>&quot;I just do whatever Coach asks me, and I go out there and give him my all,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;This team played really great ball, and Clemson, they took us to the max. They're just a great ball club. This is one of the best basketball games I've ever played in. It just feels great to win.&quot;</p>
<p>Sam Jacobson added 29 points for Minnesota (30-3). Greg Buckner led Clemson (23-10) with 22 points before fouling out</p>
<p>The Golden Gophers, who won their first two contests by an average of 25.5 points, will face UCLA in the regional finals on Saturday.</p>
<p>Cameron Dollar's driving layup with 1.9 seconds to go in overtime lifted UCLA past sixth-seeded Iowa State, 74-73.</p>
<p>Kenny Pratt missed a free throw with 14 seconds remaining and UCLA's Kris Johnson grabbed the rebound but was whistled for travelling. Jacy Holloway inbounded the ball for Iowa State (22-9) and lofted a high pass to Shawn Bankhead, who dunked the ball for a 73-72 advantage.</p>
<p>Dollar took the inbounds pass and drove the length of the court before lofting a high, arching shot over Jacy Holloway and off the glass for the winning basket.</p>
<p>Iowa State called time out but was unable to inbound the ball, forcing a turnover.</p>
<p>Dollar finished with a career-high 20 points. &quot;Before the play, coach had already given me the go-ahead to break it down and go to the rack, so I was already in that frame of mind,&quot; Dollar said.</p>
<p>&quot;I got the ball and I was able to get around him. Whenever you see a big man, you never shy away, you go right at him.  I tried to go up on him. If he blocks it, we go home. If I make it, we win.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We came out in the second half and fought our fannies off,&quot; UCLA first-year coach Steve Lavin said. &quot;All year we've had to deal with controversy.  We just keep finding ways to overcome adversity.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bruins (24-7), the national champions two years ago, are in the regional finals for the third time in six years.</p>
<p>Dedric Willoughby had 34 points, including eight three-pointers, for the Cyclones.</p>
<p>At the NCAA West Region semifinal in San Jose, California, second-seeded Utah blew a 14-point halftime lead but recovered for an 82-77 victory over sixth-seeded Stanford. Michael Doleac scored eight of his 16 points in overtime for Utah.</p>
<p>Keith Van Horn scored 25 points before fouling out for Utah (29-3).</p>
<p>The Utes are in the regional finals for the first time since 1966, when they advanced to the Final Four.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like this was a terrific game and it's a shame someone had to lose it,&quot; said Utah coach Rick Majerus. &quot;I'm very proud of my players. They played with heart. They played with composure. They hit some key foul shots down the stretch. I thought that was an unbelievable win.&quot;</p>
<p>Brevin Knight scored 27 points for Stanford (22-8), which erased a six-point deficit in the final 40 seconds of regulation. Knight forced overtime when he hit a leaning three-pointer from the left corner with 7.1 seconds to play.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a tough loss,&quot; said Knight.</p>
<p>&quot;We gave it everything we had, but we came up short.&quot;</p>
<p>Van Horn was whistled for his fifth foul 34 seconds into overtime when he was called for a moving pick on Knight, who made the first of two free throws to give Stanford its only lead of the game at 68-67.</p>
<p>&quot;I told them, I said, 'Look, you've won without me before. You can win without me now,'&quot; said Van Horn when asked what he told his teammates after he picked up his fifth foul. &quot;I had total confidence in them.&quot;</p>
<p>Utah will face defending champion Kentucky Saturday.</p>
<p>Ron Mercer and Cameron Mills scored 19 points apiece as Kentucky past fourth-seeded St. Joseph's, 83-68.</p>
<p>Kentucky (33-4) has won nine straight NCAA Tournament games since a 74-61 loss to North Carolina in the 1995 East Region final. Rashid Bey scored 26 points to lead St. Joseph's (26-7).</p>
