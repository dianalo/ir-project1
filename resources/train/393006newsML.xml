<headline>INSTANT VIEW - GERMAN JAN M3 GROWTH.</headline>

<p>The following are comments from economists made on Reuters Financial Television on German M3 which grew an annualised 11.7 percent in January versus Q4 96.</p>
<p>Guenter Redeker, Chase Investment in London: &quot;We had been expecting a figure on the high side but this is still a little surprising. The overhang explains some of it. You have a lot of special effects coming into that number. Because of the bulk of one-time effects we should not overestimate this number. I wouldn't be surprised if we have a bad day in the bond market.</p>
<p>Ulrich Beckmann, Deutsche Bank Research: &quot;11.7 percent is a little bit higher than we expected. I don't think it will affect Bundesbank policy and there is still a good chance the full-year figure will come in within the corridor.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;I would think the Bundesbank will keep rates steady for a year or even longer. We need to look more closely at what is happening in the M3 number. Over the last year it has always been special savings schemes that were behind the strong M3 growth and that is really part of capital formation rather than growth in money stock, which might cause inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore I think the Bundesbank will view this figure in a relaxed manner.&quot;</p>
<p>ECKHARD SCHULTE, ECONOMIST, INDUSTRIAL BANK OF JAPAN, &quot;The statistical overhang does not explain the figure overall. Other elements were that lending was strong and capital formation weak.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We saw that cash in circulation has already come down, and we are looking for a lower figure in February. A rate cut is only on the cards if the DM strengthens again, if growth doesn't pick up in the second quarter and if M3 does get back into the corridor by March.</p>
<p>&quot;The long-term outlook on yields is still very positive. We are sticking to our forecast that long term yields will fall to 4 1/4 percent.&quot; Gerhard Grebe, chief economist, Bank Julius Baer: &quot;This is very surprising and shows very strong growth. I don't have exact figures yet, but it looks like the money supply has tripled from around 11 billion in November to around 30 billion, which is clearly higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Among other factors, there seems to be money circulating from the Deutsche Telekom IPO. There is no reason here for the Bundesbank to raise rates. We can remain calm, and three percent will accompany us for a long time.&quot;</p>
