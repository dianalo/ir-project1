<p>Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier Plc  reported an 11 percent rise in 1996 profit on Wednesday but warned that currencies could depress this year's earnings.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier co-chairman Nigel Stapleton told Reuters the strength of sterling would, if maintained, &quot;drag down&quot; headline earnings by five percent this year. Earnings figures for the combined businesses of Reed Elsevier are expressed in sterling.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profits rose to 805 million pounds ($1.3 billion) from 723 million on turnover from continuing operations up to 3.38 billion pounds from 3.21 billion. Analysts had forecast profits of between 808 and 821 million pounds.</p>
<p>Reed International Plc, the British arm of the business, proposed a two-for-one share split to take effect in May.</p>
<p>London-listed Reed shares were down 23.5 pence to 1,150.5p at 1145 GMT, while Elsevier NV shares in Amsterdam dipped 1.70 guilders to 30.80.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company's performance had fallen slightly short of expectations and that Reed shares had risen more than 10 percent over the last two months on bid speculation.</p>
<p>For shareholders in Reed the full-year dividend was raised by 11 percent to 27.2 pence per share. Elsevier shareholders will receive 0.76 guilders per share, a 29 percent increase.</p>
<p>The company noted that currency conversions meant that Elsevier results and dividends were helped in guilder terms.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good news for Elsevier and bad for Reed,&quot; said co-chairman Stapleton. &quot;(But) the two share prices are linked so much that Elsevier should pull Reed up with it in some respects.&quot;</p>
<p>Stapleton said the 1996 figures reflected a &quot;solid performance&quot; right across the group. They followed a four percent earnings dilution resulting from the company's 1995 consumer business divestment programme.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier sold consumer businesses, such as local newspapers, in order to focus on the provision of information in fields like science, business and the legal profession.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier said it remained committed to an active acquisitions policy. He noted the company had spent over 300 million pounds on some 20 transactions in 1996.</p>
<p>Stapleton said a &quot;big deal&quot; such as Reed's $1.5 billion purchase of U.S. on-line information supplier LEXIS-NEXIS in 1994 would be &quot;nice but not necessary&quot;.</p>
<p>Reed said its proposed share split would be put to the vote at its annual general meeting in April, to take effect the following month.</p>
<p>It gave no reason for the split, but companies often opt to split their stock in the belief that the process makes their shares more liquid or tradeable. ($ = 0.629 British Pounds)</p>
