<p>Yen-based platinum group metal (PGMs) futures reversed sharp downward corrections of the past two days to end sharply higher on Friday on animated short-covering by private investors, traders said.</p>
<p>Most palladium futures ended up by their 48 yen per gram daily limits and some months of platinum had jumped by their 75 yen per gram limit by the close.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the arrival of August PGM shipments from Russia, private investors facing losses were forced to cover their short positions, especially in palladium,&quot; a trader at a trading house said.  </p>
<p>Gold futures also ended higher after lacklustre trade following sharp gains in PGM futures.</p>
<p>In gold futures, most private investors were sidelined.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold futures were purely lifted by PGM gains. Sentiment in gold is basically bearish,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from seven yen to 13 yen per gram higher, with benchmark June ending up 12 yen at 1,213 yen.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted at $321.85/322.25 per ounce at 0735 GMT, against $321.70/322.20 in New York on Thursday.</p>
<p>Benchmark June silver was up 0.3 yen at 169.0 yen.</p>
