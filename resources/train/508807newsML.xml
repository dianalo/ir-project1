<p>Trading rose on the Nigerian bourse on Tuesday as more brokers shook off their unease with a newly-installed computerised clearing system, dealers said.</p>
<p>The all-share index, however, fell a touch to 8778.39 from 8778.40 on Monday, the first day of operating the new system.</p>
<p>Dealers said more houses participated in trading compared with the only three that were able to conduct business the day before.</p>
<p>&quot;More dealers lodged their share certificates yesterday and so were able to trade today,&quot; one said, adding &quot;Many people are still trying to see how the system works before resuming business fully.&quot;</p>
<p>Prices rose in general although movement was mainly restricted to blue chip stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>Food/beverages companies dominated the trend, led by Coco-Cola bottler Nigerian Bottling Company which gained one naira to 56.00 naira.</p>
<p>Nestle remained the sector's dearest stock, advancing 10 kobo to 70.15 naira. Cadbury also rose 20 kobo to 40.00 naira, all on increased demand.</p>
<p>Leading conglomerates also finished firmer. Lever Brothers and PZ Industries each gained 50 kobo to 29.10 naira and 29.50 naira, respectively.</p>
<p>UAC continued to be investors' favourite, closing 30 kobo higher at 19.80 naira.</p>
<p>Not much action was recorded in the banks although UBA garnered 20 kobo to end at 15.30 naira.</p>
<p>Troubled Berger Paints recovered on Tuesday, advancing 15 kobo to 3.90 naira.</p>
<p>Agricultural company Ellah Lakes which returned to profit saw its price adjusted to its quotation price of 50 kobo from 10 kobo.</p>
