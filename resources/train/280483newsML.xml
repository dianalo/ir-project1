<p>China's Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli said on Monday the state would have to tighten its belt for a long time to curb rapidly rising expenditure.</p>
<p>Growth in state revenue had averaged more than 90 billion yuan ($10.8 billion) a year from 1993 to 1996, but that was not enough to cover rising expenditure, state radio quoted Liu as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;We must tighten our belts, and moreover, we must tighten our belts for a very long time,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>In 1997, Beijing should set up an apparatus for budgetary control and rein in the rapid growth of spending, Liu said.</p>
<p>China should &quot;bring the fine traditions of practising economy and opposing waste into financial management,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>Liu did not elaborate on what this would entail but said China should ensure fiscal support for agriculture, education, science and technology and government organs.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Liu said China had reported a basically balanced budget for 1996, with the state deficit held within the targeted range.</p>
<p>State revenue increased by 18.1 percent in the first 11 months, official reports have said.</p>
<p>The finance ministry has forecast a budget deficit of 60 billion yuan in 1997, with financial revenue seen increasing by 13-15 percent.</p>
