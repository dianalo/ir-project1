<p>The boom in the broadcasting of sports events on pay TV need not stop European sports fans watching major events live without having to pay, sports broadcasting representatives said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Pay TV can be developed without necessarily having exclusive rights to events,&quot; Jean-Bernard Muench, secretary- general of the European Broadcasting Union, told a European Parliament hearing on public access to televised sports events.</p>
<p>The hearing comes as the parliament and the European Commission prepare to find a way, through changes to the EU's TV without frontiers directive, to allow national governments to guarantee viewers free access to coverage of events like the Olympic Games and the World Cup soccer finals.</p>
<p>Pay TV operators who won exclusive rights to broadcast those events would have to ensure they were offered unscrambled or on a non-subscription channel.</p>
<p>Muench, whose EBU represents public broadcasters, agreed with Vic Wakeling, the sports director of the commercial satellite broadcaster BSkyB, that the development of pay TV meant dedicated fans could watch a string of events which would never get an airing on free terrestrial TV.</p>
<p>But he had a warning for sports federations seeking to finance their sport by selling the exclusive broadcasting rights to major events like the Wimbledon tennis tournament to pay TV.</p>
<p>If the general public had to pay for the privilege of watching major events, the audience would drop, the sport would decline in popularity, and this would eventually undermine it, Muench said.</p>
<p>BSkyB's Wakeling defended the rights of sports clubs to sell their rights to whoever they liked, without interference from outsiders, though he insisted BSkyB was not opposed to countries drawing up lists of events which must be free.</p>
<p>&quot;(The clubs) should have the freedom to dispose of their legitimate rights as they, the owners, see fit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Commission has proposed a system, generally supported by the EBU, which allows countries to draw up lists of events that are of &quot;major importance for society&quot; and must be shown free.</p>
<p>These lists must be recognised by broadcasters from other EU countries.</p>
<p>The Commission would decide whether to approve the list after consulting a committee of national experts.</p>
