<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's leading share index climbed one percent as investors welcomed a sharp rally on Wall Street and poured into banking, oil and retail stocks. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,927.3, up 50.7 points, or 1.04 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's IBIS DAX index ended the day at a record closing high, with sentiment during share dealings boosted by early advances on Wall Street and the ongoing strength of the dollar. The DAX-30 index closed at 4,421.72, up 40.03 points, or 0.91 percent. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,458.66, up 80.96 points, or 1.85 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - Shares rose sharply and established a fresh closing high but ended below an all-time intra-day high reached earlier in the day. The CAC-40 index closed at 3,069.30, up 45.67 points, or 1.51 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares closed near the day's highs, drawing strength from a three percent jump in index heavyweight Novartis, which climbed 76 Swiss francs at 2,428 francs. The Swiss market index closed at 5,929.5, up 87.4 points, or 1.50 percent.</p>
<p>MILAN - Shares ended firmer reversing yesterday's sharp losses taking their lead from the surge in the Dow Jones in early trading, firmer European bourses and the steady recovery in domestic bonds. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 14,805, up 168 points, or 1.15 percent.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Shares closed mixed after a volatile session which saw early gains give way to a spasm of retail profit-taking before the return of buyers during the afternoon. The AEX index closed at 975.31, up 0.35 points, or 0.04 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks ended trade lower, discouraged by worries that more big brokerages could be involved in a payoff scandal ensnaring Nomura Securities Co Ltd. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 20,212.82, down 189.92 points, or 0.93 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - The Hang Seng Index swept through 16,000 points for the first time and set a record closing high as property stocks returned to favour after spending most of the post-handover period in the doldrums. The Hang Seng index closed at 15,983.18, up 211.12 points, or 1.34 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Shares faded to finish little changed after a cut in interest rates proved to be an anti-climax with the market widely anticipating the Reserve Bank's actions. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,735.0, up 3.1 points, or 0.11 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Industrial shares finished higher helped by Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals' comments that he was hopeful interest rates would be cut before year-end. The All-share index closed at 7,473.7, down 0.1 points, or 0.00 percent. The All Gold index closed at 982.6, down 4.2 points, or 0.19 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 9,122.4, up 17.1 points, or 0.43 percent.</p>
