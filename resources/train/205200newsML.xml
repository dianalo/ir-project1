<p>Japan's Finance Ministry will submit the draft of the revised Foreign Exchange Control Act to the next normal session of parliament, Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto recently announced a plan to deregulate Japan's financial markets by 2001 in a five-year program that has been called &quot;Tokyo's Big Bang&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I will spearhead this move by submitting the draft of the revision of the Foreign Exchange Control Act, which would completely deregulate foreign exchange transactions in Tokyo in the next normal session of the Diet,&quot; Sakakibara said during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>That would be followed by deregulation of securities transactions and other necessary legal measures, including accounting and taxes, he said.</p>
<p>Sakakibara said that while there was some justifiable scepticism about the &quot;big bang&quot; feasibility, the prime minister and finance minister had staked the survival of the government on its success.</p>
<p>The Finance Minstry itself was well known for its gradualist approach but, in this case, it was determined to go through with &quot;shock therapy&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Responding to scepticism that change over a period of several years could hardly be described as shock therapy, Sakakibara said 2001 was not that far away. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6441</p>
