<p>The Indonesian government will vet speeches given by political parties over television and radio in the campaign leading to May 29 general elections, an election commission spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A team which includes officials from the Home Affairs and Information Ministries will screen the speeches before they are broadcast by the TVRI television network and the RRI radio station,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The speeches should not attack the government and they should merely contain the programmes of the respective political parties, he said.</p>
<p>Political speeches originate on state television and radio and are only relayed by private channels.</p>
<p>The commission spokesman said the order was sent on Tuesday to the three parties legally permitted to contest the national and local elections, the ruling Golkar, the Moslem-based United Development Party (PPP) and the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).</p>
<p>The broadcast regulation is the latest in a series of restrictions for the election campaign which runs from April 27 to May 23, followed by a cooling off period before the polls are held.</p>
