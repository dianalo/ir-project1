<headline>Dollar steady at firmer levels in quiet Europe.</headline>

<p>The dollar firmed slightly against the mark in afternoon Europe, buoyed by a slip in the mark against the franc and lira after earlier highs seen following French elections Sunday.</p>
<p>A holiday in Britain and the U.S. kept activity to a minimum and confined the dollar to fairly tight ranges. By afternoon trade the dollar stood at 1.6890/95 marks after touching a session high of 1.6909 and down from late Friday's 1.6925/30.</p>
<p>The mark was higher in early Europe against the franc and lira after France's left-wing parties' posted a surprise lead over the ruling centre-right in Sunday's first-round vote.</p>
<p>But the mark retreated slightly as the prospect of a Socialist-coalition French government raised the chances of a broad-based start for Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU), seen as a dilution of the euro's strength.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is surprised at the French vote but what we saw was more of knee-jerk reaction in a thin market,&quot; said a dealer at a Brussels-based bank. &quot;The perception is that EMU will go ahead no matter who is in charge of France.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar also gained against the yen, moving above 116 yen and eyeing a test of chart resistance around the 116.40 yen area, last week's high and recent range top.</p>
<p>By 1330 GMT, dollar/yen was trading at 116.23/33 against 115.63/73 late Friday in Europe.</p>
<p>This week sees has little in the way of key economic data but market attention will be on Wednesday's U.S. durable goods orders for April while Thursday has Japanese April industrial production.</p>
<p>Friday is a big day for Japanese data with April/May CPI and April retail sales the major releases.</p>
