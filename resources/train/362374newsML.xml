<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-07</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures mostly ended lower Friday in a moderate session, pressured the entire day by reports of crumbling cash prices and a flood of technical selling after an early break of support.</p>
<p>March tumbled 17.9 cents to close at $2.182 per million British thermal units. April settled 8.6 cents lower at $2.092. Others ended mixed, with some 1999s again up slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals are bearish, and technically, we broke some key support. I think we could see (March) prices in the $1.90s soon,&quot; said one East Coast trader, adding he expected the &quot;carnage&quot; to continue on Monday.  </p>
<p>The National Weather Service 6-10 day forecast released Friday expects the eastern half of the nation to range from normal to above-normal, while the West dips below-normal.</p>
<p>With little exteme weather on the horizon and the eastern stock surplus likely to grow more in next week's AGA data, few expected cash or futures to rally much near-term. Most agreed pressure on eastern utilities to trim bloated stocks will mount as winter draws to a close in the next six weeks.</p>
<p>Technical traders said March's close Friday below trendline support should mean a test of the Nov 5 low of $2.12. March resistance was seen in the low-$2.50s and then in the $2.70 and $2.80 area.</p>
<p>In the cash, weekend Gulf Coast prices skidded 10-15 cents Friday to the mid-$2.30s. Midcon pipes were off about a nickel to the $2.30-35 area. New York city gate gas was quoted more than 10 cents lower at about $2.90.</p>
<p>The 12-month Henry Hub strip fell five cents to $2.147. NYMEX said an estimated 33,830 Hub contracts traded, up from Thursday's revised tally of 21,794.</p>
<p>NYMEX Alberta and Permian natgas did not trade Friday.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, March finished 12.9 cents lower at $1.97, while deferreds ended down by two to 6.3 cents. The East/West spread narrowed by five cents to 21.2 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
