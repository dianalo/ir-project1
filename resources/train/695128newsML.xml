<p>The Sri Lankan navy sank four Tamil Tiger guerrilla boats when it intercepted rebel flotillas off the east coast of this Indian Ocean island, a naval spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>He said at least 40 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were believed killed in three separate attacks on separatist boats late on Saturday near Trincomalee, which lies some 260 km (162 miles) east of the capital Colombo.</p>
<p>&quot;There were in all seven boats involved in the incidents. Four were destroyed, two were damaged while one managed to escape,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;At least 40 LTTE are believed to have been killed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the boats were carrying arms and food supplies to the rebel's northern Wanni stronghold, currently under assault by government forces, when they were challenged by navy ships near Pulmoddai and Kokkilai on the eastern coast.</p>
<p>The LTTE's spokesman in London was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The navy sank seven rebel boats last month, when it intercepted another rebel flotilla also believed to be carrying reinforcements. Military officials at the time said up to 50 LTTE rebels were killed in the battle off Kokkilai, 260 km (160 miles) northeast of Colombo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Defence Ministry statement said on Sunday that five rebels were killed in a battle with a military patrol near the northeastern town of Nedunkeni, which was captured last month by troops as part of Operation &quot;Jaya Sikuru&quot; or &quot;Sure of Victory&quot;.</p>
<p>The offensive into the rebels' stronghold in the Wanni region began in May.</p>
<p>The independent Island newspaper said on Saturday that the Sri Lankan army had halted its advance into the northern brush jungles of the Wanni after suffering heavy losses in two counterattacks by separatists.</p>
<p>It said the army, which has suffered almost 300 troop deaths at the hands of the rebels this month, has temporarily called off the operation aimed at opening a crucial northern highway linking the government-held town of Vavuniya to the Jaffna peninsula.</p>
<p>Vavuniya is some 220 km (135 miles) north of Colombo while Jaffna is some 100 km (60 miles) farther north.</p>
<p>But a Defence Ministry spokesman denied the advance had been halted. &quot;Troops are consolidating. They are dominating ahead of their defences. But the offensive has not been stalled.</p>
<p>&quot;When the time is right for them to move again, they will advance,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>State radio quoted Deputy Defence Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte as saying on Sunday that the troops would continue to flush out the rebels in the northern region.</p>
<p>The radio quoted Ratwatte as saying that though the rebels were mounting sporadic attacks on the troops he was confident the army will take control of the strategic highway.</p>
<p>The LTTE, who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east, attacked the armed forces twice within two weeks, causing heavy losses to both sides.</p>
<p>Independent confirmation of incidents is not possible as journalists are not allowed in the war zone.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE say the toll is higher.</p>
