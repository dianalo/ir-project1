<p>Poland had a current account deficit of $1.35 billion in 1996 but the zloty held ground within its trading band as the gap was offset by foreign capital inflows, analysts said.</p>
<p>They said that foreign direct and portfolio investment and borrowing allowed currency reserves to rise and the zloty to stay firm.</p>
<p>The net reserves, those in the entire banking system, rose $1.37 billion to $21.81 billion and official currency reserves rose $3.07 billion to $18.03 billion despite the current account gap.</p>
<p>Analysts said the balance between the widening current account gap and foreign capital inflows would likely determine the zloty's performance this year, with many expecting it to stay relatively stable in real terms.</p>
<p>&quot;If budget assumptions for exports and imports growth in 1997 are met and foreign capital inflows are as big as expected, reserves could stay flat and there will be no upward or downward pressure on the zloty,&quot; said Tadeusz Chroscicki, chief analyst at the government's Centre for Strategic Studies (CSS).</p>
<p>Analysts said the zloty, measured against Polish producer price inflation in 1996 and weighed with a basket of currencies from Poland's main trade partners, was virtually flat in 1996.</p>
<p>The zloty, floated in a 14-percent range around the central parity rate, which is now devalued by one percent per month against a basket of five currencies, remained some two to three percent stronger than parity for most of 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, the 31.9 percent growth of imports and only 6.7 percent rise of exports in 1996 made this year's budget assumptions of 15 percent export growth and 21 percent import growth an ambitious target.</p>
<p>According to the National Bank of Poland the trade gap last year surged to $8.15 billion from $1.83 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Analysts said the trade deficit could rise to $12 billion in 1997 even if the expected economic recovery in Germany, Poland's main trade partner, helps boost exports.</p>
<p>But they said that as long as imports were dominated by investment and not consumer goods, the trade gap was not very worrying for a country which required major retooling to catch up with developed nations in terms of technology.</p>
<p>&quot;The deficit at current levels (for a fast developing economy) is not very worrying, because it clearly forces down domestic prices and increases effectiveness,&quot; said Bohdan Wyznikiewicz, deputy head of the independent Gdansk think-tank.</p>
<p>Analysts expected an additional export boost from foreign direct investment and portfolio investment, which would not only increase the quantity but also the quality of Polish exports.</p>
<p>&quot;Some analyses show that for every $100 of FDI $40 go towards imports of technology and equipment and that every invested dollar will eventually produce $2 worth of exports,&quot; an analyst at a foreign financial institution said.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign capital inflows are likely to increase as Poland comes closer to starting negotiations on European Union and NATO membership, so I would expect they would fully offset the negative current account,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Analysts said unclassified trade flows, which account for Poland's huge cross-border shopping revenues, would likely remain flat this year with a slight downward trend possible as the country's economy becomes more transparent in line with Warsaw's drive to European Union membership.</p>
<p>According to NBP date such flows eased $600 million to $7.15 billion last year.</p>
