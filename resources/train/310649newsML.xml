<p>French shares pushed higher on Wednesday as the market took heart from the overnight advance on Wall Street and bonds, traders said.</p>
<p>The market surged 0.58 percent at the opening, smashing initial resistance at 2,411 on the CAC index but then retraced to hover just below that level.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 8.58 points or 0.36 percent at 2,410.72 at 0917 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was up eight at 2,414 from 2,406 on Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was 820 million francs.</p>
<p>Media and advertising group Havas rises one percent to 397 francs, as market curiosity mounts over yesterday's suspension of specialist press publisher CEP Communications, 73-percent held by Havas. Speculation centres on a Havas buy out of minority shareholders.</p>
<p>Lagardere gains 3.24 percent to 149.70 francs. Chairman of electronics firm Cie des Signaux told the Figaro yesterday he thought Lagardere's Matra had the industrial and financial credentials to win Thomson-CSF, prompting speculation Cie des Signaux could link up with Thomson-CSF and its new operator.</p>
<p>Valeo rises 3.33 percent to 372 francs, helped by talk that it has won a big contract from General Motors, as well as continued speculation it could replace UAP on the CAC.</p>
<p>Schneider advances 1.16 percent to 261.30 francs. Broker Leven held a breakfast meeting with the company this morning and is putting out a buy recommendation, market sources said.</p>
<p>LVMH adds 1.97 percent to 1,498 francs after closure of DFS acquisition. Ferri had a buy recommendation at 1,480 francs.</p>
<p>Cie Bancaire still firm. The stock has risen strongly recently on the back of merger speculation in the financial sector.</p>
