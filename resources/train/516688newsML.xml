<headline>Med oil products soften, look to Asia for support.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-17</dateline>

<p>Mediterranean oil products were softer on Thursday in an unhurried market, with Asian sellng chances the only major factor, traders said.</p>
<p>Naphtha was easier but found some support in buying interest for arbitrage to the Far East.</p>
<p>&quot;The arbitrage may be possible and makes a better alternative when weighed against European demand, but it's not as good as it was last month,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Outright prices were notionally assessed around $1-2 lower at $176/$179 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Gasoline was supported at the lower levels by buying into Italy, the East Med and the Black Sea.</p>
<p>However buying was fairly relaxed and there was plenty of product in Italy to cover local needs. Premium unleaded cargoes for balance of April delivery talked around fob high quotes +$2 a tonne, equivalent to around $197 fob Med.</p>
<p>Gas oil premiums held firm on the back of continued Asian interest which was keeping Italian 0.2 pct around fob high quotes +$3-5.</p>
<p>Sought after Russian &quot;arb&quot; cargoes were looking for high fob quotes +$4. A large cargo available out of the Black Sea on 25-30 dates was likely to be sold on Friday or early next week.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil suffered from poor demand and ample supply, with traders weighing the profitability of taking material east.</p>
<p>A German trader was heard to have bought 50kt of end-April Italian barrels, for high quotes plus 25 cents or $1, possibly to take to Asia. But notional values held at around $88/$89 fob.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers are still the same but the next deal you'll see will be significantly lower,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Low sulphur was talked slightly weaker with no business seen.</p>
