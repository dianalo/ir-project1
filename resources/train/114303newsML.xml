<p>Jordan's King Hussein will travel to the West Bank on Tuesday with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat for his first visit to the region in 29 years, a senior PLO official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;King Hussein is returning to Jericho with Arafat where they will hold a meeting on Tuesday,&quot; the PLO official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hussein has not visited the West Bank since Israel seized the territory from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>An Arafat aide said the Palestinian president had instructed PLO negotiators to travel to Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba on Tuesday for U.S.-brokered Israel-Palestinian peace talks, but it was not immediately clear whether the Israeli team would meet them there.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian delegation, headed by Dr. Saeb Erekat, has received urgent instructions from President Arafat to travel tonight to Taba,&quot; Arafat adviser Khaled Salam told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;These instructions are in line with Palestinian commitments to the agreement with the Israeli and American sides that talks would start on Tuesday,&quot; Salam said.</p>
<p>The formal Taba talks were to have resumed on Monday but were pushed back to allow the sides to progress in informal negotiation channels.</p>
<p>A senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who asked not to be named, could not immediately confirm whether the Israeli team would travel to Egypt.</p>
<p>Palestinian chief negotiator Erekat was meeting his Israeli counterpart Lieutenant-General Dan Shomron in informal talks at a Jerusalem hotel on Monday night. When asked whether the talks had acheived progress, Erekat said: &quot;No&quot;.</p>
<p>Erekat told Israel Channel One television Netanyahu was insisting on renegotiating a signed accord on a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron, reached with Israel's previous government.</p>
<p>But Shomron said progress had been achieved. &quot;There is progress and a narrowing of positions all the time,&quot; he told the television.</p>
<p>A Palestinian spokesman in Amman, where King Hussein and Arafat were meeting, said U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross would meet Arafat in the Jordanian capital later on Monday night to help in breaking the impasse.</p>
<p>&quot;President Arafat had accepted to delay talks for only 24 hours. Until now we have no response from the Israelis. Shomron had no clear answers on the date and venue of the talks,&quot; Salam said of the Taba negotiations.</p>
<p>A PLO official had earlier reported the talks were off.</p>
<p>Arafat met King Hussein to brief him on talks over Israel's long-delayed redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>King Hussein called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a break in his talks with Arafat, Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said without giving details.</p>
