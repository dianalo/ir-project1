<p>ING Barings said its saw further confirmation of the bullish</p>
<p>chart picture, while money flow indicators signalled buyers</p>
<p>coming back to the market.</p>
<p>Mees Pierson and JAAD both said technical indicators were</p>
<p>improving, while ABN AMRO noted that the index had finally</p>
<p>broken the resistance level at around 740 and advised investors</p>
<p>to increase their long positions.</p>
<p>The AEX share index closed at 741.79 points last Friday,</p>
<p>17.41 points up from the previous week's close.</p>

<p>Note - Contributors' own analysis follows.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO - Amsterdam has finally broken the resistance level</p>
<p>around 740, after testing it twice. today we saw a test of these</p>
<p>levels during opening hours, which decreased the downward</p>
<p>potential on the short time frame considerably. So we advise to</p>
<p>increase you LONG positions at current levels for a ride with</p>
<p>the Bulls towards the previous tops at 780. Intermediate</p>
<p>resistance levels are present around 745 and 755, however, they</p>
<p>are of little significance.</p>
<p>A broad range of individual stocks show a comparable</p>
<p>outlook, which supports our view.</p>
<p>Additionally, related interest rate futures and important</p>
<p>currencies are still supporting the upward scenario. In short,</p>
<p>strong upward potential is still present at current levels.</p>
<p>Consequently our short term indicators have bottomed out as</p>
<p>higher prices are being set.</p>
<p>ING BARINGS - The AEX is slowly completing large base</p>
<p>formation on the upside. The bullish picture on the charts of</p>
<p>the AEX has been confirmed by a golden cross of the two</p>
<p>short-term moving averages, with both averages on an upward</p>
<p>slope. Intermediate objectives come in around 770, then at</p>
<p>crucial resistance at 780.</p>
<p>A solid break above 780 is required to have the long-term</p>
<p>uptrend resumed. Money flow of the AEX is slowly picking up</p>
<p>again, confirming buying power in the market. It also indicates</p>
<p>improving technicals. Money flow indicators signal buyers</p>
<p>rushing back into the market.</p>
<p>The A/D ratio remains a bit subdued, signalling lack of</p>
<p>leadership. All in all we conclude that the underlying</p>
<p>technicals have further improved over the past few days.</p>
<p>The medium term patterns of the AEX, as well as the short</p>
<p>term trend, both showing rising slopes, are bullish.</p>
<p>JAAD - Most indicators have turned Positive so the programme</p>
<p>has given a buying signal. It could well be that the market has</p>
<p>reached its turning point.</p>
<p>RABO SECURITIES - For the third week in succession we have</p>
<p>to report that the trading range is still intact. Last Friday</p>
<p>the AEX once again tested resistance at 745 and bounced back.</p>
<p>Technical indicators are confirming this neutral picture.</p>
<p>However, a clear break on either side of this trading range</p>
<p>would fuel a new rally. We expect the market to remain volatile</p>
<p>for the coming weeks but we do not think that support at 698</p>
<p>will give way easily.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the resistance at 745 is tested once</p>
<p>more, this barrier is getting stronger and a possible break of</p>
<p>this level will be more significant.</p>
<p>MEES PIERSON - The short-term technical indicators are</p>
<p>improving. The cue may come again from Wall Street this week</p>
<p>which last week rose a hefty 300 points but is still in a</p>
<p>downtrend in the upper side of the trend, testing resistance.</p>
<p>The market stays capped in a trading range between roughly</p>
<p>698 and 742. We still think the risks are on the downside here</p>
<p>the market could reach the level of 680 or 660.</p>
<p>Therefore we first need to see a break from the support at</p>
<p>698. If the market is going to break the 742 level we can expect</p>
<p>a very fast test of the old top at 779.</p>
<p>The long-term uptrend is still intact.</p>
