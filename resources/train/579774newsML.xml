<p>INDIA, PAKISTAN OPEN NEW ROUTES FOR BETTER TIES</p>
<p>The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers dared to break the ice after nearly a half decade's freeze on relations. However, no side was willing to openly call it a breakthrough. There were several significant agreements, including one on setting up of joint working groups to handle all outstanding issues including Kashmir, a hotline between the two prime ministers, exchange of civilian prisoners, a proposed agreement on visa, travel and people-to-people contact, diplomatic code of conduct to be strictly observed and both countries to end hostile propaganda.</p>

<p>CHANGES IN SUGAR INDUSTRY LAWS ON ANVIL</p>
<p>The government is considering changing the laws governing the sugar industry. While sugar has already been decanalised, its decontrol is still being opposed. The food ministry was dissatisfied with the way the industry responded to the partial delicensing attempts earlier. None of the 93 licences issued for setting up sugar mills was utilised. The parliamentary standing committee on food had advised the government to fix a floor price for export to avoid price undercutting.</p>

<p>MITSUBISHI ACQUIRES STAKE IN MAHINDRA &amp; MAHINDRA</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Corporation has acquired a one percent stake in jeep and tractor maker Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (M&amp;M). The investment has a five-year lock in. Mitsubishi's move came soon after Peugeot disinvested around three percent stake in M&amp;M. The Mahindra family, along with Kotak Mahindra Finance, picked up the remaining two percent. M&amp;M had been Mitsubishi's sole agent in India for its steel business. Mitsubishi's decision was significant against its plans to enter India, especially in areas like infrastructure and steel.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>HFCL-LED PAGING CONSORTIUM TO SHED MAJORITY STAKE</p>
<p>Microwave Communications (MCL), a paging services consortium led by Himachal Futuristic Communications, agreed to sell majority shares to PortaCom Wireless of the U.S. As per the agreement PortaCom would hold a 65 percent stake in MCL. Shinawatra, which holds 40 percent in MCL would be completely out of the consortium. HFCL's stake would be reduced to 35 percent after PortaCom's entry.</p>

<p>MANY ITEMS TO BE HIT BY NEW PRICE PROVISION</p>
<p>The list of goods on which excise duty will be levied on the basis of the maximum retail price might include detergents, cosmetics, personal toiletries and footwear. If these goods were so notified, market leaders such as Lakme, Hindustan Lever and Bata India were likely to be affected. The Finance Ministry might notify a list of such items and prescribe the procedure for levying excise on the retail sale price, after allowing deductions, of these goods after the Finance Bill receives the President's assent. The budget had introduced a provision empowering the government to levy excise duty on the retail sale price of some goods.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>LIFE INSURANCE CORP'S SECURITIES INVESTMENT TO BE LOWERED</p>
<p>The Life Insurance Corporation's (LIC) mandatory investments in securities will soon be lowered. A new level was yet to be determined, but there was talk that LIC's locked up funds, amounting to 75 percent of its corpus, should be brought closer to General Insurance Corporation's level of 45 percent. A policy decision was expected soon. LIC mopped up 120 billion rupees in savings in 1996/97 (April-March) and its investible corpus was growing at an annual rate of 19 percent.</p>

<p>TATA RAYTHEON AIRPORT PROJECT MOVES TOWARDS APPROVAL</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Ministry held a meeting to resolve the imbroglio over the international airport project near Bangalore by the Tata-led international consortium. The meeting was significant in light of the civil aviation minister's recent announcement saying the project was cleared on a build-own-transfer basis. Representatives of the Tata-Raytheon-Singapore Airport Authority consortium pressed for an early clearance of the project which was kept on hold for several months following differences between the civil aviation minister and the consortium on the ownership criteria.</p>

<p>BLEAK FUTURE AWAITS COMPANY SECRETARIES</p>
<p>Over 7,000 company secretaries would become redundant if the draft Companies Bill was approved by parliament. A new provision in the bill hiked the minimum paid-up equity capital limit for listed public companies to 20 million rupees from five million to warrant a full-time company secretary. At present it is mandatory for unlisted as well as listed public companies, with equity capital of five million rupees and above, to have a full-time company secretary.</p>

<p>$700 MLN WORLD BANK CREDIT LIKELY FOR RURAL BANKS</p>
<p>The government is all set to clinch a $700 million World Bank line of rural credit. A major chunk of this would be used to recapitalise regional rural banks (RRBs). The present equity structure of the RRBs might be changed following the infusion of World Bank funds. Currently, the government holds a 50 percent stake in RRBs, the sponsoring banks 35 percent, and state governments 15 percent.</p>

<p>INDIA SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ADB SOFT LOANS</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has said India should not be denied access to Asian Development Bank (ADB) soft loans. India and China were not given the virtually interest-free ADB loans on the grounds that the needs of these countries were so large that they could consume the entire fund. The minister said India satisfied the present objective criteria of the bank in getting access to Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources and, as such, should be given access. ADB officials said they had recommended India and China for limited access to ADF loans but many of the bank's 56 member-countries had opposed the idea.</p>

<p>AIR-INDIA, AIR FRANCE INK PACT TO FORM GLOBAL ALLIANCE</p>
<p>In a major bilateral initiative, Air-India and Air France have agreed to form a global alliance. They signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to increase the reach of the two international carriers and enhance passenger and cargo capacities between the two countries. As per the MoU, Air-India would be provided access to Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris. The two airlines also agreed upon code sharing on additional flights.</p>

<p>CORPORATE RESULTS LIKELY TO REBOUND</p>
<p>Major corporate houses might rebound from the poor performance of 1996/97 (April-March) to post improved results this year. A survey revealed several companies were likely to post sales and profit growth of between 25 and 50 percent for 1997/98. This compared favourably with the results for 1996/97, when several companies actually registered negative growth in these categories. While some firms were expected to post higher volumes, others would benefit from either improved prices or lower costs.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>ICICI TO REPORT MONTHLY AUDITED RESULTS</p>
<p>The Industrial Credit &amp; Investment Corporation (ICICI) will soon start declaring monthly audited financial results. As the financial institution had decided to tap the markets on a continuous basis to meet cash credit disbursements at a 13.5 percent medium-term lending rate, it would opt for quarterly audited financial results and soon move towards monthly audited financial results, a senior ICICI official said. The official said ICICI would be the first Indian organisation to declare audited quarterly financial results.</p>

<p>APEX BANK DIRECTIVE TO COMMERCIAL BANKS</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked commercial banks to provide for the difference between the provisions made by them for their non-performing assets (NPAs) and those reported by RBI inspectors in the financial statements of 1996/97 (April-March). From now on, banks would have to provide for their NPAs based on the assessment made by the RBI inspectors. The directive might send the 1996/97 profit projections of most of these banks haywire. The results of banks for the year ended March 1997 would see a sharp rise in provisions, since most of them underprovide for their NPAs, an RBI official said.</p>

<p>RBI MOPS UP $100 MLN AS RUPEE SURGES</p>
<p>The RBI mopped up about $100 million in the inter-bank foreign exchange market to curb the upward movement of the rupee. The rise was sparked by the finance minister's statement opposing RBI intervention to weaken the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar. The rupee opened at 35.86/35.87 four days ago and closed stronger at 35.84/35.85 the same day. Yesterday the rupee moved in a narrow range, opening at 35.84/35.85 and later climbed to 35.82/35.83. However, the reference rate was 35.83 per dollar as against 35.87 four days back.</p>

<p>BROADCAST FIRMS GEAR UP FOR LOBBYING</p>
<p>Domestic and foreign broadcasters plan to lobby the government to put across their respective views on the proposed broadcast bill. The Indian Broadcasters Association (IBA) resolved to send a joint communique to the government on the bill after examining its provisions threadbare. Some members of a special subcommittee on broadcasting, set up under the umbrella of the American Business Council (ABC), met to discuss the likely problems for U.S. broadcasters once a comprehensive broadcasting law was in place. IBA was lobbying the government for a ceiling on foreign equity in broadcasting joint ventures.</p>
