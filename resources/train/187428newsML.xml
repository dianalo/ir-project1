<p>Khmer Rouge guerrillas loyal to hardline leader Pol Pot have killed five soldiers in fresh clashes in northwest Cambodia, a government spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sieng Lapresse said the casualties came during the period between November 4-10, when seven government soldiers were also wounded by mines in the northwest province of Siem Reap.</p>
<p>He said a group of hardline Khmer Rouge guerrillas had attacked Eisan Chongkal village in the province, killing five soldiers, sometime during that period. He did not give a precise date or further details.</p>
<p>Government officials could not be reached in Siem Reap, which is about 300 km (185 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>The government has not reported fatal clashes with the Khmer Rouge for some time and it was not clear if the fighting signalled stepped up action as the dry season takes hold.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge was savaged by an internal split in August, when former top cadre Ieng Sary and loyal commanders in the northwest split with the hardliners and forged a ceasefire with the government.</p>
<p>Thousands of guerrillas in the northwest and southwest have since formally joined the government and donned royal armed forces uniforms, including Ieng Sary's soldiers.</p>
<p>The hardliners are grouped around the town of Anlong Veng to the north of Siem Reap and close to the Thai border.</p>
<p>Military analysts believe the army will try and seize these areas in the November-May dry season.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge, blamed for the deaths of more than one million people during Pol Pot's brutal 1975-79 rule, signed a U.N.-brokered peace pact with rival factions in 1991.</p>
<p>They later reneged on the accord and have been fighting a coalition government formed after general elections in 1993.</p>
