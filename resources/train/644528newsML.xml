<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan dollar ends at eight-year low.</title>
<headline>Taiwan dollar ends at eight-year low.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The recently depreciating Taiwan dollar closed at an eight-year low on Friday, reflecting persistent commercial demand for the U.S. dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>As it had for several days, the local unit again flirted with the central bank's T$27.9 defense level throughout the session -- trading at or below that level for hours before finishing at T$27.896 against Thursday's T$27.890 close.</p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was a modest US$179 million.  </p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar has not closed lower since its T$28.03 finish on January 7, 1989.</p>
<p>Dealers said the central bank appeared to be unwilling to let the Taiwan dollar break psychological support at T$27.90, at least not yet.</p>
<p>&quot;Just as in the past few days, the market continued to test T$27.90 but the central bank's defence was almost unbeatable,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank understands the Taiwan dollar is in a downtrend, but it doesn't want to see the rate falls below T$27.90 immediately for some reason,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar struggled in a narrow circle around T$27.893 and T$27.908 throughout the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The slowly depreciating trend won't change in the near term,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The central bank defended the dollar at T$27.5 through the 1990s but said in mid-1996 it was abandoning the policy, hinting a depreciation was welcome in the interest of stronger exports to help accelerate a stubbornly sluggish recovery.  </p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar has been on a long, slow decline since mid-January and recently has repeatedly flirted with T$27.9, prompting dealers to predict it would break support at T$28 in the second half -- but not until the central bank is ready.</p>
<p>Dealers said the local market would be watching the U.S. dollar's movement in major overseas centres following the announcement of key U.S. job data at 1230 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcome, a narrow trading range of T$27.88-92 was seen for Saturday.</p>
