<p>Officials from China and the United States will jointly investigate the site of the crash of a U.S. bomber in World War Two that was found in a remote Chinese valley in October, the China Daily said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The B-24 bomber and the remains of several crew members were found in a remote valley in China's southwestern Guangxi region in early October by two farmers collecting medicinal herbs.</p>
<p>Officials from the two countries will begin their investigation at the site in January, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Chinese president Jiang Zemin gave U.S. President Bill Clinton photographs of the wreckage and a videotape of the crash site when they met last month at the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Manila.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian handed over two dog tags recovered from the site during a meeting in Washington with U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry, China Daily said.</p>
<p>The names on the tags were those of two of 10 people on board a bomber that went missing on August 31, 1944 while on a run from an airstrip at Liuzhou in Guangxi, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The plane disappeared on its way back to the base after attacking Japanese warships in a Taiwan port, it said.</p>
