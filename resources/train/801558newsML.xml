<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's FTSE 100 shed 2.5 percent, sustaining its biggest one-day percentage drop since October 1992, as weakness on Wall Street and aggressive derivatives selling pushed the index below the 4,900 level, dealers and strategists said. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,865.8, down 125.5 points, or 2.51 percent. The index was down 165.5 on the week.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The German blue-chip DAX index fell nearly 2 percent over market dealings, tracking losses from electronic trading Thursday and then continuing a downward trend seen in recent days. The DAX-30 index closed at 4,152.86, down 78.57 points, or 1.86 percent. In later screen-based trade, the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,077.59, down 117.94 points, or 2.81 percent, a fall of 165.87 from last Friday.</p>
<p>PARIS - The French stock market is closed for a public holiday. On Thursday, the CAC-40 index closed at 2,921.84, down 2.20 points, or 0.08 percent, a drop of 74.43 from a week ago.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss stocks posted a sixth consecutive fall Friday to close nearly 1.5 percent lower on the back of weaker opening U.S. markets, a sagging dollar and derivatives-related selling. The Swiss market index closed at 5,498.5, down 81.0 points, or 1.45 percent, down 366.3 on the week.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index posted its biggest decline in two months, closing down 400.83 points, or 2.43 percent, at 16,096.88 as a rise in overnight rates fueled concerns about the Hong Kong dollar. For the week, the index was down 400.83.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian stock market ended on a firm note as stocks rebounded from losses earlier in the week, supported by a stronger bond market, positive earnings reports and some talk about another official rate cut. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,666.2, up 38.8 points, or 1.48 percent, down 45.2 from last Friday</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed moderately higher, as the yen's decline against the dollar invited buying in blue-chip exporters, brokers said. The 225-stock Nikkei average closed at 19,326.03, up 103.41 points, or 0.54 percent, a drop of 278.43 since last Friday.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African stocks ended firmly down after taking a late knock from weakness on Wall Street that added to local gloom about an ailing rand and bond market, dealers said. The All-Stock index closed at 7,439.8, down 90.5 points, or 1.20 percent, and down 159.4 from a week ago. The All-Gold index closed at 1,022.4, down 19.5 points, or 1.87 percent and up 26 on the week, while the Industrial index closed at 9,120.9, down 117.2 points, or 1.27 percent, and down 162.5 from last week.</p>
