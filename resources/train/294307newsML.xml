<p>Biospherics Inc said Tuesday it had received final payments from Denmark's MD Foods Ingredients on a license to manufacture a non-fattening sugar.</p>
<p>Biospherics, of Beltsville, Maryland, said it had received the remaining $750,000 in up-front money plus $1 million in non-refundable, advance royalties on the license to make the sugar, called D-tagatose.</p>
<p>The company, which developed the sugar, said it had received an initial payment of $750,000 from MD Foods in September.  </p>
<p>Under the $2.5 million agreement, MD Foods will build the plants, produce the sugar and market it for low-calorie products like baked goods and ice cream.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a significant deal for us,&quot; said Richard Levin, chief operating officer of Biospherics, adding that the Danish company will keep paying royalties on future sales, which should begin in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;If sales reach their projected levels, the license could be worth in excess of $500 million in pre-tax profit to the firm over the life of the license agreement,&quot; the company said in a news release.  </p>
<p>Levin said the life of the agreement had not been determined.</p>
<p>He said MD Foods, a dairy products and technology company, would also hire Biospherics to conduct further research.</p>
<p>D-tagatose is a natural, full bulk sugar.</p>
<p>It does not raise blood sugar levels when consumed, making it safe for diabetics, the company said.</p>
