<p>Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) has bought by tender 250,000 barrels of leaded and unleaded 95-octane reformate each at close to $29.00 per barrel, industry sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>CPC officials were unwilling to divulge the award prices. The cargoes are for April 1-15 delivery, on a cost-and-freight (c-and-f) basis to Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of the request of the winner, we have to keep the final price p-and-c (private and confidential) as they reduced the offer to a price more tolerable to CPC,&quot; the official said.  </p>
<p>The official said initial offers into the tender which closed on March 4 were at $29.00 to $29.50 per barrel c-and-f Keelung, Taichung, Kaohsiung or Shalung.</p>
<p>A CPC official told Reuters late Wednesday it had rejected offers and was seeking to negotiate with those who made the best offers.</p>
<p>In its last tender, CPC bought two unleaded reformate cargoes for March 16-30 delivery at $27.90 and $28.20 per barrel on a c-and-f basis respectively from a Dutch trader and a South Korean trader, traders said.</p>
