<p>The San Diego area, where 39 cult members committed suicide in the belief they would be transported to heaven by a UFO hiding behind a comet, has been the site of several notorious tragedies.</p>
<p>Rancho Santa Fe, the exclusive San Diego enclave where this week's deaths occurred, was rocked 4-1/2 years ago by a murder-suicide that made headlines around the world. Ian Spiro, a British businessman who reportedly worked for the CIA and the British secret service, shot his wife and three young children in November 1992 in their rented million-dollar home.</p>
<p>Spiro, apparently despondent over money woes, killed himself three days later with a lethal dose of cyanide. The family was subsequently found to be $5 million in debt.</p>
<p>One of the worst air crashes in U.S. history occurred in San Diego in 1978 when a commercial jet approaching San Diego airport was struck in mid-air by a small Cessna, killing all 144 people on board the two aircraft and seven on the ground.</p>
<p>In 1979, a 16-year-old girl shot and killed an elementary school principal, a janitor and eight children in the San Diego suburb of San Carlos with a rifle she had received as a Christmas present. She is serving 25 years to life in prison.</p>
<p>In one of the most shocking shooting sprees in U.S. history, James Huberty, 41, strolled into a crowded McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro on July 18, 1984, and opened fire, killing 20 people. He was later shot to death by police.</p>
<p>In 1985, a man killed his wife and four family members in the suburb of El Cajon. One year later, three men and a woman were killed in suburban College Grove, and in 1989 postal worker John Taylor shot and killed his wife and two co-workers. He killed himself a day later.</p>
<p>In 1993, a 19-year-old college student opened fire in a family fitness centre in El Cajon, killing four people before turning the gun on himself. And two years ago, an apparently deranged man killed five members of his family with a hammer, a knife and an axe in the suburb of Vista before setting fire to the house in a bid to cover up the murders. He subsequently confessed to the killings.</p>
