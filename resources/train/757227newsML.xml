<p>TOP STORIES</p>
<p>- Cambodia's foreign minister has told his ASEAN counterparts the events of July 5 and 6 have been legitimate and Phnom Penh will stand by the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. The events did not represent fighting between the Cambodian People's Party and Funcinpec, Ung Huot told the 30th ASEAN ministers' meeting. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
<p>- Coalition parties are unhappy with the draft charter but are reluctant to say outright whether they will vote for or against it for fear of going against public opinion. Only the key opposition Democrat Party has said it will endorse the draft despite its disagreement with several provisions. Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the New Aspiration leader, has been non-committal, saying only that he will rather allow his party members a free vote. (BANGKOK POST, THE NATION)</p>
<p>- The state should scrap the Hopewell contract and build the mass transit system itself or find other parties, the Transport and Communications Ministry suggests. A panel monitoring the project concludes the state should scrap the 30-year contract with the consent of Hopewell (Thailand) Co. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
