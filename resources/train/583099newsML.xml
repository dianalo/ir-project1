<p>An aide to Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila denied on Wednesday that rebel soldiers were involved in massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Major Arsene Loange told a news conference in Brussels that the killers were the same Rwandan Hutus who were responsible for the 1994 genocide in their home country.</p>
<p>&quot;Massacres are being perpetrated in the camps by healthy refugees against sick refugees in order put the blame on Alliance soldiers. The aim of these acts is to tarnish Kabila, in order to provoke a Western military intervention,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;These healthy refugees, the same criminals who are responsible for the genocide, are never shown on TV,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said refugees were also dying of hunger and starvation and in clashes with the local population as they tried to steal food in Zairean villages.</p>
<p>&quot;In the absence of soldiers of the Alliance, more useful at the front then as a police force around refugee camps, anything can happen between these starved people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva voiced concern about reports of fresh killings of Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire by Tutsi-dominated rebels in recent days.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said the UNHCR had reports that rebels had killed refugees near Mbandaka town, northeast of the capital Kinshasa on the Zaire river.</p>
<p>She said the UNHCR had reports of a presence of up to 50,000 Rwandan Hutus in the region. They are the remainder of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees who fled Rwanda in fear of reprisal for the Hutu-led genocide of minority Tutsis. Most of them returned to Rwanda late last year.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the French foreign ministry also accused the rebels of slaughtering refugees after taking Mbandaka.</p>
<p>&quot;How could we have done this, our soldiers are not even in Mbandaka, they are in the region, but not in the city,&quot; Loange said.</p>
