<p>Germany's market for securities repurchase agreements -- key instrument in money markets around the world -- has taken off after restrictions which drove much of this business to London were removed, according to the Bundesbank.</p>
<p>Relaxing rules dating back to 1948, the Bundesbank in December exempted securities repurchase agreements, or repos, with a maturity of up to one year from having to be secured with a deposit in the Bundesbank's non-interest bearing accounts.</p>
<p>The move was designed to promote wider use in Frankfurt of repo agreements, in which one party agrees to sell a security and buy it back later at a specific date.</p>
<p>According to a data published on Tuesday by the Landeszentralbank in Hesse, the Bundesbank's branch in Frankfurt, the move appears to be working.</p>
<p>The bank said that by the end of March this year the total volume of securities repurchase agreements, or repos, swelled to 31 billion marks from seven billion marks at the same time a year earlier.</p>
<p>And according to a survey it conducted of the four most active repo-trading banks in Frankfurt that included previously unreported repo transactions, the outstanding amount of repos stood at 65 billion marks as of the end of March this year, more than twice the 29 billion mark figure for a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Initial banking statistics indicate a brisk development of the repo business,&quot; the report said. &quot;The reserve-exemption of the repo business is another step toward strengthening the competitive role of the Frankfurt centre internationally.&quot;</p>
<p>Banks had long bemoaned the fact that Germany, almost alone among major nations, subjected repos to minimum reserve requirements and had lobbied for them to be exempted.</p>
<p>Aside from typically being a safe investment, repos are used for arbitraging between spot markets, forward markets and term money markets, promoting a smooth interaction between money and capital markets.</p>
<p>According to the report, liberalisation of the repo market has made it more accessible to banks other than the top handful that rule Germany's financial community.</p>
<p>It said that the use of repos by regional and foreign banks had increased and that a &quot;considerable&quot; volume of repo business had returned to Frankfurt from London.</p>
<p>Indeed, credit institutions gave the state central bank a long list of reasons for preferring repos to other securities, with many reporting they were increasingly using repos in money market dealings which until now been mostly connected with securities transactions.</p>
<p>Commercial banks said the repo market offers greater market depth than the traditional money markets and an easier turnover of large volumes.</p>
<p>They also said that capital adequacy requirements for banks' exposures are lower for collateralised transactions like repos than for traditional money market transactions.</p>
<p>In addition, repos are not usually counted against trading limits which banks practice internally against other institutions so that there are greater opportunities for interbank dealings.</p>
<p>With a repo market much smaller than in other major industrialised nations including Japan, France and the United States, there is ample room for repo business in Frankfurt to grow larger still, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Market participants estimate that DM repo market holds a substantial potential for further development.&quot;</p>
