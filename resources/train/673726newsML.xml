<title>USA: Florida gaining in war against citrus pests.</title>
<headline>Florida gaining in war against citrus pests.</headline>

<p>With a fleet of helicopters and airplanes, with bulldozers and matches, Florida is fighting a pesky fly and a stubborn bacterium that threaten the state's $8 billion citrus industry.</p>
<p>Since the discovery during the past three weeks of the dreaded agriculture pests citrus canker and the Mediterranean fruit fly on the state's west coast, Florida has launched a multimillion-dollar air and land war to protect the health and reputation of one of its most important businesses.</p>
<p>Dozens of agriculture workers fanned out across the Tampa Bay area in recent days, checking and setting traps, spraying pesticide and answering increasingly strident questions from residents grown weary of the battle.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably the largest outbreak of Medfly since 1981,&quot; said Bobby McKown, vice-president of Florida Citrus Mutual, an industry trade group. &quot;But we have every reason to believe the eradication effort will be a success.&quot;</p>
<p>In Manatee County to the south of Tampa, groves have been marked for bulldozing and burning, the only way to get rid of canker.</p>
<p>The war on the Medfly began May 28 with the discovery of several fruit flies and some larvae, and escalated steadily as more than 200 flies were found in traps scattered around Tampa's Hillsborough County.</p>
<p>A small fleet of helicopters and World War II-vintage DC-3s has been put to work spraying corn syrup laced with the pesticide malathion over urban Tampa and the county.</p>
<p>By Wednesday the affected zone covered 522 square miles and its boundary lay just three miles from Polk County, Florida's citrus heartland.</p>
<p>Fewer flies have been found in recent days, leading officials to believe they might be gaining the upper hand after having to expand the spray zone continually during the early days of the airborne war.</p>
<p>&quot;We started off actually chasing the Medflies,&quot; said U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Nolan Lemon. &quot;But finally our focus is starting to be to work from the outside in.&quot;</p>
<p>If the Medfly infestation were not enough, an outbreak of the virulent Asian strain of citrus canker appeared in Manatee County south of Tampa. Canker is a bacterial infection that discolours fruit and kills citrus trees.</p>
<p>Near the town of Palmetto, whole groves have been marked for burning. Eight groves or portions of groves have been found to be infected, covering about 400 acres.</p>
<p>A separate canker battle has been raging in Miami for nearly two years, during which agriculture workers have destroyed about 37,000 trees, often over vociferous protests from residents and attack dogs, Florida Department of Agriculture spokesman Leon Hebbs said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a lot easier in the groves,&quot; he said. &quot;The grove owners are very cooperative because this is their livelihood. And they don't have dogs.&quot;</p>
<p>Hebbs downplayed suggestions that Medflies or canker will cause any increase in citrus prices, noting that the flies have not yet reached commercial groves and the canker had affected 400 acres out of 900,000 in citrus production.</p>
<p>McKown said the pests could have come at a worse time. The current harvest was almost finished. &quot;There was not a great deal of fruit still to be picked,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Florida has been battling such plagues since 1929 when the Medfly was first found in the state. The battles are costly. The current fight has a budget of $7 million and rising.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, workers burned millions of trees, only to learn later that a bacterial infection was not canker but another type of tree pest, McKown said.</p>
<p>Anti-Medfly spraying has always generated controversy. A bank of phones at Tampa Medfly headquarters rings constantly with questions and complaints.</p>
<p>Officials said there was no evidence, contrary to reports, that the pests may have come in smuggled fruit from Canada.</p>
<p>The spray can damage auto paint and officials admit it could harm fish in ponds. Tampa is the nation's tropical fish farming capital.</p>
<p>Some residents say it could harm humans.</p>
<p>Thalia Potter, an activist with Citizens for Responsible Application of Malathion, said the Medfly programme has run roughshod over environmental laws and officials have ignored a study that found a type of malathion can break down into a byproduct shown to cause genetic damage to mice.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have a Mickey Mouse Gulf War going on down here,&quot; Potter said. &quot;They have come swooping with full force, using all the technology at their command.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there may be health repercussions down the line, unintended consequences,&quot; she said.</p>
