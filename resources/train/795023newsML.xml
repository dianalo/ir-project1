<p>Hong Kong has rejected former Merrill Lynch private banker Kevin Wallace's application to travel to Singapore to face a court cross-examination on his assets, his Singapore lawyer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Kevin's application has been turned down by the High Court and Justice Department in Hong Kong,&quot; Vinodh Coomaraswamy told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong court also rejected his application last week to set aside an injunction freezing his assets worldwide.</p>
<p>An appeal in Singapore to remove a similar injunction against Wallace was rejected by the High Court here a week ago.</p>
<p>Wallace's lawyer in Hong Kong had submitted a letter to ask for permission to travel to Singapore, where Merrill lodged a civil suit against its former top private banker. The Singapore High Court set an August 7 deadline for his return.</p>
<p>Coomaraswamy said that Merrill's lawyers would have to either question him in Hong Kong by going there or by satellite video.</p>
<p>In June, Merrill Lynch sued Wallace in Hong Kong and Singapore and filed a criminal complaint in Singapore. No criminal charges have yet been brought in Singapore.</p>
<p>The investment bank accused the 46-year-old American of unauthorised trading, misrepresenting or falsifying private clients' statements and forging client signatures.</p>
<p>Wallace was employed as a financial consultant to wealthy clients in Asia from late 1991 until his dismissal on May 15. He is now facing criminal charges in Hong Kong for money laundering but has been released on bail of more than HK$1 million (US$129,000).</p>
<p>His passport has been impounded by the courts.</p>
