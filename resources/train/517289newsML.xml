<p>Philippine shares, ignoring the Dow's overnight bounce, sank in modest trading on Thursday and analysts said they expected the market to remain in the doldrums in the days or even weeks ahead.</p>
<p>A drop by market heavyweight PLDT in New York helped drag down the key index, which fell by 33.10 points, or 1.12 percent, to 2,927.87 after two days of technical gains.</p>
<p>All sub-indices closed with losses, with the mining sector taking the biggest drop of 2.56 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is still fundamentally sound except that people are still on wait and see,&quot; senior analyst Ramon Saulo of Asiamerit Securities Inc said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is in a sort of suspended animation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Traders said the $0 3/8 fall of PLDT in Wall Street was not significant but prevailing bearish sentiment in the local bourse made it susceptible to the negative news.</p>
<p>&quot;It's basically a continuing caution on the part of investors who at this point are still going through liquidity reallocation and review of portfolio considering that we've just finished the tax season,&quot; said chief economist Villamor Vital of All-Asia Capital and Trust Corp.</p>
<p>The onset of the summer vacation, which spurred many investors to go on holidays, also partly explained the low liquidity in the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will see a more active market by the time we get to May when summer vacation is over,&quot; Vital said.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners are definitely still out of the market ... Some signs will have to appear before there's really a big push,&quot; Saulo said.</p>
<p>Joey Roxas, president at Eagle Securities, said lingering perception of a glut in the property market continued to feed market scepticism.</p>
<p>Property stock Megaworld Properties &amp; Holdings Inc was among the days biggest losers in the sector, falling 6.25 percent to six pesos while its unit Empire East Land Holdings Inc lost 4.92 percent to settle at 5.80 pesos.</p>
