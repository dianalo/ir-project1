<p>Five children died on Sunday when they stepped on mines in the breakaway Russian region of Chechnya, Russian news agencies said.</p>
<p>The accident took place near a road about 10 km (six miles) from Chechnya's capital Grozny, Itar-Tass news agency quoted Chechen deputy prime minister Movladi Udugov as saying. The five, all boys, were aged between 10 and 12.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Udugov as saying that the incident was &quot;related to a series of terrorist acts committed in recent days on the territory of Chechnya&quot;.</p>
<p>Six staffers of the International Committee of the Red Cross were murdered in their sleep at a Red Cross hospital compound southwest of Grozny last Tuesday, and six members of an ethnically mixed Grozny family were shot the following day.</p>
<p>A Russian family of four was killed at their home in Grozny on Friday in what officials also called a political act.</p>
