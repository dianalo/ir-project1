<title>ROMANIA: ROMANIA OTC MARKET SLIGHTLY DOWN.</title>
<headline>ROMANIA OTC MARKET SLIGHTLY DOWN.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-07-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Romania's over-the-counter (OTC) market closed slightly weaker on Thursday as most investors were reluctant to buy at high prices, traders said.</p>
<p>They said both foreign and local investors were still waiting for prices declines and stayed away from big deals.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the present situation will continue for a while,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Traders said a fall of the leu during the day to 7,400/500 to the dollar, from its opening level of 7,200/260, had no impact on foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;The depreciation of the leu was too small. None of the dollar holders rushed to buy on the assumption of a cheaper leu,&quot; one said. &quot;The picture would change at 10,000 to the dollar&quot;.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the downtrend to continue, with supply exceeding demand.</p>
<p>The VAB-RA all-share index fell 0.4 percent from Wednesday's levels to 6,448.3 points.</p>
<p>Gainers led losers by 209 to 127 on Wednesday, while prices for 265 stocks were flat.</p>
<p>Selling pressure weakened prices for cement makers and several other high-caps, including Turbomecanisa SA engine aircraft maker, which closed weaker at 67,000 after it opened at 71,000.</p>
