<p>Three people died and nearly 30 were rescued from a fire on the upper floors of a 25-storey building in India's financial capital Bombay on Wednesday, officials said.</p>
<p>The blaze began at Express Towers, in the prestigious Nariman Point business district, which houses the Indian Express newspaper on the ground and first floor, and a number of domestic and multinational companies and banks.</p>
<p>&quot;Three people died in a room on the twenty-second floor that had been locked on the inside,&quot; city official Shridhar Joshi told Reuters.</p>
<p>A police official said the three dead men were local canteen staff working for Pfizer Ltd, a U.S. pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>A fire control room official said firefighters had put out the flames on the twenty-first floor, where the blaze apparently started, and had nearly extinguished the fire on the higher levels.</p>
<p>Other Pfizer employees told Reuters how they fled the blaze.</p>
<p>&quot;I was working in my office at 8.20 (a.m.) (0250 GMT) on the 22nd floor,&quot; said Roshan Sadhu, sales manager for Pfizer. &quot;It was 8.22 when I heard the fire alarm bells and I came down by lift with a colleague and six canteen boys.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The smoke was billowing, I couldn't see in front of my nose, suddenly a lift door opened in front of me and I got in,&quot; another Pfizer employee told Reuters, her lips still trembling with shock.</p>
<p>The fire broke out shortly after 8.00 a.m. (0230 GMT) as early office workers arrived at their desks.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later the building would have been filled with around 5,000 office and newspaper employees.</p>
<p>Bank of America and Bank of India both have their main Bombay offices in Express Towers.</p>
<p>Other companies located there include German pharmaceuticals firm Bayer, the German airline Lufthansa, and multinational advertising agency Lintas. A branch of the State Bank of India is also in the tower block.</p>
<p>City officials said firemen had rescued six people who were trapped in an elevator on the twenty-first floor while the fire was blazing.</p>
<p>Vivek Goenka, the managing editor of the Indian Express, and his wife Ananya were in their penthouse suite when the fire broke out.</p>
<p>&quot;We heard the alarms, saw the smoke billowing and then security came up to escort us down. We came down by elevator because the fire had not spread at that stage,&quot; Ananya Goenka told Reuters.</p>
<p>She said other people had fled to the rooftop terrace and who were later brought down by a staircase, but a naval helicopter circled the tower in case an airlift was needed.</p>
<p>Around 30 fire engines and 280 firemen and officials helped fight the blaze.</p>
