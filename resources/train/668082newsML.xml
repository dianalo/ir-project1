<p>Kmart Corp. on Monday sold most of its money-losing Canadian discount retail chain to an investor group for C$185 million ($134 million).</p>
<p>Troy, Mich.-based Kmart had been seeking to sell Kmart Canada Co. for about two years. Kmart Canada lost C$4 million ($2.8 million) in the first quarter ended April 30, versus a breakeven year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Analysts said the ownership change did not ensure smooth selling for Canada's sixth biggest department store chain.</p>
<p>Buyers of the 123-store retailer were York Management Services Inc., Cherokee Ventures Canada Inc. and a unit of the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, a government-owned public pension fund manager.</p>
<p>Cherokee is a member of Denver-based investment firm Cherokee Group of Companies, while York is a New Jersey-based investment and management firm.</p>
<p>Kmart maintained a 12.5 percent stake in Kmart Canada and said it did not see the deal resulting in further writedowns of the Canadian operation.</p>
<p>Congress Financial Corp. provided a C$135 million ($97 million) line of credit to Kmart Canada, which has been losing market share for years and holds about eight percent of the market.</p>
<p>Canadian retailers have struggled for the past few years due to an economic downturn and the 1994 arrival of Wal-Mart Canada Inc., a subsidiary of the world's largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc..</p>
<p>Wal-Mart now has the biggest slice of the Canadian department store market, at 24 percent, followed by Zellers Inc., a unit of Hudson's Bay Co., at 23 percent.</p>
<p>William Chisholm, analyst with brokerage Deacon Capital, said the credit line would help prop up the retailer in the short run.</p>
<p>But he said the new managers might not succeed where Kmart failed. &quot;If Kmart themselves couldn't see turning it around longerterm and making it an attractive business, it doesn't sound to me as though this group would be that much smarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Consultant Richard Talbot said the new management must turn Kmart Canada around after years of neglect when the chain was on the block.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not impossible to turn it around,&quot; Talbot said, &quot;but they have to be come far more focused and far more sophisticated than they are right now.&quot;</p>
<p>The new owners appointed George Heller as Kmart Canada chief executive. Heller is a former Zellers executive and was most recently a senior executive with privately held Canadian shoe company Bata Industries.</p>
<p>Kmart Canada posted 1996 sales of more than C$1.1 billion ($794 million), and employed 12,600 full and part-time workers.</p>
