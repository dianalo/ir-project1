<p>The U.K. government approved plans for the phase two development of the Bruce field in the North Sea, British Petroleum Plc said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>An additional 728 billion standard cubic feet of gas and about 61 million barrels of oil and condensate will be accessed in the phase two development and drilling is expected to start in the second half of 1997, BP said.</p>
<p>Total investment in the field will reach 1.6 billion stg with phase two, from 1.25 billion stg as of the end of 1996, it said.</p>
<p>Most of the additional reserves will be produced by a sub-sea development of the western area of the field, which is located 350 km northeast of Aberdeen and is one of the largest fields in the U.K., BP said.  </p>
<p>The field will be linked by a bundled pipeline to facilities on a new steel platform, which will include a high pressure gas compressor to inject gas back into the reservoir, it said.</p>
<p>The platform will be linked to existing Bruce platforms.</p>
<p>First production is planned for October 1998 with peak rates expected at 450 million cubic feet of gas and 45,000 barrels per day of hydrocarbon liquids, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;The production of gas from the western area will ensure that the Bruce field maintains sales of gas at plateau rates well beyond the year 2000,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Three wells and another pre-drilled well will be completed before an eight-well manifold is installed in the summer of 1998, BP said.</p>
<p>The remaining four wells to be tied back to the first manifold, are expected to be drilled in 1999.</p>
<p>BP said a second eight-well manifold is expected to be added in the summer of 2001 with drilling continuing into the year 2003.</p>
<p>BP said the Bruce field has original reserves of at least 2.6 trillion cubic feet of gas and 212 million barrels of hydrocarbon liquids.</p>
