<p>IMM currency futures finished mixed, as December sterling set a fresh contract high, while yen and Continental European contracts remained on the defensive, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>December sterling established a contract high at $1.6080, breezing above the key resistance level of $1.6000, on heavy speculative and mutual fund buying, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling had a nice retracement over the last few days, and was able to generate good momentum,&quot; one cash trader said. &quot;There is still the feeling that you buy sterling on dips.&quot;  </p>
<p>Over the last several sessions, sterling futures languished below the old contract high of $1.5996 due to profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling is now a viable high-yielder,&quot; one trader said, referring to the decline in some European interest rates.</p>
<p>Mark and Swiss franc futures remained lower, with December marks erasing gains achieved on the back of Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer's comments.</p>
<p>&quot;Tietmeyer sounded much more militant,&quot; another trader said. Tietmeyer said that he sees no need for further interest rate cuts in the foreseeable future.  </p>
<p>December mark's rose to a weekly high of $0.6617, above the high on GLOBEX at $0.6616, or 1.5136 spot, on Tietmeyer's comments. Prior to his statements, the dollar was flirting with the 1.5250 spot, or $0.6578 in December marks.</p>
<p>One cash trader said buying was extremely heavy for mark/yen amid talk of a large options position at the 74.50 level.</p>
<p>&quot;Yards were going through,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the floor, activity was dominated in the Mexican peso pit. One firm bought 1,000 December pesos at $0.120000, the day's low, even though the contract downticked to $0.119500.  </p>
<p>Traders covered short positions on anticipation that Mexican officials would intervene in the currency market and prop up pesos. However, the intervention did not materialize, sending peso futures sharply lower.</p>
<p>&quot;If we trade below $0.120000 for any length of time, pesos will fall hard,&quot; one floor trader said.</p>
<p>He estimated 9,000 contracts traded in December and 1,000 in March pesos.</p>
<p>Another trader said Mexican corporates were underhedged.</p>
<p>&quot;They are a trifle nervous,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>At the end of pit trade, December yen was off $0.000046 at $0.008874, marks fell $0.0006 at $0.6595, Swiss francs were $0.0028 at $0.7970, sterling rose $0.0124 at $1.6048, Canadian dollars were up $0.0001 at $0.7457, Australian dollars were $0.0022 lower at $0.7888, and Mexican pesos were $0.000500 lower at $0.121950. -Derivatives desk 312-408-8750;E-mail derivatives@reuters.com</p>
