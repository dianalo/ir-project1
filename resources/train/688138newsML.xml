<p>The United States will release a report next week about commerce on the Internet, which could account for up to a fifth of global retail trade in a decade, a senior White House advisor said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ira Magaziner, senior adviser to President Clinton on Public Policy, said the nine-point Framework for Global Electronic Commerce would outline strategies for buying and selling on the Internet and other electronic networks.</p>
<p>Internet commerce could account for between 10 and 20 percent of global retail sales within a decade, with a far bigger percentage in the United States, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe within the next decade, electronic commerce potentially will become our largest area of trade for the U.S.,&quot; Magaziner told a news conference at the opening of an Internet Society conference in the Malaysian capital.</p>
<p>The White House report, to be unveiled by Vice President Al Gore on July 1, would cover issues including taxation and tariffs, a uniform commercial code, electronic payments, technical standards, contracts, privacy, content, inter-operability and encryption.</p>
<p>The United States hopes &quot;to achieve some global agreement on frameworks for electronic commerce...by January 1, 2000,&quot; Magaziner said.</p>
<p>In pursuing this aim, Magaziner said U.S. officials were meeting with public and private organisations to seek their views. &quot;We don't believe our strategy has all the answers.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. representatives would be holding meetings in Europe, Japan and South Korea later this year.</p>
<p>Magaziner said he had already introduced some aspects of the report to the Malaysian and Singaporean governments during his visit to the two countries this week.</p>
<p>Singapore has begun wiring up every home, office and business with fibre optic cable so they can get high-speed access to the Internet under a programme called Singapore One.</p>
<p>Malaysia is building a &quot;Multimedia Super Corridor&quot; for global information technology companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Malaysia and Singapore have been leaders in the area of the Internet,&quot; Magaziner said, adding there has been &quot;some very advanced thinking&quot; in the two countries about information technology.</p>
<p>Magaziner stressed the primacy of the private sector in developing electronic commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;The private sector should lead that process, not governments,&quot; he said.</p>
