<p>Czech inflation continued its downtrend in April and, while industrial output contracted for the third consecutive month, analysts said they see little chance of a change in the central bank's tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>The statistical bureau (CSU) said on Monday that monthly consumer inflation in April was 0.6 percent, putting the year-on-year rate at 6.7 percent. In March, the year-on-year rate stood at 6.8 percent and at 8.5 percent in April 1996.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CSU said that industrial output, as it had done in the previous two months, contracted, shrinking 2.5 percent year-on-year in March. Output for the first quarter was down 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>It added that real construction output for March grew by 2.0 percent, year-on-year, after a 1.6 percent, year-on-year.</p>
<p>Analysts said the data was in line with expectations, and that the central bank appears unrelenting in its battle against inflation even at the cost of economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The pressure from the government (to lower rates) has been quite strong, and it is quite clear that this will continue,&quot; said Zdenek Tuma, chief economist at Patria Finance.</p>
<p>&quot;But I believe it is not so important to have major growth this year. The crucial point is how much the economy will grow in the mid and longer-term, so low inflation is very important,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Last summer the CNB implemented a series of tightening moves, including raising its key discount rate by one percentage point to 10.5 percent.</p>
<p>Another of the central bank's main concerns has been the inflationary pressures brought about by rising wages.</p>
<p>The CSU said average industrial monthly wages grew, in nominal terms, 14.6 percent, year-on-year, in March, after 11.4 percent growth in February.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Josef Tosovsky has said that wage growth is a key problem for the economy and said it could not afford more than a nominal 10 percent rise in pay in 1997 after nominal gross wages grew 18 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;All of these figures are in line with forecasts,&quot; said one London-based analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the central bank appears to have the view that it will wait for figures on the trade balance and balance of payments and not give too much weight to economic growth at this point,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The next trade figures -- for April -- are scheduled to be released on May 26. The trade deficit for the first three months of the year was 40.2 billion crowns, up from 27.1 billion for the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expect the inflation downtrend to continue into June, though a series of rent and energy price deregulations in July could add as much as three percentage points to the year-on-year rate.</p>
<p>The Czech crown was unfazed by the economic data, trading in a narrow range for most of the day.</p>
<p>The central bank fixed the crown at 2.47 percent on the depreciation side of its dollar/mark basket parity on Monday, even with the market.</p>
