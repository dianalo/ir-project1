<p>Lithuanian independence hero Vytautas Landsbergis said he expected a more just Lithuania should he seal his political comeback in the Baltic state's second round of parliamentary elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a better and more just Lithuania (after the election),&quot; said the former music professor as he cast his vote in Vilnius, the capital of the former Soviet republic that declared independence in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that we will form a government with the Christian Democrats,&quot; he added confidently.</p>
<p>Polling booths in Lithuania opened at 0500 GMT and will close at 1900 GMT in the second round of the election in which 65 of the 130 or so candidates earning majority support will win a place in the 141-seat parliament.</p>
<p>The first round of the election on October 20 allocated blocks in parliament to political parties.</p>
<p>Twenty-four parties spanning the political spectrum were in the running but only five got past the five percent requirement to gain entry into the parliament.</p>
<p>Landsbergis' Homeland Union took 33 of the 70 seats allocated to parties and its future coalition partner, the Christian Democrats, won 11 seats.</p>
<p>The former Communists, the Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDLP), who unseated Landsbergis' Sajudis party four years ago in a political shocker, took only 10.</p>
<p>The populist Centre Union won nine while the Social Democrats got seven.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union also took two seats in the first round under the majority vote system being contested on Sunday.</p>
<p>These were won by Landsbergis and chairman of the party's board, Gediminas Vagnorius, tipped to be the next prime minister. Neither needs to stand again in Sunday's election.</p>
<p>The results from four districts were declared invalid and will be held again next spring because less than 40 percent of the eligible voters came to the polling stations.</p>
<p>A clear victory on Sunday would cap a comeback for Landsbergis, 65, who suffered a humiliating electoral defeat four years ago at the hands of his ex-communist foes after leading his nation's bid to free itself from 50 years of Soviet rule.</p>
<p>Landsbergis earned wide admiration for his courageous defiance of Moscow, climaxing in a bloody attack on the Vilnius TV tower in January 1991 by an armoured KGB unit in which 13 Lithuanians were killed.</p>
<p>But Lithuania's 3.7 million population, reeling from the economic pain inflicted by the transition to a market economy, dumped him in 1992 in favour of the LDLP.</p>
<p>Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, the former LDLP leader who will now face a French-style period of &quot;cohabitation&quot; with the new right-of-centre parliament, said he expected the country's foreign policy to stay on course.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign policy will not change in the new parliament because all the parties support our orientation,&quot; he told reporters as he voted on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lithuania is bidding hard for entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Union (EU), regarding membership as a shield from a potentially hostile Russia in the future.</p>
