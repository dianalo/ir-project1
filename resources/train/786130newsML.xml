<title>SWITZERLAND: ABB CEO HAS NO DOUBTS ABOUT BAKUN.</title>
<headline>ABB CEO HAS NO DOUBTS ABOUT BAKUN.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-08-07</dateline>

<p>Goran Lindahl, chief executive officer of ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG, said he had no doubt that the Bakun hydroelectric dam project would go ahead and said the current discussions with the developer were not unusual.  </p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubts the project will go ahead. These type of discussions are not unusual with these large, complex and visible-type projects,&quot; Lindahl told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a little bit of massaging to get all the details together,&quot; he said, adding he had experienced similar discussions some 20 years ago.</p>
<p>ABB and the main developer of the Bakun dam, Ekran Bhd, have been in discussions over the project, whose total value is $6.18 billion with the value of the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) amounting to $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Bakun contract is the largest ever awarded to ABB and the value of the contract to ABB exceeds $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Last week the Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said the government may intervene to resolve the dispute and there was a remote possibility that the contract would be cancelled if the terms were found to be unfair.</p>
<p>Lindahl said further meetings with Ekran were scheduled next week and the following week and he expected the issues to be resolved in a &quot;reasonably short time&quot;.</p>
<p>He said people involved in these discussions use all the arguments they can and also air these in the press.</p>
<p>&quot;The project is needed and the project is wanted and therefore we need to go out and have the few remaining issues brought to the table,&quot; Lindahl said.</p>
