<headline>INSIGHT - FTSE to weaken to 4,670-4,680 region.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-19</dateline>

<p>A swift markdown in early trading on the London stock market may take the FTSE 100 index down to 4,670 before stabilising which could take it up to 4,680, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>A 139-point plunge by the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday has signalled the end of the bull run in London for the time being but it's possible that the FTSE will spin back as the week progresses, they added.</p>
<p>By 0721 GMT, the FTSE was indicated down 14.7 at 4,679.2 and on Friday the Dow closed 7,194.67, or down 1.89 percent.  </p>
<p>Friday's positive approach by the FTSE to power through 4,700 intra-day ran into trouble owing to a lack of support by the Dow while London was still open.</p>
<p>The sharp pullback by the Dow after London had closed will mean the FTSE must follow suite to some extent.</p>
<p>A tick chart of the FTSE over the FTSE over the past three days shows it has managed to avoid a bearish double-top pattern only to be replaced by sideways consolidation between 4,650 and 4,725 so that today's action should be part of that consolidation phase, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Further weakness on Wall Street today and tomorrow will mean the FTSE will at least test the lower limit of its consolidation band -- perhaps falling below it -- owing to fears of an interest rate rise in the U.S. this week.</p>
<p>Such an event may take the FTSE down to 4,600, but provided this level holds over the next day or so there is a chance it can bounce back later in the week owing to the influence of a medium-term uptrend which began in mid-April and from which it has gained around 10 percent, analysts said.</p>
