<p>Zairean rebels on Thursday said French policy-makers are split between an old guard opposed to their aims and a new generation of more pragmatic advisers.</p>
<p>Kakudji Gaetan, rebel foreign commissioner, told reporters in the eastern city of Goma he had spent a month pleading the rebel viewpoint in France and Belgium at unofficial meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;During my visit to Europe I met no minister but I met some advisers to the ministers who belong to the new generation and I am very happy they understand our position,&quot; Kakudji said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately they are not in a position to make any decisions.&quot;</p>
<p>The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) accuses Paris of doing everything it can to frustrate rebel goals and ensure the survival of ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is backed by France.</p>
<p>Since launching its rebellion in October with a force of mostly ethnic Tutsis, the ADFL has seized most of eastern Zaire and says Kisangani, Zaire's third largest city, is surrounded.</p>
<p>Kakudji would not name the new generation in Paris which he said questions the policies of the old guard dominated by President Jacques Chirac, Foreign Minister Herve de Charette and former interior minister Charles Pasqua.</p>
<p>France on Wednesday called for a multinational force to be sent to east Zaire if rebels refused to agree to a ceasefire, saying the world had to intervene to protect Rwandan Hutu refugees and Zairean civilians.</p>
<p>&quot;The military intervention in Zaire would be to protect Mobutu and his allies and prevent us from achieving our goal which is to liberate the whole country,&quot; said Kakudji.</p>
<p>The AFDL says France's position is to guard its business interests and avoid losing influence to the United States in a region in which France, with colonial and linguistic ties, has been predominant.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a matter of English speakers sweeping away French speakers. It is a matter of everybody having a chance to work within a free market economy to rebuild the country after it is liberated,&quot; said Kakudji.</p>
<p>The United States has good relations with neighbouring Rwanda, which has a Tutsi-dominated army and backs the rebels.</p>
<p>France, like Mobutu, was close to Rwanda's former Hutu-led government which was swept away by Tutsi rebels in 1994 following the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>
<p>Belgium, which in 1960 relinquished its colonial hold over what was then known as the Congo, is accused by the rebels of following France in its foreign policy in central Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;Officially Belgium is not in favour of the Alliance, however some of the people I met do understand why we are fighting but as in France these people don't hold positions which make decisions,&quot; said Kakudji.</p>
<p>Belgium, France and the United States formed a troika of powers to drive Mobutu towards democracy in the early 1990s. But divergent interests left the united front looking shaky even before the war.</p>
<p>At stake in Zaire, the most populous nation in French- speaking Africa, is its vast mineral wealth -- including some of the world's richest unexploited reserves of copper and cobalt, as well as gold, diamonds and other metals.</p>
<p>Mobutu, Zaire's president for 31 years, has spent much of his time at his villa in the south of France since undergoing surgery for prostate cancer in Switzerland in August last year.</p>
