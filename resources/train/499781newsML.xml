<p>A Palestinian who blew up a Tel Aviv cafe last month, killing himself and three Israeli women, had not planned a suicide attack but his bomb detonated before he could get away, the army said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Israeli security officials had said the March 21 (corrects from March 18) blast bore all the hallmarks of a suicide bombing. Witnesses said the explosion occurred shortly after an Arab man put down a bag he was carrying.</p>
<p>But the army, announcing the discovery of a missing soldier's body in the bomber's West Bank village of Sourif, said Mousa Ghneimat of the militant Moslem group Hamas had not planned on dying in the explosion in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>&quot;Ghneimat set the delaying device of the charge and entered the Apropo cafe with the intention of placing the bomb and leaving the site,&quot; the army said in a statement. &quot;Because of a fault, the bomb exploded before he could leave the cafe.&quot;</p>
<p>It said Ghneimat had an accomplice, now in Israeli custody, who had been waiting outside the cafe to drive the bomber away.</p>
<p>The alleged getaway driver, Rhad Abu Hamadia, and Ghneimat belonged to a six-man Hamas squad which the army said was responsible for the kidnapping and killing of Sergeant Sharon Edri, who disappeared last September in central Israel.</p>
<p>Edri's body was found buried in an olive grove in Sourif on Thursday. The army said the Hamas squad members, from Sourif and the nearby town of Hebron, had killed 11 Israelis since early 1996.</p>
