<p>Indian shares drifted lower on Saturday as market players awaited political developments for direction after the government was defeated in a parliamentary vote overnight, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;People sat out on the sidelines after a flurry at the start,&quot; said Bharat Dalal, a partner at brokerage Sanat Dalal, adding that investors were unwilling to take positions as uncertainties loomed large.</p>
<p>The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange top 30 share index finished 44.01 points, or 1.21 percent, lower at 3,589.72.</p>
<p>Business volumes were low but there were buyers at lower levels indicating a downside may be limited, traders said.</p>
<p>The market was held together by hopes a widely welcomed budget would be approved and bickering politicians would sort out their differences to avert a snap poll.</p>
<p>The Congress party said it will back the United Front to form a new coalition provided it changed its leader, defeated prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Prashant Purker, head of institutional sales at Peregrine Capital India, said the market was already largely discounting the optimistic scenario, of a passed budget and new coalition.</p>
<p>Dalal said there was no threat to the market so long as there was assurance of a government and continuity of policies.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's waiting for definite direction,&quot; said Sanjeev Choithani at brokerage Pashupati Advani. &quot;If a coalition emerges quickly it could take the market up 100-150 points.&quot;</p>
<p>But Jyoti Prakash at Calcutta brokerage C. Mackertich said people were looking at selling shares in the hope they could buy them back at cheaper rates.</p>
<p>Foreign investors were disturbed by the political developments but will not dump shares, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see a major sell-off,&quot; said Bharat Iyer, market strategist at UBS Securities, the investment arm of Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>
<p>The National exchange index slipped 10.15 points to 1,003.25, the Delhi index 8.69 points to 753.05 and the Madras index 21.19 to 3,470.82.</p>
