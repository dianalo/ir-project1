<headline>French National Assembly approves immigration bill.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-02-27</dateline>

<p>The French National Assembly approved on Thursday a hotly disputed immigration reform bill on a vote of 113 to 61, sending the bill on to the Senate for a final reading beginning on March 11.</p>
<p>The bill passed over the opposition of French leftist deputies, who urged the centre-right government to withdraw it after artists and intellectuals launched petition drives and took to the streets to denounce the measure in a series of protest marches.  </p>
<p>A protest on Saturday drew some 100,000 peaceful demonstrators but a protest on Tuesday night turned violent when riot police clashed with marchers throwing rocks at them, injuring 30 police officers.</p>
<p>Groups opposed to the measure, which aims to close loopholes in tough existing laws dating from 1993 and would grant the police extended powers to track immigrants in France, have scheduled another mass protest for Sunday in the French capital.</p>
<p>The government says the measure is needed to crack down on illegal immigration at a time of near-record 12.7 percent unemployment, soaring social welfare costs and growing lawlessness.</p>
<p>But opponents say the government is pandering to the growing numbers of voters for the extreme-right National Front with an eye on general elections in 1998. They say the measure would foster racism and xenophobia in France.</p>
