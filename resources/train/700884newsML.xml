<p>Britain's Freemasons, a secretive men's organisation, are trying to shake off their image of strange rituals and secret handshakes by launching a &quot;funky&quot; lifestyle magazine this week.</p>
<p>Freemasons are often criticised as a group of middle-aged, middle-class men helping each other up the corporate ladder. Traditionally their activities and rituals have been shrouded in secrecy, but the magazine is intended to open up the Masons to a wider audience.</p>
<p>&quot;Freemasonry Today is a general interest magazine with a pretty funky design which is aimed not just at Freemasons but also the general public,&quot; Toby Churton, its editor, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The magazine includes news of Freemason activities around the world. The first issue carries features on the late rock star Jimi Hendrix and on famous Freemasons such as Winston Churchill and Mozart.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been designed by a group of young designers who normally produce flyers for raves (concert promotions) and do album covers. They are not Masons,&quot; said Churton.</p>
<p>The quarterly magazine will initially be available only on subscription. But Churton said: &quot;We want to get it onto newsagents' shelves early next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Churton said the magazine is intended to make Freemasonry more open and to dispel some of the negative perceptions that the public may hold about the organisation.</p>
<p>The Freemasons have also opened the Freemasons' Hall in central London to the public, and it is listed with the tourist board as an attraction.</p>
<p>Freemasonry began in the 17th century, although some masons say its roots go back to ancient Egypt. Its popularity spread with the British Empire. There are currently an estimated 4.5 million Freemasons worldwide.</p>
