<p>Indonesia's ousted minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri urged party members and supporters on Thursday not to participate in the general election campaign that begins on Sunday.</p>
<p>But Megawati, who lost control of the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to a government-backed rival last year, avoided calling for an illegal boycott of the May 29 polls.</p>
<p>The political temperature has risen ahead of the campaign, with clashes continuing in populous Central Java province between supporters of the Moslem-orientated United Development Party (PPP) and the ruling Golkar.</p>
<p>Megawati said in her statement that she and her supporters had tried to take part in the formal election process but had been blocked by the state-run General Election Institute (LPU), which oversees the elections.</p>
<p>The LPU rejected her list of election candidates for the 500-seat House of Assembly and said it only recognised those of her rival, new PDI leader Surjadi.</p>
<p>&quot;As such, I say to all party members and PDI supporters throughout Indonesia that we will not take part in any campaign activities in the name of the PDI during the 1997 election campaign,&quot; Megawati said her statement.</p>
<p>Her rival Surjadi told a news conference on Thursday that he was in control of the PDI.</p>
<p>&quot;So we don't have to be affected or maybe pay attention to such a statement. If there is someone who claims to be a PDI leader and does not vote for the PDI, that's funny,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Only the ruling Golkar, the PDI and the PPP are legally permitted to contest the election. In the last poll in 1992, Golkar won 68 percent of the vote, the PPP 17 percent and the PDI 15 percent.</p>
<p>Megawati said she had decided to ask her supporters not to take part in the campaign in part to avoid violence.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a political manifesto written by Megawati and leaked to the media said the country was in decline because of a lack of democracy, widespread corruption and a flawed legal system.</p>
<p>Security forces have pledged to safeguard the election and prevent rivalry that would lead to violence.</p>
<p>Last July, the worst riots in Jakarta in more than 20 years broke out when hundreds of supporters of Surjadi, backed by police and troops, attacked PDI headquarters to evict Megawati supporters occupying the building.</p>
<p>At least five people died in the riots, several buildings were burnt and dozens of vehicles destroyed.</p>
<p>The government has banned street marches and rallies during the campaign and has organised a system of campaign zones in an effort to prevent violence.</p>
<p>At another meeting on Thursday, Golkar's general chairman, Information Minister Harmoko, told around 500 election campaigners, including two of President Suharto's children, that he hoped the election would be free of incidents.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the election to be safe, orderly and smooth,&quot; he said at a briefing at party headquarters in Jakarta when campaigners were given seven booklets outlining Golkar's platform.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to remind you again that during the election campaign you should not make promises we cannot keep,&quot; he said.</p>
