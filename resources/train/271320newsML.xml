<p>China has vowed to crack down on wayward law enforcers who lie, cheat, steal, take hostages and even kill to protect their interests, state media on Friday quoted the Supreme Court President Ren Jianxin as saying.</p>
<p>Widespread local and departmental protectionism in law enforcement agencies was weakening government authority and tarnishing the image of the nation's judicial organisations, the official People's Daily quoted Ren as saying.</p>
<p>China would launch a crackdown on such protectionism in the first half of 1997, Ren told a national conference on law enforcement in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;This problem has become so grave that it has already reached the time when we have to make up our minds to overcome it resolutely,&quot; the Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Some law enforcement bodies and personnel have taken advantage of legal loopholes, intentionally misinterpreted the law, distorted evidence, and broken the law they enforce,&quot; said Ren, who is also a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;Law enforcement personnel from elsewhere may even come under attack from local law enforcement workers, or be beaten, arrested, cruelly injured or killed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Punishments for wayward law enforcers should be stiffened to counter their widespread refusal to carry out judgements and a habit of taking hostages to demand repayment of debts, Ren told the conference.</p>
<p>Many Chinese say that the informal devolution of power to local authorities that has come with Beijing's abandonment of traditional communist social and economic controls has allowed many officials to abuse their influence for personal gain.</p>
<p>Beijing has repeatedly launched campaigns to curb abuses of power by local officials, but has found local judicial agencies often have little enthusiasm for the task of enforcement.</p>
<p>A national clean-up drive of judicial agencies should start immediately, and a responsibility system for the handling of legal cases should be developed, Xinhua quoted Ren as saying.</p>
<p>Tight rules should be drawn up to govern all the steps of case registration, trial, mediation, judgements and enforcement, with supervisory mechanisms strengthened, he said.</p>
