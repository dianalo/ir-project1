<p>Turkey's prime minister-designate Mesut Yilmaz was to ask President Suleyman Demirel to approve his planned anti-Islamist government on Monday, an aide to Yilmaz said.</p>
<p>&quot;He is going to the palace to present the cabinet list,&quot; the aide told Reuters. Yilmaz was to meet Demirel at 1200 (0900 GMT).</p>
<p>Yilmaz, the main opposition leader, says Demirel has told him he will approve the government, set up to prevent the Islamists of outgoing caretaker Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan from returning to power.</p>
<p>Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, resigned two weeks ago under pressure from the secularist army.</p>
<p>Stocks in Istanbul rose more than five percent in late morning trading on hopes that Yilmaz would establish a solid government.</p>
<p>The planned government is a minority coalition of three parties that is supported by a fourth parliamentary grouping.</p>
<p>Under Turkish law, the president must approve a new government before it goes to a confidence vote within 10 days.</p>
<p>Another conservative MP from the True Path Party resigned on Monday, further lifting Yilmaz's chances of winning the confidence vote.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said Yilmaz would make an announcement in parliament after meeting Demirel.</p>
