<p>South Africa needs to improve its treatment of tuberculosis (TB) or face a quadrupling of sufferers over the next 10 years, the Department of Health said on Thursday.</p>
<p>TB is one of humanity's oldest and most prevalent killer bugs and is particularly common in developing countries. In South Africa TB kills 10,000 people every year.</p>
<p>&quot;If treatment programmes are not improved now, the number of annual TB cases will quadruple over the next 10 years,&quot; said Doctor Refiloe Matji, manager of South Africa's National TB Control Programme.</p>
<p>Currently in South Africa there are 362 new cases of TB a year per 100,000 people, compared to a world average of 200.</p>
<p>The country, with its sprawling shanty towns, has some of the most concentrated zones of TB infection in the world. The Ravensmead and Uitsig communities in the Western Cape have infection rates of 1,500 per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Matji was speaking at the launch of the government's first full report on TB, released for World TB Day on Monday.</p>
<p>The report calls for the nationwide adoption of a planned anti-TB strategy called DOTS -- Directly Observed Short Course.</p>
<p>TB is 100 percent curable, but because treatment lasts six months many sufferers stop taking their pills as soon as the symptoms end, not realising they are still infected and can spread the disease to others.</p>
<p>This has also given birth to a new breed of deadlier multi-drug resistant TB as strains become immune to treatments.</p>
<p>DOTS is a strictly managed heatlh care system, endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), that monitors patients taking their drugs to ensure they are fully cured, do not spread the disease or help develop multi-drug resistant TB.</p>
<p>In South Africa the TB problem has been particularly acute due to the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus that ravages a patient's immune system, leaving it open to a TB attack. Doctors say DOTS also means more effective treatment for these patients.</p>
<p>The Health Department aims to have DOTS covering the whole country by the year 2000. This should up cure rates from the current level of 50 percent to at least 85 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;With DOTS you prevent multi-drug resistant TB, you cure TB patients the first time around, you treat TB effectively in HIV-positive people and you prevent the spread of TB to the community,&quot; Matji said.</p>
<p>In a global report last year WHO said TB would kill 30 million people worldwide over the next 10 years, unless WHO guidelines and the DOTS strategy are effectively adopted.</p>
<p>In 1995 three million people died at the hands of the disease -- more than during the peaks of epidemics in the late 19th century long before modern treatments were developed.</p>
