<p>Poor countries resisting attempts by rich countries to link trade issues to working conditions have barred the head of the International Labour Organisation from addressing key trade talks, diplomats said on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Monday, ILO (International Labour Organisation) director-general Michel Hansenne was invited to address next week's talks in Singapore and had been expected to argue for a firmer link between trade and labour conditions.</p>
<p>But developing countries fiercely opposed to a WTO &quot;social clause&quot; -- including India, Pakistan, Egypt and Malaysia -- complained and the invitation was withdrawn the next day.</p>
<p>&quot;There was stupor at the ILO,&quot; a diplomatic source said.</p>
<p>The contentious issue of labour standards has been placed on the global agenda by the United States, with backing from some European partners, in a bid to win WTO recognition of basic workers' rights -- despite Asian cries of protectionism.</p>
<p>The undiplomatic &quot;slap in the face&quot; has strained relations between the oldest United Nations agency and the more heavyweight World Trade Organisation (WTO), diplomats said.</p>
<p>&quot;An invitation to attend and speak was received and then withdrawn the next day,&quot; an ILO official said, declining to give details. &quot;If he goes to Singapore, it is to speak,&quot; he said, adding that two high-level ILO officials would still attend.</p>
<p>Hansenne, a former Belgian Minister of Social Affairs, has called for parallel commitments to labour standards and trade liberalisation. But he has rejected coercive legislation or what he calls &quot;a single-minded insistence on trade sanctions&quot;.</p>
<p>Diplomats said that the oral invitation was personally delivered to Hansenne by Swiss trade ambassador William Rossier, who heads the WTO's ruling General Council of 127 member states.</p>
<p>The Swiss envoy who brought the message to the ILO's headquarters was forced to orally retract it in a telephone conversation the next day, according to diplomats.</p>
<p>Unlike other international agencies such as the World Bank, and International Monetary Fund, the 174-member state ILO does not enjoy observer status at the WTO. Such status brings the right to take the floor and address envoys.</p>
<p>But under the procedures of the two-year-old trade watchdog, there is scope for extending such invitations through the head of the General Council or through the host minister.</p>
<p>A WTO spokesman put a brave face on the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;The invitation to Mr. Hansenne has always been extended, it is not a question of him being disinvited. It is not about the invitation -- it is about whether he can speak,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The ILO is not an official observer and doesn't get automatic speaking rights,&quot; the WTO spokesman added. &quot;Unfortunately, there was no consensus in the General Council that he could speak...It is a crowded agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>In a report last month, the ILO estimated that 250 million children between the ages of five and 14 were working in agriculture, mining and factories in the developing world.</p>
<p>Poor nations argue the link between trade and labour standards is best handled in the ILO, founded in 1919 to promote social justice and labour rights. But ILO is limited to pushing states to respect conventions including the one on minimum age.</p>
<p>Some developing countries argue that the West wants working conditions subject to trade rules so as to undermine the poorer countries' advantage from lower wage costs.</p>
<p>The United States is pushing for ministers to talk about the relationship between core labour standards and trade to show U.S. workers -- increasingly fearful that free trade means fewer jobs for them -- that the WTO is alive to their concerns.</p>
<p>Some EU members -- especially France -- agree with the United States that talks on the labour link should begin in the WTO. Others -- Britain, Germany and Spain -- are opposed.</p>
