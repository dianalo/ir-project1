<p>Indonesian palm olein prices were mostly steady in late trading on Tuesday, with buying interest waning on sharp declines in Malaysia, traders said.</p>
<p>They said palm olein was quoted at 1,400 rupiah in Jakarta, unchanged from the opening, but offers were also heard at 10 rupiah above and below the range. Crude palm oil was done at 1,180 rupiah/kg at a 500-tonne tender in Medan. The price was said to be 12 rupiah above the second-best bid.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand slowed down in the afternoon because of the sharp falls in Malaysia,&quot; one trader said, adding that Malaysian values were adjusting to Indonesian prices following Indonesia's implementation of new export taxes for crude palm oil and its products from July.</p>
<p>&quot;Indonesian exports of palm olein are going to be more competitive because of the lower tax rates,&quot; he said. &quot;Malaysian prices have to adjust down to remain competitive.&quot;</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Monday the export tax on crude palm oil was five percent, that on palm olein two percent, palm oil four percent and crude olein four percent.</p>
<p>He said the taxes on crude palm oil and its products averaged 10-12 percent between 1994 and last year.</p>
<p>A finance ministry official said on Tuesday the taxes were effective from July 1 and would be based on the free-on-board price on the day the importer opens the letter of credit.</p>
<p>He said the industry and trade ministry would in future issue the export price periodically.</p>
