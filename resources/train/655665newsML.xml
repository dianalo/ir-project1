<title>HUNGARY: BUDAPEST GRAINS FUTURES MARKET TRENDLESS.</title>
<headline>BUDAPEST GRAINS FUTURES MARKET TRENDLESS.</headline>

<p>Grains futures of the Budapest Commodity Exchange remained trendless on Thursday on a lack of domestic or international market-moving factors, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Chicago gave no guidance to wheat prices...and maize prices will only move significantly around harvesting time,&quot; said Janos Szolyka of Swap.</p>
<p>July milling wheat was the only maturity to show significant price movement, dropping 290 forints per tonne to 22,010 forints, but the volume was a modest 39 lots.</p>
<p>August milling wheat saw more deals with 215 lots but it only moved down 10 forints to 22,300.</p>
<p>Szolyka said milling wheat prices were locked in a range of 22,000 to 23,000 forints.</p>
<p>&quot;Crop outlooks are very good...but a psychological barrier would prevent prices plummeting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maize futures prices were unchanged for all but December which rose 100 forints to 20,500 but only 10 lots changed hands.</p>
<p>The only other traded maize maturity was July, but Szolyka said there was actual delivery behind the single 200-lots deal at Wednesday's settlement price.</p>
<p>&quot;Most players already closed their (speculative) positions so everybody is waiting for someone else to move,&quot; he said, adding that the spot market and the futures market were also looking at each other for a lead.</p>
<p>&quot;Spot market prices, however, are somewhat lower at the moment, so it could be worth selling on the futures market if one can finance it,&quot; Szolyka said.</p>
<p>Total grains futures turnover was a modest 696 lots or 311.5 million forints, down from Wednesday's 1,258 lots or 547.75 million forints.</p>
<p>(Lot size=20,000 kgs $=184.70 Hungarian forints)</p>
