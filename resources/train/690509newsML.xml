<p>Dutch shares closed mixed to lower on Thursday with early gains eroded by profit-taking, although a late spike higher on the back of a firmer Wall Street opening helped bring prices above the session's low.</p>
<p>The AEX share index ended 0.83 points below Wednesday's record high close to finish Thursday at 870.63. Early gains continuing Wednesday's record-breaking rise pushed the AEX up briefly to a new intra-day high of 875.61.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going through a choppy phase at the moment, the index could either back-track to 850 or go on up to 900, either looks possible although I think it looks overbought,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>Thursday's early advances were concentrated in a handful of big-gaining blue-chips, such as Royal Dutch, Akzo and Philips which all finished with their gains pared.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from a few special situations there's not that much that's new in the market,&quot; said another dealer, noting that retail investors had pushed prices ahead in early dealings before institutions started taking profits.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the short to medium term trends point to the 34 percent rise in the AEX index so far in 1997 continuing, with 900 points in a couple of weeks seen as a staging post to a year-end destination of as high as 1,000 points.</p>
<p>&quot;For the short term I think the market will go higher but for the medium term a lot depends on what the U.S. does about interest rates,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>U.S. rates could come under upward pressure as authorities move to damp down wage inflation if jobs figures continue to show falling unemployment, he said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said his clients were telling him they were beginning to become sceptical of the room for more gains. &quot;It's not that they plan to sell off, it's just that they're not looking to buy,&quot; he said, adding they could become aggressive buyers if the AEX corrected down to 815-820.</p>
