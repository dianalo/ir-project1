<p>Britain's Save the Children Fund (SCF), in a report launched on Thursday, recommended gradual elimination of child labour from Pakistan's soccer ball industry, saying an immediate ban would cause hardship.</p>
<p>The report, presented by SCF's international programme director Carolyn Miller, said the vast majority of children stitching soccer balls in the industrial Sialkot area were poor.</p>
<p>&quot;The hasty withdrawal of children from stitching, will present a serious threat to their wellbeing...and may result in them taking up more dangerous forms of work, such as surgical instruments manufacture,&quot; the charity's report said.</p>
<p>Last month the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the U.N. Children's Fund and the Pakistani government launched a plan to eliminate child labour from the soccer ball industry, estimated to employ at least 7,000 children, in two years.</p>
<p>Under an agreement reached in the U.S. city of Atlanta in February 1996, multinational companies, suppliers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the International Federation of Football Associations decided to try to phase out child labour in Sialkot by the end of 1998.</p>
<p>Sialkot, the centre of Pakistan's sports goods industry, produces two-thirds of the world's hand-stitched soccer balls for an export market worth $1 billion a year in retail sales, the ILO says.</p>
<p>It says 22 major soccer ball manufacturers, producing about 80 percent of balls exported from Pakistan, had agreed to take part in the project under which manufacturers will set up stitching units that will have no employees aged under 14.</p>
<p>At present, most manufacturing of soccer balls is outsourced and delegated to sub-contractors who take the raw material to village households where it is not possible to monitor whether children are helping to make the balls.</p>
<p>The SCF report stressed that social protection programmes were needed to support children excluded from work.</p>
<p>&quot;The first 18 months of the programme will not result in the adequate social protection of all children involved in the industry, and to become broadly effective the programme will need at least five years,&quot; it recommended.</p>
<p>The report said its survey had found that 81 percent of the children stitch soccer balls to help their families meet basic needs for food and clothes. &quot;Stopping children from stitching balls will significantly reduce family income,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said stitching soccer balls does not prevent children from attending school, though only 20 percent of child stitchers go to school and about 58 percent had received some education.</p>
<p>&quot;They work because their families need the income, and cannot afford to send them to school.&quot;</p>
<p>The SCF report said that unlike the manufacture of surgical instruments and brick-making, football stitching does not involve exposure to heat, sharp tools, toxic substances or dusty particles that can cause respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>&quot;It is therefore perceived as a better option than these other forms of work,&quot; it said, but added that prolonged stitching from a young age can cause damage to finger joints, back pain, headaches and eye strain.</p>
<p>Pakistan exported about 20 million soccer balls worth 1.265 billion rupees ($31 million) in 1995/96 (July-June).</p>
