<p>The United States may reinstate subsidies to agricultural exports if the European Union decides to support its own farm produce, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We reserve the right to utilise the authority that we have under our law. But I would prefer the U.S and the rest of the world not get into this trap of subsidising exports because once you go down that road, it becomes a never ending battle as to who can subsidise the most,&quot; Glickman told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>In the past few months when world wheat stocks touched their lowest levels since World War II, wheat-producing countries did not need to subsidise exports as most stocks were retained for domestic consumption.</p>
<p>But with better harvests and stocks rising, the trade battle over grains has hotted up again.</p>
<p>Glickman described this year's U.S. wheat crop as average, saying: &quot;We are in better shape. The wheat market is still tight but not as tight as last year.&quot;</p>
<p>Glickman said the EU had sent mixed signals on whether it would support farmers from its member countries.</p>
<p>&quot;All I am saying is I hope they don't do it. But if they do, then we will have to respond accordingly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Glickman is in Manila for the annual meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and there were indications the United States would take a tough line on its trade disputes.</p>
<p>Asked about problems with China over U.S. grains exports, Glickman hinted the United States would continue to oppose its entry into the World Trade Organisation unless it changed its stance.</p>
<p>&quot;China can't come into the WTO, be a part of nations economically and still call it its own way when it comes to agricultural import export practices,&quot; Glickman said.</p>
<p>In recent months, China has rejected consignments of U.S. wheat, saying they were disease-infected. But commodities experts say the cargo may have been rejected because China had a good harvest.</p>
<p>U.S. comodities firms are likely to go on selling aggressively in the world grains markets next year as stocks rise rapidly. The corn output this year will be the third largest in history, Glickman said. He described the soybean and oilseeds crop as &quot;very good.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. would not like to subsidise its farm produce, Glickman said, but added: &quot;I would say that our judgement on this would depend on what the European Union does.&quot;</p>
