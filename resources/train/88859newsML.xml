<p>Top global finance officials are expected to congratulate each other on the improving world economy but warn against complacency at the opening plenary session of the IMF/World Bank annual meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The gathering, which brings together the economic elite from 181 countries, follows several days of intense discussions that culminated in the launch on Monday of a multi-billion dollar debt relief program for their very poorest members.</p>
<p>The initiative, which was endorsed by the joint Development Committee of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, aims to lift the burden on countries that must spend the benefits of economic growth servicing their debts.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a breakthrough,&quot; World Bank President James Wolfensohn told reporters on Monday. &quot;It was very good news for the poor of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The time is ripe for launching such a program because the world economy is looking up. The IMF has forecast that global economic growth will speed up to 4.1 percent next year, from 3.8 percent this year.</p>
<p>Even in poverty-stricken Africa, the outlook has improved. IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said the continent's economy is expanding at a five percent annual rate, thanks to painful actions to put their finances in shape.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a new upwards trend that is likely to continue as long as the reform programs hold steady,&quot; he told a news conference on Monday.</p>
<p>Russia and Mexico, two countries whose problems have dominated past annual meetings, seem on the mend, helped by huge sums of money from the IMF.</p>
<p>Even the pesky currency markets have cooperated. Led by the United States, rich industrial nations have insisted they want a strong dollar and the markets responded in kind on Monday, pushing the U.S. currency up.</p>
<p>But that is not to say that no problems exist. Many parts of the world are still beset by wrenching poverty.</p>
<p>&quot;While some general conditions are favorable, fundamental development challenges remain,&quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said. &quot;We must focus increased attention to working with countries and regions where growth has lagged and where millions remain trapped in poverty.&quot;</p>
<p>The wealthy industrial countries have their problems too. Europe is racked by sky-high unemployment and its recovery is fragile at best.</p>
<p>After years of being mired in a near-recession, Japan's economy has shown some signs of revival, but the risk of a relapse remains.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy looks healthy, but there are some worries that long-dormant inflation may be about to pick up after 5-1/2 years of growth.</p>
