<p>The head of Turkey's powerful military has warned Islamists against trying to water down the country's strict secularist system, Anatolian news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal is to change the secularist, democratic system and drag the country into the darkness of the Middle Ages,&quot; the state-run agency quoted General Ismail Hakki Karadayi as telling a magazine for Turks living in Western Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;This cannot be accepted by the Turkish people and their armed forces,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, NATO member Turkey's first Islamist prime minister, has generally avoided upsetting the staunchly secularist military since he came to power in June.</p>
<p>But some members of his Welfare Party have publicly called for introducing more Moslem practices into public life. The Welfare-run justice ministry is trying to lift a ban on women civil servants wearing Islamic headscarves to work.</p>
<p>Political analysts say the military is uncomfortable at Erbakan's efforts to have closer cooperation with Moslem countries and possible defence industry cooperation with Iran.</p>
