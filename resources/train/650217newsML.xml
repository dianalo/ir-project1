<text>
<p>Four companies have filed a lawsuit against Archer Daniels Midland Co and other producers of citric acid, seeking triple damages for allegedly paying prices that were inflated by an antitrust scheme.</p>
<p>The suit was filed on Monday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by Procter &amp; Gamble Co ; Kraft Foods Inc, a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc ; Quaker Oats Co and Schreiber Foods Inc.</p>
<p>The defendants in the suit, including ADM, have previously agreed to pay criminal fines in a U.S. antitrust probe.</p>
<p>ADM declined to comment on the suit.  </p>
<p>Besides ADM, defendants named in the suit are Haarman &amp; Reimer Corp, a subsidiary of Bayer AG ; Hoffman-LaRoche Inc and F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd, which are part of Roche Holding Ltd ; SA Citrique Belge NV, and Jungbunzlauer Inc and Jungbunzlauer International AG of Switzerland.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed by the four companies who previously opted out of a civil class action suit settlement. As part of that settlement, ADM agreed to pay $35 million to settle citric acid price litigation.  </p>
<p>In court documents, the plaintiffs said their suit arises out of a &quot;massive and long-running international conspiracy&quot; to &quot;fix, raise and stabilize prices, allocate market share, and commit other unlawful practices designed artificially to inflate the prices of citric acid.&quot;</p>
<p>The plaintiffs said they are among the largest U.S. purchasers of citric acid, an additive that is made from fermented corn. The companies said that, for the period from 1991 through 1995, they bought more than $350 million worth of citric acid from the defendants and other suppliers.  </p>
<p>Because of the alleged price-fixing scheme, the plaintiffs said they paid more for the product than they otherwise would have paid. As a result, they said, they suffered an undetermined amount of damages.</p>
<p>Last year, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of citric acid and lysine, a feed additive, and agreed to pay $100 million in fines to the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p>In addition, Hoffman-LaRoche agreed to pay $14 million in U.S. criminal fines, Jungbunzlauer agreed to $11 million, and Haarman &amp; Reimer agreed to $50 million in fines.</p>
<p>Citric acid, a $1.2 billion worldwide market, is used in soft drinks, processed foods, detergents, textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.</p>
