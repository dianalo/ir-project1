<headline>Comcast Reports third-quarter loss of $10 million.</headline>
<dateline>PHILADELPHIA 1996-11-04</dateline>

<p>Comcast Corp., the cable television and cellular phone company, said Monday it lost $10 million in the third quarter due to financing costs and non-cash charges, principally from acquisitions.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based company, which is the majority owner of home shopping network QVC, said the loss equalled 4 cents per share. This compared with a net loss of $7.4 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago.</p>
<p>Revenues rose 12 percent to $975 million from $870 million a year earlier. The company said its operating cash flow also rose 12 percent to $296 million.</p>
<p>Comcast said its cable division reported a 6.6 percent rise in revenue, while its cellular division reported a 12.5 percent increase in revenues.</p>
<p>QVC reported third quarter revenue growth of 10 percent, despite competition for viewers from the Summer Olympics. Comcast became a principal owned of QVC in February, 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;As we gear up for an active fourth quarter we are enthusiastic about the prospects of each of our core businesses,&quot; Comcast President Brian Roberts said in a statement. &quot;In particular, the cable division is continuing to aggressively upgrade its network infrastructure and customer service platforms to provide a broader and richer array of programming to our customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Comcast also has a majority stake in a partnership grouping the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team, and two sports arenas.</p>
<p>For the first nine months, the company said it lost $28 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $2.87 billion. A year earlier, the company posted a loss of $32.2 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $2.36 billion.</p>
