<p>China's former de facto embassy in Hong Kong, a branch of the official Xinhua news agency, plans to revamp its leadership, a newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A month after the former British colony returned to Chinese rule on July 1, the South China Morning Post said three of Xinhua's six deputy directors -- Qin Wenjun, 65, Zhang Junsheng, 60, and Ulanmulun, 61 -- were due to step down.</p>
<p>The phasing out of the three officials was expected to take up to six months, it said. Zou Zhekai, head of the co-ordination department, was likely to replace Qin, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Xinhua officials were not available to comment. The agency has played a watchdog role for the Chinese government in Hong Kong and has served as the local branch of the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Its future role is unclear.</p>
