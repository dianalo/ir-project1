<p>MUNICH, Germany - German luxury automaker BMW, which had one of the most successful years in its history in 1996, warned Tuesday that its sales growth was about to slow.</p>
<p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder told the company's annual news conference that sluggish global markets and limited capacity at BMW plants left little room for the company to improve on its 13.3 percent sales growth last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very confident about 1997,&quot; Pischetsrieder said. &quot;But we will not see the same order of magnitude of sales growth this year.&quot;</p>
<p>BMW sales, fuelled by the hot-selling 5-Series executive class sedan and the Z3 sports car, appeared to start 1997 in high gear, climbing 22 percent to 14 billion marks ($8.3 billion).</p>
<p>But the company said a combination of factors and a one-time charge will dampen growth as the year goes on.</p>
<p>The world's major car markets face a difficult year in 1997, BMW said. Tax advantages that fuelled demand for new cars in some European countries have been abolished and slow real income growth has left consumers with less money for BMW's luxury cars.</p>
<p>Markets in the United States and Japan, two of the most important for BMW, are expected to stagnate, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;After the strong growth of 1996, BMW sales are likely to stabilise at the current high level,&quot; BMW said.</p>
<p>Pischetsrieder added that even if demand was better than expected, the company would have little room to increase production because its plants are already running near capacity.</p>
<p>A sharp increase in first-quarter sales this year, meanwhile, should not be taken at face value.</p>
<p>The BMW chairman said much of the gain was due to the fact that the company's two new models were not available in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to consider the base effect of the engine and model changeovers at the beginning of last year,&quot; Pischetsrieder said. &quot;The growth rates are very high at the moment, but are expected to diminish, in percent terms, in coming months.&quot;</p>
<p>Another question mark hanging over BMW sales this year is the timing of the launch of a new 3-Series model -- BMW's backbone car, accounting for about two-thirds of BMW brand sales.</p>
<p>Car industry analysts expect demand for the car, introduced in 1991, to slow this year as consumers hold off buying a new car until they can have the latest offering from Munich.</p>
<p>Pressed about the launch of the new model, BMW executives would say only that it would not be introduced this year and that the company historically only changes models about every seven to eight years.</p>
<p>Pischetsrieder generally refused to provide a specific sales forecast for 1997, but when asked by a reporter if 60 billion marks ($35.59 billion) was possible, he simply answered &quot;yes.&quot; Company sales in 1996 were worth 52.27 billion marks ($31 billion).</p>
