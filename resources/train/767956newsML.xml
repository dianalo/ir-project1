<headline>Austrian bonds end higher, seen upbeat.</headline>
<text>
<p>VIENNA, July 30 (Reuter) Austrian bonds ended firmer on Wednesday but off the day's highs after the market came under pressure from profit taking.</p>
<p>U.S. inflation data gave the market a boost, traders said, noting interest concentrated on the long end.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures were expected. There was nothing much else driving the market today,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Dealers said a rumour that Austria might issue a Eurobond worth $500 million was causing short-term jitters. The Federal Financing Agency has denied the rumour.</p>
<p>Traders predicted the mood would be positive if slightly restrained ahead of a rash of U.S. data due to be released in the next few days.</p>
