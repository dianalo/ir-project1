<p>British drugs giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc on Friday set out the stall of goods which it hopes will keep it at the forefront of the world pharmaceuticals industry.</p>
<p>In an upbeat review of its research and development pipeline, the company said it was on target to meet its dual goal of producing double-digit sales growth by 1999 after two lean years and putting three major new products on the market every year from the turn of the century.</p>
<p>The ambitious project is essential if Glaxo Wellcome is to make up for the loss of Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which topped world sales leagues for eleven years in a row and lifted Glaxo from being a modest British player to the world's number one drug company.</p>
<p>The drop in Zantac sales in the face of patent expires has already pushed Glaxo into second place in terms of global market share, behind Switzerland's Novartis AG, and the slippage in sales is likely to become an avalanche when Zantac loses U.S. protection in July.</p>
<p>The demise of Zantac was a major factor behind Glaxo's decision in 1995 to pounce on rival Wellcome, which it bought for just over 9 billion pounds, with cost-cutting filling the gap left by falling sales until new products could take over.</p>
<p>But analysts have become increasingly confident that Glaxo Wellcome will pull off a similar trick to its rival SmithKline Beecham Plc, which was able to overcome the decline of its best-selling drug, Tagamet, with new products.</p>
<p>Although shares in Glaxo Wellcome slipped back after the update, trading down 14 1/2 pence at 1180 1/2, traders said analysts were still locked in with the company poring over the details of the announcement.</p>
<p>The group's share have had a strong run recently, briefly pushing through the 12 stg barrier last week. However it remains on a lower valuation than its British peers, SmithKline and Zeneca Group Plc, trading on a current price/earnings ratio of 21.08 compared with 27.37 for Zeneca and 22.69 for SmithKline according to Reuters 3000 data.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock's had a very good run recently and while the R&amp;D came up to expectations it's still been marked lower with the uncertainty after the (British) election,&quot; a market maker with a UK bank said.</p>
<p>Glaxo Wellcome chief executive Richard Sykes said on Friday &quot;the quality, depth and diversity of our pipeline supports our view that Glaxo Wellcome is without equal in its commitment to finding new medicines through leading-edge science.&quot;</p>
<p>Glaxo Wellcome said it expected to put more than 20 drug molecules into development this year alone.</p>
<p>It also announced plans to seek approval for a new combined version of two of its most successful asthma drugs, Serevent and Flixotide, next year.</p>
<p>In a move to cement its dominance of the AIDS/HIV market, Glaxo said it had two new drugs under development and would also seek approval for a tablet combining Retrovir and Epivir, the two products which are the cornerstone of new cocktails of drugs that have revolutionised treatment of the disease.</p>
<p>Other areas covered by the group included new anti-biotics which can overcome resistance to existing therapies, treatment for the most common form of diabetes and products to tackle two widespread but poorly treated conditions, irritable bowel syndrome and enlarged prostate, a condition which affects one in two men over 50.</p>
