<title>USA: Most IMM currency futures end higher before FOMC.</title>

<p>Most IMM currency futures ended pit trading higher as the market contemplates Tuesday's and Wednesday's U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.</p>
<p>Turnover picked up again during the final 30 minutes, with one dealer seen buying March marks and selling Swiss francs, while a second dealer bought both marks and Swiss francs.</p>
<p>&quot;They were positioning for FOMC,&quot; said a floor broker of the otherwise light afternoon activity.</p>
<p>He echoed comments by other brokers, who said few looked for the Fed to change U.S. rates, especially after recent U.S. data showed inflation last quarter remained controlled.  </p>
<p>&quot;The FOMC's not going to do anything with rates,&quot; said another broker. &quot;They don't have to.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted that futures rose briefly, with Swiss francs popping up to the day's high, after financier George Soros said the dollar's rate of change rather than its level could be a concern for Group of Seven ministers, who will meet Saturday in Berlin.</p>
<p>Some, however, expressed skepticism about the Swiss franc's rise being attributed mainly to Soros' comments.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was just a little spook (caused) by Soros,&quot; he said, noting nagging leeriness about potential intervention.  </p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is going to assume he's (Soros) selling dollars and buying Swiss,&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>Comments by U.S. Treasury Robert Rubin added only minor weight, they said. Rubin said the Clinton administration's dollar policy is unchanged. Rubin often has repeated the administration's stance that it favors a strong dolar.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the 15th time he's said we're happy with a stronger dollar,&quot; quipped the first broker.</p>
<p>The yen cut losses incurred overnight after Japanese prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said the dollar is unlikely to be lowered through international cooperation.  </p>
<p>At settlement, yen lost $0.000020 to $0.008261, marks eased $0.0011 to $0.6112, Swiss francs rose $0.0023 to $0.7079, sterling jumped $0.0138 to $1.6116, Canadian dollar rose $0.0020 to $0.7464, Aussie dollar rose $0.0020 to $0.7645, Mexican peso rose $0.000225 to $0.125325.</p>
