<headline>Scottish poll shows slight Conservative gain.</headline>

<p>Britain's ruling Conservative Party's is showing signs of clawing back some support in Scotland, but the opposition Labour Party still has a commanding position, an opinion poll published on Monday showed.</p>
<p>The ICM telephone poll of 1,002 adults between last Tuesday and Friday, conducted for Scottish Television and The Scotsman newspaper, put Labour ahead with 45 support, the Scottish National Party second with 23 percent and the Conservatives with 19 percent.</p>
<p>A poll earlier this month gave the Conservatives 16 percent support, but pollsters System Three which carried out that survey said it had changed the wording of the questions slightly so that people would not be embarrassed at supporting an unpopular party. It gave Labour 50 percent, the SNP 22 and the Liberal Democrats one.</p>
<p>On Sunday an NOP poll across Britain showed support for Labour at 49 percent compared with 32 percent for the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Conservatives now have 10 of Scotland's 72 seats in the 651-seat House of Commons (lower house of national parliament). Labour has 49, the Liberal Democrats nine  and SNP four. Prime Minister John Major must call a general election by May 22.</p>
<p>John Curtice, an election expert at Strathclyde University, told the Scotsman that if the voting patterns were repeated in the election the Conservatives would hold just six seats.</p>
