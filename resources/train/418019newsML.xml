<p>Asarco Inc said Tuesday that operations of its unit Southern Peru Copper Corp have been disrupted because of heavy rains and flooding in southedrn Peru.</p>
<p>It said Southern Peru operates the Toquepala and Cuajone mines and a smalter and refiner at Ilo, all located in southern Peru.</p>
<p>During the months of January through March, Peru's southern region had experienced significant rainfall, it said.  </p>
<p>Since the afternoon of March 3, operations at both mines and the smelter have been curtailed, it said.</p>
<p>Flooding had damaged isolated sections of SPCC's railroad, roadways and tailings system, it said.</p>
<p>Extent of damage to the rail lines and other faiclities is being assessed and the effect on production cannot be determined until that assessment is completed, it said.  </p>
<p>Asarco said no major operating facilities of Southern Peru have been damaged and no employee has been injured due to the flooding. It said Southern Peru carries property damage and business intrerruption insurance.</p>
<p>Southern Peru, in which Asarco owns a 54.1 percent stake, produced 678.1 million lbs of copper, 3.1 million ounces of silver and 8.7 million pounds of molybdenum.</p>
<p>Asarco produces mostly copper, lead, zinc, silver and molbydenum. It also produces specialty chemicals and aggregates.</p>
