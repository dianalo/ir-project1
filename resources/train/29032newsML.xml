<p>Allied Healthcare Products Inc, which reported a fiscal 1996 fourth quarter loss, said its directors voted to suspend payment of the company's quarterly cash dividend.</p>
<p>Allied Healthcare, which makes respiratory therapy equipment, last paid a quarterly dividend of $0.07 a share on July 15, 1996.  </p>
<p>Allied Healthcare reported a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, 1996 of $2.1 million or $0.30 a share compared with a profit of $2.7 million or $0.44 a share in the same period a year ago.  Sales for the fourth quarter fell to $30.2 million from $33.7 million last year.</p>
<p>The company had said at the end of July that its core domestic markets continue to be hurt by consolidation among health care providers and ongoing uncertainty in the marketplace caused by health care reform.</p>
<p>In addition, Allied Healthcare said integration of recent acquisitions has turned out to be more difficult than originally anticipated.  However, these acquisitions are expected to provide good sources of future growth in sales and earnings, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said it has implemented plans to improve operating efficiencies and to reduce costs.  For example, in August, the company said it initiated a restructuring and consolidation of its field sales force, instituted an extensive training program for its field sales force and has upgraded its information systems.</p>
