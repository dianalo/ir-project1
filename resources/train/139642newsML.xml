<p>A flattening move that compressed the Belgian linear bond yield curve by about four basis points on Thursday was likely to continue on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>But dealers saw little chance the move turning into an extended rout of shorter maturities. &quot;It could go another one or two basis points, but I don't believe it will do much more,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The short end of the Belgian yield curve continued to suffer in line with Germany on Thursday in the wake of interest rate comments by Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing.</p>
<p>Issing said on Wednesday a further rate easing was not to be expected nor necessary.</p>
<p>Provisional data on Thursday showing West German inflation in October rose to 1.5 percent from 1.4 percent in September also put pressure on shorter maturities, one trader said.</p>
<p>He said, however, that investors were merely moving their money along the yield curve and not switching out of Belgium.</p>
<p>&quot;Five and six year paper was well offered all day...but OLO 12s and 23s were very well bid,&quot; he said, referring to the eight percent bonds maturing in December 2012 and 2015.</p>
