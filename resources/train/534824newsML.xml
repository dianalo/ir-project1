<title>UK: Lassa fever threatens Sierra Leone capital - doctors.</title>

<p>The worst-ever outbreak of lassa fever, a deadly haemorrhagic disease similar to ebola, is threatening to spread to Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, British aid doctors said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Britain's Medical Emergency Relief International (Merlin) said case numbers in the epidemic had doubled since December.</p>
<p>Refugees fleeing civil war were packing into the town of Kenema and conditions were just right for the spread of the highly virulent disease, the organisation said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the worst outbreak of lassa fever since records began,&quot; said Richard Allen, medical adviser to Merlin.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we are concerned that lassa fever may spread from the bush to the capital city, Freetown. The first suspected case of lassa fever was admitted to a Freetown hospital this week.&quot;</p>
<p>The volunteer medical group said it had flown a lassa specialist nurse, drugs and equipment to Freetown.</p>
<p>Spokesman Jonathan Lorie said there had been 239 cases with 35 deaths so far this year -- compared to 367 cases and 93 deaths for the whole of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;It happens every spring,&quot; he said. &quot;There was an epidemic last summer but it died down in the autumn and the whole thing has built up afresh since January.&quot;</p>
<p>The virus is transmitted through rat's urine or bodily fluids -- including sweat. &quot;You can get it just by shaking hands, if someone infected is sweaty and you have a cut on your hand,&quot; Lorie said.</p>
<p>Last year's outbreak had an unprecedented 60 percent mortality rate -- lassa usually kills about 15 percent of its victims. Lorie said the same vicious strain was probably involved this year but having drugs on hand helped survival.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;Finding the drugs is a real problem because there are only two sources in the world for it.&quot;</p>
<p>Only one drug -- Ribavirin -- can cure lassa. Lorie said Merlin was buying the drug through a wholesaler at a discounted price of five pounds (eight dollars) a dose.</p>
<p>The disease takes its name from Lassa village in northern Nigeria, where it was first recorded in 1969.</p>
<p>Provincial officials fear the Sierra Leone toll could be higher as some afflicted people are in areas cut off by rebels who have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1991.</p>
