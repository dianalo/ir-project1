<p>Police are searching for three masked gunmen who entered a bar in this Southwest Texas border town and shot seven people gangland-style, killing five of them, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears to be a professional job,&quot; police spokesman Bill Pfeil said, adding that investigators were looking into the possibility of a drug or organised crime connection.</p>
<p>Two of the five who were killed were from El Paso -- the bar owner and a guitarist -- and three were from New Mexico, including two horse trainers. All were shot early Saturday with large calibre weapons at close range.</p>
<p>Pfeil said the surviving victims, both of whom remained in the hospital Monday in fair condition, told police three armed men entered the a bar wearing white masks and made everyone empty their pockets before lining them up and shooting them.</p>
<p>&quot;It's under investigation, that's all I can say,&quot; he said.</p>
