<p>A deal giving Dubai-based Dolphin Group commercial control over nature reserves in South Africa's Mpumalanga province has been scaled down after opposition from environmental activists.</p>
<p>Dolphin said in a statement on Thursday it had renegotiated an agreement signed last November with the state's Mpumalanga Parks Board.</p>
<p>The agreement was originally valued at around 12.2 billion rand ($2.7 billion).</p>
<p>The firm said it had agreed to invest 410 million rand in the project over three years and to shorten the contract period to 25 years. The original was to last 50 years.</p>
<p>Two areas, one a nature reserve and the other a historic mining town, are excluded under the new terms negotiated in London by a delegation of South Africans and Dolphin's chief, Ketan Somaia.</p>
<p>The agreement still faces the problem of land claims lodged by black communities living near the reserves who say their territory was taken from them under apartheid.</p>
<p>Dolphin has offered black communities on the borders of the reserves a 20 percent share of the development companies, but has left the politically sensitive claims to be handled by the Mpumalanga Parks Board.</p>
<p>The reserves are in South Africa's Mpumalanga province, also site of the Kruger National Park, a reserve roughly the same size as Israel, but which is excluded from the agreement.</p>
<p>Environmental activists attacked the original deal, which was signed without any public debate. They charged the board with giving too much power to Dolphin and selling off some of the country's jewels.</p>
<p>The Wildlife and Environmental Society of South Africa greeted the revised deal cautiously.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too soon to be unrealistically optimistic,&quot; the society said.</p>
