<p>U.S. credit markets get a stream of indicators on Friday which will likely shed some new light on the state of the country's manufacturing and consumer sectors, Wall Street analysts said.</p>
<p>The trading session will start with the release of the Federal Reserve's industrial production and capacity utilization report for October at 0915 EST/1415 GMT.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the data to confirm a widespread market sentiment that the manufacturing sector is slowing down somewhat into the fourth quarter.  </p>
<p>&quot;Industrial production tomorrow should not be a threat to the market,&quot; said James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Economists in a Reuters poll expect industrial output to be unchanged against a 0.2 percent rise in the previous month. Capacity utilization is expected to be down a notch at 83.0 percent against 83.3 percent in the previous month.</p>
<p>At 1000 EST/1500 GMT, the market will take in business inventories for the month of September. Wall Street pundits expect inventories to rise by 0.2 percent against a 0.5 percent jump in August.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the data will be closely watched this month because the report is likely to clarify some lingering market's doubts about the performance of manufacturing and retail inventories.</p>
<p>Pundits said the market is still confused about how much, if any, inventory overhang companies carried from the third into the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue is whether or not retail inventories come in higher than callers expect it because some of the stuff they thought was in the wholesale area migrated over to retail inventory,&quot; said David Hensley, economist at Salomon Brothers.  </p>
<p>Hensley said the question gained momentum after the latest Gross Domestic Product report hinted the economy had a significant inventory build in the third quarter that could overhang production in the fourth quarter and make industrial output to be soft irrespective of sales.</p>
<p>On the consumer side, the market will take in the University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index for November at 1000 EST/1500 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The Michigan numbers could be interesting because they'll bring some very fresh data to the market,&quot; a money trader at a U.S. investment bank said.  </p>
<p>Analysts said economic data seen so far this month, including retail sales and inflation gauges, suggest American consumers are buying at a faster but still moderate pace in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The market will also take in the policy action record of the September meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC).</p>
<p>On Thursday, the 6-1/2-percent benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was quoted up 13/32 in late trade at 101-1/32. Its yield was at 6.42 percent.  </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system on Thursday via $1.0 billion customer repurchase agreements when the federal funds were trading at 5-1/4 percent.</p>
<p>The funds rate is seen opening at 5.38 percent on Friday, well above the Fed's 5.25 percent target.</p>
