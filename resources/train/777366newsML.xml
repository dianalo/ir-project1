<p>The won closed higher on Monday, reflecting abundant dollar positions in the market, but dealers said the strength of the local currency was limited on fears of central bank's interventions.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was lethargic, trapped in a tight range,&quot; said a foreign bank dealer. &quot;Nobody wants to risk the dollar's upside with ample dollars in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the won's rise was also limited as many hoped the central bank would step in to give a boost in the market.</p>
<p>The won ended at 888.90, compared with Friday's close of 889.30.  </p>
<p>After opening at 889.00, the won fell to the day's low of 889.10 on short-covering and rose to a high of 888.60 on abundant dollars.</p>
<p>Dealers said dollar's strength against the yen in Tokyo had no direct impact in the won/dollar market.</p>
<p>&quot;With no specific market impetus, the dollar will fall slightly further and move around the 888 level,&quot; the foreign bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Tuesday's mid-rate was expected to be fixed at 888.80 against 889.30 today.</p>
