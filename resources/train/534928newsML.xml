<p>North Sea crudes rose slightly on Wednesday in a quiet market which some traders said was propped up by evidence of Brent crude sailing to the U.S.</p>
<p>The June Brent contract traded 10 cents firmer at $18.16 a barrel by 1233 GMT in a follow-through to a rally late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Physical activity was thin but traders said the market drew support from the sale on Wednesday of two Brents due to load May 2-4 and May 6-8 to a trader seen sending a VLCC to the U.S. Gulf. The cargoes fetched June Brent -40 and -45 cents respectively, traders said.</p>
<p>There were also signs that other North Sea grades were strengthening. A Statfjord May 18-20 sold by an equity holder on Wednesday changed hands at Dated Brent +14 or +15 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Two Brent cargoes. loading May 9-11 loading, were due to turn wet on Thursday.</p>
<p>On the paper market, intermonth spreads were slightly firmer with May/June talked at -23/-20 cents and Jun/Jul -13/-11 cents.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs were mixed, April 28-02 trading twice at June Brent -43 cents, one cent over Wednesday's levels, and May 5-9 talked at June Brent -43/-40 cents, a fall of about three cents.</p>
<p>North Sea sentiment was propped up by thinner early May supply with only a couple of offshore loaders still unsold in the first half of May, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's an awful lot (on offer). I think it is getting sold out for the first decade,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Mediterranean sour benchmark Urals held firm, supported by robust margins for high sulphur fuel oil, but signs of lengthening supply and an array of alternatives kept refinery buyers relaxed. &quot;Sellers are still asking high numbers for prompt barrels but I'm sure Urals will start heading back towards (Dated Brent) -$1.20 very soon,&quot; said one.  </p>
<p>Urals was pegged at around Dated Brent -$1.05 a barrel, basis cif Augusta, on Wednesday. Traders asked about Dated Brent -$1.00 for large cargoes loading in the first 10 days of May, but buyers said the offers were at least 10 cents too high.</p>
<p>&quot;With Urals close to (Dated) -$1.00 it's not only Kirkuk which looks better but Iranian Heavy and Syrian Light too which is why I think Urals cannot stay strong for much longer,&quot; said a refinery trader.</p>
<p>Even with Iraqi Kirkuk talking as high as 25 cents above the May Official Selling Price of Dated Brent -$2.20 a barrel basis fob Ceyhan, traders said it remained a much more attractive option.</p>
<p>&quot;Kirkuk margins are better than Urals by about 50 cents,&quot; said a trader.</p>
