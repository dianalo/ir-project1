<p>Rubber prices in Malaysia were firmer at noon session mainly due to Tokyo's gains, but trading was cautious at the start of the week, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is Monday and people are cautious,&quot; a trader said, adding that prices moved up on some local dealers' covering and gains in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Dealers said some market players were still concerned about the Thai government's decision to default on taking delivery of 23,100 tonnes of rubber last week. &quot;Some are worried because if rubber contracts are defaulted, a lot of rubber will be offered freely in the market,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the market is waiting for inquiries mainly from consumers in the Far East later today.</p>
<p>Dealers offered SMR CV at 295 cents, SMR L at 276, SMR 10 at 246, SMR 20 at 245 and latex at 192.</p>
<p>At noon, August RSS1 buyer rose a cent to 246.50 cents (93 U.S. cents) a kg and August SMR 20 buyer was up half a cent at 245 cents.</p>
<p>Malaysia-based shipping brokers quoted freight rates for rubber from Malaysia to Rotterdam at $700 per 20-ft container, and $1,400 per 40-ft container.</p>
