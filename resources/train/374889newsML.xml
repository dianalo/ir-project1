<p>Britain is right for now to retain its opt-out from the European Union's planned single currency, but it would be wrong not to join in the first wave of countries in 1999 if the conditions are all met, a senior member of the main opposition Labour party said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is right for both opposition and government at the moment to say 'wait and see',&quot; Stuart Bell, a spokesman on trade and corporate affairs, told a business conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But if this is in our national interest -- no one can tell until next year -- then we must go forward,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Labour, like the ruling Conservative party, has agreed to put any cabinet decision to join the single currency to a referendum, which Bell said would be a &quot;historic decision&quot;.</p>
<p>Britain holds the rotating six-month EU presidency in the first half of 1998 when the final decision will be taken on which countries will be eligible to join the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;And if we are able to meet the convergence criteria and then we say to the Europeans we meet the criteria but we are not going to join' that is a very odd position for a trading nation which has 57 percent of its exports going into Europe,&quot; Bell said.</p>
<p>He said there was no point in Britain saying it would join a single currency but only as part of a later, second wave of countries.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are not in on the first wave we'll lose all influence on the European Central Bank. We'll have no executive sitting on that bank,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>If economic and monetary union did go ahead without Britain, Bell said sterling would have to contend with three global currencies -- the dollar, the euro, yen and sterling.</p>
<p>&quot;And where would we be on that basis?&quot; he asked. &quot;Our only long-term future is to create stability for our currency so our exporters have certainty in the future,&quot; he said.</p>
