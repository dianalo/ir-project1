<p>Heavily weighted electronics sector continued its upswing to send Taiwan stock index to a higher close on Friday, and brokers said the technology-led momentum would likely sustain in the near term.</p>
<p>The trendsetting electronics opened stronger with at least four technology shares reaching their uplimits in just 15 minutes, brokers said.</p>
<p>The sector finished 5.47 percent up to send the overall index to a higher close at 9,808.91, up 176.49 points or 1.83 percent, enabling the index to once again stand above the 9,800 level since July 21's 9,833.77 close.  </p>
<p>Turnover was heavy at T$207.8 billion.</p>
<p>Brokers said the bullish trend cleared investors' worries that the sector's strong Thursday rebound could be short-lived.</p>
<p>Electronics rebounded 6.5 percent on Thursday after losing more than 15 percent in five previous sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;Electronics are setting the trend. Everybody is betting on them now,&quot; said Lei Pei-yu, assistant manager of Pacific Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said recent Wall Street rallies also helped fuel the bullish mood.  </p>
<p>Wall Street and Nasdaq composites have risen for three consecutive sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the strong fundamental in the electronic sector, the sector is expected to maintain its uptrend in the near term,&quot; Ben Lee of Nomura Securities said.</p>
<p>More than 10 technology shares rose to the daily limit.</p>
<p>Chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductors was limit up at T$153, rising T$10, and strong rival United Microelectronics had also risen to the seven-percent daily limit to T$128, gaining T$8.  </p>
<p>Acer Sertek, an arm of computer giant Acer Inc, was limit up at T$99, rising T$6.5, while notebook maker Inventec Corp had soared to its daily limit by T$14 to T$218.</p>
<p>Financials rebounded 1.68 percent with the &quot;big three&quot; state-run commercial banks all posting gains.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as financials maintain their gains, and other sectors do not lose heavily, the index should be able to stand above the 9,900 level,&quot; said Albert Lin, manager of Golden Securities.</p>
<p>A 9,800-9,900 range was seen for Saturday.  </p>
