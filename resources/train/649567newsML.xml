<p>Russia will finish terms for converting corporate debt to the federal Pension Fund into tradable securities this week, Prime-Tass new agency quoted privatisation minister Alfred Kokh as saying on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It quoted Kokh, who is a deputy prime minister as well as head of the State Property Committee, as telling a marketing conference that the terms for selling the securities on Russian markets would be set.</p>
<p>A Kokh spokesman was unable to say whether the scheme was part of a government plan to allow major tax debtors to issue securities to be held by the government against arrears payments under debt restructuring plans.</p>
<p>Major companies owed 32.7 trillion roubles ($5.7 billion) in tax arrears as of May 1, the State Tax Service has said.</p>
<p>Kokh was quoted as saying the cabinet will meet on Wednesday to discuss plans to restructure debts owed by Norilsk combine, the main production plant of Norilsk Nickel metals group, to the federal government and pension fund.</p>
<p>It will also discuss debts by oil producer Yuganskneftegaz, the main production unit of a financial group controlled by Bank Menatep, he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Kokh said a government order on restructuring debt of Russia's largest carmaker, AvtoVAZ would be signed soon.</p>
<p>All three have said they would issue securities under the government plan. AvtoVAZ, the single largest tax debtor, owed 2.8 trillion roubles as of April 1, Yuganskneftegaz owed 2.6 trillion and Norilsk combine owed 625 billion roubles.</p>
