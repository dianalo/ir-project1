<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-SENATORS BEAT ISLES, WHO FALTER IN LAST MINUTE AGAIN.</headline>
<dateline>OTTAWA 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Alexandre Daigle scored with 1.5 seconds left in regulation, lifting the Ottawa Senators into a 3-3 tie with the unlucky New York Islanders Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ottawa salvaged its second straight tie by rallying for two goals in the final three minutes of the third period. Daniel Alfredsson sparked the comeback with his second goal of the game, scoring off his own rebound after Eric Fichaud made a blocker save on Alexei Yashin's shot.</p>
<p>The Senators pulled goalie Damian Rhodes for an extra attacker and gained a 6-on-4 advantage when New York's Scott Lachance was called for interference with 35 seconds left.</p>
<p>Fichaud made a stick save on Alfredsson's shot from the right circle, touching off a wild scramble that ended when Daigle poked his own rebound into the net for his first goal of the season.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a 6-on-4, someone had to be open,&quot; said Daigle. &quot;I was in the right place at the right time and took a couple of whacks at it and it went in.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the second straight contest in which the Islanders squandered a lead in the final minute. San Jose's Bernie Nicholls scored with 14 seconds left on Saturday as New York settled for a 2-2 tie.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm pleased with the effort tonight. I did not mind the third period,&quot; said Isles coach Mike Milbury.</p>
<p>&quot;We gained a point tonight. We only let in six goals in three road games. I'm looking forward to our home opener.&quot;</p>
<p>Zigmund Palffy and Niklas Andersson scored first-period goals to stake the Islanders to a 2-0 lead. Alfredsson got Ottawa on the board with 6:29 left in the second period.</p>
<p>Andreas Johansson restored the Islanders' two-goal lead with a power-play tally at 11:06 of the third period.</p>
<p>Rhodes kept the Senators in the game over the first two periods, twice stopping Palffy on breakaways.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Mark Recchi had two goals and two assists and linemates Saku Koivu and Brian Savage each added a goal and two assists as the unbeaten Canadiens broke open a tight game in the third period to beat the Los Angeles Kings 6-3.</p>
<p>Montreal held a one-goal lead after the second period before the teams combined for five goals in the opening 5:04 of the third.</p>
<p>The line of Koivu, Recchi and Savage had 10 points, boosting its three-game total to 20.</p>
<p>The Kings have not beaten the Habs on the road since November 1990. Los Angeles is 0-5-1 at Montreal since then.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Mikhail Shtalenkov turned aside 26 shots for his first career shutout and Teemu Selanne scored a shorthanded goal as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim earned their first win of the season with a 2-0 blanking of the Blackhawks.</p>
<p>Shtalenkov made 11 saves in the first period, six in the second and just three in the third for his first shutout in 59 NHL games.</p>
<p>Chicago pulled goaltender Ed Belfour with 80 seconds left in the third period and had pressure on. But Ducks defenceman Jason Marshall dumped the puck to centre ice where Alex Hicks grabbed it and scored into an empty net with 52 seconds left.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Chris Osgood stopped 18 shots for his ninth career shutout and Vyacheslav Kozlov scored in the first period, as the Red Wings beat the Edmonton Oilers 2-0.</p>
<p>Osgood needed to stop just 11 shots over the first two periods and seven in the third.</p>
<p>Bob Rouse added an empty-net goal with 39 seconds left for the Red Wings, who have split their first two games.</p>
<p>The Oilers had a goal disallowed early in the second period when it was ruled that Andrei Kovalenko directed the puck into the net with his glove.</p>
<p>In Calgary, Grant Fuhr made 31 saves and Jim Campbell and Joe Murphy each scored a goal and set up another, leading the St Louis Blues to a 3-1 victory over the Flames.</p>
<p>Fuhr allowed only rookie Jarome Iginla's power-play goal at 2:38 of the second period and turned away all 10 shots in the final session. In his first three games after off-season knee surgery he has stopped 99 of 106 shots.</p>
<p>Brian Noonan also tallied for St Louis.</p>
<p>The Blues posted their first win in Calgary since January 1994. St Louis had been 0-3-1 in its last four visits to the Saddledome.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, Dominik Hasek capped a 34-save performance with a stellar third period and Brian Holzinger scored the tie-breaking goal with 14:18 remaining as the Buffalo Sabres edged the Canucks 2-1 for their first win of the season.</p>
<p>Hasek allowed a goal by Pavel Bure 14 seconds into the game, then stopped the last 33 shots, including 12 in the third period.</p>
<p>Jason Dawe scored the other goal for Buffalo, which won at Vancouver for the first time since October 1993.</p>
