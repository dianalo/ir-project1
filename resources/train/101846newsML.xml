<p>The United States, concerned about the deteriorating situation in Nigeria, is launching a fresh effort to bring additional sanctions against the military regime there, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on Monday.</p>
<p>Beginning a five-nation trip to sub-Saharan Africa, Christopher told reporters on his airplane that Nigeria is among the topics to be discussed with leaders in Mali -- his first stop -- Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa and Angola.</p>
<p>His talks with heads of states in those African countries will be followed up by consultations with European allies and other African states, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Christopher did not give any details of the suggested additional sanctions, but U.S. officials ruled out that it would include a blanket oil embargo.</p>
<p>Citing human rights abuses and corruption as two key problems, Christopher said Washington &quot;continues to very troubled by our relationship with Nigeria...as much because of the tremendous potential Nigeria has and the failed promise of Nigeria&quot;.</p>
<p>Back in the late 1970's Nigeria seemed to have unlimited opportunity to become a world leader as well as in Africa but that was &quot;forfeited&quot;,  Christopher said.</p>
<p>There were &quot;limmerings of hope last spring&quot; that Nigeria might be turning around when the military regime released seven political prisoners but &quot;that promise has not been fulfilled&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we'll be starting a round of consulations with commonwealth countries and our European allies to see if we can find support for taking further action,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The United States earlier this year discussed with African countries and European allies applying targeted collective sanctions against Nigeria but was told that was &quot;not the right time&quot;, said a senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The new initiative will assess whether views have changed.</p>
<p>Relations between Nigeria and the West reached a low point in November last year with the hanging of nine minority rights activists including author Ken Saro-Wiwa for murder despite international pleas for clemency.</p>
<p>The wave of condemnation and limited sanctions imposed by western countries have forced Nigeria to announce a political reform process but the West said the timetable was very long.</p>
<p>In Christopher's talks this week in Africa and in the subsequent consultations, the adminstration will make clear its view that &quot;pressure without dialogue is unlikely to yield anything as is dialogue without pressure&quot;, the official said.</p>
<p>U.S. officials refused to say publicly what specific new sanctions are being considered.</p>
<p>But some officials said privately that the U.S. proposal centres on freezing Nigerian assets held in overseas accounts, imposing restrictions on new investment in Nigeria and severing sporting ties.</p>
<p>Officials said the plan is to re-introduce the package of sanctions proposed earlier this year.</p>
<p>They said they continue to believe that a unilateral embargo on oil imported from Nigeria does not make sense and there continues to be no appetite in the U.N. Security Council for an international oil embargo.</p>
<p>The United States imports roughly 40 percent of Nigeria's exported oil with the rest going to Europe and Asia. Nigerian imports accounts for about seven percent of U.S. oil needs.</p>
<p>President Clinton in 1993 banned visas for members of Nigeria's regime to visit the United States. A ban on arms sales is in place and Nigerian diplomats are restricted from travelling outside a 25-mile radious of New York and Washington.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States opposes international financial assistance for Nigeria, in part because of its alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking.</p>
