<headline>Florida Panthers stock falls after runup.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Florida Panthers Holdings Inc stock fell amid concerns that its recent run-up may have gone too far.</p>
<p>The stock had tripled since its November initial public offering, but it fell 2-1/2 to 29-1/2 in early trading after a Barron's article said some are shorting the stock because its current valuation is too high.</p>
<p>Raymond James &amp; Associates analyst Budd Bugatch says the stock's meteoric rise was due to the Midas touch of owner Wayne Huizenga, with the &quot;the Huizenga factor&quot; adding an additional $500 million to the company's valuation.  </p>
<p>The stock went public in November at $10 and flat-lined there until December 23, when an announcement that the hockey team's holding company would buy two hotels sent the stock soaring.  It jumped to a $17 close on December 24 and peaked at $32.50 on January 24.</p>
<p>Wall Street is ignoring negative cash flow and focusing on the company's goal to become &quot;a diversified leisure time based sports and entertainment company,&quot; stated in the December 23 announcement, the analyst said.  He rated the stock accumulate in mid-January, when it was near $19.  </p>
<p>Huizenga has built a reputation by acquiring diverse companies and weaving them into hugely successful industries such as Blockbuster video stores, now owned by Viacom Inc, and Republic Industries Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;If their plan is to create an investment conglomerate, they have the capabilities to do so,&quot; Bugatch said.</p>
<p>The company's current valuation by Wall Street is at about $750 million dollars.</p>
