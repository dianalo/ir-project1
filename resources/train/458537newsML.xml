<p>NWE high sulphur fuel oil prices slid on Friday as the product lost some of the value gained from a mid-week swaps and futures rally, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes lost $4 as fundamentals reasserted themselves. Good supply of material and weak end-user demand pushed offer levels down to $84 cif with the notional bid level at around $81-$82. But no trades were heard done.</p>
<p>Three big sellers of high sulphur were reported to have cargoes on offer for early April dates.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges lost $2 to trade in a narrow $88-$89 fob ARA range.</p>
<p>Healthy bunker demand helped prices stabilise later. One trade was done at $86.50 in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>&quot;It was for a very prompt parcel and was not in line with what the market has been doing,&quot; said one trader</p>
<p>Low sulphur cargoes prices were held back by weakness in straight-run, where two refineries this week dumped product at low values to free up storage space.</p>
<p>&quot;Straight-run is keeping the lid on low sulphur in the north and crude's down again which will not help cracked to recover,&quot; said a European trader. There was little interest in low sulphur and no business was heard done.</p>
