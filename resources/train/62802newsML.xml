<p>A detained Chinese dissident went on trial this week on charges of &quot;pledging loyalty&quot; to authorities of Beijing's rival, Taipei, an international human rights group said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Intermediate People's Court in Xi'an in the northern province of Shaanxi began the trial of Zhang Zhong'ai on Monday, the New York-based Human Rights in China, which monitors the human rights situation in China, said.</p>
<p>Details of the trial were not known.</p>
<p>Zhang, 56, lost his seat in the Xi'an People's Congress in 1989 and was jailed for five years for denouncing the military crackdown on Beijing student demonstrations for more democracy that resulted in heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>Agents of the State Security Bureau in Xian -- home to the famed terracotta warriors that guard the grave of China's first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi -- arrested Zhang, a former lecturer at the Xi'an Statistics College, on June 3, the human rights group said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors indicted Zhang on September 3 on charges of spreading &quot;counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement&quot;, the group said.</p>
<p>Court officials declined to comment. Zhang's family could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The bill of indictment accused Zhang of &quot;pledging loyalty to Taiwan authorities&quot; by writing to General Wego Chiang, son of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek who fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war to the communists in 1949.</p>
<p>Beijing's Communists and Taipei's Nationalists have been political rivals for decades, with China conducting intimidatory war games and missile tests off Taiwan last March in the run-up to the island's first direct presidential elections.</p>
<p>The human rights group said it was ridiculous for the indictment to describe Wego Chiang as among the &quot;Taiwanese authorities&quot;, and showed no understanding of the situation in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Chiang dynasty ended in 1988 with the death of president Chiang Ching-kuo, half brother of Wego Chiang. The Chiang family's influence has faded with the rise of the island's first native-born president, Lee Teng-hui.</p>
<p>The human rights group did not say how the Chinese authorities obtained Zhang's letter dated April 1996, in which he sought &quot;guidance and assistance&quot; from the Taiwanese media on how to bring democracy to China.</p>
<p>&quot;It is totally possible for us to realise thorough reform and walk toward democracy and prosperity like Taiwan,&quot; the group quoted Zhang's letter as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;To accelerate the process of this liberalisation, we hope very much for the guidance and assistance of the Taiwanese media,&quot; said the letter from Zhang, who has been raising funds for a private school.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also charged Zhang with receiving $100 from an overseas organisation &quot;hostile&quot; towards China in 1995, the human rights group said.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was accused of spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda and inciting anti-government sentiment through a letter to a friend in the United States and an interview with Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 demonstrations, the group said.</p>
