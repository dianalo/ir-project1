<p>Loading and unloading at public terminals in Brazil's key port of Santos were halted completely in the second day of a strike by a group of administrative portworkers, a port authority spokesman said.</p>
<p>Some 27 ships were docked at the port, of which only five in private terminals were operating this morning.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, five ships had been continuing to load liquid products in public docks but these have now stopped operating, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>Some 37 ships were docked at the port on Tuesday, six of which were in private terminals. It was not clear which ships had left the port as this information was normally provided by the workers who are on strike, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Of those ships hit by the strike on Tuesday, eight were docked to load bagged sugar, one to load bulk sugar and one to load soymeal. Five container vessels were also affected but it is not known if any of these were loading coffee.  </p>
<p>The group of 800 to 1,000 workers stopped work at 0100 local/0400 GMT Tuesday in protest at not being consulted by the CODESP port authority about a switch to 24-hour operations at the port.</p>
<p>A conciliatory meeting between CODESP and the portworkers is scheduled to be held at 1500 local/1800 GMT Wednesday at the Labor Tribunal in Sao Paulo, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Some 23 ships were waiting outside the port to dock. Of these, one vessel was waiting to unload wheat, one to load soymeal and two to take on bulk sugar, he added.</p>
