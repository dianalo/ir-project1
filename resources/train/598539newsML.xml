<headline>France defends oil, gas deals with Iran. [CORRECTED 18:00 GMT]</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>France defended on Tuesday the right of its oil companies to sign contracts with Iran despite unilateral U.S. sanctions, saying Tehran was not subject to any international embargo.</p>
<p>Iran's Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said on Sunday that Tehran had awarded a contract to develop its major South Pars gas field to French oil company Total SA.</p>
<p>The company denied it had signed a deal but said it was interested in the project and talks were continuing.</p>
<p>Oil experts said the contract, reported to be worth $3.5 billion, would require the single biggest investment in the Islamic republic since its 1979 revolution.</p>
<p>The United States has passed legislation to punish foreign oil firms which make investments of more than $40 million (corrects from $50 million) in Iran but the European Union has ordered its firms to pay no heed to the U.S. law.</p>
<p>&quot;The activities of French companies in Iran are entirely legal. There is no international restriction or embargo on Iran,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told a regular briefing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He noted that U.S. oil companies Mobil and Conoco had attended an energy conference in the Iranian city of Isfahan this month alongside French firms.</p>
<p>An official at Iran's state oil company said talks on the South Pars contract were still continuing with Total and also with a rival consortium led by the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell.</p>
<p>Total and Shell have led groups of European and Asian firms aiming to develop South Pars produce 56.64 million cubic metres a day of gas after five years of project work.</p>
<p>Total is already the leading foreign oil investor in Iran after scooping a $600 million deal in 1995 to develop its Sirri E and A offshore gas fields, the latter of which starts production next year.</p>
<p>Relations between Iran and the European Union have been strained since a German court last month implicated top Iranian leaders in the assassination of three dissident Kurds and their translator in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in 1992.</p>
<p>The EU collectively withdrew its ambassadors from Tehran and suspended ministerial contacts with the Islamic republic after the verdict. Iran strenuously denied the allegations.</p>
