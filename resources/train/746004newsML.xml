<p>Despite a U.S. economy that is the envy of the world, Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan was severely criticised Tuesday by members of Congress on both sides of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>The barbs at Greenspan's testimony before a House Banking subcommittee ranged from a socialist warning Greenspan against ripping the social fabric of the country to a Republican questioning if the central bank was analysing bad data.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is in fact performing exceptionally for the rich and the powerful. But for the middle class and working families of this country, the economy continues to decline,&quot; said Vermont Representative Bernard Sanders, the only socialist in Congress.</p>
<p>Economists who credit Greenspan for engineering employment growth and economic stability ignore a growing disparity between the wealthy and the working classes, Sanders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Americans at the bottom end of the wage scale have become the lowest-paid workers in the industrialised world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Representative Barnie Frank applauded the central bank's increased accountability and transparency, but the Massachusetts Democrat criticised the Fed for striving to lower inflation rather than working to cut the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>Frank pointed out that the jobless rate has held at or below 5.0 percent for several months without nearly any sign of an upcreep in inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The financial establishment in general -- including the people who have been dominating the Federal Reserve -- were wrong on what the tolerable level of unemployment was,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Frank said the United States risked social disorder if it did not address the problems of the out-of-work and under-employed.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are to accept that we are not only doing as well as we can, but better than we can expect to do over the long term from an employment standpoint, then this country is in serious social trouble,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Representative Ron Paul, a Republican from Texas, said technology, global competitiveness and low import prices have seemingly mitigated inflation. But he warned that the central bank may be relying on improper or incomplete readings of price tends.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to emphasise ... the importance of looking at the right targets and not being deceived and saying there is no inflation, there is no concern,&quot; Paul said.</p>
<p>He said some proprietary measures of inflation show consumer prices rising much more rapidly than the government's consumer price index.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we should have some concern about some exuberance some place in the economy,&quot; Paul said.</p>
