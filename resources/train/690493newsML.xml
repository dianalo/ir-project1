<p>A senior Bundesbank policymaker has said that Europe's planned monetary union is threatened by &quot;fundamental dissent&quot; between France and Germany and by a lack of political cohesion.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen, in unusually strong remarks, said economic and monetary union (EMU) &quot;hangs in the balance&quot; because last week's Amsterdam summit of European Union leaders had failed to give a solid basis for further political integration.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not against the euro. It can be a good thing if the political and economic preconditions are right. They are not at present,&quot; he told reporters in Frankfurt on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>France and Germany urgently needed to resolve basic differences over French calls for a political counterweight to the European Central Bank and for EU policies to create jobs, he said.</p>
<p>That dissent had placed a heavy burden on European integration, said Jochimsen, a member of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD).</p>
<p>Economists played down Jochimsen's remarks, saying the problems faced by both countries in meeting budget targets for joining the single currency were more dangerous to EMU than any Franco-German rift.</p>
<p>Jochimsen said the EU should stick to the scheduled January 1, 1999 start date for monetary union even if only a small number of countries were able to qualify.</p>
<p>But asked if he saw a danger of a postponement, he said: &quot;Yes, very much so, very much so.&quot;</p>
<p>The stability pact designed to ensure budget discipline after EMU did not guarantee the success of the euro because it lacked teeth in practice and was no substitute for the lack of confidence by EU states in each other, he said.</p>
<p>French calls for an economic pillar to balance the monetary pillar represented by the European Central Bank (ECB) have fuelled deep anxiety in Germany which fears any political interference which might undermine the ECB's independence.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry responded on Thursday to Jochimsen's remarks by saying further European integration would overcome any tensions between Bonn and Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;European construction will result in an easing and an overtaking of these tensions,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told reporters. &quot;This is what the French and German governments are striving for.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists said the political will in both countries to forge EMU remained strong enough to overcome such differences.</p>
<p>It was true that the Amsterdam summit had failed to reform EU decision-making. But the meeting had nevertheless led to deals which showed the Paris-Bonn axis was still intact despite very different philosophies on economics, the analysts said.</p>
<p>The stability pact, devised at Bonn's insistence, had been ratified alongside a resolution on boosting jobs and growth which involved no EU-wide spending and satisfied the demands of France's new Socialist-led government, they said.</p>
<p>Besides, the two philosophies seemed to be moving closer since calls were also growing in Germany for more state intervention to curb unemployment which this year hit levels last seen when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see the fundamental dissent as being that dramatic because it does not affect the very strong political will to start in 1999,&quot; said Mathias Haffner, an economist at BZW.</p>
<p>&quot;France's deficit is a bigger problem because it appears to be heading for at least 3.5 percent (of gross domestic product) this year and that will be hard to sell in Germany.&quot;</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty states a nation's budget deficit must not exceed three percent of its gross domestic product and that its public debt must not exceed 60 percent. But, as Jochimsen noted, it allows an overshoot of those levels in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Bernard Godement, senior economist at Daiwa Institute of Research Europe in London, said: &quot;I think that if there is a threat to monetary union it's in Germany due to the possibility that the government could collapse over its budget problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this week French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine also sought to play down Franco-German differences.</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since it existed people have said every fortnight that the Franco-German motor has broken down,&quot; he told reporters in New York. &quot;There are always issues we agree on and issues we differ on, and the political energy to surmount the difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>Issues at stake were getting more complicated in the run up to monetary union. &quot;It is the problems themselves which have become more complicated. It is not because of Franco-German relations,&quot; he said.</p>
