<p>Shenzhen's B share index ended Wednesday morning slightly lower on a wait-and-see mood after recent sharp rises, analysts said.</p>
<p>The foreign currency B share index lost 1.16 points or 0.65 percent to 177.22 points on turnover of HK$54.5 million, compared with HK$199.4 million for the whole of Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The shrinking turnover shows that investors are putting money aside after the recent steep gains,&quot; an analyst at J&amp;A Securities said.  </p>
<p>The index hit 1997-highs for three straight sessions up to Monday and began a technical correction on Tuesday, analysts said.</p>
<p>The J&amp;A analyst said the correction would probably last until the end of the week before the index picks up again, with investor confidence still strong.</p>
<p>A recent newspaper report said Shenzhen was planning to boost its B share market by improving information flow to Hong Kong investors and making more B share promotional tours abroad.  </p>
<p>The gap between the B shares and A shares, which have risen substantially in the past few months, will also fan buying interest in B shares, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Judging by the A shares, the B shares still have a lot of room to move up,&quot; an analyst at China Guotai Securities said.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expect the index to soon break through the historic high of 201.87 points, scored last December, and to maintain the gains over the Hong Kong handover in July.</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident the index will challenge the 200-point level quite soon,&quot; the Guotai analyst said.  </p>
<p>Motorcycle maker North Jianshe was the worst performer, falling HK$0.12 or 3.09 percent to HK$3.76 on volume of 259,900 shares.</p>
<p>The A share index rose 2.57 points or 0.54 percent to 475.76 on turnover of 5.59 billion yuan.</p>
