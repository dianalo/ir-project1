<p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) is battling to survive as policy-makers fight over whether to break up the telecommunications giant, but all is at least calm on the earnings front.</p>
<p>A cellular phone boom and soaring demand for communication via computers are boosting domestic traffic, benefiting NTT, which has a monopoly over Japan's local networks.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic (earnings) trend is up as increasing city-call traffic is helping NTT's earnings structure,&quot; said Hironobu Sawake, an analyst at Nikko Research Center.</p>
<p>But NTT, threatened by calls from the powerful Posts and Telecommunications Ministry to break it up, will continue to face heavy pressure to slash long-distance call rates and the fees for using its city-call networks, both criticised as too high compared with international standards, Sawake added.</p>
<p>The government, which owns 65 percent of NTT, has postponed a decision on whether to split it up until next year. NTT itself opposes being split into three different firms.</p>
<p>In the current business year to the end of next March, NTT will receive a big chunk of money from cell phone operators for using its local networks.</p>
<p>Analysts expect access charges paid to NTT by cell phone operators to easily top 200 billion yen ($1.80 billion) during the year, up from 125.8 billion yen ($1.13 billion) in 1995/96.</p>
<p>This is on top of an expected 235 billion yen ($2.11 billion) in access charges from long-distance call operators such as DDI Corp and Japan Telecom Co.</p>
<p>&quot;Deregulation...and an activated telecommunications market mean more customers for NTT,&quot; said Toshiho Sato, an analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>Various new communications services are planned next year, such as cut-rate long-distance call services by leased line operators, which all use NTT's network.</p>
<p>Eric Gan, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects NTT's profits from local calls to catch up with those from long-distance calls within two years, buoyed by new services and a rise in the number of users accessing the Internet through personal computers.</p>
<p>Long-distance call services now account for 75 percent of NTT's parent operating profit.</p>
<p>Despite the booming traffic, however, analysts expect NTT's parent current profit to stay mostly in line with its own estimate of around 234 billion yen ($2.10 billion) this business year, due to planned cuts in long-distance call rates and access charges.</p>
<p>Current profit is pre-tax, and includes profits and losses from non-operational activities such as stock investments.</p>
<p>NTT has pledged to open up its network to rival telephone operators at &quot;appropriate costs&quot; and cut long-distance call rates by early next year.</p>
<p>Analysts predict NTT's current profit for the half-year to be around 110 billion yen ($990 million), against 126.78 billion yen ($1.14 billion) a year earlier, as large rate cuts implemented in March will affect earnings.</p>
<p>NTT's cuts in access charges, on the other hand, will benefit its long-distance rival Japan Telecom.</p>
<p>Makio Inui, an analyst at Salomon Brothers (Asia), has revised upward his forecast for Japan Telecom's parent current profit in 1996/97 to 48 billion yen ($432 million) from an earlier forecast of 39 billion yen ($351 million).</p>
<p>NTT will disclose parent half-year results and full-year forecasts on November 22 and Japan Telecom on November 21. ($1=111 yen)</p>
