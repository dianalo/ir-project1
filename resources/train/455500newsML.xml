<p>Volumes on the bourse were slightly lower on Thursday with most shares stable, dealers said.</p>
<p>Market turnover came to 201,000 lats versus yesterday's 211,000 lats. The Rietumu index rose 0.44 percent to 228.35.</p>
<p>Valmiera Glassfibre was most traded at 79,200 lats as it slipped to 2.10 lats from 2.12 lats on good demand and supply of 118,400 and 11,600 shares respectively.</p>
<p>On the official list, Riga Transport Fleet (RTF) showed some movement after a long period of stability. It rose to 1.73 lats from 1.66 on turnover of 17,300 lats.</p>
<p>&quot;RTF went above 1.70. This seemed to be a single trade rather than a trend,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;Today was pretty calm, in line with the whole week although the first general meeting results were there,&quot; he added, speaking of Lode Brick, which confirmed yesterday the results of its shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>Other official list stocks Unibanka and Staburadze were stable at 4.70 lats and 2.78 lats respectively on trade of 13,000 and 8,900 lats each.</p>
<p>After a good run recently, Lode Brick dropped to 2.61 lats from 2.87 lats on turnover of 1,300 lats.</p>
<p>Dealers said the share dropped as people decided to sell the stock and take profits rather than wait and receive a planned issue of bonus shares.</p>
<p>Other active stocks included Daugavpils Chain on turnover of 37,400 lats but it was unchanged at 2.80 lats.</p>
