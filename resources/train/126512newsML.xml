<headline>Argentine leader sues opponent for mafia comment.</headline>

<p>Argentine President Carlos Menem on Friday sued a former aide turned political opponent who sought to discredit Menem's anti-corruption campaign by likening him to a mafia boss.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in federal court charges that Gustavo Beliz, Menem's former interior minister and current leader of a fledgling political movement, attacked the &quot;honor&quot; of the Peronist president. It also named two top editors of the Pagina/12 newspaper as defendants for a bold front-page headline that it charged maliciously drew a direct link between Menem and the mafia.</p>
<p>Menem, who has initiated similar lawsuits in the past, wants a retraction from Beliz and from editors Fernando Socolowicz and Ernesto Tiffenberg.</p>
<p>Beliz's comments came after Menem announced an anti-corruption crusade to root graft from the public service. He was Menem's interior minister from 1992-1993 but left alleging the government was a &quot;viper's nest&quot; of corruption.</p>
<p>He formed the New Leadership party and was soundly defeated in Buenos Aires mayoral elections this year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit quotes Beliz as saying, &quot;Society does not believe the president when he says he will fight against the mafia because a large part of the public sees him almost as the boss or responsible for this type of attitude.&quot;</p>
<p>It adds that the daily, which ran a headline saying &quot;Menem is the mafia boss&quot; next to a large picture of Beliz, &quot;reproduced the injurious comments with a touch of malice.&quot;</p>
<p>Beliz was referring to several government officials who have left office under suspicion of corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;Saying someone is the head of the mafia attacks his honour,&quot; the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>Former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo accused two cabinet ministers this week of covering up corruption and manipulating judges. The government denied the charges.</p>
<p>The World Bank and International Monetary Fund recently urged Argentina to intensify its efforts to crack down on corruption.</p>
