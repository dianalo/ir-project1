<p>Hong Kong stocks pushed ahead in Wednesday morning trade with shares in HSBC Holdings once again leading the way ahead of the banking giant's results announcement on Monday.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index was up 68.22 points, or 0.50 percent, at 13,588.48. Turnover was HK$2.94 billion after the first hour minutes of trade.</p>
<p>&quot;It's mainly Hongkong Bank leading it up on expectations of good results on Monday,&quot; said Geoff Galbraith, institutional sales at NAVA SC Securities. He said NAVA was expecting 1996 net profit of HK$36.1 billion.</p>
<p>HSBC posted 1995 net profit of HK$30.04 billion. Its shares were up HK$1.00 at HK$194.50 after hitting an all-time high at HK$195.50 during early trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The market generally expects Hongkong Bank's results will be exceptionally good and that also benefits other major banking counters like Hang Seng Bank,&quot; said Edward Chan, head of research at Amsteel Securities.</p>
<p>Shares in Hang Seng Bank rose HK$0.25 to HK$92.00.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also seeing strong performance on major developers,&quot; added Chan. Cheung Kong rose HK$0.50 to HK$73.75 and Henderson Land gained HK$0.75 to HK$70.75.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HK$0.50 to HK$90.25.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect there will be more than 2,000 residential units launched in the market in the month of March and the sales of all these units will help these development companies fetch more than HK$11 billion in sales,&quot; said Chan.</p>
<p>But brokers said the Hang Seng Index may struggle to push further ahead with U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan due to present his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the Senate Banking Committee later in the day. &quot;A lot of eyes are going to be on Mr Greenspan,&quot; said Galbraith.</p>
<p>Shares in Hopewell Holdings were actively traded and gained HK$0.20 to HK$4.70.</p>
<p>Some red chips also remained in favour. Shanghai Industrial rose HK$0.30 to HK$32.60, China Resources gained HK$0.60 to HK$17.55 and China Overseas was up HK$0.10 at HK$4.55.</p>
