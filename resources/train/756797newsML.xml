<p>The Australian government on Friday cancelled the visitor visa held by former U.S. Black Panther Lorenzo Ervin, blocking any future attempts by the human rights activist to return to Australia.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the immigration minister said Ervin was believed to have left the country early on Friday.</p>
<p>The government's plan to have Ervin deported earlier this month was foiled when a court ruled there had been a procedural error in the way Ervin's visa was cancelled.</p>
<p>Ervin, convicted in 1969 of hijacking an aircraft from the United States to Cuba, was in Australia for a four-week speaking tour on the invitation of anarchist group Angry People.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said the latest decision was based on Ervin's convictions for air piracy, kidnapping and for the assault of a corrections officer.</p>
<p>&quot;I was satisfied that there has been no pardon amounting to a finding of innocence on these matters,&quot; Ruddock said in a statement. &quot;I weighed these convictions against the countervailing factors going to Mr Ervin's good character.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Having full regard to all these matters, I formed the view that Mr Ervin is not of good character.&quot;</p>
<p>Ervin received two life sentences for the 1969 hijacking, but was released from jail in 1983.</p>
<p>The Australian government cancelled Ervin's first visa on the grounds that he had apparently misrepresented his past when he used a different surname when applying for the visa.</p>
<p>Ervin also failed to fill in his passenger entry card indicating that he had been convicted of an offence requiring him to be jailed for more than 12 months.</p>
<p>The government then rejected two new visa applications from Ervin and tried to have him deported, saying it was not in the national interest for a convicted hijacker to stay in Australia.</p>
