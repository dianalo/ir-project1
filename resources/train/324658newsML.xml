<title>SINGAPORE: Asia Gas Oil/Jet - Diesel mixed as slide persists.</title>
<headline>Asia Gas Oil/Jet - Diesel mixed as slide persists.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-01-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>After collapsing for more than two weeks, gas oil prices took a brief breather earlier in the day before continuing its slide, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said they hope that recent cuts in runs at three refineries in Singapore would soon help to ease the gas oil glut and boost prices in forward months.</p>
<p>Singapore gas oil premiums also took a beating falling to parity to Singapore spot quotes, from 20 cents previously. There was even talk that a cargo might have been bought by a Malaysian firm recently at a discount to Singapore quotes for a 20,000-tonne cargo, free-on-board (fob) basis.</p>
<p>Traders said there were buying interest at 50 cents discount to spot Singapore quotes.</p>
<p>Unlike Singapore, the MidEast market still looked steady with premiums for 1.0-percent sulphur gas oil at a 55-cent per barrel to MidEast quotes fob, while prompt cargoes were seen as high as 80-cent premium.</p>
<p>Trader said the healthy MidEast market was due to sellers coverind their sales into India for February from that region, which could not be done with cargoes from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Traders said Indonesia recently bought a gas oil cargo from a US major at a 20-cent-per barrel premium, on a cost-and-freight basis for February delivery.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps rebounded by as much as 40 cents from Tuesday on profit-taking and a technical correction. February was quoted at $25.40/$25.60 and March at $25.70/$25.90. Some traders said the rebound could partially be due to optimistic forecast on the volume of gas oil that India would take for March.</p>
<p>But physical gas oil defied the recovery seen on swaps with two traders offering at $24.80 for mid-February lifting cargoes fob, down from $25.50-$25.80 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But traders said buyers remained aloof as they were waiting for the contango to widen to at least 60 cents from the current 30-40 cents in order for them to buy and cover the cost of putting the cargoes into storage.</p>
<p>Traders see jet fuel price at more than $2.00 a barrel above gas oil with premiums at 30 cents. They said the $1.90 per barrel premium, cost-and-freight, which a major sold to China recently signalled a steady jet fuel market.</p>
<p>With Japan and South Korea out of the market, China appeared to be the best outlet for jet fuel, traders said.</p>
