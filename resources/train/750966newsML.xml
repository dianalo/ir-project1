<headline>UK ITV &quot;big three&quot; gain on licence proposals.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-23</dateline>

<p>Shares in Britain's three largest commercial TV (ITV) companies rose on Wednesday on proposals to base more of their licence fees on revenue rather than a fixed fee.</p>
<p>United News &amp; Media added 25p to 705p, Carlton Communications Plc gained 12p to 486p while Granada was up 8.5p t0 771p by 0815 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The variable nature of the costs is to be welcomed,&quot; said Robert Jolliffe of ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett.  </p>
<p>The Independent Television Commission (ITC), in draft proposals on licence renewal, said the balance would shift towards payments based on revenue to reflect uncertainties surrounding ITV as competition grows.</p>
<p>The regional ITV companies and GMTV paid a total of 412 million for their licences in 1996, 257 million stg drawn from fixed fees and the rest based on revenue. Under the proposals, as much as 75 percent of the fee could in future be based on revenue.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO's Jolliffe said United News stood to benefit as it had stakes in a number of regional broadcasters paying high fixed fees.</p>
<p>Jason Crisp of SocGen said the shift gave ITV companies welcome protection should their revenue fall.</p>
<p>But he said there was no indication that the total ITV take would fall, He also noted the government planned to phase out the &quot;funding formula&quot; which has resulted in net payments from state-controlled Channel 4 to ITV.</p>
<p>This system, designed as a safety net when C4 began to sell its own airtime, benefited the ITV companies to the tune of 87 million stg ITV last year.</p>
<p>ITV companies can apply to renew their licences with effect from Janaury 1, 1999. The licences run until 2003 but those not renewed by 2001 will be re-advertisied and re-awarded, a two-year process.</p>
