<p>Another growth spurt in Britain's already lively services sector in May will increase pressure on the Bank of England's new monetary policy committee to raise interest rates at its first meeting this week.</p>
<p>The May PMI services sector survey on Wednesday showed business activity picked up pace in the month, with new and outstanding business both rising.</p>
<p>&quot;This survey shows that growth in the largest part of the economy has accelerated again,&quot; said David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders.</p>
<p>But while the survey adds to the growing pile of evidence which the newly empowered Bank could use to justify a rate rise on Friday, Philpotts said it may feel obliged to wait until July.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank is probably itching to raise rates, but the next month will bring the budget, news on the inflation target and evidence on the impact the windfall payments are having on consumption, so I think it may decide to hold off until July.&quot;</p>
<p>The budget will be held on July 2, and the Mansion House speech on June 12 will contain news on the inflation target.</p>
<p>Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets, says while he is sticking to the firm's central forecast that the Bank will wait until July before moving, the PMI services survey makes the outcome of this week's meeting even more difficult to forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;This survey has made a close call even closer, but we are still inclined to look for no change on Friday, if only because of the proximity to the last increase and the possibility of a fiscal tightening in the budget.&quot;</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of 21 economists showed a narrow majority favouring a rate rise this week with 12 expecting base rates to rise to 6.5 percent on Friday from the present 6.25 percent.</p>
<p>The monetary policy committee meets for the first time on Thursday and Friday, with four Bank officials and two of the new outside appointees attending and voting on a rate rise. The outcome of the meeting will be announced at 1100 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>The monetary authorities are faced with the dilemma of a two-speed economy. The smaller manufacturing sector has been ravaged by sterling's strength and is growing only slowly, while the much bigger services sector is booming.</p>
<p>A rate rise may send the pound even higher, hitting the weakest part of the economy hardest.</p>
<p>Signs of inflationary pressure are already apparent in the services sector and have shown up in official data as well as surveys.</p>
<p>Average earnings have picked up strongly in the services sector and actual earnings grew 5.0 percent in the year to March, while final service sector prices rose 3.3 percent in the year to April compared with just 1.7 percent in goods.</p>
<p>The PMI services survey showed skill shortages in many sectors, especially computing, were pushing up wages and salaries, but firms were not managing to pass them on to customers.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflationary pressure are clear in the service sector, with firms having to pay more to attract and retain staff,&quot; said Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist at NatWest Markets. &quot;But it remains more difficult to pass these costs through to customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost 23 percent of companies reported higher costs in May but only 12 percent were able to raise prices, while seven percent actually had to cut prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, the Bank will not take comfort from these figures,&quot; said Dicks.</p>
<p>Loynes said this inability to pass on higher prices meant the outlook for inflation later this year was bright.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact firms cannot pass on higher costs to employers means any futher rise in service sector inflation this year will be relatively modest, and more than offset by falling goods' prices as lower factor gate inflation feeds into the high street.&quot;</p>
