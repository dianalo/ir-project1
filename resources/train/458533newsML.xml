<headline>N.Sea crudes overshadowed by 10 unsold April Brent.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>North Sea spot crude ended the week under pressure from 10 unsold early April Brent cargoes held by BP, while paper pointed to softer values ahead, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Three Brents due to load April 5-9 were kept by BP ahead of the five o'clock deadline, adding to its existing collection of seven due to load in the first six days of the month.</p>
<p>A March 29-31 Brent was done late on Thursday confidentially and Dated-related but details were not available. Traders said it left one Brent unsold from the March programme.</p>
<p>A Flotta loading April 6-8 traded on Friday at the unchanged level of Dated Brent minus $1.09.</p>
<p>Shipping brokers said Glencore provisionally fixed the ULCC Jahre Pollux to take 350,000 tonnes of Brent to the U.S. in late March or early April but traders doubted the arbitrage was open.</p>
<p>The outright price softened in later futures trade, with May IPE down six cents at $20.12 a barrel.</p>
<p>Paper was also softer. On CFDs, next week's dates traded at May -50 cents, while the following week traded at June -36 cents. The weeks finished at May -53 cents and May -40 cents respectively, about 5-10 cents under than Thursday's levels.</p>
<p>Intermonth paper spreads continued to lose value. April/May was assessed at flat, while May/June traded later at +5 cents and June/July changed hands at +8 cents.</p>
<p>Other North Sea grades were better supported. But BP's maintenance of run cuts at Rotterdam, where Texaco restored throughput on Thursday, could block further gains.</p>
<p>The West African crude market continued its tentative recovery from March lows as sales of April barrels gathered pace, traders said.</p>
