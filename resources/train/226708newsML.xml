<p>Five people were murdered in a Sao Paulo slum in what police believe may have been a dispute over an electricity bill, newspapers reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Correio Braziliense newspaper said a 53-year-old mother and four members of her family were executed with shots to the head and chest early on Friday by three armed men.</p>
<p>Four members of the family, including the badly wounded father, survived.</p>
<p>Quoting a police commander in the Panorama shantytown, Correio said the family had shared an electricity line with neighbours and that there had been an argument about a bill.</p>
<p>It added that owners of the land had also ordered the eviction of the family.</p>
<p>&quot;It may well have been some kind of revenge killing. Apart from the issue of the electricity bill, we will have to investigate the eviction order,&quot; said police commander Euclides Batista de Souza.</p>
<p>Newspapers said the murders brought the number of multiple killings in Sao Paulo to 46 this year, in which 162 people have died.</p>
