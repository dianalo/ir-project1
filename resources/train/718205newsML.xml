<p>Retailers sold a record 300,000 copies of Nintendo Co.'s new Star Fox 64 video game in its first five days, executives of the video game maker said Tuesday.</p>
<p>At a suggested retail price of $69.95, that represents an opening week &quot;box office&quot; take of nearly $21 million, the equivalent of a top Hollywood movie.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America Executive Vice President Peter Main said in an interview he expected sales to top 800,000 units, or nearly $56 million, by the end of August.</p>
<p>Main said Nintendo shipped 400,000 copies of the game to retailers in time for the July 1 launch.</p>
<p>&quot;To everyone's absolute amazement the product absolutely evaporated within 72 to 96 hours of it arriving there,&quot; Main said.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo had a hand in a huge publicity campaign ahead of the launch.</p>
<p>The company even mailed videotapes to 1 million owners of the Nintendo 64 console extolling the new game, an intergalactic battle adventure that features vibrating feedback in the game's hand-held controller.</p>
<p>The game also benefited from positive comment on the Internet generated by the April launch of the game in Japan, Main said.</p>
<p>Nintendo 64 owners likely are hungry for titles, which have been relatively scarce since the machine was launched late last year, propelling the company past rivals Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Sony Corp. and back into the No. 1 position in hardware sales.</p>
<p>Main said the U.S. installed base of Nintendo 64 consoles is about 3 million units, meaning that one in four owners will buy the new game by the end next month, according to company projections.</p>
<p>That is equivalent to Nintendo's all-time best-selling Super Mario 3 game, which sold 7.5 million units to an installed base of about 32 million owners of the original Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>
<p>Nintendo officials said the industry's previous record game launch was last year's Super Mario 64, which sold about 200,000 copies in the first week.</p>
<p>Main noted that summer is typically a slow period for the video game industry, but Nintendo has seen a spurt in hardware sales along with the strong opening for Star Fox 64.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is any indication, we're in for a very good summer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Nintendo is on track to meet its projection that it will sell 12 million units worldwide of the Nintendo 64 device, including 6 million in the United States, by the end of its fiscal year in March 1998.</p>
