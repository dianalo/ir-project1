<p>An unexpectedly benign report on fourth quarter employment costs soothed inflation jitters Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 100 points by midday and fuelling a sharp rise in bonds.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to its highest level against the Japanese yen in nearly four years and surged to the highest level against the German mark in more than 2-1/2 years.</p>
<p>The rally in stocks and bonds came after the Labour Department reported a smaller-then-expected rise in workers' compensation in its Employment Cost Index for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Economists said the release of the Labour Department report, which showed that labour costs -- or wages and benefit costs combined --  rose by a tolerable 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>This pushed back expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates soon, spurring the broad market rally.</p>
<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve is likely to remain on hold, not just at the February meeting (of its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee), but through the first half of the year and perhaps a little bit longer,&quot; said Cheryl Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Over the previous four trading sessions, the Dow had shed more than 200 points and bond prices had slumped, sending the yield toward the key 7 percent level, in anticipation of unwelcome news on the inflation front.</p>
<p>But after seeing the labour cost report, which rose by less than the 0.9 percent Wall Street economists had anticipated, the markets breathed a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street came in today (Tuesday) prepared for the worst. When that didn't happen, you saw a market with no sellers and a lot of anxious buyers,&quot; Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>After briefly posting a gain of more than 100 points at midday, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 83.13 points at 6,743.82 in early afternoon.</p>
<p>The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond surged more than a full point, sending its yield down to 6.85 percent from 6.94 percent on Monday. The yield and the price move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>The dollar, which opened sharply higher after rising to a fresh 47-month high against the yen and 31-month peak against the mark overseas, cheered the bond rally and rose above 121 yen for the first time since February, 1993.</p>
<p>By early afternoon the dollar was at 121.10 yen, slightly off its high of 121.50. The dollar had retreated against the mark to trade at 1.6480 marks, down from an earlier high of 1.6570.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the Employment Cost Index has become a more important indicator for the markets thanks to Fed policymakers, including Chairman Alan Greenspan, who have said the Fed looks closely at the report in gauging inflation.</p>
<p>Just last week, Greenspan warned of the risks of wage-driven inflation in his testimony to the Senate Budget Committee, raising concern in markets that Tuesday's wage report could prompt an interest rate increase by the Fed.</p>
<p>Some economists said that, regardless of Tuesday's benign report, tight labour markets should engender decent gains in wages, and possibly fuel inflation, as 1997 unfolds.</p>
<p>But others pointed out that throughout 1996, even as the unemployment rate drifted down to almost 5 percent, few signs of wage-driven inflation surfaced.</p>
<p>According to the Labour Department's report, wages and salaries rose 3.3 percent over the full year 1996, but more modest growth of 2.0 percent in benefits costs dragged down total compensation gains to 2.9 percent.</p>
<p>Those represent only slight increases from 1995's well-behaved compensation growth of 2.7 percent and wages and salaries growth of 2.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Although wages have picked up a little bit, overall compensation which is what matters, is rising barely steadily at 3 percent. I think this is pretty good news,&quot; said James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc.</p>
