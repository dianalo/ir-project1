<title>USA: Street mulls Societe Generale's big muni purchases.</title>
<headline>Street mulls Societe Generale's big muni purchases.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Societe Generale's unusually large municipal bond purchases in recent weeks may be part of a commonly used strategy to create synthetic short- term tax-exempt debt, market participants said this week.</p>
<p>While municipal issuers sell mostly long-term debt, tax- exempt money market funds holding tens of billions of dollars are required by law to hold short-term debt.</p>
<p>Wall Street firms have profitably exploited the mismatch for years by using financial engineering to transform unwanted long-term bonds into short-term obligations.  </p>
<p>A firm buys long-term bonds and places the securities in a trust or partnership, which then issues short-term securities backed by the bonds. Derivatives are often used by the firm to make the synthetic short-term securities money-market eligible and to hedge interest rate risk.</p>
<p>In a tender option bond program, a firm attachs a put option to a long term bond, allowing the holder to sell it back to the trust or partnership at par, usually once a week.  </p>
<p>While officials at Societe Generale Thursday and again Friday declined to comment on the rumored purchase of $1 billion of muni bonds, or its intentions for them, some market players said the bank is probably using the bonds in a tender option program.</p>
<p>&quot;It would most likely be for what's called a tender option bond program, what's sometimes referred to as a partnership program,&quot; one market source said, emphasizing he could not say for sure what Soc Gen's plans might be. Citibank was the originator of the programs in 1980 and some 20 such programs currently exist around the Street, the source said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of them around,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A Citibank spokeswoman could not immediately confirm that information.</p>
<p>Market sources earlier this week said Societe Generale has been involved in a number of major deals of late. One bond fund source said Societe Generale appeared to be involved in the recent $934 million Port Authority of New York and New Jersey deal.</p>
<p>In addition, a New York City official, who declined to be named, said Societe Generale ordered $100 million in two maturities in a recent New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority bond sale. The purchase closed out both maturities.</p>
