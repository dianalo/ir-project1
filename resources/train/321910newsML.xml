<p>Swedish transportation company ASG said on Tuesday it had set up a subsidiary in Lithuania.</p>
<p>&quot;We are following with interest the fast development in the Baltic countries and adjusting our customer solutions and organisation accordingly,&quot; said Lars Sundman, managing director of ASG Specialist Companies AB, in a statement.</p>
<p>ASG now has around 54 employees in its operations in the Baltics, which are in Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius, ASG project leader Ulf Pettersson told Reuters.</p>
<p>ASG moved some 140,000 tonnes to the Baltic countries in 1996, of which 90 percent was by sea and 10 percent by air, Pettersson said. In Lithuania imports far exceeded exports while in Estonia and Latvia they were more or less equal.</p>
<p>Surface transport in the region had increased significantly, with growth in 1996 more than 100 percent for Latvia and 80 percent for Estonia compared to the previous year. Air cargo was far less developed, Pettersson said.</p>
<p>Air cargo to the Baltics was mostly trucked to the region after having been flown into Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen, he said.</p>
<p>ASG's Baltic companies have access to terminals of 2,000-3,000 square metres, ASG said.</p>
