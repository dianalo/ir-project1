<headline>BOC shares gain after top-end results.</headline>

<p>Shares in BOC Group Plc were quoted higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday, bouncing back from recent weakness after the company posted results at the top end of the range of analyst expectations.</p>
<p>The stock, which yesterday dropped 19-1/2p at one stage to its lowest intraday level since October 1995, was quoted up 14-1/2p at 850-1/2 by 0718 GMT.  </p>
<p>&quot;The numbers look fine, they are at the top of the range and they are probably good enough after the stock's turbulent recent past,&quot; said one senior equity salesman.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a palpable sigh of relief from those that have stood by BOC in recent months, when it has underperformed by some 15 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the question is whether they are good enough to put what has been a pretty dismal performance behind it,&quot; the salesman said.  </p>
<p>The industrial and medical gases group posted a rise in yearly pretax profit to 444.9 million stg from 402.2 million a year before and raised its dividend to 29.0p from 27.0p</p>
<p>Analyst pretax profit expectations had mostly been in a range between 421.0 million stg and 445.0 million and the dividend was expected to be between 27.0p and 29.0p. &quot;While we expect another challenging year in health care, with pressure in the U.S. market continuing, expansion into other markets and some new product introductions should provide sales growth,&quot; said Danny Rosenkranz, chief executive.  </p>
<p>The company said the economic backgroud was one of slower growth than last year in most key markets but on balance it remained strong.</p>
<p>North America and North Pacific still maintained respectable growth rates, it said, and it was &quot;expecting a similar pattern for the year ahead.&quot;</p>
