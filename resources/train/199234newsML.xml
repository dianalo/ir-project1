<p>Eurotunnel Plc said on Tuesday fire damage to the tunnel was worse than first thought but the channel tunnel operator still hopes to run a service on Wednesday, the Press Association news agency reported.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of mess down there. Our people will be working throughout the night but I think we have to be less optimistic than we were earlier,&quot; said Eurotunnel operations director, Alain Bertrand. &quot;Clearly there is more to do to restore services and equipment which were damaged by the fire.&quot;  </p>
<p>Hopes had been high earlier on Tuesday that the undamaged Channel tunnel railtrack would begin a partial service on Wednesday morning but Bertrand said some travellers may be allowed through on Wednesday afternoon &quot;at the very earliest&quot;.</p>
<p>Senior Eurotunnel staff, including president Patrick Ponsolle, went into the tunnel to see at first hand the havoc caused by a fire in a lorry which shut down the Channel Tunnel for the first time since operations began in 1994.</p>
<p>Bertrand said one of the main lines of inquiry would be a suggestion that one lorry's cargo was already smouldering before the freight train entered the tunnel at Calais.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking into that. It may be there were the beginnings of a fire early on which our fire alarms did not detect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It might have been that it did not become a big fire until the train was inside the tunnel.&quot;</p>
