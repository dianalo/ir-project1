<p>Russia's AO Chernogorneft oil company, a main producing arm of SIDANKO, said on Wednesday that its crude oil output in 1997 would rise to 5.70 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Chernogorneft  0#CHGZ.RUO board secretary Boris Korolyov said the company was still calculating its 1996 output levels, which the firm had earlier forecast at 5.11 million tonnes but which may be running below target.</p>
<p>Korolyov said the 1997 production forecast did not include output by joint ventures.</p>
<p>Chernogorneft hopes to boost crude oil output to 6.14 million tonnes in 1998.</p>
<p>Korolyov said that a $43.7 million credit from the Export-Import Bank of the United States would be used to rehabilitate idle and under-performing wells. About 1,280 of the company's 2,300 wells are not working.</p>
<p>Chernogorneft would drill 65 new wells and 46 exploration wells at the giant Samotlor field, one of Russia's largest.</p>
<p>The company, which has issued level-one American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Chernogorneft said last year that its pre-tax profit in the first three quarters of 1996 was $53.7 million on net sales of $362.4 million, according to Russian accruals-based accounting standards, for which comparisons are not available.</p>
<p>NK SIDANKO (Sibirsko-Dalnevostochnaya Neftyanaya Kompaniya) is one of Russia's leading vertically-integrated oil companies.</p>
<p>Russia's Uneximbank group (Oneksimbank in Russian) has control over Chernogorneft as Bank MFK, backed by Uneximbank, won control of a 51 percent stake in SIDANKO in a government shares for loans auction last year.</p>
