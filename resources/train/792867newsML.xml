<p>Meadow Valley Corp said Tuesday backlog has reached an all-time high of $171 million.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Bradley Larson said this reflects &quot;solid business conditions in our primary markets in Arizona, Nevada, Utah and New Mexico and, based on current project completion schedules, the second half of the year looks to be significantly busier than the first half.&quot;</p>
<p>The company reported net income for the second quarter was $359,000, or $0.10 per share, on revenue of $32,555,000. The profits included $159,000 of pretax expenses associated with start-up of the company's Prestressed Products Inc business.  </p>
<p>For the first six months of 1997, net income was $492,000, or $0.14 per share, which included $736,000 of pretax expenses associated with the start-up of the company's new Ready Mix Inc and Prestressed Products businesses in Las Vegas and the expansion of Utah area operations.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in gross margin to 5.8 percent for the second quarter from 0.4 percent for last year's second quarter and from 5.0 percent for this year's first quarter are encouraging signs that the programs implemented during the past year to streamline operations and to monitor and control costs are working,&quot; Larson said.  </p>
<p>He said Ready Mix was marginally profitable in its first full month of operations in April and this high quality concrete supplier has shown steady improvement since then.</p>
<p>Prestressed Products is still in the start-up phase, but its backlog has increased to about $8 million, Larson said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect PPI to be profitable in the second half,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, he said Meadow Valley hired key personnel and began making arrangements to acquire the equipment required to enter the &quot;white&quot; (concrete) paving business, a key component of urban freeway work.</p>
<p>&quot;White paving capability is crucial to the company as we pursue urban freeway infrastructure work in our target markets,&quot; Larson explained.</p>
