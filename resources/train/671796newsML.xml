<headline>Cineplex rises on merger speculation.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-06-19</dateline>

<p>Cineplex Odeon Corp shares jumped on Thursday on published reports that theater operator is in merger talks with Sony Corp's Loews Theatres arm.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect that today's move is (linked to the reports),&quot; said Roger Dent, an entertainment analyst with Yorkton Securities. &quot;If a merger between Cineplex and Loews took place it should be very beneficial because of the ability to obtain efficiencies by combining the two groups.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares of Toronto-based Cineplex jumped as much as 0.19 to 2.64 in early trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. More than 390,000 shares changed hands. In New York Cineplex shares rose 1/8 to 1 7/8 with more than one million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Reports in Variety and The Hollywood Report cited unnamed sources who claimed Cineplex and Loews are in talks to fashion some type of merger.</p>
<p>The companies together have about 2,500 movie screens in 450 locations. If combined Cineplex and Loews would rank as North America's second largest theater chain.</p>
<p>Company officials from both Cineplex and Sony declined comment on the reported talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a longstanding corporate policy of not confirming or denying rumors and that's exactly what this is, so we're not going to confirm or deny,&quot; said Howard Lichtman, executive vice-president of marketing and communications for Cineplex.</p>
<p>Yorkton's Dent -- who has Cineplex rated as a buy -- noted that there is a good geographic match between the two companies and Cineplex has previously shown interest in pursuing these types of discussions.</p>
<p>&quot;Loews would be a highly logical partner, so I would see no reason not to believe that the rumors are true. But whether that ultimately translates into the announcement of a deal is another matter,&quot; said Dent.</p>
<p>In 1995 Cineplex attempted to merge with Dallas-based Cinemark USA Inc in a deal which would have created the world's largest theater chain at the time. However, the planned merger was called off.</p>
<p>Cineplex's major shareholders include Seagram Co's Universal Inc unit and Montreal's Bronfman family, which also controls Seagram. Universal holds 41.6 percent of the theater operator while the Bronfman family directly holds another 24.6 percent of Cineplex's shares.</p>
