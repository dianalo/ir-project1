<p>The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has set 1997 as the year for improving risk control in the securities and futures markets, the Shanghai Securities News said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The focus of work for 1997 will be preventing and reducing risk by strengthening market supervision and standardising market activity,&quot; a notice from the CSRC, China's top securities watchdog, was quoted by the newspaper as saying.</p>
<p>The aim of the campaign &quot;is to maintain market stability and create favourable social conditions for Hong Kong's return to China and the convening of the 15th national congress of the Chinese Communist Party,&quot; the CSRC said in a circular.  </p>
<p>The measure comes after a strong bull run on China's stock markets. Share prices on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have risen more than 50 percent since the start of this year despite official warnings on risk, analysts said.</p>
<p>The rises have been largely backed up by a fundamental improvement in China's national economy and better results from listed firms, coupled with general optimism stemming from China's impending recovery of Hong Kong, they said.</p>
<p>The CSRC's circular ordered local securities authorities to make risk control their key task for this year and work out concrete measures, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Exchanges and trading centres must improve their risk control mechanisms including computerised monitoring systems, the circular said.</p>
<p>Listed firms must standardise their information releases to reduce the risks to investors posed by inaccurate statements, it said.</p>
<p>The CSRC also ordered institutions involved in the markets to launch various publicity activities to help investors gain a better sense of risk.</p>
