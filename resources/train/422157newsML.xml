<p>The sluggish nature of the Australian economy through the second half of 1996 was confirmed in data released on Wednesday, but the news was overshadowed by expectations that the economy would strengthen through 1997.</p>
<p>The outlook for stronger growth was matched by an equally favourable inflation outlook that suggested official rates will remain on hold at 6.0 percent for some time to come.</p>
<p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose by 0.5 percent in the December quarter, broadly in line with expectations, to be 3.1 percent over 1996, offical data showed. This is well below the 5.0 percent growth for the year to March 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The national accounts really only confirmed what we already knew -- that the economy spent most of 1996 growing only slightly, albeit after a strong start,&quot; Bankers Trust Australia chief economist Chris Caton said.</p>
<p>The data extended Australia's record run of uninterrrupted growth to 22 quarters, dating back to September 1991.</p>
<p>Apart from the modest rise in the fourth quarter, earlier data was also revised, with the net impact being a more accurate reflection of the growth profile in 1996, economists said.</p>
<p>September quarter GDP rose 0.6 percent and the June quarter was up 0.3 percent, well down from the strong start to the year represented by the 1.6 percent growth of the March quarter. The moderation from the middle of the year saw annual growth ease from 5.0 percent in March to the current 3.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;What you have is the year-to number is now 3.1 percent, with three very subdued quarters...broadly consistent with the general tone of the economy through that period,&quot; said Rothschild Australia chief economist Ric Simes.</p>
<p>It was in that period that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates on three occasions by a total of 150 points to the current level of 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The December quarter will most likely have been the low point in the mid-cycle slowdown, with growth expected to strengthen through calendar year 1997,&quot; said Societe Generale economist Glenn Maguire. Recent strength in partial indicators such as employment, retail sales, building approvals and business investment were all seen as positive signs for 1997 growth, Treasurer Peter Costello noted after the release of the data.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say to you the economy is strengthening. I don't think that is questioned by anybody,&quot; Costello told reporters.</p>
<p>The stronger growth prospects were matched by a favourable inflation outlook, which was confirmed in the GDP data.</p>
<p>The expenditure based price deflator, a broad-based measure of inflation pressures, rose 0.4 percent in the quarter to be 1.7 percent over calendar 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The deflators fit in with the notion that inflation is under control for a while,&quot; Rothschild's Simes said.</p>
<p>Australia's inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 1.5 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Economists said that while the stronger growth outlook had all but ended hopes for a fourth cut in official interest rates, the low inflation outlook meant a rise in rates was some time away, possibly not until 1998.</p>
<p>Bankers Trust's Caton said the early signs were consistent with the view that growth could rise to four percent or higher by year end, something that should not concern policy makers given the expected benign inflation performance.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to expect the next move in rates will be upwards, but probably not until 1998,&quot; BT's Caton said.</p>
