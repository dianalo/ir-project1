<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court says states must give resident Moroccans benefits.</title>
<headline>Court says states must give resident Moroccans benefits.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1996-10-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice said on Thursday member states must recognise the Cooperation Agreement between Morocco and the EU by giving social security benefits to Moroccans living in the EU.</p>
<p>The spouse of a Moroccan pensioner, also of Moroccan nationality, applied for old-age benefits in the Netherlands when she reached 65. She was granted paritial benefits, but argued she was eligible for full benefits.</p>
<p>The woman argued that the agreement between Morocco and the EU required that she be treated as a Dutch resident for purposes of old-age benefit determination.</p>
<p>The court agreed and said, &quot;it follows from the principle of freedom from any discrimination based on nationality in the field of social security, embodied in the Agreement, that the spouse of a Moroccan migrant worker, who lives in the member state in which the worker was employed and who satisfies all the conditions, save that of nationality, for receipt in that country of a benefit...cannot be denied that benefit on grounds of nationality.&quot;</p>

<p>Reference from the Centrale Raad van Beroep (Netherlands) for a preliminary ruling in the proceedings pending before that court between</p>
<p>A. Hallouzi-Choho</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Besturr van de Sociale Verzekeringsbank</p>
<p>on the interpretation of article 41(1) of the Cooperation Agreement between the EEC and the Kingdom of Morocco, signed in Rabat on 27 April 1976 and concluded on behalf of the Community by Council regulation (EEC) No 2211/78 of 26 September 1978 (OJ 1978 L 264), p. 1)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE COURT hereby rules</p>
<p>Article 41(1) of the Cooperation Agreement between the EEC and the Kingdom of Morocco, signed in Rabat on 27 April 1976 and concluded on behalf of the Community by Council regulation (EEC) No 2211/78 of 26 September 1978, is to be interpreted as precluding a member state from refusing, on the ground that the person concerned is of Moroccan nationality, to grant benefits such as the transitional benefits established by the AOW, which are provided for by its legislation in the case of nationals who satisfy certain residence conditions in that state, to the spouse of a Moroccan worker who fulfils such residence conditions.</p>
