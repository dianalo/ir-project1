<p>A key industry official said Friday he is fed up with the &quot;quagmire&quot; of &quot;pay-to-play,&quot; disclosure, and other rules for the municipal bond market emanating from Washington.</p>
<p>Michael McCarthy, managing director of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., and vice chairman of the Public Securities Association, told bond dealers meeting here this week that many of the goals behind recent rules out of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, Securities and Exchange Commission and National Association of Securities Dealers are &quot;laudible.&quot;</p>
<p>He was speaking at an annual meeting of PSA The Bond Market Trade Association here.</p>
<p>But, McCarthy said that some are a nightmare to comply with, some are very costly, and some simply do not work. He stressed that those views are his own and not necessarily those of Goldman.</p>
<p>&quot;(Municipal) disclosure probably has gotten worse, not better&quot; since the SEC in November 1994 approved tough new primary and secondary disclosure standards for the market, McCarthy said. That is the case even though dealers and issuers are paying &quot;significant compliance costs&quot; to get systems in place.</p>
<p>The reason is that most municipalities are narrowing the amount of information they are releasing to investors to a set of mandatory disclosure items listed in the 1994 rule, he said.</p>
<p>And some of the nationally recognized repositories that collect information from localities have flawed systems that are missing many deals, he said.</p>
<p>McCarthy said the MSRB's pay-to-play rule G-37, which restricts dealers' political contributions to state and local officials, &quot;has worked extremely well&quot; in curbing improper gift giving.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) it has turned into a quagmire of interpretations and questions and is a nearly impossible compliance burden,&quot; McCarthy said.</p>
<p>Dealers in the audience complained that the rule has no escape clause for firms with strong compliance programs that have an employee who inadvertently gives an improper contribution.</p>
<p>It is particularly unfair since more egregious violations are probably going unnoticed at firms that do less monitoring, the dealers said.</p>
<p>McCarthy said dealers were barraged by regulators recently with &quot;two really massive requests for documentation&quot; on compliance with MSRB rule G-36, which requires dealers to send official statements to the board within strict timeframes. OSs are then made available to investors over the board's electronic library.</p>
<p>&quot;First there was NASD, now there there is SEC. It seems that these two parties are supposed to work somewhat together,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>McCarthy said he is unsure whether industry participants are making use of broad price transparency data that dealers now must make available under new MSRB rules. &quot;Maybe it will change when all the data is out there, but I'm not sure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>McCarthy said dealers also are burdened by SEC and NASD probes into &quot;yield burning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;SEC has been investigating firms, that's fine,&quot; he said. &quot;Now joining the frenzy&quot; is the NASD, he said, referring to an announcement this week that NASD investigators nationwide also are looking into the practice.</p>
<p>&quot;It just seems overall to become quite a burden. It's hard to seen the benefits to investors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>McCarthy stressed that regulators goals' generally are &quot;quite laudible,&quot; including improved primary and secondary disclosure. &quot;And pay-to-play had to go,&quot; he said.</p>
