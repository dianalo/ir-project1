<p>Burma's military government has removed barricades blocking access to the road past democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's house after five days of closure, a source at Suu Kyi's house said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The roadblocks were just removed,&quot; the source said in a telephone interview. &quot;You are also the first person to get through on the phone for days.&quot;</p>
<p>Suu Kyi had gone out to a meeting was not available for comment, he added.</p>
<p>The government set up roadblocks on Saturday to stop democracy supporters from attending a regular weekend speech at Suu Kyi's home on University Avenue.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi's telephone also has been out of order the past few days, with the line apparently cut.</p>
<p>The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council has said Suu Kyi's weekend speeches are illegal unless they are held inside her compound. It has prevented her from holding them since late September by blocking access to University Avenue.</p>
<p>Authorities detained at least a dozen people late last Sunday who were trying to attend her weekend speech, witnesses and a senior government official said later.</p>
