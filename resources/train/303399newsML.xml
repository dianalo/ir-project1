<p>At least eight government soldiers were killed when an army tractor was blown up by a Tamil rebel landmine in Sri Lanka's north on Sunday, military officials said.</p>
<p>Ten soldiers were wounded in the mine explosion at Kachchai, in the northern Jaffna peninsula, 320 km (200 miles) north of the capital Colombo, the officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>In continued violence in the north over the weekend, the rebels killed five soldiers in a pre-dawn raid on Sunday against army defences at Chettikulam in the Vavuniya district, 240 km (150 miles) north of Colombo.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) made a major assault on the northern army base at Paranthan, which left 350 LTTE guerrillas and 161 soldiers killed, according to the Defence Ministry.</p>
<p>The rebels said they lost 140 fighters, including 78 women, in the attack, which involved the fiercest fighting since September.</p>
<p>Paranthan is a key road-junction town just south of Jaffna.</p>
<p>The rebels on Sunday tried to hand over through the International Committee of the Red Cross what they said were the remains of 27 soldiers killed in the Paranthan battle, but the army refused to accept the bodies, saying they were difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Paranthan was the first military base to come under attack this year by the rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of the predominantly Sinhalese Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>The rebels had declared two days of mourning for their dead in the Paranthan battle, in which 20 rebel leaders died, military officials said.</p>
<p>Up to 700 rebels and more than 200 soldiers were wounded in the Paranthan battle, the Defence Ministry said.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the 14-year conflict. The LTTE says the toll is much higher.</p>
