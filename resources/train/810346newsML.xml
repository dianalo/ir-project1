<p>Japan's Kao Corp said on Tuesday it plans to boost annual sales of its chemical products by more than 20 percent to some 180 billion yen by March 2001.</p>
<p>The leading maker of home products such as detergents and cosmetics said it would do this by boosting output capacity at its domestic plants by investing a total of four billion yen.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to strengthen the chemical products department as a pillar of our business as a whole, and at the same time improve our technology for our own consumer products,&quot; a Kao spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>In the year to March 1997, Kao's sales of chemical products totalled about 150 billion yen, about 16 percent of its total sales for the year, he said.</p>
<p>The company plans to spend two billion yen to double annual production capacity at its aroma chemical plant in Wakayama, central Japan, to 4,000 tonnes from the present 2,000 tonnes by spring 1998, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Aroma chemicals are used in soaps and other perfumed products.</p>
<p>Kao plans to invest another two billion yen at its plant in Ibaraki, northeast of Tokyo, to increase output of non-ionic surfactants used in detergents to 60,000 tonnes a year from the current 40,000 tonnes by spring 1998, he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Kao would boost exports of aroma chemicals, mainly to Southeast Asia, where demand is growing rapidly, but declined to comment on the amount it plans to export. - Tokyo equities desk (813) 3432-9404</p>
