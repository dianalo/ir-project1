<p>A man arrested for a series of killings and robberies that spread alarm in Shanghai has confessed to the crimes, a police spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old man from the province of Anhui, northwest of Shanghai, was picked up on Wednesday and charged in connection with 13 attacks on women in which two died and 12 were injured.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a breakthrough,&quot; the police spokesman said in an interview with Shanghai Television news. &quot;He has confessed to the crimes.&quot;</p>
<p>The killer used an iron bar to attack his victims and then robbed of them of cash and valuables.</p>
<p>The official media made no mention of the case until the arrest was made, but Shanghai's 13 million residents more than made up for the media silence by circulating rumours that dominated conversations in the city for more than a week.</p>
