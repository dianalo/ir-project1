<p>Miami Beach plans five bond issues totalling up to $88 million in the next six months or so, city Finance Director Robert Nachlinger said Monday.</p>
<p>Pricing is expected in early December on a $15 million general obligation bond issue, with Smith Barney Inc as senior manager.</p>
<p>Filling out the syndicate are Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, William R. Hough &amp; Co and PaineWebber Inc, which make up one of the city's two standing underwriter teams.</p>
<p>A $15 million parking revenue bond issue is expected to price in early January. Underwriters include Bear Stearns &amp; Co Inc, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co Inc, AIBC Investment Services Corp, and Raymond James &amp; Assiociates Inc. They comprise the city's second standing team, but it was unclear which would be senior manager on the deal.</p>
<p>Pricing is expected in early February on an $18 million stormwater improvment revenue bond issue, with William R. Hough as senior manager.</p>
<p>A tax increment revenue bond of $20 million to $25 million is scheduled for pricing in March with AIBC as senior manager. It will finance redevelopment of the city's South Pointe neighborhood at the southern tip of Miami Beach.</p>
<p>The last issue, a $15 million tax revenue bond of the City Center Redevelopment Area, is still tentative. Pricing is expected in the spring, with Morgan Stanely as senior manager. The issue will help finance a 400-room hotel south of the city's convention center.</p>
<p>Additionally, city commissioners have given conceptual approval for two $40 million loan projects, both of which will be financed through state municipal pools, Nachlinger said.</p>
<p>One would offer 20-year loans to high-rise apartment and condominium owners to finance installation of sprinklers. The sprinklers were mandated under a 1991 fire code change, but the city has delayed enforcement. Some 71 buildings over 70 feet tall still lack sprinklers and would be eligible for the loans.</p>
<p>The second project is a $40 million revolving pool to finance work to bury electric lines, gas lines, and fiber-optic cable for television, telephone and internet transmission. Burying the lines underground would reduce damage in the event of another major hurricane, a lesson learned when Hurricane Andrew destroyed the entire above-ground electric grid in some communities south of Miami in 1992, Nachlinger said.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite frankly it's probably a $200 million program just for Miami Beach,&quot; Nachlinger said.</p>
<p>Both of the loans would be covenent debt repaid through annual appropriations, he said.</p>
