<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-hardaway sends stoudamire a lesson as heat beat raptors.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tim Hardaway scored 26 points and sent a message to Toronto's second-year guard Damon Stoudamire as the Miami Heat beat the Raptors 99-87 Thursday.</p>
<p>Sasha Danilovic added 16 and he and Hardaway combined for 11 points during a key run spanning the third and fourth quarters as the Heat continued their strong play on the road, winning for the fifth time in their last six games and pushing their record away from home to 20-5, best in the NBA.</p>
<p>Walt Williams had 23 points for Toronto and has 56 in his last two games. Stoudamire added 22 and 11 assists, but was bothered by Hardaway's defence, hitting just 7-of-20 shots.</p>
<p>For Hardaway, the game meant a little more than usual after Stoudamire criticised his ability in a published report.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to make a statement,&quot; Hardaway said. &quot;I went at Damon a little bit harder. In the first half I pressed a little too hard but in the second half I just took it to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We made a couple of mistakes and they made us pay,&quot; Stoudamire said. &quot;They are a good ballclub and every time we had a letdown they capitalised. Tim played well, but I wasn't guarding him. When I was on him, I thought I played him well.&quot;</p>
<p>The game was the 17th straight in which the Heat have held an opponent under 100 points and the 23rd time in 41 games that Miami has held a foe under 90.</p>
<p>At Cleveland, Michael Jordan scored 13 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter and keyed a 19-4 run that blew the game open as the Chicago Bulls defeated the Cavaliers 87-71.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a hard-fought win,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;We were able to hold them off in the second half and I was able to get some easy baskets in the fourth quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Jordan made 10-of-24 shots and was 11-of-12 from the foul line following his 51-point effort Tuesday against New York.</p>
<p>Terrell Brandon scored all of his 21 points in the first three quarters and Chris Mills added 20 for the Cavaliers, who have dropped eight of their last nine.</p>
<p>In Anaheim, Darrick Martin scored 31 points, including three free throws with 16.2 seconds left that put Los Angeles ahead to stay, and the Clippers held on for their first win over the Seattle SuperSonics in nearly three years, 102-100.</p>
<p>Malik Sealy added 21 points for Los Angeles, which broke a 14-game losing streak against the SuperSonics, beating them for the first time since January 25, 1994.</p>
<p>The loss also ended Seattle's overall nine-game winning streak. Shawn Kemp had 26 points and 11 rebounds and Gary Payton added 22 points before being ejected in the final seconds for the Sonics, who lost for just the third time in 17 games.</p>
<p>The Clippers scored the game's final six points.</p>
<p>In Houston, Sam Mack, starting for the ailing Mario Elie, scored a season-high 20 points as the Rockets raced to a 16-point halftime lead and held off the New Jersey Nets 111-106.</p>
<p>Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler added 20 points apiece for Houston, which won for the fifth time in six games. The Rockets posted their eighth straight win over the Nets.</p>
<p>Olajuwon, who also had 10 rebounds, fell two assists shy of a triple-double as he and Drexler each had eight assists.</p>
<p>Kevin Willis added 16 points and 15 rebounds for the Rockets, who were without Elie and forward Charles Barkley. Elie had the flu, while Barkley missed his fourth straight game with a sprained right ankle.</p>
<p>At Indiana, Patrick Ewing scored 23 points, including the go-ahead basket with 17 seconds remaining, as the New York Knicks averted a Reggie Miller-led comeback and defeated the Pacers 92-90.</p>
<p>Chris Childs had 16 points and eight assists for the Knicks, who have won 17 of the last 21 regular-season meetings with Indiana.</p>
<p>Travis Best finished with 22 points and Miller scored 10 of his 21 in the fourth quarter for the Pacers.</p>
<p>In Orlando, Derek Strong scored eight of his 14 points in the final four minutes and grabbed 11 rebounds as as the Magic beat the Milwaukee Bucks 96-92.</p>
<p>Penny Hardaway and Rony Seikaly had 23 apiece for Orlando, which won for the sixth time in seven games. The Magic, who lost the first two games with the Bucks this season, beat them for the 10th time in the last 13 meetings.</p>
<p>Tom Gugliotta scored a season-high 33 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves won for the first time in Vancouver, defeating the Grizzlies 95-76.</p>
<p>Gugliotta, who scored 18 points on 9-of-11 shooting in the first quarter, also grabbed 15 rebounds.</p>
<p>At Golden State, Terry Mills had 22 points and Lindsey Hunter added 19 as the Detroit Pistons snapped a modest two-game slide by routing the Warriors 94-79.</p>
<p>Latrell Sprewell led Golden State with 18 points and Donyell Marshall and Joe Smith added 17 apiece.</p>
