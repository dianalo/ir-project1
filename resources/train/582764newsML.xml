<title>USA: Coffee prices hit 11-year high, grains fall.</title>
<headline>Coffee prices hit 11-year high, grains fall.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Coffee futures closed at their highest price in 11 years on Wednesday as speculators and panicky commercial coffee firms continued to buy on worries about tight supplies now and later this year.</p>
<p>At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for May delivery rose to a new life-of-contract high at 270.00 cents a pound and closed up one-half cent at 261.50 cents, the highest closing price since March 1986.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just a profit-taking day,&quot; said Stephen Smith, president of South Futures in Miami. &quot;But the trend is clearly up, and people are very scared to sell it.&quot;</p>
<p>Smaller-than-expected crops in many Latin American coountries -- notably number two coffee producer Colombia -- and low inventory levels in consuming countries have helped fuel coffee futures' steep five-month upswing.</p>
<p>According to official figures made available Wednesday by Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation, the country produced 2.7 million bags of coffee between January and April against 3.7 million bags in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Each bag contains 132 pounds of coffee.</p>
<p>The figures came a day after Jorge Cardenas, the federation's general manager, told reporters that the federation was having &quot;enormous difficulties&quot; meeting its export commitments because of unusually tight supplies.</p>
<p>The onset of winter in Brazil, the world's top coffee grower, is also keeping traders on edge. A frost in Brazil three years ago sent prices soaring.</p>
<p>Smith said traders would closely watch a monthly stocks report from the Green Coffee Association of New York that is due out on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Many traders expect the report to show U.S. stockpiles of coffee rose some 100,000 bags in April. But estimates range widely from a slight decrease to a 300,000-bag increase.</p>
<p>Last month, the association said stocks of coffee stored in U.S. warehouses rose by 111,000 bags in March to 1,657,000 bags. In April 1996, stocks fell 76,000 bags to 2,296,000 bags.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean prices led grains lower as speculators bailed out of the market. Soybeans for May delivery fell 11-1/4 cents a bushel to close at $8.69.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a growing feeling that the market stubbed its toe last week at $9.00,&quot; said Bob Lekberg, analyst with Goldenberg-Hehmeyer. &quot;There is obviously considerable uncertainty at these higher levels. The expectation is for some pretty low numbers on the exports tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said they expected a weekly report by the Agriculture Department due on Thursday morning to show net exports of 100,000 to 200,000 metric tons of soybeans last week. But some cited rumblings that the figure may be much lower on cancellations of orders due to soaring U.S. prices.</p>
<p>Soybeans hit an 8-1/2 year high at $9.03-1/2 on May 7.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork belly prices rose on news that meatpacker IBP Inc would cut back the hours at its Midwest slaughter plants due to poor profit margins. Pork bellies are used to produce bacon.</p>
<p>Pork bellies for May delivery rose 1.425 cents a pound to 87.375 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Continued processing overcapacity and tight hog supplies have prompted IBP to further reduce hours at all of its pork plants,&quot; the meatpacker said in a statement. &quot;Market conditions are out of balance. Demand for pork is not strong enough to support current live hog price levels,&quot; IBP said.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil prices ended with slim gains after expected heavy selling did not carry through on news that U.S. stockpiles of crude oil were much higher than expected.</p>
<p>Crude oil for June delivery ended two cents higher at $21.39 a barrel after falling as low as $20.85.</p>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute in a weekly report issued on Tuesday said crude oil stocks in the United States grew a whopping 6.94 million barrels in the week ended May 9. Traders had expected a rise of one million barrels.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally, the APIs were bearish. What happened was there was, after a while, a lack of followthrough to the downside, so shorts started to cover,&quot; said John Saucer, an analyst with Smith Barney in Houston.</p>
<p>API also said U.S. gasoline stocks grew 6.51 million barrels last week. Traders again had expected a rise of only a one million barrels. Distillate stocks, comprised of heating oil and diesel, dropped 1.10 million barrels when dealers had expected a rise. But, with heating oil out of season, it did not benefit from the data, dealers said.</p>
<p>June heating oil closed 0.06 cent a gallon lower at 56.42 cents and June unleaded gasoline ended 0.38 cent a gallon lower at 64.38 cents.</p>
