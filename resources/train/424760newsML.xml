<p>Austria's top economic research body Wifo said on Thursday it is sticking to its forecast that Austria's economy would grow by a real 1.2 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot offer you something better at moment&quot;, Wifo chief Helmut Kramer told a conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>Wifo, on whose forecasts the Austrian government bases its policies, has forecast next year's growth of gross domestic product (GDP) at 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) earlier on Thursday forecast GDP growth at 1.4 percent this year and at 2.3 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>Kramer said growth was backed by exports which were expected to grow six percent this year.</p>
<p>Austria's economy would continue to depend heavily on Germany, he said, adding that recent fourth-quarter data had not supported the assumption that the German economy would pick up in 1997.</p>
<p>Wifo expects the German economy to grow by between two and 2.5 percent this year, he said.</p>
<p>Kramer also warned against postponing the start of Europe's planned economic and monetary union (EMU). &quot;I doubt whether a structured delay would be possible&quot;, he said, and forecast grave turbulences on financial markets if the project was delayed.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of a single currency would probably be discredited for years&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>In a study released last week, Wifo said the single currency would bring Austria additional growth of up to 2.25 percent over a five-year period.</p>
<p>&quot;EMU is an investment in Europe's future&quot;, Kramer said. -- Christian Gutlederer, Vienna newsroom  +431 53112-275</p>
