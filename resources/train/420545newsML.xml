<p>Cocoa futures recovered their nerve in afternoon dealings on Wednesday following a new spate of technical short covering, but prices retreated from their peaks.</p>
<p>Benchmark May cocoa reached a nearly three month high of 945 stg per tonne after crossing smoothly the initial 938 stg barrier, but the close below this initial resistance level was somewhat discouraging for longs.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a bit disappointing that it closed below 938,&quot; said one trader. He described sentiment as &quot;mixed&quot; after a surge of 80 stg or almost ten percent since last week, mainly on the back of improving chart picture.</p>
<p>May ended the day at 933 stg, up three stg, while further forwards recorded gains of up to 13 stg. Turnover totalled 11,007 lots, of which May grabbed a hefty 5,825.</p>
<p>The May structure was tightening with May/Dec trading at 33 stg but on the closing call the May/July came out to 14 stg from 11 during the day, traders said.</p>
<p>The market had a hesistant start absorbing early hedges, but the ensuing rally helped tighten the arbitrage against New York as stop losses were triggered at 938, traders said.</p>
<p>Although technically the market should look to extent gains to the December high of 942 some players were sceptical, saying more fundamental clues were needed to justify the rally.</p>
<p>But these were absent, especially with prospects for the Ivorian midcrop now looking better after weather experts forecast showers in cocoa areas at the end of this week.</p>
<p>Another setback remained to be lack of aggressive industry buying.</p>
<p>German cocoa traders said they were not convinced by the technical reversal of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as buyers are concerned there is plenty of cocoa around and the fundamentals are unchanged,&quot; said one trader.</p>
