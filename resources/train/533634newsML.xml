<p>---------------------- April 23 -------------------------</p>
<p>* Volume drops to 6.53 bln pesos from 16.85 bln</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Manila overnight money was stuck at 10.03125 percent on Wednesday due to excess cash in the system despite remittances by banks for tax payments, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, banks flocked to the secondary market of government securities and fixed-rate treasury notes. The market was very, very active,&quot; said a trader in a foreign bank.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some banks are now betting that the market would not tighten even after the transfer of an additional 10 billion pesos in tax payments to the government next week,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Volume dropped to 6.53 billion pesos from Tuesday's 16.85 billion. Lenders outpaced borrowers 20 to 17.</p>
<p>Traders said there was increased demand for one-year treasury bills in the secondary market following Tuesday's successful maiden 20-year bond auction.  </p>
<p>There was also demand for three, seven and 10 year fixed rate treasury notes in the secondary market.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of six banks showed three-month T-bills were bid at 10.25 to 10.375 percent and offered at 10.2 to 10.275 percent, six month bills at 10.6 to 10.725 per cent and offered at 10.5 to 10.625 percent, and one-year bills at 11.1 to 11.25 percent and offered at 11 to 11.15 percent.</p>
