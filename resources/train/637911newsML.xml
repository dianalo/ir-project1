<p>The bodies of two Austrian U.N. soldiers shot dead on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights last week were flown to Austria on Wednesday, a U.N. spokesman said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters that investigations into the killing of Warrant Officer Wolfgang Grasser and Master Corporal Gerhard Karitschnig were still going on and no firm conclusions had been reached so far.</p>
<p>The bodies of the two, who were serving with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Forces (UNDOF) stationed on the Golan Heights between Syria and Israel, were found last Friday on the Syrian side, he said.</p>
<p>Autopsies conducted on the bodies at a Damascus hospital had proved the two were killed by shooting.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation is still going on and we will issue a press release as soon as we reach any firm results,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The U.N. official said the Austrians were shot while on foot patrol on the Syrian side of the Golan.</p>
<p>There was no official reaction from Syria but the Israeli army said its troops were not involved.</p>
<p>An Israeli security source said the killings occurred in an area in which smugglers between Syria and Lebanon are active.</p>
<p>U.N. sources expressed surprise at the incident which was rare in the history of UNDOF which deployed in the area in 1974 following the 1973 Middle East war.</p>
<p>The U.N. force serves as a buffer between Syrian and Israeli forces.</p>
<p>&quot;The Golan is one of the quietest areas in the world where the United Nations forces are deployed. We have not witnessed such an incidents in many years and what happened was rare,&quot; a U.N. official said.</p>
<p>Austria has more than 400 soldiers in the 1,050-strong force.</p>
