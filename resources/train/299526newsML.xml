<title>SPAIN: Spanish Socialist centre attacked, one man hurt.</title>
<headline>Spanish Socialist centre attacked, one man hurt.</headline>
<dateline>SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hooded attackers threw petrol bombs into a Socialist Party centre in Spain's Basque region on Friday, starting a fire that slightly injured one man, police said.</p>
<p>Several people were inside the party building in the northern Basque town of Hernani, a hotbed of support for the militant Basque separatist group ETA, when the group attacked.  </p>
<p>A 48-year-old man was taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, but apparently was not seriously hurt, police said. Firefighters later extinguished the blaze.</p>
<p>The attack follows Thursday's arrests of several members of a violent youth group, one of several that support ETA by attacking official buildings, banks and buses.</p>
<p>Spain's Interior Minister issued a warning earlier in the week that ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom), which has killed some 800 people in its 28-year drive for Basque independence, would strike in retaliation for recent youth group arrests.</p>
<p>Officials said ETA was responsible for the shooting death of an army officer on Wednesday in Madrid.</p>
