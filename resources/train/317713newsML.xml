<p>The lure of gold beneath a canopy of rain-forest on Borneo Island and the involvement of a Who's Who of Indonesian power brokers have propelled a small Canadian mining company into world headlines.</p>
<p>Gold deposits were first found in the Busang area in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province on Borneo 10 years ago. But it was only in the last 18 months that the huge size of the lode -- one of the world's biggest -- was revealed.</p>
<p>Bre-X Minerals Ltd, a small Calgary-based exploration company, estimates there are at least 57 million ounces of gold, currently worth over $21 billion, in its three Busang claims.</p>
<p>Moves by Bre-X to find a partner to extract the gold in the rain forest and rugged hills of Borneo has led to confusion, power plays and fears among international mining firms that Indonesia's good reputation in the industry may be marred.</p>
<p>Bre-X, under Indonesian government pressure, is in the process of teaming up with the world's third-biggest gold miner, Canada's Barrick Gold Corp, to develop the find, with 22.5 percent going to Bre-X, 67.5 percent to Barrick, and the remaining 10 percent going to the Indonesian government.</p>
<p>Ironically, Barrick has retrieved its position in Busang after joint-venture proposals with Bre-X fell through in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;We like to call it the best deal we never did,&quot; Bre-X vice-president Steve McAnulty said in February last year before Barrick -- with ambitions to become the world's biggest gold miner -- moved back in.</p>
<p>The effect of the find on Bre-X has been spectacular. It shot from a stock price of C$2.00 in 1995 to C$192.50 at its listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in April last year before splitting 10-for-one. It traded at C$24.40 last Friday.</p>
<p>Another major Canadian company, Placer Dome Inc, is also trying to get a piece of the Busang pie through a $5 billion merger proposal with Bre-X. Indonesian government sources say Jakarta is opposed.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry, meanwhile, has given Bre-X and Barrick a month in which to sort out details with their local partners, a top ministry source said on Saturday.</p>
<p>These include the eldest son and eldest daughter of President Suharto, timber tycoon Muhammad &quot;Bob&quot; Hasan, who is a close Suharto associate and golfing partner, and U.S.-educated Indonesian businessman Jusuf Merukh.</p>
<p>Merukh claims 40 percent of Busang and has launched a C$2.0 billion lawsuit against Bre-X in Canada.</p>
<p>The government's involvement in pushing Bre-X into an alliance with Barrick has raised fears among international firms that doing business in Indonesia may become more complicated, particularly if the huge sums of money involved catch the eye of the country's power elite.</p>
<p>The Busang find has also sparked a second gold rush in Indonesia, which has ambitions of becoming one of the world's biggest producers within a few years.</p>
<p>Gold production jumped to 63 tonnes in 1995 and 36.5 tonnes in the first half of 1996 from only 15.9 tonnes in 1991.</p>
<p>Mining analysts say prospects are bright for Indonesia as gold production in the two top producers, the United States and South Africa, starts to decline.</p>
