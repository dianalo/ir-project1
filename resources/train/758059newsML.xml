<p>Bombay stocks went on a roller-coaster ride on Friday as traders spent the session interpreting political developments that were likely to affect the stability of the ruling 15-party coalition government.</p>
<p>&quot;The uncertain political scenario has pulled down the market,&quot; said Anand Bhatt, dealer at YSN Shares &amp; Securities Pvt Ltd. &quot;Unless the political scene gets clear, I don't see the market going anywhere.&quot;  </p>
<p>The scandal-tainted chief minister of India's eastern state of Bihar said on Friday he was resigning from his post, but immediately named his wife as his successor.</p>
<p>Laloo Prasad Yadav resigned less than an hour after India's Supreme Court ordered that he could not be arrested despite arrest warrants issued against him and three other politicians by a special investigative court.</p>
<p>The crisis has sharply divided the country's ruling United Front coalition, whose leaders put off until Friday evening a meeting on whether or not to allow Yadav's breakaway group to remain in its fold.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, news that a special court had issued an arrest warrant against Yadav led to a reaction in share prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market will slide further on fears of political turmoil,&quot; said Sanjay Vaid, chief dealer at Lloyds Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Buying orders of foreign funds could be held back till the full impact is realised.&quot;</p>
<p>Yadav's resignation came just as the market closed and dealers said the market outlook would now depend on the political effect of that move. &quot;The key thing now is to be glued to politics,&quot; a local dealer quipped.</p>
