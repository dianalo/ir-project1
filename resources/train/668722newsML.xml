<p>A banned Corsican separatist group has suspended its violent campaign for more autonomy from Paris to give France's new leftist government time to set its policy, a Corsican newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Historic Wing of the Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) announced at a news conference on Monday it was calling a truce for a &quot;significant period of time&quot;, but it gave no specific deadline, the Corsican edition of the regional daily La Provence said.</p>
<p>The truce was announced by a group of 10 armed and hooded representatives of the FLNC-Historic Wing at a secret location on the Mediterranean island, it said.</p>
<p>The FLNC has frequently staged clandestine news conferences, transporting journalists to remote sites, hooded or in cars with screened windows.</p>
<p>An FLNC spokesman said the group wanted to give the new French government &quot;the time it needs to review the Corsica file and determine its intentions, without restrictions and without having to justify itself,&quot; the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>A leftist government took power this month after an alliance of Socialists, Communists and Greens upset the previous centre-right majority in a June 1 parliamentary election.</p>
<p>Corsican separatists have claimed responsibility for hundreds of bombings in their two-decade guerrilla campaign for greater autonomy from mainland France.</p>
<p>The FLNC had called a similar truce in mid-1996 while holding secret negotiations with the centre-right government.</p>
<p>But no agreement resulted from the talks and the truce was regularly broken by bomb blasts before it was finally called off in December after the government mounted an aggressive crackdown on separatist violence.</p>
<p>At Monday's news conference, the FLNC spokesman reiterated the group's traditional demands, including official recognition of the Corsican people and their language and culture, electoral and political reforms and a separate fiscal regime for their island home, the newspaper said.</p>
