<headline>McGraw Q1 publishing unit losses widen.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-15</dateline>

<p>The McGraw-Hill Cos Inc on Tuesday said revenues rose in all operating segments in the first quarter, but increased net losses in the educational publishing unit hurt the firm's overall performance.</p>
<p>First quarter revenue in the educational and professional publishing unit rose 18.7 percent to $196.9 million, including $33 million from the former Times Mirror Co properties, which offset Shepard's revenue last year of $15 million.</p>
<p>McGraw-Hill acquired the Times Mirror Higher Educational Group from Times Mirror Co in 1996 in exchange for McGraw-Hill's Shepard's, a legal publishing business.  </p>
<p>McGraw said a revenues in the financial services segment rose 10.2 percent to $234.9 million, with operating profit up 12.8 percent to $74.7 million. The company attributed the gains to the continued diversification of its Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services.</p>
<p>But it noted that investments in new products, including an Internet service for individual investors, which will be launched later this year, resulted in a modest decline in operating profit.</p>
<p>Information and Media Services revenues grew eight percent from a year ago to $221.2 million, with operating profit up 5.4 percent to $17.9 million.</p>
<p>McGraw said its Business Week magazine scored a double-digit increase in advertising pages, while broadcasting produced a gain for the quarter despite modest revenue growth.</p>
<p>It added that improved results at other publications helped offset softness in the computer and communications magazines.</p>
<p>Earlier, the firm reported first quarter earnings of $0.15 cents per share, off from $0.16 per share last year. Revenue for the period grew 11.8 percent to $652.9 million.</p>
<p>Analysts estimated McGraw's first quarter earnings at $0.14 per share, according to First Call.  </p>
<p>The unit's operating loss rose to $42.5 million from $31.4 million reflecting the recent investment in higher education.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the acquisition of the Times Mirror Higher Education Group diluted earnings in the first quarter, we are rapidly integrating these businesses with our own College Division and remain dedicated to achieving our goal of no dilution for the year,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Substantial investments (in that unit) now will help ensure good results in the third quarter,&quot; it added.</p>
