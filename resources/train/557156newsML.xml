<p>Cargolux Airlines International said it will be introducing a weekly stopover in Bogota on the return leg of its Luxembourg-Sao Paulo service, picking up flowers-only shipments, effective next week.</p>
<p>The Bogota stopover will be operated in conjunction with Colombian cargo airline, Aero TransColombia de Carga (ATC Colombia), Cargolux added.</p>
<p>&quot;We have taken a strategic decision to develop perishables traffic and introducing a stopover in Bogota, exclusively for flowers, is one example of this,&quot; Pierre Wesner, the Luxembourg-based all-cargo carrier's vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The current main source of flowers carried by Cargolux destined for the European market -- Amsterdam and London in particular -- is Kenya.</p>
<p>These shipments are transported on the return leg of a Luxembourg-Johannesburg Boeing 747-400F service which makes a weekly stopover at Nairobi, Wesner said.</p>
<p>Flowers are largely made up of carnations and roses as well as indigenous varieties.</p>
<p>Other sources of flowers carried by Cargolux are Singapore and Thailand, mostly in the form of orchids.</p>
<p>The cargo airline also ships small quantities of Netherlands-grown flowers and bulbs to Komatsu in Japan and Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;With the new Bogota stopover and taking into account the seasonal nature of this trade, we'll probably average (carrying) 50 to 60 tonnes of flowers per week in 1997, which will be a significant increase on last year,&quot; said Wesner.</p>
<p>He added flowers commanded rates a little higher than the average for perishable goods.</p>
<p>Cargolux will be one of the exhibiting companies at the International Flower Trade Show at Aalmeer in the Netherlands later this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This will be our first appearance at the exhibition and we will be occupying a 15 square-metre stand at the trade show and see it is an excellent opportunity to make contact with prospective clients,&quot; said Wesner.</p>
<p>KLM Cargo will also be occupying an exhibitors stand at the flower trade show for the first time while other exhibitors will include Martinair Cargo and forwarding groups, Schenker Eurocargo and Put Fresh Cargo, a spokeswoman for the show's organisers told Reuters.</p>
<p>The flower trade will take place at Aalmeer between November 5-9, 1997.</p>
<p>Last month, Cargolux occupied a stand for the first time at the European Seafood Exhibition in Brussels.</p>
<p>Cargolux operates a fleet of three 747-400 freighters  and is to take delivery of a further two -400Fs later this year.</p>
<p>It also operates four Boeing 747-200Fs, including one on leaseback.</p>
