<p>---------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* Canada's dollar opened stronger at C$1.3785 (US$0.7254) in light trading on Thursday after the unit rallied last night in overseas trading, traders said. * They said the Canada unit benefited from a market belief that the governing Liberals had consolidated their electoral strength days before the June 2 national ballot.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the Liberals pulling ahead slightly to 41 percent, the market has regained some confidence,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Analysts said any further polls showing a trend toward a majority Liberal government could help the Canadian dollar rally to as far as C$1.3850 (US$0.7220) later today.</p>
<p>The dollar weakened in the past two days on polls showing a growing possibility of a Liberal minority government with the Western-based Reform Party as the official opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is that the market has bought into this Toronto Star poll,&quot; said Reid Farrill, corporate foreign exchange adviser for CIBC Wood Gundy.  </p>
<p>&quot;This poll was fairly prominent,&quot; Farrill added.</p>
<p>Analysts said markets had adjusted to the slim prospect of a Liberal minority government, but would be keeping a wary eye on further polls released today.</p>
<p>The last Reuters-Zogby poll is due to be released at 1200 EDT/1600 GMT today.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst news about the Liberal slippage has already been priced in. As long as the polls show the lead is stabilizing, we should be able to basically rebound from here,&quot; said Mario Angastiniotis, economist with MMS International.  </p>
<p>Angastiniotis conceded that any poll showing further slippage in Liberal support would be a wild card for the currency and possibly prompt further weakening.</p>
<p>Overseas, the Canadian dollar gained ground at the expense of European currencies and a softer Japanese yen.</p>
<p>The French franc continued to erode on release of a poll showing the French Socialist party in striking distance of a parliamentary majority in Sunday's second round of voting.</p>
<p>The Japanese yen weakened against the U.S. dollar after Japanese officials hinted that Japan would not raise interest rates in the near future.  </p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canadian dollar rose to 84.33 yen from Wednesday's 83.81 yen and to 1.2348 marks from Wednesday's 1.2265 marks.</p>
