<p>The National Bank of Hungary's (NBH) rate cuts on Monday indicate it is confident that June inflation figures and other economic data soon to be released will be positive, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think (NBH president Gyorgy Suranyi) already knows more or less what the June inflation figure will be,&quot; said Citibank analyst Csaba Varga.</p>
<p>&quot;The June inflation figure must be very good and that may be the reason for the NBH rate cut,&quot; said brokerage Gog's securities trader Zsolt Bango. The figures are due to be released on Friday.</p>
<p>The NBH cut its one-month and one-week reverse repo rates by 25 basis points to 20.50 and 20.00 percent in the morning, then reduced its one-week and overnight repo rates by 0.25 percentage point both to 26.00 percent.</p>
<p>The rate cuts were completed by the reduction of the one-year NBH bond yield to 20.03 percent from 20.27.</p>
<p>Inflation ran at 17.7 percent in May but according to a recent Reuters poll of 12 analysts the 17-month trend of decline should be broken in June, with the forecasts averaging 17.78 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders said Suranyi's last week remarks on &quot;a cautious interest rate policy&quot; had weakened repo rate cut expectations and Monday's cuts caught a part of the market players unguarded.</p>
<p>They said that the reduction of the one-year bond yield was the most surprising as the NBH introduced these bonds three weeks ago to give support to interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a little surprising after the last week's remarks by Mr Suranyi that he expected an upward correction in short-term government securities yields,&quot; said Attila Torok of Postabank Securities.</p>
<p>But OTP Securities analyst Peter Bozso was less surprised by the rate cuts as Hungary's forint was strong, forint interest rates seemed to be high enough to attract foreign investments and demand for the NBH's one-year bond was strong at the earlier yield level of 20.27 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;A market balance can also be maintained at lower yield levels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Government securities yields rose by between 10 and 15 basis points after Suranyi's comments which followed an up-to- 80 basis points fall, but the yields almost returned to the earlier lower levels on Monday after the rate cuts.</p>
<p>Analysts said the rate cuts may bring about a fall in most discount Treasury bill yields and were likely to underline the trend of declining inflation.</p>
<p>Low agricultural prices in the comparative period of 1996 and bad weather earlier this year made a temporary rise in June and July likely, analysts said earlier.</p>
<p>The NBH said in a statement last week that inflation was likely to be between 17.4 and 17.8 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed that the rate cuts projected a stagnation or a drop in inflation in June and they said a pending revision of May household savings figures by the NBH and April current account data expected for Wednesday were likely to be positive.</p>
