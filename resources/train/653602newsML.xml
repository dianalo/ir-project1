<p>California's governor planned Thursday to sign legislation paving the way for the state to sue major tobacco companies to recoup public health-care costs related to smoking, his office said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Pete Wilson will sign the bill at a news conference in Los Angeles and will call on the state's attorney general, Dan Lungren, to file California's lawsuit immediately, said Wilson's spokeswoman, Lisa Kalustian.</p>
<p>&quot;This is certainly important for the state of California,&quot; Kalustian said. &quot;The governor's going to sign this bill tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>State sources said Lungren, also a Republican, would comply with the governor's request and could file the lawsuit as early as Thursday.</p>
<p>California, the most populous state, with billions of dollars in potential claims, has so far not sued major tobacco companies. But pressure has been building on state lawmakers in recent months to join the legal battle.</p>
<p>Oregon and Idaho sued the tobacco industry Tuesday, bringing to 36 the number of states seeking restitution for health care spending related to illness allegedly caused by smoking.</p>
<p>Lungren has long asserted that a state lawsuit against tobacco companies would fail because of a 1987 California law shielding them from product liability claims.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, state Assembly Speaker Cruz Bustamante introduced legislation to remove the barrier, allowing Lungren to sue tobacco companies to recover state-paid medical costs of treating smokers.</p>
<p>The state Senate and Assembly both approved the bill last week, sending it to Wilson for review.</p>
<p>Once signed into law by Wilson, Bustamante's legislation would take effect immediately.</p>
