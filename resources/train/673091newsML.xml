<p>The District of Columbia's fiscal house cleaning efforts appear to be paying off in higher investor confidence and lower borrowing costs, a District official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are committed to continuing those improvements so that the investments that you have made in the past will become more valuable, and that you will continue to be interested in investing in the District's recovery/turnaround,&quot; Thomas Huestis, D.C.'s deputy chief financial officer for Finance and Treasurer, said Wednesday during The Bond Buyer's Investor Forum here.</p>
<p>Back in 1995, the District's debt was down-graded to non-investment grade. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp currently rates the District's debt single-B, while Moody's Investors Service assigns a Ba and Fitch Investors Service assigns a double-B, Huestis said.</p>
<p>After the downgrade, the District was forced to rely on U.S. Treasury borrowing to fund all its capital and cash flow needs, he said.</p>
<p>But as some of the reforms initiated by District Chief Financial Officer Anthony Williams began to take effect and investors regained some confidence, D.C. decided it could tap the market again. When it entered the market in July 1996 with a negotiated sale only two firms responded to its solicitation for underwriters.</p>
<p>&quot;Credit enhancement was not available for us at that point at all at reasonable rates, and then we ended up borrowing at about a little over 5.0 percent for our all-in yield on a less than three-month loan,&quot; Huestis said. &quot;So that was our start.&quot;</p>
<p>The District's second entry in October 1996 marked the its first long-term financing since the downgrade. It was required to be done as a competitive deal under the Home Rule Act, the District's charter established by Congress.</p>
<p>Four underwriting syndicates bid, and the deal was won at a true interest cost of about 6.5 percent. Huestis estimated that the deal was done at about 105 to 170 basis points over triple-A insured bonds. It was uninsured because insurance &quot;was not available to us at all,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>On its next competitive GO sale, both AMBAC Indemnity Corp and MBIA Insurance Corp agreed to insure the whole issue. MBIA agreed even though it had about $2 billion of exposure to DC issues, he said.</p>
<p>This time, six underwriting groups bid on the transaction, and Lehman won with a 6.073 percent TIC, closely followed by the cover bid.</p>
<p>&quot;There was extreme competition on this sale,&quot; Huestis said, adding that District's uninsured bonds were now at a premium of roughly 50 basis points over the triple-A insured scale.</p>
<p>&quot;So we were able to cut our premium in half from the financing that was down in October,&quot; the Deputy CFO said, comparing the long end of each deal. &quot;Again, we viewed this as more confidence in the financial improvements that we have been making.&quot;</p>
<p>Next week, the District plans two short-term sales. On Wednesday, D.C. is set to sell $200 million of tax and revenue anticipation notes and $74 million of GO budget notes.</p>
<p>Six banks submitted proposals for credit enhancement, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The firms submitted very aggressive facility fees in the range of 50 to 60 basis points, which we compared to the 80 basis points of a couple of months ago,&quot; Huestis said.</p>
<p>He explained that earlier this year D.C. had a letter of credit extended at a facility fee of 80 basis points, which, at the time, it considered &quot;a great, aggressive price.&quot;</p>
<p>News was also good on the underwriting front for Wednesday's deals.</p>
<p>&quot;This time we received 11 proposals from banking firms to underwrite the notes, up from two a year ago,&quot; he said. &quot;And we're real pleased with that.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, D.C. plans a $50 million equipment lease financing sometime before year end, Huestis said. Also planned is $150 million competitive GO deal expected to arrive in the Fall or Winter, he said.</p>
