<p>British supermarket group Tesco Plc saw its shares push higher on Tuesday, as the company briefed investment analysts on its first-half performance before going into closed season, food retail analysts said.</p>
<p>The shares were 15 pence or 3.7 percent higher to 434 by 1345 GMT, close to their year's high of 439 pence set on July 11. The stock was the fourth biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index.</p>
<p>Analysts said they had not heard of any changes to profit forecasts or recommendations and the message seemed to be one of stability on margins and prices.</p>
<p>&quot;It's seen as a defensive sector and no bad news is good news,&quot; said one retail analyst, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Tesco's shares were strong last Friday, helped by a recommendation by NatWest Securities to switch from rival food superstore ASDA Group Plc into Tesco, dealers said.</p>
<p>The food retailers came under pressure early last week as investors took profits and switched into sectors benefiting from a sudden drop in the pound.</p>
<p>The sector had been boosted in recent months by its attractions as a haven from the impact of a strong pound.</p>
