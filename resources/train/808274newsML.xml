<title>HUNGARY: Hungary's o/n rates rise on reverse repo deals.</title>
<headline>Hungary's o/n rates rise on reverse repo deals.</headline>
<text>
<p>BUDAPEST, August (19) - Hungary's interbank overnight interest rates rose on Tuesday because of reduced market liquidity from funds flowing into reverse repo deals, partly on repo rate cut expectations, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The main cause (of the interest rate rise) was that everybody who could placed all the surplus money into reverse repo deals,&quot; said Sandor Tolonics of Commerzbank.</p>
<p>Overnight money traded in a narrow range between 20.125 and 20.375 percent, rising to 20.375 by the end of the session, up from Tuesday's 20.25 percent end.</p>
<p>Traders said substantial funds were placed into one-week reverse repo deals at 20 percent late last week, at the end of the two-week reserve period, when interest rates were at low levels slightly above 19 percent.</p>
<p>They added that strong repo rate cut expectations also encouraged reverse repo deals although part of the market players did not expect rate cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure that there will be a repo (rate) cut of minimum 0.25 percentage point in the near future,&quot; Tolonics said.</p>
