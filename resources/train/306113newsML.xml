<p>French food group Saint Louis on Tuesday tightened its grip on the Spanish sugar sector by acquiring a 15 percent stake in Spain's biggest sugar company and second-largest food group Ebro Agricolas.</p>
<p>Analysts welcomed the move and Saint Louis shares closed 3.17 percent higher at 1,369 francs ($255.3) on the Paris Bourse while the CAC-40 blue chip index ended 1.73 percent higher.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they want to have a controlling stake in Spanish sugar-making but I do not believe that the political powers there will allow them to do so quickly. They have to go slow,&quot; said a Paris-based food sector analyst.</p>
<p>The company's Generale Sucriere unit bought the 15 percent stake from Banco Santander. Spanish newspapers said the deal was for 17.14 billion pesetas ($129.4 million).</p>
<p>A Saint Louis spokesman declined to comment on the price but said Ebro had a market value of 110 billion pesetas, annual sales of 154 billion pesetas and a market share of 54 percent.</p>
<p>Saint Louis already has a stake of about 21 percent in Sociedad General de Azucarera de Espana (Azucarera), Spain's second-largest sugar group.</p>
<p>The two Spanish groups said in December they were working on a merger which would create the European Union's fifth largest sugar group. Ebro bought a 21.8 percent stake in Azucarera from bank Banco Central Hispano (BCH) in November.</p>
<p>Saint Louis chairman Daniel Melin has said he wants to have a stake of 20 to 25 percent in the merged group, which would produce 80 percent of Spain's European Union sugar quota.</p>
<p>&quot;We would now have a 17 percent stake in a merged group which is in line with our policy. We do not want to rise above 25 percent because we would have to make a bid for the rest. We want to be a shareholder, not an operator,&quot; Saint Louis spokesman Olivier Labesse said.</p>
<p>Spain's Ministry of Agriculture has in the past blocked attempts by the French group to increase its stake in Azucarera as part of a general policy of stopping foreign companies taking control of the Spanish sugar market.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe Saint Louis will try to get a majority and restructure the new company where there is a lot of scope for cost savings. The Spanish ministry may be against it and they can huff and puff but I do not really see how they can block it,&quot; a London-based analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a lot of political opposition to a majority stake,&quot; said Dominique Bastien of brokerage Pinatton Wargny.</p>
<p>BCH has sold another 24 percent in Ebro to a savings bank, Caja de Salamanca. The Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is Ebro's largest shareholder with a 35 percent stake, while state-owned food group Mercase is expected to increase its 4.7 percent holding by buying BCH's remaining 4.1 percent stake.</p>
<p>Dresdner Kleinwort Benson financial analyst Charles Manso welcomed the Ebro deal and said he was reviewing his Saint Louis recommendation and might raise it from &quot;hold&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the second bit of good news in two days. We have to factor that in. I think today's deal is slightly earnings enhancing,&quot; Manso said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Saint Louis said it was closing its sugar plant at Bresles in France as part of a rationalisation of its production structure.</p>
<p>&quot;The new management has been in place for 18 months now and they are doing the right things,&quot; Manso said.</p>
<p>Saint Louis is the fourth largest sugar group in Europe behind Germany's Suedzucker, Britain's Tate and Lyle Plc and France's Eridania Beghin-Say.</p>
<p>The group is controlled by Bank Worms et Cie, which has a 27.8 percent stake and Italy's IFIL SpA, an Agnelli family finance company, with a 25.9 percent stake. ($1=132.5 Peseta) ($1=5.363 French Franc)</p>
