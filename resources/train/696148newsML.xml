<p>The Indonesian rupiah was little changed against the dollar in late trading on Monday on the back of sufficient liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity was mostly sufficient despite earlier expectations that it would be tight due to month-end factors and half-year book closing.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,431.60/31.75 at 0845 GMT against an opening of 2,430.50/31.50.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah were last at 2,431.50/31.65 and 2,430.75/31.25, respectively.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the spot rupiah rate was likely to range between 2,431.00 to 2,432.50 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>One European bank dealer said trading in the spot market was seen continuing to move in a tight range, while long-term swaps were under pressure on sustained rupiah liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;Long-term swaps continued to come under pressure as some overseas operators were further squeezed due to sustained rupiah liquidity in the money market,&quot; one European bank dealer said.</p>
<p>One-month swaps fell to 12.75/14.25 from an opening of 14.00/15.00, two fell to 26.00/27.00 from 27.50/28.50, three to 39.75/41.00 and six to 81.00/83.00 from 84.00/86.00 points.  </p>
<p>Overnight swap was last at 0.20/0.25 while tom/next was at 0.13/0.15 points.</p>
<p>The central bank, Bank Indonesia, raised its intervention band by one point to 2,426/2,618 and its conversion band also by one point to 2,426/2,474 late on Monday.</p>
