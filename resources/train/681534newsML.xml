<p>New Zealand share prices ended slightly weaker on Monday as trade thinned out before the budget on Thursday and the Reserve Bank's monetary policy statement (MPS) due the following day.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index, driven mostly by minor falls in the leading issues, ended 8.74 points down at 2,414.87 on turnover worth just NZ$32.2 million.</p>
<p>Telecom was the main driver, losing six cents to NZ$7.28 as the utility aligned itself with its closing price in the U.S. on Friday.  </p>
<p>Fletcher Paper lost three to NZ$3.45 but Carter Holt Harvey, which went ex a 5.0 cents per share dividend, ended just three cents down at $3.57.</p>
<p>Phil Hardie Boys at BZW said investors may be holding back before the budget and the MPS, but he said confidence surveys would be the key.</p>
<p>Hardie Boys noted Treasurer Winston Peters' warning last week that budget surpluses would not be as high as some private analysts were forecasting.</p>
<p>&quot;But we're looking more at the confidence surveys to find anecdotal signs of how weak the economy is,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Manufacturer Ceramco exhibited signs of life, gaining six cents to NZ$1.37.</p>
<p>Likewise Sky City was up 15 at NZ$6.90 and Michael Hill International blipped up seven to $1.62, but the rises were all on light volume.</p>
<p>Brierley Investments eased one to to NZ$1.37, with weakness in Thistle Hotels' share price being the most likely cause. -- James Gray (64 9 302 1253)</p>
