<text>
<p>London coffee futures stood mixed within tight ranges on Tuesday midsession as the market shut for Christmas holidays and will not re-open until December 27.</p>
<p>Traders said quiet morning exchanges involved mainly locals trading between themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't put a finger on anything, it's so quiet,&quot; commented one.</p>
<p>The benchmark March contract $3 to $1,235 a tonne, just above its session low of $1,233, staying clear of nearby support at $1,225. The following two following positions, May and July, were firmer. Turnover reached a relatively mild 1,917 lots.</p>
<p>The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) where robusta coffee futures trade will be closed from Tuesday midsession for Christmas. It will re-open on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said Tuesday's short session was also pressured by the new U.S. certified coffee stocks data which nearly tripled in the week ending December 20 to 34,315 60-kg bags.</p>
<p>But reaction was somewhat muted with most players away.</p>
<p>Technically, robusta is seen likely to drift in the short-term to gather momentum to tackle upside barriers but the long-term outlook is bearish.</p>
<p>March is initially capped by its 10-day moving average of $1,259, but a crucial test of resistance comes in at $1,300. Downside support is pegged at $1,225 and $1,205.</p>
