<p>Athletics abandoned one of the toughest doping penalties in sport after a heated debate on Thursday because it had become a liability in court.</p>
<p>Despite fierce opposition from Britain and Canada, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) congress voted to halve its compulsory four-year ban for drugs such as body-building steroids.</p>
<p>The decision was taken because many civil courts consider the four-year suspension too harsh under restraint of trade legislation.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico's Amadeo Francis, a member of the IAAF's ruling council, said he had felt physically sick after the vote was passed with a majority of 112 votes to 56 and claimed it might encourage athletes to cheat because the penalties were softer.</p>
<p>&quot;I spoke out against it. I had to leave the room after the vote because I wanted to vomit,&quot; he said. &quot;This is going to make it cheaper to cheat. Four years was a really significant punishment. Some athletes can be injured for two years. It is a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>&quot;What concerns me is that we are being pushed by the national courts. If a national court says it should be one year then it could be one year.&quot;</p>
<p>The congress also decided to replace three-month bans for minor drugs such as stimulants with a public warning. A second offence will result in a two-year ban.</p>
<p>The four-year suspension was introduced in 1991 when the athletics world was still trying to come to terms with Ben Johnson's positive test for steroids at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the biggest scandal in the history of the sport.</p>
<p>But the tough stance has fallen apart in recent years with more and more athletes prepared to go to court, leaving sporting authorities to pay huge legal bills which can be a serious threat to their financial future.</p>
<p>Some countries such as Germany, one of several European countries who put the proposal to the congress, had already been forced to abandon the ban and suspend athletes for just two years.</p>
<p>The sport had accordingly been left in an untenable situation where cheats were being treated differently depending on their nationality.</p>
<p>&quot;In this world it is not possible to enforce that rule,&quot; said IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai. &quot;The basic rule of sport is to have equal treatment.&quot;</p>
<p>The new ruling, which comes into effect immediately, should mean that athletes who have served more than two years of a four-year ban can now return to competition.</p>
<p>After rejecting similar proposals at congresses in 1993 and 1995 because the congress felt it would send the wrong message to cheats, the IAAF had to face the reality of a sporting world which is being increasingly dominated by lawyers.</p>
