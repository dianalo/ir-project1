<p>President Boris Yeltsin expects his Chechnya envoy Alexander Lebed to explain last-minute changes made to a peace deal signed with Chechen rebels, a Kremlin spokesman said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, said to be on holiday at the hunting lodge Rus outside Moscow, did not respond personally to the overnight deal, which Lebed said marked the end of the 20-month-old conflict.</p>
<p>But his spokesman, speaking over the telephone, said:</p>
<p>&quot;The Russian president expects from the Security Council Secretary a detailed report with a clarification of the details of the agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed returned to Moscow from the North Caucasus on Saturday saying he hoped to brief Yeltsin on the deal, which put off a decision on the key issue -- whether Chechnya should be independent or remain part of Russia -- until December 31, 2001.</p>
<p>But the spokesman said Yeltsin needed time to analyse the agreement because changes had been made by both sides during the latest round of talks near the Chechen border.</p>
<p>&quot;That is it, the war is over,&quot; Lebed told dozens of people crowded into the conference room after the talks, which lasted more than eight hours, and a signing ceremony.</p>
<p>Lebed's words were shouted by a rebel fighter to crowds waiting outside, who greeted them with jubilant cries of &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; (God is the Greatest) and &quot;Lebed for president&quot;.</p>
<p>He and Maskhadov signed a three-page document which contained a joint declaration and a list of basic principles of relations between Moscow and the rebels for the next few years.</p>
<p>A joint commission will also be set up by October 1 to monitor the complete withdrawal of Russian troops and coordinate steps in fighting crime and terrorism in the region.</p>
<p>The commission is authorised to work out proposals on financial relations between Russia and Chechnya as well as a programme for the social and economic recovery of the region, devasted in the conflict in which some 30,000 people have died.</p>
<p>Fighting broke out in Chechnya in December 1994 when Yeltsin sent troops to crush independence moves. Two weeks ago he ordered Lebed, who is his national security adviser and secretary of his Security Council, to end the conflict.</p>
<p>Since then, Yeltsin has not seen his envoy.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesmen say Yeltsin, 65, is keeping in touch with events and have denied rumours he is ill. They say he merely needs to rest after a vigorous re-election campaign.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the essence of the joint statement agreed by Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov was approved in advance by a meeting of top officials ordered by Yeltsin and chaired by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;But that statement needs additional consideration in connection with the fact that the sides made some changes in the text of the document discussed at the meeting with Chernomyrdin,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lebed said Chernomyrdin was expected to chair a further meeting of government officials on Monday to review the results of his latest discussions with Maskhadov.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev praised Lebed's efforts and said the rebels were ready to play their part.</p>
<p>&quot;We are prepared to give full consideration to Russia's interests, if Russia is also prepared to consider our interests,&quot; he told Russian television.</p>
<p>But Lebed's peace plan is controversial because the withdrawal of troops leaves the rebels with the upper hand and some in Moscow fear even discussing Chechen secession could trigger separatism in other Russian regions.</p>
<p>The ceasefire has held since it began formally last Friday, but Interfax news agency said on Saturday that rebels had seized a Russian armoured personnel carrier and taken 10 soldiers hostage. It earlier quoted the military as saying Russian troops had completed their withdrawal from the Chechen capital.</p>
