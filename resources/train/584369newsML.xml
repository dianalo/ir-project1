<p>Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Don Brash said on Wednesday he rejected the bank was flip-flopping over monetary policy and he reaffirmed the bank's stance on monetary policy had been unchanged since December.  </p>
<p>Brash said the bank had received a number of critical comments after it released a statement on Monday saying monetary conditions had eased too far from the bank's desired level.</p>
<p>Conditions had eased substantially in the preceding weeks after Brash made comments in an interview which were taken by the market as a hint the bank would ease conditions in June.</p>
<p>Brash said that thereafter conditions eased by more than 100 basis points, expressed in interest rate terms, with a sharp fall in the exchange rate and no rise in interest rates.  </p>
<p>&quot;Only at that point did we indicate that conditions had moved further away from desired conditions than we felt appropriate, pending completion of our next projections,&quot; Brash said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view of desired conditions has not changed since December,&quot; he noted, in a bid to clarify the policy stance.</p>
<p>&quot;We accept that actual conditions will fluctuate and we have only acted to limit the easing when we judged that actual conditions had eased substantially and seemed to be settling too far from desired conditions.&quot;  </p>
<p>Earlier in the day the bank said it would release its forthcoming June Monetary Policy Statement on June 27.</p>
