<p>ASEAN will block any attempt by Europe to raise the East Timor issue at a ministerial meeting next week but is ready to discuss the situation in Burma, Singapore Foreign Ministry officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;On Myanmar (Burma), there will be a discussion but on East Timor there will not be a discussion,&quot; a senior official told a news briefing ahead of the 12th ASEAN-European Union (EU) Ministerial Meeting in Singapore on February 13-14.</p>
<p>&quot;The Indonesians have told us as co-chairmen that if the East Timor issue is raised by the Portuguese, they would walk out,&quot; said the official, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>He said Indonesia's position was that East Timor should be discussed under United Nations auspices and in bilateral talks with Portugal.</p>
<p>Indonesia had a very strong mandate on this issue from ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) heads of government at their informal summit on 30 November, the official said.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Portugual had not assured Singapore it would not raise the East Timor issue, the official said. But ASEAN had made clear to the EU presidency and EU members that the &quot;whole relationship would be seriouosly affected&quot; if the issue is raised.</p>
<p>Despite the difficult issues on human rights &quot;indications are good that there will be a substantive, forward-looking joint declaration after the meeting&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>The EU has been critical of Burma's human rights record and ASEAN's relations with Rangoon's military junta.</p>
<p>Indonesia has been accused of human rights violations in East Timor, which it invaded shortly after Portugal abandoned it in 1975. Indonesian rule of East Timor has never been recognised by the UN, which regards Portugal as the administering power.</p>
<p>The official said this month's meeting would seek to push forward the economic relationship between the two blocs.</p>
<p>Progress on this was thwarted at their last meeting, in Germany in 1994, because of the East Timor issue, he said.</p>
<p>The ASEAN-EU meeting will be followed on February 15 by the first Asia-Europe Foreign Ministers Meeting (ASEM). The former is bloc-to-bloc while ASEM is an inter-governmental forum of individual ASEAN members with China, South Korea, Japan and the 15-nation EU.</p>
<p>Because of this, if Burma joins ASEAN, it would not automatically become an ASEM member, another official said.</p>
<p>The political dialogue at ASEM would look at global issues and at economic cooperation, she said.</p>
<p>Singapore Foreign Ministry figures show ASEAN-EU trade rose to US$99.5 billion in 1995, up from $75.7 billion in 1994.</p>
<p>Economic matters among ASEM members will be discussed further in September at an economic ministers meeting in Tokyo and a finance ministers' conference in Thailand the same month.</p>
<p>The Singapore meeting will also launch the Asia-Europe Foundation to promote cultural exchanges. Singapore's US$1.0 million contribution to the foundation will be matched by France and Brunei, while Japan also pledged support, the official said.</p>
