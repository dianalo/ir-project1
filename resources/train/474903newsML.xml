<p>Japan's electric power firms -- major issuers of domestic straight bonds -- may drop Nomura Securities Co Ltd from their future underwriting syndicates, company officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Shikoku Electric Power Co Inc excluded Nomura from the syndicate group for its 30 billion-yen issue of 3.25 percent 20-year straight bonds, which were launched today.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been taking an extremely careful stance after the Nomura news broke,&quot; an official at the finance section of Shikoku Electric said.</p>
<p>Nomura, which acted as lead manager in Shikoku's previous issue, was passed over for the syndication group comprised of Nikko Securities, which took over as lead manager, Daiwa Securities, Yamaichi Securities, IBJ Securities, Kankaku Securities and New Japan Securities, underwriters said.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the lead manager did not include Nomura when it conducted a market survey of firms on our straight bond issue,&quot; the Shikoku Electric official said.</p>
<p>Other utility firms planned to follow suit, but company officials said they were still undecided on the timing.</p>
<p>&quot;The punitive measures against Nomura are still undisclosed so we are not sure about our longer-term plans,&quot; said a finance department official at Kansai Electric Power Co Inc.</p>
<p>Kansai Electric conducted a market survey on Thursday for possible bond issuing in future, but it has refrained from including Nomura, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;In regard to bond issues, it is important for underwriters to take full responsibility in handling bonds,&quot; he said. &quot;But if we have doubts about underwriters, then it becomes our responsibility to avoid them because it could put investors in serious trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>An official at Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc said that the company is also considering dropping Nomura.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to see what the Finance Ministry's administrative measures are before we decide our plans, but for now we're considering leaving Nomura out,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday raided Nomura's headquarters in its widening probe into payments to a client linked to &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeers.</p>
<p>Depending on the results of the search, the securities industry watchdog could recommend that the finance minister take punitive action against Nomura itself.</p>
<p>The total issue volume of corporate bonds in calendar 1996 hit a record 6.15 trillion yen, up from 5.46 trillion yen in 1995, according to the Bond Underwriters Association of Japan.</p>
<p>Electric power companies accounted for 1.52 trillion yen, or about 25 percent of that market.</p>
<p>Earlier in March, shortly after the scandal broke, Toyo Communication Equipment Co Ltd asked Nomura to stay out of the underwriting syndicate of its convertible bond issue.</p>
<p>The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) has also stopped indefinitely all trading activity with Nomura within the pension plan's internally and externally managed portfolios.</p>
<p>Major Japanese asset management firms, including Nomura's own unit, Nomura Investment Management Co, suspended business with Nomura Securities after the brokerage revealed the apparently illegal deals.</p>
