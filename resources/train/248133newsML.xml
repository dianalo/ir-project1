<p>European environment ministers completed a long environment council agenda in the early hours of Tuesday morning, boasting a common position and a political agreement for their efforts but failing to secure a deal on climate change.</p>
<p>Ministers' common position was for the European Commission's proposal for a review of the Community's Fifth Action Programme on environment and sustainable development.</p>
<p>The compromise altered references to agriculture and access to justice, according to a Commission spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;A common position was reached by the skin of the Council's teeth,&quot; the spokesman told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It was by unanimous common position. The Commission criticised a watering down of the text on integration of the environment into agriculture policies and on access to justice,&quot; he said, adding that the Council had not discussed any of the European Parliament's amendments to COM(95)647.</p>
<p>The proposal attracted parliamentarians' anger last month, when some of them described it as ineffectual and unambitious when they debated it in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Environment Euro-MPs said that with the EU likely to miss many of its 2000 targets for environmental improvement, more should be done.</p>
<p>Ministers failed to reach a deal on climate change and issued a threat to impose their long-delayed import ban on fur from animals caught in leg-hold traps against exporters in Canada, Russia and the United States.</p>
<p>Council reached political agreement on the Commission's proposal for amending Directive 90/219 on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMs), which was presented in March 1996 under article 130s(1).</p>
<p>Council also agreed its resolution on Commission proposal COM(96)399 to modify the EU's waste management strategy.</p>
<p>The main issues are the waste hierarchy -- re-use, recycle, dispose -- with the ministers' attention being on the definition of recycling as it refers to incineration with or without energy recovery versus material recycling.</p>
<p>Ministers also adopted conclusions on next year's United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS), a follow-up to the Rio conference of 1992, and heard reports from the Irish presidency on what has happened under their tenure with the Auto/Oil proposals, COM(96)248, and with the draft drinking water directive COM(94)612.</p>
<p>Ministers also discussed two other waste items concerning a spin-off proposal to Regulation 259/93 on control procedures for waste exports of non-hazardous wastes destined for non-OECD countries and final adoption of the proposed amendments to the 1993 regulation itself.</p>
<p>Ministers also heard a report on the Commission proposal for promoting non-governmental organisations working on environment issues although they will not discuss it, officials said.</p>
<p>Ministers also raced through a long list of any-other-business items, including a Commission review of efforts related to the recent accession of countries' environmental derogations, a presidency report on the third conference of the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, a report on the eighth Montreal Protocol meeting, a British report on efforts to cut ground-level ozone and to combat environment crimes, and a Swedish delegation report on Agenda 21 measures for the Baltic Sea region.</p>
