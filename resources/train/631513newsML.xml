<p>Lanica Trust Ltd, the Guernsey-based investment trust run by entrepreneur Andrew Regan, said on Monday the suspension of its shares on the London Stock Exchange would continue until CWS's private prosecution against was resolved.</p>
<p>Lanica's shares were suspended at 19.50 pounds on February 10 when its emerged that its offshoot Galileo was attempting a 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion) takeover of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), a move which collapsed in April.  </p>
<p>The takeover for the supermarkets-to-funeral parlours group collapsed after CWS succeeded in blocking the attempt through the courts and a key financial backer for Galileo, Regan's special bidding vehicle, withdrew its support.</p>
<p>&quot;We are naturally disappointed that Galileo was not able to proceed to put its proposals to the members of CWS,&quot; Regan said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We believed very strongly that these were in the best interests of Lanica Trust's shareholders, but equally importantly, to the owners of CWS. However, it was not to be&quot;.</p>
<p>Lanica said that Regan and his business associate David Lyons both &quot;confidently expect&quot; the Serious Fraud Office investigation into a previous deal between CWS and Regan's Hobson Group to exonerate the Hobson board.</p>
<p>The investigation centres on the circumstances of a controversial contract and payment of 2.4 million pounds agreed between CWS and Hobson in January 1995.</p>
<p>Lanica also reported its annual results which showed a loss for the group in the year to December 31, 1996 of 381,045 pounds, compared with a surplus of 578,456 the year before. It said that excluding the write-off of Lanica's investment in Galileo, the total surplus was 220,899 pounds.</p>
