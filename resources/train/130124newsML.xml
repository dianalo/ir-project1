<p>The rand slid to a two-month low against the dollar shortly before the close on Monday on late buying interest and dollar short-covering, dealers said.</p>
<p>After spending most of the afternoon trading in a tight 4.56-4.5625 bid range, the rand fell to 4.5650 bid level against the U.S. unit -- its worst level since August 22 when it touched 4.5680.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some late buying interest this afternoon and people were taking back their short (dollar) positions,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>In after hours trade, the rand fell further to reach 4.5670 bid on the dollar.</p>
<p>The rand initially weakened in early morning dealings on offshore and local dollar demand and covering of short positions.</p>
<p>Dealers said the central Reserve Bank's presence was felt in market around the 4.5650 level.</p>
<p>&quot;Around 4.5650 there were a lot of dollars on offer and it looked like their was some pressure from the (Reserve Bank) up north,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Londoners were also selling dollars around this level, taking some profits,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A lack of interest saw the rand spend much of the afternoon hovering around the 4.5610 bid level until the buying spurt in late dealings.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the rand to trade in 4.5525-4.5650 range on Tuesday, although the unit was seen spiking up if it broke above 4.5650.</p>
<p>&quot;If it goes above 4.5650 we are going to see it higher,&quot; a dealer said, adding that offshore players were likely to show caution about taking the rand much weaker.</p>
<p>&quot;The London guys got really burnt the last time they took the rand above 4.57, so they will be more careful this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Against the crosses the rand fell to a fresh all-time low against the pound as the British currency climbed to a one-year high against the dollar.</p>
<p>The rand touched a worst level of 7.2727 in afternoon dealings, but recovered slightly towards the close to last trade at 7.2561/2663. Against the mark, the rand was last seen at 0.3361/0.3366 from 0.3383/3389 previously.</p>
<p>On the bond market yields moved higher in quiet range-bound trading, tracking the weaker rand.</p>
<p>Dealers said players were sidelined ahead of the release of a raft of economic data due later this week including September consumer inflation and money supply figures.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been very quiet. People are a bit anxious about the figures, although a lot of it has been discounted already,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT the key R150 bond was at 15.375 percent from 15.31 percent late on Friday following some &quot;good bids&quot; at the higher levels touched during the day.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters poll of 12 economists, the September consumer price index, due on Wednesday, will rise 8.1 percent year-on-year or 0.7 percent month-on-month after rising 7.5 percent and 0.7 percent in August.</p>
<p>On the money supply front economists forecast M3, due out on Friday, would grow at a slower rate of 15.1 percent in September compared with a preliminary 15.51 percent in August. The average was drawn from a range of 14.4 percent to 15.8 percent.</p>
<p>September trade data is also expected from Wednesday. The figure drew predictions of a 720 million rand surplus compared with a 130 million rand surplus in August.</p>
<p>Bond Exchange figures show foreigners bought a net 197.40 million rand worth of South African bonds on Friday after selling 168.48 million rand the previous day.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative volumes were pegged at 3.69 billion rand from 33.83 billion rand on Thursday -- a settlement day.</p>
<p>On the money market, three-month NCDs were on Monday quoted steady at between 16.10 percent bid and 15.95 percent, while the 90-day BA rate was unchanged at between 15.55 and 15.35 percent.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank indicated the daily shortage at 7.744 billion rand on Saturday from 7.754 billion rand on Friday.</p>
