<headline>Conn. Gov. Rowland's approval slips in poll.</headline>
<dateline>HARTFORD, Conn. 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>Connecticut Gov. John Rowland's approval rating among voters has slipped to 56 - 34 percent, from 63 - 28 percent in February, according to a Quinnipiac College Poll released Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical match-up for the 1998 governor's race, Democratic U.S. Rep. Barbara Kennelly gets 44 percent to Republican Rowland's 40 percent, with 12 percent undecided -- a statistical tie, the poll found.</p>
<p>&quot;This latest poll is mixed news for Gov. Rowland,&quot; said Poll Director Douglas Schwartz.  &quot;The good news is that most Connecticut voters approve of the job he is doing and he defeats all of his potential opponents -- except one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The bad news is that his approval rating is down slightly and that one possible challenger -- Rep. Barbara Kennelly -- ties him in a head-to-head match-up.&quot;</p>
<p>The poll found that Rowland held a comfortable lead over other possible Democratic challengers, including former state Comptroller Bill Curry, New Haven Mayor John DeStefano, House Speaker Tom Ritter and Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim.</p>
<p>Curry, who lost to Rowland by only three points in 1994, now trails Rowland by 13 points, or by a margin of 35 percent to 48 percent in a hypothetical, one-on-one match-up.</p>
<p>Quinnipiac College surveyed some 782 Connecticut residents who are registered voters.  The poll was conducted July 8-13, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.</p>
