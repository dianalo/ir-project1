<p>President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday hailed a Moslem rebel chief's election as a regional governor in the southern Philippines, and committed $1.2 billion dollars in aid to develop an area battered by 24 years of war.</p>
<p>Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and who signed a peace pact with the government last week, ran unopposed in Monday's elections in a semi-autonomous region comprising four Moslem provinces in the Mindanao region.</p>
<p>Based on official partial results giving Misuari 148,060 votes in his home province of Sulu, the election commission in Manila officially declared him the victor.</p>
<p>&quot;By joining the mainstream of democratic government, the MNLF enriches our political tradition with a legacy of revolutionary ideals turned into reformist zeal and determination,&quot; Ramos said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We now foresee a leadership that is committed to fight as tenaciously for peace as it has waged war,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The peace deal, ending a 24-year separatist war that killed more than 120,000 people, has been fiercely opposed by some Mindanao Christians who accused Manila of selling out.</p>
<p>Some Christians have formed militias to fight the agreement.</p>
<p>Ramos asked Mindanao Christians to &quot;set aside all recriminations and hurts&quot; and join the government in its efforts &quot;to bring Mindanao into the brave new world of modernisation.&quot;</p>
<p>The presidential palace said a total of 32.6 billion pesos ($1.2 billion dollars) would be set aside in next year's national budget for the region's development.</p>
<p>Last week Ramos orded an additional 10 billion pesos ($385 million) released for various projects in the area for this year, officials said.</p>
<p>Misuari's election as regional governor is part of a peace deal that also calls for the establishment of an MNLF-led council to supervise development in 14 southern provinces, most of which are dominated by Christians.</p>
<p>The council will serve as forerunner of a wider autonomous region to be composed of provinces that would vote to join it in a plebiscite three years from now.</p>
<p>The country's five-million Moslem minority regard the Mindanao area as their ancestral homeland, but they are outnumbered 3-to-1 in the area by Christians.</p>
<p>Ramos' order on Tuesday for the military to disarm all vigilante groups provoked fierce reaction from one of them, the Mindanao Christian Unified Command (MCUC), which claims about 3,000 armed members.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government will insist on disarming us...we will be forced to fight them,&quot; MCUC spokesman Virgilio Andolan told reporters in Zamboanga city.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to set it straight. Our group was voluntarily formed to protect ourselves and the Christian communities from possible abuses by these (MNLF) people,&quot; he said.</p>
