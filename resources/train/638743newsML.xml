<p>Seoul stocks are expected to rise on Wednesday as foreign investors would continue picking up shares of securities firms and banks, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given Tuesday's rotational buying of securities shares and preferred stocks, the market's movement looks solid,&quot; said Park Joo-chang, a broker at Daewoo Securities.</p>
<p>The composite stock index closed 7.67 points higher at 766.06 on Tuesday. &quot;Foreigners are also likely to increase buying of blue chips, including KEPCO and Yukong Ltd, encouraged by improving economic fundamentals,&quot; said Choo Hee-yup of Dongwon Securities.  </p>
<p>Brokers said basic sentiment turned strong with rising customer deposits with brokerage houses. The funds are currently valued at 3.39 trillion won, compared with 3.04 trillion won at the end of April.</p>
<p>A shrinking trade deficit in May also raised hopes of an economic recovery.</p>
<p>The trade ministry said on Monday the deficit in May fell to $686 million from $1.44 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen figures on trade, industrial output and inflation improving steadily,&quot; Choo said.</p>
