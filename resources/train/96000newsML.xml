<headline>IPE Brent ends firmer, shrugs off profit-takers.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent closed firmer on Friday as one trader bought heavily before the close to push the contract up to a new high, brokers said. Nov Brent ended 14 cents up at $23.88 a barrel, having twice in the session retraced losses triggered by profit-taking.</p>
<p>The contract hit a low in mid-afternoon of $23.48 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some selling there today, with people taking profits, but then we saw a rebound with heating oil and another on the close.&quot; a broker said.  </p>
<p>The whole complex was earlier led up by a strong rally on NYMEX heating oil, but this ran out of steam making Brent's late jump a solo performance.</p>
<p>IPE Oct gas oil closed $1.25 down but off session lows at $245.50 a tonne, while the Nov contract climbed $1 to close just off the session high at $235.50.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been some selling on Oct, but Nov finished strong which shows the fundamentals of this market are still good,&quot; said one IPE floor broker.</p>
<p>The front-month backwardation narrowed by $2.25 to $10 a tonne, having dipped below $9 earlier.  </p>
<p>Some traders said they were selling Oct ahead of the contract's expiry on Thursday.</p>
<p>Many speculated that there will be a shortage of 0.2 percent sulphur material on the NWE physical market to cover deliveries against the screen on expiry as refiners continue to maximise the 0.05 percent grade -- also in short supply.</p>
