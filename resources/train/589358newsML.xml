<p>Juergen Klinsmann showed he was still determined to clinch Bayern Munich the German league title despite his imminent departure with a goal in a crucial 3-0 victory at Hansa Rostock on Friday.</p>
<p>Just a few hours after Sampdoria announced Germany's captain was joining the Italian club next season, Klinsmann effectively sealed three points for Bayern when he struck Bayern's second goal in the 56th minute.</p>
<p>The victory gave Bayern a four-point lead at the top over Bayer Leverkusen with two games remaining. Leverkusen, who have a game in hand, have a chance to narrow the gap when they meet struggling St. Pauli at home on Saturday.</p>
<p>German international wing back Christian Ziege, who is also leaving Bayern at the end of the season to join AC Milan, put the Bavarians ahead with a header in the 33rd minute. Midfielder Mehmet Scholl hit the third in the 62nd.</p>
<p>In the night's other match Fortuna Duesseldorf's hopes of staying in the top flight suffered a major setback when they were beaten 3-0 at home by Karlsruhe.</p>
