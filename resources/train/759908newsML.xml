<p>Dell Computer Corp., the high-flying direct marketer of personal computers, jumped into the $15 billon market for workstations Monday by introducing aggressively priced machines and promising to &quot;set the market on fire.&quot;</p>
<p>The company, which has the fastest growth rate in the personal computer industry, introduced its first workstations, the Dell WorkStation 400, at a news conference at the Nasdaq stock market to emphasise its focus on financial customers.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, Dell is introducing quite awesome workstations at price points that will set the market on fire,&quot; Linda Hargrove, vice president of workstations at Dell Americas, said at the introduction.</p>
<p>Workstations are powerful, number-crunching computers used mostly by engineers and designers for applications ranging from designing semiconductors, pharmaceuticals or automobiles to special effects for movies.</p>
<p>Dell said it is targeting the so-called &quot;personal workstation&quot; market, which includes lower-cost workstations running the Windows NT operating system instead of the costlier Unix.</p>
<p>Dell said its WorkStation 400 with a single 266-megahertz Pentium II processor from Intel Corp. will be priced at $3,705, while a machine with a 300-megahertz Pentium II dual processor will cost $8,078.</p>
<p>Company executives likened their move into workstations to their entry last year in the server market, which now produces about $1 billion in annual revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to ramp it in a simliar fashion,&quot; Kevin Rollins, president of Dell Americas, said.</p>
<p>Rollins would not give any forecasts for Dell's workstation revenues, but he said he thought Dell can do even better in workstations than in the market for servers, computers to link PCs and other computers on a network.</p>
<p>Dell said that because workstations are mostly sold directly by manufacturers to their customers and do not go through a distribution channel, they fit in with Dell's direct-marketing business model.</p>
<p>&quot;We see this as a greater opportunity for us than servers,&quot; Rollins said. &quot;Workstations are already sold direct and there is not a dominant player, such as Compaq is in the server market.&quot;</p>
<p>Compaq Computer Corp. introduced workstations in June at prices ranging from $4,200 to $11,400.</p>
<p>Analysts said Dell is not looking to displace traditional, Unix-based workstations sold by Sun Microsystems Inc., International Business Machines Corp., and Silicon Graphics Inc. Instead, they said, Dell hopes to gain market share from companies that have pioneered the Windows NT-based workstation, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Dell is letting the others kick the doors down and their approach will be, 'Now that you have made your decision to go with Windows NT (instead of the Unix operating system), let us sell you a cheaper workstation,'&quot; said Peter ffoulkes, a Dataquest Inc. analyst.</p>
<p>Dell has shaken up the personal computer industry with its direct sales to customers who can configure their own systems, with Dell's build-to-order manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p>Dell's stock, however, fell $2.625 to close at $78.875 on Nasdaq. Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff downgraded Dell's shares to attractive from a buy, citing its current valuation. Dell's shares are up 554 percent in the past 12 months.</p>
