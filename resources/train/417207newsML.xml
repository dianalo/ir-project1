<title>ZAIRE: Zaire says rebels advancing in southern Shaba.</title>
<headline>Zaire says rebels advancing in southern Shaba.</headline>

<p>Rebels pushed further into Zaire's Shaba Province on Tuesday, taking the town of Kabalo with little resistance, a Defence Ministry official said.</p>
<p>Kabalo is on the main railway line serving the copper-rich region and about 400 km (250 miles) south of the rail head at Kindu, another town taken by rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;According to our information Kabalo was taken this morning,&quot; the senior official told Reuters in the capital Kinshasa. &quot;There was nothing left there. The military who fled Kalemie looted Kabalo and left a long time ago.&quot;</p>
<p>The port of Kalemie, on Lake Tanganyika just inside Shaba, was seized by rebels early last month. Some of the government forces stationed there fled west through Kabalo, looting and at one stage hijacking a train on their way.</p>
<p>The defence official could not confirm rebel claims to have taken the town of Manono, 160 km (100 mile) south of Kabalo into the heart of the province.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no information on Manono at present,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He admitted, however, that Kindu had fallen. Rebels had sent reinforcements into the town on Monday and the remaining Zairean troops there had fled, he said.</p>
<p>Zaire had until Monday maintained Kindu, 360 km (220 miles) north of Kabalo, was in government hands.</p>
<p>Tutsi-led rebels who took up arms last October when authorities tried to expel them to their ancestral homeland in Rwanda have seized a vast stretch of eastern Zaire with seemingly little resistance by Zaire's army.</p>
<p>Guerrilla leader Laurent Kabila says he is determined to end President Mobutu Sese Seko's 31-year-old rule. He has spurned international pressure for a ceasefire, insisting on direct negotiations with Mobutu. The ailing president is in France.</p>
<p>Kabila has proclaimed Zaire's third town of Kisangani as his next target, giving government army commanders a March 13 deadline to lay down their arms.</p>
