<p>Nepal's main communist party said it would approach King Birendra on Monday to stake a claim to rule the Himalayan kingdom and end a political crisis.</p>
<p>Madav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, told Reuters in the capital Kathmandu that the communists would ally with a splinter faction of the centrist Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP).</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to the palace to stake a claim,&quot; the UML leader said.</p>
<p>Nepal said the UML and RPP faction led by Lokendra Bahadur Chand together controlled 103 votes in the kingdom's 205-seat lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>On Sunday the centrist Nepali Congress party, which headed a three-party coalition that narrowly lost a confidence vote last week, said it would attempt to form a new government.</p>
<p>King Birendra has set a deadline of Monday evening for an end to the political crisis gripping the world's only Hindu kingdom.</p>
<p>It would be the first time that parties staked competing claims to power in Nepal since multi-party democracy was restored in 1990.</p>
<p>The UML, a social democratic party with moderate economic policies, assumed power following inconclusive general elections in November 1994 at the head of a minority government.</p>
<p>But it was defeated in September 1995, when Nepali Congress cobbled together a three-party coalition with crucial support from the RPP, which was once close to the monarchy.</p>
<p>Nepal now has British-style constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p>Last Thursday the Nepali Congress-led government resigned following the razor-thin defeat of the 17-month-old coalition in a confidence vote.</p>
<p>King Birendra asked Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba Deuba to continue in power until the formation of a new council of ministers.</p>
<p>Nepali Congress said on Sunday that it had elected Girija Prasad Koirala as its new leader and its bid for power would be supported by the main RPP unit.</p>
<p>Leaders of the rival political parties were expected to go to the palace on Monday morning to present formal claims to power, leaving it up to King Birendra to determine which combination was more likely to command a majority.</p>
<p>The next general poll is not scheduled until November 1999.</p>
<p>Nepal, which maintained self-imposed isolation until the middle of this century, is one of the world's 10 poorest countries. Annual income averages $200 a head.</p>
