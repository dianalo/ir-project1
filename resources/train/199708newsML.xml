<p>Mexican rebel leader Subcommander Marcos warned on Monday that the Mexican government must decide whether it wants peace or war with his Zapatista guerrillas.</p>
<p>Amid music and dancing to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the Indian movement in this remote jungle village, Marcos said it was up to the government to get derailed peace talks with the rebels back on track.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the government must choose between death and life ... if it chooses war, we are ready. If it chooses peace, we are also ready,&quot; the charismatic rebel leader told his audience of hundreds of mostly impoverished Mayan Indians.</p>
<p>The hooded, pipe-smoking Marcos said the Zapatistas had done everything they could to bring peace to the southern state of Chiapas where they launched their rebellion in early 1994 after years of preparation.</p>
<p>The rebels and government began on-and-off peace talks shortly after the rebellion flared, killing about 150, and the guerrillas have said they want to lay down their arms and fight for Indian rights and democracy through peaceful means.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the government's turn to show it wants peace -- we have done so already. If the government wants war, then let it come after us, but it will pay a heavy price,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Zapatistas broke off talks in September after accusing the government of being inflexible and racist in negotiations. The rebels have since met with legislators that are acting as a go-between for both sides.</p>
<p>Marcos said last week that several other new guerrilla groups have sprung up in Mexico and were ready to fight the government of President Ernesto Zedillo, whose party has been in power for 67 years.</p>
