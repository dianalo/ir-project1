<p>The brigadier general in charge of Army medical operations in the Southeast has been relieved of duty, the Army said Friday.</p>
<p>The departure of Brig. Gen. Stephen Xenakis came amid media reports of a possibly improper relationship between him and a civilian nurse who cared for his critically ill wife.</p>
<p>Xenakis, 48, had been commander of Dwight Eisenhower Army Medical Centre at Ford Gordon, Ga., since December 1995 and oversaw six other Army hospitals in the Southeast and Puerto Rico as the Army's Southeast Regional Medical commander.</p>
<p>In a four-line statement, the Army said he was relieved of all duties Thursday. He had been temporarily suspended May 12 pending an investigation into what the Army termed &quot;unspecified allegations.&quot;</p>
<p>An Eisenhower Army Medical Centre spokeswoman declined to comment on a New York Times report that the Army opened an inquiry into Xenakis' relationship with the nurse in January because of an anonymous letter accusing him of misconduct.</p>
<p>The exact relationship he may have had with the nurse was not immediately clear. However, his car had been seen parked outside her home at all hours, day and night, the Times said.</p>
