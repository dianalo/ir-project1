<p>Improved refining margins over the last week were seen boosting differentials for April-loading North Sea crudes, but unsold supplies of March Brent were keeping the benchmark grade under pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>A Statfjord loading April 1-3 fetched Dated Brent +10 cents, up from the last reported trade at Dated Brent evens. The seller said other deals done on a p+c basis also indicated a slight recovery in differentials.</p>
<p>A Gullfaks C loading March 26-28 traded at Dated Brent +7 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Refining margins improved over the last week and people had the impression that the market (for Norwegian grades) was longer than it is. I think (refiners) went into their Monday morning meetings and had revised ideas about throughputs,&quot; said a Norwegian producer.</p>
<p>Margins for a complex Rotterdam refinery averaged $1.36 a barrel last week, up from the sub-$1 levels seen at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>A wet Brent loading March 27-29 at April Brent -80 cents, and a March 26-28 moved at April -81 cents. There were two April Brents passing through the paper chains on Monday, and several cargoes of March Brent were still unsold, traders said.</p>
<p>CFDs for this week recovered slightly to talk at May Brent -57/-45, with the roll into next week traded at +10 cents.</p>
<p>Outright April Brent was trading five cents down at around $19.69 a barrel on the IPE screen at 1638 GMT.</p>
