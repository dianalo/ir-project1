<p>A commission investigating the 1986 murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme is seeking access to Swiss documents relating to an arms contract with India, a Swedish newspaper reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Allegations that Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid kickbacks to Indian officials to secure a 1.3 billion dollar artillary contract hit Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government in 1987. The allegations were never proved.</p>
<p>Palme, who was shot dead by an unknown assassin in a Stockholm street in February 1986, worked very closely with Gandhi to arrange the contract. It was finalised a month after his death.</p>
<p>Ten years after the scandal, which was seen as contributing to the defeat of Gandhi's Congress Party in 1989 general elections, authorities in Switzerland are to release papers relating to the affair to India, as agreed by a Swiss court last December.</p>
<p>The Indian ambassador in Switzerland on Tuesday this week will be handed a 100 page document with details of payments into five or six Swiss bank accounts.</p>
<p>The Palme Commission also wants access to the papers after years of speculation that there could be a link between the affair and Palme's unsolved murder.</p>
<p>&quot;Last Friday we made the request to Switzerland via Interpol,&quot; head of the commission, Sten Lindstrom, told daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to know how we should draw up our request to get the bank documents as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>There is evidence that Bofors paid about 320 million crowns into various banks accounts in Switzerland during the time the contract was drawn up and settled.</p>
<p>But Bofors has denied the payments were bribes and said the money was settlement costs to its agents.</p>
<p>To date it has not been proved that any of the money was paid to Indian officials.</p>
<p>The Palme Commission has investigated several possible links between the murder of Palme and his overseas work.</p>
<p>Last year the commission sent representatives to South Africa to investigate possible involvement of the South African secret police. Palme was a leading anti-apartheid campaigner in the international arena.</p>
