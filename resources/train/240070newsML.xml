<p>Spot bulk electricity prices in the southeastern U.S. were mostly higher Friday due to the impending colder weather and unscheduled nuclear plant outages, sources said.</p>
<p>Firm, peak power in the northern part of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) territory for weekend delivery traded in the $16.00-17.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) range, while Monday prices were around $25.00.</p>
<p>These prices compare with Thursday's $21.00-22.00 trading range.</p>
<p>TVA was not offering any peak power for Monday delivery, traders said, due to the outage at its 1,148 megawatt (MW) Sequoyah 2 nuclear unit in Soddy-Daisy, Tenn.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said an electrical problem resulted in the loss of two reactor coolant pumps, causing the shutdown.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak electricity in northern TVA was assessed in the $13.50-15.00 range, mostly unchanged from Thursday.</p>
<p>At the Georgia/Florida border, prices for firm, peak electricity in 16 hour blocks for Monday delivery were quoted mostly steady around $25.00 per MWh.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak power for Monday at the Ga./Fla. border was still notionally assessed arround $16.00-17.00.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Southeast are expected to begin dropping late Saturday, with temperatures about three to 10 degrees Fahrenheit below-normal anticipated through next week.</p>
<p>Separately, Duke Power said the 1,129 MW Catawba nuclear power unit in Clover, S.C., will remain off line through the weekend due to a small leak in a reactor coolant pump.</p>
