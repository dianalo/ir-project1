<p>Hilton Hotels Corp., in a sharply worded letter to takeover target ITT Corp., Monday attacked the terms of ITT's planned sale of five hotels to FelCor Suite Hotels Inc.</p>
<p>Part of the $200 million deal calls for ITT to receive a management fee for operating the hotels, but that provision would be severed if ITT undergoes a change in control.</p>
<p>&quot;We view these change of control provisions as irresponsible and unnecessary,&quot; Hilton Chief Executive Stephen Bollenbach wrote ITT's board of directors. &quot;In this regard, Hilton is willing to purchase the five hotels at the same price.&quot;</p>
<p>Bollenbach said Hilton would acquire the five ITT Sheraton hotels, located throughout the United States, at the same price and on the same terms as FelCor, but Hilton would exclude the change of control provision.</p>
<p>&quot;If ITT is looking to dispose of any more of its core assets, Hilton is a ready, willing and able buyer,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>ITT is currently the target of a $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid by Hilton, which is based in Beverly Hills, Calif. The rival hotel and gambling company launched the offer in January. New York-based ITT rejected the bid, calling it inadequate, and began shedding non-core assets and refocusing operations on core hotels and gambling business.</p>
<p>Hilton's stock rose 50 cents to $28.75, ITT edged up 37.5 cents to $60 and Felcor slid 12.5 cents to $37.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.</p>
