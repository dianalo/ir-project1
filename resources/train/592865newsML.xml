<p>Small groups of Laurent Kabila's rebels walked through the suburbs of Zaire's capital Kinshasa on Saturday and residents flocked onto the streets to welcome them, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Senior officers and soldiers handed over weapons to the arriving rebels at Salongo Nord Camp in the suburb of Lemba, Reuters correspondent Arthur Malu-Malu reported from the camp.  </p>
<p>Kabila said earlier in Zaire's second city Lubumbashi that he was taking over as head of state with agreement of generals in Kinshasa and expected the capital to be in his hands in hours.</p>
<p>In a statement at a news conference, he said: &quot;Mr Laurent Desire Kabila assumes from today the functions of the head of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&quot;</p>
<p>The rebels have declared rebel-held areas of Zaire as the the Congo, reverting to the name used after independence in 1960 before President Mobutu Sese Seko declared the country should be known as Zaire from 1971.</p>
<p>Kabila said he had spoken to generals in Kinshasa and they had assured him all the military were willing to pledge allegiance to the newly declared government headed by the rebel chief.</p>
