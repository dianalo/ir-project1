<title>GERMANY: Bunds battered down by T-bonds, domestic troubles.</title>
<headline>Bunds battered down by T-bonds, domestic troubles.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>German Bunds remained mired at low levels in late trade on Thursday, dragged down by weaker in U.S. Treasuries and watching uncomfortably as domestic tax, central bank and budget news spilled out.</p>
<p>Analysts said talk of slightly off-the-track budget moves by the government in an attempt to make up for an 18 billion mark shortfall in tax revenes announced earlier had little direct impact on the market, but had instilled a nervous mood.</p>
<p>The DTB June future, which reached a low of 102.10 earlier in the session, was trading 30 basis points down on the day at 102.26 by 1445 GMT.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is not a large impact from what (finance minister Theo) Waigel has been up to today,&quot; said John Butler, senior fixed income analyst at West LB in Duesseldorf.</p>
<p>&quot;He is going to pull tricks out of his hat to allow Germany to reach a deficit of three percent and therefore retain Germany's position in being able to differentiate between itself and the likes of Italy.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, that talk of the possible sale of a further stake in Deutsche Telekom and of a revaluation of the Bundesbank's gold reserves was detrimental to Germany's reputation as a hardliner on Maastricht rules for EMU.  </p>
<p>On spreads, the German and U.S. markets battled for first place in the performance stakes throughout the European session, but Bunds were losing out towards the end of their day.</p>
<p>The 10-year Bund/T-note yield gap had slimmed to 109 basis points by 1518 GMT from around 111 at Wednesday's close.</p>

<p>&quot;It is highly damaging for the credibilty of the government that it is apparently seeking to revalue the Bundesbank's assets to get a handle on its problems with the deficit ratio,&quot; said Ralf Kugelstadt, economist at UBS in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Waigel said late in the trading session that he planned to revalue the Budensbank's gold reserves nearer to market levels, adding that the changes to the central bank's law would be made before the government's summer break.</p>
<p>Bunds were not impressed with the news and continued to scratch at lows. By 1513 GMT, the 10-year cash Bund benchmark was offering a 5.70 percent yield at a price of 102.23.</p>
