<p>The death toll from a cyclone that struck India's major crop-growing state of Andhra Pradesh rose to nearly 100 on Thursday as officials sifted through the wreckage, authorities said.</p>
<p>The storm, with winds of between 100 and 120 kmh (62 mph to 75 mph), hit on Wednesday evening, flattening homes, destroying crops and cutting transport and communication links. &quot;The devastation there is horrible,&quot; an official involved in relief operations said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Authorities in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh state, said 99 people had died. They expected the toll to rise after communications disrupted by the storm are restored.</p>
<p>The extent of damage to crops was also was unclear, they said.</p>
<p>The cyclone crossed the coast 50 km (30 miles) south of the port of Kakinada, wreaking havoc in the rich rice-growing districts of East and West Godavari.</p>
<p>In East Godavari district, 100,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. Power supplies were disrupted and traffic came to a standstill for several hours on the national highway after trees were uprooted.</p>
<p>Authorities said 42 people died when their boat capsized in the Godavari river during the storm.</p>
<p>&quot;These deaths could have been averted if people had heeded the advice of the authorities against venturing out during the cyclone,&quot; the senior state official M.S. Rajajee told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The system (depression) is weakening,&quot; C.V.V. Bhadram, director of the Meteorological Centre, said. He said it had moved deeper into Andhra Pradesh and was located close to the town of Khammam in the Telangana region. The storm was likely to move in a west, north-west direction.</p>
<p>The government has asked the military to help with relief operations, officials said.</p>
<p>The district administration is providing foodgrains and drinking water to all those who lost their homes.</p>
<p>Last month, floods damaged 1.13 million hectares (3.1 million acres) of land, about eight per cent of farmed areas in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
