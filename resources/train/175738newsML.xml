<p>The scale of the tragedy in eastern Zaire emerged ever more clearly on Friday with one aid worker reporting thousands dying of thirst and poisonous gases on lava fields.</p>
<p>As warnings of greater disaster came thick and fast, pressure built up to send in a foreign military relief force but the &quot;who, where and how&quot; remained nebulous.</p>
<p>Rwanda bluntly told U.N. special envoy Raymond Chretien it opposed any army contingent from France, the main advocate for military intervention to help over a million Rwandan Hutu refugees stranded in Zaire by a growing rebellion against President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>&quot;France and even Rwanda should abstain from sending troops. The force must be neutral and countries with interests must not participate in the operation,&quot; Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu told a news conference in Kigali.</p>
<p>Nearly every aid organisation of note thundered ever louder warnings as the conflict entered its fourth week on Friday.</p>
<p>Spain, France's main backer for the proposed force, said hundreds of thousands would die of hunger before help arrived.</p>
<p>The U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) warned of mass death in the next three weeks without humanitarian aid corridors.</p>
<p>&quot;People are already starving to death and we estimate that by the end of the month over 80,000 children under three will die,&quot; Catherine Bertini, WFP's executive director told Reuters.</p>
<p>Refugees and desperate Zaireans, as well as demoralised soldiers in Zaire's ragged army, are roaming all over the east.</p>
<p>Some have staggered on swollen legs into Kisangani, up to 500 km (310 miles) from the war zone, Reuters correspondent Matthew Tostevin reported from the Zairean town.</p>
<p>&quot;About 150 km (90 miles) from Goma people started to die, others were too tired to go any further and we left them by the road,&quot; said Jean-Paul Masimana, a 20-year-old student who survived the incredible trek.</p>
<p>A Spanish aid worker just out of Zaire gave a harrowing account of the suffering.</p>
<p>He said 175,000 Rwandan refugees who fled Kahindo and Katale camps in eastern Zaire after attacks by rebels headed west through wide lava fields, which emit dangerous gases.</p>
<p>&quot;They were dying in their thousands. It was an apocalypse,&quot; Fernando Rodriguez said, quoting radio reports he had heard from Zairean colleagues nearby on the mountains.</p>
<p>Food riots hit the rebel-held eastern Zaire city of Goma on Friday. Rebels fired into the air to beat back more than 1,000 hungry people fighting for the last food in a U.N. warehouse.</p>
<p>&quot;I have had nothing to eat today and nothing but water yesterday,&quot; said 60-year-old Fessu Mahkenya.</p>
<p>No food has entered Goma, which has an estimated population of about 200,000 since rebel forces seized the city late last week. Virtually all its shops and hotels have been looted.</p>
<p>An emergency health committee in Goma appealed on Friday for agencies to help, pleading for medicine and medical equipment.</p>
<p>Goma's last foreign aid workers fled to Rwanda last Saturday after fierce battles which killed more than 400 people.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole international community is called to immediate action at the highest level before it is too late,&quot; said Jean Nicholas Kasereka Busara, the health committee's head.</p>
<p>A Spanish government spokesman in Madrid said the extent of the disaster meant international action was inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;But it will be too late anyhow. Now people are starving, they are dying from hunger. When these troops reach Kindu (Zaire), it will be too late. Hundreds of thousands will be dead at that time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A complex multi-sided war in eastern Zaire has cut off more than one million Rwandan refugees from the outside world and brought misery and hunger to uprooted Zaireans.</p>
<p>The Rwandan Hutu refugees, half of them under 16, include tens of thousands of former Rwandan army troops and militiamen who fled their homeland in 1994 after committing the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>
<p>Armed Hutus, fearing death if they return to Rwanda, now guard what is left of the refugee camps in Zaire and have denied access to outsiders since an insurrection involving Tutsis and other Zaireans cut them off from foreign aid.</p>
<p>On Thursday Zairean villagers near the huge Mugunga camp west of Goma said Rwandan Hutu fighters seized about 100 local children to use as human shields in case of a rebel advance.</p>
