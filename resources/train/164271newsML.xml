<headline>Judge denies intervention in Milken global pact.</headline>

<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>A federal judge Monday denied efforts by TLC Beatrice International Holdings to intervene in the landmark 1992 global settlement of claims against Michael Milken and others associated with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</p>
<p>The ruling by U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack marks the second time he has dismissed TLC Beatrice's attack on a class action that was formed to resolve litigation against Milken, who pioneered the use of junk bonds while at Drexel, the once-powerful investment banking firm.</p>
<p>Although Pollack issued his first ruling in September 1995, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals revived the challenge in August 1996 and sent the matter back for rehearing.</p>
<p>TLC Beatrice had challenged the class action, known as Presidential Life Insurance v. Milken, on grounds that its claims had not been given due process and that it had not received legal notice of the class action suit.</p>
<p>In the Prudential Life class action, plaintiffs alleged that the Milken defendants conspired to violate federal securities and antitrust laws and had manipulated prices of securities in the market for high-yield bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;The court finds that TLC's intervention motion is grossly untimely,&quot; Pollack wrote. &quot;The potential prejudice that may flow to the settling defendants and other class members if TLC is afforded relief from the judgment, three years after its entry, makes intervention impermissible.&quot;</p>
<p>Pollack said that TLC, despite its knowledge of the global settlement, did not opt out of the class action and did not object at a fairness hearing. It did not ask to intervene in the settlement until 1995.</p>
<p>He said that over 42,000 notices to identifiable class members had been sent and notice of the suit had been published in more than 200 publications. Nearly 200 class members opted out by the June 24, 1992, deadline.</p>
<p>The judge had approved the $1.3 billion settlement in March 1992 after getting the support of all major parties including the Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>
<p>The judge announced the same day that he would approve a bankruptcy court's approval of Drexel's $2.4 billion reorganization plan.</p>
<p>The litigation against Milken and Drexel related to their 1990 guilty pleas to criminal securities fraud charges. Drexel filed for bankruptcy that year and eventually went out of business.</p>
<p>Milken served two years in prison and paid more than $1 billion in fines and restitution. He recently agreed to an extention of his probation while the Securities and Exchange Commission investigates whether he violated terms of the settlement by acting as a consultant in several high-profile transactions.</p>
