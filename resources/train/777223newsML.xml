<p>American Marion Jones ushered in a new era in women's sprinting on Sunday when she won the first global 100 metres title of her career by the width of her vest.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old former college basketball player came off best in a dramatic photo finish with Ukraine's Zhanna Pintussevich, who was so confident that she had won the race that she immediately set off on a victory lap.</p>
<p>For a minute Jones was left standing at the end of the home straight wondering if she had misjudged the finish.</p>
<p>But when the Ukrainian was halfway down the back straight, surrounded by a group of photographers, the giant scoreboard showed that Jones had won in 10.83 seconds with Pintussevich second two-hundreths of a second behind. Sevatheda Fynes of the Bahamas took the bronze medal in 11.03.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I had got her but then she started celebrating,&quot; Jones said. &quot;Then I looked over and some of my American team mates gave me the thumbs up. It is a great feeling. Now for the fun part, jumping a personal record in the long jump and getting a world record in the relay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am overwhelmed with what has happened to me in the last couple of months. I definitely hope that a new era has begun. I am very excited. This tops the list of things I have done in my career.&quot;</p>
<p>After finishing fifth over 100 in the U.S. trials for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics as a 16-year-old, Jones has not made an impact in athletics until this season after concentrating on a successful basketball career and suffering several foot injuries.</p>
<p>She was largely unknown outside the United States until she won the national title this season and does not even appear in some track and field handbooks.</p>
<p>After turning her back on basketball and setting her mind totally on athletics, Jones seems to have the potential to hold the crown as the world's fastest woman for some time, making millions in the process from sponsorship deals and victories on the grand prix circuit.</p>
<p>The world of athletics will have to get used to her own particular brand of sprinting. Jones keeps her head down in the first part of the race as though she is running into heavy wind and rain. In the second 50 metres, her eyes are focused on the line as she moves into top gear.</p>
<p>&quot;I always knew it would happen,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The era of Jamaican veteran Merlene Ottey, who finished seventh, and defending champion Gwen Torrence, who withdrew before the championships began, now appears to be over.</p>
<p>Ottey, 37, has won a record 13 world medals but has never won a 100 gold and her concentration was badly disrupted on Sunday when she did not hear the gun for a false start and ran more than 50 metres down the track alone.</p>
