<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Severin said on Thursday he hoped Pope John Paul would visit his country and help bring an end to a dispute between the Orthodox Church and minority Byzantine Rite Catholics.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pope has expressed for a long time the desire to visit Romania and I hope that this can happen as soon as possible,&quot; Severin told reporters.</p>
<p>Severin, who delivered an invitation to John Paul on Thursday to make a first visit by a Pope to Romania, added he hoped a such trip would &quot;help religious reconciliation in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Leaders of Romania's Orthodox Church are against a visit by the 76-year-old Pontiff taking place before progress is made in settling a longstanding dispute with the Byzantine Rite Catholics.</p>
<p>Liviu Stoina, adviser to the Orthodox Patriarch's office, said in Bucharest on Wednesday: &quot;We don't oppose a visit by His Holiness the Pope. But for the visit to take place, we need peace and reconciliation with (the Byzantine Rite) church.&quot;</p>
<p>Only about 1.2 million Romanians, or some five percent of the population, are Latin-rite Roman Catholics. A further 223,000, mainly in the central Transylvania region, are Byzantine Rite Catholics who worship in an eastern orthodox liturgy but are in unity with Rome.</p>
<p>Byzantine Rite Catholics were banned under Romania's communist regime and their churches were confiscated.</p>
<p>The Byzantine Rite Catholic Church was re-legalised in 1989 after the fall of communism but the government has yet to tackle the thorny issue of returning 2,500 churches and other assets.</p>
