<p>Indian shares faltered in after-hours kerb trading on Friday after the United Front government said there had been no change in leadership ahead of a key parliamentary confidence vote.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point, the trend in the stock market is anyone's guess. People are taking speculative positions based on their perception of the unfolding situation,&quot; said the head of a local broking firm.</p>
<p>Largest private firm Reliance Industries dropped 2.7 percent to 262.50 rupees from its official close of 269.50.</p>
<p>State Bank of India slid to 271.50 rupees from 277.50 and tobacco giant ITC dropped to 391.50 rupees from its official 395.75 close.</p>
<p>Stock prices rebounded sharply in late trade after leaders of the ruling United Front coalition and the Congress party, an ally-turned-foe, said they were holding talks amid rising hopes of finding a successor to Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda. Under such as scenario, fresh elections could likely be avoided.</p>
<p>&quot;The knee-jerk reaction was swift and upwards,&quot; said Ketan Jhaveri, chief dealer at Kotak Securities, the Indian partner of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Bombay's benchmark stock index closed 35.36 points, or 0.98 percent, higher at 3633.73 -- more than three percent up from its early low of 3512.05.</p>
<p>But hopes that fresh talks would yield a new prime minister were shattered after the market's official close.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no change in leadership,&quot; Sitaram Yechury, a member of the United Front's decision-making Steering Committee, told reporters after leaders met to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>Traders said hopes that the market-friendly federal budget for 1997/98 (April-March) would be passed despite the political turmoil capped the fall in stock prices in kerb deals.</p>
<p>Political leaders have agreed to hold a special session of parliament later this month to try to salvage the budget, which has been held hostage by the political crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The key issue for the market is whether the budget will be passed. It's almost become an independent issue,&quot; said Rupa Bose, strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in Singapore.</p>
<p>The Congress party's withdrawal of vital support for Deve Gowda's coalition on March 30 raised fears that the budget proposed a month earlier, and still unapproved by parliament, would be a casualty if the government were ousted.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda on Friday moved the vote of confidence in his government before the lower house of parliament. Eight hours of debate is expected before the vote is taken.</p>
<p>&quot;We are asking investors to wait and watch for things to take shape,&quot; said Sanjeev Mohta, head of research at securities firm James Capel B&amp;K. &quot;The main issue remains the budget.&quot;</p>
<p>Congress has ordered its 140 deputies to vote against the motion. Opposition rightwing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies, with 193 votes, have also decided to vote against Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>But the BJP sought to allay fears in the business community by promising to help pass the budget after the vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a responsible party,&quot; said BJP spokeswoman Sushma Swaraj. &quot;We can't trifle with the economic agenda of the nation.&quot;</p>
<p>Bose at Paribas Capital said stock markets were likely to remain volatile.</p>
<p>Major exchanges in the country will open on Saturday to give investors a chance to react to the unfolding crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets will see a bit of a roller-coaster ride but if the index goes below 3,000-3,200 points, I would call a buy. I see no reason to panic,&quot; she said.</p>
