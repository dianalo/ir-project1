<p>France on Monday played down German fears that politicians might undermine the independence of a future central bank (ECB) under its proposals for an economic council for countries in European monetary union.</p>
<p>French officials said a French call for such a council to co-ordinate economic policies among EMU members in no way threaten the independence of the ECB.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said France wanted an informal stability council, respecting the principles of subsidiarity (devolving decisions to national level where possible), and fully respecting the independence of the central bank,&quot; a finance ministry official said. &quot;There has never been a debate on this question and there will not be,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>French calls for the economic council, which appear to be gaining support among its European Union partners, have raised fears this could be used to try to influence the future central bank, which will fix monetary policies.</p>
<p>Former Bundesbank head Karl-Otto Poehl warned on Saturday that any political pressure on the ECB would run counter to the Maastricht treaty, which guarantees its independence, and may have a &quot;catastrophic&quot; impact on financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;If financial markets became convinced that a European central bank could be forced by political pressure to conduct a deliberate policy of devaluing the euro against the dollar or the yen, there could be portfolio shifts of catastrophic proportions,&quot; he said in a written commentary published in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Friday, Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said that any attempt to create a political power to influence monetary policy would be against the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis pledged last week to use the months ahead to promote France's idea of a economic council, which he described as &quot;an absolute necessity.&quot;</p>
<p>It would have a similar structure to the informal Group of Seven (G7) rich nations forum -- another grouping first set up by France -- which has no secretariat nor headquarters.</p>
<p>It would discuss fiscal policies and implement a budget stability pact agreed last December obliging governments to limit budget deficits after the launch of the euro in 1999.</p>
<p>It would also discuss exchange rates, agreeing for example a common position on the euro for bigger countries representing Europe at the G7, or co-ordinating links between the euro and currencies of European countries outside the single currency.</p>
<p>Under the Maastricht treaty, exchange rate policy will remain in the hands of governments after the launch of the euro while the independent central bank will fix monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea is to put something in place which will make the whole system work,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>At the nub of the war of words on the ECB are fears France might try to push for a weaker euro than that sought by Germany when the single currency is launched.</p>
<p>French officials have said repeatedly in the past that the dollar had room to appreciate against European currencies.</p>
<p>France may however have already won half that battle after the recent sharp rise in the dollar against the mark -- which has also pushed it up against the franc. The franc-mark exchange rate has remained stable during the dollar's rise.</p>
<p>On Monday the dollar briefly touched 5.50 francs, the level cited by former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing last November when he called for a sharp devaluation in the franc to boost growth and jobs.</p>
