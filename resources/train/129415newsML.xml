<p>A freer monetary policy that promises to rein in high interest rates and reverse an economic slowdown will boost Indian stock markets this week, brokers and analysts said at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will open with a big jump,&quot; said Mehul Patel, dealer at Mukesh Babu Securities Ltd, a broking firm at the Bombay and National bourses. &quot;We see a gain of 150-180 points this week.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange last week ended 30.31 points, or 0.96 percent, lower at 3,130.21 compared with the previous week.</p>
<p>The central bank announced on Saturday a two percentage points cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banks to 10 percent, effective in four stages over the next four months.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also cut the ceiling on interest for banks' deposits for maturities of 30 days to one year to 10 percent from 11 percent.</p>
<p>The announcements came as part of the monetary policy for the second half of the 1996/97 (April-March) financial year.</p>
<p>&quot;Both these announcements will reduce the cost of funds and should theoretically result in a proportionate increase in profits (of the banking sector),&quot; ICICI Securities and Finance Company (I-Sec) said in a report.</p>
<p>The two measures sparked an immediate cut in the lending rate by the state-run Bank of Baroda, which reduced its prime rate to 15 percent from 15.5 percent effective from Monday.</p>
<p>Another state-controlled bank, Corporation Bank, said it planned to cuts its prime rate to 14.5 percent from 15.5 percent. Other banks are expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>&quot;The ... policy is expected to release funds into the economy and will provide impetus to the industrial sector with immediate benefit to industries like consumer durables, automobiles, paints, sugar and power equipment,&quot; said Credit Rating and Information Services of India.</p>
<p>&quot;Other industries like cement, steel and petrochemicals will also see some relief, though with a lag,&quot; it said in a report.</p>
<p>The RBI also allowed banks to buy shares and bonds from the secondary market, subject to a five percent ceiling of the additional deposits that the banks mobilise this year over the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate the total funds with the banks for this purpose at about 30 billion to 35 billion rupees ($841.51 million to 981.77 million), but see only a small portion remaining for investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the higher comfort level of bank treasuries with fixed-income investments rather than in equities...(only 10 billion rupees) can be reasonably expected to flow to the secondary equity market,&quot; I-Sec said.</p>
<p>The new policy would boost sagging morale but the market would take time to consolidate gains, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think our troubles are over,&quot; said Maulik Sharedalal, a BSE member-broker. &quot;The new policy is positive but it'll take time to impact public perception of corporate performance.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it was difficult to sustain a rally until scared retail investors shed their lethargy and returned to the market. ($1 = 35.6 rupees)</p>
