<p>All 46 passengers and crew aboard a southern Russian regional airline died when the AN-24 plane crashed on Tuesday en route to Turkey, officials said.</p>
<p>It was the worst domestic disaster for Russia's troubled airline industry in more than a year.</p>
<p>The charter Stavropol Airlines flight crashed 37 minutes after take off from Stavropol to Trabzon on Turkey's northern coast, said Mustafa Seyis of the Slotur agency which represents the plane's Russian owners in Turkey.</p>
<p>Emergency officials in Stavropol said the plane was carrying 41 passengers and five crew.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the plane burned mid air and fell down into a forest...Nobody heard the blast,&quot; said Vladimir Konnonov, the duty officer of the local emergency committee. &quot;Rescue teams say nobody survived in the crash.&quot;</p>
<p>The plane went down during a snowstorm without issuing a distress call to air traffic controllers, Konnonov said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our controllers have lost communication with the plane's crew at about 10:50 a.m. (0750 GMT) and the aircraft disappeared from the radars at the same time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted local police official Boris Erkenov as saying the plane blew up, spreading human remains and aircraft debris across a three km (two mile) area. Earlier reports put the number of victims at 48.</p>
<p>Officials say most if not all passengers were Russian &quot;shuttle traders&quot; who go abroad to buy goods to resell at home.</p>
<p>The plane crashed in a forest near the North Caucasus town of Cherkessk, capital of the ethnic region of Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, officials said.</p>
<p>Russia's air safety standards have plunged since the Soviet monopoly airline Aeroflot was split into hundreds of smaller domestic companies after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>Many of them are struggling financially, forcing them to take short cuts in maintenence and safety standards, experts say.</p>
<p>The government-owned Rossiiskaya Gazeta daily newspaper said earlier this week that 219 people had been killed last year in 43 air accidents in Russian air space, 14 of them major.</p>
<p>Of all air crashes in the former Soviet Union last year, 80 percent were caused by human error, the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee said last month. Most air accidents occur on take off or landing, not mid route as in this case.</p>
<p>The ageing AN-24 is a 52-seat propeller plane used for short and medium distance flights.</p>
<p>Stavropol Airlines, which was not available for comment, flies both domestic and international passenger and cargo flights, a Federal Aviation Service official in Moscow said.</p>
<p>The crash was the largest in Russia since December 1995, when 97 died in an air disaster in the Russian Far East. A Vnukovo Airlines flight crashed in Norway last August, killing 140.</p>
