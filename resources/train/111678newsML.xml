<p>East Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and exiled resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for their efforts to solve a 21-year-old conflict with Indonesia.</p>
<p>They won the $1.12-million prize &quot;for their work toward a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor&quot;, Committee Chairman Francis Sejersted said.</p>
<p>Praise from around the world for the choice of Belo and Ramos-Horta mixed with consternation in Jakarta. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, just after Portugal pulled out, and annexed the territory a year later. The annexation has never been recognised by the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't understand what were the criteria by which they chose them,&quot; Indonesian state secretary Murdiono said, adding that he was speaking in a private capacity.</p>
<p>The Nobel Committee, which openly accused Indonesia of oppressing East Timor's population, said in a statement it wanted to honour Belo and Ramos-Horta for &quot;their sustained and self-sacrificing contributions for a small but oppressed people&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nobel Committee hopes that this award will spur efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in East Timor based on the people's right to self-determination.&quot;</p>
<p>Sejersted told reporters: &quot;We want to put the spotlight on this conflict. I hope this situation will strengthen their negotiating basis and also protect them personally.&quot;</p>
<p>Indonesia is participating in tripartite talks with Portugal and the United Nations to seek a solution to the issue. They met in Geneva in June and the next round is due in December after the U.N. General Assembly session.</p>
<p>&quot;Belo...has been the foremost representative of the people of East Timor. At the risk of his own life, he has tried to protect his people from infringements by those in power,&quot; the committee said.</p>
<p>Belo, 51, East Timor's outspoken and often fiery bishop, was saying Mass at a school in the territory's capital Dili when the award was announced.</p>
<p>Reached later, he said of the award: &quot;I see it as a victory for East Timorese...and all Indonesians.&quot;</p>
<p>Belo said there was hard work ahead in the peace and reconciliation process. &quot;Peace can be achieved through non-violent means,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta, 48, a leader of East Timor resistance to Indonesian rule, now based in Sydney, Australia, said he was happy but also sad at the award because his jailed leader Xanana Gusmao should have won.</p>
<p>&quot;I receive the news with pleasure and with sadness,&quot; Ramos-Horta said in a Lisbon radio interview from Sydney.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta said that he had pressed &quot;my friends in Scandinavia that...they should also propose Xanana&quot;.</p>
<p>Gusmao has been in prison in Jakarta since 1992 when he was captured by Indonesian security forces and sentenced to 20 years in jail.</p>
<p>The Vatican hailed the award of the prize to Bishop Belo, saying it hoped the honour would promote a peaceful solution in East Timor in respect for the rights of the people.</p>
<p>Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio said: &quot;The award reflects their indefatigable work in the service of human rights and peace in the territory. I am very pleased by the news. It is a wonderful surprise.&quot;</p>
<p>East Timor remains a thorn in Jakarta's international relations with little relief in sight.</p>
<p>Diplomats, political analysts and local residents say two decades of Indonesian rule -- mainly through the armed forces -- has failed to win many hearts and minds among the 800,000 East Timorese despite major development efforts by Jakarta.</p>
<p>Friday's announcement of the peace prize, the only one of the Nobels to be made in Oslo, concluded this year's batch of awards. The Nobel science, medicine, economics and literature awards were announced in Stockholm over the past eight days.</p>
<p>All the 1996 awards are to be presented on December 10.</p>
