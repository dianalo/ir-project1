<title>SLOVAKIA: Slovak government replaces deputy finance minister.</title>

<p>The Slovak government said on Tuesday it had replaced Deputy Finance Minister Jozef Magula, a sharp critic of recent changes to the securities law, with an economic advisor of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.</p>
<p>A government statement said Magula will be replaced by Peter Stanek. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>&quot;I offered my resignation at the end of last year, mainly due to my opposition to some of the latest changes on the capital market,&quot; Magula told Reuters.</p>
<p>Magula criticised the amendment to the securities law, approved by parliament in December, saying it harmed transparency on the country's capital market.</p>
<p>The new law forces trading of registered shares onto accredited bourses.</p>
<p>But the law, which had been sent back to parliament by President Michal Kovac for revision, omitted a controversial clause which would have allowed major shareholders to arbitrarily cancel trade in an issue.</p>
<p>In addition to barring trading outside officially registered markets, the new law also forbids changes of registered shares into bearer shares, which was permitted under the previous law.</p>
