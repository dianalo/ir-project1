<p>Human rights groups on Tuesday condemned a proposed law barring most Palestinians from seeking damages from Israel for injuries suffered during their national uprising.</p>
<p>The bill would classify the six-year intifada as a war. Under existing law, Israel is not liable for damages resulting from &quot;war activity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;(This law) gives (soldiers) the license to shoot, to maim, to hit knowing full well that the state will absolve them,&quot; said human rights activist Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israelis killed 1,206 Palestinians during the intifada, which subsided in 1993 with the signing of a landmark Israel-PLO interim peace deal. Palestinians killed 179 Israelis during the same period.</p>
<p>Palestinians have filed about 4,000 claims for damages totalling tens of millions of dollars since the start of the intifada in 1987, according to Israel's justice ministry.</p>
<p>Human rights lawyer Eliahu Abrams said 600 suits are now pending in Israeli courts. Few Palestinians have received compensation for their injuries.</p>
<p>Israeli Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi defended the law, saying it had support across the Israeli political spectrum and called many of the damage claims &quot;fictitious&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This law is not meant to deny reparations. It comes to prevent reparations to those who do not deserve them,&quot; he told Israel's army radio.</p>
<p>Under the proposed law, Palestinians could still receive compensation if they prove that soldiers &quot;intentionally inflicted injury&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This law is meant in essence to arrange the appropriate way to deal with claims and how it will be possible to recognise just claims. I assume that a large portion of claims that were presented will be judged in the courts,&quot; Hanegbi said.</p>
<p>The amount of compensation would be based on the local economy.</p>
<p>That's not enough, said Hedva Radovanitz of Physicians for Human Rights in Israel, when the average cost for a day in an Israeli hospital is around $1,000.</p>
<p>Palestinian Munir Muhammed Mahmud Karaja has already incurred about $15,000 in medical costs since he was shot in the forehead with a rubber bullet last month in the Hebron market.</p>
<p>&quot;I lost part of my memory, my hands shake all the time, my eyes hurt. I cannot write anymore. I was a writer, and I cannot do it anymore,&quot; said Karaja, 70, adding he walked inadvertantly into an area where youths were clashing with soldiers.</p>
<p>Eitan Felner, Executive Director of the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, said the bill was a &quot;legal recipe for impunity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We call on you to ask each and every member of Knesset whether they think Mr. Karaja is a combatant -- a person over 70 years old who went to the market to buy vegetables ,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Justice Ministry has said the government could still unilaterally grant compensation on humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p>In a related development, a human rights organisation warned of violence if the Jerusalem municipality demolishes 150 illegally-built Arab homes in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman denied the municipality had such a plan, which the IrShalem-Jerusalem group said would be implemented in October.</p>
