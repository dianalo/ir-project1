<p>President Bill Clinton reached out to key companies on Monday to hear their views in the contentious debate over how to cut pollution from the burning of oil, coal and gas to stem global warming.</p>
<p>The White House invited the chief executives from utilities, and oil, gas, steel, chemical, manufacturing and financial services companies, to discuss their views on what the U.S. position should be in international talks for a climate treaty due to be signed in Kyoto, Japan in December.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very good, serious meeting,&quot; White House spokesman Michael McCurry said.</p>
<p>The 10 business leaders, who were all unreachable for comment afterward, focused on credit trading as a way to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and policies to help developing countries curb their pollution, McCurry said.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration has proposed setting emissions budgets and letting companies that pollute less than the maximum allowed sell credits to companies that emit too much.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe there should be realistic but binding limits to emissions of greenhouse gases,&quot; Clinton said at the beginning of the meeting, adding that there was &quot;pretty clear evidence that the climate is changing.&quot;</p>
<p>Some of the companies questioned how much of an impact industrial activity was having on the world's climate, McCurry said. But the group present did not include many of the hardline companies that oppose any treaty which would set strict limits on emissions of heat-trapping gases.</p>
<p>Clinton repeated the administration's mantra that it wanted emissions to be cut without a heavy toll on the economy, although industry groups say any move to reduce the use of oil, coal and gas would be devastating.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that we have to do it in a way that keeps our economy growing,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Under pressure from industry groups, the Senate 10 days ago passed a resolution urging the administration to reject any treaty that does not commit developing countries to cutting their emissions, even though the industrialised countries have caused most of world's pollution.</p>
<p>Companies fear that they will be at a disadvantage if only industrialised countries have to control their pollution.</p>
<p>&quot;I think all nations, developed and developing, should be a part of this,&quot; Clinton said. But under the terms for the Kyoto negotiations, industrialised countries agreed that the treaty should only set binding targets on the rich nations.</p>
<p>Companies represented at the meeting were Aluminum Co of America, American Electric Power Co, Bethlehem Steel Corp, British Petroleum Co, Enron Corp, FMC Corp, Georgia-Pacific Corp, Honeywell Inc, PacifiCorp, and Salomon Inc.</p>
