<headline>Studies shed light on childhood allergy.</headline>

<p>Two studies published on Thursday shed more light on what causes children to develop allergies such as asthma or hay fever, suggesting the causes lay in early childhood or even in the womb.</p>
<p>An Italian study found children exposed to hepatitis A were less likely to develop allergies, while a Danish researcher found that children with atopic dermatitis, a chronic allergic skin condition, may be born with a predisposition to it.</p>
<p>Dr Paolo Matricardi of the Laboratorio di Immunologia et Allergologia in Rome studied more than 1,600 students at an air force school and found that those who had antibodies to the hepatitis A virus -- indicating they had been exposed -- were less likely to have allergies.</p>
<p>Writing in the British Medical Journal, researchers said they were investigating earlier studies that showed children with older siblings were less likely to develop allergies, perhaps because they were exposed to disease carried home by older brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Matricardi's group said children who had three or more older siblings were also less likely to get allergies, and concluded that common infections early in life helped protect against allergies.</p>
<p>Other studies have indicated that infection in infancy somehow &quot;sets&quot; the body's immune system so it reacts properly to invaders. Allergy is seen as an over-reaction of the immune system.</p>
<p>Dr Anne Braae Olesen and colleagues at Aarhus University Hospital and colleagues checked the birth records of more than 7,600 babies for factors such as their birth weight and the age of their mother.</p>
<p>They then looked for instances of atopic dermatitis. Nearly 19 percent of children developed the condition, but Olesen's group found that those born late, and who weighed more than average, were the most likely to get it.</p>
<p>They said this could indicate that a predisposition to develop the condition is determined before birth.</p>
<p>Pollution has often been blamed for causing allergies but several recent studies suggest that, while it can aggravate asthma and other conditions, pollution is unlikely to be the underlying cause.</p>
