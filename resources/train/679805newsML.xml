<p>The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) lowered its 1997 economic growth forecast on Monday, but said the economy was getting back on track after a sharp first quarter slowdown.</p>
<p>The CSU said real gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to rise two to three percent this year after 4.1 percent in 1996, down from its May forecast of 2.9-3.5 percent growth.</p>
<p>Czech GDP growth slowed to 1.5 percent in the first quarter from 4.6 growth in the same period last year according to data released last week which surprised some analysts who expected even a contraction for the period.</p>
<p>The CSU changed methodology for calculating GDP in 1997 but said first quarter data would be similar under the 1996 method.</p>
<p>The statistical bureau said on Monday that improving export and industrial production in April and May showed that many short-term factors which were limiting growth in the first quarter were disappearing.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no decline or stagnation in the Czech economy,&quot; the CSU prognosis report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Industrial, construction, export and other data... show that the slowdown of growth at the turn of 1996 and 1997 was mainly caused by temporary influences... (so) the economy has the tendency to return to a normal growth track,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The prognosis was drafted after the Czech currency fell in May to more than 15 percent below its February peak.</p>
<p>Speculative attacks on the crown forced the central bank to raise its lombard rate to 50 percent from 14 percent and to float the currency, and longer-term rates moved higher.</p>
<p>Following the crown drop, the government adopted its second austerity programme in as many months including combined budget cuts of 42 billion crowns ($1.3 billion), and predicted an economic decline.</p>
<p>The statistical bureau said the restrictions would be partially outweighted by larger growth in domestic production created by the crown's fall.</p>
<p>CSU vice-chairman Ivan Sujan told reporters that short-term influences, including a slowdown in Europe, bad winter, and an overvalued currency were fading, creating room for growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the slowdown of the GDP was from two thirds caused by the short-term influences,&quot; Sujan said, adding one-third came from a lack of restructuring in industry.</p>
<p>The CSU also lowered forecasts of the full-year foreign trade deficit to 160-180 billion crowns from a previous 190-200 billion and a gap of 159.8 billion last year.</p>
<p>It said the current account deficit should reach 6.7 to 7.3 percent of GDP, down from the earlier forecast of 8.2 to 8.6 percent, while the inflation forecast was changed to 8.5 to 9.5 percent from 8.2 to 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>Some economists said that despite some good signs the CSU was too optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Two to three percent (growth) is overly-optimistic, especially because of the high interest rates,&quot; said Jiri Krovak of WoodCommerz, adding that budget tightening was another factor for his lower estimate.</p>
<p>Krovak's firm last week forecast the current account deficit to grow to more than 11 percent of gross domestic product for 1997, with the economy growing a real two percent.</p>
<p>&quot;In this country GDP has always been driven by domestic demand and if you lose domestic demand you lose the main driving force of GDP growth,&quot; Krovak said.</p>
<p>Vladimir Kreidl of Investment bank Patria Finance agreed that the forecast was too pink. &quot;We see the growth rather close to zero this year,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the prognosis underestimates the influence of budget cuts and high interest rates, and... it overestimates the positive impact of the devaluation of the crown,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>London-based research firm HILFE said on Monday that it predicted Czech growth at 0.6 to 1.3 percent this year.</p>
