<title>POLAND: Polish zloty in bull run to parity - dealers.</title>
<headline>Polish zloty in bull run to parity - dealers.</headline>
<dateline>WARSAW 1997-07-25</dateline>

<p>The Polish zloty firmed half a percentage point against the basket in early Friday trade and dealers said the local currency's bull run may push the unit back up toward parity within days, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said Thursday's central bank currency-selling intervention, which occured when the zloty slipped just below -1.5 percent from parity, created a strong bullish zloty sentiment on the market and sent the local unit soaring.</p>
<p>&quot;Polish banks are selling-currencies and so are foreigners and the zloty could rise to zero (parity) within days,&quot; said Pawel Gajewski, forex dealer at Creditanstalt in Warsaw.  </p>
<p>At 0755 GMT the zloty was -0.47/-0.66 percent from the parity rate, against opening's -1.21/-1.48 percent from parity and Thursday's close at -1.49/-1.55 percent.</p>
<p>It was at 3.4260/20 to the dollar, against 3.4510/00 at opening and at 1.8660/00 to the mark against 1.8800/50.</p>
<p>The OECD joined other international organisations in urging Poland to drastically tighten its fiscal policy to contain the fast growing current account deficit.</p>
<p>It said Poland should cut the budget gap to 1.5 perent of GDP in 1998 and balance the budget in 1999, while the finance ministry says a 1.9 percent gap in 1998 would be sufficient.  </p>
<p>Some dealers said however that the zloty could be subject to some profit taking after rising some five percentage points from last week's all-time lows.</p>
<p>On the money market one-day rates eased as banks wanted to place cash on the market for the weekend, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overnight rates fell to 18.50/21.00 percent from opening's 21.00/21.20 percent and Thursday's 21.70/22.45. Tomorrow/next were at 21.00/22.50 percent, against Thursday's 22.00/22.35.</p>
