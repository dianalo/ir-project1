<title>AUSTRALIA: BHP shuts second grinding mill at Ok Tedi.</title>
<headline>BHP shuts second grinding mill at Ok Tedi.</headline>

<p>The Ok Tedi copper mine in the western province of Papua New Guinea has shut its second semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill after reviewing its supplies of diesel fuel, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) said on Monday.</p>
<p>The mine's other SAG mill was shut last week as a result of a dry weather spell throughout the country's highlands regionl which has affected shipping on the Fly River.</p>
<p>The mine depends on Fly River shipping for the transport of its copper concentrate.</p>
<p>&quot;Mining operations are continuing, but on a reduced level, concentrating on waste and overburden removal,&quot; BHP said.  </p>
<p>The company said the mine was using the opportunity to bring forward routine maintenance work at the mill.</p>
<p>Ok Tedi produces about 600,000 tonnes of copper concentrate a year which is shipped to customers in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>The concentrate is piped in a slurry from the mine to the port of Kiunga then sent by barge down the Fly River for loading onto a silo vessel in the Gulf of Papau. It is then transferred onto bulk carrier ships.</p>
<p>Last week copper smelters in Japan and Korea said June deliveries from the mine would be delayed.  </p>
<p>BHP has said the mine was talking to its customers about delaying delivery but at this stage was not considering enforcing force majeure as the situation could change quickly.</p>
<p>The mine has long term supply contracts with Germany's Norddeutsche Affinerie, Finland's Outokumpu Oy, Philippines Associated Smelting and Refining Corp (PASAR), South Korea's LG Metals Corp, Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and the Japanese Smelter Pool which consists of seven Japanese smelters. BHP owns 52.6 percent of the mine. The other partners are Canada's Inmet Mining Corp with 17.4 percent and the remainder held by the PNG government.  </p>
