<p>When Hong Kong's top judge shed his robes and wig to bid to lead the colony after its return to China, he brandished his neutrality as his trump card in a contest which had till then been a clash of business titans.</p>
<p>Ti Liang Yang, 67, proved the public's choice in the early days of lobbying, but few believe this will make any difference to the outcome of Wednesday's leadership contest.</p>
<p>The view in Hong Kong is that billionaire shipowner Tung Chee-hwa will seize victory in the vote conducted by a caucus of 400 China-picked selectors.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-born former chief justice, who resigned in September to run for the Chief Executive's post, emerged from the first round of voting last month with just 82 of the votes, well adrift of Tung's 206.</p>
<p>In third place was entrepreneur Peter Woo, the youngest of the contenders, who scraped through with 54.</p>
<p>Pragmatic Hong Kong people now appear to believe Yang has little chance of taking over from Governor Chris Patten when the British depart at midnight on June 30, 1997, and have sent his popularity rating plummeting.</p>
<p>Yang, who once had a lead of more than 10 percentage points over Tung as the public's top choice for future leader, scored only 28.8 points in the most recent poll on December 2.</p>
<p>Tung scored 46.7 points and Woo garnered just 5.2 points.</p>
<p>But the former judge, an avuncular figure who dropped his knighthood title &quot;Sir&quot; in October for plain &quot;Mr&quot;, has battled on.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were to become Chief Executive, I'm at the head of a moderate, relatively conservative government,&quot; Yang said.</p>
<p>But some say he is showing signs of preparing for defeat. He has ruled out a return to the judiciary -- telling reporters he cannot return having entered the world of politics -- but has said he is keen to continue in public service.</p>
<p>This is likely to be welcomed by the rank and file of Hong Kong who have praised Yang for his efforts to tap the poor and underprivileged for their views -- and have not held his previously silk-lined chauffeur-driven lifestyle against him.</p>
<p>&quot;What I can't accept is that we still have people living at places like these when Hong Kong has developed as a prosperous city,&quot; Yang, who admitted he had not travelled on a public bus for 20 years, said during a recent tour of a squatter area.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a shame for Hong Kong people.&quot;</p>
