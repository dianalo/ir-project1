<title>USA: Dangerous insecticide implicated in NY poisonings.</title>

<p>A highly controlled insecticide has been implicated in 24 cases of poisoning in New York, city officials said Friday.</p>
<p>Aldicarb, a potent chemical sold in the United States under the brand name Temik, is used to keep insects away from citrus, peanut and cotton crops, among other uses.</p>
<p>It is also the active ingredient in Tres Pasitos, a mouse and rodent poison sold illegally in New York stores in unlabelled containers, said John Gadd, a spokesperson for the city's health department. Tres Pasitos is produced in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>In the past two years, two dozen people have been poisoned after using Tres Pasitos in their homes, said Gadd. Twenty-one of those were hospitalized with symptoms of dizziness, sweating and shortness of breath, the agency reported.</p>
<p>&quot;Tres Pasitos is a very strong poison which can cause serious illness, and even death, in people and pets,&quot; said City Health Commissioner Dr. Benjamin Mojica.</p>
<p>Doctors at New York's Poison Control Centre said the patients they had seen had probably unknowingly ingested the chemical, which looks like granulated herbs.</p>
<p>&quot;We are worried people are not aware how poisonous this is,&quot; said Dr. Rama Rao, a fellow at the centre. &quot;It doesn't come with very good instructions.&quot;</p>
<p>Aldicarb is so toxic that farmers who use it bury it under the soil using a special implement so that wildlife will not be exposed to it, said Albert Heier, a spokesperson at the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. However, it leaves no residue in the crops.</p>
<p>The federal government has banned household use of the chemical and requires all agricultural users to register with their states, said Heier.</p>
