<title>Turkey: Turkish MP deserts Ciller's party in coalition row.</title>
<headline>Turkish MP deserts Ciller's party in coalition row.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-06-25</dateline>

<p>A renegade deputy resigned on Wednesday from Turkish conservative leader Tansu Ciller's True Path Party, boosting an attempt to set up an anti-Islamist coalition.</p>
<p>Parliament officials said deputy Hasan Denizkurdu announced his resignation in a four-page letter he sent to the speaker's office.</p>
<p>&quot;I am resigning from the party today to avoid going through a disciplinary process similar to the inquisition courts,&quot; his resignation statement said.</p>
<p>Denizkurdu was facing party disciplinary action for refusing to oppose prime minister-designate Mesut Yilmaz's bid to form a secularist government in place of the Islamist-led coalition established at the end of last June.</p>
<p>&quot;The coalition put a strain on the country before even completing its first year in office and the basic principles of the republic have become open to question,&quot; Denizkurdu said.</p>
<p>Despite the resignation, True Path officials said Ciller had gained assurances from a large majority of her MPs that they would not vote for Yilmaz's proposed coalition.</p>
<p>Yilmaz, leader of the main opposition Motherland Party, was to hold a news conference at noon (0900 GMT) in parliament on his bid to keep the Islamists out of power.</p>
<p>President Suleyman Demirel has appointed Yilmaz to form a coalition to replace the one-year-old government under Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who resigned last week under army pressure.</p>
<p>Yilmaz has given himself until early next week to present Demirel with a cabinet list.</p>
<p>He has won the backing of secularist MPs from most opposition parties but needs the support of around a dozen True Path deputies to win a vote of confidence in the 550-member parliament.</p>
<p>True Path leader Ciller, allied with the Welfare Party of Islamist leader Erbakan, on Tuesday rejected an offer from Yilmaz to join a coalition led by him.</p>
<p>Erbakan resigned to resolve a growing dispute with the military over religious activism. He had proposed the formation of a revamped coalition including his Islamists under Ciller's leadership.</p>
