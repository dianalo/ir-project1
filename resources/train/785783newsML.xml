<title>CYPRUS: Cyprus dismisses Turkey-northern Cyprus accord.</title>
<headline>Cyprus dismisses Turkey-northern Cyprus accord.</headline>

<p>Cyprus responded mildly on Thursday to an accord setting the wheels in motion for the partial integration of northern Cyprus with Turkey.</p>
<p>President Glafcos Clerides said the agreement signed on Wednesday was aimed at provoking Cyprus to boycott U.N.-sponsored talks next week on ways of resolving the conflict aplitting the Mediterranean island.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of the accord between Ankara and the self-styled regime in occupied Cyprus...is to get such a response from us as to (lead us) not to attend the talks,&quot; Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, told journalists.</p>
<p>The accord was for &quot;internal consumption,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and Clerides are due to meet in Montreux, Switzerland, on Monday, for a second round of United Nations-sponsored talks aimed at reviving negotiations on a comprehensive settlement which could reunite the island, divided since Turkey occupied its northern third in 1974.</p>
<p>Both leaders have said they will attend the talks, which are scheduled to run until August 16.</p>
<p>Wednesday's agreement, signed by the foreign ministers of Turkey and the north Cyprus administration, calls for an Association Council to work towards the partial economic and defence integration of Turkey with the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.</p>
<p>Ankara has warned it will unite the north with Turkey if accession talks begin next year between the Greek Cypriot-led government and the European Union.</p>
<p>Clerides and Denktash met in New York state under U.N. auspices last month in an attempt to revive stalled negotiations on reunifying Cyprus as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation.</p>
<p>They held informal follow-up talks in Nicosia last week where they agreed to exchange information on the location of graves of persons missing in hostilities between the two sides.</p>
<p>Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion which was in response to a coup in Nicosia backed by the military then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>The Turkish Cypriot state in the north, headed by Denktash, was declared in 1983 and is recognised only by Ankara.</p>
