<headline>CSCE coffee ends lightly traded session higher.</headline>

<p>CSCE coffee futures ended higher and toward the day's peaks on Wednesday, bolstered by a late-session round of trade and local buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said, however, activity remained slow, with only an estimated 5,742 lots changing hands on the day.</p>
<p>Benchmark September arabicas rose 5.05 cents per lb on the day, to 180.15, after ranging from 181.00 to 174.50. Spot July finished 2.00 cents higher, at 200.00, while the outer months closed up 0.50 to 3.05.</p>
<p>The July/September switch narrowed to 19.85 cents, from 22.90 cents at the close on Tuesday, while September/December widened to 22.75 cents compared with 20.75 cents.</p>
<p>Coffee prices were called to open 1.00-2.00 cents higher, but failed to reach their due and traded mixed for much of the session with local presence on both sides of the market.</p>
<p>A late push to breach near-term resistance at 180.00 cents in the September contract was successful, however, and traders anticipate buying to spill over to Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a positive close,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I expect follow-through buying tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>On the charts, traders said the September contract would now face resistance at 185.00 cents, followed by 192.00-194.00 cents. On the downside, near-term support was seen at 174.00, with major support for September was seen at 168.75 cents, a low reached last week.</p>
<p>Although there was little in the way of fresh fundamental input, traders said dwindling exchange-certified coffee stocks continued to underpin the market.</p>
<p>After Wednesday's close, CSCE reported certified coffee stocks fell by 248 60-kg bags as of June 24, to 45,927 bags. There were 10,387 bags pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>In the longer term, Smith Barney analyst Walt Spilka said he expects stocks of coffee will continue to decline and become very tight again in the August-October period ahead the harvest of many new-crop coffees.</p>
