<p>Bullish comments from British Petroleum Co Plc at an analysts' meeting earlier today prompted some industry watchers to up their 1998 and 1999 profit estimates.</p>
<p>However none have yet decided on the level of the hike.</p>
<p>Others said they were also impressed with the bullish BP comments, but believed it was too early to have a detailed look at their forecasts beyond this year or next.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very good presentation, but it is a bit too early to look at 1998 and certainly at 1999, while 2000 is a long way away yet,&quot; said Rod McLean at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be some numbers moved up out to 1999, but that's not going to affect the market very much,&quot; he added, echoing a widely held view.</p>
<p>Shares in BP closed 7-1/2 pence lower at 703 after the oil giant drew a bright picture of notably its upstream operations.</p>
<p>BP said it could be producing 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day within the next decade, an increase of a million barrels a day on current output.</p>
<p>The company said it expected to maintain production in its two established areas -- the North Sea and Alaska --, while pumping up more oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico and South America.</p>
<p>New operations in the Caspian area, north and west Africa and Asia should also help lift production to two thirds above current levels, BP said.</p>
<p>&quot;The production profile is growing at a slightly faster pace than I had originally thought,&quot; said Williams de Broe analyst Peter Hitchens.</p>
<p>BP also said that its target to improve underlying annual income by $1.5 billion a year could be met by 1999, which would be one year ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>But analysts said this was already widely expected after the company delivered $600 million towards that target in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very good story, very well told, but also very well known,&quot; said one analyst, who declined to be named.</p>
