<p>Polish shares are seen rising next week unless Friday's U.S. jobless data shows high employment and causes Dow falls due to expected U.S. interest rate rises, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If today's information is good and would delay the possibility of an interest rate rise...I think we could have rises next week,&quot; said Kamil Kalemba, a trader at ING Barings in Warsaw.</p>
<p>(The U.S. figures, issued shortly afterwards, were close to market forecasts and did little to dispel expectations of further U.S. interest rate rises.)</p>
<p>Other analysts played down the influence of the U.S. bourse, saying steep Warsaw falls earlier this week largely represented a deeper correction after the market had risen to a three-year high at 18,339.4 points on February 18.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was overheated after rising so much this year,&quot; said Piotr Leszczuk, an analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage. The market started this year at 14,342.8 points.</p>
<p>It fell 6.1 percent this week to 15,670.2.</p>
<p>Analysts were bullish on the construction sector, which was seen benefiting from this year's better weather and increased demand, though Tomasz Berent of IB Austria Securities said such factors might already have been priced in.</p>
<p>They said more information on the earnings fate of builders and other industrials would come on Tuesday in the form of the Central Statistics Office's March business climate indicator.</p>
<p>Analysts said the main market's biggest loser this week, debt-ridden builder Espebepe, fell 19 percent as speculators continued to play on the firm's unclear fate.</p>
<p>The firm, which has 75 million zlotys in debt and a creditors' meeting due on April 14, surged 41.9 percent last week after the previous week's steep fall.</p>
<p>The only blue chip among the loss leaders, BRE, fell 15.2 percent largely due to its downward mid-week revision of 1996 net profit.</p>
<p>Analysts said Kredyt Bank, which rose three percent on the week and was the main market's top gainer, should continue to benefit from Friday's news it had won a tender to buy Polish Investment Bank (PBI) and Prosper Bank.</p>
