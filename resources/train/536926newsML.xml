<text>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department said Thursday it approved Bell Atlantic Corp.'s huge merger with Nynex Corp., the last major hurdle facing the $23 billion deal announced a year ago.</p>
<p>The newly created carrier would be the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company, behind only long-distance giant AT&amp;T Corp. The department's antitrust division spent months probing the transaction to determine if it would block competition in the phone business.  </p>
<p>&quot;The division has decided that it will not challenge the transaction, having concluded that the merger does not violate the antitrust laws,&quot; the Justice Department said in a brief statement.</p>
<p>The department -- contrary to the predictions of many antitrust experts -- did not impose any conditions on the merger.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission also must sign off on the deal. But the Justice Department's clearance is expected to spur FCC officials to conclude that the merger is in the public's interest.</p>
<p>The new Bell Atlantic would serve a territory extending from Maine to Virginia. It would rank 23rd on Fortune magazine's list of the 500 largest U.S. corporations, with combined revenues of nearly $30 billion. It would operate about 40 million phone lines around the globe, with about 37 million of those lines here in the United States.</p>
