<title>USA: Blue-chip stocks fall in profit-taking.</title>
<headline>Blue-chip stocks fall in profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks fell Wednesday as investors took profits after two consecutive sessions of record closes and as long-term bond interest rates continued to rise.</p>
<p>The dollar rallied on gloomy economic forecasts in Germany and news that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had been hospitalized. Oil prices rose as traders focused on forecasts for extended cold weather.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 51.18 points at 6,549.48, one day after finishing above the 6,600 level for the first time. The Dow also set a record Monday.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,272 to 1,238 on active volume of 556 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happened in the last few days is stocks have lost their cushion,&quot; said Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan. &quot;With bond yields backing up the way they have, I would characterise stocks as fully valued.&quot;</p>
<p>Concerns about interest rates, which resurfaced in force after a surprisingly strong National Association of Purchasing Management report last week, have intensified ahead of two key economic reports due later this week -- the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday and monthly employment figures on Friday.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 face value, and its yield rose to 6.84 percent from 6.79 percent Tuesday. The yield moves in the opposite direction of the price.</p>
<p>While stocks have shown increased volatility this week, the market has essentially run in place. The Dow's loss Wednesday left it virtually unchanged from its opening Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is waiting for some event to give it a catalyst,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot;I think the best candidate will be the employment data on Friday, but it could come from the PPI.&quot;</p>
<p>In a pattern becoming almost routine lately in stocks, the session was marked by a wave of computerized programme trades, seven over the day, according to Birinyi Associates, a firm that tracks programme trading.</p>
<p>The dollar posted a two-year high against the German mark and a 30-month peak against the Swiss franc as investors unloaded European currencies in favour of the more stable U.S. currency.</p>
<p>The dollar rose as high as 1.5787 marks, its highest since January 1995, before ending at 1.5740, up from 1.5642 late Tuesday. The dollar also rose to 1.3635 Swiss francs from 1.3535, and to 115.76 Japanese yen from 115.25 late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Oil prices also rose as traders reacted to predictions of cold weather later this week and next week and shurgged off sharp rises in oil product inventories last week.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, February heating oil futures changed direction to end 0.94 cent higher at 73.43 cents a gallon. February crude oil futures closed 39 cents higher at $26.62 a barrel.</p>
<p>February unleaded gasoline rose 0.09 cent a gallon to 72.19 cents.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE closed 8.7 points higher at 4,087.5. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 average shed 215.81 points or 1.14 percent to close at 18,680.38.</p>
