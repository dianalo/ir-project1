<headline>Israel reveals Lebanon anti-guerrilla unit.</headline>

<p>The Israeli army on Wednesday revealed an elite military unit that has been secretly combatting anti-Israel guerrillas in south Lebanon.</p>
<p>Major General Amiram Levine, Israeli army northern commander, said the unit, code-named Egoz (Hebrew for 'nut'), had killed at least 16 guerrillas in the course of a year.</p>
<p>Levine told Israel Radio:&quot;This is a regular army unit. A good unit. It only operates in uniform. It does not operate against civilians, it does not operate with the goal of capturing criminals. It is an army unit that fights terrorists.&quot;</p>
<p>The radio said that two members of the unit were killed in the course of its operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Hizbollah and other terrorists suffered at least 16 dead from the Egoz unit over a year during many operations,&quot; Levin said.</p>
<p>An Israeli army statement said the unit was founded two years ago under the Golani Brigade of the Israeli army and that it specialised in guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982. It carved out a 15-km (nine mile) -wide south Lebanon occupation zone as a buffer against guerrillas when it withdrew the bulk of its forces in 1985.</p>
<p>Pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas and fighters from other Lebanese and radical Palestinian organisations are fighting to oust Israel from the zone which is patrolled by some 1,000 Israeli soldiers and about 3,000 troops from Israel's client South Lebanon Army militia.</p>
<p>Israel operated special undercover army units in the West Bank and Gaza Strip against Palestinian activists waging a revolt against Israeli occupation between 1987 and 1993.</p>
<p>Soldiers from those units, code-named Samson and Cherry, often disguised themselves as Arabs while pursuing activists. Palestinians accused the units of acting as execution squads. The Israeli army denied the charge.</p>
