<headline>German SMH to become full investment bank.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-10-15</dateline>

<p>Schroeder Muenchmeyer Hengst &amp; Co, the German bank controlled by Britain's Lloyds Bank group, on Tuesday said it planned to focus primarily on investment banking in future and would cut staff by 10 percent.</p>
<p>In a statement, SMH said it would scale down its lending business and focus on three core activities -- institutional brokerage and asset management and retail securities business -- as well as expand corporate finance and dealing business.  </p>
<p>The bank said it would no longer grant loans carrying &quot;entrepreneurial risk&quot;, but approve only those backed with water-tight guarantees and that its lending business would in future merely support other activities.</p>
<p>The restructuring would play to its strengths, the bank said: &quot;SMH is convinced that this will lay the basis for a successful future.&quot;</p>
<p>The personnel restructuring would be completed by the end of 1997 and would entail the loss of around ten percent of jobs, SMH said. The bank, one of Germany's oldest and now 75-percent owned by Lloyds, employed 450 at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>One of SMH's co-owners, Eberhard Weiershaeuser, would leave the bank at the end of 1996 as his areas of operations would be discontinued. His role as joint speaker for the management board would be taken over by Ulrich Schuette.</p>
<p>SMH said, however, that Weiershaeuser would continue to support the bank and had been instrumental in developing its new direction.</p>
