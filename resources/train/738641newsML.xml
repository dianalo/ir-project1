<p>Max the gorilla was undergoing surgery after being shot three times by a terrified robber who jumped into his enclosure in Johannesburg zoo while trying to escape from police, zoo officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 190kg (418 pound) gorilla was hit three times in the lower face and veterinary surgeons undertook a delicate operation to remove bullet fragments, spokeswoman Jacqui Thompson said.</p>
<p>&quot;All his vital signs are stable. They've removed part of a piece of bullet and they're still busy working on the other two bullet wounds,&quot; she told South African radio.</p>
<p>Two of the three policemen who entered the enclosure to capture the robber, who was wounded by police gunfire during the chase, were bitten on the rump, hand and arm by the gorillas and were being treated in hospital.</p>
