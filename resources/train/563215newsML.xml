<p>Carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, blamed for changing the world's climate, should increase to 9.7 billion tonnes annually by 2015, up 61 percent from 1990 levels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Even if industrialized countries could stabilize their pollution at 1990 levels -- a target being discussed in international negotiations -- emissions still would increase by 2.5 billion tons over the next two decades, the EIA said in its annual international outlook.</p>
<p>Industrialized countries are trying to reach an agreement by next December on how to stem pollution from burning oil, coal and other fossil fuels that traps heat in the atmosphere, with potentially disastrous results for the world's climate.</p>
<p>But while industrialized countries are talking about reducing their pollution, two thirds of growth in energy use through 2015 will occur in developing economies, and economies in transition such as China and Mexico, the EIA said.</p>
<p>Energy growth in developing countries in Asia should average 4.2 percent annually, compared with 1.3 percent annual growth in industrialized countries, the outlook said.  </p>
<p>By 2000, carbon emissions in the non-industrialized countries should pass industrialized countries' and will be about two thirds of the total increase in emissions worldwide, partly because of developing nations' heavy reliance on coal.</p>
<p>The EIA report said the world's use of all sources of energy, other than nuclear power, should grow, with total energy use expected to be up 54 percent in 2015 from 1995's levels.</p>
<p>Most of the energy growth should be in fossil fuels, which produce the climate-changing carbon emissions, while the share of other types of energy sources such as hydroelectric power is projected to slip, it said.</p>
<p>Per capita energy use in industrialized countries should stay fairly steady over the two decades, but in some emerging economies such as China and India, per capita energy use may double.</p>
<p>Still, per capita use in developing countries will be less than 20 percent of the average for industrialized countries, the EIA outlook said.</p>
