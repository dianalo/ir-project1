<headline>UK bank lending rises 1.040 bln stg in April - BBA.</headline>

<p>Total sterling lending by major British banking groups to the private sector rose a seasonally adjusted 1.040 billion stg in April, the British Bankers Association said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>That was well below the 5.157 billion stg increase seen in March and the underlying six monthly average of about 2.8 billion stg.</p>
<p>The BBA said April's figure incorporated a decline of some 1.3 billion stg by way of reverse repos.</p>
<p>But individuals increased their borrowing by 1.232 billion stg, up from 1.046 billion in March.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no slowing in the momentum of the major banks' lending to persons in April,&quot; said Tim Sweeney, the BBA's director general. &quot;In fact, at 1.2 billion, this was the second largest monthly rise since the series began.&quot;</p>
<p>The BBA said mortgage lending rose by 740 million stg in April, virtually flat with March and close to the recent monthly average of 728 million.</p>
<p>Consumer credit climbed by 497 million stg, with credit cards responsible for 127 million of that -- well up on March's &quot;relatively weak&quot; 311 million increase.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer credit recovered very strongly,&quot; Sweeney said.</p>
<p>Lending to the financial sector showed a marked rise, up 968 million pounds, but that was well down on the record 1.708 billion rise seen in March.</p>
<p>Notable increases were recorded by leasing companies, securities dealers and insurance and pension funds.</p>
<p>Lending to the manufacturing sector was little changed but there were significant rises for property compenaies and &quot;other retail distribution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Elsewhere, demand for finance was fairly muted, in part due to a market decline in gilt repo activity,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;Therefore, overall, the major banks' lending showed only a modest rise, in contrast to the record figure in March.&quot;</p>
