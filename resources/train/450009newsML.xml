<p>China's B share indices ended down but the A share indices were up on Tuesday with little impact seen from new provisions on securities-related crime, brokers said.</p>
<p>China has added provisions on securities-related crimes to its criminal law to help curb insider trading and price manipulation on the financial markets, the Shanghai Securites News reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Shanghai's B index fell 0.018 points or 0.03 percent to 70.88 on volume of 20.151 million shares worth $10.448 million.</p>
<p>Brokers said falls of Heilongjiang Electric Power and losses on the A share market later in the session erased early gains, but active institutional support for real estate developer Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development prevented the market from further losses.</p>
<p>Heilongjiang fell $0.036 or 2.63 percent to $0.740 after it proposed a 0.17325 yuan per share dividend for B share holders based on its 1996 net profit of 124.92 million yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Lujiazui traded the most and became the star on institutional buying, rising $0.026 or 2.78 percent to $0.960 on volume of 3.6 million shares.</p>
<p>Textile machinery maker Shanghai Erfangji was the biggest loser on expectations of poor 1996 results, slipping $0.010 or 5.55 percent to $0.170 on volume of 945,600 shares.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's B share index shed 0.34 points or 0.20 percent to 169.65 points on turnover of HK$216.7 million.</p>
<p>&quot;What we saw in the afternoon session is just a minor correction,&quot; a broker said. &quot;The market will continue its upward trend after the correction.&quot;</p>
<p>On the B share market, Shenzhen Chiwan Petroleum Supply Base Co Ltd was the biggest loser, down HK$0.13 or 2.64 percent to HK$4.80 on volume of 693,900 shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai A shares ended up, but off intraday highs on profit-taking, triggered by investor concerns over possible government intervention to cool down the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index gained 4.477 points or 0.37 percent to 1,217.230 on volume of 977.8 million shares worth 11.9 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE30 index rose 20.178 points or 0.63 percent to 3,235.234 points.</p>
<p>Tientsin Marine Shipping was the star on talk about its dividend plans, surging 1.25 yuan or 10.01 percent to 13.73 on volume of 2.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's A share index inched up 2.05 points or 0.48 percent to 425.7 points on turnover of 12.4 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Hunan Zhenghong Feed Co Ltd, which listed 45 million shares on Tuesday, closed at 18.98 yuan compared with an offering price of 7.06 yuan, on volume of 27.0 million shares.</p>
<p>(1$ = 7.75 HK dollars, 8.3 yuan)</p>
