<p>French advertising agency BDDP, bought last year by Britain's The GGT Group Plc, needs to become a global actor and will make acquisitions to achieve this, Michael Greenlees, GGT chairman, said in an interview published on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;BBDP must become a worldwide actor. To achieve that, we need to look at the sectors in which we should reinforce our presence,&quot; he told advertising industry weekly Strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term we will develop through organic growth in markets where we are already present, such as in Europe. But the repositioning could also involve acquisitions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said BBDP had just finalised the purchase of Godenrath Preiswerk &amp; Partner (GPP) in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;This allows us to double our revenues and become one of the 20 top agencies in Germany,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>BDDP had encountered problems in Germany because it was too small, he said, adding BDDP also wanted to extend its presence in central Europe and Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Poland.</p>
<p>It would also look at emerging markets like Latin America and wants to develop in Southeast Asia, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In time, GGT will become more and more a financial holding company. Nevertheless we do not want to group all our activities under the BDDP banner,&quot; he said.</p>
