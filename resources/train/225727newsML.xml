<p>Norwegian shipbuilder and engineering group Kvaerner ASA said on Friday it had won a $1 billion order to build two 3,100-passenger cruise liners, the world's largest.</p>
<p>The company said it was its biggest ever shipbuilding contract.</p>
<p>Kvaerner said Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines Ltd had ordered the vessels, which will each have a gross tonnage of 130,000 tonnes and a passenger capacity of 3,100.</p>
<p>They will be more than twice the size of the Queen Elizabeth 2, the flagship of Kvaerner's passenger shipping division Cunard.</p>
<p>The largest passenger vessels currently under construction are between 105,000 and 110,000 gross tonnes.</p>
<p>Market speculation over the deal boosted Kvaerner's A share eight crowns on Thursday. The stock rose a further 13 crowns to a high of 273 crowns following the announcement before settling back to 267.50 crowns at 1246 GMT.</p>
<p>The B share was eight crowns higher at 246.50 crowns.</p>
<p>The ships will be built at the group's Kvaerner Masa-Yards in Turku, Finland. Temporary yard subsidiaries in Finland made it possible for Kvaerner Masa-Yards to be competitive against other European and Japanese yards, the company said.</p>
<p>Delivery is scheduled for 1999 and 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;This is very good news for Kvaerner and reinforces the company's position as the the leading shipbuilder in the world,&quot; said company spokesman Paul Emberley.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding is Kvaerner's most profitable division and booked a pre-tax profit of 750 million crowns ($117 million) in the first nine months of 1996, almost 90 percent of the company's total result for period. ($1=6.409 Norwegian Crown)</p>
