<headline>UK's Bardon and Camas to merge.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-14</dateline>

<p>British-based building materials companies Bardon Group Plc and Camas Plc said on Monday they planned to merge to form a new group to be called Aggregate Industries.</p>
<p>Camas shareholders will own 52 percent of the new company and will receive two new Bardon shares for each Camas share, the companies said in a joint statement. The new company would have had combined sales of 656 million pounds ($1.1 billion) if it had been in place in 1996.  </p>
<p>The companies said the all-share deal would create a substantial UK/U.S. aggregates group with combined reserves of 2.2 billion tonnes as at December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>They said rationalisation was expected to produce cost savings of at least 10 million pounds a year, and promised &quot;further operational synergies over the medium term&quot; would add significantly to shareholder value.</p>
<p>Maurice Warren of Camas will be chairman of Aggregate Industries and Bardon's Peter Tom will be chief executive, with the new board comprising a balance of Bardon and CAMAS directors.</p>
<p>Maurice Warren said, &quot;This merger represents an outstanding opportunity to bring together two focused, aggregates businesses operating in similar markets. The commercial rationale is compelling.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter Tom said, &quot;The operational benefits and opportunities from the merger are expected to be substantial. Aggregate Industries will have a strong capital structure, a substantial consented reserve base and an experienced management team from which to deliver long term value to shareholders.&quot; ($ = 0.614 British Pounds)</p>
