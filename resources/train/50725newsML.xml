<title>BELGIUM: Foreign buying lifts 10-year Belgian bond.</title>
<headline>Foreign buying lifts 10-year Belgian bond.</headline>

<p>The benchmark 2006 Belgian linear bond was boosted in morning trading on Thursday, with the yield falling four basis points and the spread over Bunds narrowing two basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;One foreign house bought about five billion (francs) of the 10-years,&quot; one trader said, adding that this had a knock-on effect on surrounding maturities.</p>
<p>He said the reason for the buying seemed to be anticipation of the Bund breaking up through resistance at 97.25, with the likelihood of an ensuing rally.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was largely quiet elsewhere.  </p>
<p>Traders said everyone was waiting for the U.S. August Producer Price Index due at 1230 GMT on Thursday, and the Consumer Price Index due at the same time on Friday.</p>
<p>The PPI figures are seen up 0.1 percent month-on-month and up 2.8 percent year-on-year. The CPI figures are seen flat month-on-month, and up 1.3 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Traders said the markets were also waiting to see what kind of magic the government could perform to massage the national budget into shape ready for the European Union's single currency due to start in 1999. The government has to find savings of at least 100 billion francs for the 1997 budget.  </p>
<p>The benchmark 2006 OLO yielded 6.51 percent, down from Wednesday's 6.55. The premium over Bunds narrowed two basis points to 22.</p>
<p>The frontmonth futures contract was 20 basis points up at 117.44, in a 117.45/117.29 range.</p>
