<p>U.S. municipal bond prices lost about 1/4 point overall Wednesday, moving lower with Treasuries but again performing with less volatility than the government market.</p>
<p>The Treasury long bond was off 16/32 at 95-27/32 heading into the New York close, to yield 6.83 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There is cash selling in our market but it isn't overwhelming,&quot; one municipal trader said. Most of the downturn came in the afternoon, with the market virtually unchanged in morning action.</p>
<p>Traders continued to cite extremely low new issue volume and a lack of significant economic data this week as factors keeping a lid on activity.</p>
<p>March municipal bond futures ended 19/32 lower at 114-17/32, while the March U.S. Treasury bond futures contract slipped 15/32 to 111-1/32. The MOB spread was 112 ticks, compared to 116 ticks at the close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Actively traded issues in the secondary market included Delaware River Port Authority FGIC 5-1/2s of 2026, which were bid at a 5.67 percent net yield, down three basis points.</p>
<p>Houston water and sewer FGIC 5-3/8s of 2027 were unchanged at 5.79 percent net.</p>
<p>In competitive action, Lehman Brothers won $150 million Port Authority of New York and New Jersey AMT bonds, reoffering the 2014 maturity 5.65 percent.</p>
<p>Prudential Securities Inc won a second $150 million port offering, which was not subject to the AMT. </p>
