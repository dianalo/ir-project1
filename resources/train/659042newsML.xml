<title>SLOVAKIA: Liquidity crunch to keep Slovak rates up - analysts.</title>
<headline>Liquidity crunch to keep Slovak rates up - analysts.</headline>

<p>Slovak short-term interbank rates on Friday traded above 33 percent due to a continuing liquidity shortage and dealers said they did not expect a significant change in rates over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Money market dealers said only one-day maturities were being traded with rates ranging between 33 to 38 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still short of crown liquidity and it is now certain that the banking sector will not meet its minimum reserve requirements on Friday,&quot; said Martin Hrozany of Credit Lyonnais.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS), which has kept the market short to shore up the crown, has been gradually adding crowns through short-term repo tenders, offering five bilion crowns on Friday.</p>
<p>But dealers say the volumes are too small to improve market liquidity. According to NBS figures, the banking sector on the whole lacked 28.62 percent of neccessary funds to meet the reserve requirement deadline on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the NBS will further keep the market short of crown liquidity during the next reserve period and that is why rates will remain so high,&quot; Hrozany said.</p>
<p>Traders said high rates have started to attract foreign investors playing on interest rate differential against hard currencies which could help increase crown liquidity.</p>
<p>Funds totalling three to five billion crowns are expected to flow into the market from the NBS over the next two weeks as local banks sell hard currency flowing in from abroad at the central bank fixing.</p>
<p>The NBS on Thursday fixed the crown at 33.440 to the dollar and at 19.405 to the mark, implying a deviation against the mark/dollar basket parity of -0.42 percent.</p>
<p>The Slovak crown moved in a narrow range around -0.16 percent versus its basket midpoint on Friday morning and dealers said it could strengthen on continuing foreign demand.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) the basket midpoint will be a strong resistance for crown's firming,&quot; said Tibor Fratrik of ING Bank.</p>
