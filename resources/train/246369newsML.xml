<p>Flagging exports and a move out of U.S. stocks by foreign investors drove the U.S. current account deficit to a new high in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The gap in the current account, the broadest measure of the nation's trade performance, widened 19 percent from the second quarter to a record $47.96 billion in the three months from July through September.</p>
<p>That surpassed the previous record shortfall of $43.2 billion set nearly nine years earlier during the fourth quarter of 1987.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said foreigners were switching out of U.S. stocks into bonds during the third quarter while exports of American-made goods posted their first quarterly drop in three years.</p>
<p>&quot;The current account is deteriorating, and what is worrisome is the trend,&quot; said economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. He said some contributing influences like rising imports of petroleum and consumer goods show few signs of leveling off soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports are rising while exports are not doing as well as they were and (deficits on) investment income from stocks and bonds have jumped significantly,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The current account is the country's broadest trade statistic because it measures business with the rest of the world not only in goods and services, but also takes into account investment flows between countries and grants made to foreign nations.</p>
<p>While the Commerce Department tracks trade in goods and services on a monthly basis, the quarterly current account report is the only look at investment flows between the United States and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Virtually every aspect of trade performed more weakly in the third quarter and contributed to the rising deficit.</p>
<p>The gap in goods and services grew to $33.8 billion from $28.6 billion in the second quarter. The department said exports of goods were weaker while imports increased and a surplus in services tailed off because of declines in travel and passenger fares.</p>
<p>Exports of U.S. goods dropped $3.2 billion from the second quarter to $150 billion, the first such quarterly drop since a $2.8 billion fall in the third quarter of 1993, Commerce Department officials said.</p>
<p>The shortfall in investment income -- the difference between foreign-earned income reaching the United States and income flowing out of the country --- more than doubled to $4.7 billion during the third quarter from $2.3 billion in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Weaker trade acts as a drag on national economic growth. The government already has reported that gross domestic product slowed abruptly to a 2 percent anual rate of expansion in the third quarter from 4.7 percent in the second.</p>
<p>Sohn of Norwest Corp. said there was &quot;one positive strand of thought&quot; to be seen in a fading current account, since slower economic growth may weaken the dollar's value if imports tail off and so boost U.S. industries' competitive position.</p>
<p>U.S. automakers particularly have complained that strength in the dollar -- some of it engineered by foreign nations like Japan buying U.S. Treasury securities to keep their currencies low, according to Sohn -- was making their products relatively more costly and harder to sell.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said income receipts from U.S.-owned assets overseas increased slightly to $48.3 billion from $48 billion in the second quarter. But income payments from dividends, interest and other sources on foreign-owned assets in the United States climbed strongly to $53 billion in the third quarter from $50.3 billion in the second.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. government payments rose strongly, reflecting substantial foreign acquisitions of U.S. Treasury securities in recent quarters,&quot; the department said.</p>
<p>Net foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were a record $42 billion in the third quarter, compared with $31.2 billion in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The department said the jump &quot;partly reflected a shift in investor preferences from stocks to bonds&quot; during the third quarter.</p>
