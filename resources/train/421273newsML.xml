<headline>Swiss shares extend gains to close at record high.</headline>
<text>
<p>1540 GMT - Swiss shares set a new closing high, propelled by gains on Wall Street and the German Dax index.</p>
<p>Dealers said momentum increased in the second half of the session as U.S. bond and stock markets recovered. Shares firmed despite weakness in Swiss government bond futures.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a feeling that the recent conslidation is over,&quot; one trader said, adding there was ample liquidity in the share market due to the lack of investment alternatives.</p>
<p>* The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended up 33.4 points, or 0.74 percent, at 4,547.1 points, topping the previous record close of 4,539.0 points set on February 26.  </p>
<p>* The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) advanced 20.39 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,890.83. Volume was described as heavy. One dealer said gains in SMI futures also underpinned cash stocks. March SMI futures rose 35.5 points to 4,552.5. The outlook still was favourable, traders said.</p>
<p>* Profit-taking erased some of the initial gains of CS Group, which reported a 1996 net loss of 2.432 billion Swiss francs. News of a larger than expected loss, after an extensive restructuring last year, was largely offset by a positive outlook. CS Group led the actives list, falling 0.25 francs to 158.25 after an early rise to 161.  </p>
<p>Dealers said financials were sought initially, but the buying spree later extended to industrials as well.</p>
<p>* SBC jumped six francs or more than two percent, to 290. UBS bearers were up 12 francs at 1,340. Major insurers Zurich, Swiss Re and Winterthur were all more than one percent higher.</p>
<p>* Share rights on Ciba Specialty Chemicals jumped 1.60 franc to 99.00. Novartis registered shares added nine francs to 1,710. Roche recovered from early weakness, adding 60 francs to 12,320.</p>
<p>* Watchmaker SMH and Chemical firm EMS ended lower.  </p>
<p>* On the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange Soffex, UBS options were once again sought, dealers said.</p>
<p>Of a total of 143,961 options traded, UBS accounted for more than 21,000 contracts. UBS options are among the most liquid securities on Soffex, a dealer said. Demand was also high for Nestle calls due to one single big transaction, a dealer said. Around 37,000 Nestle calls were traded.</p>
<p>Volume in SMI futures reached 5,346 contracts.</p>
