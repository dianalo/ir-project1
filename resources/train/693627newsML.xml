<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - June 27-----------------</p>
<p>The next near-term direction in the copper market is unclear, though prices are likely to experience volatile trading on Friday, traders and chartists said.</p>
<p>Aluminium is expected to remain range-bound but will closely monitor the movements of copper, they added  </p>
<p>COPPER - Choppy and nervous trading is expected on Friday following this week's fall to a seven-week low of $2,355 a tonne and subsequent recovery to levels around $2,400, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Martin Squires of London Metal Exchange (LME) brokers Rudolf Wolff said, &quot;Copper trading currently is not for the faint-hearted.&quot;</p>
<p>News that Inco had struck a deal with striking workers at its Sudbury, Ontario mine had little impact in early copper trading. According to Inco's 1997 production plan, the Ontario division was expected to produce about 200 million pounds of copper and 230 million pounds of nickel.</p>
<p>Traders said nickel was also little moved, believing that a strike settlement had already been factored into the price.</p>
<p>With critically low stocks and the current threats to production underpinned by the widening spread, copper still has the potential to spike back up to $2,600 or even higher, Squires said.</p>
<p>He placed support at $2,350.</p>
<p>There have been concerns over the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea, which remains closed due to dry weather, and over production from mines in Chile, affected by recent snow.</p>
<p>LME brokers Brandeis said the market had become seriously oversold.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices could tumble to $2,250 and lower if key support coincident with the major uptrend line at $2,355 is broken,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>At 0700 GMT three months LME copper was quoted at $2,400/05, against Thursday's late London close of $2,399/$2,404.</p>
<p>ALUMINIUM - Seen consolidating but will closely eye developments in the copper market. Support is likely to be found from recent falls in LME stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Although prices bounced well from the lows (Thursday) the market remains range-bound,&quot; Brandeis said. They pegged resistance from the 10-day moving average at $1,582 and believed that prices would need to breach $1,605 for the market to move higher.</p>
<p>On the downside support is expected at Thursday's low of $1,570, followed by $1,545.</p>
<p>At 0700 GMT three months aluminium was quoted at $1,575/79, versus $1,576/79.</p>
