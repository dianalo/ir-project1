<p>U.S. Plains fed cattle markets were quiet early Monday, with no reported bids or sales, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Owners were pricing cattle at $66.00 to $67.00 per cwt, following heavy trading last week mostly at $65.00, they said.</p>
<p>Packers were comfortable with live inventories after last week's big sales and will take their time buying, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a few buyers out in the lot checking inventory and I wouldn't be surprised to see them bid $63.00 to $64.00, but I don't expect to see anything trade at those levels,&quot; a Kansas feedlot manager said.  </p>
<p>Sales last week depleted showlists and near the second largest trading day record in Kansas on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Attempts at trading higher this week could be restrained by Friday's bearishly-construed USDA monthly Cattle on Feed Report, market sources said. The data showed many more cattle on feed as of August 1 than expected and July placements well above trade expectations.</p>
<p>USDA said in the seven key cattle feeding states, the number of cattle in feedlots with capacities of 1,000 head or more had 19 percent more cattle on feed than a year earlier, while July placements were up 18 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Weakness from the report could offset potential support from higher beef prices late last week, the sources said.</p>
