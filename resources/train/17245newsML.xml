<p>Italy's largest listed food group Paramlat announced that its recent 370 billion lire one-for-five share rights issue made at 1,500 lire a share had been 99.56 percent taken-up.</p>
<p>The company launched the cash call involving the issue of 246.9 million new ordinary shares between July 22 and August 21. The shares not taken up will be offered on the bourse between August 29 and September 4.</p>
<p>The amount of the issue was set after taking into account the 94.8 million warrants which were pre-converted at a price of 1,000 lire each between May 27 and June 27.</p>
<p>The Tanzi family company Coloniale, Parmalat's majority shareholder with just over a 50 percent stake in the group, undertook to subscribe for at least 50 percent of the rights to maintain its shareholding in the company.</p>
