<headline>OPINION - Ivan Wong comments on Malaysian palm oil.</headline>
<text>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Jul 14 - In this report we would like to digress from our usual CPO sypply-demand balnce format. We would look instead at a consolidated palm oil (CPO+PPO) supply-demand balnce in order to focus on palm oil disappearance. More specifically, we would examine the discrepancy between PORLA and department of statistics figures on exports disappearance. On several occasions in the past we had commented on PORLA's palm oil export figures being understand and the derived domestic disappearance figures abnormally/unrealistically high. example, our reports of 21/3 and 21/4.  </p>
<p>Figures we have from department of statistics for the months January-March show palm oil exports of 1,611,946 tonnes as compared to Porla's final figures of 1,513,215 tonnes. For the first-3 months this year, PORLA's palm oil exports figures fell short of statistics by 98,731 tonnes or an average of 32,910 tonnes a month. As shown in the supply-demand balnce above, PORLA's figures generated an abnormally high domestic utilisation figure of 362,000 tonnes in January-March or an average of 120,666 tonnes a month.  </p>
<p>Statistics figures on the other hand presented a utilisation of 263,000 tonnes or an average of 87,666 tonnes a month. Deducting offtake by oleochemical plants amounting to 99,300 tonnes in January-March, domestic consumption of palm oil (inclusive of refining losses) thus worked out to be only 54,570 tonnes a month. The monthly domestic utilisation figures of 147,000 tonnes in April and 151,000 tonnes in May derived from PORLA's palm oil exports figures thus also appear to be overstated.  </p>
<p>For the month of June our estimated palm oil stocks of 795,000 tonnes assumed domestic utilisation of 110,000 tonnes and palm oil exports of 595,000 tonnes. Stocks of PK/PKO are estimated to be up around 5,000 tonnes, oil basis. Our final estimate on CPO production in June is revised to 788,000 tonnes from 785,000 tonnes estimated a week ago. Production in Peninsular Malaysia rose around 2 percent but in East Malaysia it was down about 6 percent. For the week ended July 11 CPO futures fell 45-39 ringgit. Following the release of our last report price dropped 40-33 ringgit in the first-2 days.  </p>
<p>The weakness may also be attributed to concern over increased price competition from Indonesia following the revision of the country's export duty structure on CPO and PPO which significantly lowered duties to as low as 2 percent AD valorem (RBD Olein) or to rather nominal amounts as compared to duties payable under the previous structure. September CPO futures settled at 1,128 ringgit after an intra week low of 1,120 ringgit.</p>
