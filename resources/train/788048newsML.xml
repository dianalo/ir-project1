<title>UNITED NATIONS: American chosen for rights probe in Kabila's Congo.</title>

<p>An American human rights expert, Reed Brody, was named on Friday as the third member of a U.N. team probing alleged massacres of Rwandan refugees in President Laurent Kabila's Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement the team would meet in Geneva on Aug. 13-15 and then leave for Kinshasa.</p>
<p>He previously named two African experts for the controversial mission, formed after Kabila refused to let anoter U.N. team into the country because of objections to a critical report from its leader, Roberto Garreton, a respected Chilean human rights lawyer.</p>
<p>Brody, an international lawyer, was director of the human rights division in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in El Salvador and executive director of the International Human Rights Law Group. He is a Colombia University law school graduate.</p>
<p>A week ago Annan named Atsu-Koffi Amega of Togo, a supreme court judge, to head the mission and Andrew Chigovera, the deputy attorney general of Zimbabwe, as the second member of the team whose probe has been delayed for months.</p>
<p>Several human rights groups have criticised Annan's actions in naming a new team -- and the United States for strongly supporting it -- as giving in to Kabila and setting a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>Burundi a week ago followed suit and asked that a Brazilian U.N. rights expert be replaced but the United Nations this time stood firm. Rejection of an investigator, approved by the inter-governmental U.N. Human Rights Commission often leads to international isolation.</p>
<p>Annan has strongly defended his position in an effort to get the probe underway. Had he not taken this step, he said, the situation &quot;would have been deadlocked and no investigation would have taken place.&quot;</p>
<p>He said his action was &quot;a unique solution to a unique problem designed to get at the evidence before it disappears.&quot;</p>
<p>The New York-based Human Rights Watch has questioned Chigovera's appointment because his immediate superior is a cabinet minister in a government that was a strong ally of Kabila. But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Chigovera had been vetted by U.N. human rights experts in Geneva &quot;and we stand behind him.&quot;</p>
<p>The refugee crisis in the former Zaire followed the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of up to a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus by militant Hutus.</p>
<p>More than a million Rwandan Hutus crossed into what was then Zaire, fearing reprisals by Tutsis who had taken over the government in Kigali. Their camps in Zaire were controlled by many leaders of the genocide, using civilians as a shield.</p>
<p>Most refugees returned home, but U.N. relief officials say up to 200,000 are missing, including women and children innocent of the genocide.</p>
<p>Kabila's forces, aided by Rwanda, seized power in Kinshasa in May, deposing veteran president Mobutu Sese Seko, an ally of the Hutus in Rwanda. Kabila has denied his troops were responsible for the alleged killings.</p>
