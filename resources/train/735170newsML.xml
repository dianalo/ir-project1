<p>The European Commission's opinion on Estonia, which pointed out some of the weaknesses of the economy, gives a new boost to reforms, central bank vice-president Peter Lohmus told daily Eesti Paevaleht Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good that strong words were used, otherwise we would have become euphoric and lost our self-criticism...,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A tough assessment favours self-criticism and gives a boost to reforms,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The European Commission said in its opinion that the country's GDP per head was only 23 percent of the EU average and that inflation still stood at 23.1 percent in 1996. It was also worried about the country's current account deficit.</p>
<p>Lohmus said he did not believe that economic indicators such as GDP, inflation or trade deficit were priority criteria in EU's enlargement decisions.</p>
<p>But he said that Estonia had been praised for its institutional build-up, the existence and application of legislation and the idea of democracy, he added.</p>
<p>The central bank vice president said the commission did not go into deep economic analysis.</p>
<p>&quot;Different reasons may be behind the trade deficit and it is not explained why it arose,&quot; Lohmus said.</p>
<p>Analysts say the trade deficit, characteristic of transition economies, has been caused by the import of technology and equipment to modernise and build up its industrial sector, forming a base for growth in the export sector.</p>
<p>Lohmus also said that the country's GDP per head was actually 50 to 60 percent of the EU average.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is growing quicker than statistics show,&quot; he said.</p>
