<p>The nation's largest mutual fund company  Fidelity Investments named George Vanderheiden to the six-member board of directors of the firm's parent organization, FMR Corp, the company said Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Morningstar Inc decided to include Vanderheiden, 51, a senior vice president who manages or co-managers more than 10 different equity mutual funds sold through brokers and insurance agents, on its list of all-time top 10 managers.</p>
<p>Fidelity said Vanderheiden manages funds totalling $35.5 billion.  </p>
<p>He had been rumored to be leaving the Fidelity fold after a 26-year career with the company. The mutual fund giant has seen more than 20 portfolio managers jump ship in the past 14 months.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a well deserved appointment for George who has 26 years of experience in the investment business with a 17-year superior record in portfolio management,&quot; said Fidelity watcher David O'Leary.</p>
<p>&quot;It also shows how proactive Fidelity's management is being to assure that key portfolio managers are retained at a time when Fidelity is vulnerable to a loss of investor confidence and competitive inroads,&quot; O'Leary said.  </p>
<p>Vanderheiden will be taking the seat of Caleb Loring, Jr, 76, who for years prior to joining Fidelity in 1966, served as an outside adviser and legal counsel to Fidelity's founder Ed Johnson.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Fidelity, Loring was a partner with the law firm of Gaston snow and Ely Bartlett.</p>
<p>He will continue to serve as a trustee for the Fidelity foundations.</p>
<p>Directors of FMR Corp include J. Gary Burkhead, president Fidelity Management and Research Co; William Byrnes, vice chairman FMR Corp; James C. Curvey, president Fidelity Capital and Abigail Johnson, group leader and manager of equity investment systems.</p>
