<p>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp has kept Poland's debt ratings on hold before parliamentary elections this year, but analysts say a revision of the country's outlook to positive from stable hints that an upgrade could be in the works.</p>
<p>The U.S. agency announced in New York on Tuesday that it had affirmed Poland's triple-'B'-minus long-term foreign currency rating and its single-'A'-minus long-term local currency rating. But it changed the outlook on ratings to positive from stable.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is for Poland to move to a single 'A' rating, possibly after parliamentary polls or in 1998, rather than this year,&quot; said David Mars, director of emerging Europe and Africa economic research at SBC Warburg in London.</p>
<p>Analysts said that despite expectations of an upgrade this time, they were not disappointed by the steady ratings and did not expect investors to change their views on Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;The rating reaffirms what has already been known and certainly will not change investor outlook. It is understandabble that ratings would not change ahead of general elections,&quot; said Daniel Schultz, analyst at Societe Generale in London.</p>
<p>The polls, due in September, are likely to pit the ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) against the opposition Solidarity Election Action (AWS) alliance of parties grouped around the largest Polish trade union.</p>
<p>&quot;Assuming that a stable government of some form takes power after the elections and that the current account deficit is not proven to be a real danger, the next move will obviously be an upgrade,&quot; SBC Warburg's Mars said.</p>
<p>Poland also has a BBB rating from IBCA and Baa3 from Moody's. This year's budget law allows Poland to issue $500 million worth of bonds abroad and the finance ministry is expected to issue a Yankee bond in late June or early July.</p>
<p>Analysts said that although the current account deficit soared to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 1997 from $1.3 billion in all of 1996, imports remained largely for investment rather than of consumer goods.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer good imports constitute only a small part of Polish imports. They are a natural phenomenon for an emerging economy and keep a lid on inflation,&quot; said Tadeusz Chroscicki, head analyst at the government's Centre for Strategic Studies.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's also affirmed the 'A-1' short-term local currency rating and assigned the 'A-3' short-term foreign currency rating.</p>
<p>Factors behind its decision included prospects for inflation to sink to about 13-14 percent by the end of 1997 from 15.3 in April and to single digits in 1998.</p>
<p>Analysts said that although the Polish currency was temporarily weakened by a recent crisis in the Czech Republic, this should not weigh on the assessment of the Polish economy because of its stronger fundamentals.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Czech Republic, whose sovereign debt has an 'A' investment-grade rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, may even be overrated in comparison with Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Czech-Polish comparison, one country is rated too high in comparison to the other and I think it's the Czechs,&quot; SBC Warburg's Mars said.</p>
<p>But he doubted the Czech ratings would be cut in the near future despite a sharp fall in economic growth and a surge in the current account deficit which provoked a speculative attack on the Czech crown.</p>
<p>Late on Tuesday Wieslaw Szczuka, director of the foreign department in the Polish finance ministry, said the rating showed that the country was heading toward investment grade. But he declined to forecast when that could happen.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased with this modification and consider that every positive change is good, even if it takes place in small steps,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;(It) means that we are perceived rather better than a year ago and we have a chance of an improvement of the rating in future.&quot;</p>
