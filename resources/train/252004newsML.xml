<text>
<p>Banco de Mexico on Wednesday unveiled the outline of its monetary program for 1997, aimed at bringing inflation down to 15 percent and economic growth above four percent.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, the central bank fell short of revealing the exact expected movement of the monetary base next year, and the quarterly limits on the change in net domestic credit. It said it preferred to wait until January to know the balance of the monetary base at year-end.  </p>
<p>But it said the trajectory of the monetary base would be one of the most important reference points for conducting monetary policy.</p>
<p>During the next year, it said, an anticipated drop in inflation and interest rates would spur the monetary base, cutting the opportunity costs of holding bills and coins.</p>
<p>The rise in the base would be greater than that derived from the rise in prices and real GDP, leading to some remonetization.  </p>
<p>&quot;Preliminarily, the Banco de Mexico estimates an approximate 24.5 percent increase in the monetary base during 1997, versus 1996. The expected growth in the base is above the result of combining expected real GDP growth (4.5 percent) and inflation (15 percent), because of a remonetization whose amount is estimated at 3.6 percent of the amount of the base at the close of 1996,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It said it aimed to raise net international assets by $1.9 billion next year, via exchange transactions with the public sector and the exercise of dollar put options auctioned to banks.  </p>
<p>The central bank also said it would put limits, rather than targets, on the quarterly growth of net domestic credit, which is the difference between the growth of the monetary base and net international assets.</p>
<p>It said lower net domestic credit would not imply efforts to check economic growth, because the reduction of pesos would be compensated by the injection of cash derived from central bank dollar purchases to build assets.  </p>
<p>In defining its criteria for the execution of monetary policy, Banco de Mexico said it would adjust primary money supply on a daily basis to make this tally with the expected demand for the monetary base.</p>
<p>It said it would not operate in the money market to generate positive accumulated cash balances with banks.</p>
<p>It would tailor the evolution of the monetary base to keep it consistent with a 15 percent inflation rate.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the bank will act to maintain order in the exchange and money markets. For that reason the central bank could change the conditions of supplying internal credit, leaving the banking system &quot;short&quot;,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said that meant a small part of its total credit to the system could be granted at a penalty rate of twice the return of 28-day Cetes.</p>
<p>&quot;Once those conditions causing an adjustment in monetary policy dissipate, Banco de Mexico would return to a neutral position,&quot; it said.</p>
