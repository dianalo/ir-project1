<p>At least three people were killed and seven injured in the Kashmiri summer capital Srinagar on Sunday when paramilitary troops fired at suspected guerrillas who threw a grenade at them, police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>Police officials said the exchange of fire occurred in the crowded Batmaloo suburb of Srinagar.</p>
<p>Suspected separatist guerrillas lobbed a grenade at a paramilitary patrol and then opened fire, police said.</p>
<p>The troopers returned the fire. Two of their colleagues were injured when the grenade exploded, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Police said three passersby were killed in the melee.</p>
<p>The injured have been taken to nearby hospitals for treatment, the police said.</p>
<p>More than a dozen separatist groups are fighting for independence or merger with Pakistan in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, India's only Moslem-majority region.</p>
<p>Police and hospital sources say more than 20,000 people have been killed since the separatist revolt began seven years ago.</p>
