<p>Diabetic mothers have up to a 10-fold risk of having a baby with birth defects and five times the risk of a stillbirth, British doctors reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Although the risks of diabetes in pregnancy are well-known to doctors, the word is evidently not getting out to women with diabetes, Vyvyan Howard, an expert in foetal development at the University of Liverpool, said.</p>
<p>His team studied 462 pregnancies in 355 women with type-one or insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) over five years.</p>
<p>Reporting in the British Medical Journal, they said the diabetic women had 10 times the risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and a five-fold risk of stillbirth, as compared to the general population.</p>
<p>Howard said all the mothers in the study knew they had diabetes but many did not act soon enough to make sure their conditions were stabilised.</p>
<p>&quot;Diabetic mothers should take it very seriously and make sure they are in the optimal state before they try to become pregnant,&quot; Howard said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We know what to do but it's a matter of raising awareness amongst mothers and potential mothers,&quot; he added. &quot;We must try harder.&quot;</p>
<p>Howard said scientists still did not fully understand why diabetes caused birth defects.</p>
<p>&quot;It has everything to do with how much energy the embryo is getting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Although diabetes is common -- IDDM affects more than 13 million people around the world -- the causes are complex.</p>
<p>It causes imbalances in the way fats and sugars are handled by the body. This is crucial in pregnancy.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously the way that insulin is available and is used has everything to do with the food supply to the foetus,&quot; Howard said. &quot;You have to have insulin to get the glucose across to the cell.&quot;</p>
<p>If diabetic mothers do not have their blood sugar levels under control, the babies, at a crucial stage of development, suffer.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people, by the time they go to see their doctor, they are three months down the line,&quot; Howard said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is probably the most critical period -- the time of conception and the first three months of pregnancy.&quot;</p>
<p>In a second study published in the journal, Gillian Hawthorne of Hartlepool General Hospital and colleagues also found most diabetic women had their condition poorly controlled at conception.</p>
<p>They found newborn babies of women with IDDM had a mortality rate 15 times higher than normal and four times the rate of birth defects.</p>
<p>&quot;Diabetic pregnancy remains a high-risk state,&quot; they concluded.</p>
