<p>Finnish monetary policy should become tighter as inflation will accelerate, and the best way to tighten monetary policy would be to let the markka appreciate, brokerage Davy Protos said in a report received on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong Finnish growth outlook is inconsistent with the current combination of low nominal interest rates and an undervalued currency,&quot; Protos said.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of monetary policy will lead to higher inflation,&quot; it said, adding: &quot;It is ... obvious that there is a clear need to tighten monetary policy. The best way to do this would be by an appreciation of the markka.&quot;  </p>
<p>Protos painted two scenarios; in the first, the markka would be kept in a narrow band near its ERM midpoint -- this would lead to demand inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;We calculate that inflation would rise to 2.8 percent,&quot; Protos said, referring to the year-on-year rise in December, &quot;and spike to 4.0 percent at the end of 1998,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, Protos expected the Bank of Finland to let the markka &quot;move closer to its long run equilibrium level.&quot; The markka would appreciate 5-10 percent before the end of 1997. Inflation would accelerate to 2.0 percent by the end of this year and to 2.5 percent in 1998, it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Finland underlying inflation indicator would rise by only two percent,&quot; Protos said, noting that the central bank's need to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates would be &quot;markedly lower with a stronger currency.&quot;</p>
