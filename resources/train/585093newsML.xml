<title>SWITZERLAND: Switzerland's Swiss Bank Corp. to buy Dillon Read.</title>
<headline>Switzerland's Swiss Bank Corp. to buy Dillon Read.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-05-15</dateline>

<p>Swiss Bank Corp. said Thursday it agreed to buy U.S. investment bank Dillon Read &amp; Co. for about $600 million.</p>
<p>Speculation of an SBC deal grew after news Wednesday that the Dutch financial services group ING Groep NV, which owns 25 percent of Dillion Read, had broken off talks to buy the remaining 75 percent from the firm's partners.  </p>
<p>The Swiss banking giant said that upon completion of the deal, which is subject to approval by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other regulators, Dillon Read would be merged with SBC Warburg, SBC's investment banking and capital markets division. The combined entity would be known as SBC Warburg Dillon Read. SBC acquired S.G. Warburg in mid-1995.</p>
<p>SBC Chief Executive Marcel Ospel said last month that the company had no plans for a major investment banking acquisition in North America. He also dismissed the idea of buying a second-tier U.S. investment bank, but said the bank would consider acquiring a franchise or expertise through the purchase of a small boutique.</p>
<p>Dillon Read is not a major player and its acquisition is not expected to immediately push SBC to the top of the heap in the U.S. investment banking community. But Dillon has a good reputation, a good client book and capable management, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The key relationships (with Dillion management and their corporate finance contacts) will make or break the deal,&quot; Salomon Brothers banking analyst John Leonard said prior to SBC's announcement.</p>
