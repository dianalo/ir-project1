<title>UK: Britain's House of Lords backs EU withdrawal bill.</title>
<headline>Britain's House of Lords backs EU withdrawal bill.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>The anti-Brussels wing of Britain's ruling Conservative Party scored a minor triumph on Friday when the upper House of Lords backed a bill which would effectively mean Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.</p>
<p>The bill, proposed by Conservative Lord John Pearson, has no chance of becoming law despite approval after an initial debate by 52 votes to 51 in the unelected house -- and apparent backing from former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>It would repeal legislation passed when Britain joined the EU in 1972 under which EU law was made superior to British legislation.</p>
<p>Thatcher sat through the first half of a 6-1/2 hour debate on the bill, occasionally nodding at points made by its supporters, but left before the vote.</p>
<p>But former cabinet minister Lord Norman Tebbit, one of her most loyal political supporters, spoke for the bill.</p>
<p>He said it could provide a means by which Britons who opposed the further ceding of sovereignty to Brussels could confront advocates in other EU states of a federal Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bill before us, if enacted, would create the crisis in Europe which is needed for the discussions to begin to make a serious effort to solve these problems,&quot; Tebbit said.</p>
<p>Government minister Lord Richard Inglewood said the bill would leave Britain in breach of its obligations under EU treaties. &quot;In such circumstances we would not have any choice but to withdraw,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This Bill is quite simply against Government policy and Britain's interests,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The bill would have to go through further stages in the Lords and then be passed by the lower House of Commons before it could become law -- something that is inconceivable with an election expected within the next three months.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major has been battling for years to control the so-called Eurosceptic wing of his party, refusing their attempts to make him rule out British participation in new EU developments such as the planned single currency.</p>
<p>But earlier this week, party chairman Brian Mawhinney effectively gave permission to more than 100 Conservative candidates in the forthcoming election to declare their opposition to a single currency in their personal manifestos.</p>
