<headline>U.S. Air Force cites crew error in C-130 crash.</headline>

<p>The Air Force on Monday blamed crew error in the August crash in Wyoming of a C-130 military cargo plane that accompanied President Bill Clinton on vacation. All eight crew members and one passenger died in the crash.</p>
<p>&quot;The accident investigation board report concludes that crew error caused the crash,&quot; the Air Force said in a statement on the incident, in which the four-engine plane slammed into a mountain near Jackson Hole on Aug. 17.  </p>
<p>&quot;The crew failed to monitor the aircraft's position and flight path relative to high terrain surrounding the Jackson Hole Airport,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The C-130 was on a presidential support mission and had taken off from Jackson Hole headed for John F. Kennedy Airport in New York when it hit a mountain in the Bridger-Teton National Forest about 9 miles 15 km east of Jackson Hole. Clinton had left Jackson Hole by helicopter, where he vacationed the previous week, several hours before the crash.</p>
<p>The plane was carrying a secret service agent, presidential vehicles and other equipment and the 15-page report said several mistakes were made, including failure of the pilot to review quick climb requirements in such a mountainous area.</p>
<p>Investigators noted that although no clouds were reported below 12,000 feet (3,660 metres) when the crash occurred at about 10:30 p.m. local time, &quot;numerous witnesses state that it was a dark night and the mountain tops were not visible.&quot;</p>
