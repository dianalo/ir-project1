<title>VIETNAM: Vietnam, China railway passenger service delayed.</title>

<p>Vietnamese rail officials said on Monday that plans to resume a cross-border passenger service on a meandering colonial line between Hanoi and China's southwest city of Kunming had run into delays.</p>
<p>The train service, reopened for freight a year ago, was expected to begin moving passengers in December. But plans have run into what were described as technical problems on the Chinese side.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been delayed by a few months. There is no timetable yet for when any service might begin,&quot; said a state executive with Vietnam Railway in Hanoi.</p>
<p>An official who declined to be identified said the two countries had reached ministerial-level agreement that the plan should go ahead, but China now appeared to be dragging its feet.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The two socialist neighbours restored rail links at two points on their mutual border in February last year, 17 years after they were severed by a bloody border war.</p>
<p>While the move was seen as symbolically important the lines have failed so far to prove a commercial success.</p>
<p>The Hanoi-Kunming rail freight-link has yet to become the significant conduit for trade, while passenger traffic on a Hanoi-Beijing route via Lang Son in Vietnam and China's Nanning is running at a substantial loss.</p>
