<p>The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers will discuss outstanding issues between their rival countries on the fringes of a South Asian summit in the Maldives next month, a Pakistani spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif would attend the May 12-14 summit of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in the Maldives capital Male.</p>
<p>Sharif will meet the Indian prime minister and &quot;hopefully they will discuss all outstanding issues between the two countries&quot;, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said the two prime ministers were also expected to agree on guidelines for more planned talks between the two countries' top foreign ministry officials, who resumed peace talks in New Delhi last week after a three-year hiatus.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers Inder Kumar Gujral of India and Gohar Ayub Khan of Pakistan decided at their maiden meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday that the foreign ministry secretaries meet again in Islamabad before the Male summit, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>But he said no date had been set for the meeting of the secretaries, who were still working out the agenda for future talks.</p>
<p>He said Gujral and Khan, who met after attending a Non-Aligned Movement ministerial meeting in New Delhi on April 7-8, discussed outstanding issues, including their dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.</p>
<p>&quot;I can confirm that the Kashmir issue was discussed,&quot; he said about the issue Pakistan regards as central to relations between the two countries, which have fought three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
<p>Two of the wars were fought over Kashmir, two-thirds of which is ruled by India and the remainder by Pakistan.</p>
<p>The two recent rounds of talks between high-level foreign ministry officials have set a deliberate, step-by-step pace to the sensitive negotiations.</p>
<p>The Pakistani spokesman said: &quot;There is no plan at all to freeze the Jammu and Kashmir issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Khan said on return from Delhi on Wednesday that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had invited him and his Indian counterpart to a dinner meeting in New York during the next General Assembly session later this year.</p>
<p>Both sides had welcomed Annan's initiative, the Pakistani spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the meeting can take place but there is nothing definite about it at this moment,&quot; he said.</p>
