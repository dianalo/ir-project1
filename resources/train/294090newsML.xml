<p>A battle over aviation policy has exposed a gaping split in India's coalition government between free traders and defenders of domestic industry.</p>
<p>Civil Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim said late on Monday that the centre-left government was drafting a new policy that would bar foreign investment in domestic airlines.</p>
<p>Hours later, newspapers revealed that a panel of senior government officials headed by the Industry Ministry had approved a proposed investment by Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) in a joint airlines venture with India's Tata Industries.</p>
<p>Analysts said the divergent tacks reflect simmering contradictions and disarray within Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's disparate 13-party coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows a lack of coordination in the cabinet,&quot; said Vinod Mehta, editor of the weekly news magazine Outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a chaotic government because Deve Gowda has never worked in the Centre (federal government) and doesn't know how to suppress disruptions,&quot; said Ashok Desai, a newspaper columnist and former senior finance ministry official.</p>
<p>It was not the first time Ibrahim had squared off with the Industry Ministry.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), an advisory panel comprised of senior officials and headed by Industry Secretary N. Mohanty, cleared a proposal by Britain's Pearson Plc, publisher of the Financial Times, to take an equity stake in an Indian newspaper company.</p>
<p>Ibrahim, who is also information and broadcasting minister, mounted a campaign against the link-up, which was later rejected by the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment.</p>
<p>The high-profile Ibrahim has used the same boundless energy to fight against foreign investment in the airlines sector.</p>
<p>In an ironic twist, he has won political backing from the government's left-wing allies and the right-wing opposition.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of India-Marxist and the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) both denounced the FIPB's move to clear the proposed $600 million SIA-Tata linkup and to send it to the cabinet for a final decision.</p>
<p>Ibrahim, who comes from Deve Gowda's home state of Karnataka, says India's state-owned carriers -- Indian Airlines on domestic routes and Air-India internationally -- need to be strengthened before they face foreign competition.</p>
<p>He said on Monday that his ministry was drafting a new aviation policy that would block the SIA-Tata joint venture and, significantly, require the two foreign partners in India's Jet Airways -- Gulf Air and Kuwait Airways -- to sell their stakes.</p>
<p>However, he said foreign investment would be welcome in aviation infrastructure such as airports.</p>
<p>Currently the government reviews foreign firms' proposals on a case-by-case basis. If approved, a foreign firm can take up to a 40 percent stake in a domestic airline.</p>
<p>Ibrahim is at odds with the more liberal members of Deve Gowda's cabinet including Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and Industry Minister Murasoli Maran.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a war going on,&quot; Desai said.</p>
<p>Ibrahim's more protectionist approach has periodically sent shivers down the spines of foreign investors, who fear the government will backtrack on free trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The battle between the Industry Ministry and the Civil Aviation Ministry is likely to snowball into a major crisis on the foreign investment front,&quot; The Economic Times said.</p>
<p>Outlook editor Mehta predicted the SIA-Tata tie-up would eventually be approved and Ibrahim would have to back down after scoring political points by sticking up for domestic industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Deve Gowda is a free trader,&quot; Mehta said. &quot;The government wants to show there has been an enormous debate. But after four or five months, I think it (the tie-up) will be allowed, after announcing measures to strengthen Indian Airlines.&quot;</p>
