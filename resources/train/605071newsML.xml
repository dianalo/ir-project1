<p>A former soldier armed with two guns and a grenade ran amok and killed at least 17 people on Thursday in a small town in northeastern Brazil before dying in a shootout with police, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Genildo Ferreira started his shooting spree on Wednesday night, killing a taxi driver he suspected of having an affair with his wife, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He then roamed the streets of Sao Goncalo do Amarante in Rio Grande do Norte state until midday on Thursday armed with a hit list and shot to death at least another 16 people, including his wife and mother-in-law, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ferreira heard his wife was having an affair and that people were saying he was homosexual. That's when he went crazy and just started shooting,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;He was armed with two handguns and a grenade.&quot;</p>
<p>Ferreira left a letter listing 25 people he wanted to kill and gave some indication as to his motives.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a premeditated crime,&quot; the mayor of the town of 65,000 inhabitants, Francisco Potiguar Cavalcanti Junior, told Reuters. &quot;We consider this an isolated case. Our town is a town of peace. The mood here is of sadness and consternation.&quot; The town is 1,553 miles (2,500 km) northeast of the capital Brasilia.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old left the military five years ago and was working at a local tile factory.</p>
<p>Two other people were injured in the shooting spree, and police were looking for eight people who were missing and were suspected of having been shot.</p>
<p>A former friend and colleague of Ferreira's, who identified himself only as Genival, told Reuters that ever since his son's death a year ago Ferreira had threatened to kill 25 people.</p>
<p>&quot;He used to be a calm kind of guy, but ever since his son was run over by a car he became a bit strange,&quot; said Genival.</p>
<p>Ferreira, who was finally cornered by 200 police officers in a ceramic tile factory where he was hiding out with two hostages, a woman and her young daugher, died in a gun fight with police, the police spokesman said. The two hostages were freed unharmed.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether Ferreira committed suicide or whether police shot him. One of the hostages said Genival had shot himself first before police riddled his body with bullets.</p>
<p>Genival said that three months earlier Ferreira had gone to buy a coffin, telling the undertaker he was going to commit suicide.</p>
