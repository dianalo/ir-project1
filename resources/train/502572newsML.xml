<p>SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures pared gains late on Friday after the yen retreated from initial highs, dealers said.</p>
<p>A slew of pro-yen comments from Japanese and U.S. officials helped Euroyen futures breach important resistance levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Supportive comments from government officials led the yen higher,&quot; a U.S. commission house dealer said. But the early speculative sales of dollars cooled, resulting in a pullback in the yen, which spilled into euroyen and JGB's.</p>
<p>December Euroyen stood at 99.05 at 1120 GMT against its IMM close of 99.05, but off intraday highs of 99.08.  </p>
<p>June JGBs settled at 126.66 against their open at 127.00, on a low volume of 207.</p>
<p>Dealers said conflicting comments by key finance officials, and concern central banks may intervene in the market, acted to keep the market nervous and mostly sidelined.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rate markets and currency futures are very nervous at this time. It's the speed at which the dollar is rising,&quot; a European commission house dealer said.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures drifted sideways in lacklustre conditions awaiting U.S. inflation data on Friday, which could sway the current outlook for higher interest rates.  </p>
<p>U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) and retail sales data for March will both be released on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts expect little surprise from the PPI figures but a poll in the U.S. by Reuters forecast retail sales to have risen 0.6 percent in March and 0.4 percent, excluding car sales.</p>
<p>Dealers said strong economic growth pointed to a further hike in interest rates by 25 basis points at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on May 20.</p>
<p>September Eurodollars ended at 93.730 against their IMM close at 93.73 on moderate volume of 7300 lots.</p>
