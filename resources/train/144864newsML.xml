<p>Shares in British Airways Plc dropped in early trade on Friday after USAir Group Inc said it would cancel a key marketing alliance between the two airlines, pushing their three-year partnership near collapse.</p>
<p>The stock was down 17-1/2p at 561-1/2 by 0713 GMT.</p>
<p>BA said late yesterday it was disappointed at the USAir decision but it remained convinced that an alliance was in the interests of both airlines.  </p>
<p>Analysts called the USAir decision disappointing but noted it could smoothe the way to BA's proposed alliance with American Airlines and benefit the British airline long term.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the danger is that if the American deal does not go ahead, the relationship with USAir has deteriorated so far, and BA would then have lost both,&quot; said James Halstead, airline analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing.</p>
<p>Another analyst, who asked not to be named, said BA still expected to reap the benefits of joint purchasing and did not expect to lose all the traffic between the two companies' services.  </p>
<p>&quot;Also, there is still the prospect of further payment of arrears of dividends from USAir stock, although, of course, this decision as a whole is not positive news,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>He and others were sceptical the decision would prompt major downgrades on BA stock. They played down the share's fall on Friday morning, noting that it had had a strong run.</p>
