<text>
<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures remained narrowly mixed late Friday in sluggish trade, with a steady to firmer physical market underpinning the complex although prices stayed stuck in recent technical ranges.</p>
<p>At 1410 EDT, July was 1.2 cents lower at $2.165 per million British thermal units, while August was down 0.3 cent at $2.18. Other months remained on either side of unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;Injections (storage buying) may put a floor under the market, but the weather is still bearish and I don't see it taking off to the upside,&quot; said a New York trader, noting 6-10 day forecasts were still calling for mostly seasonal temps.  </p>
<p>Some revised forecasts now call for normal Midwest and Northeast weather through next week, with the Southwest and southern California the only areas expected above-normal.</p>
<p>Traders said steady injection demand, particularly with spreads now more attractive, has helped underpin both physical and paper prices, but few expected a significant rally without a broader heat wave to stir some air conditioning demand.</p>
<p>Traders said there was little or no effect from a small, natural gas line leak in the Vermilion Bay area offshore Louisiana. Several lines were shut last night for testing, but major pipeline operators said Friday flows were normal.</p>
<p>Technical traders agreed recent ranges were intact, with resistance in July still at $2.25, and then at $2.37 and the contract high of $2.44. Support was seen at $2.10, with straonger buying expected at $2.08.</p>
<p>In the weekend cash, Gulf Coast prices firmed slightly Friday to the mid-teens. Midcon pipes were two to three cents higher at about $2.05. New York city gate gas prices were up slightly to about $2.40.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 14,145 contracts traded by 1340 EDT. Hub open interest on June 5 fell 1,375 lots to 195,368.</p>
<p>On KCBT, July slipped 1.5 cents to $2.035, while deferreds were mixed. The East/West spread widened by 0.3 cents to 13.0 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
