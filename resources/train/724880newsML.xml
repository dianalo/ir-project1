<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition and Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) bickered at the weekend over government tax reforms, plans to help prepare the economy for the euro which increasingly seem doomed to failure.</p>
<p>Kohl's ruling coalition wants talks to continue with the SPD over plans to slash taxes, but accused the party of blocking reforms which Germany's weak economy desperately needs.</p>
<p>The legislation, aimed at cutting some 30 billion marks ($17 billion) in income taxes over the next two years, was passed in the lower house, or Bundestag, last month, but was then blocked by the opposition-controlled upper house, or Bundesrat.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the SPD Bundesrat majority plays this game, it makes no sense to launch initiatives, which we know (SPD leader Oskar) Lafontaine can block with his scorched earth policies,&quot; Kohl's top deputy Wolfgang Schaueble told German radio.</p>
<p>Parliament's mediation committee, trying to hammer out a compromise on the plans, failed to reach agreement last week. The committee, made up of 32 members divided equally between both houses of parliament, agreed to meet again on July 30.</p>
<p>But prospects for compromise looked slim, with Henning Voscherau, Hamburg mayor and SPD negotiator in the tax talks, saying Germany would not achieve a proper reform of its tax system for at least another four years.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is realistic that a just and sensible tax reform will only become law under an SPD-led government,&quot; Voscherau told Spiegel news magazine in an interview released ahead of publication on Monday.</p>
<p>Voscherau said he expected Kohl to lose next year's general election and said a new SPD government would then need until 2001 to pass the necessary legislation for tax reform.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel, struggling to get the economy in shape for European economic and monetary union, managed on Friday to get the cabinet to agree to his supplementary budget for 1997 and draft 1998 budget after weeks of horse trading.</p>
<p>He had hoped the tax reform would kick-start investment in Germany's unemployment-plagued economy with income tax cuts and offset lost revenue by plugging loopholes and tax write-offs.</p>
<p>But the SPD says his plans would rip open a 45 billion mark financing gap in federal, state and local budgets, provide little relief for low-wage earners and would not boost investment because they do not lower wage costs.</p>
<p>Chancellery minister Friedrich Bohl said he still held out hope that the legislation could be approved by the beginning of September and said Kohl's coalition was ready for talks with the SPD at any time over the summer break to reach a deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The SPD will damage our country if it continues its party strategy at the expense of the greater good,&quot; Bohl said in a statement.</p>
<p>But with prospects for a broad agreement waning, opposition and coalition parties have begun talking of reaching agreement where possible, so as not to scuttle the whole project.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to compromise immediately in four areas: the abolition of trading capital tax for companies, reducing supplementary wage costs, simplifying tax laws and reducing stupid tax privileges,&quot; Voscherau said.</p>
<p>It will be difficult, however, for Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) to agree to a partial reform because junior coalition partners the Free Democrats (FDP) have staked their future on tax cuts -- particularly to the so-called solidarity surcharge levied to support the former communist east.</p>
<p>Economics Minister and leading FDP member Guenther Rexrodt was quoted at the weekend by Focus magazine as saying the coalition would be endangered unless the surcharge was cut to 5.5 percent from 7.5 percent next year -- a decrease included in the reform bill.</p>
<p>Otto Lambsdorff, a former economics minister and honorary FDP chairman, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper that his party wanted the government to propose an extra bill to cut the solidarity tax if the SPD continued to block the whole tax package, an idea which several CDU deputies rejected outright. $ = 1.78 German Marks)</p>
