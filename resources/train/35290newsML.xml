<title>FRANCE: French court to rule on Papon war crimes trial.</title>
<headline>French court to rule on Papon war crimes trial.</headline>

<p>A court will rule on September 18 whether an ex-minister should stand trial for crimes against humanity for deporting thousands of Jews from wartime France, justice sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Maurice Papon, budget minister in the 1970s before his wartime actions were known, is accused of deporting 1,690 Jews, including 223 children, in 1942-44 when he was secretary-general of the Bordeaux area administration. Most were later gassed at the Nazi Auschwitz death camp.</p>
<p>The decision will be handed down by an appeals court which held hearings in the southwestern city of Bordeaux in March on whether Papon, now 85, should face trial.</p>
<p>Papon's lawyer told reporters after the four-day March hearing he was convinced the court would decide in favour of his client and rule out a trial.</p>
<p>He said Papon had never followed Nazi ideology and had only obeyed orders imposed by the occupying power.</p>
<p>Whatever decision is handed down is likely to be appealed by the losing side, again delaying any conclusion to legal action initiated in 1981, legal sources said.</p>
