<headline>US Court rules against CFTC on forex options trade.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>A unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Congress has not authorized the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate &quot;off-exchange&quot; trading in options to buy or sell foreign currency.</p>
<p>At issue in the ruling was the so-called &quot;Treasury Amendment&quot; adopted by Congress in 1974 to the Commodity Exchange Act. The section says the CFTC does not have jurisdiction over foreign currency transactions &quot;unless they involve sales for future delivery on a board of trade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury Amendment exempts from CFTC regulation off- exchange trading in foreign currency options,&quot; Justice John Paul Stevens declared in the high court's ruling.  </p>
<p>The case began when CFTC had filed suit in New York, charging William Dunn, Delta Consultants, a New Jersey firm he headed, and two other companies he was associated with, with fraud in connection with commodity option transactions.</p>
<p>The alleged scheme involved call and put options on various foreign currencies that were traded among dealers and brokers, not on any organized exchange.</p>
<p>A federal judge in 1994 granted the CFTC's request for the appointment of a temporary receiver to locate and take control of the defendants' funds.</p>
<p>The CFTC cited the apparent disappearance of more than $180 million in customer funds and the transfer by the defendants from the United States to Switzerland of at least $19.5 million just before the alleged scheme was discovered.</p>
<p>A U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a challenge by Dunn and Delta Consultants claiming the CFTC lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court's decision.  </p>
<p>Stevens said it was plain that foreign currency options are &quot;transactions in foreign currency&quot; within the meaning of the law.</p>
<p>He said the Supreme Court was not persuaded by any of the arguments advanced by the CFTC in support of a narrower reading of the law that would exempt from its regulation certain futures contracts without exempting options.</p>
<p>The CFTC and the U.S. Treasury Department have adopted differing views about the scope of the law.</p>
<p>Supporting the appeal by Dunn and Delta Consultants were a number of industry trade groups, including the Futures Industry Association, the Managed Futures Association and the Public Securities Association.  </p>
<p>They said the appeals court's decision &quot;creates significant uncertainty over the enforceability of the United States's half of the $40 billion in foreign currency options transactions traded daily.&quot; They also said the ruling imposes &quot;tremendous regulatory and transactional costs&quot; on the over-the-counter foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p>On the other side, Chicago futures exchanges said they could be put out of business by unregulated competitors if the high court throws out the CFTC's case against Dunn.</p>
<p>Stevens concluded that arguments by each side on whether off-exchange foreign currency options should be exempt from CFTC regulation represented &quot;an important public policy&quot; question best addressed by Congress, not the courts.</p>
<p>Several members of Congress have said they may push for the adoption of legislation to change the 1974 amendment.</p>
