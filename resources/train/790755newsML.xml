<p>Foreign exchange profits at British banks jumped in the first half of 1997 as volatility gripped currency markets, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot revolved around the market-driven volatility... It was a good half-year based on customer business,&quot; said Ian Poulter, banking analyst at Williams de Broe.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange profits at some banks, for instance, soared by as much as 35 percent in the first six months of 1997 after a set of dreary results in 1996.</p>
<p>Blazing the trail was Standard Chartered Plc, a London-based bank with big Asia-Pacific region franchise.</p>
<p>StanChart's foreign exchange dealings profits jumped to 108 million sterling ($171 million) in the first six months of the year from 80 million pounds in the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>The bank reported big profits from foreign exchange trading in the Far East where currency turmoil has been rife in recent months.</p>
<p>The Thai baht was hit by a de-facto devaluation in May, which triggered a bout of currency volatility in the region that hit the Philippine peso and Malaysian ringgit, to name but two, in its wake.</p>
<p>Close on the heels of StanChart, NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank Plc, and HSBC Holdings Plc both posted healthy growth in foreign exchange profit.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange dealing profits at NatWest, for instance, rose by 23 million pounds -- or 28 percent -- to 104 million due mainly to increased revenue from options trading and forward foreign exchange, NatWest said in a statement accompanying its six-month results.</p>
<p>At HSBC Holdings, one of the world's biggest banking groups, foreign exchange profits jumped by 53 million to 243 million pounds in the first half of 1997 from 190 million in 1996, figures accompanying full-company results showed last week.</p>
<p>The bank said its foreign exchange results improved in the first half of 1997 as exchange-rate volatility increased.</p>
<p>&quot;Exchange-rate volatility was higher in the first half of the year and we have seen quite a lot more of customer business,&quot; Guy Heald, treasurer at HSBC Midland, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say (FX) volumes are up quite dramatically in the first half of the year... There was a lot of activity, as you can imagine, in sterling,&quot; Heald said in a telephone interview following the release of first-half results.</p>
<p>Sterling has ballooned in 1997, pushing in late July to a high of 3.0878 marks -- the highest since August 1989 -- on the back of a buoyant UK economy and hefty interest rates, which with base rates of 7.00 percent are among the highest in Europe.</p>
<p>Perceptions that European economic and monetary union could result in a weak single currency when it is launched have also helped sterling. Since early August, however, it has been on the retreat on perceptions that UK rates have peaked.</p>
<p>Currency markets, with daily turnover in excess of a trillion dollars, have been extremely active in 1997. The U.S. dollar, involved in more than four-fifths of all currency trades, has been motoring higher for most of the year. Last week, for instance, dollar/mark rallied to more than eight-year highs of 1.8913 marks.</p>
<p>Dealing profits at BZW, Barclays Plc's investment arm, were also buoyant, rising to 228 million pounds in the first six months of 1997 from 169 million a year ago, figures released last week showed.</p>
<p>&quot;This reflects a strong performance in foreign exchange, due largely to the refocusing of the business, together with good results from the sterling fixed-income and money market businesses and favourable trading conditions in base metals in the early part of the year,&quot; Barclays said in a statement.</p>
<p>But sustainability of forex profits is not assured, said de Broe's Poulter, as future exchange rates remain hard to predict.</p>
<p>&quot;It remains to be seen if you get the same volatility over the next six months,&quot; he said.</p>
