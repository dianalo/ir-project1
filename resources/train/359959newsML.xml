<p>Ukraine has taken steps to change rules on foreign buying of Treasury bills, possibly introducing limits on purchases of short-term maturities, the deputy finance minister said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Finance has put forward new rules concerning non-resident participation on Ukraine's securities market, and has passed then on for registration to the Justice Ministry,&quot; Andriy Lytvyn told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The document will become effective 10 days after it is published (in newspapers),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lytvyn would not say what was in the document and it was not immediately clear on how quickly the new rules would be enforced.</p>
<p>But a top central bank official said last week the finance ministry wanted to increase Ukrainian investment after it estimated foreigners were responsible for up to 80 percent of market activity.</p>
<p>Lytvyn said the document &quot;governs the operation of non-residents with T-bills, and brings in elements of accounting and control.&quot;</p>
<p>He hinted the ministry of finance wanted to attract foreigners more into long-term paper. They can currently buy as much paper as they want through Ukrainian banks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are interested in (non-residents) loaning us money for longer periods, and we are preparing proposals and resolutions to release longer-term paper,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One option would be to restrict foreign investment in short-term paper.</p>
<p>The ministry issues three-, six-, nine and 12-month discount paper auctioned on its behalf by the central bank usually twice weekly. Yields at the last auction varied from 32.47 percent on three-month paper to 43.78 percent on 12-month bills.</p>
<p>The authorities are now considering issuing longer-term interest-bearing bonds.</p>
<p>Western bankers and economists have said Ukraine cannot afford to throw foreigners out if it hopes to cover the 1997 deficit which will be revealed when the budget is passed -- probably in March.</p>
<p>Lytvyn said registering the new rules with the justice ministry would take several days. A new law must first be published in the press before it is considered effective.</p>
<p>Central bank chief Viktor Yushchenko told Reuters last week that limiting banks available to non-residents and capping yields on non-resident buying were also being considered.</p>
<p>Dealers said the biggest buyers were CS First Boston, Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais. Banks in Cyprus and the Baltic States, probably handling Russian money, are also big investors, they said.</p>
