<p>------------------------ Jan 21 -------------------------</p>
<p>* Turnover dwindles to 5.665 billion pesos</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Philippine interbank call loan rate remained rooted at 10.53125 percent as demand for overnight money eased, traders said.</p>
<p>Turnover in the market dwindled to 5.665 billion pesos from Monday's 9.112 billion pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no borrowers, but there were a lot of lenders,&quot; one trader said. Most of the banks with excess funds were lending to the Central Bank at 10.5 percent.  </p>
<p>Other banks were investing in reverse repos which remained high despite the slipping Treasury bill rates.</p>
<p>Some banks were also preparing for the 10-year Treasury bond auction to be held next Tuesday. The auction committee has increased the volume to 5.0 billion pesos from 2.0 billion pesos.</p>
<p>The secondary government securities market was active but rates remained flat.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks are not taking positions since they believe rates will correct in the coming weeks. Most of the buyers are just selling them to their clients,&quot; another trader said.  </p>
<p>Three-month bills were being bid between 10.725 and 10.85 percent, while being offered between 10.60 and 10.70 percent.</p>
<p>Six-month bills were being bought between 10.95 and 11.15 percent, while sold between 10.90 to 11.05 percent.</p>
<p>One-year bills were being bid between 11.425 and 11.50 percent, and offered between 11.35 to 11.40 percent.</p>
