<p>Latvian shares were mixed in sluggish summer trade on Wednesday ahead of H1 results, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overall market volume was only 46,000 lats as the bourse's recently introduced index rose by 0.19 percent to 384.32. The Rietumu index eased .004 percent to 152.31.</p>
<p>Dealers said they hoped the seasonal downturn would be reversed when six-month results, due out soon, are released.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is expecting generally good results from the few blue chips, such as Unibanka and Kaija fish cannery,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>He added that the market was anxiously waiting for the half year results from bourse newcomer Olainfarm, a pharmaceutical company, which rose to 2.55 lats from 2.49 lats in trade of 12,700 lats.</p>
<p>The stock, which debuted on the bourse a few weeks ago, has bounced up and down and dealers remain divided over its value. Some brokers say that someone seems to be trying to support it over 2.50 lats.</p>
<p>The official list was mixed, with two shares rising, two easing and Unibanka holding steady at 3.35 lats in trade of 16,800 lats.</p>
<p>The market, which lacks big institutional and portfolio investors, remains largely divorced from trends elsewhere in Europe.</p>
