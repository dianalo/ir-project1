<p>Greek depos were steady but for a drop in the overnight rate and forex forwards were holding morning levels, bonds were idling and ecu/drachma was trading in narrow ranges, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very quiet and forex forwards along with depos are holding early levels unaffected by the central bank's move to leave more funds in the market,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;It was only the overnight rate that eased after the announcement.&quot;</p>
<p>There have been some offers in one- and two-week tenors in forex forwards from abroad, the dealer said.</p>
<p>Bank of Greece drained 100 billion drachmas of 14-day funds at 11.90 percent in its regular depo tender on Wednesday leaving a net amount of about 150 billion drachmas in the system.</p>
<p>Bonds were also unmoved by the injection of more liquidity into the market with prices little changed, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market shrugged off the central bank's move with bond prices basically unchanged,&quot; said a bond dealer. &quot;More than 300 billion drachmas will be drained tomorrow and the market does take this lightly.&quot;</p>
<p>Greece auctioned 100 billion drachmas of 10-year, 8.80 percent fixed coupon bonds on Tuesday. It was Greece's first ever issue of 10-year drachma-denominated bonds.</p>
<p>It also re-opened bids for three-year, 9.8 percent bonds, five-year, 9.2 percent bonds and seven-year, 8.9 percent bonds. Fifty billion drachmas for each maturity are auctioned.</p>
<p>The cut-off prices were set at 100.1, 99.25, 98.77, 98.61 for the three-, five-, seven- and 10-year fixed coupon bonds respectively, the central bank said.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 158.23/33 from Wednesday's 158.315 fix, the dollar at 273.29/39 drachmas from 273.000 and the ecu at 309.35/45 from 309.310 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;Ecu/drachma is locked in tight ranges,&quot; said a forex dealer. &quot;The high for the day was 309.40 but it has eased a bit to 309.24/29 in late quiet trading.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** T/N at 11.40-11.90</p>
<p>** S/N at 11.40-11.90</p>
<p>** One week at 11.40-11.90</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 11.40-11.90</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 11.30-11.80</p>
<p>** One month at 11.30-11.80</p>
<p>** Two months at 11.00-11.50</p>
<p>** Three months at 10.80-11.30</p>
<p>** Six months at 10.50-11.00</p>
<p>** Nine months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 10.20-10.70</p>
