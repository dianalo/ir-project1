<p>European oil swaps generally strengthened on Friday as screen crude drew most of the complex higher.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs were up to 10 cents stronger, gasoline was $3 higher and heavy fuel gained about $1.</p>
<p>Only naphtha bucked the bullish trend with swaps slipping $1.</p>
<p>The gains in Brent CFDs were particularly noticeable in the closer in contracts with June 30-July 4 hovering around -26 cents against August from -37 cents while July 7-11 was put at -28/29 cents from -37 cents. July 14-18 gained to -28/29 cents from -34 cents and July 21-25 was put at -29 cents against August Brent from -30 cents.</p>
<p>Gas oil crack spreads were softer with Q4 slipping to $4.40 from $4.45 while Q198 was broadly steady around $4.60.</p>
<p>Gasoline swaps were about $3 firmer with stronger crude and NYMEX unleaded futures giving a lead. The contracts slipped into a narrow backwardation with July pegged around $183 from $180 while August ticked up to $182.50 from $180 and September edged up to $181.50 from $180.00.</p>
<p>Naphtha was about a $1 weaker with the contango holding at about $1 between July/August and August/September.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel swaps recovered after yesterday's knocking with July valued around $83.50 and August showing a lesser contango of about 75 cents to $1 compared with Thursday's $1.50. Wet barge activity was brisk with barges trading between $82.00 for prompt and $83.50 for first half July.</p>
