<p>&quot;Economic growth halted in June after advancing the previous two months,&quot; Statistics Canada said.</p>

<p>A cutback in manufacturing production and declines in public administration and transportation and storage services were mainly responsible for the disappointing monthly result, Statistics Canada said. Forestry and farm output also fell.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, mining, construction and communication services continued to advance, while retailers enjoyed higher sales for the first time in several months. Wholesale sales and community, business and personal services inches ahead, while growth in finance and related services flattened.</p>
<p>Manufacturing production receded 0.6 percent in June, reaching its lowest level in the second quarter of 1996, though for the second quarter as a whole manufacturing output improved 1.2 percent.</p>
<p>Durable manufacturing dropped 1.4 percent on the month while non-durable manufacturing rose 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>The other main factor, government services, showed a drop of 1.2 percent led by a decline in federal administration.</p>
