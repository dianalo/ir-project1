<p>Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is due to attend a factory opening in a Croat part of Bosnia on Saturday but Western officials said they wanted to see &quot;protocol issues&quot; resolved before attending the ceremony.</p>
<p>Western officials said they wanted to see &quot;appropriate protocol&quot; displayed at the occasion to avoid a repetition of an embarrassing incident last summer when a Croatian flag was hung at a bridge opening in the divided city of Mostar.</p>
<p>The European Union's administrator in Mostar at the time, Sir Martin Garrod and several other international official walked away from the ceremony in protest.</p>
<p>David Foley, spokesman for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said it planned on sending its Mostar representative but was making inquiries beforehand.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to avoid being placed in a potentially embarassing situation. We are making discreet inquiries,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Foley did not say what would be an acceptable protocol, but officials in the Bosnian government said there were ongoing discussions about the use of the federation flag for the occasion.</p>
<p>Tudjman is expected to attend an aluminium factory opening near Mostar at the invitation of Bosnia's three-man presidency. Its Croat member Kresimir Zubak will be the host, government officials said.</p>
<p>Bosnia's fragile Moslem-Croat federation had only recently been granted a flag by its parliament, nearly three years after the federation agreement was signed in March 1994.</p>
<p>Mostar remains bitterly divided into Moslem and Croat sectors despite international efforts to reunite it. The Croat nationalist have especially been slow in dismantling their self-proclaimed &quot;Herzeg-Bosna&quot; mini-state.</p>
<p>Before the federation parliament adopted the flag and coat of arms, the Croats used their version of the neighboring Croatia checkerboard flag. The Moslems claim the white and blue flag with lilies is the state flag, recognised by the U.N.</p>
<p>Moslem-Croat relations deteriorated severely after one Moslem was killed and 22 injured while trying to visit a cemetery in Croat-held Mostar on February 10.</p>
<p>A U.N. investigation identified several Croat police officers as perpetrators and asked for their arrest. Four of six policemen have been suspended recently but international officials continued to demand their arrest.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps President (Franjo) Tudjman can help with the arrests that we still await,&quot; a spokesman for Carl Bildt, the international High Representative in Bosnia, said.</p>
