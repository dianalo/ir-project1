<p>President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday named Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin his full- scale stand-in for the time of his heart surgery, filling in one of the blanks in Russia's rudimentary power transition rules.</p>
<p>&quot;The temporary fulfillment of duties of the president of the Russian Federation...will be carried out by head of government Viktor Chernomyrdin to the full extent, including the power to control strategic and nuclear weapons,&quot; Yeltsin's decree said.</p>
<p>&quot;He will be given the corresponding technical means (the nuclear button) to do this.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin's sudden disappearance from the public eye in late June, right in the middle of his re-election campaign, has prompted speculation about who controls Russia.</p>
<p>The president's announcement earlier this month that he would undergo bypass surgery to improve the blood supply to his heart only fuelled that speculation.</p>
<p>One of the most urgent questions raised by the annoucement was who would look after the nation's huge nuclear force while its leader is unconscious in the operating theatre.</p>
<p>&quot;This decree has been issued to make this politically clear and end all speculation over this topic,&quot; Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing.</p>
<p>The Russian constitution says that the premier replaces the president if the latter is impeached or if his health does not allow him to serve the rest of the term.</p>
<p>But it gives no clue as to who carries out presidential duties if the national leader has to surrender them temporarily.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, rushed to hospital with mild heart attacks twice last year, has hitherto insisted that he was in charge and did not need a substitute.</p>
<p>Yeltsin ordered Chernomyrdin earlier this month to take up some of his powers including coordination of the so-called &quot;power ministries&quot;, mainly the Defence and Interior ministries and Federal Security Service, who report directly to president.</p>
<p>But the mandate was limited and Chernomyrdin was not given the right to chair the policy-making Security Council.</p>
<p>The temporary handover of all powers by the national leader will probably be the first such act in Russia since tsar Ivan the Terrible, who in the late 16th-century kept a little-known nobleman as a formal ruler for several years.</p>
<p>The decree said that closer to the operation Yeltsin will sign a separate decree handing over powers to Chernomyrdin and take them back by yet another decree.</p>
<p>&quot;The mechanism will be put into action after the president issues the next decree,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>Chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais said in a newspaper interview that he expected the president to hand over his duties to Chernomyrdin for a maximum of two days.</p>
<p>NTV commercial television has quoted Kremlin sources as saying that Yeltsin would probably hand over his powers for just the few hours of the actual operation.</p>
<p>The sources say Yeltsin would sign a decree naming Chernomyrdin acting president just before going to the operation and will take back the reins immediately after the operation, when the doctors bring him out of the anaesthetic.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin's doctors, assisted by top U.S. surgeon Michael DeBakey, were due to meet on September 25 to decide when to operate on the president, who aides say is undergoing tests at Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital.</p>
