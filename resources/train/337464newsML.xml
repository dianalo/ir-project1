<p>Chilean shares on Tuesday closed firm for the first time in a week as an early surge on Wall Street helped bring out bargain hunters, traders said.</p>
<p>The rally could be short-lived. U.S. stocks slid late in the session, just as Chile's market was closing. That retreat is seen dragging down stocks at the opening, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;I see stocks down in the morning, but they should stabilize in the afternoon,&quot; said Lance Eckel of brokerage Sud Americano.</p>
<p>The selective  index ended up 1.34 percent at 107.8 points.  </p>
<p>Endesa, a hydroelectric generator, ended up 3.91 percent at 239 pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;Endesa's bouncing back, but there is uncertainty over fourth-quarter earnings,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Investors are concerned Endesa's profits will be hurt by this year's drought, which forced the company to buy power on the expensive spot market.</p>
<p>The gainers on Tuesday included forestry company Masisa, up four percent at 208, and power utility Chilgener, which firmed 3.46 percent to 2,540 pesos.  </p>
<p>Losers included telecom Entel, down 3.46 percent at 2,510 pesos, and pulpmaker Copec, which shed 0.61 percent to 1,60 pesos.</p>
