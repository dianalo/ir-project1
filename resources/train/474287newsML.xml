<text>
<p>South Korea prosecutors on Friday arrested the chairman of the stricken Hanbo Group whose steelmaking flagship collapsed in January, a prosecution official said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Mr Chung Bo-keun was arrested and taken to the Youngdungpo prison,&quot; he said. Chung was taken into custody after being questioned at the prosecutors' office.</p>
<p>The prosecutors accused Chung of pocketing about 37 billion won ($41 million) from Hanbo Group funds. Hanbo, with 22 member firms, is South Korea's 14th largest industrial conglomerate.</p>
<p>Chung's father, Hanbo founder Chung Tae-soo, is standing trial along with nine other people in connection with a loans scandal that has rocked the nation.</p>
<p>Prosecutors reopened their probe into the Hanbo scandal last Friday after the opposition attacked an earlier investigation as a whitewash which failed to bring to justice major players.</p>
