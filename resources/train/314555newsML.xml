<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin is likely to leave hospital in the next few days and attend a summit of former Soviet republics planned later this month, the Kremlin said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It (Yeltsin's departure from hospital) will be in the next few days, but not at the weekend,&quot; presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;We assume that he will take part in the CIS summit,&quot; he added, referring to the meeting of the heads of state of the 12-member Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) planned for January 29.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin, taken to hospital with pneumonia on January 8, was recovering well and had even taken part in an impromptu celebration of his daughter Tatyana's birthday .</p>
<p>He said Yeltsin worked three hours on Friday, preparing his annual address to parliament and considering draft documents and decrees.</p>
<p>&quot;If things continue like this, meetings with the premier can start next week,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said about regular consultations between Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, traditionally held on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who turns 66 on February 1, had multiple heart bypass surgery in November but doctors say this is not connected with the pneumonia.</p>
<p>They have so far been reluctant to set a date for Yeltsin to leave the elite Central Clinical Hospital, warning that pneumonia is a serious illness which carries the risk of possible complications.</p>
<p>But recent statements have had an optimistic tone, and doctors say the president's condition has stabilised.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no reason to think that the doctors' optimism is unfounded,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;The president is certainly interested in recovering as quickly as possible. But I think it is natural to ... show some patience to give him the chance of a recovering completely.&quot;</p>
