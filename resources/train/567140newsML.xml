<p>Pioneer Electronic Corp. said Wednesday it would launch the world's first digital video disc car navigation system in Japan in June.</p>
<p>A company spokeswoman said DVD technology allows the new product to store seven to eight times as much information as conventional car navigation systems, which use CD-ROMs.</p>
<p>The product will have an 8-inch wide-screen liquid crystal display monitor, larger that any navigation system on the market, she said.</p>
<p>Pioneer also plans to sell the product in Europe and the United States but specific launch dates had yet to be decided, she said.</p>
<p>DVDs use a new laser technology that can store up to 4.7 gigabytes of data on each side of a disc, enough to record 133 minutes of film and sound.</p>
<p>The technology is expected eventually to replace CD-ROMs.</p>
<p>Pioneer said it would launch two models of the DVD car navigation system -- one that responds to voices, costing 230,000 yen ($1,840), and another without a voice control system costing 198,000 yen ($1,584).</p>
<p>The television monitor comes separately and will cost 178,000 yen ($1,424).</p>
