<p>Ethiopia's state-owned Coffee Authority on Monday said private traders during the 1996/97 year contributed some 68 percent to total coffee exports.</p>
<p>In a statement, the authority said of the 133,765 tonnes exported in the July-June period up to 91,000 tonnes represented sales by the private traders.</p>
<p>The statement said the figures showed that private traders had improved their performance over state-owned coffee firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Private exporters were able to sell up to 68 percent of the total 133,765 tonnes of coffee the country exported, while state-owned firms were able to sell about 32 percent during the 1996/97 period,&quot; the authority said.</p>
<p>Abudl Razak Sherif board chairman of the private Ethiopian Coffee Exporters Association had forecast in September private sector exports of up to 60,000 tonnes of a projected 108,000 tonnes exportable coffee in 1996/97.</p>
<p>But Ethiopia is enjoying a boom in its coffee industry. Its exports of 133,765 tonnes earned $409.4 million during the same period.</p>
<p>Coffee authorities attributed the boom in its coffee trade to reforms in the industry after years of a Marxist central command economic system.</p>
<p>The authority has forecast coffee exports in 1997/98 at 128,000 tonnes and earnings of around $348 million.</p>
<p>Annual production on the 321,000 hectares of land under coffee is expected to increase to around 300,000 tonnes from 200,000 to 250,000 tonnes at present, the authority said.</p>
