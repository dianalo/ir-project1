<headline>Athens bourse ends lower, seen resuming rally.</headline>
<dateline>ATHENS 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Athens bourse ended down on Monday but market watchers expected the year-end rally to continue tomorrow and a stock market recovery to unfold in mid-January.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a typical year-end rally, where we have block trades, for accounting purposes. The rally has been going on for two weeks but it seems like it reached its climax today,&quot; said Pavlos Vranas, managing director of Euroxx Securities.</p>
<p>He added that the continuing fall in interest rates along with other positive macroeconomic signs should improve market sentiment after the Delta Securities scandal and share prices would continue to firm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Friday the finance ministry auctioned 100 billion drachmas of three-year fixed-coupon bond, which featured a lower coupon of 10.70 percent from 11.0 percent previously.</p>
<p>Also, the seven-year 200 billion drachma FRN was auctioned on the same day featuring a lower base rate of 11.20 percent, down from 11.50 percent in the previous auction.</p>
<p>&quot;There was tremendous demand for the 7-year FRNs,&quot; said Vranas.&quot;</p>
<p>The reasons were the high liquidity of institutional investors and their willingness to invest in the last tax-free issues, as a 7.5 percent tax will begin to be imposed on state debt papers from January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>He added that with taxation bonds have become less attractive and stocks have gained in appeal.</p>
<p>But the public has not shown the expected reallocation of funds from bonds to equities and a strong reason for that was investors' loss of confidence in the Athens stock exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the climate is bad and we are faced with a credibility crisis in the market. Stock prices are very attractive and investors should enter the market at such levels,&quot; said broker Vagelis Haratsis of Beta Securities.</p>
<p>He added that he expected trading volume to fluctuate around 2.0-2.5 billion drachmas, in early January, when the year-end rally ends and we will see &quot;real&quot; volume -- not boosted by block trades.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed down 0.53 percent or 4.99 points at 929.47 from Friday's 934.46. It opened at 934.91. Trading volume was 15.9 billion drachmas on volume of 10.4 million shares in active block trading.</p>
<p>Losers led gainers 107 to 93 with 28 issues unchanged on 228 traded.</p>
<p>Banks lost 0.83 percent, construction fell 1.21 percent while small caps declined 0.38 percent and investment shares gained 0.60 percent. industrials slipped 0.20 percent.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted at 569.00-587.00. Shares of OTE telecom the underlying, lost 20 drachmas at 4,185.</p>
<p>The recently launched ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted at $7.89-$8.89. The strike price is set at $99.60 and the warrants expire October 8, 1997.</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley Hellenic Blue Chip Warrant, which has a strike price of 100 marks, was quoted at 3,213-3,415 drachmas. --Margarita Sotiropoulou, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
