<p>Gainsco Inc, reporting declining revenues and profits for the first half, said Wednesday it expected better performance for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel comfortable with an improving bottomline for the second half,&quot; said chief executive Joseph Macchia in an interview. He added the insurer expected to write between $115 million to $125 million in gross premiums and post at least an 18 percent return on equity for the full year.</p>
<p>With shareholders equity of $109.4 million on December 31, the insurer said it expects an after-tax $19.7 million profit for the full year.</p>
<p>Gainsco Wednesday reported a $4.4 million net on gross premiums of $26.9 million in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a $4.5 million net on $29.2 million in gross premiums in the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>For the first half, Gainco earned $7.6 million and wrote $50.0 million in gross premiums, compared with an $8.8 million net and $53.8 milion in gross premiums in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>Macchia said the company returned an annualized 13.9 percent on shareholders' equity in the first half.</p>
<p>The chief executive projected better results in the second half because the insurer &quot;tightened up its underwriting,&quot; scrapping taxi insurance programs in New Jersey and Connecticut and a coal truck insurance program in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Macchia added he expected a new dealer-oriented car insurance program in Texas to contribute to earnings in the second half.</p>
<p>The insurer's stock traded at 9-3/16 Wednesday morning, up 1/8. Wednesday, 6 August 1997 14:00:49 ENDS  nN06222882</p>
