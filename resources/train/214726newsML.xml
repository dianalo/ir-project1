<p>Pakistan's textile industry said on Monday it welcomed a government relief package, but some said lifting the ban on imports of machinery and raw cotton from India could further help the ailing sector.</p>
<p>The government announced on Saturday the lifting of a five percent customs duty on raw cotton imports. It also slashed duties on polyester fibre and its raw materials while keeping intact the policy of unrestricted tax-free export of raw cotton.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a timely step to save the industry that has been going through a very rough period,&quot; Humayun Elahi Sheikh, vice-chairman of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA), told Reuters.</p>
<p>Officials estimate cotton production will exceed nine million 375-lb bales in 1996/97 (July-June) after pest damage during the past few months, mainly in Punjab province, the major cotton producer.</p>
<p>That estimate is down from earlier predictions of 10 million bales and last year's production of 9.96 million.</p>
<p>Sheikh said a shortage of raw cotton due to a smaller crop and unrestricted exports had forced 107 mills out of a total of 461 to close.</p>
<p>Pakistan exported 1.8 million bales in 1995/96 compared to 230,000 bales in 1994/95 after the government lifted an export ban in February 1995.</p>
<p>Sheikh said the high price of locally produced synthetic fibre and the protections against imported fibre had kept mills from using imports or more fibre in blending.</p>
<p>He said the industry had an average blending ratio of 15 percent to 20 percent of synthetic fibre with cotton compared to 55 percent in other textile centres.</p>
<p>The government said the duty on imported polyester fibre had also been reduced to five percent from 15 percent to encourage their use. A five percent excise duty on polyester fibre had been removed to lower domestic prices, it said.</p>
<p>A 10 percent duty on the import of purified terephthalic acid and monoethylene glycol, raw materials for polyester fibre, had also been removed to protect the local industry, it said.</p>
<p>However, Sheikh said he hoped the government would also announce a fresh rescheduling and restructuring of loans and easy access to capital.</p>
<p>Shahid Javed Burki, economic adviser to the prime minister, said on Saturday the government was examining further improvements in the sector.</p>
<p>Anwar Tata, former APTMA chairman, applauded the package but said the lifting of a 1971 ban on importing textile machinery and raw cotton from neighbouring India could save the industry billions of rupees.</p>
<p>&quot;Indian machinery costs ten times less than what we import from Europe and the Far East,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maqbool Sadiq, head of the private Karachi Cotton Association (KCA), said the package would offer safeguards because it allows free exports of raw cotton while meeting the domestic textile industry's rising demands.</p>
<p>Traders at the Karachi Cotton Exchange said the package would bring down cotton prices, which had been rising because of expectations of a smaller crop.</p>
<p>&quot;Spinners would be looking at prices below the 2,300 rupees ($57.18) level after the cuts in import duties,&quot; dealer Amir Nasim said.</p>
<p>The official spot rates issued by the KCA on Sunday dropped 27.50 rupees each to 2,350 rupees for NIAB-78 variety, 2,515 rupees for K-68 and 2,525 rupees for MNH-93.</p>
