<text>
<p>Los Angeles County officially opened its new $373 million downtown jail on Wednesday, but county officials said some of the funding for the facility was in jeopardy.</p>
<p>In order to fully fund the 4,000-bed Twin Towers Correctional Facility, the county said it planned to lease out some of its jail space to the state and federal government.</p>
<p>These contracts, however, have yet to be finalized, county spokeswoman Judy Hammond said.  </p>
<p>At Wednesday's opening ceremony, Gov. Pete Wilson called on the state legislature to quickly approve the state contract with the county to ensure Twin Towers becomes fully operational.</p>
<p>&quot;Public safety should be a critical concern to every member of the Assembly and state Senate and I'm confident that they'll agree with everyone here today that this facility must go forward,&quot; Wilson said.</p>
<p>In late January, nearly 200 inmates were moved into the facility. The jail should be fully operational by June, assuming remaining funding issues are resolved, Hammond said.</p>
<p>The county plans to transfer dangerous criminals currently being housed in low- and medium-security facilities into the new, high-security jail.</p>
