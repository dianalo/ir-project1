<p>Palm oil prices are forecast to fall after the holiday season ends in Asia, European traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the February PORLA data is going to be the key to the market, after that we will see prices fall,' said one trader.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Palm Oil Resignation and Licensing Authority (PORLA) is due to release its next Malaysian crop report on February 15.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on the Malaysian export figures we have already seen for January, things are not looking to good and even if Wong's estimate of around a 10 percent fall in Malaysian palm oil output is correct stocks will be about the same as in December,' said a trader.</p>
<p>Traders said even before the PORLA date is issued the market could find it a struggle to maintain its present levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook isn't that bright, China is only buying its normal amount of palm oil and India and Pakistan cannot afford to buy at the current levels.&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Traders said palm oil needed to regain its competitive edge over other edible oils and the only way this is going to happen is if there is a downward correction.</p>
<p>Earlier this month traders expressed surprise at the level of local disappearance when PORLA released its December figures, but they feel that this will be straighten out in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>&quot;Palm oil production is always low during February owing to the holidays and this will be the time for PORLA to straighten out some of the odd ball figures we have had,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>On Tuesday crude palm oil prices rose in active trading in Europe on fears over a possible increase in Indonesia's export tax on crude palm oil and olein, but not all traders agree.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at prices so far this month I would say that any increase is only going to be a matter of a few dollars for crude palm oil and olein, nothing to worry about, said a Singapore based trader.</p>
<p>Coconut oil prices in Europe have remained surprisingly stable dispute slow shipments from origin and in the last week nearby prices have declined by $5 a tonne, small amount for a normally volatile market.</p>
<p>But traders report little demand at present. &quot;I think most people are covered at the moment, but there are always one or two shorts about,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Coconut oil stocks held in Rotterdam on January 27 stood at 21,593 tonnes against 20,732 the previous week.</p>
<p>However traders were unable to say how much of these stocks had already been sold and how much was held in private tanks.</p>
<p>In the soft oils market prices have more less followed the Chicago market, but demand has been low.</p>
<p>&quot;No one really belives Chicago and this has led to a slow down in trade,&quot; said a trader.</p>
