<p>Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan failed in talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to persuade Israel to end sanctions it imposed on Palestinians after a double suicide bombing.</p>
<p>&quot;If they begin to fight terrorism, we will review the various steps that were taken in order to make them fight terrorism,&quot; Netanyahu said after a three-hour meeting with King Hussein's younger brother.</p>
<p>&quot;We are firm in the measures we have taken,&quot; the right-wing Israeli leader said.</p>
<p>Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the July 30 twin bombings killed 15 people including the two bombers in a Jerusalem street market. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat condemned the closure as collective punishment.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday the Middle East peace process could not proceed unless Israel was convinced the Palestinian Authority was doing all it could to maintain security in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the parties trust each other and until the Israelis believe that the Palestinian Authority is making 100 percent effort, which is different from 100 percent results, but is making 100 percent effort on security, it is impossible for peace to proceed,&quot; Clinton told a news conference.</p>
<p>Earlier, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she would visit the Middle East at the end of August provided progress was made in security there.</p>
<p>&quot;Provided there is some progress on security issues I am prepared to travel to the Middle East at the end of this month,&quot; Albright said in a speech prepared for delivery to the National Press Club.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office, in a statement, welcomed Albright's speech calling it &quot;serious&quot; and said &quot;much thought was invested in it&quot;.</p>
<p>The statement said Netanyahu and Albright spoke on Wednesday evening at which time the prime minister stressed &quot;the need for the PLO to fulfil its commitments and to fight terrorism&quot;.</p>
<p>U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross has already scheduled a trip to the Middle East starting this weekend.</p>
<p>Israel announced a slight easing of an &quot;internal closure&quot; in the West Bank and Gaza but said the ban on entering the Jewish state remained in force.</p>
<p>An Israel Army statement said Palestinians had been allowed since Wednesday morning to reach workplaces at Jewish settlements and industrial zones in the two areas.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office said King Hussein telephoned the prime minister and thanked him &quot;for the warm reception given the crown prince and said that he hopes to see Prime Minister Netanyahu soon&quot;. The prime minister's office also said Crown Prince Hassan telephoned Netanyahu and thanked him.</p>
<p>Netanyahu is expected to visit Jordan next week for talks with King Hussein.</p>
<p>Crown Prince Hassan described the situation as &quot;a very dangerous crisis&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be no peace without security and there can be no security without peace,&quot; he said. &quot;We must not forget the basic issues...Jerusalem, refugees, water, borders,&quot; Prince Hassan told the news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But unless we overcome positively the daily issues and stand together responsibly on the issues of security it will be hard to move on to a comprehensive solution.&quot;</p>
<p>After the Jerusalem attack, the deadliest against Israelis in a year, Netanyahu suspended a resumption of Israel-PLO talks at committee level on so-called confidence-building measures such as opening air and sea ports in Gaza.</p>
<p>Chief PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Israel of treating Palestinians like hostages.</p>
<p>&quot;The Israeli measures indicated the Israeli government's readiness to launch a war on the Palestinian Authority, President Arafat and the Palestinian people,&quot; Erekat told a news conference in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said it was not Israel's intention to inflict &quot;undue suffering&quot; on Palestinians and it had allowed humanitarian supplies of food and medicine into self-ruled areas.</p>
<p>But in answer to a question he rejected a U.S. call to unfreeze 70 million shekels ($19.8 million) of tax revenues which Israel has withheld from the Palestinian Authority since the bombing.</p>
