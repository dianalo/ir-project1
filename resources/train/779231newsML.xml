<title>USA: Aetna, HMO peers bruised by Q2 earnings.</title>
<headline>Aetna, HMO peers bruised by Q2 earnings.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Disappointing second-quarter earnings by Aetna Inc's Aetna U.S. Healthcare unit sharply depressed the company's shares Tuesday, causing jitters and profit taking in Oxford Health Plans and United HealthCare Corp.</p>
<p>Aetna, whose shares did not begin trading until almost two hours after the New York Stock Exhange opened, were off 12-13/16 to 104/3/16 in early afternoon trade.  </p>
<p>Aetna shares were also bruised by a downgrade from Smith Barney, which cut its rating on the company to outperform from buy, citing disappointment with its managed-care performance in the 1997 second quarter.</p>
<p>Oxford was off 3-15/16 to 81-7/8 despite its release earlier Tuesday of second quarter earnings of $0.45 per share, one cent higher than the First Call consensus analysts' estimate.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently the Aetna downgrade was disappointing to investors and Oxford fell off in sympathy,&quot; said PaineWebber health care analyst David Lothson.  </p>
<p>&quot;Smith Barney has been extremely bullish on these (managed health care) stocks for a long time, so when they downgrade a company, people get real nervous they're going to downgrade others,&quot; Lothson said.</p>
<p>Smith Barney expressed concern that Aetna's medical loss ratio increased one percent sequentially from 82.6 percent in the 1997 first quarter to 83.6 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The ratio is a measure of the portion of premium revenues paid out to cover medical costs of members.  </p>
<p>And, Smith Barney cited a sequential decrease in Aetna's Health Risk business, where operating earnings slipped from $198 million in the 1997 first quarter to $172 million in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The business segment includes products in which Aetna assumes all or a majority of health care cost and utilization risk. Aetna said higher premium rates were more than offset by increases in commercial and Medicare HMO medical costs.</p>
<p>Lothson said concerns about HMO profitability in the wake of the Aetna earnings report apparently pinched shares of United HealthCare Corp, which was off 1-13/16 to 57-15/16.  </p>
<p>Lothson said he was maintaining his neutral rating on the HMO group. &quot;There's too much excess underwriting capacity out there to promote much pricing flexibility. And earnings in that environment are at risk,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gary Frazier, a Bear, Stearns managing director, said the market seemed quite concerned about the &quot;slight uptick&quot; in Aetna's Medicare costs.</p>
<p>&quot;So a lot of HMOs that have exposure to the Medicare side of the business are selling off, including Oxford, which is building its Medicare business,&quot; Frazier said.  </p>
<p>Frazier said the market apparently was also concerned by Oxford's announcement Tuesday that founder Stephen Wiggins would be relinquishing his CEO, although remaining active as company chairman.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think anything has changed in terms of Stephen Wiggins' day-to-day responsibilities. You'll continue to see his strong imprint going forward,&quot; Frazier predicted.</p>
