<text>
<p>Kabul's main airbase at Bagram, north of the Afghan capital, was shelled by ousted government forces on Friday and the ruling Taleban militia replied with helicopter gunships, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said at least six shells landed inside the perimeters of the base, 50 km (30 miles) from Kabul, but it was not immediately known whether there was any damage.  </p>
<p>The forces of the former government, driven from Kabul two weeks ago by the purist Islamic Taleban militia, fired at the gunships with anti-aircraft guns but hit neither, they said.</p>
<p>The attack was one of a series on Taleban positions on Thursday and Friday, well behind their front lines in the Salang pass through the Hindu Kush mountains where the militia is fighting the forces of former government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood.</p>
