<headline>Suharto said well after health rumours hit market.</headline>

<p>Rumours that President Suharto would undergo a medical check-up in Germany jolted Indonesia's financial markets again on Friday, even though sources in the presidential palace denied there were such plans.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no such plan and there's no indication at all the president will have a new medical check-up,&quot; one source told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not true he will travel to Germany for a check-up,&quot; another palace source said.</p>
<p>The Indonesian rupiah was driven down to 2,406.5 against the dollar by the rumours, which dealers said came from Singapore traders, before settling at 2.404.8/05.8 by mid-morning.</p>
<p>Stock market trading was slow as most investors remained sidelined following the rumours. At 0519 GMT, the Jakarta composite index was off 0.32 percent at 639.58 points.</p>
<p>Suharto, 75, went to Germany for a medical check-up last year and was declared healthy for the man of his age.</p>
<p>Indonesian stock and foreign exchanges markets were roiled by fears over the health of the president, who has yet to publicly announce a successor.</p>
<p>Witneses said Suharto appeared healthy on Friday as he fulfilled his official duties during the day. These included a meetings with the secretary-general of China's state council and participants at a high-ranking meeting of armed forces' officials at the state Merdeka Palace.</p>
<p>The witnesses said Suharto, leader of the world's most populous Moslem nation, then attended Friday prayers with the military officers at a mosque in the palace grounds.</p>
<p>Several Jakarta-based newspapers carried stories and pictures of Suharto on Friday. They denied rumours that he had been ill on Thursday and confirmed he had carried out his normal office duties.</p>
<p>Palace sources said late on Thursday that Suharto was at home and in good health after a normal day's activities, despite rumours on foreign exchange markets that he was ill.</p>
<p>&quot;These rumours are crazy. The president is at home and in good health,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>Suharto's advancing age is unlikely to affect his nomination for a seventh, five-year term in office next year, political and diplomatic analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Senior diplomatic sources said there was no indication that Suharto, whose 30-year rule has brought stability and economic growth to the sprawling archipelago of 200 million people, intended to step aside, saying he was still very much in control.</p>
