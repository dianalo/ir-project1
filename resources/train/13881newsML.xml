<p>Spot electricity prices in the midwestern U.S. on Monday were generally unchanged from Friday's levels due to lackluster demand, market sources said.</p>
<p>An overall cool summer will likely leave peak usage records in the Midwest untested as the season draws to a close after the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>But a hot weather system is predicted to reach the upper half of the Midwest next week, while the lower portion is expected to experience normal to cooler-than-normal weather.</p>
<p>Flat demand and ample generating capacity to subdue buying interests today, brokers and marketers said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people are trying to sell,&quot; one Midwest-based marketer said.</p>
<p>In the East Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement (ECAR), non-firm, peak electricity for Tuesday delivery was quoted at $17.50-$18.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), compared with Friday's $18.00 for Monday delivery.</p>
<p>Non-firm, off-peak ECAR power for next-day delivery was discussed in the $10.00-$11.00, flat from Friday.</p>
<p>Next-day electricity for delivery at the border of ECAR and the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect power pool was offered at $22.00-$23.00.</p>
<p>In the Mid-American Interpool Network (MAIN), non-firm, peak power prices for Tuesday were assessed at $16.50-$17.50, compared with Friday's $18.00 area.</p>
<p>MAIN power for non-firm, off-peak delivery Tuesday was valued at $11.00, compared with Friday's $10.00-$11.00.</p>
<p>In the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), non-firm, peak electricity for Tuesday was quoted at $15.00-$17.00, similar to Friday's $17.00-$18.00 range.</p>
<p>MAPP electricity for non-firm, off-peak delivery was pegged at the $11.00 area.</p>
<p>In the Southwest Pool Pool (SPP), non-firm, peak electricity for Tuesday was quoted at $19.50-$20.00, up from Friday's $18.00-$18.50.</p>
<p>September SPP prices were notationally assessed at $18.50-$19.50.</p>
<p>The ECAR district includes Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, lower Michigan, western Pennsylvania, northern Tennessee and northwestern Virginia.</p>
<p>The MAPP region is made up of Nebraska, Minnesota, the Dakotas, eastern Montana and western Wisconsin, and the MAIN district includes Illinois, northeastern Missouri, eastern Wisconsin and the Michigan pennisula.</p>
<p>The SPP region includes Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, parts of eastern and northern Texas, southeastern New Mexico, southwestern Missouri and western Mississippi.</p>
