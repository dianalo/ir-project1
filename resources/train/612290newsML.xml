<title>RUSSIA: Chechen leader offers reward for missing reporters.</title>

<p>Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov has offered a reward of $100,000 for information on the whereabouts of seven Russian journalists abducted by bandits in the turbulent region, Interfax news agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Chechen authorities have also pledged anonymity for anybody coming forward with information, it said.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Kazbek Makhashev went on local television to appeal for the journalists' immediate release and said their kidnappers might face the death penalty. The missing journalists include a correspondent of Itar-Tass news agency and three Radio Russia reporters, abducted several months ago, and an NTV television film crew who disappeared earlier this month.</p>
<p>The kidnappings have undermined Chechnya's efforts to restore order and stability since a peace deal last August put an end to 21 months of bloody fighting between pro-independence rebels and Russian troops.</p>
<p>Other journalists have been kidnapped in recent months, including an Italian photographer, but have later been released.</p>
<p>In a further worrying development on Saturday, one of the candidates for the post of mayor in Chechnya's capital Grozny went missing and his car was found burned out, Interfax said.</p>
<p>It said Yakub Usmanov was one of the leading candidates and had been due to meet the mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov on Saturday in the Russian capital.</p>
<p>Local and parliamentary elections are due to be held in Chechnya on May 31.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Usmanov's National Independence Party as saying the apparent abduction was an &quot;extremely serious challenge&quot; to the Chechen authorities.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Maskhadov and Russia's President Boris Yeltsin signed a peace accord, promising an end to 400 years of intermittent conflict between Moscow and the oil-rich north Caucasus region.</p>
<p>Under last August's truce a final decision on the vexed issue of Chechnya's status has been deferred until 2001. The Chechens want full independence but Moscow says Chechnya must remain part of Russia.</p>
