<p>Slovenian shares firmed 1.71 percent on Wednesday on continued foreign buying and market participants said the growth was expected to last for at least another two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign demand is strong in line with a general trend of foreign interest in securities of the countries of Eastern Europe,&quot; said Danilo Grasic, head of investment sector of the Slovenian branch of bank Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>Traders said issue A of drug company Lek, which has soared 41.5 percent since being listed in September 1996, continued to attract the most foreign interest, followed by companies like trader Mercator, bank SKB, food maker Kolinska and health resort operator Terme Catez.</p>
<p>The ISB index rose 22.96 points to 1,368.8. Turnover rose to 386.6 million tolars from 181.3 million. Among its constituents 15 shares rose, three fell, one was unchanged and six were not traded.</p>
<p>Issue A of Lek was the most actively traded, rising 4.63 percent to 28,920 tolars on volume of 7,776 shares for total turnover of 224.1 million tolars.</p>
