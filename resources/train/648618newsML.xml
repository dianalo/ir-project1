<p>Mongolia plans to privatise 200 state-owned businesses over the next 18 months and will also take steps to privatise land ownership, Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan has said.</p>
<p>The businesses to be privatised include the National airline, Miat, as well as the Gobi Cashmere Factory, Mongolia's second biggest source of foreign exchange, Enkhsaikhan said late last week.</p>
<p>He gave no specific timetable for the privatisations, saying only that the programme to privatise 200 state units would be carried out in 18 months.</p>
<p>Enkhsaikhan has said privatisation is one of the highest priorities of his 10-month-old reformist government with plans to sell off most state enterprises over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Privatisation of land, a reform that has yet to be approved by parliament, was another important reform for Mongolia, he said.</p>
<p>Mongolia held its first land auction this month, selling off three small sites in the capital to local companies in the first move toward privatisation of land.</p>
<p>Privatisation of land will be limited to urban areas while pasture land in this landlocked steppe nation of herdsmen will be held as common land.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether last month's election of Natsagiin Bagabandi, candidate of the former communist party, as president in an upset for the government's reformist President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat would affect the government's plans.</p>
<p>Some Western diplomats have expressed concern that the new president, to be inaugurated on June 20, might slow the pace of Mongolia's market style reforms, particularly its plans for privatisation.</p>
