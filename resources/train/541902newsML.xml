<p>Outside a betting shop in east London, Jim Marshall makes the gesture that British politicians fear. He shrugs his shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't know if I'll vote...all the parties, they're all the same,&quot; said Marshall, 19, who is unemployed.</p>
<p>Marshall, a first-time voter in the Mile End district of the capital, is one of an army of voting doubtfuls which registers in opinion polls as &quot;don't knows&quot;.</p>
<p>Recent polls show more than a quarter of Britain's 44 million voters may still be open to persuasion before polling day on Thursday.</p>
<p>Worse for party strategists than the don't knows are the waverers, another large bloc currently giving only lukewarm support to the party of their choice.</p>
<p>With less than a week to go, these people may yet be tempted by the charms and promises of another party, upsetting the pollsters' predictions that the main opposition Labour Party is heading for a landslide victory.</p>
<p>According to a MORI poll published on Thursday in the Times, 26 percent of the voting population may yet change their mind, surprisingly high at this late stage in the campaign.</p>
<p>These people could play havoc with Labour's poll lead of around 20 points, even though surveys show more Conservative supporters are uncertain about their final decision than Labour voters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some reassurance for Labour in the fact that more of their supporters seem to have made up their minds. This is unusual, as Labour support tends not to be as solid as for the other parties,&quot; said Nick Moon, head of social and political research at NOP.</p>
<p>The size of the wavering contingent has prompted the electoral rune-readers to make lower predictions for voter turnout than in 1992, when 78 percent of the voting population cast their ballot.</p>
<p>The latest average prediction from a Reuters panel of voting experts, polled last Monday (21st), puts the expected turnout at 73.3 percent.</p>
<p>Other polls show that first-time voters like Marshall are the people who are turning away from the politicians.</p>
<p>A Times/MORI survey showed that only half of the 18 to 24 age group would be certain to vote.</p>
<p>This would be bad news for Labour, which tends to do well with the younger generation.</p>
<p>Another vital constituency which may decisively influence the result is Britain's ethnic minorities, a significant community in areas of the country which traditionally support Labour.</p>
<p>The Voice, a leading newspaper for blacks, highlighted the dilemma for black voters in a recent editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;For a growing swathe of the country, the fast-approaching election is of no relevance at all,&quot; the Voice wrote. But the newspaper pointed out that it was not a lack of interest, but Westminster's lack of relevance to the black community, which promoted the apathy.</p>
<p>&quot;Various commentators have implied that the reluctance of black and young people to the election is due to political apathy or an ignorance of the issues. Nothing could be further from the truth,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A cross-party charity called Operation Black Vote, supported by leading entertainers, sports stars and personalities, has launched a campaign across Britain in a bid to persuade ethnic minorities to vote.</p>
