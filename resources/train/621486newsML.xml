<p>French President Jacques Chirac said on Wednesday that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's pledge to cease aiming nuclear missiles at NATO countries was more far-reaching than he was given credit for.</p>
<p>&quot;The unexpected and entirely positive promise made by the Russian president concerning Russia's nuclear warheads went beyond what was reported by the press and some commentators,&quot; Chirac told a cabinet meeting, according to government spokesman Alain Lamassoure.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's pledge came in an apparently off-the-cuff statement made during Tuesday's signing ceremony for a security pact between NATO and Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;I have taken a decision today. Everything that is aimed at countries present here, all of those weapons, are going to have their warheads removed,&quot; Yeltsin said to applause from the leaders of the 16 states making up the military shield which protected the West from the now-defunct Soviet Union.</p>
<p>His statement caught both his fellow leaders and his own delegation off guard.</p>
<p>Russian officials later said that what Yeltsin meant to say was that Russia would stop the permanent targetting of missiles against the West but not remove warheads.</p>
<p>Chirac said Yeltsin's promise would be fulfilled in three stages, according to Lamassoure.</p>
<p>In the first stage, the missiles' targeting mechanisms would be deprogrammed.</p>
<p>In a second stage, to be carried out immediately afterwards, the warheads will be separated from the missiles intended to carry them to their targets.</p>
<p>In a final stage, whose timing remains unclear, the warheads themselves will be destroyed, Chirac was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;So it is a very far-reaching decision,&quot; Chirac was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The United States and Russia had previously agreed in arms control talks no longer to target each other's cities, but Yeltsin's decision appeared to go further and include the entire territory of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).</p>
<p>Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, had told reporters on Tuesday: &quot;In future, the situation is possible when the warheads will be dismantled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think, judging by everything, this initiative was triggered by the atmosphere of goodwill and welcome which dominates the summit,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>The Interfax news agency quoted a military source as saying that Yeltsin's move was largely symbolic. &quot;Targeting back warheads is a matter of minutes,&quot; the unnamed source said.</p>
<p>He added, though, that de-targeting and removal of warheads had its practical side. &quot;Such a step considerably reduces the possibility of an accidental missile launch.&quot;</p>
