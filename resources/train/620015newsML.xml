<headline>Mexico stocks off on Cetes hike, lack of interest.</headline>

<p>Mexican stocks edged down on slow cautious trade at the open on Wednesday as investors counted the extra cost of doing business in the wake of primary rate hikes and foreign brokers stayed away, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a cocktail of adverse factors.  Interest rates are up, the Dow is off and Brazil is strong, and there's news of guerrilla attacks here, so why bother with Mexico?&quot; a desk trader said.  The blue chip IPC index  .MXX was down 3.39 points in the opening minutes of trade, or 0.09 percent, at 3,957.47. Trading volume  .TV.MX was anemic at 604,000 shares.  </p>
<p>Clashes between guerrillas and the Mexican army on Tuesday left five dead in the southwestern state of Guerrero, officials said. The attacks followed others reported on Saturday, after several months of inactivity.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico placed bellwether 28-day Cetes rates at 18.31 percent at Tuesday night's primary auction, a hike of 24 basis points since last week.</p>
<p>This compared with a rise of 12 basis points predicted in a Reuters survey conducted before the auction took place.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones was meanwhile down 24.47 points to 7,358.94.  </p>
<p>Floor traders said they saw little dealing activity.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a selloff; not much is happening yet; it's rather apathetic.  Some blue chips are in supply, but others are flat and holding up the market,&quot; one floor trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers said financial stock Bancomer and telecom firm Telmex weighed most on the downside, in terms of volume traded, and also headed the sliders' list .PL.MX.</p>
<p>Telmex L shares were down 10 centavos to 17.36 pesos, shadowing its ADRs, which were off 1/4 at 43-7/8.  </p>
<p>Bancomer B shares had fallen three centavos to 2.97 pesos. Dealers said the stock was sensitive to higher interest rates, which tended to exacerbate past-due loans problems for banks in general.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 26 stocks had changed hands, of which decliners outstripped gainers by 12 to four.</p>
