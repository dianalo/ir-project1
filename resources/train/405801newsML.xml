<p>President Abraham Lincoln did not really sleep there and some say the room is haunted, but that did not deter the rich and powerful and friends of President Bill Clinton from staying in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House.</p>
<p>Reeling from a Democratic fund-raising controversy, the White House on Tuesday released the list of 938 guests who stayed overnight in the White House during Clinton's first term, trying to prove that most who spent the night were not major political campaign contributors.</p>
<p>Lumping people into categories, the White House broke down the 938 guests as: 370 Arkansas friends, 155 long-time friends, 111 friends and supporters, 128 public officials and dignitaries, 67 representing arts and letters, 35 family, and 72 friends of Clinton's daughter Chelsea.</p>
<p>The White House was unable to say exactly how many of the 938 made a campaign contribution to the Democratic Party. But White House officials acknowledged that in many cases major donors received invitations for sleepovers as a thank-you for their support.</p>
<p>Out of a top 10 list of major donors provided to Clinton two years ago, at least four were on the list as having stayed overnight either in the Lincoln Bedroom or other rooms upstairs in the White House.</p>
<p>The White House is the ultimate bed and breakfast, and the Lincoln Bedroom is steeped in history: It served as Abraham Lincoln's office and Cabinet room and it was where he signed the Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves. The story goes that Old Abe's ghost lurks there. It has been a bedroom since about 1900.</p>
<p>The people who have stayed overnight either there or in other bedrooms includes a who's who of some of Hollywood's best and brightest: Barbra Streisand, Candice Bergen, Chevy Chase, Ted Danson, Richard Dreyfus, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen, among many others.</p>
<p>The Arkansas friends make up the largest part of the list, including everybody from the Rev. Rex Horne, pastor of the Baptist church in Little Rock that Clinton attended, to television directors Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth Thomason.</p>
<p>The &quot;friends and supporters&quot; section included many political boosters and contributors, such as California businessman Ronald Burkle.</p>
<p>But there were also people who Clinton simply liked to talk to, such as ex-Chrysler chairman Lee Iaccoca or Robert Schuller, the television evangelist who helped inspire Clinton's second inauguration address Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Many recognisable names were among the public officials and dignitaries section, including former presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter, British Prime Minister John Major and King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold,&quot; Clinton said in defence of his use of the White House.</p>
<p>A White House spokeswoman, Ann Lewis, said invitations for people to stay overnight were &quot;never contingent upon a campaign contribution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very special place,&quot; she said. &quot;And all of us who work here know that we are lucky to walk in here every day, and the president and Mrs. Clinton revere the White House.&quot;</p>
