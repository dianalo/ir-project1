<p>German call money rates eased to around 3.05 percent on Friday after the Bundesbank injected additional funds to offset a liquidity squeeze which resulted as dealers scrambled to meet a higher reserve requirement.</p>
<p>Rates traded between 3.00/15 percent today after hitting 3.20 percent on Thursday as the market reacted to a higher than expected 40 billion mark January reserve requirement.</p>
<p>The central bank this morning set a quick tender and awarded 3.2 billion marks of funds which will remain in the market for five days. Dealers said the step was expected and largely responsible for helping rates come off again.  </p>
<p>Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the move was designed to bring money market rates back to the recent average rates of around three percent. He also said the move signaled German interest rates would remain steady in the near-term.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has kept its main money market, the repo, fixed at three percent since late August and today's funds were again awarded at that rate.</p>
<p>Banks held 42.4 billion marks in non-interest bearing accounts at the Bundesbank on Thursday, up from Wednesday's 41.9 billion marks held.  </p>
<p>The monthly average rose to 40.3 billion marks from 40.2 billion marks. Banks borrowed 100 million marks at the Lombard facility.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average was set at 3.12800 percent on Friday after 3.15683 percent.</p>
