<p>Russia must take action to make foreign investment &quot;safer&quot; if it wants strong economic growth, and the United States will work with Moscow to achieve this, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There remain serious problems in the Russian economy that President (Boris) Yeltsin has addressed quite forcefully over the past few days,&quot; Berger told a press conference two days before President Clinton and Yeltsin begin a summit in Helsinki.</p>
<p>Yeltsin in recent days named young reformers to a new economic team, including his chief-of-staff, Anatoly Chubais, to head his new economic policy team.</p>
<p>&quot;He has a new economic team, which is a vigorous one, and we want to work with him and with his economic team to promote trade and investment on which Russia's growth depends,&quot; Berger said. &quot;If Russia does those things which make foreign investment safer and more stable and more secure, we believe that there is a very substantial amount of foreign investment that is interested in the Russian market,&quot; he said.</p>
