<dateline>HAMPTON, N.H. 1997-06-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Waste Management Inc. said Friday it bid $15 a share to acquire the 33 percent of Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. it doesn't already own.</p>
<p>Waste Management now owns about 67 percent of Wheelabrator's 157 million outstanding shares, Wheelabrator said in a news release.</p>
<p>Wheelabrator, a company that specializes in converting waste products into energy, was trading at $12.75 Friday when its stock was halted on the New York Stock Exchange shortly before the offer was announced.</p>
<p>Wheelabrator will appoint a special committee of independent directors to review Waste Management's proposal, the company said.</p>
<p>The offer requires approval from both the special committee and the holders of a majority of shares not owned by Waste Management, Wheelabrator said.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to enlist the assistance of a law firm and an investment banking firm for the review.</p>
