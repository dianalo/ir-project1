<headline>LIFFE white sugar in range as NY fails to inspire.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>White sugar futures failed to take much inspiration from New York on Monday as most traders preferred to remain sidelined on the whites while the raws repositioned after the March expiry.</p>
<p>May dominated London activity throughout the day, hitting its head on initial resistance at $310.00 but then backing off to hover around its $309.10 open level.</p>
<p>Earlier, a mixed bag of sellers pushed the May contract lower, with the weakness partially offset by trade buying.</p>
<p>But New York's spot May contract then nudged over 11.00 cents/lb after its weaker open, reaching a high of 11.08 and causing the May/May arbitrage to narrow.</p>
<p>In London the strength on the raws was not enough to produce a concerted rally and at 1635 GMT May stood just 10 cents firmer at $309.10, its own opening level.</p>
<p>August was unchanged at $308.10 and overall volume reached a light 767 lots, nearly all of which was in May and also boosted by crosses.</p>
<p>Bangladesh was said to have bought a cargo of 150 ICUMSA white sugar, probably Indian in origin, from a London-based trade house at around $346 a tonne c &amp; f.</p>
<p>Activity on the Paris white sugar market was also subdued and only 175 lots were traded. Price movements were tight.</p>
<p>May was unchanged at $308.50 and August up 50 cents at $308.40.</p>
