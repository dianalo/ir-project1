<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch call rates ease on ample liquidity- dealers.</title>
<headline>Dutch call rates ease on ample liquidity- dealers.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-06-17</dateline>

<p>Dutch money market rates eased further on Tuesday, with dealers saying market players had realised they had been over-cautious with the new central bank cash reserve arrangement.</p>
<p>Call money changed hands at around 2.875 percent, down some six basis points from Monday.</p>
<p>Deposits running up to three months were also priced lower than yesterday, with three months deposits set at 3.12/20 percent bid/ask, down from 3.14/22 on Monday.</p>
<p>To prepare for economic and monetary union (EMU), the Dutch central bank changed its monetary policy instruments at the end of May.</p>
<p>As a result, banks are no longer allowed to hold a debit balance with the central bank at the end of the day. Any such gap will be automatically filled at the cost of the marginal advance rate, currently pegged at 4.50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There's clearly a problem with the new instruments,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody seems to have ample liquidity left for the nine days we've to go under this cash reserve,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>Call money had risen sharply when they were introduced as market players became accustomed, being wary of having to pay the 4.50 percent rate on possible debits.</p>
<p>One dealer said the lower call rate pulled other short-term deposits down as well, adding that the eased German money market rates had also contributed to this.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a double-edged sword,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Activity was back to normal levels, dealers said, focusing on call money and deposits up to six months.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's Agent closed its Dutch Treasury Certificates (DTCs) programme for July, after business had been done at 3.08 percent on Monday, one dealer said.</p>
<p>The DTC maturing in August was set at 3.09 percent, that of December at 3.13 percent. One dealer said there had been primary activity in December DTCs at 3.14 percent, after which the agency lowered its price. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
