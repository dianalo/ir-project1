<p>Barcelona employees have had had to whitewash over grafitti aimed at Barcelona manager Bobby Robson and the club board on the walls of the Camp Nou stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;Robson go home,&quot; read a comment written in English.  The former England coach was also advised to go to an old people's home, and compared to Barcelona zoo's famous albino gorilla 'Snowflake'.</p>
<p>&quot;More Catalans and less trash,&quot; said another piece of the graffiti.</p>
<p>It followed a week in which Barcelona president Jose Luis Nunez openly criticised defender Albert Ferrer for announcing that he had been approached by arch-rivals Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Ferrer had complained that the club was paying foreign players more than those who had come up through the reserve teams.</p>
<p>The arrival of numerous foreigners at Camp Nou has led to the exclusion of local players such as Ferrer, midfielder Albert Celades and brothers Oscar and Roger Garcia.</p>
