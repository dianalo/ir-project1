<p>Sumitomo Corp stepped up its legal action against former chief copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka on Tuesday, alleging he committed fraud in connection with the company's huge copper market losses.</p>
<p>Sumitomo's fraud complaint, filed with Tokyo prosecutors, is likely to ensure that Hamanaka, currently being held on suspicion of forgery, will not be released when the legal limit on his detention in the existing case runs out on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A conviction on fraud charges carries a much more serious penalty than a forgery conviction in Japan.</p>
<p>Hamanaka was the most controversial and influential figure in the world copper market until he was sacked in June for allegedly racking up $2.6 billion in losses from unauthorised trades.</p>
<p>He was arrested on October 22 on suspicion of forgery, a day after the Japanese trading house filed a complaint with Tokyo prosecutors alleging he forged two documents authorising him to engage in certain copper transactions.</p>
<p>In Japan, the filing of such a complaint kicks off the legal process against a person.</p>
<p>Under Japanese law Hamanaka could be detained for up to three weeks after his forgery arrest without an indictment.</p>
<p>That period was due to expire on Tuesday, and without an indictment or the issue of an arrest warrant on new charges, he could apply for release from Tokyo's detention centre.</p>
<p>A source close to the Tokyo prosecutors office said Hamanaka would be served with an arrest warrant for fraud on Wednesday, effectively forestalling his release.</p>
<p>One of Hamanaka's lawyers said the ex-trader could be sentenced for up to 10 years if he is convicted of the fraud alleged in Tuesday's complaint by Sumitomo. A forgery conviction could result in a sentence of up to five years.</p>
<p>Japanese media have reported that an indictment on the forgery charges was also expected very soon.</p>
<p>Sumitomo's latest complaint states that in 1994 Hamanaka fraudulently raised $770 million through a Hong Kong subsidiary of Sumitomo in order to raise funds to cover losses from unauthorised futures deals.</p>
<p>Sumitomo said the funds were raised under the false pretext of purchasing copper warrants and were later repaid to the Hong Kong unit with profits from other off-the-books derivatives trades.</p>
<p>It said these transactions were hidden from the company.</p>
<p>Sumitomo has alleged that Hamanaka incurred a loss of 6.5 billion yen ($58 million) from unauthorised trading in 1985, while subsequent secret deals attempting to erase the losses simply compounded them until they snowballed into a multi-billion-dollar catastrophe.</p>
<p>Sumitomo also said it was in discussions with Tokyo prosecutors about a possible complaint against Hamanaka for breach of trust.</p>
<p>Following Hamanaka's arrest last month, his lawyer said the former copper trader had admitted to committing forgery, although he denied that he manipulated the world copper market or acted for personal gain. ($1=112 yen)</p>
