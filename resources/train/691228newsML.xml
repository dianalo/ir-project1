<p>An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale rocked northeastern Iran on Thursday destroying 15 villages, Iran's official news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>It said the quake destroyed the villages near the towns of Qaen and Birjand, but did not mention any casualties. A Red Crescent official said relief teams had been sent to the area, according to IRNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.  </p>
<p>Tehran Radio had earlier said the quake struck at 12:15 a.m. on Thursday (1945 GMT on Wednesday).</p>
<p>It was the strongest quake to hit the area since May 10 when a force 7.1 earthquake killed more than 1,560 people, injured 2,600, left 50,000 homeless and levelled about 168 villages close to the towns of Qaen and Birjand.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said this week that most of those made homeless were still living in tents near their damaged villages.</p>
<p>Iran has been hit by at least three major earthquakes in the past year as well as scores of tremors and thousands of aftershocks that U.N. officials say have stretched the country's relief supplies to the limit.</p>
