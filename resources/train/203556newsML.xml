<p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Wednesday defended Germany's policy of &quot;critical dialogue&quot; with Iran in the face of calls to adopt a harder line after ugly protests at the German embassy in Tehran.</p>
<p>Kinkel said he believed the Iranian government would continue to protect Germans from protesters angry at a German prosecutor's allegation that Iran ordered the killing of three Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992.</p>
<p>Several parliamentarians expressed reservations about Bonn's policy -- championed by Kinkel as an alternative to the U.S. strategy of isolation -- and said it was time for Germany, Iran's largest trade partner, to apply more pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a bit fed up with getting wonderful pieces of advice which don't actually help us in this situation,&quot; Kinkel told reporters in Bonn.</p>
<p>Around 1,000 hardline Islamic protesters rallied outside the German embassy in Tehran on Tuesday in the third protest during the past week. Protesters have hurled eggs and tomatoes at the compound and branded the embassy a &quot;den of spies&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In a critical situation, there's no sense in losing our heads,&quot; Kinkel said. &quot;On the contrary, we need to keep a cool head and not take decisions which couldn't be justified later.&quot;</p>
<p>Ruprecht Polenz, an expert on Iran and member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in parliament, said it was time for a policy of &quot;active influence&quot; in which Iran would be required to do more to preserve ties with Bonn.</p>
<p>The party's foreign policy spokesman, Karl Lamers, told the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper the current policy had not failed but added: &quot;We must be more insistent with the Iranian government.&quot;</p>
<p>Kinkel said he agreed with Lamers that it might be time to abandon the term &quot;critical dialogue&quot;. But he insisted the policy behind the phrase was correct.</p>
<p>&quot;The words &quot;critical dialogue' have taken on an exaggerated symbolic value.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Critical dialogue in this context means it is certainly better to stay in contact with a country than to break off contact and push that country into a corner, and this is not just German policy but also European policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest tension in relations between Bonn and Tehran was sparked when a German prosecutor accused Iran of ordering the 1992 killings of three Kurdish leaders and their translator in a Berlin restaurant.</p>
<p>Iran, which has denied any involvement in the shootings, appeared to be trying to defuse the row on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a speech the United States and Israel were the state's main enemies and disputes with other countries were secondary.</p>
<p>He did not mention Germany by name but analysts said the speech looked like an attempt to defuse the row with Bonn.</p>
