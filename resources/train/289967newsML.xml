<p>Saudi Arabia projected higher oil prices in its 1997 budget, which economists and officials said remained a conservative estimate of the petrodollars the world's largest oil producer and exporter could earn this year.</p>
<p>An official source in the kingdom said the average price for a typical barrel of Saudi oil was projected at between $16 and $16.50 in the new budget, around two dollars higher than the projected price in the 1996 budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget took the lower case for oil earnings...It is conservative,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We obviously hope the oil prices will remain high, but we cannot base our budget on hopes,&quot; another official told Reuters.</p>
<p>A barrel of Saudi Arabia's six million barrels per day of crude exports on Monday was around $22.50.</p>
<p>The officials said the budget took account of the different types of crude exported from the kingdom and the markets they were sold to, but would not discuss details.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, which produces eight million barrels per day of oil, exports five different types of crude oil to its major markets in the United States, Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>The state-owned Aramco prices the crudes on discounts or premiums to international benchmark crudes depending on the market where the crude is going.</p>
<p>Oil prices, which in 1996 rose to their highest level since the 1990-91 Gulf War, pushed the kingdom's revenues some $12 billion over projections and helped it catch up on arrears accumulating since the war.</p>
<p>It said it paid back 22 billion riyals ($5.9 billion) to suppliers and farmers in 1996, but did not say how much remained to be paid.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget projected a deficit of 17 billion riyals for 1997 -- steady at the actual 1996 deficit, but below the 18.5 billion forecast for 1996. Economists said the stronger oil prices were behind the rise in actual 1996 earnings to 177 billion riyals compared to a forecast 131.5 billion.</p>
<p>Spending for 1997 was projected at 181 billion riyals, below the actual 1996 figure of 194 billion riyals but higher than the 1996 projected spending of 150 billion riyals.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia attributed the rise in actual spending in 1996 partly to the arrears payments, a move that it said had boosted private sector confidence in the economy.</p>
<p>Economists said the new budget was generally steady, but said that rises in forecast spending flew in the face of government statements that it is putting the brakes on spending. They also said the kingdom continued to rely on oil for 75 percent of income, leaving it vulnerable to price fluctuations.</p>
<p>&quot;The government says it wants to eliminate the gap between spending and revenue by the end of the century, but if spending keeps going up they will have real difficulties achieving that,&quot; one economist based in the kingdom said.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia appears serious in diversifying its economy, giving the private sector a bigger role and employing more nationals in the expatriate-dominated workforce, the economists said.</p>
<p>But the wheels of reform remain slow, they added.</p>
