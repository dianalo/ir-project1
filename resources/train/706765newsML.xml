<p>Indonesian pepper prices sizzled their way to a record high on Thursday, buoyed by a production shortfall due to bad weather and good demand, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The sore point, however, is there's not much pepper to sell at the moment,&quot; one trader lamented. &quot;Prices are high, the demand is good but supply has been very tight.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said prices were expected to sustain their upward momentum through the end of the year because the 1997 crop was expected to be some 20 percent lower than 1996 production.</p>
<p>The inter-governmental International Pepper Community (IPC) had revised downwards its production forecast on Indonesia to 38,000 tonnes in 1997 from 39,200 tonnes in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;I see pepper production this year coming in at 32,000 tonnes at best,&quot; a senior trader said. &quot;Some players are forecasting a production of some 30,000 tonnes.&quot;</p>
<p>The traders said prices of the condiment had jumped to 8,500 rupiah ($3.47) a kg from 7,200 rupiah ($2.94) a month ago and 2,650 rupiah ($1.08) a year ago. Local prices peaked at 8,000 rupiah ($3.26) in 1989.</p>
<p>The export price was quoted at $4,200 a tonne, up from $3,850 last month and $2,700 last year.</p>
<p>Indonesia is the world's top pepper producer after India and the two are grouped under the IPC along with such key producers as Brazil, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The combined production of the six nations had been forecast by the IPC at 146,563 tonnes in 1997, down from 147,785 tonnes last year and 161,674 in 1995. Production in non-member Vietnam has been pegged at 20,000 tonnes, unchanged over the last three years.</p>
<p>The traders said the Indonesian pepper harvest began in March instead of the usual June, but added that arrivals have only been trickling in so far.</p>
<p>&quot;The harvest seems to have started earlier this year, but there has not been much pepper flowing in,&quot; one trader who recently visited a key growing region on Banka Island off Sumatra said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fame's there are disappointed because of the poor crop,&quot; he said. &quot;The harvest usually peaks in August, but this time around I think we are going to see flat production.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the production shortfall was due to a streaky weather pattern earlier this year, when it rained intermittently affecting the flowering and fruiting process.</p>
<p>The trader, however, said it could not be determined if the erratic weather was due to the El Nino weather pattern gaining momentum in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>International scientists have warned that a major El Nino was occurring with the potential of causing billions of dollars of damage in key agricultural regions world-wide.</p>
<p>The El Nino phenomenon has already caused jitters in the New York cocoa market as it has the potential to cause droughts. Indonesian coffee exporters have said production was expected to plunge this year due to bad weather.</p>
<p>&quot;It could be...it could not be linked to El Nino,&quot; the trader said if asked if the expected fall in pepper production could be linked to the weather pattern. &quot;We just don't know yet.&quot;</p>
