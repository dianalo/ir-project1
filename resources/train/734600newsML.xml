<p>The German federal government ran up a cash deficit of 50.5 billion marks in the 1997 first half, about 12.5 billion marks higher than in the 1996 period, the Bundesbank said in its monthly report for July.</p>
<p>The German central bank said the cash deficit in June, which it termed &quot;a big tax month&quot; due to quarterly tax payments, narrowed by about 2.5 billion marks but failed to offset the weak position at the start of the year.</p>
<p>In June itself, the cash deficit was &quot;a good 1/2 billion marks&quot;, despite the high tax inflows, it said.</p>
<p>The report said cash inflows during the period from January to June rose 6.5 percent but that outgoing payments rose almost 10 percent.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank also said net borrowing by German federal, regional and local authorities in the first five months of 1997 rose about 25.5 billion marks to 63 billion marks.</p>
<p>The report said that as in previous months the federal government was the top borrower in capital markets with an increase of a net 11 billion marks in May and 14-1/2 billion marks in June.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank figures on cash deficit refer only to payments and withdrawals from government accounts with the German central bank.</p>
<p>The figures differ from the government's fiscal statistics because they record transactions as and when they are made rather than when they are included in the government budget.</p>
<p>They also include transactions for the European Union which are not registered in the budget.</p>
