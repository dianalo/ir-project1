<p>Fletcher Energy shares jumped sharply on Thursday after news it would develop a gas condesate field in Brunei.</p>
<p>Its shares rose 24 cents to NZ$4.15 before easing back to $4.05. Volume was a solid 724,300.</p>
<p>Earlier, Fletcher announced it and its partners would proceed with the US$230 million development of the Maharaja Lela gas condensate field, offshore from Brunei.  </p>
<p>Tests from Maharaja Lela 3 appraisal well earlier this year indicated a number of reservoir sequences and produced 29 million standard cubic feet (mmscf) of gas and 444 barrels of condensate per day on test.</p>
<p>&quot;Analysts probably haven't included any of the Maharaja Lela in their assessments of valuation. The market had completely discounted Brunei,&quot; said an energy specialist with an Auckland brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;They desperately needed a new project and it indicates their persistence in being a player in Brunei,&quot; said HSBC James Capel senior energy analyst Mario Traviati.  </p>
<p>He said the market had been sceptical about Brunei because it had been a &quot;closed shop&quot; for so long.</p>
<p>&quot;It's had a handful of major companies operating there and it's been very difficult for anyone else to become a major player in that country.</p>
<p>&quot;This represents an important step for Brunei and for Fletchers,&quot; Traviati said.</p>
<p>Recent drilling reports from Brunei had disappointed the market.  </p>
<p>The Auckland specialist said that the important aspect of the Maharaja gas field was that a contract had been agreed to pipe the gas into the Shell pipeline to a LNG facility owned by Shell, the Brunei government and Mitsubishi. The LNG will be then sold to Japan at prices linked to Japanese oil prices.</p>
<p>Development costs were slightly lower than origninally expected, he said.</p>
<p>He said Fletcher already had reserves of around 400 million barells of oil equivalent and this field would add around 27 million, so the field was not large in the greater scheme.  </p>
<p>&quot;However, it is the first of the projects they have got going in Brunei so it is more of a credibility thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Having moved 20 cents aleady I suspect nothing much more will happen from here. It's a one-off adjustment.&quot;</p>
<p>Traviati said he had little doubt that once Fletcher had begun operations in Brunei, it would expand.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very important to get infrastructure,&quot; he said. &quot;This also puts Fletcher in the LNG business, effectively.&quot;</p>
