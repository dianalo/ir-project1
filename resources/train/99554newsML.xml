<p>North Korea has no intention of invading South Korean islands or other territory, a diplomat at the North Korean embassy in Moscow told Russia's RIA news agency on Monday.</p>
<p>Officials at the embassy were not available to confirm the report, which added that North Korea's stated determination to retaliate for the deaths of more than 20 of its soldiers who ran aground in the south aboard a submarine &quot;in no way means a threat of invasion&quot;.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has threatened &quot;merciless retaliation&quot; for the incident last month.</p>
<p>RIA, quoting the North Korean diplomat, said: &quot;North Korea has no intention of invading South Korean islands, and Seoul's assertions on this are completely unfounded.&quot;</p>
<p>South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung warned on Friday of North Korean action against a group of isolated islands which are situated close to the 38th parallel that is roughly the line of division between North and South Korea.</p>
<p>The government in Seoul, which has long feared that North Korea might make a lunge for the islands, has stepped up security in a climate of increasing tension.</p>
<p>Pyongyang's relations with Moscow are not as close as they were in the Soviet era but Russia remains a favoured partner and North Korea occasionally uses its Moscow embassy as a channel for official statements.</p>
