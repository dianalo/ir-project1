<title>ITALY: Versace predicted end of &quot;heroin chic&quot; - interview.</title>
<headline>Versace predicted end of &quot;heroin chic&quot; - interview.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-07-17</dateline>

<p>&quot;Heroin chic&quot; has had its day and the time has come to rediscover beauty and decorum, Italian designer Gianni Versace said in an interview the day before he was shot dead in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>&quot;Fashion stolen from the streets has come full circle, just like youth tribes and their rites,&quot; he told Italian news magazine Panorama in an interview to be published on Friday. &quot;Now it's time to teach people how to dress.</p>
<p>&quot;Above all, the 'heroin chic' fashion is over, not only in the collections but in the public imagination,&quot; he said, referring to the recent controversial trend of showing models looking pale and haggard as if under the influence of drugs.</p>
<p>Versace, an innovative stylist often accused of sacrificing classical decorum in favour of shocking or vulgar designs, including those inspired by the punk movement of the 1970s, was shot dead on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Versace said contemporary art had given fashion new standards of beauty for the body and clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;There'll be a return to quality,&quot; he said. &quot;The great photographers will turn to fashion and with them there'll be a greater respect between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to teach people to be themselves, to rediscover beauty and decorum.&quot;</p>
<p>Versace's murder sent shock-waves through Italy's multi-million dollar fashion industry. Police have mounted a massive manhunt for Andrew Cunanan, a 27-year-old homosexual prostitute whom they described as their only suspect.</p>
<p>A Miami funeral home said on Thursday that Versace had been cremated and his ashes would be taken home by members of his family, who were leaving on a private jet for Italy.</p>
<p>Versace's sister and brother, who were his business partners, earlier expressed their gratitude for the support they had received since their brother's death.</p>
<p>&quot;Donatella Versace, Santo Versace and the family have been deeply moved by the support coming from around the world for our beloved Gianni -- from friends, colleagues, the press and above all the people that Gianni never personally met but still honoured him,&quot; they said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We would wish to express our thanks for respecting our private lives in this time of our sorrow.&quot;</p>
