<p>Against a background of constant bloodshed, the Algerian government freed Abassi Madani, leader of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), in a move seen as reflecting the authorities' confidence ahead of new local elections.</p>
<p>Diplomats said they did not expect Madani's release to end the violence, questioning how much sway he had with armed Moslem fundamentalists whom officials blame for the killings.</p>
<p>But it could help forge consensus with the legal opposition and cut some of the ground from under hardline Islanmists. It also showed the authorities' confidence in pursuing a path of political reform decided by President Liamine Zeroual, they said.</p>
<p>The outlawed FIS leadership in Europe said the move was a &quot;definite and effective contribution to solving the crisis and returning to peace and stability&quot; in the country where 60,000 people have died in nearly six years of conflict.</p>
<p>Algeria last month completed its first multi-party general election since one dominated by the FIS in December 1991 was cancelled in January 1992, sparking an outbreak of violence.</p>
<p>The outlawed FIS was barred from running but two moderate Islamist parties were allowed to compete and seven members of one have since joined the coalition government.</p>
<p>Hours after Madani walked to freedom on Tuesday after serving less than half his 12-year jail term, Zeroual met party leaders to discuss a date for local elections promised this year.</p>
<p>This ballot is seen as as final step in rebuilding Algeria's state institutions.</p>
<p>In an editorial on Tuesday perhaps foreshadowing Madani's release, the government newspaper El Moudjahid said Zeroual &quot;needs the total support of the political class and all Algerians&quot; in his objective of &quot;rebuilding the country and ending the cycle of violence for which Algerian society is paying a high price&quot;.</p>
<p>Only hours before the FIS chief's release, a bomb killed at least 21 people and wounded scores in Algiers and influential newspapers reported further massacres over the weekend and on Monday night in which around 60 people died.</p>
<p>&quot;The FIS's AIS (Islamic Salvation Army) is only one of six or seven groups and is not going to stop fighting until the FIS is legalised,&quot; said Martin Stone, head of research at London-based Control Risks.</p>
<p>&quot;And the GIA has nothing to do with the FIS and it's that group which is doing the urban bombings like that yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>The Armed Islamic Group (GIA), led by Antar Zouabri, 27, is the most ruthless of the groups and is blamed by the authorities for bombing and massacres in which hundreds have died.</p>
<p>There was no sign that the Algerian authorities planned to change the status of Madani's outlawed party, whose exiled leadership in Europe while welcoming his release also called for that of his deputy Ali Belhadj and all &quot;political prisoners&quot;.</p>
<p>Algerian state-controlled radio and television, after briefly reading the official statement of Madani's &quot;release on parole&quot;, avoided any further comment.</p>
<p>Madani, 66, was jailed in 1992 for threatening state security after a strike and riots preceded Algeria's multi-party general election planned for June 1991.</p>
<p>In the unrest, at the height of the FIS's domination of city streets in June, he said: &quot;If the army does not withdraw we will be obliged to call a jihad (holy struggle).&quot;</p>
<p>Two days later, he and Belhadj were arrested. The poll was put off to December 1991. After the FIS took a huge lead, the authorities cancelled the results and a planned second round.</p>
<p>Madani and Belhadj were tried and sentenced by a military court.</p>
