<p>A global co-ordinator should be appointed to ensure the smooth flow of information about globally active financial institutions and reduce market risk, a study by Group of Seven finance ministers said.</p>
<p>The draft report, to be presented to G7 leaders on Saturday at their summit here, tackled how to be sure financial stability was maintained in a global market place where problems in one area could quickly destabilize other regions.</p>
<p>Incidents such as the 1994 slide of the Mexican peso and high-profile derivatives losses have triggered concern about connections between markets and the prospects for prices or banks collapsing in response to a major shock.</p>
<p>Looking at ways to enhance cooperation, encourage risk management and transparency and adopt high prudential standards in emerging economies, the report made proposals to increase the transparency of markets and their participants.</p>
<p>&quot;International financial markets are undergoing rapid changes, leading to increased expansion, globalization and complexity,&quot; said the report, drawn up by the ministers together with international regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>These changes presented new opportunities that could lead to increased efficiency in the international financial system but also presented risks to consumers, investors and the markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Governments must take measures to deal effectively with possible systemic or contagion risks and foster stability without stifling innovation or undermining the benefits of liberalization and competition,&quot; said the draft text obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>But it warned that market regulation must be implemented systematically to avoid different market standards which could lead to &quot;regulatory arbitrage&quot;.</p>
<p>The draft said the finance ministers and regulators agreed a coordinator should be identified &quot;to facilitate the exchange of information on globally-active financial institutions&quot;.</p>
<p>More public disclosure of information was another important tool to reduce market risk.</p>
<p>&quot;A stable financial system depends on sound financial institutions, whose operations are transparent to supervisors and the market,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The report called on the global network of regulatory bodies which makes up the Joint Forum to study the need for further legal steps to ensure timely information publication.</p>
<p>Turning specifically to emerging economies, the paper called on the International Monetary Fund to take greater account of financial sector stability in its surveillance work.</p>
<p>Stressing the need for national governments to take ultimate reponsibility for sound ecnomic policies, the paper called on the IMF and World Bank, together with the international regulatory bodies, to report on the roles they play in strengthening emerging economies by next April.</p>
