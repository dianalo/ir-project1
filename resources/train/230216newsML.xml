<p>Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.  reached an agreement Tuesday to collaborate on future Boeing wide-body commercial airplane programs.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the aerospace companies said the first project McDonnell Douglas will work on is the development of new versions of the Boeing 747 jumbo jet.</p>
<p>The move comes as Boeing faces record orders for its commercial aircraft and McDonnell Douglas is looking for ways to keep its employees working.</p>
<p>&quot;(This) allows us to keep our skilled teams together at a period when we have minimal commercial development activity underway,&quot; said Tom Downey, spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas. He added that the deal will allow the company to remain on the cutting edge of airplane design.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at a long-term colloborative, strategic arrangement for wide-bodies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wall Street viewed the deal as a positive for both companies, allowing Boeing to meet its ever-growing backlog while giving ailing McDonnell Douglas time to assess its options.</p>
<p>&quot;It's looks like a good deal for Boeing because they get the extra capacity, and for McDonnell it raises the issue (of) 'What's going to become of that commercial business? Do they become a potential takeover?',&quot; said Cai Von Rumohr, analyst at Cowen &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Von Rumohr said McDonnell may seek a more permanent partnership either with Boeing, Europe's Airbus Industrie or an Asian company, or it could opt to carve out a niche as a preferred sub-contractor.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas has looked directionless in recent months. In November it lost a lucrative bid to build a next-generation fighter plane for the Pentagon.</p>
<p>In October, the company shelved plans to build the MD-XX, a long-range commercial aircraft aimed at competing with the 747. That decision effectively ended the company's ambitions of competing with Boeing and Airbus as a full-fledged commercial airplane manufacturer.</p>
<p>&quot;Their position as a mainstream player is not as strong as it has been,&quot; Von Romohr said. &quot;This has happened gradually over time. The decision not to go ahead with the MD-XX in essence opened up the potential to take on this role with Boeing.&quot;</p>
<p>Boeing said it was looking forward to working closely with McDonnell Douglas.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a record number of orders for commercial jets and several ongoing development programs,&quot; said Ron Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. &quot;McDonnell Douglas has excellent design and production capability -- both in people and facilities -- that are not being fully utilized.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to applying those resources to future Boeing wide-body airplane programs in a way that is a win-win for both of us.&quot;</p>
<p>Boeing said initially the agreement was expected to bring several hundred McDonnell Douglas employees to Seattle in January to begin assisting with engineering design and analysis on the 747-500X/-600X.</p>
<p>The agreement should be finalized in January.</p>
<p>McDonnell's stock was unchanged at $52.625 and Boeing slipped 12.5 cents to $97.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
