<p>The IRA's decision to declare a new ceasefire in its battle against British rule of Northern Ireland will bear further political fruit on Friday at a meeting in Dublin.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern is due to hold talks with Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's legal political arm, in a further sign of its acceptance.</p>
<p>It will be the first time Adams has met an Irish prime minister since the IRA broke its last ceasefire in February 1996 with a huge bomb in London that killed two people.</p>
<p>Ahern, who met Sinn Fein officials while he was in opposition, succeeded John Bruton after elections in the Irish republic in June.</p>
<p>John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, was also expected to attend the Dublin meeting, officials said.</p>
<p>Since the IRA declared its new ceasefire last weekend, Sinn Fein has been told it can join Belfast talks in September on the political future of Northern Ireland if the truce is judged to be genuine.</p>
<p>The peace talks, intended to find an end to three decades of strife between Protestants and Catholics that have cost 3,200 lives, ran into trouble on Wednesday when Protestant unionist parties voted down Anglo-Irish proposals for disarming guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>The unionists, guardians of continued British rule, rejected the plan because it would have allowed Sinn Fein to take part in the talks before the IRA surrendered any of its guns and bombs.</p>
<p>Two small unionists parties walked out of the talks for good after the vote and the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party said it would not negotiate with Sinn Fein while its IRA allies remained armed.</p>
<p>The unionists fear that the IRA, one of the world's best-armed and most experienced guerrilla organisations, will return to violence unless the talks lead to its goal of a united Ireland.</p>
<p>Adams called on the British and Irish governments, co-sponsors of the peace talks, to ensure that substantive negotiations involving Sinn Fein began on schedule on September 15.</p>
<p>&quot;The unionist refusal to engage at this time cannot be allowed to dictate the pace of progress,&quot; Adams said in a statement. &quot;Sinn Fein does not want to see any empty seats at the negotiating table. However no one can be allowed a veto.&quot;</p>
<p>The fragility of peace efforts following the IRA ceasefire was underlined when a parcel bomb filled with ball-bearings was sent to a prominent Protestant political leader in Belfast.</p>
<p>Police said the device sent to Robert McCartney, leader of the small pro-British UK Unionist Party which has walked out of the peace talks, on Thursday was &quot;crude but viable.&quot; It was made safe by army experts.</p>
<p>McCartney, who is on holiday abroad, told BBC radio: &quot;The parcel, if opened, would probably have been fatal or at the very least would have caused very disfiguring injuries.&quot;</p>
<p>Adam Ingram, Britain's Northern Ireland security minister, said the parcel bomb was a matter of regret but he did not think it represented a breach of the IRA ceasefire.</p>
