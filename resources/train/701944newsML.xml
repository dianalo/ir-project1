<title>MALAYSIA: KL shares end up on local institutional buying.</title>
<headline>KL shares end up on local institutional buying.</headline>

<p>Malaysian shares ignored a devaluation of the Thai baht to end up on fresh support from local institutions, dealers and analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said buying was selective, but it showed fresh signs of confidence in the local stock market, which has been in the doldrums since the beginning of April.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Composite Index ended up 5.98 points to 1,084.88. The second board shares index was up 3.64 to 566.48.</p>
<p>&quot;There was fairly strong institutional as well as retail sentiment, mainly local,&quot; said Jonathan Duckett, an institutional dealer with Mohaiyani Securities.  </p>
<p>He said buying was selective and foreign participation was not visible. &quot;But, there were some initial signs of some positive sentiment (returning),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Volume rose to 321.39 million shares against 204 million on Tuesday. Gainers led losers 394 to 217 with 158 shares unchanged and 113 untraded.</p>
<p>Among index heavyweights, Maybank gained 50 cents to 7.0 ringgit on expectations of interest rate increases and better results for the year to June 30, but Telekom was unchanged at 12.20 ringgit. Sime Darby rose 20 cents to 8.5 ringgit, but Tenaga was steady at 12.3.</p>
<p>&quot;In a sense the market has already factored in the Thai crisis (over last few months) and the money supply numbers show the perceived liquidity problem is not huge,&quot; said Phua Lee Kerk, head of research at Jupiter Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being, we are quite immune to the Thai problems,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thailand announced that it was allowing the baht to float.</p>
<p>Malaysia's central bank said broad money M3 expanded by 20.1 percent year-on-year in May against 19.7 in April. End-May annual loans grew 29.5 percent from 28.5 at end-April.</p>
<p>&quot;The money supply figures may not be that encouraging, but it is fair to say it is well under control,&quot; Phua said.</p>
<p>J.M. Sassoon's chief economist Liew Yin Sze said lending growth has to slow further if the expansion in money supply was to be further curbed. &quot;If lending growth doesn't slow down, eventually money supply will grow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Thailand to me is a buy situation. Malaysia has not come down far enough,&quot; Liew added.</p>
