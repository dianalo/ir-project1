<p>Brazil's insurance market will grow at impressive rates over the next few years thanks to the nation's successful anti-inflation drive, which has boosted demand for life, pension and health plans, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The sector is expected to grow 15 percent annualy over the next five years, with premiums reaching $30 billion in 2001, or four percent of (gross domestic product),&quot; said Antonio Carlos Pereira de Almeida, president of Sao Paulo state's association of insurance firms.  </p>
<p>Currently, the insurance sector accounts for 2.6 percent of Brazil's GDP, or $14 billion, up from 1.3 percent in 1993, according to Brazil's National Federation of Insurance Companies (Fenaseg).</p>
<p>Last year, car insurance accounted for 35.8 percent of the total premiums and life, pension and health insurance plans accounted for 32.3 percent, Fenaseg said.</p>
<p>Most of the optimism for future growth is attributed to Brazil's ongoing stabilization drive, which has cut monthly inflation rates to one percent in 1996 from 50 percent in the first half of 1994.  </p>
<p>&quot;Now Brazilians can make plans for the medium- and long-term,&quot; said Toni Lotar, director of  Sul America Previdencia, one of three Brazilian insurers which recently launched a private pension plan for individuals.</p>
<p>Growth prospects for life, pension and health plans are also based on a growing feeling among Brazilians that the government can not provide adequate health services or pension plans.  </p>
<p>Sul America, for example, offers a pension plan to Brazilians with a minimum annual income of 19,500 reais ($19,121). This income group is likely to see its standard of living decline dramatically if it relies only on the government's current pension plan, Lotar said.</p>
<p>Increasing demand for insurance products will also change the face of Brazil's insurance industry, creating more competition and forcing insurers to merge or raise capital in the near-term.  </p>
<p>&quot;Insurers will have to join partnerships or raise capital in the next few years to be able to cover the higher demand which brings a higher volume of risks,&quot; said Marcio Coriollano, superintendant of Brazil's Susep, a private institution responsible for supervising Brazilian insurance firms.</p>
<p>Foreign firms participating in Brazil's insurance sector now number 24 out of a total of 120. Foreign interest is expected to grow further following the lifting in June of a ban on private participation in the nation's reinsurance market.  </p>
<p>Swiss Reinsurance Co opened an office in Brazil last month to conduct market studies and others are expected to follow.</p>
<p>However, the amount of foreign participation in Brazil's reinsurance market depends on the content of a bill that would regulate the reinsurance sector. Analysts expect the bill to be ready for Congressional vote by mid-1997.</p>
