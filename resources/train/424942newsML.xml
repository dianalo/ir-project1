<p>Turkish shares jumped over eight percent in active Thursday morning trade, reclaiming much of the territory lost earlier this week on hopes that a row between the military and the Islamist-led government had been put to rest.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 index rose 8.45 percent, or 116 points, to end the morning session at 1,488 after plummeting 14.9 percent in the last three days.</p>
<p>Trading volume tripled to 23.6 trillion lira ($190 million) from 8.39 trillion on Wednesday morning in a sudden return of market confidence precipitated by a conciliatory gesture from Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to the armed forces, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said he calmed a six-day dispute with the National Security Council (NSC) by signing its weekend statement aimed at quelling a rise in Islamist activism since Erbakan's coalition with pro-Western former prime minister Tansu Ciller came to power eight months ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The market moved very quickly at the opening. Erbakan's signing of the NSC decisions had a considerably positive impact on the market,&quot; said Hasan Soydan of Garanti Securities.</p>
<p>In the short term, there remained potential for more gains and brokers said the index might close above 1,500 points on Thursday depending on the strength of any profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be some profit-taking and later the index might see 1,550,&quot; said Sevim Ozyurt, analyst from Yatirim Arastirma research company.</p>
<p>The bond market was also buoyed by the news and bond yields fell seven to eight percentage points to 100-102 percent, erasing part of a 15 percentage point rise since Monday morning. The lira weakened further on underlying dollar strength to 124,320 from a close of 124,070 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Domestic investors were dominating the shares market, which tumbled earlier in the week on fears the military warning would jeopardise both the future of the government and its bold plans for the economy, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The movement has been driven mainly by the domestic market, which realised it was oversold as there were not many changes in the economic situation,&quot; said Can Akcay, chief trader for institutional sales at leading Istanbul brokerage Global Securities.</p>
<p>Newly found market faith in the government's ability to accelerate a sluggish privatisation programme and bring some stability to public finances had this year added 65 percent to the lira value of Istanbul shares by Friday's close.</p>
<p>The government's aim of balancing the 1997 budget includes a target of $5 billion in sell-off revenues.</p>
<p>However, higher-than-expected February inflation of just under 80 percent announced this week disappointed some hopes about the speed of progress in strengthening the economy, dealers said.</p>
<p>The risk of a further slide in shares on renewed political uncertainty hung over the market despite expectations that the military-Islamist row was defused.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to wait and see what happens. An hour is a long time in Turkish politics,&quot; Global's Akcay said. Newspapers said on Thursday the government planned to ask parliament to debate the security council statement.</p>
<p>Haldun Sertel of Can Securities said the buying spree might be only a short-term reaction to the earlier sell-off and said there was a risk of selling by foreign investors on concern about the situation in Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreigners could move to sell at any moment. The European Union's negative thoughts about Turkey are going to exert an influence over the market in the time to come,&quot; Sertel said. Leading European Union politicians spoke out this week against Turkey's membership of the European grouping.</p>
