<p>Bosnian Serb leaders have withdrawn their support for economic legislation considered crucial to rebuilding Bosnia and raising reconstruction aid, diplomats said on Monday.</p>
<p>Only weeks after agreeing on draft laws for customs rates and the formation of a central bank, Serb leaders raised fresh objections about the legislation which threatened to paralyse the inter-ethnic government, diplomats said.</p>
<p>&quot;The leadership decided it couldn't accept some elements of the legislation,&quot; said a Western diplomat, who asked not to be named. &quot;They've gone back on the agreements.&quot;</p>
<p>Indicted war criminal and former Bosnian Serb president, Radovan Karadzic, was believed to have participated in the decision to renege on the agreements, diplomats said.</p>
<p>By reneging on agreements for economic laws the Serbs were risking losing out on significant reconstruction aid to be raised at an international donors' conference this month, the office of the international community's High Representative to Bosnia said.</p>
<p>Adoption of the economic legislation was supposed to be a precondition for holding the donors' conference in Brussels.</p>
<p>Ambassadors from countries including the United States, Germany, Britain, France and Russia planned to hold talks on Monday evening with Serb leaders in their government seat of Pale to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Now is the time to make clear to leaders in Pale what is at stake,&quot; Michael Steiner, deputy High Representative, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The international community has made it clear that the flow of financial aid is dependent on fulfilling the commitments.&quot;</p>
<p>The crisis surrounding the economic laws not only illustrated the joint government's state of paralysis but also cast doubt on whether threats to withhold financial aid had any effect on the Serb leadership, diplomats said.</p>
<p>At a summit in Sintra, Portugal 10 days ago, the United States and European powers vowed to make reconstruction aid conditional on compliance with the 1995 Dayton peace accords which ended the Bosnian conflict.</p>
<p>But Serb ministers last week withdrew support for a harmonisation of custom rates between the country's Moslem-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic. They said the law did not conform to an agreement on mutual cooperation with neighbouring Yugoslavia, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Western governments say the cooperation pact between Bosnia's Serb Republic and Yugoslavia is a clear violation of the Dayton agreement as it was negotiated without consultation with Moslem and Croat partners in the Bosnian government.</p>
<p>Even Yugoslav officials say the pact has no legal validity unless the Bosnian joint parliament approves it.</p>
<p>&quot;They are using an unconstitutional agreement as a reason for backtracking on the customs law,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
<p>The Serb member of the collective presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, has also refused to sign an agreement on a draft central bank law drawn up by U.S. mediators. His Moslem and Croat counterparts have signed the agreement.</p>
<p>It was unclear why the Serbs had withdrawn their support for a draft central bank law, which allows Serb authorities to use currency from Yugoslavia in official transactions for an indefinite period.</p>
<p>Talks over the proposed central bank had dragged on for months until U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard announced an agreement on the draft law shortly before the Portugal summit, hailing it as a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Bosnia's new central government, comprised of a joint presidency, cabinet and parliament, is supposed to rule over autonomous Serb and Moslem-Croat territories.</p>
<p>Moslem, Croat and Serb representatives were locked in stalemate until last month, when international pressure at last produced the tentative agreements on a central bank, a harmonisation of customs rates and a state budget law.</p>
