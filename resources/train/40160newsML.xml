<p>The Indian tea industry is shifting to packaged tea from the traditional loose variety in response to changing demand, traders and growers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Total tea output rose to 754 million kg in 1995, up 4.7 percent from 720 million kg in 1990, officials with the state-run Tea Board said.</p>
<p>Over the same five-year period, production of packaged tea surged 20 percent to 300 million kg from 250 million.</p>
<p>Domestic consumption of loose tea jumped 48 percent to 377 million kg in 1995, up from 255 million kg in 1980, a Tea Board official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Packet tea consumption has grown by a whopping 140 percent from 91 million kilos to 218 million kilos during the same period,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Traders said more than three quarters of exports are currently in value-added forms like tea packets and tea bags.</p>
<p>&quot;Even when we export in loose form, the importers package them and brand them with their own trademarks. Instead of losing our identity we can brand them ourselves,&quot; tea exporter Nandakumar (eds: one name) said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the domestic market, quality consciousness is picking up. Packet tea is believed to be more hygienic than loose tea, where there is a chance of dust contamination,&quot; said dealer Ramachandra Nair.</p>
<p>Traders said packet tea was more profitable than loose categories as consumers were becoming increasingly brand loyal.</p>
<p>&quot;Urbanisation and modernisation affect consumer preferences. Loose tea consumption is disappearing fast,&quot; said consumer activist B. Haldurai.</p>
<p>Brooke Bond India Ltd, with its 17 brands, accounts for 60 percent of the domestic packaged tea market. The company spends nearly 600 million rupees a year on marketing its different brands, both overseas and abroad.</p>
<p>Tata Tea Ltd accounts for 25 percent of the domestic market and Duncans 10 percent.</p>
<p>Packet tea was exempted from the Tea Marketing Control Order (TMCO) of 1984. The order, promulgated under the Tea Act of 1953, requires all manufacturers to sell 75 percent of their production through public auction.</p>
<p>Exports of packet tea are also exempted from the control order.</p>
<p>&quot;This order itself is irrelevant in today's liberalisation era. As long as it stands, the only way to get out of this is to go for packet teas,&quot; said Bhoja Rajan, former chairman of the Coonoor Tea Trade Association.</p>
