<title>GERMANY: German metal employers fail to cut sick pay costs.</title>
<headline>German metal employers fail to cut sick pay costs.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>

<p>Germany's largest metal and engineering employers signed 1997 wage agreements Wednesday that failed to take advantage of a new law allowing them to make deep cuts in employees' sick pay.</p>
<p>The industry back-down, following fierce protests by hundreds of thousands of workers over the past two months, means that the cuts in labour costs that industry leaders have sought for years will be postponed yet again.</p>
<p>Negotiators in the large steel-making region of North Rhine-Westphalia said Wednesday they had reached a wage deal guaranteeing continued full sick pay for the 850,000 metal workers in the region, the largest in a sector employing a total 3.2 million workers.</p>
<p>North Rhine-Westphalia is home to German steel giants Thyssen AG and Krupp-Hoesch Stahl.</p>
<p>The accord came as employers in the southern part of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to companies such as Daimler Benz AG's car-making unit Mercedes Benz, said they had signed a similar pact with some 300,000 workers there.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Bavaria, where some 650,000 workers are employed, union leaders said they were confident of reaching a deal that would maintain sick pay and warned of renewed industrial action if employers did not make acceptable offers.</p>
<p>The newly-signed packages were based on a breakthrough deal signed last week in the northern state of Lower Saxony that guaranteed full sick pay and a 1.5 percent rise in 1997 followed by a 2.5 percent increase in 1998.</p>
<p>In return, employers demanded a five percentage point cut to workers' traditionally generous Christmas bonuses to 55 percent of a month's salary, making the overall rise in labour costs next year less than 1 percent.</p>
