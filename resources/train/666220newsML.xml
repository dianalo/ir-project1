<p>Tanzania unveils its 1997/87 budget on Thursday with the government of east Africa's poorest nation determined to carry out long-awaited tax reforms.</p>
<p>Western donors, who underwrite annual lifeblood aid to Tanzania, have long pushed successive governments to tackle the tax issue and a create an investment climate in the once-socialist state.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Daniel Yona told Reuters in March that he intends to do just that. Yona pledged a &quot;taxpayer and investor friendly budget&quot; and there have been signs that he intends to keep his promise.</p>
<p>Excessive bureaucracy and inequitable tax rates are two of the most common complaints made by the local business community.</p>
<p>A tax task force appointed by President Benjamin Mkapa late last year to investigate their grievances has presented its findings and recommended changes, specifically to sales tax rates and import duty.</p>
<p>Tanzania's agricultural economy is characterised by low savings, a narrow tax base and an over-dependency on imports for its most basic needs. The contribution of manufacturing to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is between five and seven percent.</p>
<p>Financial analysts say in addition to tax reform the budget would have announce measures to tackle other economic woes inhibiting investment such as infrastructural deficiencies including power and water shortages, poor transport and communications.</p>
<p>Education, social services and public health are also vastly underfunded. Despite three decades of massive donor aid, mainly from Scandinavian countries, the capital Dar es Salaam still has no reliable water supply.</p>
<p>Tanzania has won applause from donors and international financial institutions for adhering to an unpopular regime of tight fiscal discipline which will result in a budget surplus this year.</p>
<p>Tanzania abandoned socialist policies in the late 1980s and early 1990s to embark on a free market avenue in line with agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.</p>
<p>The government is on target with revenue collection. By May this year more than 515 billion shillings ($831.4 million) had been collected against the 570 billion targetted forthe year 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;They've been very good on revenue collection. Their performance up to May shows they are on target,&quot; said one western diplomat, adding a &quot;solid revenue base&quot; was an absolute prerequisite for the the introduction of a Value Added Tax (VAT) scheduled for July, 1998.</p>
<p>Other positive signs that Tanzania's economy is on the mend include a falling inflation rate and a slowly rising GDP.</p>
<p>Excluding the effects of drought, year-to-year inflation is running at about 13.2 percent compared to 24 percent for the same period last year. Annual GDP growth is about 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;What we're hoping for is a consolidation budget. The government is on the right track,&quot; said Festus Osunsade, IMF senior representative to Tanzania.</p>
<p>The IMF expects Tanzania's government and state-owned firms to cut borrowing from commercial banks, increase fiscal and monetary discipline and push ahead with reforms in the economy.</p>
<p>Reforms, including ending the state monopoly in banking and allowing in foreign banks, ending state firms' subsidies and liberalising foreign exchange, were introduced after founding president Julius Nyerere, stepped down from power in 1985.</p>
<p>Economic analysts say Nyerere's socialist experiments reduced Tanzania to the poorest nation outside a war zone.</p>
<p>Donors also expect Yona to cut Tanzania's bloated civil service of some 200,000 people for a population of about 27 million. No government in Tanzania has managed to handle the highly sensitive issue.</p>
