<p>Manchester United's fluent triumph over Tottenham on Sunday and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's two superb goals have presented manager Alex Ferguson with the happiest of problems.</p>
<p>&quot;It's something of a nightmare for me to pick a team now,&quot; he admitted after his side's 2-0 win. &quot;I've got so many good players for so many positions and the team has so many options.</p>
<p>&quot;But Ole's goals means he picks himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Solskjaer's majestic double-strike took his tally to five goals from eight appearances for United and helped lift the defending champions to third in the league, four points behind arch-rivals and leaders Liverpool, who travel to Old Trafford on October 12.</p>
<p>Consider that four of those eight appearances have been as a substitute, and the 23-year-old Norwegian's record in front of goal looks all the more impressive, particularly at home, where he has yet to draw a blank.</p>
<p>&quot;It's incredible, I can't believe it,&quot; said Solskjaer, who admitted he had not expected to break into the United first-team so soon after his 1.5 million pound ($2.34 million) close season signing from Norway's Molde FC. &quot;To hear 55,000 people chanting my name was unbelievable.&quot;</p>
<p>Solskjaer's form has stunned even Ferguson, who signed him as an investment for the future rather than the present.</p>
<p>The Norwegian's five strikes from 363 minutes on the pitch puts him level in the goal-scoring stakes with Liverpool's Patrik Berger, the other young foreigner currently sending ripples through the premier league.</p>
<p>Like Solskjaer, Berger spent then first few games of the season on the sidelines at Anfield, waiting for a work visa and getting himself match fit.</p>
<p>Since coming on a second half substitute at Leicester a fortnight ago the powerful Czech forward has been unstoppable.</p>
<p>He scored two goals in that match, grabbed another two against Chelsea a week later and added a fifth against Finland's MyPa-47 in the Cup Winners' Cup in midweek.</p>
<p>Berger failed to find the net at the weekend but that did not stop Liverpool winning 2-1 at West Ham -- their sixth straight victory in all competitions.</p>
<p>Their winner on Sunday -- the 15th anniversary of the death of the club's legendary manager Bill Shankly -- was classic Liverpool, Michael Thomas rounding off a 15-pass move started by David James in the Liverpool goal.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a lovely tribute to Shanks,&quot; current Liverpool manager Roy Evans said. &quot;The way we are playing now is the way Shanks would have liked.&quot;</p>
