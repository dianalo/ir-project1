<p>A 17-year-old Alabama boy has been charged with killing his father, his father's live-in girlfriend and the woman's two young daughters, police said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Suspect Mark Duke has been in protective custody since he reported the killings to police on Sunday night, they said. A friend, 19-year-old Michael Brandon Samra, was also jailed with him on capital murder charges.</p>
<p>The pair were accused in the slaying of Randy Duke, 39; his girlfriend Dedra Mims Hunt, 29; and Hunt's daughters Chelsea and Chelisa, aged 6 and 7. The four were killed Sunday night at their home in the Birmingham suburb of Pelham.</p>
<p>Police would not say how the victims died but local media reports said the adults had been shot in the head and the children's throats had been slashed. No motive was disclosed.</p>
<p>Pelham Police Chief Allen Wade said the arrests stemmed from information made by callers in response to a $20,000 reward offer. More arrests were expected involving suspects in lesser but related crimes, he added.</p>
