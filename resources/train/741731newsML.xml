<p>Rubber growers in India's southern state of Kerala are threatening to pressure the government to intervene in the market to halt a crash in prices, their leaders said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Farmers will go on an agitation if the government does not intervene and get better prices for rubber,&quot; said Vamadevan Nair, president of Small Rubber Farmers' Association.</p>
<p>But he did not give details of the planned action by the rubber growers in the state, which accounts for the bulk of the country's natural rubber production.</p>
<p>Traders said rubber was currently quoted in the southern markets of Kozhikode and Kottayam at 34-37 rupees per kg compared to 51.25 rupees a year ago.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the government asked the State Trading Corporation to intervene in the market to check the sharp fall in prices.</p>
<p>Kerala state chief minister E.K. Nayanar said the federal government should take steps to export at least 10,000 tonnes of natural rubber to give relief to the growers. He did not give further details.</p>
<p>He said the government should also impose a duty on imported rubber, which at present was cheaper by 6.0 rupees per kg compared to domestic prices.</p>
<p>Traders said rubber prices had been falling mainly due to poor demand from the automobile and tyre industry and general lethargy in the country's overall industrial production.</p>
<p>Another commodity that was expected to draw market attention this week was edible oil.</p>
<p>Indian edible oil prices were likely to firm following a recovery in the Malaysian palm olein market.</p>
<p>Navinbhai Shah, president of the Bombay Oilseeds and Oil Exchange Ltd, said a recovery in domestic prices in the last few days days had been due to firming Malaysian palm olein prices.</p>
<p>Malaysian palm olein is the main component of India's edible oil imports.</p>
<p>Traders said palm olein was quoted two rupees higher at 260 rupees per 10 kg in the domestic market last week.</p>
<p>Groundnut oil, the most popular Indian cooking medium, gained 8.0 rupees to 370 rupees per 10 kg over the last week.</p>
<p>Also on the rise was gold, in line with world prices which have been recovering from 12-year lows reached in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Urban demand has started picking up in India because of low prices,&quot; said V.M Kapoor, president of Gold Jewellery Exporters' Association.</p>
<p>Kapoor said gold imports had risen in the last few days following a drop in world gold prices.</p>
<p>The premium on special import licences needed for importing gold had risen to 12.0 percent from 9.0 percent, he said.</p>
<p>In the week to Friday, the price of standard gold (24 carat) rose 70 rupees per 10 grammes to 4,540 rupees.</p>
<p>&quot;Fresh physical buying at lower levels and rising premiums on import licences helped local prices bounce back,&quot; said Bhayabhai Sanghavi, a leading bullion dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;Renewed investment buying further helped the rally, Sanghavi said.</p>
<p>Sanghavi said some stock market players booked profits in the share market and diverted their excess funds into gold.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expect rural demand for gold to pick up midway through the four-month June-September monsoon season.</p>
<p>Sowing in cash crops such as cotton and oilseeds has been completed in most states, they said.</p>
<p>Officials in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, which accounts for 80 percent of the country's soybean production, said sowing of the oilseed had been completed in vast areas.</p>
<p>They said soybean sowing in more than 60 percent of the state's 4.0 million hectares had been completed.</p>
<p>&quot;The crop condition is normal,&quot; an official said.</p>
<p>Cotton traders said sowing had been completed in most states and the country could head for another good crop in the 1997/98 season (October/September).</p>
<p>India's 1996/97 cotton crop has been estimated at a record 17 million bales, higher than an earlier anticipated 16.78 million. It was 16.27 million in the previous season.</p>
