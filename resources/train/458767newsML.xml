<p>Polish T-bill yields are expected rise at Monday's primary tender as the market would try to push them up towards the higher yielding NBP-bills, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said a yield rise may also be fuelled by low demand, expected to dip from last week's 1.3 billion zlotys to some 900 million against the 1.2 billion zloty offer due to an expected cash shortage before the end of this month's reserve period. @</p>
<p>Polish T-bill yields rose almost 1.5 point over the  last month to 21.24 percent on the longest 52-week paper, but were still falling behind similar maturity NBP-bills which yield 22 percent, leaving room for their further growth.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Poland keeps yields of its bills high to curb fast credit growth and cool-down internal demand to limit Poland's trade gap.</p>
<p>The bank has also raised banks' obligatory reserves and the reverse repo rate to tighten its monetary policy. @</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, that the upward thrust of T-bill yields was slowing and expected the maximum yield of the 52-week paper to reach a ceiling at around 21.50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The upward pressure on T-bill yields is weakening, and the finance ministry is not likely to let them grow much further either,&quot; said Marek Zelinski from Bank Slaski SA.</p>
<p>On Monday the maximum yield of the 52-week paper was expected to reach 21.45 percent against last auction's 21.34 percent, partly on interest from foreign investors. @</p>
<p>The maximum yields of the 26- and 13-week papers were seen at 21.40 and 21.50 percent against the last auction's 21.26 and 21.42 percent respectively.</p>
<p>They said that after the good February inflation data the central bank was not likely to raise the already high yields of NBP-bills in line with the rise of its 14-day reverse repo rate to 22.15 percent from 21.65 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not expect NBP-bills to rise above the current 22 percent and they are likely to be around 50 basis points above T-bills, which are likely to reach this level in up to two weeks,&quot; said Marek Jezierski from PBI SA. @</p>
<p>Year-on-year inflation fell to 17.3 percent in February from 17.8 percent in January and the government wants to bring it down to 13 percent in December 1997.</p>
<p>Analysts expected the zloty to stay anchored around present levels next week after recent central bank and finance ministry statements that no changes in the monthly zloty devaluation rate -- the crawling peg, should be expected in the near-term.</p>
<p>Analysts said the lack of prospects for a crawling peg cut and the recent NBP intervention against the rising zloty signalled no chances for a near-term zloty rise and was likely to keep foreign speculators on the sidelines at the tender. @</p>
<p>Longer-term foreign investors, bullish on Poland because of the country's improving fundamentals, bought an estimated $35 million worth of five-year fixed bonds at this week's primary tender. Dealers expected this amount to flow onto the domestic forex market before the settlement date on April 5, 1997.</p>
<p>The zloty ended the week at 2.97/2.91 percent from the parity rate, flat from 2.98/2.94 percent last Friday's close.</p>
<p>Money market rates were seen keeping above the reverse repo rate of 22.15 percent next week, as banks would try to square positions strained by monthly tax payments ahead of the last working day of the March reserve period on Friday. @</p>
