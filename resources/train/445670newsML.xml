<p>Sammi Steel Co's aim to post the first profit in six years is expected to be hampered by huge financial costs linked to debts at its sister firms and weak product prices, analysts said over the weekend.</p>
<p>The specialised maker of hot-rolled stainless steel plates ran a net loss of 119.98 billion won ($136.5 million) in 1996, sharply up from a 39.45 billion won loss in 1995, due largely to huge financial expenses resulting from its debt servicing.</p>
<p>Sammi spokesman Hwang Chul-gyu said on Saturday it targeted to record a 7.9 billion won after-tax net profit this year by significantly cutting back on its debts.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to pay back about 700 billion won worth of debts this year. It will help us cut financial costs linked to debts by about 140 billion won from last year,&quot; Hwang said.</p>
<p>He said the company plans to spend most of its income from the sale of part of its speciality iron rod production business to Pohang Iron and Steel Co (POSCO).</p>
<p>The deal was valued at 719.4 billion won and payment is due to completed during the first half of this year, he said.</p>
<p>But analysts said that although the planned debt repayments will help Sammi Steel cut financial expenses, heavy debts at its affiliates could hamper the company's earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;Sammi Steel will be pressured to share some of the money with its affiliates having heavy debts,&quot; said Soo Sohn, an analyst at ING-Baring Securities.</p>
<p>Sammi Corp, whose core business is selling products and purchasing materials for Sammi Steel, on Saturday announced its net loss had climbed to 45.81 billion won in 1996 from a year earlier's 26.85 billion won loss.</p>
<p>A Sammi Corp official also blamed huge financial costs resulting from debts for the expanded net loss, although he gave no details on its debt position.</p>
<p>Sammi Steel's total liabilities stood at 17.6 times its total assets at the end of 1996, compared with 6.4 times at end-1995 and 8.8 times at end-1994.</p>
<p>Sammi Corp had total liabilities of 538.5 billion won at the end of 1995, about seven times the company's assets valued at 77.3 billion won. Figures for 1996 were not available.</p>
<p>Weak prices of stainless steel products, as a result of the continued slowdown of the national economy, should also depress Sammi Steel's business this year, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The critical point seems to have passed in the company. But it is still faced with difficulty as weak prices for its main products are not likely to pick up at least until late this year,&quot; said Kim Nam-soo, an analyst at Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>ING-Baring's Sohn agreed, saying the weak prices would erode the profit margin on Sammi Steel's main products, most widely used in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Growing competition in line with plans by other local steelmakers to expand production capacity for stainless steel plates is also expected to threaten Sammi Steel's efforts for survival, analysts said.</p>
<p>They said among Sammi Steel's competitors, Daiyang Metal Co and Inchon Iron and Steel Co were said to be planning capacity expansion.</p>
<p>Details on these companies' plans were not available.</p>
