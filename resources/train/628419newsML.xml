<p>Alarmed by reports of massacres of Rwandan refugees, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday called for an immediate end to violence against the exiles in the new Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>The U.S.-initiated statement, read at a formal meeting, was the first since President Laurent Kabila's rebels ousted former President Mobutu Sese Seko, the Central African country's leader for 32 years.</p>
<p>The council's statement also called for the &quot;withdrawal of all external forces&quot; and asked for peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of &quot;democratic and free elections with the participation of all parties.&quot;</p>
<p>Diplomats said the statement was meant to give backing to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the Organisation of African Unity summit next week and send a warning to Kabila, who was sworn in as president on Thursday. The new president has ignored other opposition parties in Zaire but promised to hold elections in 1999.</p>
<p>The main U.N. thrust was human rights for the refugees, remnants of more than 1 million Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 to escape reprisal for the genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Some are responsible for the genocide but most are civilians.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the council) is particularly concerned by reports that refugees in the east of the country are being systematically killed,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;It calls for an immediate end to the violence against refugees in the country,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The 15-member body again called &quot;in the strongest terms for complete cooperation with the U.N. mission investigating reports of massacres, other atrocities and violations of international law in the country.&quot; Investigators so far have been refused access to suspected mass graves.</p>
<p>The statement follows a U.N. appeal on Wednesday to individual governments to impress Kabila with their stand on human rights. At least a dozen major countries, including the United States, said they would tell their ambassadors in Kinshasa to make a joint appeal to Kabila.</p>
<p>China delayed Thursday's statement, at first saying the council had no right to interfere in the internal affairs of another country but then presenting amendments.</p>
<p>Consequently, the statement said the council &quot;opposes any interference in its internal affairs.&quot;</p>
