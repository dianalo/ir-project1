<title>USA: EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS -  WSC - 18-FEB.</title>
<headline>EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS -  WSC - 18-FEB.</headline>
<text>
<p>Tropical Cyclone Harold, with 65 mph winds, is in the Coral Sea, east of Queensland, Australia, near 17.3s/155.0e, moving south-southwest at 8 mph. Harold is expected to turn more southerly and eventually more southeasterly away from mainland Australia over the next 48-72 hours while slowly strengthening. The threat to shipping from this system will continue.  </p>
<p>Tropical Cyclone Karlette, with 50 mph winds, is in the Indian Ocean near 15.3s/77.2e, moving west at 7 mph. A turn to the west southwest is likely this period as Karlette slowly intensifies. Karlette is only a primarily a threat to shipping at this time.  </p>
<p>Storms continue to be very strong in the northeastern Atlantic, spreading areas of strong westerly winds across northwestern Europe. This is again expected during the next few days through midweek. High seas cause problems for shipping in the North Sea and English Channel.</p>
