<p>America's hasty withdrawal from northern Iraq is the cause as much as the consequence of deteriorating security here and the primary reason why the panicked Kurds who worked for the U.S. are queuing to leave.</p>
<p>That is the picture which emerged from interviews with some of those Kurds, who are huddled with their families, suitcases packed, in small hotels and private residences in Iraqi towns near the Turkish border, waiting to be evacuated.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Americans were staying, then I would probably stay as well because I would know that if Saddam came the United States would have to intervene to protect its own citizens,&quot; explained one Kurd who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;But when Iraqi troops came to Arbil two weeks ago the Americans pulled out of Kurdistan immediately. We had been promised an evacuation plan for years, but there wasn't one. Now we have to leave or we may not get another chance.&quot;</p>
<p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent troops, tanks and artillery to support Kurdish chieftain Massoud Barzani when his forces captured the main Kurdish city of Arbil from a rival faction on August 31.</p>
<p>The United States and its allies had advance warning of the Iraqi interference. No military attempt was made to prevent the attack despite an allied pledge to defend northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Instead, the episode was dismissed as an internal Kurdish dispute. Punitive cruise missile attacks were conducted against Iraqi military targets after the fact, and American military based in the border town of Zakho and civilian personnel stationed in Iraqi Kurdistan were withdrawn.</p>
<p>The United States is now dismantling its sprawling aid and intelligence operations in northern Iraq and preparing to evacuate hundreds of Kurds who were involved as programme administrators, drivers, guards, messengers and spies.</p>
<p>Operation Provide Comfort, a U.S.-led safe haven implemented to protect northern Iraq after a Kurdish rebellion collapsed in 1991 at the end of the Gulf War, appears to be on its last legs.</p>
<p>Turkey, a key player in the operation because of its airbases and control of the northern Iraqi border, has been expressing reservations about Provide Comfort for years as it says the allied protection helps its own Turkish rebel Kurds to operate in the region.</p>
<p>The evacuation of virtually the entire human infrastructure on which U.S.-supported aid operations depended will deal a severe blow to ongoing Kurdish efforts to rebuild their devastated Iraqi homeland.</p>
<p>Not only are Kurdish employees of the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and their families being evacuated, but so, evidently, are Kurdish workers for non-governmental agencies under contract to OFDA.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has also advised Americans working for other aid agencies to withdraw as well.</p>
<p>Kurdish leader Barzani, who now controls all of northern Iraq, vows to keep Iraqi trops and their agents out and to protect aid workers. Barzani says no one has been attacked since the fighting for Arbil on August 31.</p>
<p>He and Saddam have both offered general amnesties to their Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) opponents -- but with exceptions.</p>
<p>The opposition Iraqi National Congress (INC), which had bases in northern Iraq, said in a statement on Saturday that senior Iraqi military intelligence and secret service officers had moved their headquarters from Kirkuk to Arbil. The INC previously reported that opposition activists in Arbil had been rounded up and arrested or executed by Iraqi security forces.</p>
<p>Many foreign aid workers are sceptical, however, that risks have increased since August 31, and see only the apparently diminished U.S. commitments to this area as a sign of this.</p>
<p>&quot;We dont see much of a change in the security situation, but we cannot afford to simply ignore the warnings from Washington,&quot; Ron Sobkoviak, of the U.S.-based aid agency Shelter Now International, told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a lot of project commitment that we want to follow through on so we are staying, but with reduced staff. The Kurds have promised to provide us with protection. We are just not getting very clear information from the Americans.&quot;</p>
