<title>SPAIN: Spain to present plan on stability pact compliance.</title>
<headline>Spain to present plan on stability pact compliance.</headline>

<p>Spain's government will present a three-year plan to other European countries in May aimed at ensuring its compliance with a European monetary union stability pact from 1998 to 2000, Spanish Economy Minister Cristobal Montoro said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This plan will be ready in May,&quot; Montoro said at a news conference, adding it will be presented before the final summit of the Dutch EU presidency in June.</p>
<p>&quot;We can stay beneath two percent (public deficit as percentage of gross domestic product) in the next three years without raising taxes,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Montoro said the plan to comply with the stability pact will include liberalisation measures already under discussion and will be based on the outlook of low inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;In the future, the inflation rate will stay below the economic growth rate which in real terms will be above two percent,&quot; Montoro predicted.</p>
<p>In January, the inflation rate fell to 2.9 percent year-on-year from 3.2 percent in December.</p>
<p>Montoro stressed the importance of the outlook for reduced inflation in keeping expenditures under control.  </p>
<p>&quot;...For example it won't be necessary to freeze public servant wages or to reduce purchasing power of pensions (in order to control the public expendinture),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The public deficit is vital to the reduction of interest rates which is also important to boost growth, the minister added.</p>
<p>The new plan for compliance will end just as the term of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is concluding when it will be important to have sustained economic growth, Montorro said. &quot;The creation of jobs will be our success.&quot;  </p>
<p>On the trend in the European economy, Montoro said there is a recovery which could be boosted by the recent dollar strength.</p>
<p>&quot;The European outlook is not negative. The 'drama' is that it is not yet clear if there is enough growth to meet the convergence criteria,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last Friday Spain's government presented a full set of measures aimed at liberalising property and telecommunications, regulations intended to ensure reduced inflation and sustained growth.</p>
<p>&quot;These measures are a follow-up to the measures already approved in June 1996 and they will be part of our (stability) plan,&quot; said Montoro.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to follow with the structural measures. None of these are crash measures. The best thing for Spain to do is structural reforms,&quot; Montoro added.</p>
<p>He added the government is already benefitting from these in terms of low inflation and good credit conditions or low interest rates.</p>
<p>Montoro said another important step for Spain is labour market reform, which trade unions and employers are currently discussing. Those reforms will be introduced in this global plan when ready.</p>
<p>Asked about remarks from other European countries sceptical that Spain will be among the founders of a single currency, the minister said they cannot ignore the economic facts.</p>
