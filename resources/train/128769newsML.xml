<p>France's parliament on Saturday rejected a proposed tax hike on fast food nicknamed the &quot;Big Mac tax&quot; fearing it would be unpopular, hit young people and do little to revive traditional bistrots and cafes.</p>
<p>The National Assembly overwhelmingly voted down the recommendation by its finance commission to raise Value Added Tax (VAT) on takeaway food from the current 5.5 percent to the standard rate of 20.6 percent.</p>
<p>Most deputies argued the amendment, nicknamed the &quot;Big Mac Tax&quot; because it would hit U.S. hamburger giant McDonalds Corp along with sandwich sellers and other fast food outlets, would penalise young people who are big takeaway customers.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians also argued the tax would be unpopular and could threaten jobs.</p>
<p>Traditional cafe and restaurant owners, who have to pay the full VAT rate on food and drink, argue fast food outlets get an unfair advantage by paying the lower VAT rate on retail food.</p>
<p>Pierre Mehaignerie, a member of Prime Minister Alain Juppe's Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) party and head of the finance commission who opposed the amendment, conceded there was a &quot;distortion&quot; in the current tax system.</p>
<p>But he said: &quot;Let's be careful that public opinion doesn't see in all of this a hike in VAT and prices.&quot; France is pushing through unpopular austerity measures in a bid to cut budget deficit to qualify for a single European currency from 1999.</p>
<p>Support for the amendment collapsed and just two members of the centre-right coalition voted for the amendment, with others in the 577-seat parliament voting against along with opposition Socialists and Communists.</p>
<p>Laurent Dominati, a centrist who drafted and voted for the amendment, said &quot;Let's stop favouring some people. I simply ask, as a true liberal, to ensure fair competition.&quot;</p>
<p>Finance Minister Jean Arthuis spoke out earlier this week against the amendment, saying his aim was to bring down VAT rates for traditional restaurants.</p>
