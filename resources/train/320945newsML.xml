<p>LME three months copper drifted lower in late inter-office trading on Tuesday evening as values backed off from an earlier approach towards resistance at $2,290 a tonne.</p>
<p>By 1900 GMT three months copper was indicated at $2,249/53 per tonne, slightly down from its afternoon kerb close of $2,255, which was down $15 on the day.</p>
<p>Earlier, copper hit a high of $2,280 in a halfhearted attempt to vault resistance at $2,290.</p>
<p>&quot;The upside still remains the favoured direction, with the backwardation within the spread remaining firm,&quot; said Rudolf Woolf in its evening metal report.</p>
<p>It added that most of the metal being delivered was arriving in the U.S. and being attributed to the inter-market arbitrage against Comex.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, unless continued and significant deliveries are seen into other locations, it can be assumed that there is little spare material in the system and that physical demand remains strong.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders noted the sharply higher copper output reported by Minera Escondida Ltda for December. Total production reached 841,361 tonnes for all of last year, up about 80 percent from 1995.</p>
<p>The mine officially passed Codelco's Chuquicamata mine, which produces about 620,000 tonnes of copper a year, as the world's largest copper pit last year.</p>
<p>Reporting company operating results for 1996 , the chairman of Alumax Inc said world primary aluminium consumption appeared ready to resume its upward trend in 1997 after two years of essentially flat demand.</p>
<p>The other metals were little changed.</p>
