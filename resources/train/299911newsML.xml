<p>A slim majority of analysts polled by Reuters believe U.K. interest rates will remain unchanged at six percent after next week's monetary meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George.</p>
<p>Of 20 experts surveyed, 12 predicted that Clarke would keep rates unchanged after next Wednesday's meeting.</p>
<p>The other eight said he would raise rates by a quarter percent, while one economist, Sharda Persaud of San Paulo Bank, predicted a rise of half a percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There are few other opportunities to raise rates before the election,&quot; said Persaud.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed that political considerations, with a general election now just weeks away and Clarke's Conservatives lagging badly in opinion polls, would weigh heavily on the chancellor's mind at his monthly meeting with George. The election must be held by May 22.</p>
<p>They said sterling's inexorable rise in recent months would make it easier for Clarke to overrule George's desire for an increase in base rates, which was only slightly tempered after a 25-point rise last October.</p>
<p>The Bank of England governor is pressing for a rise in order to prevent any signs of overheating in the increasingly healthy British economy, which in turn would fuel inflation.</p>
<p>The economists said a set of disappointing data released on Friday -- British manufacturing output fell 0.5 percent during November -- increased the chance of rates staying steady.</p>
<p>&quot;Before the data, we were more confident of a rate rise. Although the figures have cut back the chances, on balance we still think he will go for a quarter-point rise,&quot; said Daiwa economist Katy Peters.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the experts who predicted no rates change said Clarke would take the opportunity at next month's meeting for a 25-point rise.</p>
<p>&quot;The timing of a pre-election rate rise is in the balance, but we suspect that a move is marginally more likely to come in February than in the aftermath of Wednesday's meeting,&quot; said Alex Garrard of Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;The chancellor will hold out for more data. He has seen the evidence that Christmas retail sales were reasonable but not particularly strong,&quot; said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturing output has declined, and sterling has risen four to five percent since the last rate rise, so there are justifications for him to defer for another month,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the economists predicting the rates hike next week said Clarke would want to get the bad news out of the way so that it would have faded from voters' minds well before the election.</p>
