<headline>Irishman speaks of lost $3 million lottery ticket.</headline>

<p>A young Irish actor spoke on Monday of his anguish at losing a winning $3 million lottery ticket last week, which is now thought to be lying in a rubbish dump in the west of Ireland.</p>
<p>Crowds of treasure-hunters are expected to flock to the refuse site in search of the winning lottery ticket worth two million punts ($3.25 million) thought to be buried there.</p>
<p>Newspapers initially reported that the winning ticket was lost on a mountainside.</p>
<p>Young Irish actor Padraic O Tuairisc said he believed he had bought the winning ticket while on a camping trip with his American girlfriend Michelle Conway -- and had accidentally thrown it away.</p>
<p>But would-be treasure hunters will have to wade through a mountain of rubbish. &quot;It's now more than 10 days, and that pit accepts up to 15 truckloads a day,&quot; O Tuairisc said. &quot;So you're talking about 150 truckloads.&quot;</p>
<p>A ticket bought on Achill Island in the far west of Ireland won the country's weekly lottery draw on August 28, but nobody came forward to claim the prize. Locals said a frantic young couple had been searching the area for the ticket, and on Monday the pair broke their silence to speak to the media.</p>
<p>According to lottery rules, the winning ticket must be produced to claim the jackpot, and whoever produces the ticket will be entitled to the prize.</p>
<p>O Tuairisc said he had thrown away his ticket before hearing the winning numbers. After realising their mistake, the couple began a desperate search of the local rubbish dump, but although they found the remains of some chicken noodles they had thrown away at the same time, there was no trace of the ticket.</p>
<p>&quot;We were walking on everything, we didn't really care,&quot; O Tuairisc told Irish radio. &quot;A couple of days after that, with new clothes and many showers, we could still smell the odour.&quot;</p>
<p>But his misfortune has not put him off the lottery. &quot;I haven't stopped doing it. I'm doing it every week now,&quot; he said.&quot; ($1=.6178 Punt)</p>
