<p>Four New York girls were killed on their way to school on Thursday when a huge maple tree was toppled by fierce winds, crushing the van they were travelling in, officials said.</p>
<p>Six people, two adults and four children, were injured in the freak accident on a suburban street in the New York City borough of Queens. They were treated for minor injuries at the hospital, police and fire officials said.</p>
<p>Winds were blowing at about 50 mph (80 kph) when the tree, 60-feet (18-metre) tall and 48 inches (122 cm) in diameter, was torn from its roots and smashed onto the van.</p>
<p>All of those killed were sitting in the back two rows of the van, police said. The dead children were all girls between the ages of 10 and 13.</p>
<p>&quot;This large tree impacted the vehicle, crushing the occupants inside,&quot; said John McCormack, deputy chief of the New York City Fire Department.</p>
<p>&quot;We used the jaws of life and then the Emergency Medical Service personnel went into the van to check on the victims, and then we cut the tree in pieces to get it off the van,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The strong winds blew debris all over the city streets, toppling garbage cans and breaking branches off trees as the weather service put out a high-wind warning. There were some minor delays at the region's three major airports of Newark, New Jersey, Kennedy and La Guardia.</p>
<p>National Weather Service meteorologists said winds of 30 mph (48 kph) to 40 mph (64 kph) could be expected for much of Thursday, with gusts of more than 60 mph (96 kph)  at times. They said the winds should start to diminish around sunset.</p>
<p>Meteorologist Scott Reynolds said the fierce winds were being caused by an intense low pressure system moving over eastern Massachusetts that was expected to travel into the seas off Canada by Friday.</p>
