<p>LIFFE cocoa futures ended Tuesday with pared losses on late short-covering after early falls on sterling's jump against German mark, traders said.</p>
<p>But conditions remained lethargic with volume totalling just 2,634 lots by the finish.</p>
<p>&quot;It's in no man's land,&quot; said one. &quot;The market is taking stock after last weeks's sell-off which damaged sentiment. It needs time to recover.&quot;</p>
<p>After displaying some strength in the past two days, the market was knocked lower this morning by sterling's strength against the mark.</p>
<p>Sterling powered above 2.97 German marks to its highest since May 1991 early on Tuesday, boosted by stronger-than-expected UK inflation statistics for June.</p>
<p>By late Tuesday afternoon, sterling/mark stood at 2.9756 versus 2.9385/95 in late European trading on Monday.</p>
<p>LIFFE's September cocoa fell to a low of 1,024 stg a tonne before closing five higher at 1,043 stg. Its high-point was 1,045.</p>
<p>A strong sterling discouraged cocoa demand by continential European buyers.</p>
<p>Sterling also rose against the dollar, reaching near seven-month highs after the unexpectedly strong rise in the UK inflation suggested there may be an increase in interest rates this week.</p>
<p>Despite the setback on cocoa, traders said the firmer fundamental picture remained intact.</p>
<p>In the longer-term, the industry is worried over the adverse impact of the El Nino weather pattern, which could set in by December, on the future harvest.</p>
<p>In the medium-term, there's a possibility of a late crop in West Africa although the supply prospects have improved significantly.</p>
<p>Private pod counters touring the Ivory Coast were now turning to the opinion that a big crop was likely next year, with some expecting a bigger crop than in 1996/97, broker GNI said.</p>
<p>News from Abidjan put Ivorian arrivals at 1.05-1.06 million tonnes for the 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) crop by July 4 compared to around 1.148 million at the same stage in the record 1995/96 season.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the CFTC Commitments of Traders report released after Monday's close showed speculators (non-commercials and nonreportables) were net long 33,724 lots as of July 1, but did not reflect the recent sharp sell-off. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
