<p>The global food situation has improved but war and famine have hit some of the world's poorest nations who need large-scale assistance, the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) said on Monday.</p>
<p>The agency's special report, released ahead of its World Food Summit in Rome this week, was prepared before the crisis in eastern Zaire which has left more than a million starving refugees with no access to food or water.</p>
<p>The summit, promoted by FAO and its Senegalese director-general Jacques Diouf, will set the achievement of food security for all as the international community's goal.</p>
<p>The summit's declaration will also commit leaders to reducing the number of undernourished people in the world to half its present level by no later than 2015.</p>
<p>FAO's report highlighted the problems faced by poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the ex-Soviet Union while hailing a general improvement in food supplies in 1996.</p>
<p>The agency's latest forecast for 1996 global cereal production was an estimated 1.849 billion tonnes, 6.9 percent higher than the level of 1995. Global wheat output, helped by bumper crops in Europe, was 6.4 percent higher.</p>
<p>FAO said global rice production was forecast rising &quot;significantly&quot; and end-of-season cereal carryover stocks were set for their first increase in four years.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for global food supplies in 1996/97 has improved somewhat since the last report,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;With most of the world's 1996 cereal crops already harvested or about to be gathered, FAO's forecast of global production has become more firm and now indicates a larger recovery from 1995 than earlier expected.&quot;</p>
<p>But the picture remained bleak for many, with some countries such as Sierra Leone relying on aid to survive.</p>
<p>The agency said indications also pointed to a further erosion of cereal stocks in the developing countries, which were forecast to fall to their lowest level since 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;In sub-Saharan Africa food supplies for 1996/97 have improved compared to the previous year,&quot; FAO said.</p>
<p>&quot;However some 40 percent of the total population of sub-Saharan Africa is already chronically undernourished and this number could rise unless action is taken.&quot;</p>
<p>Parts of Liberia were suffering from famine, Somalia had been hit by a combination of drought, insect damage and flooding while Angola and Mozambique had large displaced populations.</p>
<p>Afghanistan and Iraq suffered shortages due to fighting while Mongolia and Yemen required relief assistance. North Korea and Laos had been severely hit by extensive flooding.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall there is a pressing need for large-scale national and international intervention to bring about a rapid improvement in the food security situation of the affected countries,&quot; the FAO report concluded.</p>
<p>However it warned that global food aid availability in 1996/97 was not expected to improve much from the low 1995/96 level of 7.2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, most low-income food-deficit countries in Africa also face a bleak economic outlook and acute balance of payments difficulties,&quot; the FAO report said.</p>
