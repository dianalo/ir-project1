<p>Four employees of the French-based charity Action Contre la Faim (Action against Hunger) have been arrested in the Afghan capital Kabul, witnesses said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The four men, two French expatriates and two local staff members, were being held by the Islamic Taleban militia, which seized Kabul last September.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman at ACF Paris headquarters confirmed the detention of expatriates Frederic Michel and Daniel Llorente, in charge of the charity's logistics in Kabul.</p>
<p>She said they were taken by Talebans from the United Nations compound in Kabul on Friday night but declined to give more details.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear why the four had been arrested or if they were charged with any crime.</p>
<p>The arrests followed a lunch organised by expatriate female staff of Action Contre la Faim (ACF) for local female employees.</p>
<p>Witnesses said as many as 15 armed Taleban fighters entered the ACF residence at about 1:00 p.m. (0830 GMT) on Friday, arresting a cook and a security guard, searching the house and removing cameras, photographs, magazines and films.</p>
<p>The two expatriates were arrested early on Saturday at the United Nations International Community Association building in central Kabul -- where they were staying -- after protracted discussions between Taleban authorities and U.N. officials.</p>
<p>Taleban authorities have said the portrayal of images of living human beings in photographs and paintings runs counter to Islamic law.</p>
<p>The ACF runs a number of projects in Kabul, including nutritional surveys and an emergency children feeding programme. It has suspended the projects until the situation has been clarified.</p>
<p>Taleban authorities, which now control some 80 percent of the country, want to impose their strict interpretation of Islam throughout war-ravaged Afghanistan.</p>
