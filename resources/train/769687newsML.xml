<p>President Bill Clinton on Thursday named General Michael Ryan, commander of U.S. air forces in Europe, as Air Force chief of staff, succeeding General Ronald Fogleman, who resigned earlier this week.</p>
<p>Ryan, who also holds the post of commander of NATO air forces in central Europe based at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, was responsible for coordinating air strikes two years ago that helped drive warring parties in Bosnia to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters Clinton had accepted the recommendation of Ryan by Defence Secretary William Cohen at a meeting on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Ryan's father also served in the same post. McCurry said: &quot;He is, as near as we can tell, the first son to follow his father's footsteps as the chief of staff of one of the services. Mike's father John D. Ryan, served as chief of staff of the Air Force from 1961 to 1973.&quot;</p>
<p>Ryan is a former fighter pilot who flew combat missions over Vietnam.</p>
<p>Fogleman abruptly submitted his resignation on Monday partly in anticipation of a decision by Cohen to hold another air force general, Terryl Schwalier, responsible for failing to guard adequately against the truck bomb that killed 19 U.S. airmen in Saudi Arabia last year.</p>
