<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 offer prices ended mixed in quiet trading on Thursday, with traders expecting a bearish trend on sluggish demand.</p>
<p>They said the market discounted the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>&quot;The market generally ignores Deng Xiaoping's death,&quot; said one trader, adding that prices were mixed on expectation of further softening as buyers were scant.</p>
<p>Traders said SIR20 March price was slightly higher at 54.125 U.S. cents/lb fob Padang against morning's level of 54.00 U.S. cents/lb. But offer prices fell 0.50 U.S. cents to 54.00 fob Medan and Surabaya.  </p>
<p>Traders said offer prices fell to 53.75 U.S. cents in Jambi against morning's price of 54.00, but levels were unchanged in Pontianak at 53.75. U.S. cents/lb.</p>
<p>Traders said U.S. buyers had came in, but orders were meagre at about 120 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a number of deals done but prices were low because there were not enough buyers out there,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Traders said buyers seemed to be waiting for prices to decline further. &quot;There is nothing much we can do. Prices can go as low as 53.00 U.S. cents/lb,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>Traders said they were still waiting for fresh enquiries from other foreign buyers.</p>
