<p>Shares of Thai publisher and media group Wattachak Plc swung 20 percent during Thursday morning trade after the company denied it was facing financial problems.</p>
<p>Wattachak shares gained the daily 10 percent limit high, up 1.50 baht to 16.50 by the lunchbreak. The stock topped the active list.  </p>
<p>Wattachak opened Thursday down a 10 percent limit low at 13.50 baht before it rebounded.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement to the Stock Exchange of Thailand that late submission of its annual results was an unfounded cause of concern among investors.</p>
<p>Wattachak's failure to submit annual results within 60 days from the year-end raised market concern over its financial position, traders said.</p>
<p>The media group's stock price fell more than 50 percent in the eight previous trading sessions.</p>
<p>Wattachak's sharp decline prompted more sales by retail buyers, especially those who had bought the issue on margin loans, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been a lot of forced sales on this stock over the last few days. People were nervous about the company because it had not submitted its (consolidated) financial statements. The movement today is unusual,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Wattachak on Wednesday reported a 1996 unconsolidated profit of 119.2 million baht against 349 million in 1995. REUTERS jam va</p>
