<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-12-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shanghai's B share index lost early gains and ended slightly down on Tuesday due to sharp losses on the A share market, as a result of rumours of a new official crackdown, traders said.</p>
<p>The index lost 0.099 points or 0.15 percent to 64.588 points, on volume of 17.1 million shares worth $8.2 million.</p>
<p>The A index dived 39.179 points or 4.17 percent to 900.767, on volume of 329.9 million shares worth 2.8 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Rumours said Beijing would take new measures against speculation, possibly by adopting a three-day settlement system to replace the current next-day settlement.  </p>
<p>Officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>The SSE 30 blue-chip index fell 77.336 points or 3.18 percent to 2354.363 points. Of 42 B shares, 40 traded, with 18 down, seven flat and 15 up.</p>
<p>Kunming Machine was the biggest loser on expectations of poor results, falling 0.39 yuan or 10.05 percent to 3.49 yuan, on volume of 1.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Brokers said falls of domestic A shares late in the session sparked liquidation selling in the B share market, with limited institutional support ahead of the Christmas holiday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Individual investors dominated trading while major overseas investors enjoyed their holiday,&quot; one broker said. &quot;The market has no momentum to rise or fall in the short term.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The index will continue to move between 63 and 65 points in the next few days until fresh market-moving news emerges,&quot; a second broker said.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rubber Belt was the biggest loser, down $0.016 or 6.25 percent to $0.240, on volume of 68,700 shares.</p>
<p>Textile company Worldbest traded the most on institutional unwinding selling, falling $0.002 or 0.55 percent to $0.360, on volume of 1.9 million shares.  </p>
<p>Real estate developer Lujiazui bucked the trend on its announcement of a four-for-ten bonus issue, rising $0.026 or 2.13 percent to $1.246, on volume of 1.8 million shares.</p>
