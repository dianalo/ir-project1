<p>The bodies of a Turkish woman and five of her children who died in a suspected racist arson attack in The Hague were flown to Turkey on Saturday for their funeral, the state-run Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>The six will be buried later on Saturday in Eleskirt in the eastern Turkish province of Agri, the agency said.</p>
<p>Turkey's state minister for human rights, Lutfu Esengun, and environment minister Ziyattin Tokar, who will be present at the funeral, said Europe should look to its own rights situation before criticising Turkey, whose European aspirations are hindered by a shaky human rights record.</p>
<p>&quot;It is extremely saddening that a baby that had not even completed its 30th day was among those who died,&quot; Tokar told Anatolian. &quot;Such incidents, which repeatedly take place in Europe and particularly target Turks, are remarkable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As you see, in the West, in Europe, which we call the final cradle of civilisation and aspire to...which we take as an example in human rights and in the way to treat people, this barbarous act took place,&quot; Tokar said.</p>
<p>The fire broke out at the family home at The Hague on Tuesday night, trapping the woman and the five children. Her husband and the couple's five other children escaped by jumping from an upstairs window. Two of the surviving children are still in hospital with serious injuries.</p>
<p>The city's mayor told relatives of the victims that the fire had apparently been deliberately set, according to Dutch newspaper reports, although he emphasised in a television interview that it was still unclear who was responsible or what their motives were.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo has sent a letter of condolence to the Turkish ambassador expressing his sympathy to bereaved relatives and his assurances that every effort would be made to solve the case quickly.</p>
<p>Minister Esengun said a government delegation was planning to visit the Netherlands next week for talks, to see what measures were being taken against racism and the latest attack in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident is the gravest abuse of human rights,&quot; he said. &quot;Ending the right to live, to kill innocent people are acts that have been left behind the times. Unfortunately, this is happening in Europe on the brink of the 21st century.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore people who try to question us on the issue of human rights should first look to themselves...and take precautions,&quot; Esengun said at Ankara airport before boarding the plane to Agri.</p>
