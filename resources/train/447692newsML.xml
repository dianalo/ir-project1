<p>European Union finance ministers on Monday fully backed plans by the two key countries at the heart of European monetary union (EMU) Germany and France, to qualify for the single currency despite Germany's growing debt mountain.</p>
<p>The ministers reaffirmed their belief that the sinngle currency would start on time in 1999 even after German Finance Minister Theo Waigel told them that his country's total debt would be above the target level set in EMU's guiding Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>The ministers, facing mounting speculation of a possible delay in the launch of a common currency, met to consider the credibility of the plans of the two countries which have led the drive towards EMU. They found the plans persuassive.</p>
<p>&quot;They were both convincing to their colleagues that they would meet the goals of the (EMU) convergence criteria,&quot; Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm told a news conference of the plans submitted by the two countries' finance ministers.</p>
<p>The discussion came against a background of record unemployment in Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, and doubts over whether Bonn itself could meet budget targets for EMU entry laid down in the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>Waigel -- who in the past has lectured other European nations on the need for the strictest possible interpretation of the Maastricht criteria -- came to Brussels pleading for special understanding of his country's high debt level.</p>
<p>He said he had succeeded in gaining the ministers' support for the view that special events such as German unification had bloated its debt. &quot;The minister acknowledged no other economy has had such a burden. Only Germany could have borne it.&quot;</p>
<p>EU Commissioner for Monetary Affairs Yves-Thibault de Silguy gave his backing to both plans. &quot;Both programmes are based on realistic and credible assumptions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>France and Germany also assured their colleagues in the 15-nation bloc that further budgetary measures would be taken should their public finances deteriorate during 1997, the year when they will be judged for EMU fitness.</p>
<p>With German unemployment close to 4.8 million, analysts and EU monetary officials had begun to ask if additional spending cuts were needed to meet Bonn's ambitious deficit target of 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>Special attention was given to the immense costs of German reunification and the effect it has had on Bonn's level of debt, which has drifted above the Maastricht treaty threshold of 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>&quot;The (ministers) agreed with the direction of the policies outlined in the convergence programme and were well aware of the unique challenges and the difficult economic situation currently faced by Germany,&quot; Zalm said.</p>
<p>&quot;The (ministers) also appreciated the economic efforts made by Germany to cope with the consequences of unification.&quot;</p>
<p>Under Germany's plan, total debt is seen at 61.5 percent of GDP this year, up from 60.7 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The ministers urged German authorities to take necessary action &quot;to avoid a further upward movement of the debt ratio&quot;.</p>
<p>Bonn's convergence plans also include the relatively optimistic assumption that unemployment in 1997 will not exceed an average of 4.1 million.</p>
<p>Among the other assumptions for 1997 are 2.5 percent real GDP growth, inflation of 1.5 percent and a 6.2 percent yield on long-term government bonds.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said a somewhat slower growth rate of 2.3 percent would also allow Bonn to meet the Maastricht targets.</p>
<p>France's EMU programme, which includes a 3.0 percent deficit-to-GDP target, was noticeably under less scrutiny than Germany's blueprint.</p>
<p>France has been criticised in the past for taking one-off accounting measures to meet EMU preconditions, and French officials appeared to assuage worries that the fall in their deficit would reverse course in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The French minister (Jean Arthuis) assured us that in 1998 the process of budgetary consolidation would be continued,&quot; EU commissioner de Silguy added.</p>
<p>France's convergence plan includes a budget deficit forecast of 2.8 percent of GDP in 1998 and below 2.0 percent in the year 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;This programme was judged complete, realistic and credible by the European Commission and by all of our partners,&quot; Arthuis told a news conference.</p>
<p>Countries wishing to join monetary union will be judged on their 1997 economic performance, the details of which will not be known until early next year.</p>
