<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities traded lower Thursday afternoon, but yield spreads narrowed to U.S. Treasuries most of the day, traders said.</p>
<p>As Treasuries slipped on a number of technical and fundamental factors, market participants found decent bargains in mortgages, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing an uptick in mortgage banker selling, but we're seeing mortgage buying on dips,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>He said eventually buyers will tire themselves out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, traders snapped up deals where found, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've been doing some buying today,&quot; said one head trader at a New York firm. &quot;We still think in this apparent trading range ... mortgages still have some value.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader said he observed several small-size bid lists exchanging hands.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a couple of little ones. Nothing really all that major -- its actually been three yards and a cloud of dust today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By late afternoon Thursday, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent paper was down 12/32 at 99-14/32, yielding 108 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.  </p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues were 12/32 lower as well, at 99-12/32 and 99-17/32, respectively.</p>
<p>The 10-year note was off 10/32 at 99-17/32 to yield 6.56 percent.</p>
<p>Looking forward, traders said it will take some time before pass-throughs shake out of their range.</p>
<p>&quot;They definitely shake out on the way up ... it is on the way down that they are stubborn,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>PSA The Bond Market Trade Association recommended an early 1400 EST/1900 GMT close on Friday and a full close on Monday in observance of Martin Luther King's birthday.</p>
