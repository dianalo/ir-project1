<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends weaker, but off session lows.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends weaker, but off session lows.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee futures pulled back in rollercoaster trading on Friday, pressured by speculative profit-taking and options-related selling on the heels of the market's recent sharp rally, traders said.</p>
<p>But losses were sharply pared by the close, as a substantial drop in prices sparked local and commission house buying, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a wild day,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I guess you could call it a consolidation.&quot;</p>
<p>Benchmark July settled 2.05 cents per lb lower, at 253.15 cents, after ranging from 258.00 to 245.00. Spot May, which set a new lifetime high of 280.00 this morning, fell 0.55 cent, to 276.50 cents, while the back months closed down 0.20 to 2.70.</p>
<p>Coffee prices headed higher at the outset, with several contracts setting new life-of-contract highs, as traders followed through on the market's recent run-up. But views that the market may be overbought inspired a round of nervous profit-taking, traders said.</p>
<p>Downward momentum picked up after the July contract slid below 255.00 cents, activating sell orders and pushing the active down more than 10 cents at one point, before buyers emerged, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was part of a correction,&quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walt Spilka. &quot;It is still overdone on the upside and I expect we'll see a further correction on Monday.&quot;</p>
<p>Some traders said today's downturn may have been nudged along by a build up in stocks reported by both Green Coffee Association of New York and the CSCE.</p>
<p>Additionally, an increase in margins required by the exchange on all coffee contracts, effective today may have put a damper on the market, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The exchange raised margins, certs were up and GCA stocks were up,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The market was looking for a correction and it all added up to some profit-taking.&quot;</p>
<p>The GCA reported after Thursday's close that supplies of green coffee housed in U.S. warehouses rose in April by 198,000 60-kg bags, to 1,855,000 bags.</p>
<p>Most analysts said the figures were mainly neutral and in line with market expectations of a build up of between 100,000 and 300,000 bags.</p>
<p>After today's close, the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks continued to climb. Stocks increased by 4,500 bags, to 41,682 bags as of May 13. There were 8,405 bags of coffee pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>While the market could be in for a further technical setback, some traders said the fundamentals remained supportive. Low inventory levels in both consuming and producing countries, smaller-than-expected crops in some Latin American countries and the upcoming winter season in top-grower Brazil is likely to continue to underpin prices, they said.</p>
<p>Volume reached an estimated 11,122 lots on the day.</p>
