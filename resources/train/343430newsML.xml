<title>BURKINA FASO: Burkina Faso increases size of parliament.</title>

<text>
<p>Burkina Faso's parliament has voted to increase the number of seats in the national assembly from 107 to 111, ahead of parliamentary elections planned for April.</p>
<p>Officials said the move, part of a new electoral law approved on Wednesday, followed an increase in the number of provinces in the West African nation from 30 to 45 and means that there will be one seat for every 90,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>Territorial Administration and Security Minister Yero Boly told parliament this would cut the number of voters per polling station from 1,500 to 1,000.</p>
<p>The new code raises presidential candidates' deposits from two million CFA francs to five million and confers supervision of media coverage during elections to a Higher Information Council.</p>
<p>Parliament also agreed to divide 200 million CFA francs earmarked for distribution to political parties in 1997 into two equal parts -- one for parties currently represented in parliament and one for parties putting up candidates in at least five constituencies.</p>
<p>Parliament on Monday scrapped a provision limiting presidential mandates to two consecutive seven-year terms.</p>
<p>President Blaise Compaore, whose supporters dominate parliament, came to power after a 1987 coup in which his boss, populist leader Captain Thomas Sankara, was killed. His first term as elected president ends in 1998.</p>
