<p>Britain's plans to double the level of privately-financed infrastructure projects within two years could lead to a surge of securitised bond issues.</p>
<p>Bankers said on Wednesday fixed-income investors were eager to participate in the doubling to 14 billion stg of schemes funded through the private finance initiative (PFI).</p>
<p>&quot;With a lot more funding in the pipeline, there is lots of potential business for the capital markets,&quot; said Sue Dale, assistant director capital markets at BZW.  </p>
<p>&quot;Not all (infrastructure deals) are suitable for the capital markets, and so far not that many have used this route. (But) as the market gets used to these instruments there will be more deals,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said on Tuesday in his budget speech Britain was on course to double the value of PFI spending to 14 billion stg by March 1999 from a current level of seven billion stg.</p>
<p>Under PFI, the government aims to shift the capital cost and risk of public investments into private hands.  </p>
<p>The next big deal is the Housing Corp loan sell-off, which will be sold off to one of three bidders.</p>
<p>The next major deal is the sell-off of government loans to British housing associations. Three bidders have been shortlisted to buy the 1.1 billion stg portfolio of loans.</p>
<p>A securitised bond backed by housing association cashflows is expected to be issued to fund the acquisition.</p>
<p>&quot;Bids go in at the end of January, and the first half is expected to be completed in March and second half in April,&quot; said a banker involved in the transaction.  </p>
<p>&quot;I would imagine all three bidders would be considering issuing a securitised bond backed by loan cashflows to finance the acquisition,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This would be mimic the recent sale of Ministry of Defence married quarters to a consortium called Annington Homes, which funded the acquisition with three securitised bonds totalling around 900 million stg, dealers said.</p>
<p>The MOD rental payments were guaranteed by the British government, unlike the housing association loans, and the resultant bonds carried top-notch triple-A ratings.  </p>
<p>&quot;Around 1,000 housing associations are backing these loans, not the government,&quot; said the banker involved in the bid.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of diversity in the portfolio, which reduces risk so it may still carry a high rating,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government's plans to allow private sector banks access to the student loan market could also result in a securitised bond issue, dealers said.</p>
<p>Investment Bank N M Rothschild &amp; Sons is advising the government on the possible sale of part of its 2.0 billion stg student loan portfolio.  </p>
<p>Rothschild is also advising the British government on the housing association portfolio sales.</p>
<p>But many PFI transactions are too small to merit capital market funding.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a minimum size of about 50 million stg but smaller private placements are possible,&quot; said BZW's Dale.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors in the bond market are keen to get involved for the right sort of deals,&quot; she said, adding the traditional vehicle for project financing, the loan market, often provided competetive funding.</p>
