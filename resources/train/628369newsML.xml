<title>BELGIUM: Belgian shares losses seen limited.</title>
<headline>Belgian shares losses seen limited.</headline>

<p>Belgian shares headed south with other European markets on Friday, rattled by monetary union fears, but dealers said they expected losses to be limited.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we will see big moves today. I don't see it going down a lot. The underlying sentiment on so many stocks is still bullish,&quot; one trader commented.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 leading index was 7.04 points, or 0.31 percent, lower at 2,250.74 by 0830 GMT. In contrast the CAC-40 and IBIS DAX were 1.28 and 1.30 percent lower.</p>
<p>Retailers were the main outperformers, with GIB bouncing back from losses on Thursday to rise 1.29 percent.  </p>
<p>Rival Delhaize, the most actively traded blue chip, was up five francs at 1,745 francs.</p>
<p>Insurer Royale Belge continued to be supported by the speculation about its future, trading unchanged at 10,000 francs. Rival Fortis AG, which posted strong gains earlier in the week on first quarter results, was 1.01 percent lower at 6,880 francs.</p>
<p>Chemicals group Solvay was unchanged at 21,500 francs. Next week shareholders are expected to okay a 10-for-one stock split and the week after the company is due to hold an analysts' meeting, traders said.</p>
