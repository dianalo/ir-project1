<title>CHINA: Far East bullish on LME copper and aluminium.</title>
<headline>Far East bullish on LME copper and aluminium.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-02-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Far East metal traders said on Monday they were optimistic London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices would continue their current rally, helped by tight supply in China.</p>
<p>Demand in China is set to increase in the short term, as physical supply in the country is tight, sources said.</p>
<p>Shanghai Metal Exchange figures show copper stocks at 17,524 tonnes, a level described by one Western trading source as &quot;nothing.&quot;  </p>
<p>LME copper finished Friday trading in London $38 up at $2,366 a tonne at the afternoon kerb, off the day's $2,375 high and despite a stock rise of 1,875 tonnes.</p>
<p>LME three-months copper was trading in Asia at $2,362/67 a tonne at 0330 GMT on Monday, with spreads of $76-80, a trader in Singapore said.</p>
<p>Copper is currently arriving in Shanghai at a premium of $120 a tonne, inclusive of cost and freight (C&amp;F) over the LME cash price, a trader in the city said.  </p>
<p>LME aluminium was trading in Asia at $1,625 a tonne, a Chinese trader in Hong Kong told Reuters, adding that high grade Western aluminium was commanding a premium to southern China ports, basis Singapore, of $110 C&amp;F, and to Shanghai of more than $120 a tonne c&amp;f.</p>
<p>Continued healthy demand in China, as well as a significant difference between the LME and domestic Chinese prices would help maintain upward momentum in LME aluminium, he said.</p>
<p>Aluminium on the Shanghai Metal Exchange opened up 100 yuan a tonne on Monday, at 16,100 yuan ($1,927) a tonne.</p>
