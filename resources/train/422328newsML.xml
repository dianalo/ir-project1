<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan central bank lowers '97 inflation forecast.</title>

<p>Taiwan's central bank on Wednesday revised its forecast for 1997 growth of the consumer price index to 3.0 percent from 3.31 percent, citing lower than expected inflation in January and February.  </p>
<p>&quot;Since the consumer price index in January and February came in lower than expected, we have lowered our CPI forecast to around 3.0 percent,&quot; said Chien Chi-ming, the central bank's economic research chief.</p>
<p>Until Wednesday, the central bank had doggedly resisted calls from other cabinet agencies to lower its 3.31 percent 1997 CPI forecast, saying such a revision was not realistic in view of Taiwan's slower-than-expected recovery.</p>
<p>The picture of Taiwan's economic health has improved in recent weeks, with fourth quarter gross domestic product coming in well higher than official forecasts at 6.62 percent.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, the state statistics bureau brought more encouraging news -- saying the consumer price index had risen just 2.03 percent year-on-year in February, lower than the 2.54 percent average forecast compiled in a Reuters Poll of Taiwan economists.</p>
<p>January's annual CPI rise came in even lower at 1.96, far below economists' forecast of an average 3.18 percent rise.</p>
<p>The central bank said the low-inflation trend should continue despite the gradual inflationary effects of an average nine percent price increase for domestic oil products implemented on January 1.  </p>
<p>&quot;The biggest factor contributing to inflation would be domestic oil prices,&quot; the central bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic consumer prices should continue to remain stable barring irregular psychological expectations of an increase,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Factors ensuring low inflation included falling prices for international crude oil and agricultural products, it said.</p>
