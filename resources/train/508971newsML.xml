<p>Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma will head a new commission trying to reverse problems of chronically low foreign investment, the presidential press service said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This body has been formed to ensure national policies are being formed to attract foreign investment into Ukraine's economy,&quot; a press service statement said.</p>
<p>Ukraine, whose reputation as a place for investors to avoid has been rising in recent weeks, has attracted only $1.4 billion in direct foreign investment since independence in 1991.</p>
<p>The statement said senior Ukrainian government officials and representatives of large foreign companies would participate in the commission.</p>
<p>Foreign firms' complaints about a poor investment climate in the former Soviet republic have grown louder since U.S. communications giant Motorola pulled out of a potential $500 million investment last month.</p>
<p>Motorola cited &quot;ever-changing&quot; conditions as one of the reasons for pulling out of a project to provide a GSM 900 standard mobile phone network to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Investors have complained about demands for bribes, inconsistent legislation and high taxes -- and most recently about parliaments' sudden decision this month to reverse a five-year tax holiday granted to foreign investors who started operating before 1995.</p>
<p>Kuchma has said repeatedly that Ukraine must make investment easier. Ministers forecast zero growth this year after the economy shrank by 10 percent in 1996.</p>
