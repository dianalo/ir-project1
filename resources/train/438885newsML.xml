<text>
<p>Japanese shares trading in London were flat to slightly lower on Thursday amid nervousness ahead of March futures and options expiry in Tokyo on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Stock prices in London certainly reflected the fact that people thought we've got a weaker opening (in Tokyo) tomorrow,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It has been pretty quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nikkei/Ise 50 share index finished 21.04 points lower at 1,397.64 points. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average had ended at its lowest level since February 7, shedding 282.79 points to 17,900.48.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a very nervous day ahead of the special quotation tomorrow,&quot; the trader said. &quot;The generally held view is that it will probably have a negative impact and could take the market down around 200-points at the opening. But I expect to see some bargain-hunting later in the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Among individual features, traders said they had seen buying interest in Daiwa Securities Co Ltd which was weak in Tokyo on rumours that it was being investigated by Japan's securities watchdog.</p>
<p>&quot;It was fairly strong in the morning, until a large seller came in and took it down in the afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>The shares finished at 880 yen in London, down from a Tokyo close of 900 yen.</p>
