<p>Foreign currency B shares of Shenzhen Tellus Machinery &amp; Electronics Co Ltd hit their limit-up in early morning trading on Thursday on market talk that it would post good 1996 results, traders said.</p>
<p>The share rose HK$0.36 or 9.89 percent to HK$4 on volume of 639,700 shares at 10.35 a.m. (0235 GMT).  </p>
<p>This is the second day in a row that the shares have hit their limit-up level. On Wednesday, they surged HK$0.33 to close at HK$3.64 on volume of 1.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Analysts told the Hong Kong-based newsletter China Securities Bulletin that investors were buying the shares on talk that the company had reversed losses reported for the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>The company said last August it lost 8.63 million yuan in the January-June period of 1996 against net earnings of 10.07 million yuan in the first half of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Talk is swirling around the market about Tellus bringing its 1996 results into the positive territory after an unimpressive first half,&quot; an analyst with Sun Hung Kai Investment Services in Shenzhen said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were also widespread rumours that the company would offer a three-for-10 rights issue for A shares,&quot; a stock analyst with a western bank said.</p>
<p>A company official said the firm had no plan to make a rights issue and would announce its 1996 full year results in April. She declined to give details.</p>
