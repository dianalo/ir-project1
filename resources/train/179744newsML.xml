<p>The government on Monday closed Zambia's largest university after riot police moved in to quell political unrest ahead of next week's general election.</p>
<p>Police used teargas and batons to disperse students demonstrating against a ban on a planned march to the presidential residence. They wanted to protest against the holding of a poll on November 18 which many opposition parties plan to boycott.</p>
<p>Closure of the campus followed two days of unrest in which 10 students were arrested and several people injured, including a British Airways crew whose bus was hit by rocks.</p>
<p>&quot;The University of Zambia has been closed because the atmosphere here is not conducive to academic work,&quot; the university senate said in a statement.</p>
<p>The announcement came as students armed with stones fought pitched battles with police and barricaded roads leading into the campus.</p>
<p>Traffic on a nearby highway was stopped for part of the morning as students indiscriminately pelted motorists before being driven back by teargas and baton charges.</p>
<p>The campus was later sealed off.</p>
<p>Student leaders said they wanted President Frederick Chiluba to reopen dialogue with his political opponents and possibly suspend polls until all political parties reached consensus on the rules governing the elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's riot was caused by an unwarranted attempt by police to disrupt a peaceful demonstration by students,&quot; a student leader said.</p>
<p>Seven opposition parties, including former president Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP) are boycotting the polls, which they say have been arranged to ensure that the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) remains in power.</p>
<p>The parties are opposed to a new constitution which bans some candidates, including Kaunda, from contesting the presidential race on the grounds that they are not native-born Zambians. Kaunda was the country's head of state for nearly three decades, leading Zambia to independence from Britain and ruling until Chiluba defeated him in polls in 1991.</p>
<p>Opposition parties are also unhappy with the voters' register, which omits 2.3 million of the 4.6 million eligible voters, and with state-owned media coverage of campaign, which they say favours the ruling party.</p>
<p>Western governments, many sharing opposition concerns, have cut or frozen aid to Zambia in an attempt to persuade the government to reverse contentious constitutional clauses and reopen voter registration.</p>
<p>The Chiluba government has, however, dug in its heels and says it will not be dictated to by foreign governments.</p>
