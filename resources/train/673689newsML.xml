<headline>EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS - WSC - 19-JUN.</headline>
<text>
<p>Typhoon Opal, with 105 mph winds, is approaching southern Japan. It is near 29n/134e, moving north at 20 mph. Landfall will occur within 24 hours in southern Honshu. Opal may weaken slightly before landfall, and will then accelerate northward through Japan, losing tropical characteristics. This will be a dangerous storm, likely producing wind damage, flooding, mudslides, and a damaging coastal storm surge. Opal is also a danger to shipping in the region. More...  </p>
<p>Typhoon Opal will likely cause major damage to coastal property at and east of the landfall in southern Honshu Japan. Winds up to 120 mph and a storm surge of up to 25 feet will cause this widespread and severe damage. Strong wind gusts are also possible, especially to the east of the storm track. As the system moves northward the winds will diminish but the very heavy to torrential rains will continue. Large areas of Honshu Japan can expect rains of 5 to 15 inches when this system tracks across. This will cause flooding and possible mudslides. Winds will also cause damage but not as severe as areas further south.  </p>
<p>There are no further statements at this time.</p>
