<text>
<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates were up by five basis points at 18.80 percent in early trade on Monday.</p>
<p>Analysts said secondary rates were virtually unchanged as recent demand had held steady on market expectations forthcoming data would confirm inflation was still on a downward trend.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks calm and I don't see any turbulence, because the market is liquid and the outlook for inflation data is good,&quot; a fixed-income analyst said.  </p>
<p>Banco de Mexico had no fixed timetable, but was expected to announce inflation data for the first half of June on Thursday.</p>
<p>The most recent Reuters survey MEX22 of forecasts by Mexico City financial houses revealed they expected the Consumer Price Index to rise by 0.47 percent for July 1-15.</p>
<p>Another analyst said secondary rates were stable because the peso was trading firmly on the foreign exchange market. Benchmark 48-hour contracts were 1.8 centavos firmer 7.8830/7.8860 per dollar.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper were down 40 basis points at 19.10 percent. Liquidity of 1.268 billion pesos was due to return to the system from prior central bank operations to drain market liquidity.</p>
