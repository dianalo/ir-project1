<text>
<p>Hong Kong stocks slumped in early Tuesday morning trade due to Wall Street induced caution, although trading in second line and China related issues was active on relatively high turnover, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The index is likely to move in a narrow range after Wall Street's fall,&quot; said Sean Li, associate director at Amsteel Securities.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index shed 66 points to 13,414 in early Tuesday trade, but came off an opening drop of some 115 points. Turnover was a robust HK$1.76 billion.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11.54 points to 6,549.37, pushed down by program selling late in the session.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 30-year U.S. long bond ended its Monday session unchanged at 99-13/32 to yield 6.545 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We also could see profit-taking in red chips and H shares today,&quot; said Li.</p>
<p>Red chip Shanghai Industrial, one of the market's star performers on Monday, shed HK$0.40 to HK$28.15.</p>
<p>But H shares were strong with the Hang Seng China Enterprise Index rising 1.54 percent to 972.23 in the first 40 minutes of trade.</p>
<p>Guangdong Kelon gained HK$0.225 to HK$4.875, and Qingling Motors HK$0.20 to HK$4.25.</p>
<p>Index heavyweight Shanghai Petrochemical put on HK$0.075 to HK$2.35.</p>
<p>The market's newest H share Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Co debuted on Tuesday at HK$2.20 compared to an issue price of HK$1.82. The share was holding steady at HK$2.175 in mid-morning.</p>
<p>It is the 23rd H share to be listed in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Properties led the market down. Sun Hung Kai Properties lost HK$1.00 to HK$94.50, but Henderson Land was unchanged at HK$77.75.</p>
<p>The market gave a tentative thumbs up to the company's intention, announced on Monday, to seek a secondary listing in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Finance was the next worst performing sector, due chiefly to short-term profit-taking in Hang Seng Bank. The share shed HK$1.50 to HK$93.50. Parent bank HSBC Holdings was unchanged at HK$166.00.</p>
<p>The January futures contract shed 35 points to 13,425 in the first half hour. There was no trading in the February contract.</p>
