<title>USA: Quaker's Snapple to launch 100 pct juice line.</title>
<headline>Quaker's Snapple to launch 100 pct juice line.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-18</dateline>

<p>Quaker Oats Co. said Tuesday it plans to introduce a line of 100 percent juice drinks under its Snapple brand, adding to its existing offerings of fruit-flavored and iced tea beverages.</p>
<p>&quot;We are planning on introducing some 100 percent juice products later this year,&quot; Quaker spokesman Ronald Bottrell said. &quot;We'll be making an announcement as to the specific products and the number of products. But at this point, we're not in a position to provide details.&quot;</p>
<p>The Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday that Quaker will launch a four-flavor line to be called Snapple 100 percent Juice.</p>
<p>Bottrell declined to give specifics on the new juice line.</p>
<p>&quot;We're a few weeks away from providing details to our distributors and to the public at large,&quot; he added. &quot;You'll be hearing more from us on this.&quot;</p>
<p>The new juice product line comes at a time Quaker is trying to turn Snapple around. The business has posted an operating loss since it was acquired two years ago in a $1.8 billion transaction.</p>
<p>&quot;Snapple clearly remains challenging,&quot; Quaker Chairman William Smithburg said in a letter to shareholders included in the 1996 annual report. &quot;It is a large brand with over $500 million in sales and strong consumer appeal. But in 1996, it operated at a significant loss.&quot;</p>
<p>He added the goal is to run Snapple at a cash operating profit in 1997.</p>
