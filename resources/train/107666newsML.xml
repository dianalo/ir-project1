<p>Togo is scaling down its state coffee and cocoa marketing body to boost private competition in line with donor-sponsored reforms.</p>
<p>A government statement this week invited exporters to apply for licences from the Coffee and Cocoa Coordination Committee by October 25.</p>
<p>Up to now, Togo's state produce agency (OPAT) has monopolised buying and export stabilisation by approving licence applications. OPAT is expected to slash its workforce to 30 from 350 by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Togo aims to boost coffee and cocoa output by planting 1,000 additional hectares of each between 1996 and 1998 and by rehabilitating existing plantations.</p>
<p>It produced 12,078 tonnes of coffee and 7,827 tonnes of cocoa in 1995/96 against 9,850 and 3,812 tonnes respectively in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Togo's market liberalisation aims to end state approval and licensing of buyers and exporters, to scrap commission and producer price fixing and to introduce guaranteed minimum rather than set prices for farmers.</p>
<p>The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have linked cocoa sector reforms to loan deals with several West African countries with state-controlled marketing agencies.</p>
<p>The aim is to improve marketing efficiency and transparency and raise prices paid to farmers. But there have been several problems, especially where changes were made quickly.</p>
<p>In Cameroon and Nigeria numerous inexperienced firms sprang up after liberalisation and this, coupled with relaxed quality control, led to lower bean quality and loss of premium payments.</p>
<p>Forward sales revenue was also hit because foreign buyers were reluctant to enter into such contracts.</p>
