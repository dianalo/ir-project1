<p>Profit-taking knocked the surge in newly-listed Afribrand Ltd on Monday after the firm's successful flotation last week, dealers said.</p>
<p>The stock listed at 100 cents but quickly roared higher and was further boosted when the firm issued a cautionary statement saying it was in talks on possible deals.</p>
<p>&quot;Some guys are just cashing in,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The firm's stock dropped to a day low of 264 cents, but recovered some ground by 0745 GMT to stand unchanged at 280 cents.</p>
<p>However, dealers said there was still a lot of firm market demand for the stock.</p>
<p>Stephen Weir, Afribrand's chief executive, last week declined to say how many possible purchases the lower-income confectionary to snacks firm was eyeing, but squashed market rumours that it could be as many as 20.</p>
<p>He said it was hoped that discussions would be finalised in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We had one or two discussions and then the prospectus came out and then we had to stop. We are bringing our discussions back again,&quot; he said.</p>
