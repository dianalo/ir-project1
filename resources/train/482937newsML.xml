<title>USA: Hamas leader seeks release from U.S. prison.</title>
<headline>Hamas leader seeks release from U.S. prison.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>By Gail Appleson, U.S. Law Correspondent</p>
<p>An imprisoned political leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas should be released because the U.S. government has failed to extradite him to Israel, his lawyer argued on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In January, Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook gave up his fight against extradition from the United States. His lawyer, Michael Kennedy, argued during a hearing in Manhattan federal court that federal law required the U.S. government to surrender him to Israel or release him no later than March 28.</p>
<p>Kennedy and federal prosecutors disagree on when a two-month time limitation began after Marzook's decision to drop his appeal of an extradition order. Prosecutors say the deadline is April 6.</p>
<p>Last year a federal judge ordered Abu Marzook extradited to Israel and another judge confirmed the ruling in October. Although Abu Marzook initially appealed the rulings, his lawyers withdrew the appeal on Jan. 28.</p>
<p>It is believed that Israeli and American officials have been trying to find ways to avoid extraditing Abu Marzook to Israel out of fear it would lead to violence.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss told the court that Marzook's extradition is a sensitive matter and that Israel wants all the time to which it is entitled.</p>
<p>&quot;It is no secret this request for extradition is now complicated by the ongoing peace process,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ordered the two sides to submit briefs on the matter and set the next hearing tentatively for Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably the first case in the annals of United States extradition practice where a person is ordered extradited and is willing to be extradited and the government refuses to extradite or release him for political reasons, preferring instead to keep him confined in perpetual limbo in federal jail,&quot; Marzook's petition for release states.</p>
<p>In 1995 Israel announced it had formally asked the United States to hand over Abu Marzook, alleging he was responsible as the head of Hamas's political arm for attacks that killed scores of Israelis.</p>
<p>Israel did not contend that Abu Marzook personally committed any of the violent acts, but charged he was criminally liable because of his high-level role in allegedly directing, controlling and financially supporting Hamas's activities.</p>
<p>Abu Marzook has denied involvement in any violence.</p>
<p>He was arrested on July 25, 1995, at a New York airport as he flew to the United States -- where he had lived for many years -- after immigration officials found his name on its &quot;watch list&quot; of people with &quot;known or suspected ties to terrorist activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel had requested his arrest and his extradition, alleging that the U.S.-educated Gazan was involved in a number of fatal bombings, shootings and stabbings between 1990 and 1994 and has raised money for and controlled the leadership of the military wing of Hamas.</p>
<p>Abu Marzook has a home and business in Virginia, but U.S. and Israeli authorities charged he frequently travelled to the Middle East to promote violence and undermine peace efforts.</p>
