<headline>NFL AMERICAN FOOTBALL-FORMER NFL COMMISSIONER PETE ROZELLE DIES.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Former National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who guided the NFL through a period of meteoric growth in popularity and prosperity, died on Friday. He was 70 years old.</p>
<p>Rozelle, who had been treated for brain cancer in recent years, died at his California home.</p>
<p>During nearly three decades as commissioner, Rozelle created the Super Bowl and Monday Night Football, forged a merger with the rival American Football League and instituted a revolutionary plan for television revenue sharing that helped turn the league into a model sports empire.</p>
<p>Under Rozelle's innovative leadership, the NFL grew from 12 to 28 teams before his surprise retirement in 1989, when he was succeeded by current commissioner Paul Tagliabue.</p>
