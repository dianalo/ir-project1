<title>FRANCE: INSTANT VIEW - French Jan consumer spending rise.</title>
<headline>INSTANT VIEW - French Jan consumer spending rise.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-02-26</dateline>

<p>Following are analysts' comments on the 1.9 percent rise in consumer spending on manufactured goods in January versus December, as reported by national statistics institute INSEE on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of 11 economists on Monday produced an average forecast of a 0.8 percent rise, helped by winter discount sales in January. INSEE revised the December figures to show a fall of 1.3 percent compared to a previous 0.8 percent fall.</p>
<p>PHILIPPE BROSSARD, ECONOMIST, ABN AMRO</p>
<p>This is a strong number. We're starting the first quarter with a very strong number on the demand side. A 0.2 percent INSEE growth forecast for the first quarter of 1997 looks too pessimistic, I think it could perhaps come in at 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>We already knew car sales would continue to decline. The retail sector compensated. But seasonal sales started later than usual, on January 2. They sometimes start at the end of December, so this time this may explain the strong January number and the weak December one.  </p>
<p>MICHALA MARCUSSEN, ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE</p>
<p>This was very much in line with what we expected. A lot of it is because the sales period was pushed forward this year.</p>
<p>Overall consumption remains fairly weak. The situation remains so very depressed on the labour market, consumer sentiment remains depressed. I do not see why the economy should pick up unless there is a positive impact from the tax reform.</p>
<p>DAVID NAUDE, ECONOMIST, JP MORGAN.</p>
<p>First of all its good news...it's clearly showing that the slide that took place in the fourth quarter has now come to an end.</p>
<p>The revision (to December) and the January bounce tell us the profile was very hectic and very marked in the fourth quarter, supporting the view there will be a big bounce in the first quarter this year.</p>
<p>It doesn't tell us much about growth and genuine pickup, here we're seeing a recovery and we'll have to wait for the second quarter. But it's a sound reversal, coming quickly and robustly.</p>
<p>The breakdown is good. We knew auto sales would fall, the question was what would non-auto sales do -- they were up 4.4 percent.</p>
