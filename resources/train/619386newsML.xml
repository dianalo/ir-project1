<p>Bordeaux's French international midfielder Ibrahim Ba is to join AC Milan next season, sources close to his club said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two clubs reached an agreement for a four-year contract and a 45 million francs (around $7.8 million) transfer fee but the deal had yet to be finalised, the sources said.</p>
<p>Ba joined Bordeaux last year from Le Havre. He enjoyed a successful season, helping his club end fourth in the league and playing his first three matches for the national team.</p>
<p>French coach Aime Jacquet included him in his squad of 22 for the Tournoi de France four-team tournament starting on June 3.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm relieved that everything has been settled before the Tournoi de France,&quot; he said. &quot;That will allow me to be more relaxed while playing for France.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dakar-born Ba said he was aware that it would be tough for him to become a first choice player at AC Milan.</p>
<p>&quot;I realise that it will not be easy but I'm looking forward to it,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a dream come true.&quot;</p>
<p>The powerful and gifted Ba had received offers from other leading European clubs including Barcelona and Arsenal.</p>
