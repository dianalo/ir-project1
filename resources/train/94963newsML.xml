<title>FRANCE: French doctors to refuse night calls in protest.</title>
<headline>French doctors to refuse night calls in protest.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-10-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>French doctors threatened on Thursday to leave their telephones off the hook for one night to protest against plans to cut extra payment for night home calls.</p>
<p>Five unions representing most general practitioners called on members to refuse home calls overnight Thursday-Friday after the government said they would be entitled to extra payment only between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m, instead of 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. as now.</p>
<p>Unions say about half of the country's 55,000 general practitioners take turns for night duty. Doctors charge 300 francs ($60) for nightime home calls compared with 135 francs ($27) for daytime calls.</p>
<p>The government decision is part of a package of measures to trim the snowballing losses of the state welfare system as it struggles to cut the state deficit in order to join a European single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Unions said they expected most doctors in the biggest towns and half in the rest of the country to heed their call.</p>
<p>In order to avoid leaving patients unattended, calls to practitioners on night duty will be transferred to emergency services.</p>
<p>A separate five-day-old strike by train drivers over working conditions, which badly disrupted commuter traffic in Paris' eastern suburbs, was set to end on Thursday after the protesters voted to return to work.</p>
<p>They said their demands had been partly satisfied and negotiations would resume with the management of the SNCF state railway company.</p>
