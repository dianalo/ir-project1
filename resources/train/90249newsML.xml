<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends with sharply pared gains.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends with sharply pared gains.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee prices ended marginally higher Wednesday but well off their intraday peak, after persistent selling from the producing sector wiped out the market's early gains, trading sources said.</p>
<p>Both speculators and commercial operators were steady buyers at the open, as a swift, early rally activated buy stops above 105.25 cents on the nearby December contract. Commodity funds then took up the charge, lifting December to a three-week high of 108 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;We rallied on roaster follow-through interest this morning, but the bulk of the aggressive buying was done by the specs,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>But origins were quick to capitalize on the higher prices once the buying momentum stalled, knocking the market back toward unchanged ahead of the closing bell.</p>
<p>December delivery rose 0.65 cent a lb, to 105.40, while second-position March gained 0.20 cent, to 100.80.</p>
<p>Volume on the day was steady, at an estimated 9,027 lots.  </p>
<p>In addition to what many said was an improving technical outlook, traders attributed this morning's run-up to bullish stock figures released earlier this week. Coffee stored in exchange warehouses fell to a 12-year low of 31,669 bags as of September 27, the CSCE reported on Monday.</p>
<p>While shipments of the new 1996/97 crop from Latin America are expected to slowly replenish the certified cache, dealers said concern over near-term supplies has given a sharp boost to the nearby switch in recent days. December-March swelled to 4.60 cents at Wednesday's close, from 4.15 the previous day.</p>
<p>Technically, December's early move through 107.25 cents was viewed as technically constructive, but stiff resistance loomed at 110 cents. To the downside, 104.50 and 100.00 cents were crucial support levels.</p>
