<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-TIKKANEN GOAL IN OT LIFTS CANUCKS PAST OILERS.</headline>
<dateline>EDMONTON 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Esa Tikkanen scored his second goal of the game 42 seconds into overtime on Friday to lift the Vancouver Canucks to their third straight win, 5-4 over the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
<p>Pavel Bure had the puck at the right boards before passing to Tikkanen behind the Edmonton goal. Tikkanen skated to the left goalpost and flipped a backhander that hit Edmonton defenceman Bryan Marchment's skate before landing just inside the right post.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a game that had a little of everything,&quot; said Vancouver coach Ton Renney. &quot;We didn't play real well, but we played real hard and didn't quit.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a game that we may be able to look back on as a turning point in our season. We have been looking for a game that we could pin our identity as a team to and this effort is something I'd love for us to show every night.&quot;</p>
<p>Mike Ridley had tied the score 4-4 for Vancouver with 1:25 left in regulation. Chris Joseph and Alexander Mogilny also scored for Vancouver.</p>
<p>Vancouver goaltender Corey Hirsch stopped 35 shots and has made three straight starts since missing almost three weeks with a chest injury.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a difficult game for both goalies,&quot; Hirsch said. &quot;The game was up and down the rink, pucks flying from everywhere and taking funny bounces.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;All in all, life is good. We won the game and nothing else really mattered.&quot;</p>
<p>Boris Mironov and Jason Arnott each had a goal and an assist for the Oilers. Andrei Kovalenko and Todd Marchant also tallied for Edmonton.</p>
<p>In Dallas, Jeff Shantz scored 1:48 into overtime to give the Chicago Blackhawks a 3-2 win over the Stars.</p>
<p>Chicago defenceman Chris Chelios picked up a loose puck just outside the blue line and shot from the high right point. Andy Moog made a chest save, but the rebound bounced in front to Shantz, who chipped a shot over Moog's shoulder.</p>
<p>Chicago took a one-goal lead 6:02 into the third period when Denis Savard split defenders Todd Harvey and Grant Ledyard and fired a wrist shot in.</p>
<p>Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock called a timeout to calm his team down and the tactic worked. Jere Lehtinen poked home a rebound of a loose puck 52 seconds later.</p>
<p>In Anaheim, Teemu Selanne completed his ninth career hat trick by scoring twice in a 2:23 span in the third period as the Mighty Ducks broke their eight-game losing streak with a 4-3 victory over the San Jose Sharks.</p>
<p>Paul Kariya helped set up Selanne's last two goals, notching his first points of the season.</p>
<p>Sharks defenceman Al Iafrate scored his first two goals since 1994. Iafrate was shelved for the entire 1994-95 and 1995-96 seasons, tearing up both of his knees.</p>
<p>In Calgary, Jeremy Roenick picked an opportune time to get his first goal of the season -- with 52 seconds left in overtime -- as the Phoenix Coyotes beat the Flames 3-2.</p>
<p>Roenick took advantage of a turnover in the Calgary zone and rifled a wrist shot from the left faceoff circle, beating Rick Tabaracci to the stick side. Roenick's goal was his first for the Coyotes in eight games, following a protracted holdout that forced a trade from the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>
<p>Calgary rallied from an early 2-0 deficit, tying the game on rookie Jarome Iginla's power play goal 4:20 into the third period.</p>
<p>The Coyotes, formerly the Winnipeg Jets, have won five straight meetings with the Flames.</p>
<p>In St Louis, rookies Barrie Moore and Curtis Brown scored 1:41 apart early in the third period as the Buffalo Sabres rallied for a 4-2 victory to hand the Blues their fourth straight loss.</p>
<p>Moore, in his fourth NHL game and first of the season, scored his first career goal, a power-play marker 2:43 into the third period, to get the Sabres into a 2-2 tie. Brown gave Buffalo the lead for good.</p>
<p>Dominik Hasek made 33 saves as Buffalo won for the fifth time in its last seven games.</p>
<p>At Washington, Joe Juneau notched the second hat trick of his career, scoring three times on special teams, and Jason Allison had three assists as the Capitals left the stymied Pittsburgh Penguins winless on the road with a 4-2 victory.</p>
<p>The Penguins fell to 2-9 this season -- 0-8 on the road -- and their four points are the lowest in the league.</p>
<p>The Capitals, following a 1-5 start, have won four of their last five games.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Radek Bonk and Alexandre Daigle scored 5:08 apart in the third period as the Ottawa Senators rallied for a 2-2 tie with the Red Wings to remain unbeaten at home.</p>
<p>The Senators (3-3-5) improved to 2-0-3 at home while Detroit ran its unbeaten streak to seven games (5-0-2).</p>
