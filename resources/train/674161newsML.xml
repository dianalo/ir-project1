<headline>INSTANT VIEW - Jospin speech - political reaction.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-06-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following are immediate reactions from politicians and other commentators to French Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's maiden policy speech on Thursday.</p>
<p>FRANCOIS D'AUBERT, UDF (centre right opposition party):</p>
<p>What's going to happen to reform of the social security system, the privatisation of France Telecom?...there are more question marks than answers.  </p>
<p>PHILIPPE SEGUIN, RPR FLOOR LEADER (centre-right opposition party):</p>
<p>The answers you (Jospin) propose are not convincing. It is obvious that you will not be counting on our vote.</p>
<p>We are witnessing a triple revolution -- globalisation, the rise in power of the financial sphere and a technoligical explosion. There are no ready-made and simple solutions.</p>
<p>Without growth nothing will be resolved. We made grave and costly errors. We must move from assistance to integration. We do not see your analysis living up to this.</p>
<p>You have not done away with the answers of the past.  </p>
<p>ALAIN BOCQUET, FLOOR LEADER, COMMUNISTS (coalition party):</p>
<p>Allow me say I regret that the rise (in the minimum wage) is limited to four percent. I would have liked a bit more.</p>
<p>Moving towards a 35-hour week without a reduction in salary is a response to modern times which we share.</p>
<p>All the privatisations launched by the right should be halted.</p>
<p>Is it not time to undo the vicegrip of the financial markets by taxing capital movements?</p>
<p>Quadrupling the wealth tax would add a lacking dimension.  </p>
<p>MARC BLONDEL, LEADER OF FORCE OUVRIERE TRADE UNION:</p>
<p>I was struck by the prime minister's speech which I would describe as republican and social overall. That's to say that he tried to show that the government's desire was to change things profoudly. I think that in the social domain he made advances which are not negligable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I see some hazy or worrying aspects.</p>
<p>Notably on the SMIC (minumum wage). Is it (a rise of) four percent that will not be followed by other steps, especially at the conference (on wages, work times and employment which start in September). I didn't hear talk of the need to negotiate salaries at sectoral level.</p>
<p>On cutting work time, I see that he is putting the deadline for a 35-hour week back to five years.</p>
<p>He is trying through various measures to stimulate spending power and I think that's a good move. But I have some questions about boosting economic activity, above all if big public works are stopped and...social security problems where he skated over the question. He was not very precise about a possible reform of the Juppe (social security reform) plan.</p>
