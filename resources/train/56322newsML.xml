<p>Greek equities rallied on Monday, continuing their advance for the fifth consecutive day in heavy trading volume of 11.9 billion drachmas. Brokers said a bullish outlook and positioning was behind the broad-based advance.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a very strong market today and it looks that it wants to continue this way with investors discounting several positive developments ahead. Briefly, a strong government and measures that will boost the economy,&quot; said Lambros Papaconstadinou, managing Director of P &amp; K Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The heavy trading volumes are clear evidence of positioning and we expect to have a good market until year end, led to a great extent by the banking sector. We may see some nervousness towards the end of this week as we head for election day,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The two lead candidates for prime minister, socialist Costas Simitis and conservative Miltiadis Evert, faced off in a TV debate Friday evening hoping to lure the undecided voters in what the press has dubbed the &quot;couch elections&quot;.</p>
<p>Many analysts called it a draw with no winning punches and no major gaffes by either candidate.</p>
<p>Greece will hold early elections September 22.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed 1.67 percent, or 16.01 points higher at 974.20 from Friday's 958.19 close after opening at 961.75 points. Turnover rose to 11.9 billion drachmas from 9.5 billion on Friday on volume of 4.85 million shares.</p>
<p>Advancers led decliners 157 to 66 with 22 issues unchanged on 245 traded. Banks climbed 1.90 percent, industrials jumped 2.18 percent and construction advanced 1.06 percent. Small-caps gained 1.08 percent.</p>
