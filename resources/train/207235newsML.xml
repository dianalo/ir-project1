<headline>Miss World, police, protesters rehearse for final.</headline>
<dateline>BANGALORE, India 1996-11-21</dateline>

<p>Thursday in Bangalore was dress rehearsal day for 88 would-be Miss Worlds and thousands of policemen assigned to safeguard the beauty pageant against violent protests.</p>
<p>&quot;The countdown begins today,&quot; one police inspector told Reuters at the southern Indian city's Chinnaswammy cricket stadium where Miss World will be crowned on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The question most people are asking is where Kinay Narayan Shashikala, the woman threatening to lead a suicide squad to commit self immolation among the audience, will be when the three-hour show is on.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan, the Hindi superstar whose company holds the rights to stage this year's event, made an appeal for reason at a packed news conference at the stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ready to hold talks with them even now,&quot; the man known as Big B, and friend of assassinated leader Rajiv Gandhi, said.</p>
<p>Julia Morley, international president of Miss World Ltd, has already tried and failed to talk to Shashikala and others.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very upsetting I appeal to them to protest peacefully,&quot; Bachchan said, referring to Shashikala and her followers in the Mahila Jagran Samiti (Forum to Awaken Women).</p>
<p>Police chiefs and Karnataka state Home Minister Roshan Baig are confident the 10,000-plus mix of police and paramilitary officers will be able to stop any trouble spoiling the show.</p>
<p>An estimated two billion television viewers are expected to watch Miss World, which has been touted as a showcase for India.</p>
<p>Shashikala has been under police surveillance, and junior police officers told Reuters they expected that she and her followers would be picked-up before the show begins as a safeguard.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the arena, where 20,000 people are expected watch Saturday's final, bomb squads and sniffer dogs scoured the site for unwanted packages.</p>
<p>While the Miss World troupe was busy turning heads, in the streets outside some young activists practised stopping traffic in preparation for a bigger demonstration on Saturday.</p>
<p>The activist youth wing of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) tried to block roads in at least three parts of the city and march on the stadium before being dispersed.</p>
<p>The BJP leader in Karnataka state Assembly B.S. Yediyurappa has already called for a strike on Saturday aimed at bringing the city to a standstill.</p>
<p>The plan is to block routes into the stadium.</p>
<p>Yediyuruppa appealed on Wednesday to Shashikala to withdraw her threat of multiple suicides, but the second-year law student and self-defence instructor replied that she would go ahead unless the BJP rally succeeded in halting the show.</p>
<p>Another BJP state deputy Pramila Nesargi plans to hold a Miss Poverty show outside the venue, offering food and clothing to thousands of poor.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 people are expected to pay between 1,900 rupees and 25,000 rupees ($53 to $700) to watch an extravaganza involving more than 500 performers, plus elephants, and the 88 women.</p>
<p>Price aside, drawbacks include a ban on alcohol, a de facto ban on smoking if cigarette lighters are confiscated, and instructions for ticketholders to pass through the gates at least two hours before the show starts.</p>
