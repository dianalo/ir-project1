<headline>OPTIONS - US debt volatilities ebb after PPI rally.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatilities for U.S. debt options were generally softer as the underlying markets bounced from their early lows on an unexpected drop in April producer price index (PPI), dealers said.</p>
<p>But the rally soon faded into relatively narrow range-trade, putting option pricing levels under pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation figures are definitely not showing any pickup in inflation,&quot; said a T-bond option trader at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). He added that bonds looked toppish, however, and expected more sideways trading ahead of Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.  </p>
<p>Implied volatility for CBOT July T-bond futures options was steady at 8.7 percent, while September was off 0.1 point at 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>There was sporadic 1,000-lot buying in July 110 and 111 calls, reflecting optimism growing ahead of the FOMC meeting, but volume was light overall.</p>
<p>April PPI fell by 0.6 percent overall against Wall Street forecasts for an unchanged level and March's 0.1 percent decline. The core PPI excluding food and energy fell 0.1 percent, compared with estimates of a 0.1 percent gain and a 0.4 percent rise in March.  </p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the relatively large decline in PPI solidifies the attitude that...any (Fed) actions taken are going to be minimal,&quot; said John Nyhoff, vice president and chief economist at Tokyo Mitsubishi Futures.</p>
<p>&quot;The Eurodollar curve is already pricing-in a moderate degree of tightening by year-end and there's anticipation the market is going to contunue to fluctuate in the trading ranges it has established over the last couple of months,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Implied volatilities for September and December Eurodollar futures options slipped about 0.2 point each to 9.4 and 11.5 percent respectively.  </p>
<p>Nyhoff noted that most Eurodollar traders preferred being short options, despite the event risk for the FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk-reward trade-off right now do not favor being long volatility, long gamma positions,&quot; he said, citing as an example the September 94.00 straddle, whose premium stood at about 27 basis points (bps).</p>
<p>He said even the most bearish camp in the market was expecting a tightening of 50 bps by September, which would probably bring down the settlement price of September futures at their expiration by about 25 bps below the current level near 93.90.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you sell that thing (the 94.00 straddle) and the Fed tightens, you really don't have very much risk,&quot; he said. &quot;If they only tighten 25 you stand to make a lot of money, and if they don't tighten you also stand to make a little money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems the safer posture at this point is to be short gamma and short volatility,&quot; he added.</p>
