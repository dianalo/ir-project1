<p>The Malawi government said on Monday it was struggling to reach more than 30,000 people still trapped by floods in two districts.</p>
<p>Commissioner for Relief and Rehabilitation Lucius Chikuni told Reuters many homes were still inaccessible in Chikwawa and Nsanje districts, about 40 km (25 miles) south of the commerical capital Blantyre, after heavy flooding in February.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't guarantee we have been able to reach everybody. In some areas it is inaccessible. Between seven and 10 percent of the victims have not been covered,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chikuni said flood damage covers stretches of land of more than 50 km (32 miles) in each of the two districts and had affected around 375,000 people.</p>
<p>In some cases the victims can only be reached by canoe, he added.</p>
<p>Response to a government appeal for aid had been poor and around 11,000 tonnes of maize was still needed to feed victims, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much food. We only have 3,000 tonnes of maize. We have a shortfall of 11,000 tonnes. Where this is going to come from we don't know,&quot; Chikuni said.</p>
<p>He said the government had halted flights of three army helicopters deployed to airdrop food to victims because they were too expensive to operate.</p>
<p>&quot;The choppers were stopped because they were too expensive. We spent 100,000 kwacha ($6,000) a day. We could not continue to spend that kind of money,&quot; Chikuni said.</p>
<p>($=15.200 kwacha)</p>
