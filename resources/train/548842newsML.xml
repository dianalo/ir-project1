<headline>Jakarta exchange suspends Elang Realty.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-04-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Jakarta Stock Exchange suspended the trading in shares of property firm PT Elang Realty after it fell sharply in late morning trade on Tuesday, an exchange official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have halted the trading in Elang Realty,&quot; a Jakarta Stock Exchange official told Reuters. He said the exchange would conduct an investigation before taking any further decision.</p>
<p>He said the exchange decided to halt the trading to prevent Elang from declining further as its share price had fallen about 30.43 percent since the market opened on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Elang Realty was the most active stock, with about 68.7 million shares changing hands. It fell 525 rupiah to 1,200 after touching a high of 1,875 rupiah earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Brokers said Elang had been actively traded since last week on market talk of a possible rights issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard Elang prices would manage to stabilise at around 1,800 rupiah today ahead of its rumoured rights issue. The rumours boosted sentiment on the stock,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;But what happened just now (fall in Elang prices) has put presssure on overall market sentiment,&quot; he added.</p>
