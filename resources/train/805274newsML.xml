<p>Slovak short-term interbank rates on Monday traded at between 21-23 percent, up from 18 percent on Friday, but dealers said they did not expect any significant fluctuation over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Traders said Friday's decline was a regular short-term move at the end of every minimum reserves requirement (PMR) period and that rates normally climb back to above 20 percent at the beginning of a new PMR period.</p>
<p>The Slovak banking sector last week, for the second consecutive time, met its PMR set by the central bank (NBS), this time without any funds borrowed from the NBS through its repo operations.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see what amount will leave after the auctions of state bonds and treasury bills this week, but I do not expect any radical moves with rates in the current PMR period,&quot; said Rastislav Zivor of ING Bank.</p>
<p>Traders predict rates will find a floor at around 19 percent with a ceiling at around 24 percent during the current PMR period.</p>
<p>Interbank rates have been hovering above 20 percent over the past two months after the NBS tightened money market liquidity in order to protect the crown against speculative attacks in May and June.</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment seems to be that even the central bank likes rates at around their present levels, so dramatic fluctuations are unlikely,&quot; said another Bratislava-based foreign bank dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the need to refinance a growing state budget deficit with tax-free yields of 18 to 20 percent at state securities auctions will provide strong support for interbank rates and will keep them above 20 percent in the near future.</p>
<p>The budget deficit widened to 17.936 billion crowns for the first seven months of this year from 13.209 billion in the January-June period of 1997.</p>
