<p>Anglo-Yugoslav Bank Ltd, the London-based bank with majority stake held by Yugoslavia's Beogradska Banka, said on Friday it was considering new business strategy to strengthen its European activities.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering the new organisation of the European Union, the bank mulls a possibility to pool funds held abroad (from other Beogradska banka joint stock banks) and form new banking units in all EU member countries,&quot; said Ljubisa Igic, newly appointed head of Anglo-Yugoslav Bank.</p>
<p>Beogradska banka is a majority shareholder in four other joint stock banks in Europe, including Banque Franco-Yougoslave in Paris, Adria Bank in Vienna, LHB Internationale Handelsbank AG in Frankfurt and Societe Generale -Yugoslav Bank in Belgrade.</p>
<p>&quot;The strategy of pooling funds from all those banks into one would help increase capital and establish new clientele not burdened with old debts,&quot; Igic told a news conference.</p>
<p>According to Igic, funds could be pooled into Anglo-Yugoslav Bank.</p>
<p>Another part of the bank's future strategy was &quot;to become an agent in attracting and securing finances for Yugoslavia's economic revival,&quot; Igic said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank could also become an agent in restructuring (Yugoslav) external debt,&quot; he said, but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>For that purpose, Anglo-Yugoslav needed permission from the National Bank of Yugoslavia, he added.</p>
<p>The third direction would be for the bank to increase its payment and credit operations but also to become more active in collecting claims from Yugoslavia's debtors.</p>
<p>Anglo-Yugoslav is a joint stock bank, with Beogradska Banka holding a majority 54.06 percent stake.</p>
<p>Other shareholders include Metalchem International Limited, Yugoslavia's Vojvodjanska Banka, Jugobanka and Montenegrobanka, Croatia's Privredna Banka Zagreb, and Stopanska Banka, Almako company and Almako Banka from Macedonia.</p>
<p>Anglo-Yugoslav Bank reported a 1,113,000 pounds sterling operating profit before debt provisions in 1996, down from 2,094,000 pounds in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The retained profit for the year amounted to 1,302,000 pounds and has been transferred to reserves. The directors recommended that no dividend be paid for the year, the bank's annual report said. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
