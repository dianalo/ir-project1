<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Monday called a meeting between Federal and state governments to discuss a new court decision extending Aboriginal land title.</p>
<p>&quot;Arrangements have been made today for a meeting in Sydney on Wednesday morning with state premiers and the chief minister of the Northern Territory to discuss native title issues in th wake of the High Court decision in the Wik case,&quot; Howard said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The High Court, Australia's supreme tribunal, first created and then, in the 1996 Wik case, extended traditional Aboriginal ownership of land, creating one of Australia's most difficult political problems.</p>
<p>Before the 1992 Mabo case, it was assumed that the Crown owned all land upon Australia's first settlement in 1788, and for more than 200 years it was bought and sold accordingly.</p>
<p>But that case ruled that Aborigines might still own traditional land, providing the Crown had not sold to someone else.  </p>
<p>Since continuing Aboriginal connection with the land was required, the decision affected mostly rural and outback areas.</p>
<p>Last month's Wik case extended native title by declaring that it might still exist even if the Crown had leased the land, notably to pastoralists.</p>
<p>Many of Australia's mining leases are also on former or existing pastoral leases.</p>
<p>Primary producers have demanded that the government legislate to limit or eliminate native title, giving them the certainty over land title they say they have lost.  </p>
<p>But such legislation would mean bluntly denying property rights to Aborigines, and both the former Labor government and the current Liberal-National administration have been reluctant to move so far.</p>
