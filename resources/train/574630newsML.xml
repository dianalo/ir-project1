<p>* NZ short rates break above 7 pct after RBNZ comment</p>
<p>* RBNZ says would prefer to see monetary conditions firmer</p>
<p>* TWI rises 30 basis points from opening level</p>
<p>New Zealand short rates pushed up above seven percent on Monday morning after the Reserve Bank said in a surprise statement it would prefer to see monetary conditions firm somewhat.</p>
<p>The key 90-day bank bill rate shot to 7.02 percent from 6.90 percent just before the comment, while the currency's Trade-Weighted Index, previously languishing around 67.65, climbed sharply to 68.10.  </p>
<p>Acting Chief Manager of the Reserve Bank's Financial Markets Department, Michael Reddell, said that overall monetary conditions appeared to be settling at levels somewhat too low to be consistent with the intended stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Our desired stance of policy was enunciated at the time of the Bank's March Economic Projections, and reaffirmed by the Governor in his comments at the Finance and Expenditure select committee last Wednesday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To be consistent with this stance, we would prefer to see conditions firm somewhat, to levels rather closer to the announced desired conditions.&quot;  </p>
<p>Up until the statement volumes in the debt market had been extremely thin.</p>
<p>Dealers said the statement had caught the market completely off-guard.</p>
<p>Conditions have eased substantially in the past fortnight after an interview Reserve Bank governor Don Brash gave, where he indicated the bank was reviewing the appropriateness of its assumed monetary conditions, ahead of its June monetary policy statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market believed he was talking about an easing of sorts, but now the Reserve Bank has come back and said at the moment it doesn't believe an easing is called for,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He commented that the TWI had been pushed up to where the RBNZ wanted it. The central bank in its March economic projections assumed the TWI at 68.0 and 90-day bank bills at 7.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;With the TWI where they want it that's a good start, but I don't see the 90-days getting to 7.5 percent, which is where they want them. I don't see that as an option,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>He expressed surprise at the timing of the statement, as the TWI had softened to 67.65 largely on the back of U.S. dollar movements over the weekend, and perhaps would have righted itself.</p>
<p>&quot;The RB could have waited a couple of days, to see if that had come back. It is a little bit premature, I think.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps the weakness in the kiwi dollar overnight caused the alarm bells to ring,&quot; he said.</p>
