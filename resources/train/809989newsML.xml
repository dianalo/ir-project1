<p>Belgian linear bonds barely noticed any downward pressure from the OLO exchange auction later on Tuesday and were pulled higher by Bunds following good July M3 data, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;M3 were better than expected, now a German rate rise has again become more unlikely,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;Economically speaking it just would not make any sense,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 10-year OLO/Bund yield spread was unchanged at nine basis points.</p>
<p>Today's meeting of the U.S. policy making Federal Open Market Committee was not a factor to be reckoned with, he added.  </p>
<p>One dealer said the 2002 and 2003 area was slightly affected by the prospect of the exchange auction today and regular monthly auction next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people are perhaps already selling a bit because they are confident of getting the paper back during the exchange,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He noted the OLO yield curve stubbornly refused to steepen despite the decreased pressure from the dollar. &quot;There are still worries about whether (the dollar) will rise again,' he said.</p>
