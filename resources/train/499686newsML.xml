<p>Stuffed to the rafters, Hong Kong's hotels will bid farewell to the British and herald a new era of Chinese rule with a series of extravaganzas, gourmet banquets and strawberry tea parties, hoteliers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>For the past five years, bookings have been flooding into Hong Kong's plush hotels where occupancy rates are set to top 90 percent and most hotels on Hong Kong Island are fully sold out.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no dull moments in Hong Kong,&quot; James Lu, executive director of the Hong Kong Hotels Association told Reuters. &quot;It will be five days of holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>Colonial and Chinese themes will dominate gourmet hotel banquets and parties for which diners are paying exorbitant prices to live out the final moments of British rule in high style.</p>
<p>The Regent Hotel on the Kowloon peninsula will be rolling the two themes into one at its June 30 handover party, with a tribute to former British colonies up until midnight, then a change to a Chinese theme as the red flag of China is hoisted.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be spectacular,&quot; said public relations director Carole Klein.</p>
<p>&quot;At midnight, after a dramatic countdown, the party will change to a Chinese theme and then the next day it changes to salute Chinese provinces,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ritz Carlton said it will be busy organising the biggest week of entertainment in its history.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's prestigious Peninsula Hotel will be offering traditional afternoon tea followed by a gala dinner. &quot;The whole hotel will be full of music and dancing,&quot; said public relations director Sian Griffiths.</p>
<p>The hotel received its first room booking for the handover period in 1988 and was fully booked by 1994, she said.</p>
<p>About 26 percent of Hong Kong's hotel room capacity, or 8,000 hotel rooms, remain available in Hong Kong for the handover period, mostly in Kowloon, said Lu.</p>
<p>He expected them to be fully booked by May.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people that have done business with Hong Kong in the past would like to be back here for this historical moment,&quot; said Gerhard Hecker, the general manager of the Grand Stanford Harbour View hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;Others see it as a bit of a party time -- kind of jet-setting society that likes to be at places where something special happens. And we have a lot of journalists in town.&quot;</p>
<p>Around 4,000 journalists from more than 350 news organisations have applied to the Hong Kong government for accreditation to cover the handover to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>The Grand Stanford is also planning a night of dinner and dancing and giveaway souvenirs to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>At the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong hotel, which adjoins the Hong Kong Convention Centre -- the venue for the official handover ceremony -- the mood may be a little more sombre.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little bit like New Year's Eve except you have to be a bit careful because it is not really a celebration per se,&quot; said general manager David Udell.</p>
<p>&quot;Our situation is a bit unique perhaps because of our connection to the Convention Centre so we have a lot of senior delegations from various countries that are here.</p>
<p>&quot;We are having banquets and all the restaurant dancing, just trying to make a majestic and memorable thing,&quot; he said.</p>
