<p>Boston's Mayor Thomas Menino was recovering in hospital and in good condition Thursday after being diagnosed with a kidney stone problem, officials said.</p>
<p>Menino, 53, went immediately to Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital with stomach pains Tuesday after arriving back in Boston from President Clinton's inauguration in Washington, his press secretary Jacque Goddard said.</p>
<p>He spent Tuesday and Wednesday nights in the hospital and was expected to stay Thursday night too, a hospital spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;He's still in good condition,&quot; said Esther Carver, a spokeswoman for the hospital. &quot;Medication to dissolve the kidney stone has been prescribed.&quot;</p>
<p>The mayor took office in 1993 and is up for re-election this year.</p>
<p>Menino hopes he will be in good enough condition to fly to New Orleans to see the New England Patriots play in Super Bowl XXXI against the Green Bay Packers, the spokeswoman said.</p>
