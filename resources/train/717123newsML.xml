<p>Lakshmi Mittal, one of Britain's wealthiest businessman who made a fortune out of turning around loss-making steel companies worldwide, is planning a $2.8 billion stock market flotation.</p>
<p>Sources close to the issue said on Wednesday that Indian-born Mittal, 47, plans to raise about $450 million by selling some 16 percent control in his family-owned Ispat International group which will be listed on the New York and Amsterdam Stock Exchanges.</p>
<p>Set up in 1989 and based in the Netherlands, Ispat International now owns steel mills in Canada, Ireland, Germany, Mexico and the islands of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The sources told Reuters that about 19.25 million shares are expected to be listed in the $22-$26 range. The issue is being handled by Credit Suisse First Boston and Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. The prospectus for the issue is due to be published next week.</p>
<p>The company had reported net profits of about $615 million on a turnover of $1.8 billion in 1996 on an annual output of nearly six million tonnes of steel.</p>
<p>Mittal, born to a family which started business out of a small scrap metal yard in Calcutta in India, went it alone when he moved to Indonesia in his mid-20s.</p>
<p>Specialising in both flat and long products made in electric mini-arc mills instead of the usual blast furnaces, Ispat's first major breakthrough was the acquisition of what is now Caribbean Ispat in Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p>
<p>Its second big coup was the $220 million purchase of one of Mexico's largest steel mills based in Lazaro Cardenas along the Pacific coast in 1992.</p>
<p>Benefiting from a weak peso combined with strong exports, the operation, now called Ispat Mexicana, had pre-tax earnings of $211 million in 1995 and is now undergoing an expansion drive.</p>
<p>Since then Ispat has taken over Sidbec-Dosco in Canada, the formerly state-owned Irish Steel and Hamberger Stahlwerker in Germany. The group is also buying two mills from Thyssen Stahl in Germany.</p>
<p>Ispat will be using the bulk of the funds on capital expenditure after paying off a loan of $90 million.</p>
<p>Mittal's larger holding group is LNM Group and it recorded a turnover of more than $2.7 billion including operations in Indonesia and Kazakhstan which will not be part of the flotation.</p>
<p>He faces the daunting task of turning around Karmet Steel in Kazakhstan, which is struggling to find its way after the demise of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Karmet, however, was bought due to its proximity to one of the world's largest coking coal deposits, important to reduce costs of making steel.</p>
<p>Mittal and his wife Usha currently hold full control of Ispat. He moved his base to London in 1995 and now lives in a plush mansion in north London.</p>
