<headline>Italy's Bossi proclaims north's &quot;independence&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>VENICE, Italy 1996-09-15</dateline>

<p>Northern League leader Umberto Bossi proclaimed a self-styled &quot;republic&quot; in Italy's affluent north on Sunday in the climax to three days of secessionist rallies.</p>
<p>Addressing several thousand supporters in Venice to solemn music, the separatist firebrand declared a &quot;federal republic of Padania&quot; in a proclamation that copied from the American declaration of independence.  </p>
<p>&quot;We, the peoples of Padania, do solemnly proclaim: Padania is a federal, independent and sovereign republic,&quot; the declaration read.</p>
<p>&quot;And for support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honour,&quot; it continued, echoing the 1776 declaration of American independence.</p>
<p>The ceremony capped a quasi-religious three-day &quot;March to the Sea&quot; by Bossi which failed to attract anywhere near the more than one million followers he had hoped would flock to rallies along his route from the Alpine source of the Po river.</p>
<p>His secessionist quest was instead upstaged by pro-unity rallies across Italy, including one in the northern city of Milan where police estimated at least 150,000 people joined a march organised by the hard-right National Alliance party.</p>
