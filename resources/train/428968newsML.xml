<p>American Stacy Dragila proved the field in the women's pole vault is stronger than many thought with her surprise victory at the world indoor championships on Sunday.</p>
<p>Dragila, a former hurdler, shocked ex-trapeze artist Emma George of Australia who holds both the indoor and outdoor world marks and was expected to walk away with the title.</p>
<p>Instead it was the 25-year-old American who equalled the Australian's indoor mark and claimed the first gold medal ever handed out in the women's pole vault at a major championships.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a few us out there jumping really great height,&quot; said Dragila, who will compete in a full decathlon next month.</p>
<p>&quot;I think in the next couple of years you're going to see it improve even more and take off.</p>
<p>&quot;Emma is a great athlete but I know there's other girls eager for these world championships' titles and capable of jumping great heights.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very difficult for me to take on the pole vault because I don't have the gymnastics background and when I first started doing it I was really scared to go upside down.&quot;</p>
<p>George, who has quickly become to women's pole vaulting what Sergei Bubka is to the men's event, has established eight world records in the last two years.</p>
<p>The acrobatic Australian has brought the event credibility and attention.</p>
<p>&quot;I just love pole vaulting,&quot; said George, who had to settle for the silver with a vault of 4.35. &quot;I like to improve on what I've done before.</p>
<p>&quot;The higher the record gets the more acceptable the event will be.&quot;</p>
<p>The strawberry-blonde athlete is not only her sport's brightest star but its most marketable commodity.</p>
<p>On Sunday it was Dragila, earning $25,000 for her efforts, who stole the limelight.</p>
<p>&quot;I think women will be going 4.80 by 2000. I don't think that is unrealistic at all,&quot; Dragila said.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't imagine having $25,000 in my hand when I have been surviving on $15,000 between me and my husband.&quot;</p>
