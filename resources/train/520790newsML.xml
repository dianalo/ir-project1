<p>Interest costs were the major reason Williams Cos Inc first quarter earnings fell short of analysts' expectations, spokesman Jim Gipson said.</p>
<p>Interest on the debt incurred in the company's expansion of its telecommunications operations was one of the things that limited gains above 1996's record results, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Business fundamentals are really solid,&quot; Gipson said Friday, adding the company expects &quot;another good year.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We're pleased to start the year in a way that will help us achieve our goals for 1997,&quot; was the way chief executive Keith E. Bailey put it when the company reported Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to hit the aggressive targets we have established, all of our businesses must raise their level of performance -- and we must continue to expand in ways that improve the bottom line,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>Williams reported profits of $0.64 per share for the March quarter, up from the $0.63 earned in 1996's initial quarter but short of the First Call consensus estimate of $0.68.</p>
<p>Increased interest reduced earnings by $0.03, Gipson said.  </p>
<p>He also noted the company reported a decline in energy commodity trading operating profits to $16.5 million in the latest quarter from $21.8 million a year earlier and said this was due to lower volatility in the natural gas market.</p>
<p>Petroleum Services, the unit which includes Williams' interstate petroleum products pipeline, first quarter operating profit declined to $14.4 million from $17.8 million.</p>
<p>The decrease primarily was due to a four percent decline in shipments, shorter average hauls and higher operating expenses within the products pipeline business, the company said.  </p>
<p>Gipson said this was due to the economy in the upper Midwest areas served by the pipeline and weather that delayed spring planting.</p>
<p>The company reported a $2 million communications group operating loss compared with an operating profit of $2.8 million in 1996's first quarter, saying the change &quot;was due to the expense of the previously disclosed commitment by management to expand the infrastructure of this business.&quot;</p>
<p>Gipson said Williams has said it expects 1997 to be another building year for its communications unit.  </p>
<p>The company cited the April 10 announcement that Williams and Northern Telecom Ltd will combine customer premise equipment sales and service operations as an example of this effort, adding &quot;this transaction is expected to close within two months and be additive to earnings.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said all three of its interstate natural gas pipelines had increased first quarter operating profits.</p>
