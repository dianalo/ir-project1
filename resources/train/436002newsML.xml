<p>A planned troop reduction pact between China and the ex-Soviet states of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan may be kept secret even after it is signed, the Chinese ambassador to Moscow said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Li Fenglin said the text of the document, which aims to cut forces on both sides of China's border with the former Soviet Union, was practically ready and would be signed during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Moscow late next month.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit is likely to take place in the last 10 days of April and as far as I know the five-way agreement on mutual reduction of armed forces along the common border will be signed then,&quot; Li told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot disclose any details of the document because it is extremely sensitive and it may not even be published after the signing,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Beijing, Russia and the three other former Soviet republics all signed a pact last April committing themselves to a set of confidence building measures along the border. They also decided to work on a more concrete deal to cut forces on the frontier.</p>
<p>A series of talks on the troop-cutting deal have been held behind closed doors and few reliable details have leaked out.</p>
<p>Some sources have said that the five countries will pull back all forces some way from the frontier. But Russian officials have publicly denied such plans.</p>
<p>China and the Soviet Union were military and political allies in 1950s before bitter rivalry for supremacy in the communist world led them apart and finally sparked border clashes in late 1960s.</p>
<p>Relations between the two communist superpowers began to improve rapidly after Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev visited Beijing in 1989 and held talks with paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russian leaders have shown interest in developing ties with China. This interest has grown further since NATO announced plans to expand eastwards in Europe, bringing the western defence pact closer to Russia's borderes.</p>
<p>Some Russian nationalists have suggested that Moscow and Beijing could form a new union to counterbalance NATO.</p>
<p>But ambassador Li ruled out such scenario.</p>
<p>&quot;The principal position of the Chinese government is that it opposes any policy of blocs,&quot; he said. &quot;China understands Russia's worries about NATO's expansion...and hopes that a mutually acceptable solution will be found.&quot;</p>
<p>Li said that Chinese Foreign Minister Qiang Qichen will visit Moscow later this month to prepare the summit meeting.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said earlier this month that Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will also visit China.</p>
