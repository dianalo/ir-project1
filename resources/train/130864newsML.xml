<headline>Opponent of NY green bond wins small victory - paper.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>Robert Schulz, who has sued New York State on a variety of constitutional issues, said he won a small victory in his latest fight over a proposed $1.75 billion green bond issue, the Daily Gazette reported Sunday.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Thomas McAvoy denied Schulz's request for swift action, which could have knocked the environmental bond proposed by Gov. George Pataki off the Nov 5 ballot.</p>
<p>However, the judge found that the suit has a &quot;substantial likelihood of success,&quot; and agreed to hear the case, though not until next year, the paper said.</p>
<p>In the ruling, which was issued on Friday, McAvoy said that if the bond act is approved by the voters, the courts could nullify the vote before any bonds were issued.</p>
<p>Schulz has sued the state, saying that the green bond violates its constitution because it does not specify the measures that will be funded, the paper said. While the act lists various types of projects, it does not name specifics, the Gazette said.</p>
<p>Pataki has said that the environmental bond act is clearly focused, adding the funds that would be raised would not be diverted.</p>
