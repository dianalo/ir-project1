<headline>Australian stocks ends down on Dow plunge.</headline>

<p>The Australian share market ended on Friday with its third consecutive fall in response to the overnight plunge on Wall Street, but investors regained some confidence in the afternoon session.</p>
<p>At the close, the All Ordinaries index was 23.1 points or almost one percent lower at 2,316.5.</p>
<p>December share index futures were down 39 points at 2,305, widening its discount to the underlying index to 11.5 points.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market is still worried about Wall Street as the S&amp;P Globex March contract was about seven points off, which represents one percent off the Dow if it flows through.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a bit of a panic open with the S&amp;P off heavily, that is what really scared our market,&quot; said Greg Matthews, executive director of Australian equities at Mercantile Mutual.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still worried what is going on in the States,&quot; Matthews said. The Dow ended nearly 100 points lower on Thursday. The All Ordinaries briefly dipped under 2300 in early trade, just off the support level of 2295.</p>
<p>Matthews said Australian shares recovered ground in the afternoon as the S&amp;P500 March Globex contract regained some earlier losses and received some confidence from the bond market with U.S. treasuries edging higher in Asian trade.</p>
<p>Losses were right across the board with only the food and retail sectors finding some strength.</p>
<p>The media and banking sectors had the largest falls among the industrials. New Cap Reinsurance Corp made a healthy debut, closing 16 cents above its A$2.53 issue price.</p>
<p>Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about three to one, while about a quarter of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>Derivatives trade picked on Thusday's trade, but was still seen as fairly average trading. Total options traded 45,869 (32,788), while turnover in December SPI contracts totalled 13,638 (7,284).</p>
<p>In other local markets, Australian bonds had a calmer session after aggressive price swings of the past week. Trade was largely concentrated on bond futures roll over to March ahead of Monday's expire of December positions.</p>
<p>By 5.10 p.m. (0610 GMT), 10 year T-bonds were yielding 7.43 percent, up from Thursday's 7.39 percent.</p>
<p>The Australia dollar nudged back into neutral territory at a thin midsession as Japanese buying helped overcome an early wobble. At 5.10 p.m. (0610 GMT), the Australian dollar was quoted at US$.7926/31.</p>
