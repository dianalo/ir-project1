<p>The Israeli army said on Sunday it defused a bomb planted at a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>&quot;An explosive device which was placed north of greenhouses of Kfar Darom settlement in the Gaza Strip was found by Israeli Army soldiers. A sapper who rushed to the spot defused the device. No one was wounded and there was no damage,&quot; the army said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israeli security sources said the explosive device was &quot;large&quot;.</p>
<p>Palestinian Preventive Security Chief in the Gaza Strip Mohammad Dahlan disputed the Israeli report. &quot;There was no bomb,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said in response the Palestinian Authority would have no knowledge of the bomb as it was placed within Kfar Darom settlement limits in an area under Israeli army control.</p>
<p>On April 1, two Palestinian suicide bombers wounded five Arabs in a pair of botched attacks aimed at Jewish targets near the settlements of Kfar Darom and Netzarim.</p>
<p>Israel withdrew from most of Gaza in 1994 under a self-rule peace deal with the PLO but its troops remained to defend several heavily armed settlement enclaves in the Strip.</p>
<p>Palestinian anger has been running high since Israel broke ground on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem on March 18, touching off a new wave of West Bank unrest.</p>
