<p>Hungary's government bond yields are seen rising slightly this week, partly on lack of foreign interest following a rise in inflation in June and floods and trade account uncertainties in the region.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said the yields are likely to rise a little or move sideways in the next one or two months, but would return to a falling pattern later.</p>
<p>The current rising trend is due to some bad domestic and foreign news, which hit the market in the past few weeks, but optimism for rising economic growth, falling inflation and a steady current account is fundamentally unaffected, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;As we see, (the bond yield rise) is temporary,&quot; said Creditanstalt Securities trader Gabor Szogi. &quot;This will go on until inflation begins to go down, probably around October.&quot;</p>
<p>June figures published two weeks ago showed year-on-year inflation rising 18.7 percent, reversing a one-and-a-half year decline and casting doubt on the government's 17 percent target for December, some traders said.</p>
<p>Recent news about rising trade deficits in the Czech Republic and Poland and devastating floods in the two countries have made some foreign investors uncertain about the economic outlook of the whole region.</p>
<p>Szogi said foreign investors were net sellers of Hungary's three-year government bonds, which relative to other bonds are sold in large amounts and will be auctioned on Thursday, setting the pattern for the market for this week.</p>
<p>The yield on three-year bonds were likely to rise 20 to 30 basis points to around 17.8 percent this week, while five-year bond yields stabilised at about 15.75 following a rise after an auction held two weeks ago, traders said.</p>
<p>They added that uncertainties, including the fact that Hungary will hold elections next year, are currently increasing the yield on longer maturities demanded by investors.</p>
<p>&quot;According to our analyst, there is four to five percent real yield on all government paper,&quot; Szogi said. &quot;It is natural that investors want a relatively higher yield on longer maturities if they see increased risks.&quot;</p>
<p>But risks in the Hungarian economy are much lower than in countries to the north as Hungary has been avoided by floods and current account difficulties and inflation was likely to continue to fall after a one-off rise in food prices in the summer, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>They also played down the potential impact of Standard and Poor's decision last week on leaving Hungary's credit rating unchanged at BBB-minus with stable outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;This was somewhat unfavourable,&quot; said Postabank Securities analyst Attila Torok. &quot;But there have been other credit rating agencies which upgraded Hungary recently and I hope there will be more later this year.&quot;</p>
