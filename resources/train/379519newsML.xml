<p>An independent panel of health experts Thursday called for changes in the Clinton administration's AIDS policy, including the introduction of controversial needle exchange programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;AIDS is a preventable disease and the behaviour placing the public health at greatest risk may be occurring in legislative and decision-making bodies,&quot; said panel chairman David Reiss, professor and director of psychiatric research at George Washington University Medical Centre.</p>
<p>Reiss noted that policy changes made through government leadership in such severely AIDS-stricken countries as Uganda and Thailand had set model examples of how new cases of HIV infection could be effectively reduced and urged U.S. policymakers to do likewise.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not too late for the political leadership of the United States to follow their example,&quot; Reiss said.</p>
<p>The 12-member panel convened by the National Institutes of Health reviewed hundreds of scientific studies, listened to presentations by 15 research experts and public testimony during three days of hearings.</p>
<p>It determined that intervention programmes such as a needle exchange, which provides sterile needles to drug users so they do not have to share or re-use them, drug abuse treatment, and youth education on safer sex were successful scientifically.</p>
<p>While conceding that these programmes were &quot;controversial politically,&quot; the panel urged decision makers to put politics aside and base policy on science.</p>
<p>The panel reviewed needle exchange programmes and concluded that such intervention did not increase the number of drug users.</p>
<p>&quot;The panel strongly recommends the lifting of government restrictions on needle exchange programmes and the legalisation of pharmacy sales of sterile injecting equipment,&quot; Reiss said.</p>
<p>The health experts also concluded that methadone treatment programmes, outpatient drug-free treatments, residential treatment or detoxification not only decreased drug use but also substantially reduced the frequency of sharing needles.</p>
<p>The panel criticised the downward trend of federal funding of drug treatment programmes and urged it be reversed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the nation's leading AIDS advocacy group called on President Clinton to name a high profile nominee to serve as the White House's head of national AIDS policy to replace outgoing director Patsy Fleming.</p>
<p>Among those suggested by AIDS Action were former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, former Texas Gov. Ann Richards and Gen. John Shalikashvili, who is retiring as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
