<p>A tanker exploded and caught fire in the bay off Lagos on Friday, sending hundreds of workers in the Nigerian city centre rushing from their offices in panic.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe there have been casualties but no one knows for certain yet,&quot; said a shipping source in Lagos.</p>
<p>Navy Captain Shuaibu Amodu, head of security at the Lagos port, said the explosion was caused by welding work.</p>
<p>He told the News Agency of Nigeria that a gas cylinder being used for repair work on the tanker exploded, tearing off the bow and setting the ship on fire.</p>
<p>Thick black smoke billowed from the ship. &quot;There is a huge hole in the side of the vessel but it is still floating,&quot; a Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>Nigerian shipping authorities said the fire was put out and port operations were normal.</p>
<p>London-based managers of the tanker Al Zainab said it had finished discharging a cargo of naphtha and was entering port to load provisions when the explosion occurred just before noon.</p>
<p>The 29,800-deadweight-ton vessel was built in 1971 and flies the flag of St Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>
<p>Lagos handles general cargo and oil products but not crude oil, which is exported from terminals in eastern ports.</p>
<p>Workers in the city centre feared the blast was another in a series of bombs that have rocked Nigeria's commercial hub in recent months.</p>
<p>Politically volatile Nigeria has been hit by bomb blasts since December. The most recent was at a mosque in the eastern city of Onitsha, killing five worshippers.</p>
