<p>Canadian bonds closed stronger on Thursday, buoyed by tame U.S. economic data, with the market remaining focused on tomorrow's key report on U.S. nonfarm payrolls, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're certainly being helped out by a reasonably positive tone in the U.S.,&quot; said Randall Powley, a senior economist with Scotia Capital Markets. &quot;Canada isn't doing better than the U.S. at this point, but we really should be.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.58 to C$111.38 to yield 7.046 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark rose 24/32 to yield 6.65 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the benchmark bonds widened to 40 basis points from 38 basis points at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Canadian and U.S. fixed-income markets rallied this morning following the release of U.S. economic data, including initial jobless claims, which suggested that the economy there is continuing to slow with no sign of inflation.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada also reported that Canada's real gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in August, but the report had little impact on bonds, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market is now focused on the key U.S. non-farm payrolls data out tomorrow.  </p>
<p>&quot;That's going to set the tone for the next month,&quot; said Powley.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's payroll data is seen as a key indication of whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates before the end of the year.</p>
<p>In new issue news, the Government of Canada said it plans to auction on November 6 C$2.4 billion of bonds with a coupon of 7.25 percent and maturing on June 1, 2007.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada said it will buy C$240 million of the new bonds. The bonds, which will be dated and delivered on November 15, pay interest on December 1 and June 1.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada 7.0 percent of 2006 rose C$0.50 to C$104.35 to yield 6.406 percent. The U.S. 10-year benchmark rose 16/32 to yield 6.34 percent.</p>
<p>The spread between the bonds widened to seven basis points from six at the close of trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash bill traded at 3.10 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.15 percent.</p>
