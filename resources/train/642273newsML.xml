<headline>U.S. debt futures rally to end sharply higher.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. debt futures futures shook off a quick morning pullback and rallied to big daily gains as the long end vaulted to its highest level since last winter.</p>
<p>A confluence of fundamental factors hoisted lead-month futures upward as traders decided the morning's U.S. jobs figures were inconclusive as far as their effect on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (the rise) was the market reacting to several fundamental events throughout the day, none of them the payrolls report,&quot; said one Treasury bond futures floor broker, who ticked off a lengthy list of reasons for the advance.  </p>
<p>Rumors circulated widely on the trading floors Friday that an Asian central bank had bought large amounts of two- to 10-year U.S. Treasury notes in the cash market, brokers said.</p>
<p>Rumors also spread in debt and foreign exchange markets about the possibility of a delay in European monetary union, which sparked remarks from an EU commissioner that the drive to EMU was irreversible. German finance minister Theo Waigel said there was no talk in government about an EMU delay.</p>
<p>More rumors abounded that U.S. Treasury would reduce its 10-year T-note auctions. A Treasury source said no decision had been made on whether to cut some 10-year T-note sales.  </p>
<p>Reported comments by several U.S. government officials also encouraged buying, floor brokers said.</p>
<p>Treasury secretary Robert Rubin said the probability was good for continuing low inflation. White House economist Janet Yellen said Friday's jobs data was evidence that the economy was on solid footing for continued job creation and growth.</p>
<p>Floor brokers also said they saw signs of unwinding of curve steepening trades and setting of curve-flattening ones.</p>
<p>Technicals also played a pivotal role as Treasury bond and Eurodollar futures proved extremely resilient in the face of a U.S. jobs report that traders said was inconclusive.  </p>
<p>After three consecutive days of falling open interest - the number of open contracts in T-bond futures slumped about 66,000 since Monday - brokers said players appeared to pile back in, and the contract darted through resistance zones.</p>
<p>September Treasury bond futures decisively cracked resistance spanning 110-04/32 to 110-09/32 that had repeatedly repelled advances this week. It surged to a peak of 111-09/32, its highest price since the 111-24/32 high set February 26.</p>
<p>The market dipped when April U.S. payrolls were revised to a gain of 323,000 nonfarm jobs from a rise of 142,000 jobs and May's jobless rate fell to its lowest level since October 1973.  </p>
<p>&quot;You can't make an overwhelmingly compelling argument for (credit) tightening,&quot; said John Nyhoff, chief economist, Tokyo-Mitsubishi Futures (USA) Inc, of the jobs figures.</p>
<p>Technically, he also cited the lacked of technical downside followthrough as persuading buyers to step back in.</p>
<p>T-bond brokers added that much of the day's buying appeared to emanate from hedgers rather than speculators, which could help keep prices supported.</p>
<p>Sept T-bonds rallied 1-07/32 to 111-07/32, 10-yr notes rose 22/32 to 108-00, munis rallied 1-01/32 to 117-09/32, Sept bills gained 0.045 to 94.695, Dec Euros rose 0.070 to 93.860. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750)) E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
