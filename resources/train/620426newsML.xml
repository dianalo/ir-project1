<p>Florida's Tampa Sports Authority plans to sell $204.5 million of revenue bonds for the new Buccaneers' stadium in mid-June, an authority official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The deal is set to close by July 1, with pricing set about two weeks before that, said authority Executive Director Henry Saavedra.</p>
<p>Smith Barney Inc is senior manager for the negotiated deal.</p>
<p>The Florida Supreme Court cleared the way for the bond issue last week by ruling that local officials acted within their authority when they agreed to build the stadium to keep the professional football team from moving away.</p>
<p>Christine Beck, senior assistant Hillsborough County attorney, said she was suprised that the court ruled just three weeks after hearing oral arguments in the case.</p>
<p>&quot;We were hopeful that the court would recignize the great public importance of the issue and they did,&quot; Beck said. It was still unprecendented to go to oral arguments as soon as we did and get a ruling as soon as we did. We're elated.&quot;</p>
<p>Construction on the 65,000-seat stadium began last fall, shortly after voters approved a sales tax increase for the stadium and other projects.</p>
<p>But the bond issue was delayed when former Tampa Mayor Bill Poe filed suit arguing that the stadium plan was unconstitutional because it would use public funds to benefit the private, for-profit football team.</p>
<p>Without the bond proceeds, the city and county would have had only enough money to continue construction through July 1, Beck said.</p>
