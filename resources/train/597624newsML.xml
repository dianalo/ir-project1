<p>Colombia's industrial sector showed few signs of emerging from recession in the first quarter, according to a report released Tuesday by the country's leading organization of private industry.</p>
<p>Production of manufactured goods fell by 3.3 percent in the first quarter, with sales dropping an average 1.4 percent, the National Industrialists Association reported.</p>
<p>&quot;These numbers are disastrous when you consider that they are compared with a very bad trimester last year,&quot; the association's president, Luis Carlos Villegas, said at a news conference.  </p>
<p>Villegas said metal output, which had shown signs of recuperation, dropped by 2.8 percent.</p>
<p>Textile production fell by 10.6 percent, with sales falling 5.9 percent. Cement and non-metallic mineral production fell 15.5 percent, with sales down 13.2 percent.</p>
<p>Production of paper and glass-related products showed significant improvement, though those sectors are not likely provide the economic boost Colombia needs, Villegas said.</p>
<p>Some of the drop in production may reflect adjustments by manufacturers that perceive a further slackening of demand, he said.  </p>
<p>Falling demand, a thriving black market and political instability are the chief concerns of Colombian industrialists according to the report, which was based on results of a recent survey by the association.</p>
