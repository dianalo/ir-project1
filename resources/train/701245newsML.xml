<headline>Med products mixed, gas oil down with futures,.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-02</dateline>

<p>Med oil products were mixed on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Gas oil fell slightly across the board in line with slightly softer underlying futures. The July IPE contract ended 25 cents adrift at $167.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders see a slightly bullish supply background amid talk of run cuts and restricted production. Italian output is focused mainly on buoyant domestic demand.</p>
<p>Russian heating oil was assessed slightly firmer at around cif high quotes +$2.50/$3 basis Genoa.</p>
<p>The main focus of regional demand continues to be Greece, taking advantage of the contango market to buy for winter storage.</p>
<p>The award of a Turkish tender for two cargoes of 25,000 tonnes each of 0.7 percent sulphur gas oil, with an option for a third, for mid-July delivery is due out on Friday evening.</p>
<p>Gasoline was steady after seeing a strong hike in levels on Tuesday. Prices for premium unleaded were pegged at $194 for cif and about $8 lower for fob cargoes.</p>
<p>Naphtha saw Algerian and Egyptian cargoes sought after in NWE, but no fresh movement was heard today. Cargoes were pricing around $165 fob on talk.</p>
<p>High sulphur was steady with no fresh reports of any sales by an Italian refiner with some 40,000 tonnes of material.</p>
<p>There was unconfirmed talk that one percent traded at high levels for Tunisian material.</p>
<p>Market analysts said they expected demand would continue steady to strong for low sulphur this summer, adding that official Italian statistics issued recently showed electricity production from fossil fuel rose in May on a year-on-year basis.</p>
<p>&quot;These statistics confirm strong fuel oil demand... For June, we see some strong demand and in any case it is a reversal of the trend in the previous months,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;In July, the weather is quiet warm, so that could play an important role in electricity generation for air-conditioning and a recession in the industrial production seemed to have ended.</p>
<p>&quot;So we can be quiet optimistic about electricity demand compared to the first three or four months this year, at least there will not be a drop like we saw in February or March,&quot; the analyst added. --London newsroom, +44 171 542 8145</p>
