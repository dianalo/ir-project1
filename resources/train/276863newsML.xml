<p>If the industrial chaos unleashed by unions furious at the passage of a new labour law continues, it could postpone South Korea's economic recovery, inhibiting exports and casting a pall over the weakened stock market, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the downturn was a bitter pill that had to be swallowed to help the nation's boardrooms restructure for a more profitable future, they added.</p>
<p>The ruling New Korea Party rammed controversial legislation allowing lay-offs and flexible work hours through parliament on Thursday.</p>
<p>Strikes were almost immediately called by the outlawed Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, halting production at leading auto makers and shipyards.</p>
<p>The main union organisation, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, has called for a strike starting on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;If these strikes continue for a long time, this will have a major detrimental effect on the economy in the first quarter of next year,&quot; said Tae Chung, head of research at Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul.</p>
<p>&quot;The strikes will lead to production losses, export losses and a deterioration of the current account deficit,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The stock market fell over 22 points to touch a new year low of 655.24 on Thursday before closing at 659.01. It has declined by 26 percent from the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>A record 920 stocks lost ground on Thursday, compared to only 64 gainers.</p>
<p>In the worst case scenario, according to the Daewoo Economic Research Institute, labour disputes could devolve into prolonged and violent struggles between labour and management, as seen during 1989.</p>
<p>Over a five-month period in 1989, 409,000 workers took part in strikes that robbed the nation of 63.51 million work days, the institute said. Lost production was valued at 42 billion won ($49 million), and lost exports at $1.36 billion.</p>
<p>If that situation were repeated, South Korea could see its gross domestic product (GDP) growth decline to 5.6 percent, compared to estimates of growth of 5.9 percent under normal circumstances, the institute showed.</p>
<p>The government's leading think tank, Korea Development Institute (KDI), has estimated that GDP would grow by 6.4 percent in 1997, against seven percent this year. This does not take into account massive labour unrest.</p>
<p>Daewoo said the current account deficit could widen to $21.71 billion in 1997, compared to a best-case estimate of $18.12 billion.</p>
<p>The KDI has predicted a deficit of $15.5 billion next year, compared to an estimated $21.9 billion this year.</p>
<p>Many analysts said labour unions would be hard pressed to get public support now with South Korea's economy slowing down.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be big strikes throughout the country, but the government will get the support of the people,&quot; said Namuh Rhee, head of research at Dongbang Peregrine Securities. &quot;When Koreans feel they are in a crisis, they rally around the government.&quot;</p>
<p>Chung said despite the spectre of industrial mayhem, he now planned to recommend Korean stocks to long-term foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;The new labour act will have a very positive impact on the economy,&quot; he said. &quot;Short-term, this will come at the expense of strikes, labour unrest and further deterioration of the economy. But this should be off-set by the long-term recovery.&quot; ($1 = 844 won)</p>
