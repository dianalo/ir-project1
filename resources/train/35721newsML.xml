<p>Strong business fundamentals and a presumed change in the shareholder profile of Wallace Computer Services Inc should protect it from a bid by investor Guy Wyser-Pratte to remove the company's poison pill takeover defense, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they've done a terrific job of creating shareholder value and I think it will come out at some time,&quot; said Judith Scott, analyst at Robert W. Baird.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, many arbitrageurs likely sold their Wallace stock after Moore Corp Ltd said in early August it was abandoning its 13-month takeover campaign, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since August 6, you've had a substantial change in the profile of the Wallace shareholder base,&quot; said Martin McDevitt Jr., analyst at Cleary Gull Reiland and McDevitt.  &quot;Most of the selling since the early part of August is on behalf of arbitrageurs.&quot;</p>
<p>McDevitt conceded that he could not say for sure how much of the selling in the stock has been from arbitrageurs.  </p>
<p>But he argued that the shareholder base is probably more composed of shareholders looking for a longer-term return. His 12-15 month price target for Wallace is $36-$40 a share, with other analysts in the $35-$36 range.</p>
<p>The stock was unchanged at 27-1/4 Thursday.</p>
<p>After Moore withdrew its bid, Wyser-Pratte, who controls a 2.3 percent stake in Wallace, filed proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to have three directors elected to Wallace's board.  He is also seeking the repeal a bylaw requiring an 80 percent vote to approve certain mergers.  </p>
<p>In an interview, Wyser-Pratte argued that while Wallace shareholders could have received $60 a share from Moore a year ago, the stock, on a pro forma basis adjusting for a stock split, is trading just above $54.</p>
<p>But analysts counter that the company posted higher than expected earnings of $1.60 a share in the fiscal year ended July 31 and that the stock price should improve after uncertainty over the Wyser-Pratte proposals subsides.</p>
<p>&quot;We think over the next three to five years, the company can grow 15 percent a year on the bottom line,&quot; McDevitt said.  </p>
<p>But while forecasting better results and a higher stock price for the company, not all analysts are convinced Wyser-Pratte will be unsuccessful in having the poison pill defense removed.</p>
<p>Kenneth Bohringer, analyst at Prudential Securities Research, noted that 59.8 percent of Wallace's shares were tendered to Moore's bid last year.</p>
<p>&quot;I would assume that going forward, they can expect challenges to the poison pill,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think that they have been vindicated by the performance they put together over the last year.&quot;</p>
