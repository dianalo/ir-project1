<p>The key June 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract will probably be stuck in range trade on Tuesday,traders said.</p>
<p>The upside of JGBs may be heavy, however, due to expected launches of about 145 billion yen worth of corporate straight bonds on Tuesday and Wednesday, they said.</p>
<p>NKK Corp, Ibiden Co Ltd, Hokushin Co Ltd and Tomen Corp are expected to launch a total of 45 billion yen in straight bonds on Tuesday, and unless the market falls sharply, Toshiba Corp is expected to launch 100 billion yen in straights on Wednesday, a trader at a city bank's securities unit said.  </p>
<p>The coupon rate for the four-year government notes to be offered through a Finance Ministry auction on Tuesday, is likely to set at 1.7 or 1.8 percent, traders said.</p>
<p>MOF's offer is due at 10.30 a.m. (0130 GMT).</p>
<p>The four-year note offer is likely to be met with healthy investor demand, as the coupon rate is likely to be raised substantially from the previous four-year issue's 1.1 percent, the city bank trader said.</p>
<p>Another factor which may dampen JGB sentiment is the large open interest in June JGB futures put options with a strike price of 123.00, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the June falls to near 123.00, the speed of the fall may gain momentum due to moves related to the put options,&quot; a trader at a trust bank's securities unit said.</p>
<p>Open interest in the 123.00 June JGB futures put options was 12,564 contracts as of Monday's close.</p>
<p>The June JGB futures options will expire at the end of this week.</p>
<p>Hedge funds are probably behind the large open interest in the put options and may be holding about 6,000 contracts worth of the 123.00 June, the trader said.</p>
