<headline>Budapest BUX ends lower, sentiment remains bearish.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-03-07</dateline>

<p>Hungarian share prices drifted lower as the market's sentiment remained bearish amid fears of an interest rate raise in the U.S., traders said.</p>
<p>The BUX index finished at 5,381.15 points, down 78.23.</p>
<p>BUX futures ended lower for all maturities, by between 44.50 and 202.50 points. March BUX finished ended at 5,387.5 points, down 44.50.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason behind the fall should be sought in international events,&quot; said Peter Lencs of MKB Securities. &quot;It seems that...expectations of interest rate hike are stronger now than before.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said that not even a major deal between the exchange's two leading firms, MOL and TVK, could give a positive tone to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing we can say about these two stocks is that at least they didn't fall,&quot; one trader said earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Under the deal MOL will deliver about one million tonnes of chemical benzine and gas oil to TVK per year, and rebuys the motor fuel components and benzol product made of these materials, for further processing.</p>
<p>MOL closed at 3,100 forints, down 10, while TVK closed steady at 2,250 forints.</p>
<p>On Friday many of the bourse's leading shares, including plastics maker Pannonplast, home improvement product maker Graboplast and hotel firm Danubius lost substantially.</p>
<p>Pannonplast closed at 7,560 forints, down 340; Graboplast ended at 7,800, down 300, while Danubius fell 160 forints tol finish at 5,140.</p>
<p>Meanwhile certain less liquid papers posted strong gains.</p>
<p>Textile industrial Pannon-Flax and garment factory Styl rose 65 forints and 100 forints to 800 and 1,600 forints, respectively. Pannon-Flax's closing price was a new 52-week high.</p>
<p>Agricultural trading company Agrimpex gained a massive 3,000 forints to close at 21,000.</p>
