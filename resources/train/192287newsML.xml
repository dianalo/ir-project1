<headline>Argentine recession not over yet - industry lobby.</headline>

<p>The head of the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA) business lobby, Jorge Blanco Villegas, said in comments published Friday that the recession that started in the second quarter of 1995 is still not completely over.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot exactly say the recession has finished,&quot; he told Clarin newspaper at a business dinner Thursday. &quot;What there has been is a relative improvement in the economy.&quot;  </p>
<p>Official data shows Argentina began to emerge from the Tequila recession in the second quarter of this year, when it had GDP growth of 3.2 percent, followed by 6.6 percent growth in the third quarter announced this week.</p>
<p>Economists are predicting fourth quarter growth of 6.0-7.0 percent, which would take annual growth this year to three percent after last year's 4.6 percent contraction.</p>
<p>Argentine President Carlos Menem said in a speech to the UIA Thursday night that he did believe &quot;the recession has been overcome in recent months&quot; according not just to statistics, but also to international bodies such as the World Bank.</p>
<p>However, the Argentine Chamber of Commerce said in a report that supermarket sales showed the economic recovery is still not consumer-led, and that shop sales would not begin to reflect recovery until next year.</p>
<p>Official data released Thursday showed supermarket sales fell to $734 million in September from $804 million in August, reaching their lowest point since May this year.</p>
