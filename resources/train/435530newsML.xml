<title>PORTUGAL: GOLF-OLAZABAL TAKES SECOND RECOVERY STEP.</title>
<headline>GOLF-OLAZABAL TAKES SECOND RECOVERY STEP.</headline>
<dateline>LISBON, Portugal 1997-03-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Jose Maria Olazabal continues on the road to recovery on Thursday when he plays in the Portuguese Open at Aroeira.</p>
<p>After the Spaniard has taken on the undulating wooded course on the Costa Azul, just south of Lisbon, he will compete in next week's Turespana Masters in Gran Canaria.</p>
<p>If the two-week stint passes without setback, as did his first event of the year in Dubai, he will confirm his participation in the Freeport-McDermott Classic in New Orleans on April 3-6 and the Masters at Augusta the following weekend.</p>
<p>Missing from his schedule is the Players' Championship in Jacksonville between March 27 and 30, usually regarded as essential preparation for Augusta combatants but deemed by Olazabal to be a tournament too many at this stage of his comeback.</p>
<p>&quot;I had four days' rest and spent the week very quietly after playing Dubai,&quot; said the 1994 Masters champion whose career was threatened by arthritis. &quot;I have to be careful at this point and I don't want to take any risks. I am playing two at a time for now and after the Masters I will see how I feel.&quot;</p>
<p>The Spaniard, who finished an encouraging 12th in the Desert Classic, insisted: &quot;I have not taken any medication for two months and although my feet are still a bother it is discomfort rather than pain that I am feeling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After a round I go to the physiotherapy centre for treatment to my lower back and when I get back to my hotel I have a hot bath. Then I do some toe exercises. No problems so far but there is still a long way to go.&quot;</p>
<p>Seve Ballesteros on Tuesday refused to confirm that he too had been consulting Dr Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wolfhart, the German specialist who has been treating Olazabal for the last six months.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a private matter that I don't want to talk about,&quot; said the Ryder Cup captain, who insisted he had been practising at his home in Santander rather than visiting Munich for treatment for his long-standing back problems.</p>
<p>The German, known as &quot;Dr Feelgood,&quot; has treated sports stars such as Linford Christie, Boris Becker, and Gerhard Berger.</p>
<p>Ballesteros had eight birdies in a pro-am 68 on Wednesday prior to his first appearance in the Portuguese Open for 11 years. After scoring 84 in his last round in Dubai to miss the halfway cut for the third successive event, that represents a glimmer of light at the end of a dark tunnel.</p>
<p>&quot;It has not been a very good start to the year,&quot; Ballesteros said. &quot;But if I keep working on my game, sooner or later things will change.&quot; He has only next week's tournament in the Canaries followed by New Orleans to get in trim for Augusta.</p>
<p>Four other members of Europe's 1995 Ryder Cup team -- Mark James, Howard Clark, Sam Torrance and David Gilford, are also competing for a title defended by Australian Wayne Riley.</p>
