<p>South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Friday accused the Public Enterprises Ministry of indifference towards the privatisation of state diamond mining company Alexkor.</p>
<p>&quot;The privatisation ought to have happened last year already,&quot; NUM General Secretary Kgalema Motlanthe told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It's ironic when the government complains it can't privatise (because of unions), but in the only case where they have a willing partner in labour and the community, there's dilly-dallying by the ministry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Motlanthe said the Public Enterprises Ministry was acting on advice from an official who often did not attend meetings of the Restructuring and Transformation Committee (RTC).</p>
<p>The RTC, charged with planning the restructuring and eventual privatisation of the company, said in a separate statement on Thursday that deadlock had been reached on corporate governance after a disagreement with the government.</p>
<p>It gave no further details, but said the issue had been referred to the Inter-ministerial Coordinating Committee. In the meantime, the RTC has suspended its operations.</p>
<p>The sale of up to 100 percent of the Namaqualand diamond mine is under consideration as part of the government's ongoing privatisation programme.</p>
<p>Motlanthe said the Alexkor privatisation was so far behind schedule that there was a suspicion that it was being deliberately run down so that it could be sold &quot;for a song&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view is that it's a resource. (But) there's real widespread theft on that mine. Diamonds are disappearing like there's no tomorrow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a bid to jumpstart the privatisation, Motlanthe said the NUM would ask for assistance from a cluster of government ministries including finance, trade and industry, minerals and energy affairs and transport.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to be knocking on all those doors,&quot; he said.</p>
