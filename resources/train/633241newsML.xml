<p>President Laurent Kabila's troops on Tuesday surrounded the house of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa, family members said.</p>
<p>Two trucks full of soldiers, armed with automatic weapons, emptied into the streets around the house in the Limete suburb and stayed for about three hours before leaving, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;When I went out I asked their commander what they were doing, but he refused to answer,&quot; Marthe Tshisekedi, the opposition leader's wife, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Opposition militants outside the house said the soldiers left at around 6.p.m. (1700 GMT) but had vowed to return during the night.</p>
<p>They said they feared there were plans to arrest Tshisekedi, who has spoken out against Kabila for giving himself sweeping powers since ousting former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last month.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi, who claims to be prime minister on the basis of a 1992 national conference, has also called for the withdrawal of Rwandan and other foreign troops from Kabila's army.</p>
<p>Kabila's ruling alliance has banned political activity in Kinshasa and troops have broken up protest marches organized by Tshisekedi's supporters. Opposition militants say they will continue to defy the ban and will march on Friday.</p>
