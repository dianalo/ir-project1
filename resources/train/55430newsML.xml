<p>Hijackers seized a bus in the southern Russian region of Dagestan on Monday, then freed all 36 people aboard but took hostage a member of the local parliament, RIA news agency said.</p>
<p>Quoting transport police in the Dagestan capital Makhachkala, where the hijacking took place, RIA said they were making for the airport. Parliament member Gadzhi Makhachev had chanced upon the incident and offered to negotiate, it added.  </p>
<p>An Interior Ministry spokesman in Moscow said earlier that two or three &quot;bandits&quot; had hijacked the bus with around 35 people aboard and were demanding $100,000 ransom. He could not confirm an earlier RIA report that the hijackers were from the troubled neighbouring region of Chechnya.</p>
<p>The ministry spokesman said the hijackers had demanded a helicopter. He could not say where they wanted to go.</p>
<p>Last January Chechen separatist guerrillas led by Salman Raduyev took hundreds of hostages in the Dagestan town of Kizlyar and then withstood days of Russian bombardment in the village of Pervomaiskoye before escaping back across the Chechen border.</p>
<p>Monday's incident was more reminiscent of hijackings by Chechens before war broke out in Chechnya in December 1994. Small groups held up buses for ransom in neighbouring regions on several occasions.</p>
