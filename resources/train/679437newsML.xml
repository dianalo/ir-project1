<p>A diminished British Lions squad of 21 will fly in and out of Bloemfontein on the day for Tuesday's game against Free State.</p>
<p>The remainder of the party will fly directly to Durban to begin preparations for what could be the decisive second test after the Lions' 25-16 victory over the Springboks at Newlands on Saturday.</p>
<p>The day trip has become an increasingly popular trend in South Africa with the All Blacks having set the pattern on their victorious tour last year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's one of the facts of modern professional rugby life,&quot; said manager Fran Cotton.</p>
<p>&quot;With the tests on three successive Saturdays you can't afford to spend time in these places.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lions will name their team for the match against Free State on Monday but it is bound to include a handful of players who were involved in the test victory.</p>
<p>Tony Underwood, Simon Shaw and Eric Miller -- none of whom were involved on Saturday -- have all had influenza while test prop Tom Smith and flyhalf Gregor Townsend are recovering from slight injuries. That means the selectors may have only 30 names to choose from.</p>
<p>But with eight victories from their nine matches on tour, confidence is running high for the Lions' final match against Super 12 opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;Free State are arguably the best team in South Africa at the moment,&quot; said Cotton.</p>
<p>&quot;They are a very tough provincial team and it will be a hell of a game. We are hoping that most of the test side won't be playing.</p>
<p>&quot;When all is said and done you are remembered for your test results.&quot;</p>
