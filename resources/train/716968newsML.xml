<p>Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger separatists who seized the crew of a North Korean ship this week could release their captives soon, aid officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The naval wing of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) seized the vessel Morang Bong and its 38 crew late on Monday when the ship was some eight km (five miles) off Point Pedro on the former rebel stronghold of Jaffna peninsula.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the rebels) have contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and might release the crew, and the dead body of one crew member who was killed, very soon,&quot; an aid official said in the government-held town of Vavuniya, some 220 km (135 miles) north of the capital Colombo.</p>
<p>The clandestine Voice of Tiger radio, monitored in Vavuniya, said on Wednesday that one of the ship's crew was killed in a shootout with the rebels when the crew tried to escape.</p>
<p>&quot;At one point the crew tried to escape and to prevent them from getting away the Sea Tigers opened fire and brought the ship under their control. In this incident one crew member was killed. The dead body is being kept with due respect and the rest of the crew are safe,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;The LTTE are making all attempts to hand over the dead body and the remaining crew to appropriate people,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>An ICRC spokesman told Reuters in Colombo on Wednesday that they hoped to receive the body of the dead sailor soon.</p>
<p>He said he was awaiting further details.</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry statement said on Tuesday the North Korean ship was now anchored off Chalai on the northeastern coast of Sri Lanka, which is under rebel control.</p>
<p>&quot;This ship had been chartered by traders from Colombo to carry essential goods to Point Pedro for the civilians in the north,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>An official of Monsell International, the ship's agent in Colombo, said the ship had carried nearly 3,000 tonnes of food and essential items to Point Pedro and was hijacked after it had unloaded its cargo.</p>
<p>Food and other essential supplies are taken to Jaffna by air or sea as there is no land route connecting the peninsula with the rest of the island.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 Sri Lankan troops are battling LTTE fighters to open a highway through the northern rebel-held Wanni region toward Jaffna. But a government offensive launched in May has slowed down following fierce counter-attacks by the rebels.</p>
<p>Tamil rebels set fire to a refugee ship off the northwestern coast last week and took away its nine crew, including two Indonesians. The Indonesians were later freed, but there is no information about the fate of the remaining seven Sri Lankan crew.</p>
<p>The LTTE has been fighting since 1983 for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east. The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war while the LTTE puts the toll higher.</p>
