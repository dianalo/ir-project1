<p>Britain's dairy and distribution company Unigate Plc announced a rise in underlying profits on Monday despite lower commodity prices for butter and milk powder, and presented a promising view of its future prospects.</p>
<p>But finance director John Worby attacked the UK's main milk supplier, Milk Marque, for creating an inflexible system for the sale of milk.</p>
<p>The company reported full-year pretax pre-exceptional profit of 129.6 million pounds, up 3.4 percent, above the top end of analysts' forecasts of 128 millions pounds.</p>
<p>The group's shares hit a new all-time-high at 505 pence at the opening, but retreated afterwards to trade unchanged at 496 1/2 pence late morning.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Worby said Unigate was now seeing a much more stable market for its dairy produce after lower commodity prices for butter and milk powder reduced the group's profits by about 12 million pounds ($19.6 million) in the year to March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>World commodity prices for butter and powder milk, by-products of Unigate's production, much of which is skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, fell some 13 percent in the year due mainly to the strength of sterling.</p>
<p>In the previous year commodity prices were helped by buying pressure from Russia. &quot;The market environment is now much more stable. In the butter and milk powder area margins are now stable if at lower levels than last year. The commodity trading side should not see any further deterioration,&quot; said Worby.</p>
<p>&quot;We are particularly seeing an improvement in our fresh foods business,&quot; said Worby. &quot;The bacon and ham product side have started the year well and we continue to see growth in sales, benefiting from the launch of new products in Britain and France,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The group's fresh food profits rose 67.3 percent in the year to 66.4 million stg. Unigate has relaunched its Shape range of yoghurt products and variants, Tournolive margarine spread and Les Delices St Hubert deserts in France.</p>
<p>The company also benefited from a decline in the cost of milk bought from Milk Marque, which sells 60 percent of Britain's milk, to 22.1 pence per litre from about 25 pence.</p>
<p>At the same time the price of milk sold by Unigate to supermarkets fell, said Worby, although this was partly offset by stable prices for milk delivered directly to private homes.</p>
<p>But Worby was critical of Milk Marque, the farmer-owned group which supplies more than half the milk in England and Wales.</p>
<p>He said the practice of setting a floor for milk prices was wrong, and called for the market to determine prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole system for selling milk is inflexible. The system has imposed on it an artificial floor price. We do not think you need a floor. The market should be allowed to find an appropriate floor. Also we think they have calculated it</p>
