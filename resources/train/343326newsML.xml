<p>IPE gas oil futures ended sharply higher on Thursday, boosted by strong NYMEX heating oil, brokers said.</p>
<p>February gas oil futures last traded $7.75 a tonne higher at the intra-day high of $212.25 a tonne boosted by strong heating oil on NYMEX.</p>
<p>Bullish U.S. distillate inventory data on Wednesday and forecasts for colder weather in the U.S. Northeast were the main driving factors, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's just a continuation of yesterday helped by the cold weather in the States,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Independent forecaster Weather Services Corp saw below average temperatures in the key heating market of the U.S. Northeast over the next few days, increasing heating needs.</p>
<p>Temperatures in Northwest Europe were also forecast to be slightly below normal for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>In a consolidation of Wednesday's gains March Brent traded 11 cents higher at $22.88 a barrel at 1745 GMT. The contract tested $23 in early afternoon trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was a more bullish tone to the market, but said it would need more news before it could push through resistance at $23.00.</p>
