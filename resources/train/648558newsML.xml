<p>A widening racketeer payoff scandal could ensnare top executives at Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB), and analysts say the bank needs to take drastic steps to repair damage to its reputation from the affair.</p>
<p>Public outrage over the scandal has forced DKB, Japan's second-largest bank in terms of deposits, to cancel initial plans for a management reshuffle and bank sources said on Sunday that a new line-up would be unveiled in a few days.</p>
<p>The original plan would have promoted vice president Ichiro Fujita to the post of president, but it was scuttled, a bank source said, in part due to fears of further arrests linked to the bank's loans to a &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeer.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, prosecutors arrested four DKB officials on suspicion of extending uncollateralised loans to Ryuichi Koike, the racketeer at the heart of a scandal which has also ensnared giant Nomura Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Dai-Ichi Kangyo said on May 23 that its president Katsuhiko Kondo and chairman Tadashi Okuda would resign their posts and become advisers, and be replaced by Fujita and another vice-president, Yoshiharu Mani. The bank had defended its choice of Fujita, who has admitted he knew of the loans.</p>
<p>The bank's top management appeared to have misjudged both the level of public anger and authorities' reaction to the scandal, which emerged just as Japan gears up for &quot;Big Bang&quot; financial reforms aimed at introducing greater competition into the nation's banking, broking and insurance industries.</p>
<p>&quot;What is really surprising is the way that DKB management is handling this,&quot; said James McGinness, a banking analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson International. &quot;I think they underestimated the damage that could be done.&quot;</p>
<p>In contrast, Nomura early in the saga announced a broad management shake-up that put corporate youngster Junichi Ujiie, 51, in the president's post and removed 15 executives including five vice presidents from its board.</p>
<p>&quot;Practice makes perfect,&quot; said one analyst, referring to Nomura's experience with a similar scandal six years years ago.</p>
<p>Ten arrests have already been made in the scandal, including Nomura's former president Hideo Sakamaki, three other Nomura executives and the four DKB officials.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have mobilised some 50 investigators, more than in the late 1980s Recruit shares-for-favours affair which brought down then-prime minister Noboru Takeshita, in a probe focusing on possible involvement by top DKB executives, Japanese media said.</p>
<p>Domestic media said prosecutors would soon investigate a former DKB vice president and several other top bank officials and that further criminal complaints were being contemplated.</p>
<p>In addition, both DKB and Nomura face as yet unspecified administrative penalties which could include the suspension of some business for a period of several months.</p>
<p>Both institutions are suffering from client defections and are being distracted from forward-looking strategic planning by the need for damage control, analysts said.</p>
<p>But some optimists said the two firms could turn adversity into opportunity if they took the right steps.</p>
<p>&quot;DKB doesn't seem to be doing anything really positive to resolve the situation,&quot; said Brian Waterhouse, financial analyst at HSCB James Capel.</p>
<p>&quot;But if the result is that a whole generation of bankers is swept away and they get a lot of new blood with new ideas for the future, it could end up quite positive for DKB,&quot; he said.</p>
