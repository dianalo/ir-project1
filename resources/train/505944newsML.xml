<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-04-14</dateline>

<p>Romania's over-the-counter (OTC) market rose by 1.5 percent on Monday from the previous session last Friday in volatile but active trading, an independent index showed.</p>
<p>The unofficial VAB-RASDAQ index, a capitalisation-weighted index of the OTC market, rose by 7.3 percent on the week to 2,217.5 points, showed data from  VANGUARD securities, which computes the index.</p>
<p>Trading on the RASDAQ -- the Romanian OTC system modelled on the U.S. NASDAQ -- was influenced by speculation on the 1996 results soon to be released of some companies.</p>
<p>That introduced a measure of volatility which traders said was certain to mark OTC trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Share prices were unstable, encouraging investors to speculate,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Most Romanian companies are expected to start announcing their financial results for last year starting April 15.</p>
<p>Romania's cement industry stayed at centre-stage, with investors focusing especially on cement maker Casial.</p>
<p>Casial was heavily traded, with 1.39 million shares changing hands. But it closed 10 lei weaker at 940 in line with the day's volatility.</p>
<p>Monday's RASDAQ volumes rose to 3.47 million shares from 2.62 million on Friday, with turnover up 600 million lei at 5.9 billion.</p>
<p>Another independent index, BIG-OTC, computed by  Bucharest Investment Group, showed a 2.87 percent rise at 1,436 points from Friday's close.</p>
<p>The Bucharest stock exchange had no trading on Monday. The bourse saw higher volumes and prices last week, with investors focusing on first-tier shares. ($=7,051 lei)</p>
