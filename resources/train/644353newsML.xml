<p>Four Russian journalists who were kidnapped and taken hostage in Chechnya over three months ago have been released, Russian news agencies reported early on Friday.</p>
<p>Interfax and Itar-Tass agencies, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), said the freed journalists would return to Moscow shortly.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass quoted one of the four freed hostages, its correspondent Nikolay Zagnoyko, as saying by telephone that all four were &quot;alive and well&quot;.</p>
<p>The other three journalists are from Radio Russia.</p>
<p>Interfax, quoting a source close to the leadership of the All-Russian Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, said no ransom had been paid to the kidnappers.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass reported that the four were expected to return to Moscow later on Friday.</p>
<p>Russian Mayak radio said the four were released at 5 a.m. (0100 gmt) on Friday.</p>
<p>It said they had been handed over to an official of the neighbouring republic of Dagestan and brought to the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala.</p>
