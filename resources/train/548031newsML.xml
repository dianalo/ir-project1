<p>Freight market sentiment and conditions were very mixed with generally poor levels obtained by most types of tonnage in the far east, but possibly better prospects reported for panamaxes in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Some brokers believed that panamax fortunes might also be potentially turning for the better in the east, although rates for capers and handies were unstable. The BFI was down 5 points to 1259.</p>
<p>GRAIN - Geepee were linked with Flag Emerald 111,064 dwt for US Gulf/Saudi Arabia grain for end May/first half June without further details. Cargill quoted a fresh caper enquiry for upto 90,000 dwcc US Gulf/Egypt for 15/23 May.</p>
<p>Panamaxes were in demand from Argentina. It emerged that Halla recently fixed Madonna Lily for 50,000/10 heavy grain Plate/China for 10/20 May at $24.00. Oldendorff booked the 1996-built Drin 73,000 dwt delivery Plate trip Singapore-Japan range at $12,500 daily plus about $260,000 bonus and Great Chance fixed the 1983-built Continental Spirit 65,000 dwt delivery Recalada to the same destination at $12,000 daily plus $250,000 bonus, both on subjects for first half May delivery and both at firmer levels than last done for comparable tonnage.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Hanjin took Eleranta 73,000 dwt delivery Nopac mid-May trip far East at close to $9,000 daily plus about $125,000 bonus, also on subjects, but at a weaker level than last fixed.</p>
<p>MINERALS - Little was reported about capers in the Atlantic. Cape Kestrel 160,849 dwt was rumoured covered for ironore from Brazil to China, and Cetragpa took Carbunesti for about 170,000 ironore Seven Islands to Kwangyang for 1/15 June at $9.40.</p>
<p>The far East appeared less satisfactory for owners. China Transport 151,738 dwt was rumoured fixed on subjects delivery Japan end May for an Australian round by Navix in the region of $14,500/14,750 daily, and British Steel were believed to have fixed about 150,00 ironore Port Hedland/Redcar and Immingham for 20/30 May at $8.55. Anangel Solidarity 160,500 dwt failed on subjects with Navix for 4-6 months at $15,750 daily and the fixture reported of Courageous 149,190 dwt to NYK for the same period at $14,500 daily was believed to have been completed a month ago.</p>
<p>Early panamaxes in the far East have run into increasing difficulties. NYK are said to have fixed both the 1995-built Panagiotis a 71,550 dwt and the 1996-built North Princess 71,290 dwt deliry E.Australia mid-may for trips to Japan at relatively weak levels close to $9,250 daily plus about $125,000 bonus. MOSK covered 2 orders for panamaxes for short periods in the east but details were not available.</p>
<p>Wadi Alkarnak 62,800 dwt was reported fixed for coal from Tanjong Bara to Taiwan at $3.50. Glencore booked a panamax from Richards Bay to China on private terms, and Elcano were said to have covered a panamax for coal from Roberts Bank to Gijon at $11.25.</p>
<p>Alumina was fixed by Klaveness with Daphne 64,873 dwt from Bunbury to Richards Bay at about $5.50.</p>
<p>In the South Atlantic IMT fixed Mercury Star 69,000 dwt delivery Vitoria for pigiron to US Gulf at $10,850 daily.</p>
<p>HANDIES -  The Baltic Handy Index was down 8 to 1090 reflecting generally softer conditions.</p>
<p>With the possible exception of the Continent, owners were struggling in most areas to obtain cover, let alone achieve as much as last done. Brokers reported early tonnage unfixed in the US Gulf and in the Plate and sluggish demand in the Far East, especially for smaller geared vessels.</p>
