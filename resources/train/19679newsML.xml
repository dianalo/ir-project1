<p>MINISTRY FOR AUTOMATIC APPROVAL TO 51 PCT FDI IN MINING</p>
<p>The Industry Ministry is advocating that mining and civil aviation proposals for foreign equity up to 51 percent be given automatic approval.

The present mining policy allows foreign equity up to 100 percent on a case- by-case basis. Foreign investment in airlines now is limited to 40 percent. Neither sector is allowed automatic approvals.</p>

<p>MOVE AIMED AT LIFTING SAGGING CONFIDENCE IN STOCK MARKET</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said he would announce measures to woo back small investors to the share market when he would reply to the budget debate in Parliament. Wooing small investors would be the key to stabilising the market, he said. The Finance Minister pointed out that an investment of over 413 billion rupees came to the share market in fiscal 1994/95 (April-March) when the small investors were active. It declined substantially in 1995/96 when these investors shied away from the market, he added.</p>

<p>IBRD WARNS OF GRAVE FISCAL IMBALANCE</p>
<p>The World Bank says the country is faced with serious fiscal imbalances. The 1996/97 budget may have partially corrected this, but the key to restoring balance lies in re-ordering centre state fiscal relations, says the bank. It has argued for increasing the fiscal correction to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Which means the Union government must reduce its fiscal deficit to around 3.5 percent of GDP from the current year's target of 5 percent. The World Bank also stresses that further financial sector reform is needed for fiscal consolidation.</p>
