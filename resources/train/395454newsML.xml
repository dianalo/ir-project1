<p>The high New Zealand dollar and low log prices are expected to drag Fletcher Challenge Forest Division's half year profit down to around NZ$25-35 million from $48 million when it reports next week, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>But, noting FCL Forests' position as a long-term play, they said the focus would be more on what can be gained by the recent acquisition of Forestry Corp of New Zealand (FCNZ), and the extent of synergy gains to be had from that purchase.</p>
<p>Additionally, the accent would not be on the profit, but on the forests' valuation.  </p>
<p>A consortium of Fletcher Challenge, Brierley Investments Ltd and China International Trust and Investment bought the then state-owned FCNZ for NZ$2.026 billion last August.</p>
<p>FCNZ's main asset is cutting rights to 188,000 hectares of mainly pine and fir forest in the central North Island. FCL Forests has the management contract for the estate.</p>
<p>While it was too soon to estimate the gains to be had from FCNZ, FCL Forests was neverthless expected to give some indication at Wednesday's results presentation.</p>
<p>Log prices had been soft. There were signs of a pickup in prices to Japan but not so with South Korea-bound logs.  </p>
<p>While it was highly unlikely FCL Forests would have a superior first half on an operating level, there would be a positive flow-on effect from FCNZ, David Stanley at Doyle Paterson Brown said</p>
<p>After abnormals, Stanley expects a profit of around NZ$25 million.</p>
<p>John Cairns at Cavill White Securities said FCL Forests was a much different proposition than the other FCL &quot;letter&quot; stocks because of its place as a long-term investment. &quot;I don't think investors need to concentrate on the short-term performance. It is very much a long-term investment when you look at the  </p>
<p>underlying asset value of the forestry estate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One Australian analyst, who declined to be named, expected the acquisition would muddy the waters somewhat while the asset was absorbed.</p>
<p>Since the purchase there had been a lot of &quot;front-ending&quot; -- harvesting -- of high value Douglas fir.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be a bit of a guessing game as to what the number is,&quot; he said. &quot;It's really what the value of the forest is, and that is more a function of the actual profile of the cut going forward,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The result could be &quot;crafted&quot; by virtue of the fact FCL Forests could change the mix of product that comes off a forest in terms of the tree type and area.</p>
<p>FCNZ was unusual in that FCL Forests could front-end the value chain by cutting the douglas fir over the course of this year and over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>&quot;Which basically will help their short-term profitability over this year, but actually what it is doing is crystallising a value that has already been reflected,&quot; he said.</p>
