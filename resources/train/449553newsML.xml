<p>Opposition militants in Zaire's capital Kinshasa planned to demonstrate on Wednesday in support of a vote in parliament demanding the sacking of Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo.</p>
<p>But supporters of Kengo and ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko, who like Kengo is out of the country, say that the vote was flawed as too few members of the transitional parliament took part.</p>
<p>On the war front, rebel leader Laurent Kabila declared a ceasefire around the captured city of Kisangani and said the capital Kinshasa and the diamond mining hub of Mbuji-Mayi in Kasai were his next targets.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to liberate Kinshasa and the people there need us,&quot; Kabila told 10,000 supporters in the eastern city of Goma.</p>
<p>Kengo, whose government has banned all protests for the duration of the war, was in Kenya for talks on Wednesday on the crisis in Zaire. His presence ends a Zairean boycott of two previous rounds of Nairobi talks on the crisis.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who has spent most of his time in Europe since cancer surgery there in August, is in hospital in Monaco.</p>
<p>The radical opposition led by Etienne Tshisekedi sponsored Tuesday's parliamentary motion of censure, which also called for a ceasefire and talks with Kabila.</p>
<p>Opposition spokesmen said as many as 462 of the assembly 738 members took part in the debate. Witnesses said a majority of those present approved the motion by acclamation, with some dissident Mobutu supporters voting with the opposition.</p>
<p>Supporters of Mobutu, most of whom boycotted Tuesday's debate, have a majority in parliament. They said the vote fell short of a three-quarters majority needed under Zaire's transitional constitution to sack a prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;You need three quarters of the signatures of parliament and today there were not even half of the members present,&quot; Anzuluni Bembe, a Mobutu supporter and parliament vice-president, said.</p>
<p>Opposition militants said the vote was valid and that students would demonstrate on Wednesday in support of it.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi, leader of Zaire's main political opposition, is a veteran opponent of Mobutu.</p>
<p>A national conference elected him prime minister in 1992 but Mobutu sacked him a year later. The transitional parliament elected Kengo in 1994 as a compromise candidate -- a move Tshiekedi and his followers have always bitterly contested.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi and his Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) enjoy widespread support among Kinshasa's poor.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, Kengo was due to hold talks in Nairobi on Wednesday with the presidents of Kenya, Zimbabwe, Congo and Cameroon and South Africa's deputy president, Thabo Mbeki.</p>
<p>In Paris, France and the United States, at loggerheads for months over central Africa, appealed jointly for a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Mobutu's son and spokesman said in the South of France that his father rejected all ideas of talks with Kabila.</p>
<p>Mobutu Nzanga rejected reports that his father was gravely ill, saying he was in permanent contact with his government in Kinshasa and planned to return home to Zaire.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Congo, the head of the local Red Cross said some members of Mobutu's family had joined a steady flow of Zaireans taking refuge there. She did not identify the family members.</p>
