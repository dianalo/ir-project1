<p>Greece's demure socialist premier Costas Simitis clashes on Friday with beefy conservative challenger Miltiades Evert in a live TV debate which could tip the scales in the neck-and-neck national election next week.</p>
<p>Simitis, 60, a mild-mannered pro-European technocrat will lock horns with outspoken New Democracy (ND) party leader Evert, 57, who delights in being described as &quot;the bulldozer&quot;.</p>
<p>Officials from both parties hope the duel will inspire the unusually apathetic Greek voters to cast their ballot in favour of their respective leaders in the September 22 vote, which the press has dubbed the &quot;couch elections.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will surely influence the undecided voters and create interest in the race,&quot; said George Levidis, ND's foreign press spokesman.</p>
<p>Simitis, who called the snap election confident he was leading the polls, has seen the conservatives rise dangerously close as election day approaches.</p>
<p>An ICAP poll on Thursday put the socialists ahead by 31.9 percent to the conservatives' 29.9. The DIMEL group gave the conservatives a 28.8-percent lead to the socialists' 27.3.</p>
<p>Simitis agreed to the TV debate provided that there would be no direct exchanges with Evert, saying he preferred to focus on views rather than bickering with his opponent.</p>
<p>&quot;He opted for an organised, structured dialogue because he wants to avoid a cock-fight,&quot; one of his advisors said.</p>
<p>But New Democracy has accused Simitis of avoiding a true verbal contest, for fear he would not be as impressive on TV.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear he fears a direct dialogue and prefers a podium speech in university-lecture style,&quot; Levidis said.</p>
<p>It is the first time in Greece that the lead election candidates cross swords U.S.-style on TV, leaving analysts baffled about how big an effect it could have on the voters.</p>
<p>The TV debate signals a change in elections style by the new generation of Greek politicians, who have opted for media-oriented campaigns rather than the traditional balcony speeches of their predecessors.</p>
<p>But with polls showing Greeks unimpressed by the characters and issues of the race, analysts say the modern campaign styles may have failed to inspire voters.</p>
<p>Past Greek elections have been dominated by flamboyant figures such as late socialist leader Andreas Papandreou and conservative party founder Constantine Karamanlis, who delighted in delivering rousing speeches before huge passionate crowds.</p>
<p>Simitis, who succeeded Papandreou in January, bears little resemblance to his maverick mentor, shying away from populist rhetoric and focusing on European Union targets.</p>
<p>He is also a far cry from his opponent, Evert, a jovial populist who offers rises in pensions and eagerly promises to satisfy local demands while on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>With both the main parties offering less than glamorous leaders, voters seem to be turning more than ever towards smaller parties, which have a surprisingly strong showing in opinion polls.</p>
<p>The two main contenders, who have been heavily coached before the showdown, will try to lure voters away from them with Friday's debate, which begins at 1800 GMT and is expected to last for more than an hour.</p>
