<p>Following are some of the main factors likely to affect Philippine stocks on Wednesday:</p>
<p>* Traders expect investors to remain cautious over equities until the peso-dollar rate stabilises and overnight rates are lowered.</p>
<p>* &quot;It would be a hard sell to convince investors to just plunge back into the market...To put it simply, the best tactic to be used is one of prudence and extra caution,&quot; said Jasmine Juanico, analyst at Anscor-Hagedorn Securities.</p>
<p>* Sun Hung Kai Securities said in its daily outlook that high interest rates and a weakening peso will remain a major cause for concern, keeping investors at bay in the coming days.</p>
<p>* On Tuesday, the Philippine composite index ended 54.87 points down at 2,655.86.</p>
<p>* The Dow Jones on Tuesday ended 52.73 points higher at 7,975.71. PLDT's ADR closed down $0/13 at $32/11.</p>
<p>* The Philippine peso ended unchanged at $29 to a dollar.</p>
<p>* The Philippine interbank call loan average slipped to 32.1875 percent vs 32.375 percent.</p>
<p>* The Philippine Central Bank said on Tuesday its studies showed the peso would settle at between 27.00 and 28.00 to the dollar in the third quarter of this year and at between 26.00 and 27.00 in the last quarter. It said its limited intervention in the foreign exchange markets was necessary to provide direction to an aimless market.</p>
<p>* Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP) president Deogracias Vistan said banks would reduce their over-the-counter (OTC) dollar selling rates after a public outcry over the high rates amid uncertainties in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>* Philippine banks raised their prime lending rates again on Tuesday after the Central Bank pushed up its reverse repo rates, treasurers and corporate bankers polled by Reuters said.</p>
<p>* The Central Bank raised on Tuesday its one-month reverse repo rate to 25 percent from 12.365 percent, a day after it offered two-week reverse repors at 25 percent.</p>
<p>* PLDT said it was expecting its net income to rise by 1.5 billion pesos for a full year following the sharp depreciation of the peso. PLDT executive vice-president Edgardo del Fonso said the company stood to gain 450 million pesos for every one peso depreciation.</p>
<p>* Benpres Holdings Inc said it issued derivatives to raise $60 million, a move analysts viewed as the first indication of how difficult it was for Philippine firms to attract money after the de facto peso devaluation.</p>
<p>* Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said high interest rates were temporary and would be brought down quickly as soon as the foreign exchange market stabilised.</p>
<p>* Philippine president Fidel Ramos backed a move by the Central Bank to probe and punish banks which may have been involved in currency manipulation in the days before the peso was effectively devalued.</p>
<p>* The National Power Corp said it would not raise rates in July despite the possibility of fuel price increases due to the weaker peso.</p>
<p>* Newspaper Malaya said Victorias Milling Corp will cut its staff by 51 percent, upgrade facilities, cut unnecessary costs and consolidate operations to pull it out of its financial problems.</p>
