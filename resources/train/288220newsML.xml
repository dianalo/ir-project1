<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Monday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British shares struggled higher in a sluggish day's trade on Monday but ended well short of last week's highs as another strong performance on Wall Street failed to shake off London's post-holiday torpor. Dealers said many investors seemed content to sit on the sidelines and watch, unnerved by fears of higher UK and U.S. interest rates and the risk of further Wall Street volatility.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks ended just short of the day's best levels, up 17 points at 4,106.5.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares closed bourse trade off day-highs but firmer on Monday following the stronger dollar and Friday's 1.58 percent gain on Wall Street. The DAX-30 index of leading German shares closed 22.04 points up at 2,881.32, after earlier hitting a session high of 2,899.40. March DAX futures were up 32.0 points at 2,914.0. In post-bourse trade the index up 26.94 to 2,890.20.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed on a strong note, but failed to break through resistance at 2,306, as gains on Wall Street boosted the CAC-40 index, traders said. Dollar strength, which helps investment inflows, and hopes of continued French interest rate cuts supported the Paris market. But recent sharp swings on the Dow also induced a note of caution.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 23.91 points or 1.05 percent at 2,306.67, while the CAC-40 futures contract was up at 2,316 from 2,304 on Friday's settle.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended weaker on Monday in a market which favoured industrial shares but was negative toward banks and insurers. The broad SPI fell 5.92 points to 2,506.22 and the blue-chip SMI was down 16.3 to 3,923.8.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed the first trading day of the year modestly higher on Monday, as selective buying of shares in blue-chip companies helped the market, which was still suffering from an uncertain outlook for the economy. The benchmark Nikkei 225 average finished up 84.65 points or 0.44 percent at 19,446.00.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks climbed 1.67 percent to a much higher close on Monday, lifted by positive sentiment surrounding the property and finance sectors and underpinned by a rebound on Wall Street. The Hang Seng Index jumped 221.14 points to end at the day high of 13,443.93.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian share market ended with modest gains on Monday with a rebounding Wall Street providing the inspiration, However, early strength was sapped by a gold sector that dived 1.6 percent after the bullion price tumbled offshore. The All Ordinaries index added 10.3 points to 2,409.8.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African gold stocks felt the brunt of a weak bullion price which on Monday sank to its lowest level in over three years. Almost 2.5 percent was shaved off the value of the gold index, with dealers predicting further downside for the metal and shares on Tuesday. The gold index fell 2.48 percent or 36.2 points to 1,421.8 -- its lowest level in a year. Dealers said there was, however, no heavy sell-off of gold shares. Share weakness was also capped by the rand which spent most of the day holding weaker against the U.S. dollar above the 4.70 level.</p>
<p>Industrial shares ended a touch firmer retracing off firmer morning levels on futures-related basket trading and held steady for the afternoon in quiet dealings. The index ended six points better at 7,882.5.</p>
