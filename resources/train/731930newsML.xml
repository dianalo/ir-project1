<headline>Slovenia shares end up, some correction seen likely.</headline>

<p>Slovenia's SBI share index powered on upwards for the seventh consecutive session on Wednesday, but traders predicted some correction was likely in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend has been upward in the past two weeks with some corrections. It is hard to say how long this optimism will last but profit taking is likely to lower prices,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The SBI index rose 0.47 percent or 6.85 points to 1,476.70. This week alone, the index gained 5.1 percent.</p>
<p>Market participants said Tuesday's invitation by the EU for Slovenia to join enlargement talks, did not have a significant influence on today's trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The invitation was expected and already factored into previous rises, but over the long term it is definitely a good sign for future foreign buyers,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate international investors currently account for about 60 percent of the volume on the main market.</p>
<p>Overall 15 shares rose, four fell and one was flat, while eight were untraded. Turnover eased to 529.8 million tolars from 532.5 million.</p>
<p>Drug maker Lek was the most actively traded share, firming 0.29 percent to 35,000 tolars on volume of 254.5 million tolars.</p>
<p>&quot;Some traders forecast Lek could reach as much as 90,000 tolars, but I think the price around 40,000 is much more realistic and could happen soon,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Brokerage Dadas was the top gainer, jumping 8.88 percent to 6,500 tolars on volume of only one share.</p>
<p>Food producer Droga was the leading decliner, falling 1.64 percent to 30,000 tolars on volume of 69 shares.</p>
<p>Petrol trader Petrol, which was among most active shares, jumped 4.47 percent to 21,950 tolars on volume of 8,330 tolars for total turnover of 180.4 million tolars.</p>
