<p>Practice repairs on the damaged Mir space station, delayed after the Russian commander developed an irregular heartbeat, have been set for July 21, flight director Vladimir Solovyov said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a training session on Monday. After the training we will decide conclusively on the date (for the actual repairs) with our NASA colleagues,&quot; he told reporters. The decision on who would do the repairs would be made at about the same time, another space official said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The exact date and who will carry out the repairs will probably be known by the end of the week or later but training will proceed in the meantime,&quot; Deputy Flight Commander Sergei Krikalyov said.</p>
<p>Solovyov said NASA's representative at Mission Control outside Moscow had spoken to American astronaut Michael Foale, who he said did not see any particular difficulties in taking Tsibliyev's place for the electrical repairs if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;The next cosmonauts are also preparing on Earth to do the repairs, as a backup plan,&quot; Solovyov said. A three-man Russian-French relief crew is due to arrive at Mir in a Soyuz spacecraft on August 7.</p>
<p>Doctors on Tuesday prescribed sedatives and medicine to steady Tsibliyev's heartbeat after a cardiovascular problem showed up in tests on Sunday, but Solovyov said he did not need to be evacuated. &quot;There are no medical details or information that he needs to be immediately returned to Earth.&quot;</p>
