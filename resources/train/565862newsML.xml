<p>A hacker broke into the Polish cabinet's internet website at the weekend, altering its heading to read &quot;Hackpublic of Poland&quot; and &quot;Government Disinformation Centre&quot;, a newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Internet users seeking information from the prime minister's office found themselves referred to the site of Playboy magazine by the unknown hacker, who signed him or herself &quot;Damage.Inc&quot;, the daily Gazeta Wyborcza said.</p>
<p>An official in the office which produced the government website told Reuters on Wednesday it had been withdrawn pending the provision of new security codes.</p>
<p>A copy of the altered version could still be viewed on http://www.software.com.pl/intdev/news/welcomep.html, the server of the Net Security Institute (IBS) in Warsaw.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted government spokeswoman Aleksandra Jakubowska as saying that the cabinet website was not connected to the government's internal computer network so there was no danger of using the internet to access government secrets.</p>
<p>She told a news briefing that confidential documents were in any case held on laptops to provide further guarantees.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really hard to break into this kind of equipment, because it is not in any network,&quot; she said.</p>
