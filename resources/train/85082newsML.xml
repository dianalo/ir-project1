<title>JAPAN: Japan banks forgive loans to failed mortgage firms.</title>

<p>Major Japanese banks said on Monday they would forgive a total of 1.7 trillion yen ($15.3 billion) worth of loans they had extended to failed mortgage firms, but they played down any major damage from the action to the nation's financial system.</p>
<p>Sakura Bank, Daiwa Bank, Sanwa Bank, Asahi bank and eight other major Japanese banks separately announced that they would forgive loans worth 1.68 trillion yen ($15.1 billion) they had extended to mortgage firms liquidated under a controversial government scheme.</p>
<p>After months of haggling in parliament, Japan adopted a framework earlier this year allowing for the use of 685 billion yen ($6.17 billion) of taxpayers' money to help wind up the mortgage firms, known as &quot;jusen&quot;.</p>
<p>The jusen, a symbol of the fragility of the nation's financial system, went insolvent and sank under the weight of rash property loans made during the &quot;bubble&quot; of inflated asset prices of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Major commercial banks founded the mortgage firms in the 1970s and the banks and other financial institutions had been lenders to them.</p>
<p>The banks said they had forgiven the loans to jusen just before closing their books for the half year to September 30, but they denied any negative impact from the action on their earnings for the full year to next March 31.</p>
<p>Sakura Bank, for example, said in a statement it had forgiven loans of 280.23 billion yen ($2.52 billion) which it had extended to two failed jusen -- Nippon Housing Loan Co Ltd and Housing Loan Service Co Ltd.</p>
<p>But it said forgiving the loans would not affect its earnings for the full year because it had completed write-off procedures for the jusen loans in the previous financial year.</p>
<p>Sanwa Bank Ltd said it had forgiven 242.6 billion yen ($2.18 billion) in loans to Nippon Housing Loan Co Ltd. It also denied any adverse effect on its earnings forecast for the current business year for the same reason as Sakura.</p>
<p>Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd, meanwhile, said it had provided 42.32 billion yen ($381 million) to support its unit Nippon Trust Bank Ltd, which had forgiven a similar sum in loans it extended to Juso Inc, one of the seven failed jusen.</p>
<p>Nippon Trust said the loan forgiveness would not have an impact on its earnings for the full business year.</p>
<p>It said it would include the financial support from the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi as extraordinary profit in its accounts for the six months that ended on Monday. ($1=111 yen)</p>
