<headline>IPE Brent slips lower as Iraq oil looms.</headline>

<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures continued their downwards drift on Wednesday as physical crude markets weakened in the face of imminent Iraqi oil exports, traders and brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like Iraqi oil is on the way and that has hit the cash market - sentiment is a bit weaker,&quot; one IPE broker said.</p>
<p>September Brent was 24 cents a barrel weaker at $19.28 at 1135 GMT while August gas oil was $1.75 weaker at $174.50.</p>
<p>Brent contracts for differences (cfds) for next week were 10 to 12 cents weaker - indicating weakness in the price of prompt physical North Sea cargoes.</p>
<p>Iraq's oil minister Muhammed Rasheed told reporters in Baghdad on Wednesday his country would begin exports under the latest oil-for-food deal with the U.N. in mid-August.</p>
<p>He indicated that Iraq's export capacity stood at 1.8 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>&quot;This all makes it a bit volatile but the news is basically already in the market,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers saw technical support at $19.00 and then $18.80 a barrel, with next resistance up at $19.64.</p>
