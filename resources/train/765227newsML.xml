<p>Plasti-Line Inc said Wednesday its chairman and chief executive officer, James Martin, has proposed a merger in which a private corporation he plans to form would buy Plasti-Line shares at $13.50 a share in cash.</p>
<p>Plasti-Line said the new corporation would have certain key management executives of the company as shareholders.  </p>
<p>The company said Martin, who currently owns 46.4 percent of Plasti-Line's outstanding common stock, has told its board that he has no current intent to sell his stake to a third party. The shares Martin holds include those issuable upon the exercise of certain stock options, it said.</p>
<p>The company said its board has authorized a special committee of independent directors to negotiate with the proposed acquiring corporation and to determine whether to approve the acquisition on behalf of the board.</p>
<p>Plasti-Line said that there can be no assurance that any transaction will occur.</p>
<p>Plasti-Line designs, markets, produces and installs interior and exterior brand identity signs and point of purchase marketing products and systems for retailers and manufacturers.</p>
