<p>LCI International Inc said on Friday it expected to post a 75 to 80 percent increase in operating earnings in 1996 and a 65 percent increase in revenue.</p>
<p>Brian Thompson, chief executive of the long-distance company, said he never told analysts to expect lower growth from the company. He said he was standing by his long-term forecast of 30 to 40 percent annual revenue growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I told them I never changed that (forecast),&quot; Thompson told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said he expected the company to put in a strong performance in 1997, too.  </p>
<p>LCI's stock plunged in December after conversations with analysts were interpreted as indicating slower revenue growth. Thompson said he was unable initially to correct the impression because the company was in a quiet period.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't say we were going to drop in the future. As it turns out, the company will do very well this year (just finished),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will end up around 65 percent (in revenues) for the year. Operating earnings are going to be up even more than that -- they are going to be closer to 75 or 80 percent,&quot; Thompson said.</p>
