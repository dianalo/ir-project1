<title>UK: Dlr/mark steadies in Europe, dlr/yen firms anew.</title>
<headline>Dlr/mark steadies in Europe, dlr/yen firms anew.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-29</dateline>

<p>The dollar steadied after earlier cracking key chart support around 1.5160 marks but it pushed ahead again on the yen to its highest level since April 1993.</p>
<p>Attention swung back to dollar/mark during this morning's slide but later in the day traders started to eye dollar/yen again, pondering the sustainability of its rise.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark was around a pfennig down at 1.5097/02 after sagging to a low of 1.5061, compared with Monday's close of 1.5174/81. On the yen it rallied to a late 113.97/07, the peak was 114.53, compared with Monday's 114.10/20 close.  </p>
<p>Japanese Finance Minister Wataro Kubo said overnight that the yen's current movements reflected fundamentals and the situation did not warrant special attention.</p>
<p>This was followed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that he was not concerned about the dollar's recent rise. Both helped fuel the dollar's rise on the yen with foreasters now talking about 115 or even 120.</p>
<p>&quot;The implication from Kubo's remarks is that there may be some acceptable range being monitored and the dollar/yen spot is still within that range of G7 comfort,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch.  </p>
<p>But with some wild forecasts for dollar/yen flying about, traders and analysts were starting to ponder the sustainability of its rise.</p>
<p>&quot;Historical intervention patterns suggest levels above 120 would prove unacceptable to G7, as we have seen BoJ/Fed dollar selling intervention not far above that level and as recently as 1993,&quot; Prendergast said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on dollar/mark there was a barrage of comments from German officials to cope with but after the dust settled the feeling was that the overall hint was that there is a possibility of a further Germany easing.  </p>
<p>The mark was firm after Germany's top economic research institutes forecast healthy economic activity and a possible rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>Germany's six top research institutes predicted 1996 GDP growth at 1.5 pct, twice previous forecasts, and said Germany may not meet EMU debt and deficit criteria in 1997.</p>
<p>Late in the day the mark leapt over half a centime against the French franc amid talk of a report saying the EU accounting commission is to rule against French deficit reduction plans to meet EMU criteria.  </p>
<p>There was no confirmation of the report but mark/Paris jumped to 3.3869 from around 3.3810, although by 1643 GMT it had settled back to 3.3836/41.</p>
<p>The EU commission said no decision had been taken yet on the French budget plan.</p>
<p>U.S. data today had little impact but, if anything, pointed to no Fed tightening this year, analysts said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Q3 employment cost index rose 0.6 percent, having been expected to match August's 0.8 percent rise. The consumer confidence index came in weaker than expected at 106.2 in October after a revised 111.8 in September.  </p>
<p>&quot;The employment cost index is soft and should be taken as a further reason for expecting no Fed tightening at the November 13 FOMC meeting,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica.</p>
<p>Sterling shed around two pfennigs on the day against the mark to 2.4290/95 marks versus an opening 2.4580 level and Monday's close of 2.4485/92.</p>
<p>UK Chancellor Kenneth Clarke holds the monthly monetary meeting with Bank of England governor Eddie George tomorrow but no change in rates is anticipated.</p>
