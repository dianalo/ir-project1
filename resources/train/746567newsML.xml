<p>Warner-Lambert Co said Tuesday it expected earnings to grow faster in the third quarter, allowing it to eventually reach per-share earnings of $3.20 for the entire year.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to a rapid acceleration in earnings growth beginning in the third quarter,&quot; it said in statement, partly attributing it to the introduction of two new drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;Based upon the success of these products, we believe earnings per share of $3.20 for 1997 is achievable,&quot; it added.  </p>
<p>First Call's consensus among analysts forecast earnings of $0.77 per share for the third quarter. It also projected $3.21 for the year.</p>
<p>The company, hich makes pharmaceutical, health care and confectionery products, reported a profit of $0.85 per share for the second quarter on sales of $1.97 billion, compared to $0.79 on $1.79 billion for the same period last year.</p>
<p>It said sales growth during the period was driven by the U.S. launch of drugs Lipitor and Rezulin in the first quarter. The first is an agent that helps lower cholesterol, while the latter is a type two diabetes drug.  </p>
<p>Warner-Lambert said global pharmaceutical sales rose 34 percent total $825 million in the second quarter. U.S. sales for those products were up 65 percent to $461 million and seven percent higher at $364 million in foreign markets.</p>
<p>It said sales growth in pharmaceuticals was driven by the two drugs and a anticonvulsant called Neurontin. Lipitor had worldwide sales of $151 million, while Rezulin had $79 million, it added.</p>
<p>The company said its consumer health care products had $675 million in global sales in the second quarter, five percent lower than the same quarter a year ago. U.S. sales in product were four percent down at $342 million and down five percent to $333 million abroad, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;Second quarter segment results reflect the change in accounting for the product Zovirax,&quot; it said, explaining how the drug was no longer included in consolidated worldwide sales as a result of the 1996 restructuring of a joint venture deal with Glaxo Wellcome.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert said confectionery sales reached $467 million, &quot;slightly ahead of last year's quarter&quot;. U.S. sales rose five percent to $145 million and foreign sales fell two percent at $322 million, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;This performance is attributable primarily to Japan, where sales declined due to overall weakness in the gum and mint categories, intense competition and the decreased value of the yen,&quot; it said.</p>
