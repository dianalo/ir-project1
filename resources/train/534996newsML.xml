<title>KENYA: Foreign investors eye stake in Kenya telecoms industry.</title>

<p>Foreign investors are lining up for a stake in Kenya's telecommunications industry following last year's successful flotation of national carrier Kenya Airways.</p>
<p>British Telecoms, American giant AT&amp;T and companies from Malaysia, France and Japan have all met executives from the Kenya Posts &amp; Telecommunications Corp (KP&amp;TC) and privatisation board officials recently to discuss the sale.</p>
<p>But telecoms and financial analysts warn that investors are alarmed by suggestions from senior Kenyan officials that local investors should be given priority.</p>
<p>Interest has been heightened by the publication two weeks ago of a bill that seeks to divide KP&amp;TC into separate posts and telecommunications firms and also create a sector regulator.</p>
<p>&quot;Kenya will not be without international interest. Many companies are examining the progress and what stake they can bid for,&quot; said British diplomat Steve Martin.</p>
<p>&quot;They seek to see a clear way for foreign investment as they make their decisions,&quot; added Martin, commercial secretary at the British High Commission in Nairobi.</p>
<p>KP&amp;TC has already privatised its directory publishing and paging services and is currently in talks with British firm Vodafone on setting up a cellular phone company. It is also talking to a Canadian company about replacing land lines with a radio network.</p>
<p>But the biggest prize remains Telkoms Kenya, to be hived off from KP&amp;TC when, if as expected, parliament approves the bill.</p>
<p>Nairobi Stock Exchange Chief Executive Job Kihumba said investors saw the partial sale of Telkoms as the next logical step by the government following the success of the 1996 flotation of Kenya Airways.</p>
<p>The Kenya Airways sale was boosted by a purchase of a 26 percent stake for $26 million by Royal Dutch Airlines KLM and a government decision to float another 51 percent through the Nairobi Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>KP&amp;TC Managing Director Jan Mutai told Reuters that KP&amp;TC planned to sell only around 30 percent of the government stake in Telkoms -- and that to &quot;local strategic investors&quot;.</p>
<p>World Bank official Ian Knapps rejected that position as not reflecting government thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;Strategic alliances are an option. A strategic partner brings in expertise and funds and clearly in this case it does not preclude foreign investors,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said consultants -- paid for by the World Bank -- had already been identified and would be engaged to examine privatisation options.</p>
<p>According to KP&amp;TC public relations manager Dick Rayori, the company -- which has a 28,000-strong workforce -- posted after-tax profits of 3.6 billion shillings ($67.92 million) in 1995/96.</p>
<p>He could not give comparative figures for 1994/95 or a forecast for 1996/97 and would not estimate the company's net worth, although KPMG Peat Marwick is currently auditing KP&amp;TC assets.</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund senior adviser Hiroyuki Hino said on a visit to Kenya last week that progress in privatising KP&amp;TC was too slow.</p>
<p>Kenya's privatisation board has set December 1998 as a target date for the sale.</p>
