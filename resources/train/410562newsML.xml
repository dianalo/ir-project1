<p>Chicago received some good news from the rating agencies this week when Standard &amp; Poor's Corp placed a positive outlook on the city's single-A general obligation rating and Moody's Investors Service refined its rating to A2 from A.</p>
<p>Walter Knorr, Chicago's chief financial officer, said Friday  both rating developments were positive.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're doing a very good job of managing our finances and I think they recognize that,&quot; he said, referring to Standard &amp; Poor's positive outlook.</p>
<p>As for the Moody's rating refinement, Knorr, who had expressed concern in the past over the agency's decision to add numerical modifiers to all of its ratings, said he considered the A2 rating to be a &quot;positive refinement.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, Knorr pointed out that &quot;there is certainly a translation problem&quot; in going from Moody's previous rating system to the new system, which added the &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; modifiers.</p>
<p>For its part, Standard &amp; Poor's said it anticipates upgrading Chicago's rating over the next three years if the city is &quot;able to maintain strong fund balances, demonstrate enhanced financial flexibility and reduce relative direct debt levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe O'Keefe, a director at Standard &amp; Poor's, added the rating agency would also be looking for improvement in Chicago's unfunded pension liability and reviewing its performance in a recessionary environment.</p>
<p>Moody's pointed out that while the city has enjoyed savings from workforce reductions, those options are now more limited. It also said the &quot;economically vulnerable sources are a large revenue stream component&quot; for the city.</p>
<p>The ratings were released in anticipation of a $75 million GO bond issue for library improvements Chicago plans to sell Wednesday with LaSalle Capital Markets as the senior manager.</p>
<p>Knorr said the issue will likely carry insurance from Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.</p>
<p>Other debt issues in the pipeline include $125 million of sales tax revenue bonds for the city's capital program in mid-March, and $75 million of single-family mortgage revenue bonds at the end of March.</p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is the senior manager for the sales tax revenue bonds, while George K. Baum &amp; Co. will lead the housing bond issue, according to Knorr.</p>
