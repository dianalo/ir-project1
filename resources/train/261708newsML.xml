<headline>Italy piles on pressure to spare death row man.</headline>

<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi appealed to the governor of the U.S. state of Virginia on Tuesday to spare the life of a convicted murderer whose imminent execution has shocked Italy.</p>
<p>The letter to Governor George Allen, released by Prodi's office, was the latest shot in a drive to secure clemency for Joseph O'Dell, 55, that has involved Pope John Paul, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, parliament, lawyers and rights groups.</p>
<p>&quot;I am appealing to you personally to consider the possibility of suspending the execution fixed for December 18 to allow new elements announced by O'Dell's defence to be examined,&quot; Prodi wrote in his letter to Allen.</p>
<p>&quot;You will understand that whatever decision you make will cause great emotion among the public in my country.&quot;</p>
<p>O'Dell, convicted of the rape and murder in 1985 of 44-year-old secretary Helen Schartner of Virginia Beach, Virginia, is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He and his supporters say that post-trial DNA testing shows that blood stains on his clothing do not match the victim's and want the case re-opened. They say the evidence has been ruled out by judges on a legal technicality.</p>
<p>The newspapers La Repubblica and Il Giornale on Tuesday said they had interviewed O'Dell by telephone at the Mecklenburg Correctional Center in Boydton, Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;I am terrified. I don't deserve to die because I'm innocent,&quot; Il Giornale quoted O'Dell as saying.</p>
<p>He said he had asked for his sperm to be frozen in the event of his execution so his wife, Lori Urs, could have his child.</p>
<p>La Reppublica quoted O'Dell as saying he wanted the Pope, who has pleaded for a reprieve, to pray for him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice all the same to know that I won't be dying alone like the other people in this death house where they go to their execution in silence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>O'Dell's defence team has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay of execution as well as seeking clemency from Allen.</p>
<p>The campaign, much of it conducted over the Internet, has made front page news in Italy, which is a strong supporter of the push for a worldwide abolition of capital punishment.</p>
<p>Virtually all reports have accepted O'Dell's protestations of innocence almost uncritically and argued that as long as there is doubt in the case he should not be executed.</p>
<p>Several rights groups, including the anti-death penalty organisation Hands Off Cain and Amnesty International, were planning a torchlit vigil for O'Dell outside the U.S. embassy on Rome's Via Veneto on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>A spokesman at the embassy said a &quot;good number&quot; of Italians had telephoned or sent faxes calling for O'Dell's reprieve.</p>
<p>&quot;As the O'Dell case regards solely the state of Virginia and not the federal government we are passing these on to the state authorities,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>O'Dell's case has not so far drawn much publicity in the United States, where 38 states have the death penalty.</p>
<p>Texas leads the nation with 107 executions since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, followed by Florida with 38 and Virginia with 36.</p>
<p>The eighth person executed in Virginia this year, the most in any U.S. state in 1996, died by lethal injection on Monday.</p>
<p>Ronald Lee Hoke Sr. was convicted of raping, robbing and stabbing a woman to death in 1985.</p>
