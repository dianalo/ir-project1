<p>Intervention by a multi-billion baht support fund this week helped curb further steep falls on the flagging Thai stock market, now at three-year-lows, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>They also believed that the majority of the 15.7 billion baht (US$628 million) fund set up by brokers and bankers in August has yet to be used, leaving it with enough firepower to intervene again in the future.</p>
<p>Analysts estimated around nine billion to 10 billion baht remains.</p>
<p>The fund, which has been relatively inactive since it was established, began buying this week after a six percent fall on the market on Monday.</p>
<p>It also swung into action after calls from Finance Minister Bodi Chunnananda that local funds help shore up the battered market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;You could see from the way the market has moved the fund has been much more active this week,&quot; said Youssef Abboud, an investment analyst from Wall Street Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been helping busily, supporting the market more and more, normally towards the close, but sometimes throughout a session if its heading down.&quot;</p>
<p>The market has lately been depressed by rumours, worries over what kind of government will take power after general elections on November 17, a slowing economy and flight by foreign investors reducing their exposure in Thai stocks.</p>
<p>The Thai stock index closed 14.58 points down at 918.42 by the lunch break on Friday.</p>
<p>Brokers said the fund, administered by three of the largest local asset management companies, BBL Asset Management, Thai Farmers Asset Management and Thai Asia Mutual Fund, has been buying blue chip stocks since Tuesday at a support level of 930-960.</p>
<p>Although asset managers refused to comment on specific fund intervention, Thawat Angsuwarangsi, managing director of BBL Asset Management, said this week the majority of its fund's money was not yet on the market.</p>
<p>One securities firm's research head said: &quot;I think the fund still has plenty of firepower left, when they have come into the market it has tended to be at the end of the day to buy small blocks of shares to push the market up before the close.&quot;</p>
<p>Fund intervention became apparent on Tuesday, when local mutual funds were net purchasers by 234.97 million baht, stock exchange data show. Local funds were also net buyers by 822.4 million baht during the first week of October.</p>
<p>The fund was active again on Wednesday with local funds net buyers by 179.09 million baht. On Thursday, funds were net sellers by 184.09 million baht, according to exchange data.</p>
<p>Net sales of 689.95 million baht from local funds in September suggests support purchasing during the month was limited. It was heaviest during the last four days of the second week when the market range was 986-1,039.</p>
<p>Intervention in August was slight, with buying said to be confined to a three-day period after the fund's creation. The market range then was 1,067-1,095.</p>
