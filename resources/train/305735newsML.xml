<p>Indonesia's leading environmental group said on Tuesday it hoped the huge Busang gold find in East Kalimantan province would not create social and environmental problems for the local people.</p>
<p>Emmy Hafild, director of the environmental group Walhi, said she believed the extensive media coverage given to the find would encourage the two Canadian companies involved to develop the find carefully so as not to create friction with the local people.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope there won't be any confrontation. I think they will be more careful, especially because of the extensive media attention,&quot; Hafild told a news conference on the sidelines of an environmental seminar organised by Walhi.</p>
<p>The Busang find is estimated to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold and is valued at more than $21 billion at current prices.</p>
<p>Hafild said the experience of Irian Jaya's Amungme people, whose tribal area surrounds the giant Tembagapura copper and gold mine run by PT Freeport Indonesia, should not happen again.</p>
<p>An Amungme tribal leader last year launched a $6 billion class action in the United States against the mining company's parent, McMoRan Copper and Gold, accusing the company of being involved in &quot;eco-terrorism&quot; and &quot;cultural genocide&quot;.</p>
<p>The case is still before the courts.</p>
<p>&quot;We will help the people in the Busang area to make sure that their voices are heard. We are still collecting information on the number of people there who will be affected by the project,&quot; Hafild said.</p>
<p>A government official said on Monday Indonesia's Mines and Energy Ministry was still studying a joint submission from Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp outlining their agreement on the Busang gold discovery.</p>
<p>The official said the government could accept the agreement between the two parties on the understanding that they wished to split the richest parts of Busang 67.5 percent for Barrick, 22.5 percent for Bre-X and 10 percent for the Indonesian government.</p>
