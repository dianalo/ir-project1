<p>King Hussein of Jordan left Amman on Tuesday for the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks with President Hosni Mubarak aimed at lending fresh impetus to stalled Middle East negotiations.</p>
<p>Jordanian officials said the two leaders would try to find ways to bridge gaps between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who have yet to seal an accord on a long overdue Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting is aimed at coordination and moving the peace process forward,&quot; one official said of the meeting, agreed in a telephone call late on Monday.</p>
<p>The king, seen as Israel's closest Arab ally since his 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish state, has distanced himself in recent weeks from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after Netanyahu opened a tunnel entrance close to Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem in September, sparking widespread violence.</p>
<p>Jordan, granted special status for overseeing parts of Arab East Jerusalem under the 1994 agreement, was not consulted ahead of the tunnel opening.</p>
<p>Since then King Hussein has expressed anxiety about renewed violence in the region if Israel does not honour its peace accords with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher said the king's meeting with Mubarak was part of closer coordination between the two Arab states since the recent crisis.</p>
<p>He said if agreement was finally reached on the Hebron redeployment, now seven months overdue, Israel could not afford to drag its feet over implementation of other parts of an interim Palestinian self rule accord signed by the PLO and Israel's previous Labour government.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to go beyond the agreement on Hebron. This should not be looked upon as the end of the line,&quot; Muasher told Reuters. &quot;We need to go beyond this to implement the rest of the agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>On Sunday King Hussein called Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to urge them to agree on the Hebron redeployment so they could move ahead with implementation of the interim accord.</p>
<p>King Hussein was accompanied to Egypt by Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti, officials said.</p>
