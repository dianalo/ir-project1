<title>PAKISTAN: Pakistan begins Afghan mediation mission.</title>

<p>Pakistan sent a senior diplomat to northern Afghanistan on Tuesday on a mission to persuade warring factions to hold peace talks which Islamabad plans to host, government officials said.</p>
<p>The officials, quoted by the state media, said Iftikhar Murshed, a senior official in the foreign ministry, would meet northern opposition leader General Abdul Malik and his allies in an alliance fighting the dominant Taleban Islamic movement.</p>
<p>Murshed left for the opposition-held northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif after holding talks with Taleban officials in the southern town of Kandahar on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pakistani diplomat is believed to be taking a set of peace proposals from the Taleban leadership to the opposition alliance,&quot; the official APP news agency said.</p>
<p>It quoted Pakistani officials as saying Islamabad was not proposing any agreement of its own but was just to make the warring sides agree on a minimum agenda to initiate a dialogue.</p>
<p>Last month, Islamabad proposed hosting a conference of Afghanistan's five immediate neighbours -- Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan -- and the United States and Russia under U.N. auspices to find ways for peace in the war-shattered country.</p>
<p>Pakistan recognised the Taleban government in late May after the purist Islamic militia briefly captured Mazar-i-Sharif with Malik's help and was followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Islamabad is accused by ethnic Uzbek and Tajik opposition factions of helping the mainly ethnic Pashtun Taleban, which controls more than two-thirds of Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul.</p>
<p>Murshed's trip to the north comes a day after a former Afghan president, Sibghatullah Mojadidi, left Pakistan for his own peace mission to north Afghanistan via Tehran.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati held talks with Mojadidi on Tuesday, Iran's official IRNA news agency said.</p>
<p>Mojadidi launched his mission, aimed at securing a ceasefire and an exchange of prisoners, after consulting the Taleban and Malik, who controls the ethnic Uzbek forces in the north, according to a spokesman for the former president.</p>
<p>The Taleban want Malik to free hundreds of Taleban fighters captured in Mazar-i-Sharif last month.</p>
<p>The Taleban captives include some key leaders who had gone to Mazar-i-Sharif for talks with Malik, who had made a short-lived alliance with the Taleban against former opposition warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum.</p>
<p>Malik turned on the Taleban at the end of May, linking up with a Shi'ite Moslem Hezb-i-Wahdat faction to drive them from Mazar-i-Sharif after 15 hours of street fighting.</p>
