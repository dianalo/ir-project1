<text>
<p>Zimbabwe industrial shares closed lower on Tuesday despite enjoying fairly active trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said the index had suffered a little profit-taking after recent record highs but that some consolidation was positive for the market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been running on a bull trip lately and so some guys are probably looking to take a bit of profit,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;A slightly weaker close like this is not a bad thing and gives the market time to consolidate a little at its new levels. But it probably won't last very long and then we'll see it take off again,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dealers said that some investors were selling stock to accumulate funds with which to take advantage of new issues coming on to the market over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>They added that fundamentals remained strong and good company results were likely to fuel a continued bull run.</p>
<p>The 57-share industrial index shed 43.30 points to 10,663.57. Delta lost 20 cents to 1,700, Dunlop cut 40 cents to 200 and Bicaf lost 100 cents to 300 cents.</p>
<p>But Rothmans put on 200 cents to 4,700 cents, Meikles climbed 150 cents to 2,600 cents and Natfoods rose 20 cents to 625 cents.</p>
<p>The seven-share mining index closed 2.81 points up at 889.05. Ashanti was unchanged at 10,000 cents, while Bindura added 15 cents to 700 cents and Falgold shed 10 cents to 60 cents.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the mining index was likely to remain static as long as the dull bullion price dampened sentiment.</p>
