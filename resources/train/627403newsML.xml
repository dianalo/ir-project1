<headline>German IBIS DAX index ends two percent lower.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A jittery German market ended the day two percent lower, with sentiment hit by a slide on Wall Street, vague uncertainty about the future of EMU, debt market weakness and impending elections in France.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index, which gauges trade in 30 German blue-chips, ended the day down 72.65 points, or two percent, at 3,562.73 points.</p>
<p>Earlier, traders were fearful of what would happen on Wall Street on opening after U.S. chip maker Intel Corp issued a profit warning. Wall St opened lower, but the IBIS DAX recouped some losses later, as the fall had been mostly priced in.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing the impact of the whole picture here. We had Intel, there's the EMU uncertainty after the Waigel/Bundesbank row, the elections in France. Also there aren't many people around today, because of the holiday yesterday,&quot; a Munich trader said.</p>
<p>Intel said that revenues and net income in its fiscal second quarter would fall below expectations due to weaker-than-projected demand, while athletic footwear and apparel company Nike Inc also issued a profit warning.</p>
<p>The Nike profit warning hit sportswear maker Puma AG particularly hard early on, but the shares came off lows and ended down 2.10 marks, or 3.75 percent, at 52.50 marks.</p>
<p>Its rival Adidas AG also recovered to end down 2.75 marks at 181 marks.</p>
<p>Otherwise, losses in the share market did not really restrict themselves to particular sectors, though some were hit worse than others.</p>
<p>&quot;The chemicals have been hit hard, and the future has come off considerably, which suggests that there is a lot of derivative-led trade out there at the moment,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>BASF AG ended down 1.10 marks at 62.90 marks, Bayer AG ended down 1.18 marks at 66.90 marks, while Hoechst AG ended down two marks at 66.50 marks.</p>
<p>Other big losers were car stocks BMW AG, which closed down 40 marks at 1,390 marks, while Porsche ended down 129.90 marks at 2,060 marks.</p>
