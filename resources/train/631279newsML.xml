<p>Stock investors discouraged by Pakistan's shaky economic outlook are holding fire in the hope that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's reforms will bear fruit in the next fiscal year starting on July 1.</p>
<p>Euphoria generated at the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) by Sharif's triumph in February 3 polls has long since fizzled.</p>
<p>Hopes that his victory would usher in a new era of political stability with a pro-business prime minister at the helm have given way to gloom about a recalcitrant economic crisis.</p>
<p>With the 1997/98 budget (July-June) budget due to be announced on June 14, daily trading volume at the Karachi bourse has shrunk by more than 50 percent over the last couple of weeks and stock prices have tumbled as investors look the other way.</p>
<p>The Karachi 100-share index has shed more than 250 points since hitting a year-high of 1,775.57 points on February 20, but remains above its year-low of 1,341.31 on January 7.</p>
<p>&quot;Even after the sharp fall in the index over the last 10 weeks or so, it is still about 12 percent up on its year-low, which is a premium of political stability,&quot; said Mudassar Malik, chief dealer at brokerage house BMA Capital Management.</p>
<p>Analysts say battered stocks may revive in 1997/98 as the economy responds to Sharif's structural reforms aimed at stimulating export-led growth through tax and tariff cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;Stock prices are at low levels and offer a good investment opportunity,&quot; KSE president Arif Habib told Reuters.</p>
<p>Brokers see a small pre-budget rally later in June, but say gains can only be sustained if supported by budgetary measures.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors have already discounted weak fundamentals. They will now bet on hopes for the new year,&quot; said Ather Raouf, director of sales at Carr Mashriq.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz's budget, while likely to stress industrial revival, must also be angled towards the concerns of foreign donors and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>&quot;To lure investment, the government should get an IMF seal of approval for its economic policies. If not, it would be in a messy position,&quot; Malik said. &quot;The government should cut expenses and shelve unnecessary projects for fiscal 1997/98.&quot;</p>
<p>The IMF halted a standby loan in March after the government failed to meet agreed targets, including reducing the budget deficit to four percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>The fund has agreed to negotiate a medium-term loan from its enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) if Pakistan meets set targets and the 1997/98 budget proves satisfactory.</p>
<p>&quot;Investor interest is likely to revive once the budget is announced and the economic scene is clearer,&quot; dealer Shakil Anwar said.</p>
<p>Analysts say the economy may take 12 to 24 months to respond to Sharif's structural reforms and incentive packages, which will provide no short-term way out of a financial squeeze.</p>
<p>Foreign reserves, including gold, dropped to $1.502 billion on May 24 against $2.136 billion a year earlier, with $2.9 billion in debt payments due in the next six months. The trade gap soared to $2.894 billion in July-April from $2.827 billion in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>&quot;Declining forex reserves and the huge trade deficit remain main concerns for investors,&quot; Raouf said. &quot;Government revenues can also fall due to duty drawbacks and tariff cuts.&quot; He said political unrest and weak fundamentals dissuaded foreign and local investors from entering the market in 1995/96.</p>
<p>&quot;The present decline is the cumulative effect of the past. The government is trying to do whatever it can to boost the economy, but Sharif hasn't got a magic wand,&quot; Raouf added.</p>
<p>Former KSE president Yaseen Lakhani said Pakistani stocks had great growth potential compared with other regional markets.</p>
<p>&quot;In the coming few months, the government reforms will begin to make an impact on the economy and with IMF support there will definitely be a turnaround in the stock market,&quot; he said.</p>
