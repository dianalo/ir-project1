<p>Romania's exiled King Michael, his citizenship restored by a government hoping his prestige will boost its NATO membership bid, returned to his homeland on Friday to acclaim by thousands of fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Weary but beaming, Michael waved to up to 20,000 people shouting &quot;King Michael&quot; and &quot;King and Country&quot; in University Square, where dozens of demonstrators died in the December 1989 upheaval that toppled communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.</p>
<p>&quot;You were the one who freed me,&quot; cried a moustachioed pensioner, referring to the king's wartime arrest of military dictator Ion Antonescu and his switch of Romania's alliance from Nazi Germany to the Allies.</p>
<p>Michael's visit to Romania, his second since the fall of communism, is officially described as private, though his programme includes meetings with President Emil Constantinescu and Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea.</p>
<p>The king, forced to abdicate by communists in 1947, has promised to abide by Romania's 1991 republican constitution.</p>
<p>Constantinescu, who ousted ex-communist Ion Iliescu in elections last November, says the king's prestige could help boost Romania's outsider bid to join favourites Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic in the first wave of NATO expansion. Six NATO members, he argues, are constitutional monarchies.</p>
<p>Michael, 75, shook hands with hundreds of well-wishers and mounted first a pedestal of a monument to the 1989 dead, then the back of a car alongside his wife Ana of Bourbon Parma. But he abandoned an attempt to address the crowd with a megaphone.</p>
<p>People jammed against crowd barriers had old portraits of the king pinned to their lapels. University students hung out of fourth-floor windows overlooking the square.</p>
<p>The crowd later dispersed without incident.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show only a small fraction of Romanians favour restoration of the monarchy, though one of two small monarchist parties is within the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>Romanian state television broadcast most of Michael's engagements live and for the first time in the post-Communist era, showed film of his childhood.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome Your Majesty!&quot; read a headline splashed across screens before an evening documentary on the king.</p>
<p>As Michael emerged from the commercial aircraft that brought him to Bucharest from his exile home in Switzerland, tears streamed down his face.</p>
<p>He embraced his wife before being mobbed by several hundred supporters on the tarmac and picking his way through a profusion of television crews, government ministers and prominent cultural figures in the VIP lounge.</p>
<p>He thanked an unidentified official who handed him a new Romanian passport and waved before getting into a waiting car.</p>
<p>His motorocade paused at a shrine by the airport marking the spot where dozens of Romanian soldiers died in the upheaval which toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. It then proceeded to the Villa Elisabeta, a former royal residence where he signed his abdication at gunpoint 50 years ago.</p>
<p>The government described the restoration of Michael's citizenship a week ago as an &quot;act of reparation&quot;.</p>
<p>On his first return home in 1992, Michael drew hundreds of thousands into the streets at the Orthodox Easter. A subsequent visit was blocked by ex-president Iliescu, who treated him as a foreign commoner and made the granting of a visa contingent on his public acceptance of the constitution.</p>
<p>The ex-communists have denounced the visit as an attempt to distract Romanians from price rises for utilities and staples introduced this month. Nationalist parties have criticised it as leaving the door open for constitutional ambiguity.</p>
