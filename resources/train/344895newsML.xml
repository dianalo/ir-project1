<p>Belgian shares closed higher on Thursday, helped by gains on Wall Street, but dealers expected the index to consolidate in the coming week as investors were still uncertain about the Dow's strength.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still in a period of consolidation, today's rise was just a small reaction. Investors want more data before plunging into the market again,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Bel-20 index closed up 0.70 percent at 2,045.87, with a healthy 3 billion francs worth of volume of Belgian shares traded.</p>
<p>One trader said Belgian investors were also worried about the political developments in Belgium.</p>
<p>A widening bribery scandal involving the Francophone PS socialist party, one of four parties in Belgium's centre-left coalition government, has worried investors.</p>
<p>Dealers said investors were also nervously awaiting next week's meetings of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee and G7 finance ministers in Berlin.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are waiting for direction from the G7 and the FOMC meetings,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers said Belgian company reports, which are due to start coming out in the coming weeks, will give investors further guidance of where to invest.</p>
<p>Oil group PetroFina was the Bel-20's main gainer, up 3.04 percent, at 11,875 francs, after news of a 38 percent rise in 1996 profit.</p>
<p>&quot;People are at last realising PetroFina has good potential, and it will continue rising this year,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Cement maker CBR jumped 2.86 percent to 3,235 francs, recovering from recent profit-taking.</p>
<p>Elsewhere steel cord and wire maker Bekaert gained 1.17 percent to end at 19,400 francs.</p>
<p>&quot;Bekaert will stay around these levels as 1996 results will most likely show breakeven,&quot; another trader said.</p>
