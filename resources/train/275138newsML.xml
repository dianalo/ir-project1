<p>Palestinians and Jewish settlers in Hebron, long arch-antagonists, voiced opposition on Tuesday to a pending peace deal which would in effect partition the West Bank town between PLO and Israeli forces.</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of peace have they brought us? A city divided like East and West Berlin? Now we'll have North and South Hebron,&quot; Palestinian Hebronite Majdi al-Fakhouri told Reuters.</p>
<p>As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat held a summit on the Israel-Gaza border on Tuesday to clinch a long-elusive deal to hand over 80 percent of Hebron to PLO self-rule, Arabs and Jews braced for a new reality in the volatile town.</p>
<p>&quot;We're crossing our fingers that this agreement which God forbid will bring catastrophe on the oldest (Jewish) community in the world in Hebron won't be signed,&quot; settler Moshe Ben Zimra told Israel Radio. &quot;This terrible agreement will endanger our security.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli troops were due to withdraw last March from most of Hebron -- holy to Moslems and Jews and a hotbed of militancy for both -- under a 1995 peace deal.</p>
<p>But then-Israeli leader Shimon Peres delayed the pullback after a wave of Islamist suicide attacks killed scores in Israel 10 months ago. The handover was pushed off further when the hardline Netanyahu ousted Nobel laureate Peres in May.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has demanded the Hebron deal be modified to help protect Hebron's 400 Jewish settlers who live and study in heavily armed compounds amidst more than 100,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority has resolutely opposed any changes in the signed deal.</p>
<p>Israeli troops will continue to control 20 percent of Hebron -- and some 15,000 Palestinians -- after the redeployment.</p>
<p>&quot;What will be changed for me? I'll still live under Israeli occupation and settlers will have more harassment against me,&quot; coffeeshop owner Abdel Raouf al-Muhtaseb complained.</p>
<p>Hebron was mostly quiet on Tuesday as Arab and Jew awaited news from the U.S.-brokered talks. But the volatile city has been rumbling in recent days.</p>
<p>At least two Palestinians were taken to hospital on Saturday when Arabs and Israeli troops clashed after Jewish settlers scuffled with Palestinian school children in the town.</p>
<p>Israel imposed a curfew on central Hebron on Sunday after a number of molotov cocktails were thrown at Jewish homes there. The curfew was lifted Tuesday morning, the army said.</p>
<p>The city has seen much worse.</p>
<p>In February 1994, U.S.-born Baruch Goldstein from nearby Kiryat Arba settlement massacred 29 Palestinians kneeling in prayer at the burial place of the biblical Abraham before survivors beat him to death.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers fear the introduction of armed Palestinian police in Hebron will lead to a repeat of the 1929 slaughter of the city's Jewish community.</p>
<p>Hagai Ben-Artzi, a Hebron settler and brother-in-law of Netanyahu, held out hopes a &quot;miracle&quot; from God would stay the Israeli leader's hand from signing an accord.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of Israel has already lived for 4,000 years on miracles. It could very well be this miracle will occur,&quot; he told Israel radio.</p>
