<p>The Internet is unlikely to host a global futures or stock market any time soon because it is too unreliable, slow and insecure, Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) chief executive Les Hosking said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;To me the Internet is a carrier of information at this point in time, but it's not reliable enough to be an exchange system for the market, particularly for institutions, in terms of security, reliability, immediacy and counterparty elimination of risk,&quot; Hosking told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The SFE may look to use the Internet to extend the reach of its SYCOM computerised trading system, but this was at least five years away, Hosking said.</p>
<p>He said the Internet could be compared at the moment to a computurised flea market where individuals were trading non-standard products through electronic bulletin boards.</p>
<p>&quot;To move from the flea market to a highly organised, centralised, regulated marketplace where big and small are treated equally is a significant step,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>A global stock or futures market was more likely to be formed through an amalgamation or merger of the currently available private computerised trading systems.</p>
<p>&quot;It's more likely that the Globex type proprietary system will merge with other proprietary type systems to make them even more global,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hosking was speaking at the Australian Securities Commission's Electronic Commerce Conference.</p>
<p>Australian Stock Exchange Managing Director Richard Humphrey also told the conference that a global stock exchange via the Internet was five years or more away.  </p>
