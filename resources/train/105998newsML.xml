<p>British Gas Plc's pipeline arm TransCo warned on Wednesday against introducing the second phase of domestic gas competition in southern England next January.</p>
<p>Britain's gas industry regulator Ofgas published a proposal in September in which it advocated introducing phase two of domestic gas competition in two stages, the first to start on January 13.</p>
<p>But TransCo's response &quot;warns against starting in January 97 when severe mid-winter weather could be placing maximum demands on the gas distribution system.&quot;</p>
<p>Last April a pilot area covering the southwestern counties of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset and including 500,000 consumers was opened to competition. Householders there can now buy gas from any licensed supplier, and around 70,000 consumers have so far switched away from British Gas.</p>
<p>Ogfas has proposed opening the second pilot area, covering Dorset, the former county of Avon, East and West Sussex and Kent in two stages. Under its proposals, Dorset and the former Avon will be opened on January 13.</p>
<p>TransCo's managing director Harry Moulson said in a statement: &quot;Our recommendation has always been to start the next phase in April 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;There are risks associated with compressing the time available to January, and we believe these risks would be further compounded by starting in the winter when demands on the system will be great.&quot;</p>
<p>But the company said it strongly supported the need for phasing the next stage of competition, which will affect 1.5 million consumers. TransCo says phasing should allow no more than 50,000 supply point changes per day for the whole industry.</p>
<p>TransCo also said that in its response to Ofgas' September proposal it has &quot;pledged to continue to strive towards the successful introduction of competition in the U.K.'s domestic supply market.&quot;</p>
<p>Phase three of domestic competiton, covering all 19 million households in England, Scotland and Wales will be introduced in 1998.</p>
