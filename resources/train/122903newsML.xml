<headline>RUGBY UNION-ZONDAGH RESIGNS AS W.P. COACH.</headline>
<dateline>CAPE TOWN 1996-10-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Beleaguered Western Province rugby coach Alan Zondagh resigned from his position on Thursday, the Western Province Rugby Football Union (WPRFU) announced in a press statement.</p>
<p>Zondagh resigned halfway through a fresh two-year contract, citing a poor 1996 season and mounting pressures from the public and the media as his main reasons.</p>
<p>Under Zondagh's reign for three years, Western Province won the 1994 Lion Cup final and lost in the final of the 1995 Currie Cup to Natal.</p>
<p>But the province seemed to lose direction this season with a string of erratic performances and, having been the strength of South African domestic rugby a decade ago, they were not good enough this year to qualify for the Super 12 competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps he (Zondagh) lacked the ability to motivate his players, but this is where a captain capable of taking over the inspirational duties would have been the perfect combination. Unfortunately, no one was prepared to take on the role,&quot; WPRFU Ronni Masson president told a Cape Town newspaper on Thursday.</p>
<p>Assistant coach Gert Smal has been tipped as Zondagh's possible successor while former captain Tiaan Strauss, back from rugby league in Australia, could make a return to the side.</p>
