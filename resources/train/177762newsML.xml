<p>Gerry Adams, head of the IRA's political arm, accused Australia on Saturday of bowing to British pressure by refusing him an entry visa to promote his recently-published autobiography.</p>
<p>Australian Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock announced on Friday that Adams was being barred as a result of his &quot;intimate association&quot; with the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Adams, whose Sinn Fein party is excluded from multi-party talks in Belfast as long as the IRA is using armed force, said he was disappointed but not broken-hearted because of his current political workload.</p>
<p>&quot;I think at a political level, it is disappointing. On a personal level it is a bit of a relief at this time because things are so busy here at home,&quot; he told BBC radio.</p>
<p>Ruddock denied any British government intervention and said the visa refusal was based solely on Adams's failure to comply with the &quot;good character&quot; provisions of Australia's Migration Act.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein and the IRA want an end to British influence in Northern Ireland, where the majority Protestant population support continued London rule. It says it does not speak for, nor is it part of, the IRA.</p>
<p>British ministers say they believe the organisations are two sides of the one coin.</p>
<p>Adams suggested that Britain had lobbied against his entry to the United States before President Clinton gave him a visa in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the decision is the result of the type of lobbying which we saw in the American visa situation. In the Australian one, it appears that the government there succumbed to British pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Adams had hoped to visit Australia later this month to promote his book, &quot;Just Before Dawn&quot;.</p>
<p>The IRA relaunched hostilities in February after a 17-month ceasefire.</p>
