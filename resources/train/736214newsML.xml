<headline>FTC says 40 percent of milk packages &quot;short-filled&quot;.</headline>

<p>More than 40 percent of packages of milk and juice inspected by federal authorities contained less liquid than promised, the Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Over 40 percent of the groups of packages inspected contained less product than stated on their labels -- between 1 percent to 6 percent,&quot; said a report by the FTC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>&quot;The aggregate shortages can be significant over time,&quot; the FTC said.</p>
<p>Inspection were conducted by officials in 20 states. Inspectors visited 512 universities, hospitals, schools, retailers, dairies, and packaging plants. They made 1,638 inspections of milk, other dairy products and juice.</p>
<p>&quot;The prevalence of short-filling is troubling for everyone -- from consumers and school districts who quite reasonably expect to get what they pay for to competitors who haven't skimped,&quot; said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.</p>
<p>She said the FTC is now confident that packagers will use the report -- &quot;Milk: Does it Measure Up?&quot; -- to refine their packaging processes. She said additional inspections are planned.</p>
<p>Over 6 billion gallons of fluid milk were produced in 1996, with more than $8 billion in revenue to dairy produces.</p>
