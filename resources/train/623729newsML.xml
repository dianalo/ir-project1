<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice found on Thursday Belgium was late to enact directives on genetically modified organisms and the labelling of dangerous substances.</p>
<p>In two separate judgments, the court decided four cases submitted by the European Commission that demonstrated Belgium's lateness to enact local laws transposing EU directives.</p>
<p>The court did not accept Belgium's argument that national rules would be enacted soon, but stuck to their strict reading of time limits prescribed under the directives.</p>
