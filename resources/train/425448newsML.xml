<title>LEBANON: Lebanon lifts ban on Netanyahu book.</title>
<headline>Lebanon lifts ban on Netanyahu book.</headline>
<dateline>BEIRUT 1997-03-06</dateline>

<p>Lebanon's information minister on Thursday overruled a ban on distribution of materials published in Israel and authorised the sale of a book by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's book would help the Lebanese understand what Israel was up to, Information Minister Bassem al-Sabaa said.</p>
<p>&quot;The book contributes to improving the knowledge and awareness of Arab and Lebanese citizens towards the Zionist and Israeli plans and uncovers the thoughts that rule behavior of the enemy prime minister,&quot; Sabaa said in a statement published in Beirut newspapers.</p>
<p>Lebanon and Israel are officially at war despite six years of peace talks and an interior ministry ruling bars distribution of materials published in Israel.</p>
<p>Three Lebanese and an unidentified Jordanian were charged in November with infringing the ban by importing an Arabic version of Netanyahu's book &quot;A Place Among the Nations&quot;.</p>
<p>A prosecutor demanded up to 10 years jail for the men, who included a bookshop owner, a printing press owner and a shipping company owner. Judicial sources said on Thursday the charges would now be dropped.</p>
<p>English and Arabic versions of books written by Netanyahu's predecessor Shimon Peres are already available in Beirut bookshops.</p>
<p>Netanyahu came to power last May on a platform opposing Arab-Israeli peace talks on the basis of exchanging occupied Arab land for peace, which Peres and his predecessor Yitzhak Rabin had promoted.</p>
