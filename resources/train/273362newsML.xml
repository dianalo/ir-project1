<p>Parts of southern Spain may be declared a disaster zone after floods forced thousands to evacuate their homes, cut roads and damaged thousands of acres of crops, the Agriculture Minister said on Monday .</p>
<p>The rains eased by Monday but floods persisted after a week of heavy downpour in the Andalusia region burst river banks and inundated roads, fields and villages.</p>
<p>After surveying the worst hit regions by helicopter, Agriculture Minister Loyola de Palacio said the government would quickly evaluate the damage.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to see what types of measures are most appropriate, perhaps some type of extraordinary funding or another measure agreed with Andalusia's regional government,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;(Declaring a disaster zone) is one possibility depending on the evaluation made of the region,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>A search went on in Cadiz province for a man who disappeared when his car slid into the Guadalete river early on Sunday.</p>
<p>Although the south was worst hit, other parts of Spain also suffered the effects of high winds and heavy rain.</p>
<p>In the Canary Islands, the search continued for a Spanish man missing since Sunday who had been swimming off the coast of Gran Canaria in rough seas.</p>
<p>The Red Cross said they had recovered the body of a British man on Sunday who drowned while swimming off the same beach.</p>
<p>In southern Spain, local officials said around 2,200 people were forced out of their homes in the provinces of Cadiz and Seville, while more than 50 roads were closed due to flooding in the Andalusia region.</p>
<p>The rains also damaged crops in the south including olives, strawberries, potatoes and winter grains.</p>
<p>The Andalusian Farmers' Unions said the rains had caused around 75 billion pesetas ($573 million) of damage.</p>
