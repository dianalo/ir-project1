<p>Greece on Monday decried Turkish threats to settle a Cypriot ghost town as a &quot;violent provocation&quot; and appealed to international organisations and the United States to closely monitor developments.</p>
<p>A Turkish Cypriot ultra-nationalist leader has threatened to lead a protest rally into to fenced town of Varosha in the Turkish-held areas of the divided Mediterranean island and settled the resort town abandoned by Greek Cypriots in 1974.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greek government appeals to the United States, the members of the U.N. Security Council and the European Union to monitor any action that may take place and take specific measures,&quot; government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters.</p>
<p>Under a U.N.-brokered agreement, the town remains fenced off and uninhabited since Turkish troops occupied the north of the island in 1974 in response to a brief Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia that was backed by Athens.</p>
<p>The U.N. holds the Turkish government responsible for the maintenance of the status quo there.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not believe any of the authorities will stop us ...Anyone who likes any of the houses there should spray their name on it, that house will then be theirs,&quot; far-rightist Mehmet Arslan told followers over the weekend, ahead of a march to the town on March 2.</p>
<p>Greece angrily condemned his statements, saying they further hindered efforts to re-unite the island in a federation.</p>
<p>&quot;This king of statements are a violent provocation which undermine the climate we should all be trying to create in order to foster initiaves for the resolution of the Cyprus problem,&quot; Reppas said.</p>
<p>Tension between the island's Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities rose last month after the Cyprus government announced plans to buy anti-aircraft missiles from Russia and Turkish threats of military action to block their deployment.</p>
<p>Rauf Denktash, the head of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north, said two weeks ago that people would not be moved into Varosha on the eastern coast unless Greek Cypriots went ahead with their plans to buy the anti-aircraft missiles.</p>
<p>Denktash's breakaway state is recognised only by Turkey, which backs it with 30,000 Turkish troops.</p>
<p>A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said Ankara did not back the Turkish far-rightist plans to storm the Varosha on March 2.</p>
<p>&quot;A demonstration is one thing but factually, physically forcing the opening of Varosha is another thing,&quot; spokesman Omer Akbel told a news briefing.</p>
