<p>Prospects for a fall in Italian interest rates will depend to some extent on the outcome of France's general election, the chairman of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Marco Sarcinelli, said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;A lowering of rates is technically possible. However, account has to be taken not only of the economic outlook but also of national and international politics, above all with reference to elections in neighbouring countries,&quot; Sarcinelli told reporters.</p>
<p>France is due to hold parliamentary elections over two rounds on May 25 and June 1.</p>
<p>They have been called a year early by President Jacques Chirac to strengthen his hand in preparing France for membership of Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>Opinion polls give a clear lead to Prime Minister Alain Juppe's centre-right coalition over the opposition Socialists.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy cut its official discount rate to 6.75 percent on January 21, from a previous 7.50 percent.</p>
<p>Expectations of a further fall have been bolstered by low inflation trends following a year-on-year rise of 1.7 percent in the consumer price index in April, down from 2.2 percent in March.</p>
<p>Many economic analysts, however, say they believe central bank governor Antonio Fazio may want to await the outcome of the French elections and publication later this month of the Italian government's three-year economic targets for 1998-2000.</p>
