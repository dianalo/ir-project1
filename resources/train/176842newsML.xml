<title>TURKEY: Turkish murder trial of police transferred again.</title>

<p>The trial of police officers in connection with the killing of a Turkish journalist is to be transferred to the western town of Afyon because of security concerns, the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>The trial began in the southwestern town of Aydin last month under the critical eye of Turkey's Western allies and rights workers.</p>
<p>&quot;In the vicinity of the court where the case was heard, there are many schools and for this reason providing security would be difficult,&quot; the criminal court in Aydin was quoted as saying in a statement by Anatolian.</p>
<p>Forty-eight police officers were charged in connection with the killing in January of Metin Goktepe, who was alleged to have been  battered to death by police in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Goktepe was among scores of people rounded up at random for an identity check in Eyup sports complex after the funerals of two far-left militant prisoners.</p>
<p>The trial was previously transferred to Aydin from Istanbul, some 800 km (500 miles) away. Security was given as the reason.</p>
<p>Rights activists said then that the move was an attempt to keep the proceedings out of the public eye and ensure the trial was dragged out.</p>
<p>Nevertheless about 300 relatives, journalists and observers turned up at the first hearing.</p>
<p>Anatolian said the supreme court had ruled that the request from Aydin was acceptable and decided to transfer the case to Afyon, a province further northeast and several hours from the nearest airport.</p>
<p>A second hearing is scheduled to held on November 29. The 48 officers were not in court at the first hearing and were allowed to answer the accusations to other court officials without travelling to Aydin. They are not required to attend any of the hearings.</p>
