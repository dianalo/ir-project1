<headline>Canada bonds end stronger after rally on U.S. data.</headline>

<p>Canadian bonds closed stronger in active trading on Tuesday, matching sharp gains in U.S. Treasuries which rallied after the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data.</p>
<p>&quot;All the numbers were way weaker than expected. There were obviously a lot of shorts going into the numbers,&quot; said a bond trader with one Toronto-based, bank-owned brokerage. &quot;There were lots of buyers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark rose C$2.00 to C$109.25 to yield 7.208 percent. The U.S. 30-year bond rose 1-18/32 to yield 6.98 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the two bonds narrowed to 23 basis points from 26 basis points at the close of trading on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the fact that the Canadian bond market is less liquid than the U.S. market was probably the reason it outperformed when buyers flooded the market.</p>
<p>Both Canadian and U.S. fixed-income markets rallied on reports showing U.S. durable goods orders fell more than expected in March, while the U.S. employment cost index for the first quarter rose less than expected. The reports prompted speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be less eager to raise interest rates in the near future.</p>
