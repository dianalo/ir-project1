<p>A Peruvian government official assured German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in a telephone call on Wednesday that Peru would do everything in its power to peacefully resolve the hostage crisis in Lima.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry in Bonn said Peruvian state minister Voto Bernalez had assured Kinkel that Peru would be guided by the desire to protect the lives of the hostages.</p>
<p>Germany's ambassador to Peru is among at least 200 hostages held by heavily-armed guerrillas of the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement at the Japanese ambassador's residence.</p>
<p>Kinkel had appealed to Bernalez for prudence in Peru's efforts to free the hostages and requested that Peru refrain from any actions that could harm them.</p>
<p>&quot;Bernalez told Kinkel that the actions of the Peruvian government will be led by the same premise,&quot; a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>He told Kinkel that there were about 250 hostages being held by between 15 and 20 guerrillas. Bernalez also said Peru would consider Germany's offer to send a team of experts to help.</p>
<p>Earlier, Kinkel had told journalists: &quot;We expect and assume that Peru will do everything in its powers so that the lives of the hostages are not endangered.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am extremely concerned and call on the hostage-takers to let the people free,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>German Ambassador Heribert Woeckel was being held with around 15 other hostages in one room of the residence, Kinkel said.</p>
<p>Kinkel ordered Germany's ambassador to Bolivia to go to Lima and take over the running of the German embassy. A crisis specialist from Bonn was also on the way to Lima, Kinkel said.</p>
