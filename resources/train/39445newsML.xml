<p>Volkswagen management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech said in an interview on Sunday he intended to sharply boost the German carmaker's meagre return on sales.</p>
<p>Piech said in the interview with Der Spiegel magazine that VW, Europe's largest carmaker, would keep up its cost-cutting measures and seek more favourable contracts from suppliers.</p>
<p>Piech, 56, said he viewed Chrysler as a model for Volkswagen since the U.S. carmaker had produced a similar number of vehicles -- about two million -- during the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>He noted Chrysler had a return on sales of 6.6 percent compared to only 0.6 percent at VW during the 1996 first half.</p>
<p>Piech also said VW was &quot;about a quarter of the way&quot; on the road to reaching the goals he set out when he took over at the Wolfsburg-based carmaker in 1993.</p>
<p>When asked if VW could achieve its goal of a return on sales against pre-tax profits of at least 6.5 percent by 2000, Piech told the magazine, &quot;We have higher goals than just that. We want to become the most successful carmaker in Europe.&quot;</p>
