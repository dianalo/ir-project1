<title>CANADA: ELAN Energy falls on gloomy outlook.</title>

<p>Shares in Canadian heavy oil producer ELAN Energy Inc dropped to a new year low in busy trade on Friday after an analyst's report cast a gloomy outlook for the company's production, financial and stock market performance.</p>
<p>The report, released late on Thursday by First Energy Capital Corp analyst Martin Molyneaux, recommended investors sell the stock based on a deepening price discount for Canadian heavy oil, flagging production volumes, high operating costs and second-quarter cash flow well below last year's figure.  </p>
<p>Molyneaux also said that under his estimates ELAN was expected to report a second-quarter loss of C$0.07 a share.</p>
<p>ELAN, one of the Toronto Stock Exchange's most active issues on Friday, shed 1.20 to 8.05 with almost 3 million shares changing hands as investors rushed to unload the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;There is only one word to describe our estimates of ELAN's Q2 1997 results: ugly,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Molyneaux said he revised his 12-month target price for ELAN downward to 6.60.  </p>
<p>&quot;We would be exiting out of this stock at current levels,&quot; the report said. &quot;We continue to believe management has done a good job but has misjudged operating costs and the direction of heavy oil differentials.&quot;</p>
<p>The spread between Canadian light and heavy crudes has widened over the past two months to C$6.50-C$7 per barrel, about double last year's levels.</p>
<p>ELAN Chief Executive Verne Johnson told Reuters last month the company was producing about 34,000 barrels a day, well below expectations, after poor operating weather early in the second quarter delayed drilling and production operations.  </p>
<p>Molyneaux's report said the production level -- equal to that of the first quarter of 1996 -- had not changed from early June.</p>
<p>ELAN, whose main operating areas include Cactus Lake in west central Saskatchewan and Lindburgh and Cold Lake in Alberta, has had a flagging stock price since late last year when it failed to meet its oil production targets.</p>
<p>Its year high of 14 was reached in October.</p>
<p>As shown with Renaissance Energy Ltd on Thursday, investors displayed little tolerance for output levels coming in below expectations.</p>
<p>Renaissance had a major selloff in its stock after it revealed its oil production forecast was revised downward.</p>
<p>Molyneaux said he estimated ELAN's 1997 free, fully diluted cash flow per share at C$1.23, which would be a drop from C$2.33 in 1996.</p>
<p>He pegged the company's operating costs at a &quot;relatively high&quot; C$8.20 a barrel.</p>
