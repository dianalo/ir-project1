<p>Hong Kong stocks ended flat on Thursday, unable to retain the momentum of an early rally as property issues remained depressed and concerns about interest rates continued to dampen sentiment.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index rose 2.97 points, or 0.02 percent, to 13,288.40 after touching an early high of 13,405.54. Turnover was HK$10.01 billion compared with Wednesday's HK$11.89 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a quite disappointing performance,&quot; said Alex Wong, technical analyst at Dharmala Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the property stocks are still under pressure. It is likely that the market will continue to consolidate.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said investors were still worried about the possibility of a U.S. interest rate rise at the Federal Reserve's policy setting meeting next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless we see signs that the Fed is unlikely to raise rates in the short term, people will still be cautious and the market will continue to consolidate,&quot; said Wong.</p>
<p>Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International, said the market seemed to have found support at 13,200 points and could try to test higher ground in the coming sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;The short term trading range is still between 13,000 and 14,000 probably for the next three to four weeks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said once the banks start to report earnings, the Hang Seng could try to test 14,000 points again. &quot;But for the time being it looks like we are trying to test 13,500,&quot; Tang added.</p>
<p>In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings gained HK$2.00 to HK$177.50 and Bank of East Asia rose HK$0.50 to HK$35.80.</p>
<p>&quot;Banking shares are likely to lead the rally the next time round. 1996 was a good year for banking,&quot; said Wong.</p>
<p>Bank of East Asia is due to release final results on Monday.</p>
<p>Property stocks continued to suffer from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's recommendation this week that banks cap mortgage lending for luxury properties.</p>
<p>Henderson Land fell HK$0.25 to HK$72.25, Sun Hung Kai Properties shed HK$0.50 to HK$88.25 and Swire Pacific dropped HK$1.00 to HK$71.75.</p>
<p>China Light continued to rise following news CITIC would buy a stake in the utility. The stock gained HK$1.00 to HK$35.80.</p>
<p>GZI Transport Ltd, an infrastructure spinoff of Guangzhou Investment Co Ltd, made its trading debut on Thursday and closed at HK$4.875 compared with an issue price of HK$3.23.</p>
<p>January Hang Seng futures, which expired on Thursday, rose 71 points to 13,296.</p>
