<p>Police from the Tanah Abang district confirmed the incident involved a gang dispute but were unable immediately to give any details.</p>
<p>News of the dispute spread quickly through Jakarta's financial markets, which have reacted to recent riots and demonstrations in Indondsia.</p>
<p>Shop owners in Tanah Abang quickly closed their stores as a precaution after the early morning confrontation between the two gangs.</p>

<p>Tanah Abang, an important area for the textile trade in Jakarta and home to a number of local banks, is also known for its cheap accommodation and its red-light district.</p>
