<p>The public share offer in leading tourism concern Serena Lodges &amp; Hotels has been undermined by scepticism over Kenya's future as a preferred tourist destination, brokers and market analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's slow. It's not happening,&quot; a leading broker told Reuters on Friday, speculating that perhaps a rush for the shares next week would turn the market sentiment.</p>
<p>Some 9,025,100 shares held by government tourism agency Kenya Tourism Development Corporation are on offer for sale at a discounted price of 13 shillings per share. The offering opened on March 24 and will close on April 14.</p>
<p>Serena has projected increased turnover to 1.27 billion shillings ($2.3 million) and a profit of 66.3 million after tax for the year ending 31 December 1997, versus a turnover of $1.16 billion and after-tax profit of 41.2 million shillings in 1996.</p>
<p>The figures are issued in the share offer prospectus. Serena says they are based on the assumption there will be no change in tourist flows to Kenya and no violent swings in foreign exchange and interest rates as well as inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;People might avoid the share because of the potential volatility of the tourism industry,&quot; said Rick Ashley, managing director of local brokerage house Town and Country Securities.</p>
<p>Ashley added that it was still too early to pass judgment.</p>
<p>Market analysts said a volatile earnings history and a set of variables beyond the hotel's control could also affect the future performance of the group and therefore the share offer.</p>
<p>&quot;Their earnings depend on movement of the exchange rate and the number of tourists that flow into the country,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya's economic review for March showed a drop of seven percent in tourism earnings to $447 million in the year to January 1997 from $482 million the previous year.</p>
<p>Market analysts argued that the share could provide a dollar hedge particularly if investors were of the opinion that the Kenyan shilling was currently overvalued.</p>
<p>&quot;Serena's bills are pegged to the dollar which gives Kenyan investors interested in dollar exposure a chance,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Some brokers still spoke of oversubscription, based on the Kenyan public's familiarity with the hotel group.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an awful lot of interest particularly from the retail investor,&quot; a senior broker said.</p>
<p>The issue is open to foreigners, subject to rules that restrict such investment to 40 percent in a company and five percent for each individual in one company. ($1=54.7 Kenyan Shillings)</p>
