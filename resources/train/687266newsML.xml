<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came to San Francisco to speak about Asia on Tuesday -- but Cuba intruded.</p>
<p>Three times as she was delivering an address to the Commonwealth Club, Albright was interrupted as protesters -- two groups of two, followed by one woman -- stood and loudly criticised the U.S. embargo of the communist ruled island.</p>
<p>And three times a clearly displeased Albright stopped her speech and delivered a reply that drew applause from the prestigious foreign affairs group as the protesters were hustled out of the San Francisco Hilton Hotel by security guards and police.</p>
<p>&quot;End the U.S. blockade of Cuba,&quot; the first pair shouted, displaying a banner.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we can talk about that later,&quot; Albright said.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop the U.S. blockade of Cuba,&quot; the second group demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Next time I'll give a speech on Cuba,&quot; Albright told them.</p>
<p>The third protester was more severe. &quot;We are opposed to Albright's genocidal policies,&quot; she said. At this point, some people in the audience hissed.</p>
<p>Albright quipped, &quot;Now I know why you have so many people at lunch,&quot; then spoke seriously about her conviction that &quot;there is nothing romantic about (Fidel) Castro...(who rules) his people in a very dictatorial and totalitarian way (and has been) very vindictive toward the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to have good and friendly relations with Cuba but it's Cuba that has to change its behaviour, not the United States,&quot; she added.</p>
