<title>CANADA: Canadian T-bills open weaker on rate hike concern.</title>
<headline>Canadian T-bills open weaker on rate hike concern.</headline>

<p>Canadian T-bills opened weaker for a second straight session on Friday as concern about a near-term Bank of Canada rate hike sent yields higher, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the market is projecting an impending rate hike by the bank. I think they're pricing it in. There really isn't anything more than that,&quot; said Walter Posiewko, a money market trader with Royal Bank Investment Management.</p>
<p>Canada's three-month cash T-bill softened to yield 3.33 percent from 3.32 percent at the close of trading on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Analysts said recent signs of strength in the economy, combined some weakness in the currency, have spurred speculation of a near-term Bank of Canada rate hike. Last month the Bank of Canada hiked interest rates by 25 basis points, its first such move in more than two years.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like its talking itself into believing there's some kind of an impending rate hike, and they're just adjusting rates to reflect that,&quot; said Posiewko.  </p>
<p>Activity in the Canadian money market during the past week has been muted ahead of 0900 EDT/1300 GMT, when the Bank of Canada traditional announces rate hikes.</p>
<p>Posiewko said he thought talk of a rate hike was overdone and while there has been some currency weakness and a move up in the consumer prices index, it is not enough to send rates higher. The Canadian consumer price index report for June out on Thursday showed the so-called core CPI rose 0.2 percent on the month and 2.0 percent on the year.</p>
<p>In other prices, the six-month when-issued T-bill weakened to yield 3.70 percent from a 3.69 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>The one-year T-bill traded unchanged to yield 4.18 percent.</p>
<p>The call loan or overnight lending rate traded at 3.25 percent, in the middle of the Bank of Canada's 3.0-3.5 percent target range.</p>
