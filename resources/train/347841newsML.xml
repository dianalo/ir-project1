<p>This is how major world bond markets were trading in late European business on Friday.</p>

<p>EUROBONDS - Following a very active start to the year, primary market supply simmered down with expectations of a subdued start to February amid cautiousness ahead of next week's U.S. FOMC meeting.The highlight of the day was the launch of the EIB's 1.0 billion Ecu-into-Euro April 2004 bond which performed well.
