<p>Most Argentine blue chip gains melted away on profit-taking at the close Wednesday despite an unrelenting surge in benchmark stock YPF, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market hit technical targets which triggered sell programs, causing volume to swell dramatically and gains to fade away,&quot; said Jorge Bonanno at Interfin brokers. &quot;Prices are now at reasonable levels and Thursday's performance will depend largely on U.S. economic indicators.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index  .MERV slipped off a high of 671.6 to close at 664.58 with a 0.2 percent gain.  </p>
<p>Floor volume soared to a hefty 37.5 million pesos from Tuesday's weak tally of 16.9 million, while over-the-counter turnover swelled to 202.3 million from Tuesday's 93.4 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very busy here today and YPF was the star again after Tuesday's (2.4 percent) leap,&quot; said another trader. &quot;The stock has now made up for lost territory compared to other blue chips and should stay more or less rangebound.&quot;</p>
<p>The oil giant's share shot up 3.9 percent to $26.75, its highest price since February 1994. Traders attributed the surge chiefly to a shift in international investment flows towards commodity stocks over the past two weeks.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's nothing special, just the right conditions for a key stock which was lagging the rest,&quot; Bonanno said.</p>
<p>The broad market rose 1.4 percent in the session, with 42 winners, half as many losers and 22 stocks closing flat.</p>
<p>Top main-tier performers included oil company Sol Petroleo and Telefonica, up 3.8 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The biggest losers were foods giant Molinos and construction stock Polledo, off 3.7 percent and 3.6 percent. Steelmaker Acindar shed 1.3 percent even though Santander initiated it Tuesday with a buy recommendation.</p>
