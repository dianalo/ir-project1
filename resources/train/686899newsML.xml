<title>USA: Ross Technology sees significant Q1 loss.</title>

<p>Ross Technology Inc said Wednesday that it expects the first quarter of fiscal 1998 to produce a &quot;significant&quot; loss, based on the results of the quarter to date.</p>
<p>Ross technology reported a net loss of $86.7 million, or $3.71 per share, on revenue of $83.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>This compares to net income of $18.2 million, or $0.83 per share, on revenue of $100.8 million for the 1996 fiscal year.  </p>
<p>Ross said that based on the commitment from its majority shareholder, Fujitsu Ltd, and the company's current operating plan, it believes that its cash requirements will be met during the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Beyond that time, the company may require additional equity or debt financing.  </p>
<p>Ross said it expects continuation for the forseeable future of lower-than-expected demand for a number of its products, especially its lower-speed microprocessor chips and associated semiconductors and MBus modules, as well as routine price degradation on older products.</p>
<p>The company said it anticipates that gross profit will continue to remain under pressure for the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including lower margins for system products, continued industry-wide pricing pressures, increased competition, and compressed product life cycles.  </p>
<p>Ross said it expects its selling, general and administrative expense to decrease from fiscal 1997 levels in both dollar terms and as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to the unusual amount of delinquent accounts receivable written off in fiscal 1997, partially offset by an increase in sales-related employees.</p>
<p>According to Ross, its inability to effectively monitor credit and collections resulted in a charge of $16.5 million for accounts receivable write-offs in 1997.  </p>
<p>The company expects interest expenses to be substantially higher on a quarterly basis during fiscal 1998 as a result of increased borrowing requirements.</p>
<p>Ross said that the reduction in sales in 1997 was primarily attributable to a reduction in orders from the company's primary customer and to changes in executive and sales personnel, which diminished its ability to both sell its products and monitor credit and collections.</p>
<p>In 1997, the company recorded a $44.1 million charge against cost of goods sold relating to a reduction in the value of its microprocessor-related and other inventory, primarily due to obsolescence.</p>
<p>As a result of the losses and the deterioration of the company's financial condition and liquidity, remaining goodwill of about $2.5 million was written off and a valuation reserve of about $27.9 million was established against the company's deferred tax asset.</p>
