<p>Michael Doohan, poised to clinch his fourth successive 500cc motorcycling world title, claimed pole position for the Brazilian Grand Prix on Saturday after lapping inside his circuit record in practice.</p>
<p>The Australian Honda rider, who had clocked a new circuit best time of one minute 52.552 seconds on Friday, went faster again at the Jacarepagua track in the final session.</p>
<p>Doohan, the unrivalled winner of the last six races, demolished the 1.52 barrier on his last lap with a time of one minute 51.955 seconds.</p>
<p>Italy's Luca Cadalora, riding a Yamaha, took second place with 1:52.353, after nipping ahead of Carlos Checa near the end of qualifying. The Spaniard, who finished third in 1:52.464, had been second behind Doohan for most of the session.</p>
<p>Doohan, who last year criticised the Jacarepagua track as being too bumpy, said he was happy with a new surface which has been laid although the racing line was still very narrow.</p>
<p>&quot;We only have a groove two metres wide so passing is going to be difficult,&quot; he said, adding that improvements had been made too late.</p>
<p>&quot;The racetrack is a great racetrack but everyone is disappointed that for the third year running it is not exactly how we wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At least this year I can keep the bike on the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Cadalora agreed: &quot;There is only a narrow line that you can keep your grip on. The changes were made too late.&quot;</p>
<p>Doohan, whose fourth title seems a formality after injury removed his main rival and team mate Alex Criville of Spain earlier in the season, can wrap up the championship if he wins and the other results go in his favour.</p>
<p>The Australian needs second-placed Nobuatsu Aoki of Japan, seventh on the grid, to finish ninth or below and third-placed Tadayuki Okada, fourth on the grid, to finish fifth or below. None of the other riders can catch Doohan.</p>
<p>Japan's Takuma Aoki, who injured a shoulder blade after falling on Friday, did not ride in Saturday's practice and failed to qualify.</p>
