<p>Former Australian prime minister Paul Keating said on Monday the race debate which has engulfed the nation was dangerously divisive and an issue best solved by the country becoming a republic.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the pity is that at this mature stage of our national life we are still arguing about the most basic issues of our identity,&quot; Keating said in a speech to the University of New South Wales.</p>
<p>&quot;That is one of the many reasons why I am utterly convinced that we should be a republic,&quot; said Keating, who as prime minister wanted Australia to become a republic by 2001.</p>
<p>Keating said the race debate, sparked by independent politican Pauline Hanson in September when she said Australia was being swamped by Asians, was &quot;dangerously divisive&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the race debate reflected concerns in Australia about the end of full-employment and insecurity about the future.</p>
<p>Australia could resolve its national identity if its government and national symbols better reflected its independent, multi-cultural society, Keating said.</p>
<p>Britain's Queen Elizabeth, who is head-of-state of Australia and 15 other United Nations countries, could no longer represent such a culturally diverse country as Australia, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is much more than shallow symbolism,&quot; Keating said.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who still argue that our continuing links with the British monarchy do not handicap our international efforts...simply do not understand the stakes we are playing for,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;An Australian head-of-state can embody and represent our values and traditions, our experience and contemporary aspirations, our cultural diversity and social complexity in a way that a British monarch...can no longer adequately hope to do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Keating said Hanson's attacks on Asians and Aborigines were &quot;one of the saddest developments&quot; in recent Australian history.</p>
<p>&quot;The great tragedy of the shamelessly regressive politics of Pauline Hanson is not so much that it is rooted in ignorance, prejudice and fear...that it projects the ugly face of racism...the great tragedy is that it perpetrates a myth, a fantasy, a lie,&quot; he said. &quot;The myth of monoculture.&quot;</p>
<p>Asians make up about 4.7 percent of Australia's 18 million population and one third of the 100,000 immigrants each year.</p>
<p>&quot;Australia's post-war immigration policy was one of the greatest strategic decisions this country has made,&quot; Keating said, referring to the end of the discriminatory White Australia immigration policy.</p>
<p>&quot;It transformed our country and strengthened our economy. It has made Australia a culturally richer, more varied and much more interesting place to live,&quot; Keating said.</p>
