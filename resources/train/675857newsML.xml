<p>More than two years into the recovery from Mexico's December 1994 peso crash, the main concerns of business leaders in Mexico are economic and political instability, recent studies show.</p>
<p>According to a survey of 405 members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico, key factors inhibiting investment in Mexico, were &quot;economic instability and uncertainty&quot; and &quot;political and social instability and uncertainty.&quot;  </p>
<p>They said Mexico remained an attractive business option because of its links with the United States both geographically and via the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The &quot;size and potential of the marketplace&quot; and the &quot;low cost of labor&quot; were considered Mexico's principal benefits.</p>
<p>The AmCham's 40-page report had been scheduled to be released just before President Bill Clinton's visit to Mexico in early May, but it was delayed, some suspected, because the timing was considered too sensitive.  </p>
<p>It comes out in the run-up to key congressional, gubernatorial and Mexico City mayoral elections on July 6, that are expected to threaten the decades-old dominion of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).</p>
<p>Foreign investors are closely watching the elections, fearing economic reforms could be blocked if the PRI loses its 68-year majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The latest opinion polls predict the PRI will beat out the competition, but it is not fully clear that it will keep its majority.  </p>
<p>Such political uncertainties, a steep tax burden and government red tape have spurred many companies to move their business elsewhere, the study said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Mexico cannot win all of the projects for which it is considered, it has already lost important amounts of investment to other countries which either presented more favorable conditions or incentives than Mexico,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Almost 20 percent of firms said that from 1993 to 1996 they decided to take investment projects that could have gone to Mexico to other countries.  </p>
<p>&quot;From the group of firms surveyed, $3.04 billion of investment projects were lost to other countries,&quot; the report said. This compares to a total investment in Mexico of $11.7 billion in Mexico by the AmCham firms.</p>
<p>Mexico was passed over in favor of investments in the United States, Brazil, China, Argentina and Venezuela.</p>
<p>The study provided suggestions for keeping investment in Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;Fiscal incentives will stimulate a more competitive and attractive business environment,&quot; the study concluded.  </p>
<p>&quot;(Bureaucracy) is an oft-heard complaint in Mexico, but one which the public sector has often referred to as too overwhelming to address,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Some of the report's conclusions were backed up by other studies released recently. The Miami-based Strategic Research Corp ranked Mexico the Latin American country with the third highest political risk, after Venezuela and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Jay Pelosky, strategist at investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter wrote in a report on Friday that, &quot;The biggest risks, in our view, are urban violence, or fraudulent elections, neither of which we expect.&quot;</p>
