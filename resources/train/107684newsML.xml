<p>A retired teacher showed a court on Thursday pieces of skin torn from his body after he was flayed at torture sessions under Ethiopia's former Marxist regime.</p>
<p>&quot;I was blindfolded and a ball was thrust into my mouth. My hands were tied behind my back and my two legs were chained,&quot; Armasu Maru,aged 60, said of the torture sessions in prison between 1976 and 1981.</p>
<p>&quot;I was then turned upside down and thrust between two vices which held my body tilted. I was beaten with a wooden plank with many nails protruding which literally transformed my body into a river of blood, not one time but five times,&quot; Armasu added.</p>
<p>He was testifying as a prosecution witness at the trial of 71 members of the Dergue, the Marxist military junta which overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and ruled until 1991.</p>
<p>A total of 46 of the former officials of the Dergue are in the dock in Addis Ababa. Twenty-five others, including former Marxist ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam, are on trial in absentia.</p>
<p>The 71 on trial are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity and face being sentenced to death if found guilty.</p>
<p>Armasu said he was tortured because he was suspected of being a member of the rebel Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). He presented a parcel containing pieces of flayed skin to the court as the 46 defendants looked on grimly in silence.</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Desalenge Alemu Kibret inspected the parcel before returning it to the witness.</p>
<p>Armasu said after each torture session in a special prison at Dergue headquarters in Addis Ababa he was carried on a stretcher to a small cell full of prisoners who dressed his wounds and revived him.</p>
<p>Armasu said he vividly remembered a room called &quot;The Stalin Stick&quot; where opponents of the regime were beaten and killed.</p>
<p>He said prisoners at the Dergue prison were fed &quot;stinking left-over food even unfit for dogs to eat&quot; and unlike other prisoners were not allowed to receive food from their families.</p>
<p>He said prisoners were denied water so drank their own urine.</p>
<p>Armasu said he was held in the prison several times between 1976 and 1981 and was released on the orders of Colonel Debella Dinsa, one of the defendants.</p>
<p>Adane Retta, 86, told the court three of his children, one of his brothers and a cousin were killed by the Marxist junta because they were suspected of being members of an opposition group.</p>
<p>The government says it holds 1,700 prisoners for alleged crimes under the Dergue. The only ones charged are those now on trial and the 46 present in court have all pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>The rest of the prisoners have been held for up to five years without charge. The Dergue trial, which only resumed on October 1 after a two-month break, was adjourned to Tuesday.</p>
