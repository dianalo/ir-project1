<p>What is seen as the start of a top management reshuffle within Hong Kong's airlines linked to its handover to China took place Monday with Stanley Hui taking up his new position as head of Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair), industry sources said.</p>
<p>A Dragonair spokeswoman told Reuters, that Hui who was previously chief operating officer at Air Hong Kong started work at Dragonair on Monday. He replaces Philip Chen who will become deputy managing director of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd from March 1.</p>
<p>Industry observers said Hui's arrival as the new chief executive officer signals the start of a top management reshuffle within the territory's airlines - de facto flag carrier Cathay, regional carrier Dragonair and cargo carrier AHK Air Hong Kong Limited.</p>
<p>The observers predict Philip Chen is being groomed to become Cathay's first local chief executive after Hong Kong is handed back to China later this year.</p>
<p>Air Hong Kong is 75 per cent owned by Cathay, part of the Swire Group conglomerate which also has a 17.7 percent stake in Dragonair. Hui is being replaced at Air Hong Kong by Kenny Tang who has also had extensive management experience within Swire.</p>
<p>Industry observers said the changes are part of the &quot;Chinese-ification&quot; of the airlines in the aftermath of last year's deal which saw Swires stake in Cathay diluted and mainland company Citic Pacific increase its share in Dragonair.</p>
