<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa investigators uncover secret police files.</title>

<p>South African Police Minister Sydney Mufamadi said on Thursday investigators had found that large numbers of security branch files were destroyed before the African National Congress (ANC) took power in 1994.</p>
<p>But investigators did uncover a small number of apartheid security police files which were not shredded, as well as some documents indicating which files had been destroyed, the minister said. The files covered the period 1960 to 1994.</p>
<p>Mufamadi said he had met the investigators on Thursday and after consultation had decided not to reveal the contents of the documents which had been unearthed in order not to prejudice further investigations. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>The investigators were overseen by the police ministry, the statutory Truth and Reconciliation Commission probing human rights abuses committed under apartheid, Human Rights Commission and the National Archives.</p>
<p>A junior policeman told the truth probe in October last year that police in one small town had shredded a pile of files &quot;as big as a table&quot;. Widespread rumours have abounded that policemen across the country did the same to cover up their actions.</p>
<p>President Nelson Mandela's ANC swept into power after all-race elections in April 1994 which relegated the former ruling National Party to the opposition ranks after four decades of minority white governance.</p>
