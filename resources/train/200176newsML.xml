<headline>Court of Justice rules against Siemens in shareholder case.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1996-11-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice ruled against German electronics company Siemens AG on Tuesday in a case involving a shareholder's challenge to a resolution adopted at a company general meeting.</p>
<p>The resolution authorised the management board to increase capital by issuing ordinary shares in return for consideration in cash or in kind.</p>
<p>Germany's Federal Court of Justice ruled that the general meeting violated German law by withdrawing the shareholders' &quot;right of pre-emption&quot; -- that is, their right to request to be allocated some of the new shares in proportion to the capital represented by their shares.</p>
<p>It said the right could be withdrawn only if it was justified on objective grounds, with the respective interests of the company and the shareholders considered.</p>
<p>It asked the EU court to decide whether German law complied with the Second Council Directive 77/91/EEC on coordination of safeguards in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital.</p>
<p>Siemens argued that the Second Directive prescribed a right of pre-emption only for increases in capital by consideration in cash. But the court said that by refraining from laying down rules, the directive left member states &quot;at liberty to provide or not to provide for a right of pre-emption&quot; for increases in capital by consideration in kind.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&quot;Company law - Increase in capital - Consideration in kind - Shareholders' right of pre-emption - Withdrawal)</p>
<p>In Case C-42/95,</p>
<p>Reference to the Court under Article 177 of the EC Treaty by the Bundesgerichtshof for a preliminary ruling in the proceedings pending before that court between Siemens AG and Henry Hold on the interpretation of the Second Council Directive (77/91/EEC) of 13 December 1976 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent (OJ 1977 L 26, p. 1), in particular Article 29 (1) and (4) thereof,</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The COURT hereby rules</p>
<p>The Second Council Directive (77/91/EEC) of 13 December 1976 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent, in particular Article 29(1) and (4) thereof, does not preclude a Member State's domestic law from granting a right of pre-emption to shareholders in the event of an increase in capital by consideration in kind and from subjecting the legality of a decision withdrawing that right of pre-emption to a substantive review of the kind laid down by the Bundesgerichtshof.</p>
