<p>Peru's highest military court has rejected an appeal from Lori Berenson, an American woman jailed for allegedly being a Tupac Amaru guerrilla, to have her life sentence reduced, judicial sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;With this decision, the case is closed and unfortunately all that is left now is for her to serve her life sentence,&quot; a spokesman for the Supreme Military Justice Council said.</p>
<p>The five-member council made its decision on Berenson's appeal in early April but delayed announcing it until after troops stormed the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima where the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) held 72 captives for 126 days.</p>
<p>&quot;The crime is proved, the evidence is sufficient, and the court has declared null her appeal for a sentence reduction,&quot; the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Berenson was sentenced in January 1996 by a &quot;faceless&quot; military court for allegedly helping plot a takeover of Peru's Congress by the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru group. She is serving her sentence at the notoriously cold and grim Yanamayo maximum-security prison in the 13,000-foot-high (4,000 metres) Andean city of Puno.</p>
<p>The Tupac Amaru hostage-takers included Berenson in a list of prisoners whose release was their principal demand after the Dec. 17 takeover of the Japanese compound. All 14 rebels, two soldiers and one of the hostages died when Peru's military stormed the building on April 22.</p>
<p>Since her conviction on charges of treason, there has been a growing campaign in the United States, actively supported by former President Jimmy Carter, to annul the sentence of the secret court, where judges and lawyers wore hoods and cross- examination was not allowed.</p>
<p>Berenson's parents, who say their daughter is suffering severely from the altitude and poor food and conditions at Yanamayo, insist that she is innocent and are demanding a retrial in a civil court.</p>
