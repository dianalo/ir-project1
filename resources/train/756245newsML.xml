<p>Britain's economy grew an annual 3.4 percent in the second quarter of 1997, official figures showed on Friday, well above what most economists view as a sustainable rate.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported economic growth of 0.9 percent in the second quarter over the first, a rate which underlines the strength of the economy and will increase pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates again soon.</p>
<p>&quot;It is well above trend growth and keeps the alert on for higher interest rates,&quot; said Peter Luxton, economist at MMS International.</p>
<p>Most economists say the &quot;trend rate&quot; of growth,  which an economy can sustain without fuelling inflation, is no more than 2.5 percent. The British economy has been rattling along faster than that for some time. In the first quarter, GDP grew an annual 3.1 percent.</p>
<p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, now free to set interest rates in order to keep inflation under control, meets next on August 6 and 7.</p>
<p>After three quarter-point increases in as many months, taking base rates to 6.75 percent, Britain's beleaguered manufacturers were praying they do not tighten again soon. But their pleas might fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>The pound was unmoved by the GDP figures, holding steady at 3.05 marks. But that still represented a gain of more than 30 percent against the German currency since last August. Earlier this week, it surged to an eight-year high against the mark.</p>
<p>The GDP data showed Britain's economic recovery remains very much a twin-track one.</p>
<p>The booming service sector again led the way, chalking up growth of 4.5 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of June. In stark contrast, the ONS said manufacturing output was only &quot;broadly flat&quot; over the latest three months.</p>
<p>The soaring pound is the main bugbear of Britain's manufacturers, and exporters in particular. The higher it climbs, the more expensive exports become abroad.</p>
<p>The pound's strength also cuts the price of imported goods, making it harder for British producers to compete in the buoyant domestic market.</p>
<p>&quot;The robust overall growth figure conceals a growing imbalance between the manufacturing and service sectors,&quot; said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>That split heightens the policy dilemma facing the Bank of England but Loynes said the impact on high street spending of some 35 billion pounds in windfall payments from building societies converting into banks, would figure heavily in the Bank's thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;Further rises in interest rates over the coming months look certain,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In testimony to Parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Eddie George said the billions of pounds of free shares from building societies would have an effect on inflation and the Bank was desperately trying to quantify the impact.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica, said the Bank would be particularly concerned about service sector growth of 4.5 percent. &quot;That is where the real threat to inflation lies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He expected the Bank's monetary policy committee to hold fire in August but tighten again in September.</p>
<p>But others said the odds were heavily on a rate rise next month. &quot;These figures by themselves won't prompt a rate hike but certainly I think there is a strong possibility they could move as early as August,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International.</p>
