<p>A late rally led by pivotal stocks helped Bombay bourses finish near the day's highest levels on Tuesday, with the benchmark Bombay index closing above the 3,500 mark, dealers said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange jumped 60.08 points, or 1.74 percent, to end at a provisional 3,503.63--the intra-day high.</p>
<p>Participants said speculation the federal budget due on February 28 will contain market friendly measures prompted buying.</p>
<p>&quot;With growing expectations about the budget, more players are entering the market,&quot; said chief dealer Ketan Jhaveri at brokerage Kotak Securities.</p>
<p>Some funds were keen buyers in cement stocks in anticipation of incentives likely to be given to the industry, traders said.</p>
<p>Cement maker ACC rose 80.75 rupees, or 5.83 percent, to 1,465.0 in volumes of 121,531. Gujarat Ambuja Cement which last week announced a 20 percent rise in net profit for the first half ending December 1996 jumped 9.25 rupees, or 3.79 percent, to 253.25 with 431,659 shares traded.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has shown a steady rise today. It is more due to operators building up positions ahead of the budget,&quot; said Ravi Chadha, institutional dealer at brokers Motilal Oswal.</p>
<p>Kotak's Jhaveri said, &quot;The nominal arbitrage opportunities between Bombay bourses indicates that operators are taking delivery based positions.&quot;</p>
<p>In the list of pivotal stocks, SBI gained 11.50 rupees to 282.75, TELCO 13.20 to 333.0, L&amp;T 6.75 to 247.25, ITC 7.75 to 408.75 and Reliance 4.50 to 278.0.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a pre-budget euphoria that we are seeing. A short-term rally is likely to prompt fence-sitters to build up fresh positions,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign funds however, are not aggressive buyers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 50-stock National Stock Exchange index ended 12.60 points higher at 994.05, off the day's highest level of 996.05.</p>
