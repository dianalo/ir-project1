<p>Australian wool prices, which rose this week to their highest levels in 18 months, are expected to be firm next week with the possibility of a minor correction in the coming weeks if growers continue to lift available volumes, industry sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>The key price index, Wool International's (WI) eastern market indicator, has surged since Easter led by wools finer than 22 microns. It jumped 19 cents this week to finish at 678 cents a kg clean, the highest price since September 1995, and up 23 percent on 550 cents in October 1996.  </p>
<p>Wesfarmers Dalgety Ltd said the firmer market has attracted previously withheld stocks both on-farm and in-store, increasing next week's offering by more than 17,000 bales to 72,000 bales.</p>
<p>&quot;If we had not had the increased number of bales coming on next week (the indicator) would probably rise another 20 cents but because those new stocks have become available it will have a dampening effect but not a severe one,&quot; Wesfarmers analyst Kate Coventry told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not see (next week) the 20 cent rises we have seen over the last two weeks but we could easily see a five cent rise,&quot; she said, adding supplies had dropped off since Easter.  </p>
<p>Coventry said there could be a minor correction with further increased offerings scheduled over the next few weeks, but she believed the trend was firm to the end of the 1996/97 season in June due to generally lower stocks and the fact that many growers would wait to release stocks next season.</p>
<p>Bob Quirk, executive director of the Australian Council of Wool Exporters agreed, saying growers were very price-sensitive and he believed they would further withhold wool if the price began to wobble next week.  </p>
<p>&quot;I am sure that under no circumstances would you suddenly just see a big flood or avalanche of this stockpile wool that might really send the market off 30, 40, 50 cents or something like that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wool growers in Australia, the world's largest wool producer, have suffered tough times in the 1990s, with the collapse of the Russian market, recession in western economies, and the end of a domestic reserve price scheme.</p>
<p>As a result wool production has dropped from one billion kg greasy at the beginning of the decade to the 1996/97 estimate of 640 million kg.  </p>
<p>Quirk said price improvements had been expected this year with stocks in Western Europe and Japan intentionally run down in previous seasons due to subdued retail demand.</p>
<p>Moves to refill those stocks had coincided with stronger demand from China and India, particularly for the better quality fine wools, driven by increasingly affluent domestic markets and international demands, he said.</p>
<p>While China, which represented 30 percent of the market, had eased back on demand since the price surge, its purchases for 1996/97 were still up around 30 percent on the same time last year, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;(The short-term outlook) is still very positive I think because of the fact we have a significantly reduced clip compared to previous seasons (and) supplies are going to be relatively constrained compared to the level of ongoing demand,&quot; Quirke said.</p>
<p>But the real key to sustainability would be northern hemisphere 1997 autumn/winter retail sales, he said.</p>
<p>WI sold more than 20,000 bales from its stockpile this week, taking total sales so far for the June quarter to 140,000 bales, already 5,000 bales above its minimum requirement, leaving a 1.71 million bale stockpile.  </p>
<p>Coventry said the fact that WI had also made good inroads to both its September and December quarter requirements was also very positive.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be someone out there who wants to take a forward position like that,&quot; she said.</p>
