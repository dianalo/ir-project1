<p>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) on Friday raised the prospect of selling its TEMCO manganese smelter at Bell Bay in Tasmania.</p>
<p>BHP's managing director John Prescott told a news conference that TEMCO (Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co) did not meet the company's hurdle rates in terms of earnings but that the manganese business as a whole did.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to protect and defend businesses just because they are vertically integrated with something else. We are going to look at them individually and assess what thier true significance is,&quot; Prescott said.  </p>
<p>The TEMCO smelter processes manganese ore from the company's GEMCO (Groote Eylandt Mining Co) mine on Groote Eylandt off the Northern Territory, to produce ferro-alloys.</p>
<p>&quot;TEMCO may be assessed to be on an ongoing basis a pretty good part of the (manganese business),&quot; Prescott said.</p>
<p>Prescott said there were a lot of changes going on in the manganese business worldwide and there was a possibility BHP would restructure its TEMCO operations.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past there have been some alliances with other companies which have added value to the manganese business,&quot; Prescott said.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, BHP announced the sale of its Newcastle-based Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide (EMD) plant to Delta Industries Electrical Industries Ltd for A$57 million.</p>
<p>BHP said it expected to make a A$49 million write down on conclusion of the sale.</p>
<p>The EMD plant uses processed ore fines from the TEMCO smelter to make EMD which is used in dry-cell battery manufacture.</p>
<p>Prescott stressed BHP considered its manganese operations were a significant business that the company wanted to develop.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are parts of the business that need to improve their performance but overall it is a significant business for BHP,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The TEMCO plant was established by BHP in 1962 to supply ferro-alloys to the Australian steel industry and now is one of the world's largest manganese alloy producers.</p>
