<p>Zimbabwe leg-spinner Paul Strang completed a match haul of 11 for 186 to bowl Kent to the top of the English county championship table on Monday.</p>
<p>Strang took four for 68 to add to his first innings seven for 118 as Kent snatched a 58-run victory over Lancashire in the penultimate over on the fourth and final day at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>Set a target of 306 off a minimum of 58 overs, Lancashire were all out for 247 after their last six wickets crashed for 44.</p>
<p>England middle order batsman John Crawley struck 91 off 119 balls, with 12 fours, but his dismissal marked the end of Lancashire's push for victory.</p>
<p>On 245 for nine, uncapped pair Jamie Haynes and Paul Ridgway tried to hold out at the finish but the former was bowled by paceman Martin McCague with the fifth ball of the game's penultimate over.</p>
<p>Worcestershire seamer Stuart Lampitt ended a stubborn innings by discarded England wicketkeeper Jack Russell to help inflict Gloucestershire's first championship defeat of the season, at Bristol.</p>
<p>Lampitt prised out Russell for 65 to end a 70-run eighth-wicket stand with Tim Hancock, after the pair had come together at 189 for seven in pursuit of a victory target of 372.</p>
<p>The dismissal of Russell, who had already shared a 57-run seventh-wicket stand with captain Mark Alleyne, was the beginning of the end for Gloucestershire, who went down by 95 runs.</p>
<p>Rain curtailed the fourth and last day at The Oval where Yorkshire, needing 316 to win, were struggling on 115 for four.</p>
<p>Australian Darren Lehmann was unbeaten on 57, adding to his first-innings century, after pace bowler Martin Bicknell had snapped up three for 32.</p>
