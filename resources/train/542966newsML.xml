<p>Bruno Zarrillo scored the tieing and winning goals as Italy stormed back from a three-goal deficit to beat Latvia 5-4 at the ice hockey world championship on Monday.</p>
<p>Zarrillo, the leading scorer in the German hockey league this season, tapped in a loose puck with just over 10 minutes remaining to cap the comeback and give the Italians their first win of the tournament after they trailed 4-1 midway through the second period.</p>
<p>It was the second straight one-goal loss for the Latvians, who are playing in the championships for the first time since 1939 as an independent nation. Latvia dropped an identical 5-4 decision to the United States in their opener on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Latvians looked headed for their first win in 57 years when they exploded for three goals in 97 seconds to take a 4-1 lead.</p>
<p>Latvia's Leonids Tambijevs scored the only goal of the first period. Leo Guiseppe Insam had opened the secord period scoring to pull Italy even at 1-1.</p>
<p>Then Andrei Maticins and Harius Vitolins fired goals 15 seconds apart and Aleksandrs Macijevskis added another a minute later to leave Latvia looking home and dry.</p>
<p>Gaetano Orlando ignited the Italian comeback when he scored to end the second period and reduce Latvia's advantage to 4-2.</p>
<p>Mario Chitarroni continued the comeback in the final period scoring Italy's third and setting the stage for Zarrillo's tying goal.</p>
