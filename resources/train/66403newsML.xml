<title>USA: EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS -  WSC - 20-SEP.</title>
<headline>EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS -  WSC - 20-SEP.</headline>
<text>
<p>Typhoon Willie has already caused very heavy rains, flooding and mudslides on Hainan island in the South China Sea. Damage should become moderate to possibly severe. Willie is now in the Gulf of Tonkin to the northwest of Hainan. Willie will be a major risk to shipping as it tracks across the Gulf during the next 12-24 hours. Shipping is at risk due to strong seas and strong winds. Landfall is expected along the Vietnam coast near 19 north. Winds up to 95 mph and strong seas will cause coastal damage near landfall. Heavy rains will lead to flooding and mudslides as the system moves inland thereafter. Damage could become moderate to severe.  </p>
<p>Typhoon Violet is about 300 miles east  of Okinawa, Japan at this time, moving very slowly to the north. This system will begin to accelerate to the northeast over the next 24 hours. Top winds, now near 105 mph, should be down to near 75 mph by 48 hours. Violet is mainly a threat to shipping at this time, though high swells are expected to continue along south-facing and east-facing coastal areas of Japan. Violet threatens Honshu late in the period. Honshu can expect heavy rains which should cause flooding and may cause mudslides. Coastal areas can expect strong winds and strong seas which would cause beach errosion. If the system comes closer to the coast the conditions would be much more serious.  </p>
<p>Tom is losing tropical characteristics. The tropical storm, with top winds of 50 mph, is tranitioning to an extratropical weather system in the northwestern Pacific and should be fully converted to such by 12 hours.</p>
