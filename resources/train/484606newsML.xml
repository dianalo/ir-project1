<p>Two senior U.S. officials were in northern Iraq on Thursday talking to leaders of the two rival Kurdish factions there, the State Department said.</p>
<p>David Welch, acting assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, and Robert Deutsch, head of the State Department's Iran and Iraq office, were meeting leaders of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The two groups battled for two months last year in northern Iraq, which has effectively been under Western protection since 1991, after the KDP sought aid from Iraqi forces to help it capture the city of Arbil from its rival.</p>
<p>The United States brokered a ceasefire in October, and the two groups have been conducting sporadic peace talks in Ankara since then.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Thursday's talks, which also involved representatives of the Turcoman and Assyrian minorities in the area, were &quot;focusing on the Ankara peace process&quot; but gave no further details.</p>
<p>The KDP walked out of the Ankara talks last month, accusing the PUK of killing one of its officials in the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja. The PUK denied the charge.</p>
