<p>Interest in mining shares buoyed by a bullish outlook for some metals helped the Lima Stock Exchange close up 0.51 percent Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for zinc, particularly, and tin, in a second place, is that they stay bullish due to falls in reserves around the world,&quot; said analyst Manuel Torres of Finvest.</p>
<p>Wednesday's session also promises higher share prices, or at least stable prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Torres said that the brewing sector is currently a good buy, and attracting investor interest.  </p>
<p>The general index rose 0.51 percent to 1,622.38, and the blue-chip selective index rose 0.54 percent to 2,323.79.</p>
<p>Thirty shares ended up, 39 were unchanged, and 28 fell. Volume was 40.9 million soles ($15.6 million).</p>
<p>The market was still hanging on for the release of January's gross domestic product figures, due any day now.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that once the official production figure is published and the country's macroeconomic improvement is confirmed, the Peruvian market will look more attractive and attract more business,&quot; said trader Flavio Campos, of Finanval.  </p>
<p>  Mining stock Morocha rose 3.09 percent, brewer Backus y Johnston rose 1.32 percent, and mining firm Minsur closed up 0.21 percent.</p>
<p>    Bellwether Telefonica del Peru &quot;B&quot; rose 0.17 percent, and beer producer Compania Nacional de Cerveza (CNC) closed 0.73 percent higher.</p>
<p>    But Campos cautioned that some investors were set to abandon Telefonica for more volatile stocks.</p>
<p>    Torres recommended CNC, which is seeing benefits such as lower operating costs from its merger with Backus at the</p>
<p>beginning of the year.</p>
<p>    Mining stock Buenaventura lost 2.29 percent. Electric firm Edegel lost 0.78 percent, and utility Luz del Sur slipped 0.31 percent.     The most traded stocks were Telefonica, with 36.22 percent of total volume, and Backus, with 8.86 percent.</p>
