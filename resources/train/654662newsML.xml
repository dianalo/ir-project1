<headline>FOCUS - Kinkel says France wants stability pact.</headline>

<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Wednesday he was certain France would keep to a stability pact underpinning European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Kinkel told the German lower house of parliament he was also sure France would adhere to the strict criteria for European economic and monetary union (EMU) and join the planned launch of Europe's single currency on time.</p>
<p>Signalling a policy change, he said Germany was prepared to agree to a jobs chapter at a European Union summit in Amsterdam next week. But he added that it would only do this as long as this did not incur extra EU spending.</p>
<p>&quot;It (France) will adhere to the stability pact and -- just like the German government -- it will launch the euro on time according to the stability criteria,&quot; Kinkel said, in a government declaration to parliament on the Amsterdam summit.</p>
<p>Kinkel warned those who were pushing for a delay in Europe's planned single currency, the euro, that they could derail the project altogether.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who support a delay (in EMU) must realise they will bring about an end of this ambitious project and those (who support delay) must also realise they are doing enormous damage to our country,&quot; Kinkel said.</p>
<p>Kinkel said Bonn would agree to a jobs chapter being included in the Maastricht Treaty under certain conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want any unaccountable, unfinanceable or expensive spending programmes. An improved coordination of national measures on European level can take us further. On these terms, the German government will agree to a jobs chapter.&quot;</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition, in a parliamentary motion due to be voted on after the debate, also insisted it would not agree to any initiative which meant the transfer of additional funds by the European Union.</p>
<p>In a draft paper the coalition said on Tuesday that tighter coordination of jobs policies on the part of EU members could be possible without transferring additional powers to Brussels.</p>
<p>This could also include a sharper orientation of  European social fund towards jobs-related projects.</p>
<p>Germany had opposed the idea of a jobs chapter for years, fearing it could lead to economic growth-led policies that in turn would counteract the monetary discipline a future independent European central bank would seek to impose.</p>
