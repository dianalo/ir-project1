<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will try to end a political quarrel which has shaken Israel's government by holding talks with Foreign Minister David Levy on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The prime minister's office said the two men would meet at 12:30 p.m. (0930 GMT). It will be their first confrontation since the disgruntled foreign minister threatened on Monday to quit over the way the government was run.</p>
<p>Levy, a political veteran, accused Netanyahu of keeping him in the dark on important issues including political appointments and Middle East peace moves.</p>
<p>Analysts predicted the government would survive the crisis, which underscored growing disenchantment with the prime minister and with a three-and-a-half-month-old impasse in peacemaking because of Jewish settlement construction.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, clearly hoping to placate Levy,  told reporters on Tuesday: &quot;I believe the most natural thing from my standpoint is that the foreign minister guide the daily work between us and the Palestinians. I believe a way will be found also to implement this.&quot;</p>
<p>Levy's threat to resign was triggered by a media disclosure last week that National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon secretly met top Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
<p>Levy said he would have supported the meeting but complained that he had not been informed about it.</p>
<p>Sharon ruled out a meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the heels of his talks with Abbas, the Palestinian negotiatior of the 1993 peace accord with Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;I always said I am willing to meet Palestinians. With Arafat I was not willing to meet, I am not willing to meet and I will not be willing to meet,&quot; Sharon told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Levy has said his Gesher faction, with five of the 66 coalition seats in the 120-member parliament, is disappointed by Netanyahu's failure to advance peace moves or to improve life for low-income Israelis.</p>
<p>If Levy took Gesher out of the government, Netanyahu's fate would depend on an unstable parliamentary majority of one built on rebellious Likud members who are also threatening to bolt.</p>
<p>Two ministers have already left the cabinet. Netanyahu had hoped to get parliamentary approval on Monday for Sharon to replace one of them, Dan Meridor, as finance minister.</p>
