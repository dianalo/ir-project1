<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- negative tone seen for day.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bond traders said they expect the tone to turn negative as action gets underway on the new week.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got supply coming in, we're looking for munis to underperform Treasuries,&quot; one trader said. A lower government long bond was also seen as a bad omen for Monday's trends. The 30-year bond was lost 4/32 at 97-14/32 to yield 6.83 percent.</p>
<p>Action in the municipal market so far Monday was typically light, as traders said the week's new issue calendar Tuesday would likely be the catalyst for any significant trading.</p>
<p>This week's new issues are expected to total $4.4 billion in 107 sales, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.</p>
<p>Negotiated offerings total $2.9 billion in 51 sales, with a $709 million Puerto Rico issue through Lehman Brothers topping the list.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, 56 sales totaling 1.5 billion are on the schedule. The largest is a $556 million Pennsylvania deal on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The municipal market on Friday gained about 3/8 point, after the February jobs report hinted at tame wage inflation.</p>
<p>The Labor Deparment reported non-farm payrolls rose 339,000 in February compared to a downwardly revised 247,000 increase in Janaury. Economists had expected a 230,000 rise last month.</p>
<p>In futures action Monday, the June municipal contract was off 4/32 at 114-2/32, while June T-bonds were up 1/32 at 110-4/32. The MOB spread was 126 ticks, narrowing from 131 at the close on Thursday.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary market issues, bids on Florida Ports Commission MBIA 5-3/8s of 2027 were down two basis points to 5.81 percent net.</p>
<p>Bids on Ohio Turnpike Commission MBIA 5-1/2s of 2026 were unchanged at 97-1/4, after gaining 1/2 point on Friday.</p>
