<title>CHINA: China says Taiwan independence drive slows trade.</title>
<headline>China says Taiwan independence drive slows trade.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1996-12-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>China said on Sunday its trade with Taiwan was being held back by a pro-independence drive led by the island's President Lee Teng-hui.</p>
<p>The Business Weekly -- published by the official China Daily -- also accused Taiwan's political leaders of trying to hold back investment on the China mainland, a move that was also restraining trade.</p>
<p>It said trade across the Taiwan Strait would probably increase three percent this year to $18.4 billion after a rise of 9.5 percent in 1995 over the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;The setback was the result of the independence movement led by &quot;president' Lee Teng-hui,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China and Taiwan have been at loggerheads since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 when the Nationalist government fled to the island after its defeat by the communists on the mainland.</p>
<p>China, which insists Taiwan is a rebel province that is not entitled to formal ties with other states, has been incensed by President Lee's campaign to raise the island's international profile.</p>
<p>Beijing says Lee is seeking independence for the island, a charge the Taiwan leader denies.</p>
<p>&quot;A strained relationship has a negative influence on the development of cross-strait economic ties,&quot; Wang Hui, a deputy director general of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The paper said trade rose 18 percent in January and 11 percent in February but then slumped in May and June.</p>
<p>It did not mention that China conducted missile tests and held war games near Taiwan in March in a bid to intimidate voters ahead of the island's first direct president elections, which Lee won easily.</p>
<p>It also avoided any reference to China's long-standing policy of refusing to rule out the use of force to reunify the island.</p>
<p>The newspaper accused Taiwan authorities of blocking investment, particularly by larger companies. That in turn had contributed to the slower rise in trade, it said, adding that about 85 percent of trade was linked to investment projects.</p>
<p>Taiwan companies signed contracts for 2,400 investment projects in China during the first nine months of the year, down 21.4 percent from a year ago, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The value of the contracted projects was up 16.6 percent at $4.38 billion, however.</p>
<p>Taiwan bans direct trade and investment with China so the flow of goods and capital goes through another destination, usually Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Beijing official also complained that Taiwan's trade barriers were blocking Chinese exports and resulting in an unfavourable balance of trade, which he called an abnormal trade pattern.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Chinese imports from Taiwan reached $12.2 billion in the first 10 months of this year, up 3.3 percent, while exports to the island were $458 million, down 9.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;A constant trade deficit on the mainland, resulting from obstacles on the island province, is abnormal,&quot; Wang said.</p>
