<p>Rio de Janeiro's carnival shifted into top gear on Sunday as Donald Duck, parrot Joe Carioca and a flood of other Disney characters kicked off the first of two dusk-to-dawn parades by Rio's samba school elite.</p>
<p>The enormous cartoon-figure replicas delighted the crowds packed into Rio's 70,000-capacity sambadrome stadium, but the G-string-clad, bare-breasted dancing girls Rio's carnival orgy is famous for were noticeably absent from the opening act.</p>
<p>Disney agreed to finance much of the parade by the Academicos da Rocinha samba school from Latin America's largest shantytown on the condition that there would be no nudity.</p>
<p>But spectators did not have to wait long for the traditional samba-dancing beauties in glittering tangas which leave little to the imagination, as the next school made its entrance.</p>
<p>Fireworks, dry ice and confetti filled the tropical air as the seemingly endless streams of revellers and dancers drifted down the 500-yard (meter) sambadrome to the beat of hundreds of pounding drums.</p>
<p>Each year Rio's carnival builds up over the weekend before exploding in a blaze of colour, sequined glamour, feathers and flesh on Sunday and Monday nights, when the so-called &quot;special group&quot; schools stage their parades with ornate floats and extravagant costumes.</p>
<p>Numbering several thousand dancers and with million-dollar budgets which are often bankrolled by Rio's organised crime bosses, the 16 schools compete fiercely to become champions.</p>
<p>Rio's world famous carnival extravaganza, billed as the biggest party in the world, swung into action on Friday with an opening ceremony in the city centre and parades by the lowest of the second-tier samba schools, which hope to climb the ranks to the special group.</p>
<p>Sunday newspapers reported that Friday's parades claimed the first victims of this year's carnival, despite heavy security.</p>
<p>City authorities have dispatched some 3,000 police officers to the sambadrome to ensure safety. But one spectator who did not want to pay for a ticket, which can cost anything from about $5 to nearly $30,000 for an avenue-side box, fell off a viaduct overlooking the sambadrome and died.</p>
<p>Ever since Rio's carnival moved from the city's streets to the purpose-built sambadrome in 1984, the overpass which runs alongside it has become an alternative for revellers without an entrance ticket.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a 13-year-old boy fell victim to Rio's urban violence when a stray bullet hit him in the nose and nearly killed him as he was watching the parades with his parents.</p>
