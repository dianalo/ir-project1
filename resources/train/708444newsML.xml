<p>Burma's military rulers have shrugged off a request by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that they hold talks with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Thai officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The ASEAN request was conveyed to leaders of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) last month by Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi when he visited Rangoon, a Thai official told Reuters.</p>
<p>SLORC would not agree to the talks, he said. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party has never been allowed to rule despite its landslide victory in a 1990 poll. ASEAN foreign ministers held another meeting on Tuesday while in Hong Kong to witness the return of the former British colony to China and agreed to reiterate their position, a Thai foreign ministry source said.</p>
<p>ASEAN, which comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, agreed in May to accept Burma, Laos, and Cambodia as new members.</p>
<p>The decision was widely criticised because of human rights violations in Burma and concerns about political instability in Cambodia.</p>
<p>The Thai official said he thought SLORC would never hold talks with Suu Kyi and would ignore anyone who asked them to. He also predicted the SLORC would hold on to power for several more years.</p>
<p>&quot;ASEAN's effort to urge SLORC to hold talks with Aung San Suu Kyi will be fruitless,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Burma's deputy prime minister Maung Maung Khin on Thursday rejected any dialogue between SLORC and Suu Kyi during a visit to Manila on Thursday.</p>
<p>SLORC was formed after the military crushed a popular uprising in September 1988, killing or jailing thousands of pro-democracy supporters. The military government has ruled Burma with an iron grip ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;SLORC cited national security and economic development for their reasons to continue in office for several more years. I don't think there will be an election in Burma in the next 10 years,&quot; said an ASEAN official close to the Burmese generals.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi has urged the SLORC to recognise the results of the 1990 poll but the government has never responded. It also refuses to answer her call for dialogue which she has made since being released from six years of house arrest in July, 1995.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi, 52, who has been in poor health for the past few months, was injured last month when she slipped down a staircase at her lakeside Rangoon residence.</p>
