<p>The United States is closely watching developments involving North Korean defectors after a shooting incident near Seoul left one seriously wounded, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an incident that is serious,&quot; Richardson said on ABC Television's &quot;This Week&quot; program. &quot;This is an incident that we're watching very closely.&quot;</p>
<p>He said U.S. intelligence analysts doubted North Korea was on the verge of collapse but were closely monitoring developments in the economically backward communist country.</p>
<p>&quot;Our intelligence people claim that there is not a threat of an imminent collapse, but there's a tense situation there,&quot; Richardson said. &quot;We have to watch it very closely. We're concerned about this defector situation.</p>
<p>&quot;We urge North Korea to live up to the agreement that they made on the submarine incident, when they apologized, and part of that agreement with South Korea was, number one, that they not engage in provocative actions.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to North Korea's apology for sending a spy submarine to a South Korean beach in September last year and landing 26 armed commandos who were then captured.</p>
<p>Late on Saturday, two gunmen shot and seriously wounded a North Korean defector near South Korea's capital Seoul and police believe it was the work of North Korea's regime. The attack came as China agonized over what to do about Hwang Jang-yop, a high ranking member of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party who is holed up in the South Korean mission in Beijing seeking asylum in the South.</p>
<p>Richardson said he had met the North Korean official on a visit to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe I did meet him on my first trip there,&quot; he said. &quot;He was speaker of the house. I remember him being very hard line. I know he's being described as a writer, an intellectual. He didn't strike me as that. He struck me more as a sort of a party leader.&quot;</p>
<p>A South Korean police officer told Reuters he suspected North Korean agents carried out the shooting to send Seoul a warning over the defection in Beijing. Police identified the injured man as Li Il-nam, known in South Korea as Lee Han-yong, who they said had defected in the early 1980s via Europe where he had been studying.</p>
<p>Tensions mounted after Hwang arrived by taxi on Wednesday at Seoul's diplomatic mission in Beijing. South Korea says he sought asylum, while North Korea insists he was kidnapped.</p>
<p>China must decide whether to allow him to be flown to Seoul or to send him back to Pyongyang.</p>
