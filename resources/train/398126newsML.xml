<p>A former insurance and mutual fund agent with John Hancock Insurance was sentenced to 40 months in prison for stealing nearly $200,000 from elderly clients, the Massachusetts Attorney General's office said Monday.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Gruber, 33, of Sharon, Mass., pled guilty to five counts of larceny over $250 and 22 counts of forgery-related charges.</p>
<p>Gruber, who was fired from Hancock for alleged misconduct in 1992, stole $194,600 from four elderly clients, including two recently widowed women who had relied on their husbands to handle finances.</p>
<p>Gruber allegedly deposited his clients' money into his personal account rather than invest it in securities and mutual funds, the state Attorney General's office said. Gruber also allegedly withdrew money from their John Hancock accounts and kept the funds for his own use.</p>
<p>Norfolk Superior Court Judge Stephen Neel sentenced Gruber to 40 months in prison, to be followed by three years probation and ordered him to pay $194,600 in restitution to the victims.</p>
