<p>Italian bond futures reversed early gains to trade lower in late afternoon following other bond markets lower such as bunds and Treasuries, while the lower lira also weighed on market sentiment, dealers said.</p>
<p>They added that there was some nervousness head of the EU summit in Dublin at the weekend and the little progress made on a stability pact which will aim to keep individual nation's public finances in order after EMU is launched.</p>
<p>&quot;The market ran up to near record highs early so there was always the risk of profit-taking if other markets faded away,&quot; said one LIFFE trader.  </p>
<p>The Italian market had gained early encouraged by the strong dollar and as other European markets continued to recover from Friday's sell-off while Italy's Treasury minister called for a cut in interest rates.</p>
<p>Treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said that time was right for a further cut in Italian interest rate in a interview with La Repubblic newspaper and many dealers see a decline in rates coming after preliminary Dec CPI figures later this month.</p>
<p>Weak data on the Italian car market with registrations in November off 11.44 percent at 134,000 also helped the bond market to higher levels early, they added.  </p>
<p>Dealers said that Ciampi comments added to the pressure on the Bank of Italy to cut rates with prime minster Romano Prodi already calling for lower interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looked at the slide in bunds and Treasuries and said enough was enough,&quot; said the LIFFE trader.</p>
