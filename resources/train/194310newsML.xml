<p>The Zimbabwe dollar held steady on the mark but was quoted softer against other hard currencies on the back of slight import pressure on Friday morning, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an order for about $5.3 million this morning and the local dollar has depreciated slightly. But it's a small panic though and things should return to normal sometime in the afternoon,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>He and others however re-iterated that a strike by junior doctors and nurses to press for better salaries and working conditions, now going for its fourth week, had not affected the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>At around 0755 GMT the local unit was trading at 10.6500/6700 against the U.S. dollar, down from the 10.6400/6600 perch it had occupied for the past four days.</p>
<p>It also fell to 17.7700/7900 from 17.7100/7300 against pound sterling, tracking an easier U.S. dollar overseas and was at 2.2700/2900 from Thursday's 2.2600/2800 against South Africa's rand. Against the mark however, it was quoted unchanged at 7.0600/0800. -- Stella Mapenzauswa, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 28/9</p>
