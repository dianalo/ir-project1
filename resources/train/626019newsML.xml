<headline>Britain's Oxford unveils new plan for Saudi school.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's Oxford University said on Friday it had found a new home for a controversial business school to be part-funded by Saudi entrepreneur Wafic Said.</p>
<p>&quot;The creation of a world-class business school at Oxford has been an important objective for the university since 1990,&quot; said the university's vice-chancellor Peter North.</p>
<p>North praised Said's &quot;almost unparalleled generosity&quot; and expressed hope the university could get over &quot;past controversies&quot; to make his vision a reality.</p>
<p>Said's ambitious project -- and benefaction of 20 million pounds ($33 million) -- has fierce opponents at the ancient university.</p>
<p>Critics are wary of Said's influence over the business school's affairs and angry at the manner in which the university has handled the project.</p>
<p>Previous plans to build the school on a sports field were rejected by the so-called congregation: a parliament of university dons. Oxford had promised to preserve the fields as a green site.</p>
<p>The dons (college fellows) must now approve the new, alternative site close to the city railway station at a meeting slated for June 17.</p>
<p>The university said it and Said had agreed on the alternative site after &quot;consideration of the relevant issues&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;An exhaustive search found it to be the only available site which was central, financeable and of a scale appropriate to the intended prestige of the new institution,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Said Business Foundation would oversee the construction and aid the development of the school but would have no say in academic issues or the day-to-day running of the school.</p>
<p>Oxford said four of the trustees would be appointed by Said, to include himself, a further four by the vice-chancellor and the remaining two by top business figures.</p>
<p>&quot;These arrangements achieve the benefactor's objective of the majority of the trustees coming from the world of business,&quot; Oxford said.</p>
<p>Previous plans had given Said a say in six of the appointments, a proposal rejected by many university staff as too interfering. ($ = 0.610 British Pounds)</p>
