<p>CSCE world July sugar futures were lower in brisk midsession trade Wednesday as speculators continued to sell the July/October spread, traders said.</p>
<p>The switch grew to 0.17 cent October premium as of 1135 EDT, compared with 0.07 cent on Tuesday's close. The trade was a steady buyer of the most-active October contract, and a noted buyer of the March/May switch, dealers said.</p>
<p>The speculators are likely to continue to sell the spread but outright activity should remain mostly rangebound, ahead of the expiry of July on June 30.</p>
<p>Support in October was pegged at 11.00 cents and then at the recent low of 10.96 cents in October, where sell stops have been cited. The trade should hold October well above its downside target through the expiry of July, traders said.</p>
<p>At 1135 EDT, July was down 0.02 cent at 11.06 cents per lb, traded 11.07 to 11.00 cents. October stood 0.08 cent higher at 11.23 cents, while the rest of the board was trading 0.08 higher to 0.01 lower.</p>
<p>Open interest in the benchmark October contract rose by 1,521 lots to 86,936 lots as of Tuesday. July lost 2,183 lots, putting open interest in the front month at 28,775 lots.</p>
<p>An estimated 19,121 lots changed hands as of 1100 EDT.</p>
