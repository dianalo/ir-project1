<title>USA: U.S. corporate bond spreads tighten in thin trade.</title>
<headline>U.S. corporate bond spreads tighten in thin trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-02</dateline>

<p>U.S. corporate bond spreads enjoyed one to two basis points of tightening on Thursday after indications of a brisk manufacturing sector sent government securities sharply lower, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Treasury yield backup sparked buying across all high-grade corporate bond sectors with cable and tobacco names faring best, said one trader at a big New York shop. Talk of better buying was couched in light volume, however, with hosts of sell- and buy-siders extending holidays through week's end.</p>
<p>Volume came from the bigger accounts but was still estimated at around 25 percent of a normal day.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's particular buying from insurance companies, at least in the 10-year sector,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Not a groundswell, though -- yield bogeys are being hit and that's really the driving force,&quot; he said, referring to targeted levels which trigger buying for many traders.</p>
<p>Upticks in the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) overall and price indeces sent Treasuries down more than one point at mid-morning, analysts said. The NAPM index rose to 54.0 in December against 52.7 in November while the price index rose to 51.5 from 45.9.  </p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year T-bond closed off its lows but down 1-6/32 at 96-30/32 to yield 6.74 percent. Some government bond traders pegged 6.85 percent as the next stop for the T-bond.</p>
<p>Back in corporates, Tele-Communications Inc debt was solidly bid and spreads tightened by two basis points on average, a trader said. TCI 6-7/8 percent senior notes of 2006 traded in a 87 basis point bid, 82 basis point offer market.</p>
<p>One market participant said a front-page Wall Street Journal article of Thursday sparked some interest in the company's bonds.  </p>
<p>Turning to high-yielders, the ailing Treasury market was blamed for price erosion there and most paper was quoted off 1/2 to one point. Some retailers, including CompUSA Inc, took the brunt of losses after disappointing holiday sales reports.</p>
<p>CompUSA's 9-1/2s of 2000 were seen off one point to a 102-1/4 bid, 102-3/8 offer, one trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers stressed perceptions of strong fundamentals and cash-laden investors underpinned the broad market, which allowed improvements on a spread basis.</p>
<p>High-yield desks were better staffed on Thursday although the head-count failed to translate into activity. Like in high-grades, however, high-yield activity would likely be minimal until early next week.</p>
<p>&quot;No one is willing to make a trade,&quot; one high-yield trader said. &quot;I think a lot of junior guys are holding down desks and they could get a little nervous making a trade down here.&quot;</p>
<p>There were no straight corporate debt issues priced on Thursday. Several medium-sized high-yield issues were in the works for January, syndicates said.</p>
