<p>Police in Northern Ireland said on Saturday they were investigating reports of an explosion in County Fermanagh in the west of the British-ruled province.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the blast had apparently occurred outside an unoccupied police station in the village of Tempo. He said no injuries had been reported.  </p>
<p>The incident occurred during a period of heightened tension in the province after an upsurge in IRA guerrilla activities and two recent attacks on Catholics which were widely blamed on pro-British loyalist extremists.</p>
<p>The Irish Republican Army abandoned a 17-month ceasefire in February last year with a bombing campaign in English cities which it extended to Northern Ireland in October.</p>
<p>Security has been tightened across the province to counter a growing guerrilla threat which sparked fears of renewed sectarian warfare between Catholic and Protestant militants.</p>
<p>Britain says the IRA must call a truce before its Sinn Fein political wing is allowed into struggling multi-party peace which are due to restart in Belfast on Monday.</p>
