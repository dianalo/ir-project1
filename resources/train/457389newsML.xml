<p>By Alan Elsner, U.S. Political Correspondent</p>
<p>A silver-haired man, accompanied by his wife and one assistant, strolled into the departures lounge at Washington's National Airport the other day and nobody recognised him.</p>
<p>Only six months ago, Jack Kemp was the Republican party's vice presidential candidate, travelling on his own plane with Secret Service agents, support staff, advisers, strategists, speechwriters, schedulers, TV crews and reporters.</p>
<p>Now, as Kemp reported for a flight to Buffalo, he handed over his driver's license for identification. &quot;Did you pack yourself? Have your bags been with you all the time? Did anyone give you a package to carry?&quot; the clerk asked, with no glimmer of recognition of the man standing before him.</p>
<p>Welcome to the twilight world of the permanent presidential campaign. The next election is 43 months away in November 2000 but time already is growing short. While the subject could not be further from most voters' minds, a handful of people are planning, plotting and working toward it.</p>
<p>&quot;We're spending 25 days a month on the road, travelling very aggressively, laying the groundwork for a potential candidacy. We wouldn't be out here doing this if he wasn't taking this very seriously,&quot; a Kemp aide said.</p>
<p>KEMP HAS COMPANY</p>
<p>And Kemp is hardly the only one. At least three other Republicans and two Democrats are actively putting in place the foundations for an eventual campaign. Others are watching from the sidelines to see if potential rivals stumble, while still others must run in state or congressional elections next year as a prelude to a possible run for the White House.</p>
<p>On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore remains the frontrunner. Supported by President Bill Clinton, he has placed allies in key positions in the White House and the party.</p>
<p>But Gore recently stumbled over revelations that he made fund-raising calls last year from the White House. His attempts to defend himself seemed clumsy and unconvincing to many, and that opened the way for other Democrats to dream.</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt is beginning to make life difficult for Clinton, and by extension for Gore, in Congress. He is manoeuvring for support among labour unions.</p>
<p>On the Republican side, Kemp may be the most active future candidate at this point, although he insists it is too early even to talk about another presidential bid.</p>
<p>&quot;The American people have just been through a very vigorous campaign. I enjoyed it, loved it. It whetted my appetite but I'm not going to do anything until after the 1998 (congressional) elections,&quot; Kemp says to those who ask.</p>
<p>Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, both of whom ran in 1996, seem eager to run again. &quot;I want to spend the next couple of years helping our party develop its sense of mission and its message more clearly and then I may volunteer to be its messenger once more,&quot; Alexander said last week.</p>
<p>CAN DAN QUAYLE COME BACK?</p>
<p>Former Vice President Dan Quayle also appears to be seriously considering a run and has hired a top strategist. And many believe George W. Bush, son of the former president, would be a powerful candidate. But first he must win re-election as governor of Texas next year.</p>
<p>There is a definite rhythm to the four-year U.S. presidential cycle. In year one, a potential candidate establishes a political action committee and raises money from supporters so that he or she can travel the country. The candidate addresses many party dinners, shakes many hands, meets potential donors, tries to make allies and begins to build a computer data base of future supporters, while testing themes for a future candidacy among the party faithful and beginning to develop a message.</p>
<p>In year two, the future candidate becomes the loyal party soldier. He campaigns selflessly for others in the mid-term congressional and state elections. His committee gives money to carefully selected allies. He tries to appear on television as much as possible. He may write a book.</p>
<p>As soon as the mid-terms are over, the dash for campaign money begins in earnest. As year three dawns, politicians begin to declare their candidacies officially. They race around the country holding fund-raising events, set up headquarters, hook up phones and computers and hire staff in key states. They also print bumper stickers, distribute campaign buttons and try to build enthusiasm.</p>
<p>And above all, they make telephone calls, perhaps hundreds a day, in an effort to raise another $50,000 each and every day.</p>
<p>HARDER THAN IT LOOKS</p>
<p>&quot;A candidate who runs will have to be able to raise at least $15 million during 1999,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;That's the hard part, to raise it when nobody is paying attention in amounts of $1,000 or less. There will probably only be three or four Republicans who actually are capable of doing that. It's harder than it looks.&quot;</p>
<p>Most candidates say they hate fund raising. &quot;I'm not good at it, I don't like it and it is one of the benchmarks around which I will make a judgment as to whether or not it is appropriate for me to run,&quot; Kemp said.</p>
<p>Finally, year four dawns and with it the rush of state primaries and caucuses to decide the two party nominees. Candidates who fail to achive early success quickly run out of money and drop out. For most hopefuls, after all the work, the campaign is over amazingly quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;I basically went from one percent in the polls last January to nearly winning the New Hampshire primary a month later. And then back to one percent,&quot; Alexander said, reflecting on his brief moment in the limelight. &quot;Like an Olympic  sprinter, you train for years and your chance to win comes and goes in a flash.&quot;</p>
