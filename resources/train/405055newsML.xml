<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman said on Wednesday he was convinced the Middle East peace process was still on track despite protests over Israeli construction plans for Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very optimistic about the future with ups and downs like you have today -- but we will overcome it,&quot; he told reporters after meeting British Prime Minister John Major.</p>
<p>Palestinian and Israeli leftists have warned that a plan to build a new Jewish neighbourhood in Arab East Jerusalem would be a blueprint for trouble and ignite Arab fury.</p>
<p>But Weizman, calling for calm, insisted: &quot;People should realise how much we have achieved in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first 30 years after the establishment of the state of Israel, we were at each other's throats,&quot; he added on the first visit to Britain by an Israeli head of state since it was founded 49 years ago.</p>
<p>The plan to build 6,500 homes for Jews on a hill taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war has sparked fears that violence could erupt again.</p>
<p>Sixty-one Arabs and 15 Israelis were killed in clashes after hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided last September to open an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Weizman struck a purposefully optimistic note after his talks with Major, telling reporters: &quot;I hope that in the foreseeable future -- -whether it is five years, three years, two years -- we will have peace with all the Arab nations and sail merrily into the 21st century.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu has appealed to Palestinians not to resort to violence and Weizman echoed his call. &quot;I recommend to the Palestinian authorities and all parties that are worried that this should not be a stumbling block. We will overcome it and see Jerusalem blooming and building both for Arabs and Jews at the same time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council has expressed concern over the Israeli settlement plans and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said they were aimed at making demographic changes that went against the peace process.</p>
<p>Pressed by reporters, Major was careful to adopt an even-handed approach in what is potentially an explosive situation.</p>
<p>&quot;What we have tried to do is act as a facilitator. I don't think it is our job to add to the difficulties. It is our job to add to the solutions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Weizman confirmed on Wednesday that he had invited Britain's Queen Elizabeth to visit his country.</p>
<p>&quot;I have done so at a dinner last night,&quot; he told BBC Radio. &quot;If she has difficulties politically I will not press the point.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials said the queen looked forward to taking up the invitation at a &quot;mutually convenient time&quot; but indicated a trip to Israel was not imminent.</p>
