<p>Australian Mark Philippoussis, the fastest server on the circuit, won the London grass court title on Sunday with a thumping 7-5 6-3 victory over fellow big-hitter Goran Ivanisevic.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old from Melbourne, who holds the record of 229 kph for the fastest serve ever measured, banged down 15 aces in an almost error-free display of power tennis.</p>
<p>There were only two break points in the match - in the 12th game of the first set and the eighth of the second and Philippoussis, playing his most consistent tennis of the week, made no mistake.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic, who said he was concentrating too much on returning his opponent's serve and not enough on his own game, made a couple of volleying errors in the first set and played two loose shots in the second to lose the match.</p>
<p>&quot;I played two bad service games,&quot; the world number three said. &quot;He was serving really well.&quot;</p>
<p>Ivanisevic, like Philippoussis, a lofty 1.94 metres tall, hit 12 aces in the match which produced only a handful of rallies longer than four shots.</p>
<p>The longest exchange happened after a frustrated  Ivanisevic offered his racket to ball girl Amy Kavanagh at 3-3 in the second set. Philippoussis played a gentle rally of 17 shots with the girl before gallantly losing the point.</p>
<p>The result gives the Australian, ranked 19th going into the tournament, his third title of the year after Scottsdale and Munich and a boost before Wimbledon starts on June 23.</p>
<p>Philippoussis, nicknamed Scud because of his ferocious serve, said he had matured over the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;Every year I'm a better player, everything is coming together and I say to myself there is nothing I can't win now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been working on my movement, which is important on grass, where the ball goes so fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Philippoussis who has now won a tournament on every surface -- clay, indoor, cement and grass -- began the match as he intended to go on, with three successive aces.</p>
<p>The encounter looked certain to be heading for a tie-break without a single deuce or break point until the 12th game, when Ivanisevic put two volleys long to hand the Australian the set.</p>
<p>Philippoussis's only wobble came after the ball-girl incident when at 40-0 up he double faulted and netted an easy volley. But he came back with an ace to take the game.</p>
<p>At 3-4 down, Ivanisevic lost his serve after Philippoussis produced two lovely passes and the Croat put a shot long.</p>
<p>Philippoussis then served out to 15 for the match.</p>
<p>&quot;I did nothing wrong this week. I'm really looking forward to Wimbledon now,&quot; the Australian, the first to win at Queen's since Tony Roche in 1978, said.</p>
