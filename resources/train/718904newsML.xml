<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton visits Bucharest on Friday to encourage Romania, passed over by Washington for early NATO membership, to move fast to catch up with more advanced East Europeans invited into the alliance.</p>
<p>Clinton, the first U.S. President to visit Romania in 22 years, arrives from Warsaw and will spend eight hours in a capital already clogged by traffic jams after authorities scrubbed streets and sealed off major thoroughfares 24 hours in advance.</p>
<p>The highlight of the visit will be a speech alongside Romanian President Emil Constantinescu in a square where students were shot dead during the 1989 anti-communist revolt.</p>
<p>The visit, three days after NATO leaders agreed to limit initial expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, will signal the end of Romania's post-communist isolation.</p>
<p>Romania's new centrist leaders have gracefully accepted that they have to wait for the next round of admissions after transforming the country from a no-hoper into a leading candidate for membership with seven months of reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;This visit is not a consolation prize for Romanians,&quot; outgoing U.S. ambassador Alfred Moses said in an interview. &quot;He (Clinton) is going to Poland to congratulate the Poles. He is coming here to say Romania is on the doorstep to joining NATO and that the door will remain open.&quot;</p>
<p>Romania's break with communism was more dramatic and bloody than those in any of the three successful NATO entrants.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people were killed in the 1989 uprising that overthrew Nicolae Ceausescu, whose 24-year rule grew into one of eastern Europe's harshest Communist regimes.</p>
<p>In his early rule, Ceausescu was lionised by the United States for bucking Soviet-dictated policy. Two U.S. leaders visited Bucharest -- Richard Nixon in 1969 and his successor Gerald Ford six years later.</p>
<p>At the height of the Cold War, Romania was the sole east European country to set up ties with West Germany in 1967 and refused to obey Moscow's injunction to sever ties with Israel after the Six Day War.</p>
<p>Romania also rejected Moscow's orders to send troops to quell Czechoslovakia's 1968 &quot;Prague Spring&quot;.</p>
<p>In the early post-communist years, with ex-communist Ion Iliescu in power, Western leaders shunned Romania after outbreaks of political and ethnic violence.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac and Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi were the first to visit Romania this year, after a gap of six years.</p>
<p>Clinton is certain to praise the progress achieved by Constantinescu and the centrist government elected last November. He has singled out new treaties settling old rifts with neighbours Hungary and Ukraine, and the inclusion of ethnic Hungarians in the coalition government.</p>
<p>Romania's new leaders say seven months in office after seven years of go-slow reforms under ex-communists were too short to bridge the gap with more advanced neighbours.</p>
<p>Constantinescu said NATO leaders in Madrid had assured him that Romania and Slovenia, were &quot;certain candidates&quot; for admission next time. But Romania had to press on with its newly-launched market reforms.</p>
