<p>Greece's notorious November 17 urban guerrilla group have once again eluded police after shooting dead shipowner Constantine Peratikos and fleeing in a hijacked taxi, police officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately we don't have much evidence to work on. We are stripping down the two cars the guerrillas left behind but this looks like another classic November 17 attack, well planned and executed,&quot; a senior police officer told Reuters.</p>
<p>Peratikos, 42, was ambushed on Wednesday afternoon in Piraeus, Greece's main port near Athens, as he was heading for a garage to get his car.</p>
<p>Police said that ballistic tests of the bullets found at the site showed the pistol was the same used by November 17 in 11 attacks since it emerged in 1975. Hospital officials said Peratikos was shot seven times.</p>
<p>The group has yet to claim responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>November 17 guerrillas have killed 21 Greeks and foreigners -- including a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency station chief and a U.S. military attache.</p>
<p>&quot;When their stolen van failed to start, the three gunmen hijacked a taxi and then used another stolen car to flee. They often shot in the air to scare off pedestrians and drivers,&quot; the police officer said.</p>
<p>Peratikos' shooting may have signalled the the re-emergence of the group which had been dormant since a bungled rocket attack on the U.S. embassy in January 1996.</p>
<p>Police found .45 calibre shells at the site of the shooting. November 17 uses a trademark .45 calibre pistol as a signature to many of its attacks and is also versed in remote-controlled bombs and rockets.</p>
<p>November 17's last fatal attack was against Turkish embassy Counsellor Omer Haluk Sipahioglu, who was shot by a three-man hit squad outside his home in June 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an extremely sad event. I express my sorrow and am awaiting a detailed report from the Public Order minister,&quot; said Prime Minister Costas Simitis, referring to the latest attack.</p>
<p>The group named itself after the day in 1973 when Greece's then-ruling military junta used tanks to put down a student uprising.</p>
<p>The Peratikos Group, owned by one of Greece's major shipping families, bought the troubled Elefsis Shipyards in the early 1990s. But the shipyards have since reverted to state hands.</p>
<p>November 17 had made reference to the Peratikos Group in 1992 when it claimed responsibility for the shooting of a parliament deputy.</p>
<p>It accused the then conservative government of selling off state enterprises at very cheap prices.</p>
<p>The Peratikos family own the Piraeus-based Aran Shipping and Trading company and the London-based Pegasus Ocean Services.</p>
