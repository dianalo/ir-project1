<p>Indonesia is likely to announce a package of economic deregulation measures on Friday, government sources said.</p>
<p>Sources in the presidential palace said President Suharto was scheduled to meet Coordinating Minister for Economics and Finance Saleh Affif later in the morning along with other economic ministers.</p>
<p>Sources in the finance ministry said the long-delayed deregulation package was complete and would be on the agenda. Barring any last minute hitches, the measures should be announced later in the day, they said.  </p>
<p>The package was previously scheduled for last month but Affif was quoted as saying on June 20 there were some differences of opinion among ministers involved in drawing up the measures. On June 25, State Secretary Murdiono said the package was at the final stage, indicating the differences had been resolved.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government routinely unveils measures aimed at bolstering economic growth ahead of the meeting of the Consultative Group on Indonesia, a grouping of donor nations and financial institutions led by the World Bank.</p>
<p>The group is to meet later this month in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The World Bank, in its latest report on Indonesia, said that Indonesia's deregulation programme was losing momentum and that this could affect the health of its economy.</p>
