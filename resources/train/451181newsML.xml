<p>The European steel industry could be headed for a wave of consolidation if Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp is successful in its takeover of German rival Thyssen AG, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The takeover, which Thyssen planned to fight, would produce a giant that rivals Europe's top heavyweight, France's state-owned Usinor Sacilor, and increase pressure on others to merge, streamline and strengthen, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Steel companies have remained nationalistic, more so than chemical companies, and there could be more cross-border tie-ups,&quot; said Merrill Lynch steel analyst Alan Coats in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The heart of the European steel industry is in Germany, with the most consumption, and the most suppliers,&quot; Coats said. &quot;If Germany restructures, and the trend becomes more European, European steel makers will be more able to move into global thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said the European steel industry has too many small players and needs to consolidate to reduce overcapcity problems and improve profit.</p>
<p>Together, Krupp-Thyssen would account for 75 percent of German steel production, with particular strength in flat steel, and could realise tremendous savings in capital expenses and other costs, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The two companies have combined about 195,000 employees, and some would have to go,&quot; said Terance Sinclair at Salomon borthers in London. &quot;If they got rid of five percent they could double their margins. They could easily get rid of 10,000 to 20,000, but the final number is anybody's guess.&quot;</p>
<p>A new, competitive German giant would raise the stakes on others to merge, possibly a takeover of Spain's state-owned Cia. Siderurgica Integral by Usinor Sacilor, analysts said.</p>
<p>Other possibile merger candidates would include Arbed SA of Luxembourg and Belgium's Cockerill-Sambre SA.</p>
