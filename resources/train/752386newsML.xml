<p>Embattled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has streamlined his cabinet, axeing three ministries and merging others in what officials said was an attempt to cut back state spending as demanded by aid donors.</p>
<p>The reshuffle, announced hours before Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa presents Zimbabwe's 1997/98 budget, was said by his officials to be a demonstration that Mugabe's cash-strapped government was now trying to cut its high expenditure.</p>
<p>The World Bank and the IMF have been pressing the government to chop back state spending, which currently accounts for about 38 percent of gross domestic product and is seen by many as supporting a political patronage system, to qualify for new aid.</p>
<p>In a statement published on Thursday, Mugabe -- whose government is engulfed by several scandals -- said he had merged the key ministries of lands and agriculture and brought them under the control of lands minister Kumbirai Kangai.</p>
<p>He also merged the ministries of mines and environment and tourism and assigned transport and energy minister Simon Moyo to the new ministry.</p>
<p>Mugabe, who has retained most of his cabinet colleagues since he assumed power 17 years ago, moved Enos Chikowore from public construction and national housing to transport and energy.</p>
<p>Chikowore has been enmeshed in controversy over allegations that his housing ministry allowed a housing fund meant to benefit the homeless to be abused by top state officials, including cabinet ministers, to build luxury mansions.</p>
<p>A high court judge has advised the government to investigate the charges, which Chikowore has dismissed.</p>
<p>Joyce Mujuru, another controversial official, has been reassigned from the ministry of information, posts and telecommunications to a new ministry, rural resources and water development.</p>
<p>At information she was at the centre of allegations this year that she manipulated the government tender board to deny a licence to a private Zimbabwean company that has been battling the government in the courts for more than three years to win the right to operate a private cellular phone system.</p>
<p>Mujuru rejects the allegations and charges that she was instrumental in ensuring that the tender was won by a company in which President Mugabe's nephew, Leo Mugabe, is a shareholder.</p>
<p>The losing company has taken the issue to court.</p>
<p>Some of President Mugabe's top officials have been demanding the sacking of Mujuru, whose husband Solomon is the former army commander and currently a member of the ruling ZANU-PF's inner politburo, for accusing vice-president Joshua Nkomo of being senile.</p>
<p>Mugabe cut his ministries to 18 from 21, leaving untouched key ministries such as finance, industry and commerce, state security and defence.</p>
