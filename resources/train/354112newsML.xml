<p>Israeli shares closed lower on Tuesday in extremely volatile trading led by a decline in Maof shares, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares ended 0.93 percent, or 2.38 points, lower at 253.66 on very high all-share turnover of 252 million shekels against 260 million shekels on Monday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 1.65 percent lower at 261.24.</p>
<p>&quot;The session opened with nice gains and the indices rose by more than 2.5 percent. By midday the trend changed and the market started falling with the Maof plunging three percent,&quot; said Ari Eidelheit of Zeller Eblagon Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Just before the end of the trading day the market started rising again, closing with only a relatively moderate decline,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>At its peak, the Mishtanim index rose above its previous all-time high of 258.44 points but it subsequently fell back.</p>
<p>Traders said the sharp decline started with aggressive selling by Maof options speculators that was followed by profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was showing its strength today and it passed the test successfully. We may see some more profit-taking on Wednesday but the trend is very positive,&quot; said Eli Nahum, head of trading at Zannex Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The correction is very good for the market and I believe that the market will not fall below 250 before it starts rising again,&quot; Eidelheit said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many investors used the opportunity to buy shares. Even option prices, which reflected pessimism until last week, reflect hopes for a continued rise,&quot; Nahum added.</p>
<p>The most active share was Koor Industries, which lost 0.75 percent to 33,960 agorot on volume of 13.9 million shekels.</p>
<p>Bezeq Israel Telecom, the second active share, was also one of the most volatile shares today. Bezeq opened with a rise of two percent but by midday it plunged seven percent only to close with a decline of only two percent to 931 agorot on turnover of 8.4 million shekels.</p>
<p>Bank Hapoalim fell 1.0 percent to 642 on volume of 8.2 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.32 shekels)</p>
