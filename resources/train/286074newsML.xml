<title>BELGIUM: BELGIAN BELGACOM MOBILE TO APPEAL COURT RULING.</title>
<headline>BELGIAN BELGACOM MOBILE TO APPEAL COURT RULING.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-01-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Belgacom Mobile, which operates Belgium's Proximus mobile phone service, said on Friday it would appeal against a court ruling which said it must suspend a planned January sales promotion.</p>
<p>In a statement Belgacom Mobile said a Brussels court decided on Thursday provisionally to ban its Proximus promotion planned for this month following a complaint by rival GSM mobile phone network operator, Belgian-French company Mobistar.</p>
<p>&quot;Belgacom Mobile/Proximus will appeal against this decision,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there would be no publicity about its sales and it had asked its distributors to stop the sales programme.</p>
<p>Belgacom Mobile spokesman Luc De Groote said the court was applying the letter of the law which said companies could sell at a loss only directly to customers and not to distributors.</p>
<p>&quot;(We) believe the legal provisions...do not benefit either the consumer or distributors,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of Belgacom Mobile/Proximus is and will always be to make the market accessible to consumers by having yet more attractive prices.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Belgacom Mobile/Proximus deplore having to stop their sales action. The consumer may feel duped,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The statement said Belgacom Mobile clients currently totalled 409,000 - more than had been its target for 1996 - with 44,000 new clients having signed up in December.</p>
<p>Belgacom Mobile is a 75/25 venture between state telephone company Belgacom SA and AirTouch Communications Inc of the United States, which launched Proximus in January 1994.</p>
<p>Belgacom is 49.9 percent owned by a consortium including Ameritech ,Singapore Telecom and Tele Danmark and three Belgian groups. The rest is state owned.</p>
<p>Mobistar, which became operational in mid-1996, is owned 62 percent by France Telecom. Belgian data communications firm Telinfo NV has 10 percent and a group of eight other Belgian investors has the remaining 28 percent.</p>
