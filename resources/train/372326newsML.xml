<title>SINGAPORE: Asia Gas Oil/Jet - Swaps drive jet sharply lower.</title>

<p>Singapore jet fuel prices slumped on sharply lower swap offers in the absence of physical trade while gas oil drifted in a directionless market, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jet fuel prices collapsed on strong selling in the swaps market where the February regrade (jet fuel/gas oil swaps spread) was offered down to $3.40 per barrel against Tuesday's $4.30/$4.70.</p>
<p>No physical bids or offers were heard on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, a bid was heard for 100,000 barrels at $30.10 a barrel for Feb 26-Mar 2 lifting fob, about 90 cents below last Thursday's buying number.</p>
<p>Traders said the lower swaps prices were indicative of the bearish market, where most consumers have covered their winter requirement.</p>
<p>Jet fuel supplies are tight in Singapore due to earlier committments but because there is no fresh buying the market was sold down, traders said.  </p>
<p>Japan earlier bought two cargoes from South Korea at around $2.20 per barrel over Singapore spot quotes on a cost-and-freight basis, in line with recent trades.</p>
<p>Gas oil drifted sideways as the market was weighed down by offers from one local trader despite indications of fresh demand from India and China.</p>
<p>The local trader has  sold a total of seven 150,000-190,000-barrel cargoes since mid-January.</p>
<p>The trader had earlier imported 440,000-tonnes of gas oil from the Middle East for sale to China but Chinese buying has ground to a halt since mid-January.  </p>
<p>&quot;We bought the cargoes to sell to China but now we are stuck. We still have cargoes to sell,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>As a result of the traders' predicament, most players said it would be difficult for gas oil to rise substantially.</p>
<p>The Singapore gas oil market was boosted by news of a 50,000-tonne sale recently to a trader to cover committments to India--the first time in months that cargoes from Singapore were used to cover Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) monthly requirement.</p>
<p>Also China had put out feelers to buy cargoes for late February and March arrival.  </p>
<p>The trader today offered a 150,000-barrel cargo at $25.30 per barrel for Feb 27-Mar 3 lifting fob, 20 cents above Tuesday's traded level.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps were steady throughout the day at $25.30/$25.50 per barrel, largely unchanged from Tuesday's $25.45/$25.55.</p>
