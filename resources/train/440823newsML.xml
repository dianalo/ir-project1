<p>Two of Northern Ireland's political leaders who are involved in the peace process said on Wednesday they regretted Irish President Mary Robinson's decision not to seek re-election.</p>
<p>&quot;She will be a tough act to follow,&quot; Belfast Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) councillor Alex Attwood said in an interview with Reuters before speaking at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.</p>
<p>&quot;She came in originally standing for equality for women and latterly it became standing for equality for everyone, the poor, community,&quot; added Attwood, whose party represents the moderate nationalist view in the Northern Ireland conflict.</p>
<p>Billy Hutchinson of the pro-British Progressive Unionist Party, who was also at the university to speak about Northern Ireland, said Robinson &quot;had an understanding ... that was more acceptable to the Unionists. But like Alex, I believe Ireland has changed so fundamentally, that it is more confident in its role in Europe and in its identity that somebody (like Robinson) will come forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Robinson, who announced earlier on Wednesday she would not seek re-election, had been suggested as a possible United Nations secretary-general and there was speculation in Ireland that she could be offered a top U.N. human rights post.</p>
