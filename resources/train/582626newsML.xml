<p>President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday a new agreement between former Cold War foes NATO and Russia was &quot;an historic step closer to a peaceful, undivided, democratic Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>He told reporters the deal reached in Moscow earlier in the day opened the way to the signing in Paris later this month of a new framework for Russia-NATO relations. The pact was drawn up partly to calm Russian concerns over the western alliance's expansion into the formerly communist east.</p>
<p>&quot;Today in Moscow we have taken an historic step closer to a peaceful, undivided, democratic Europe for the first time in history,&quot; Clinton said. The deal was finalised in Moscow between NATO and Russian negotiators, with considerable U.S. involvement.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia will work closely with NATO but not within NATO, giving Russia a voice in but not a veto over NATO's business,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While details of the pact were scarce, Clinton's comments appeared at odds with those of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who said in Moscow the deal would be binding on the western alliance and would give Moscow the means to block any decision by NATO of which it did not approve.</p>
<p>&quot;The binding nature of this document is for all to see, Yeltsin said. He added that &quot;decisions can be taken only by consensus ... If Russia is against some decision, it means this decision will not go through.&quot;</p>
<p>While Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and White House National Security Adviser Samuel Berger declined to call Yeltsin's interpretation wrong, both stressed that Russia did not and would not have a veto over NATO actions.</p>
<p>Albright said she believed Yeltsin was talking about the joint NATO-Russia permanent council created by the agreement which would &quot;operate by consensus.&quot;</p>
<p>But she explained that Russia would have no voice in the North Atlantic Council, the 16-member body that sets NATO policy, describing the council as &quot;sacrosanct.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Russia does not and will not have a veto over any action in NATO itself,&quot; Albright said on the PBS television programme &quot;Newshour With Jim Lehrer.&quot;</p>
<p>Berger agreed, saying the pact made clear that Russia did not have a veto over NATO decisions.</p>
<p>&quot;The document speaks for itself and as it is released you can see there is no veto,&quot; he said in a CNN television interview.</p>
<p>Russia strongly opposes the expansion of the western alliance into former communist states once allied with Moscow. But with NATO planning to go ahead and name new members in July, Moscow has sought an agreement that goes as far as possible to protect its interests.</p>
<p>Clinton said under the deal reached in Moscow it was made clear that NATO's mission &quot;is not to threaten, confine or in any way undermine Russia.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;What the language does is to make it clear that there are no plans, and there are no reasons to in effect activate old Warsaw pact military installations for what you might call traditional NATO aggressive forward posturing.&quot;</p>
<p>The deal gives Russia a &quot;practical partnership&quot; with NATO, Clinton said, that will let the alliance &quot;work to prevent a return to national rivalries, to defeat new threats to peace and freedom and prosperity&quot; like those that tore Europe assumder for much of the 20th Century.</p>
<p>A breakthrough was blocked until now by a row over whether the pact should include written guarantees that NATO will not station military structures and nuclear arms on the territory of new member states. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been reluctant to give such guarantees in writing.</p>
<p>On this point, Clinton said: &quot;There is an explicit understanding in the agreement that we will have to use some infrastructure for the agreed upon operations that are an integral part of being a NATO member.&quot;</p>
<p>Leaders of NATO's 16 countries meet in Madrid on July 8-9 to decide the alliance's first new members of the post-Cold War era. Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic are considered certain but Romania and Slovenia are also being discussed.</p>
<p>Clinton said Wednesday NATO's doors &quot;will remain open to all those ready to shoulder the burdens of membership.  The first new members will not be the last.&quot;</p>
