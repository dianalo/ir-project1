<p>Wall Street shares are expected to open mixed and mostly unchanged on Monday, hoping bond yields stay below seven percent and awaiting various economic data due out this week, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market will be awaiting personal income and consumption data today, but bonds will call the tune,&quot; Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co, said.</p>
<p>On Friday, U.S. blue chips closed nearly unchanged after climbing back from a steep decline sparked by a profit warning from Intel Corp.  </p>
<p>The bond market gave an added boost to stocks, especially the shares of banks and financial companies, by rising 27/32 on Friday to push a key yield to 6.91 percent.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury was up 3/32 on Monday at a 6.90 percent yield, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures index was up one point at 851.60.</p>
<p>Inflation-wary bonds will watch personal income and consumption data, due out at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT, analysts said.</p>
<p>Both are expected to be flat in April versus respective 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent gains last month.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is the first second quarter number on consumption,&quot; Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics said.  &quot;Personal income could surprise on the downside because of the floods and all the property destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>Other data due out this morning included the National Association of Purchasing Managers Index, due out at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT.  It was forecast at 53.9 in May, versus a reading of 54.2 in the previous month.</p>
<p>&quot;This will tell us something about the manufacturing sector, but for the broader economy, the question is really demand and where demand is going,&quot; Ellis said.  </p>
<p>The dollar was off against earlier highs against the yen in Tokyo, trading at 116.13/23 yen. In Europe, the dollar was buoyant against the mark, trading at 1.7275/80 marks.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column reported that Citicorp, the second largest bank in the United States, is showing signs it might be ready to make acquisitions, after remaining on the sidelines for a while.</p>
<p>The New York Times said in its News Analysis column that lawmakers and lobbyists nearly all said a merger deal between AT&amp;T Corp and SBC Communications Inc would probably never clear regulatory hurdles.</p>
