<p>Albanian rebels holding this Adriatic port added Rome to their list of enemies on Monday after a crowded refugee boat intercepted by the Italian navy sank last week.</p>
<p>The sudden rush of hatred toward Rome comes just ahead of the planned deployment of an Italian-led multinational security force in Albania to protect humanitarian relief supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;We want no Italians in this town. We lost our families,&quot; said Gjergji Greni, 34. &quot;If we see Italian soldiers in Vlore now, we'll all go crazy. We have a common blood here.&quot;</p>
<p>He was speaking at a rally by some 4,000 people to mourn the dead -- more than 80 according to Albania -- in the boat sinking on Friday. Residents also fired thousands of rounds from an array of looted army weapons and threw flowers into the sea to honour the dead.</p>
<p>A stolen Albanian patrol boat was packed with more than 100 refugees when it collided with the Italian ship and sank. The Italian navy was enforcing its orders to turn back refugees fleeing from Albania.</p>
<p>The dead included many women and children from Vlore. Thirty-four people were rescued.</p>
<p>Residents and the rebel council, which has defied President Sali Berisha for almost two months, hold Rome responsible for the deaths because of its policy of forcing back refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;As a military man, I can tell you that it would be a big mistake to deploy Italians in this town. No one would receive them with flowers,&quot; said Simon Malushi, a former army officer.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to kill anyone but the situation here is out of control and people are crazy with anger at the Italians over what happened,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Council leader Albert Shyti told the rally Italy must admit responsibility, punish the guilty and compensate families of victims and &quot;only then will Italians be accepted in our town&quot;.</p>
<p>Italy has blamed the accident on erratic manoeuvres by the Albanian captain but no one in Vlore seems to question who was responsible.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt the refugee ship was sunk intentionally. It was a deal between Berisha and Italy to use all means to stop the Albanian exodus, even sinking ships,&quot; said Dilaver Alia, a member of Vlore council.</p>
<p>Since the start of the rebellion in February, Berisha has been public enemy number one in Vlore, where Albania declared independence from Turkish Ottoman rule in 1912. Now Rome has been added to the list.</p>
<p>The region remains defiantly outside of government control and the port has been closed, except to illegal refugee boats, since the insurrection began.</p>
<p>Food and medicine are running low. No one has been paid or received pensions in three months. There is no work and nothing to do but play bingo or flee the lawless country to Italy.</p>
<p>More than 13,000 Albanians have fled to Italy this month and men at Monday's rally said despite the boat sinking they had no choice but to pay $500 to travel illegally to Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have nothing. No work, no money, no pension and no choice but to head for Italy or Greece,&quot; said Kristi Vero, 50.</p>
<p>Both Italy and Greece, Albania's southern neighbour, fear the turmoil in the country could trigger a mass exodus similar to 1991 and 1992 following the collapse of 45 years of ruthless Stalinist rule.</p>
<p>Rome has pushed hard for the multinational security force -- including France, Greece and Romania among others. It won U.N. backing last week and plans to deploy the force soon.</p>
<p>Italy and Greece hope the force will help stabilise Albania ahead of early June elections which, hopefully, will lead to a political solution to the crisis. But now Rome and Berisha have become intertwined as two similar evils in Vlore minds.</p>
<p>&quot;Let Berisha keep the Italian assistance. We don't want Italian sugar. It isn't sweet anymore,&quot; said Malushi.</p>
