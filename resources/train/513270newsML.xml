<p>Visiting U.S. trade negotiators said on Wednesday they were expecting a copyright agreement with Vietnam to be concluded within the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>Joseph Damond, chief negotiator with the U.S. mission, told reporters at a news briefing that significant progress had been achieved during talks with Vietnamese officials this week and said a result was expected to be announced soon.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have made great progress on that agreement with the Vietnamese side,&quot; he said. &quot;We are very near being able to make an announcement on those negotiations.... There's a social event tonight... and we hope to put the issue to rest at that time.&quot;</p>
<p>Damond said the next stage would be for the United States and Vietnam to work out details of implementation and enforcement, but said the existance of an accord would help in the process of work towards a bilateral trade agreement.</p>
<p>Hanoi and Washington normalised diplomatic ties in 1995, but progress towards a full trade agreement has so far been slow.</p>
<p>Damond described the expected copyright agrement as &quot;a good start&quot; in that process, but gave no date for likely full economic normalisation.</p>
