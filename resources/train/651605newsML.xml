<p>Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) said on Tuesday it would cut the coupon rate for its June five-year bank debentures to 2.75 percent from 2.95 percent for its May debentures.</p>
<p>The bank also said it would cut is June long-term prime lending rate to 2.9 percent, down 0.2 percentage point from May.  </p>
<p>The new long-term prime rate will go into effect on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The prime rate, which is applied to loans of one year or more to Japanese long-term credit banks' most creditworthy clients, is reviewed every month, reflecting market trends.</p>
<p>The prime rate, which is also a key reference rate for other banks making long-term loans, was raised by 0.6 point to 3.1 percent in May due to a surge in long-term bond yields in reaction to firmness in Tokyo stocks.</p>
<p>The long-term credit banks customarily set their prime rates 0.9 percentage point above the coupon rate of the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd's (IBJ) five-year debenture, issued monthly.</p>
<p>The IBJ debenture is the benchmark for Japan's debenture market. Bank debentures are the long-term credit banks' major fund-raising tool.</p>
<p>IBJ said on Monday it would cut its long-term prime lending rate for June to 2.9 percent from 3.1 percent in May. It also said it would cut the coupon rate for its June debentures to two percent from 2.2 percent in May.</p>
