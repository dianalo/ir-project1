<title>FRANCE: FRENCH WHEAT BIDS INCLUDE 85,000 TONNES AT TAX.</title>
<headline>FRENCH WHEAT BIDS INCLUDE 85,000 TONNES AT TAX.</headline>

<p>Thursday's French soft wheat bids include 85,000 tonnes for which shippers have offered to pay export taxes, grain traders said.</p>
<p>Of this, 10,000 tonnes is at the highest world price level of 1.50 Ecus per tonne.  </p>
<p>Cereals office ONIC earlier said traders had bid for 378,500 tonnes of soft wheat with both taxes and refunds, but did not give a volume breakdown between the two categories.</p>
<p>It said the range of tax offers was 0.10 Ecus to 1.50 Ecus and the range of refund bids was zero Ecus to 1.97 Ecus a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said more than half the total sought -- around 200,000 tonnes -- appeared to be at a zero refund.</p>
<p>Because of rule differences between taxes and subsidies, a zero refund with storage relief becomes a one Ecu refund in September. It increases by another one Ecu a month until reaching four Ecus in December, the latest valid month.</p>
<p>Taxes do not benefit from these monthly storage adjustments.</p>
<p>Traders said the cumulative volume of bids (including taxes) up to and including a refund of one Ecu was 372,500 tonnes.</p>
<p>Taking off the tax and zero-refund tonnages, this implies some 87,500 tonnes of bids between refunds of zero and one Ecu.</p>
<p>A tax of 1.50 Ecus appeared to value French wheat around $149 per tonne for September shipment. A zero refund with one monthly increment for September would lower this to $146.</p>
<p>Competing soft red winter wheat is quoted at $141-142.</p>
<p>EU export licences are valid for the month in which they are issued, plus four further months. Refunds, even those which start out at zero, are increased by one Ecu a month starting from the month after the period in which they were obtained.</p>
<p>The EU's cereals management committee meets in Brussels later on Thursday to review the bids.</p>
<p>The EU recently changed its rules to allow the Commission to issue both refunds and taxes at the same export tender. The previous system had been criticised for allowing traders to block all subsidy awards to their rivals by putting in a single offer to pay tax on a low tonnage.</p>
<p>However, because of the expanding difference between a zero refund and the cheapest tax offer -- reaching 3.9 Ecus in December -- any subsidy awards are unlikely today, traders said.</p>
<p>That left the prospect of modest exports of some 85,000 tonnes with taxes to cover current needs, plus whatever was sought in other countries. One trader, however, thought the Commission would simply pass this week.</p>
