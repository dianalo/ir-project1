<p>House of Representatives Democrats may try to delay a vote on re-electing Newt Gingrich as speaker on Tuesday until the Ethics Committee finishes its work on charges against him in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The House was scheduled to vote for speaker later on Tuesday.  House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, speaking to reporters after a closed-door meeting, said Democrats were exploring whether a procedural motion to delay the vote was possible.  </p>
<p>&quot;We may move to postpone this vote until the ethics process is finished with the speaker. A number of us believe that would be the best thing to do,&quot; Gephardt said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not trying and never have tried to get a Democrat to be speaker. We did not win the election, that is not our purpose,&quot; he said, adding that Democrats wanted someone in the speaker's chair &quot;who brings credit to the office.&quot;</p>
<p>Gephardt said he did not know whether any Republicans -- who hold a 227 to 207 majority in the House with one independent who usually votes with the Democrats -- would support a move to delay the vote.</p>
<p>The re-election of Gingrich has been thrown into doubt because he face probable discipline for admitted breaches of House ethics rules.</p>
