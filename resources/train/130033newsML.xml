<title>UK: Grain prices extend their decline.</title>

<p>Benchmark Chicago wheat prices opened the week hovering around $4.0 per bushel as the U.S. market eased again following a sharp drop in European grain prices. Declines follow bumper harvests after a run-up in prices earlier this year that saw Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) nearby wheat futures hit a record $7.50. A Chicago price at $4 per bushel, not seen since June 1995, equates to $159 per tonne paid by wheat importers, compared with $300 in April of this year.</p>
<p>Markets had been panicked then by a drop in world stocks to 20-year lows following drought in Australia, North Africa and Russia. But exporters are now having to compete again to sell grain as this year has brought big crops in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in commodity markets crude oil prices stayed firm on strong pre-winter demand for heating fuel in the northern hemisphere at around $24.50 for a barrel of the benchmark North Sea Brent Blend.</p>
<p>Gold firmed to a London close at $381.75, up from Friday's $379.11 per ounce, on what dealers said was some speculative fund interest in reaction to an easier start on Wall Street equities. Among industrial metals London Metal Exchange (LME) copper made what traders called a constructive afternoon close above $1,950 per tonne on expectations that data on Tuesday will show a continuing drop in warehouse stocks of the metal.</p>
<p>Lead edged higher after a fall on Friday to the year's lowest levels in a sell-off that reflected big deliveries from China and sluggish demand for auto batteries. London Metal Exchange (LME) three-months delivery lead was up about $10 above Friday's low $715 per tonne.</p>
<p>Coffee prices extended a decline and London January Robusta type futures ended down $10 at $1,387 although above day's lows. Bullish crop news from Central America where Hurricane Lili has pounded many farm lands went largely ignored by traders who said the extent of the damage to coffee was overstated.</p>
