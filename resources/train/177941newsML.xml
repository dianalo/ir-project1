<p>Iran signed a 3,200 billion rial ($1.07 billion) deal with an Italian firm on Saturday to set up two new steel plants and boost production in two others, state-run Tehran radio said.</p>
<p>The radio said the Italian company, which it did not name, would help set up two new plants with a total annual capacity of 1.1 milion tonnes in Khorasan province in northeastern Iran and East Azerbaijan province in the northwest.</p>
<p>The funding for the contract, signed for Iran by the state National Iranian Steel Company, included $561 million in long-term credits, it said.</p>
<p>London-based Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) said in October Iran had activated a $561 million syndicated loan arranged by European and Japanese banks for a contract by Italy's Danieli &amp; Co to work on four steel projects in Iran.</p>
<p>Tehran radio said the contract also included raising annual production to 2.35 million tonnes each at two steel mills in central Isfahan province and southwestern Khuzestan. It did not give further details.</p>
<p>Iran has said steel production would reach six million tonnes in the Iranian year ending on March 20, 1997, up from 4.3 million tonnes last year. ($1=3,000 rials at the official exchange rate)</p>
