<p>The European Union, angry at being shut out of an Arab-Israeli peace summit called by the United States, invited Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Monday to meet its foreign ministers before he goes to Washington.</p>
<p>Despite intensive French efforts to win bigger a Middle East role, President Bill Clinton excluded the Europeans from the summit line-up when he asked leaders of Israel, the PLO, Egypt and Jordan to Washington after a wave of violence sparked by the opening of an Israeli tunnel in the Arab Old City of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The snub irritated some European governments, who are the main paymasters of the U.S.-dominated peace process but have been denied a high-profile political role ever since the 1991 Madrid peace conference which launched it.</p>
<p>EU and PLO officials said Arafat, who has asked Clinton to delay the summit, would meet the so-called troika of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday night. The troika comprises the past, present and next holders of the EU's rotating presidency -- Italy, Ireland and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minister Herve de Charette would meet Arafat in Luxembourg on Tuesday, the day the Washington summit is due to start.</p>
<p>De Charette vented frustration in a radio interview on Sunday at Europe's exclusion from the Washington summit.</p>
<p>&quot;That is certainly unfortunate,&quot; he said. &quot;That is certainly not a positive step for things to go forward.&quot;</p>
<p>But not everyone shared French pique. British officials said Washington had co-ordinated closely with the Europeans, even if the EU was not at the table.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the prospect of the summit. It seems perfectly sensible that it should be held under the auspices of the United States,&quot; a British Foreign Office spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said the Washington meeting would be only &quot;a curtainraiser for negotiations that will take place in the Middle East under the auspices of (Egyptian) President Hosni Mubarak&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is regrettable that we will not be there for the curtain raising. The European Union has its place in the peace process. It is bound to be part of a peace settlement because it finances 75 percent of aid to the Palestinian territories,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Arafat and Mubarak had sought to include France or the EU's Irish presidency in the summit line-up but had met with a flat refusal of the United States and Israel.</p>
<p>The three major EU powers, France, Britain and Germany, made an unprecedented joint appeal to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat last Friday to resume top-level peace negotiations immediately.</p>
<p>Unlike the United States, which has refrained from public criticism of the Jewish state, they called for the closure of the Israeli tunnel which triggered last week's violence.</p>
<p>It was the first such joint foreign policy inititive by the &quot;Big Three&quot;, and was aimed was at maximising European influence and respond to complaints that the EU is too slow and powerless in reacting to crises close to its borders.</p>
<p>Leading German Middle East expert Professor Udo Steinbach of the German Institute for Oriental Studies in Hamburg, said it a matter of regret that Europe was not represented at the summit since &quot;Europe pays the lion's share of aid to the Palestinians&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the Europeans partly had themselves to blame, since they had &quot;repeatedly missed the chance to show enough profile in the Middle East&quot;. France, the most active European power in the region, often appeared to act in its own rather than collective European interests, he said.</p>
<p>European resentment is fuelled by a feeling that Washington is not an entirely honest broker because it is biased towards Israel, especially in a U.S. presidential election year.</p>
