<p>Foreign miners are still keen on investing in Argentina's mining sector despite falling or stagnant world metal prices, Argentina's Under-Secretary for Mining Daniel Meilan said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At a seminar on Argentina's mining sector, he forecast that exploration spending in the country would rise to $160 million in 1999 from $100 million in 1996.</p>
<p>He added that during the 1996 to 2000 period total exploration spending in Argentina was expected to surpass Chile, a key target of foreign mining investment in recent years, and would be exceeded in Latin America only by Peru.</p>
<p>He also projected the value of Argentina's mine output would reach $1.74 billion by 2000 compared with $510 million in 1996, while exports would climb to $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>He rejected suggestions that this summer's tumble in copper prices and stagnant gold prices may dampen interest in Argentina's mining sector, noting that representatives from three South African mining companies were in Argentina last week to discuss investment opportunities.  </p>
<p>Some mining industry analysts and executives have argued that artificially high copper prices in recent years encouraged too many mining projects around the world and some may have to be scrapped after prices slid to 2-1/2-year lows this summer.</p>
<p>Several large copper and gold projects are currently under construction or being studied in Argentina, including the Alumbrera deposit which is expected to yield 180,000 tonnes of copper and 640,000 ounces of gold per year after it begins operation in 1997. Australia's MIM Holdings Ltd holds a 50 percent share of Alumbrera.</p>
<p>Meilan also noted that four or five companies had indicated an interest in a possible copper smelter project in Argentina, including Outokumpu Oy, Phelps Dodge Corp, Mitsui &amp; Co and Mitsubishi Corp, although it was still too early to say if such a project would be feasible.</p>
<p>He said Alumbrera's output alone would not justify a smelter in Argentina, although if additional copper projects, such as the Agua Rica copper-gold deposit being explored by a venture including Australian mining giant BHP Co, come on stream, a smelter project may be worthwhile.</p>
