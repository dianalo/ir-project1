<p>Excluding one-time charges, net income at Edison Mission Energy (EME) increased to $18.6 million for the quarter from $15.5 million for the same quarter last year, reflecting improved operating performance.</p>
<p>The one-time adjustments for 1997 include a gain of $14.0 million, or three cents per share, attributable to the sale of EME's ownership interest in B.C. Star, a collection of oil and gas properties.  This gain was off-set by a charge of $13.1 million, or three cents per share, related to the refinancing of debt at the Loy Yang B project in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining 49% interest in the project.</p>
<p>The debt refinancing resulted in the immediate recognition of previously deferred debt financing costs.  Edison Capital's (EC) quarterly net income increased by approximately $2 million, primarily due to its new investments in cross-border leases totaling approximately $300 million.</p>
<p>Start-up costs at Edison Enterprises were primarily responsible for a two- cents-per-share decrease in the second quarter of 1997 compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, Edison International earned 69 cents per share compared to 73 cents per share last year.  On an operating basis, excluding one-time adjustments, Edison International earned 69 cents compared to 77 cents per share for the same period last year.</p>
<p>For the 12-month period ending June 30, 1997, Edison International's earnings per share were $1.60 compared to $1.69 for the same period last year. On an operating basis, excluding one-time adjustments, earnings were $1.62 per share compared to $1.74.</p>
<p>SCE's operating earnings declined primarily due to extended outages at SONGS and the lower return on the nuclear units.  These impacts were partially offset by improved overall operating performance at the utility and higher sales.</p>
<p>Excluding one-time adjustments, the earnings of EME, EC and Mission Land Company (MLC), as a group, increased, primarily due to higher earnings from EME's foreign projects, led by First Hydro, which benefited from the effects of higher energy sales and increased utilization, and EC's new cross-border leases.</p>
