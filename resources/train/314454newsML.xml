<p>Britain-based trainer David Nicholson said on Friday he will be double-handed in his bid to land the Group One Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown on Sunday.</p>
<p>Nicholson said he will be represented by Zabadi (3-1) and Escartefigue (7-2) in Sunday's 50,000 Irish pounds ($81,830) two-mile presentation.</p>
<p>&quot;David Bridgewater will ride Escartefigue while Adrian (Maguire) will be on Zabadi,&quot; Nicholson said.</p>
<p>Zabadi was seventh in the 1996 Triumph Hurdle at Cheltenham, a race in which Escartefigue was fourth behind the victorious Paddy's Return.</p>
<p>Ireland's Aidan O'Brien and Noel Meade will also both have two runners in the race while Paddy Mullins-trained Notcompainingbut (20-1) will make up the seven runner field.</p>
<p>Champion Irish national hunt jockey, Charlie Swan, will ride Theatreworld (5-2 favourite) and Richard Dunwoody will team up with 1996 Aintree Hurdle winner Urubande (4-1) for O'Brien.</p>
<p>Richard Hughes will partner Cockney Lad (8-1) while Paul Carberry will ride Dardjini (12-1) for Meade.</p>
<p>Collier Bay, winner of the race in 1996, did not travel to Ireland on Friday. Wiltshire-based trainer Jim Old said his stable-star had been held up in his work at home due to the big-freeze in Britain and was not fit enough to try and regain his crown.</p>
