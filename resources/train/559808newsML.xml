<p>People trying to quit smoking who want an alternative to nicotine patches and chewing gum could use an inhalable alternative that uses typical smoker's behaviour, health officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved the Nicotrol Inhaler, a nicotine inhalation system for prescription use.</p>
<p>The person trying to quit gets the nicotine replacement therapy by inhaling through a cartridge placed in a mouthpiece.</p>
<p>Advanced Therapeutic Products Inc., which developed the device, said it is the first form of nicotine replacement therapy to help control a smoker's craving for cigarettes but also provide one of the behavioural patterns that goes with smoking, the hand-to-mouth ritual.</p>
<p>The FDA said it is not known if the product satisfies that psychological need for the hand-mouth ritual. But clinical trials have shown that the quit rates were comparable to other smoking cessation products on the market.</p>
<p>Some of the alternative methods are sold over-the-counter but the Inhaler will be available by prescription.</p>
<p>In 1987, the company sold patented nicotine technology, which forms the basis of the Inhaler, to what is now Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn in exhange for future product payments equal to about three percent of net sales to wholesale distributors.</p>
<p>The Inhaler will be marketed in the U.S. as the Nicotrol Inhaler by McNeil Consumer Products, a Johnson &amp; Johnson company.</p>
<p>Outside the U.S.,the Inhaler is marketed by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn as the Nicorette Inhaler and is available over-the-counter in Denmark, Sweden and Italy, with applications pending for over-the-counter sales in five other countries including the United Kingdom.</p>
