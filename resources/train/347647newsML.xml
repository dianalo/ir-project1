<p>Alicia Munnell, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said Friday that that the jump in the Gross Domestic Product in the fourth quarter resulted in part from a surge in exports, but some overseas sales were &quot;one-shot&quot; affairs.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Munnell said that the consumer, who also helped buoy the fourth quarter activity, was the key to growth during 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;There were big items; they were airplanes and other sort of lumpy things that probably made the fourth quarter growth higher than you can expect on a steady basis,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>Looking for the source of economic strength in the first quarter and throughout 1997, Munnell said that the consumer held the key.</p>
<p>&quot;For that we really look to the consumer,&quot; she said.  &quot;The consumer is in remarkably good shape and we expect the consumer to be a major source throughout the 1997 period.&quot;</p>
