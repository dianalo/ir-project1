<p>Malaysia's stock market could see hefty gains in 1997, underpinned by political stability and a moderating economy, Malaysian fund managers predict.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no negative sentiments on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, there are not likely to be any major political events and the current account deficit is improving,&quot; said Nik Ezar Nik Bolia, chief executive of DCB-RHB Unit Trust Management Bhd.</p>
<p>Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 9.5 percent in 1995, raising market fears that the economy was overheating. An 18.7 billion ringgit ($7.42 billion) current account deficit in that year was also a major concern.</p>
<p>Since then, the government has lifted short-term interest rates and curbed spending. GDP growth, for example, is expected to moderate to a more manageable 8.2 percent for 1996.</p>
<p>Fund managers, including Nik Ezar, favour finance, infrastructure development and selected consumer stocks in the new year.</p>
<p>&quot;The finance sector should be good in 1997. We are anticipating a 150 basis point drop in interest rates over the next 12 months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This would make consumers likely to spend more on durable goods and invest more in property and the stock market, he said.</p>
<p>Nik Ezar, whose DCB-RHB manages around one billion ringgit in funds, expects the benchmark Composite Index to hit the 1,300 mark by the end of the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>The blue chip barometer, which gained 24 percent in 1996, closed Friday at 1,231.45, up a slight 0.92 points on the day.</p>
<p>DCB-RHB is a unit of financial and property group Rashid Hussain Bhd, whose funds are managed by Rashid Hussain Asset Management Sdn Bhd which oversees a total of 2.7 billion ringgit, making the asset management firm one of the largest privately-owned fund managers in the country.</p>
<p>Other fund managers are even more bullish, predicting the index will break its previous record of 1,332.04 set on January 5, 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;By December (1997) 1,350 to 1,400 on the Composite Index is not unreasonable,&quot; said Arnold Lim, general manager of HLG Asset Management, a unit of Malaysia's Hong Leong Group.</p>
<p>Lim expects the rally to be mainly fuelled by demand for infrastructure-related stocks. &quot;There will be a rush to complete many infrastructure projects before the 1998 Commonwealth Games (to be held in Kuala Lumpur),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nik Ezar said he anticipates more mergers and acquisitions within the banking industry, something the government has been encouraging to make Malaysian banks more competitive.</p>
<p>In the second half of 1996, several banks merged or were acquired by other financial institutions. Several more banks are rumoured to be considering such tie-ups.</p>
<p>The building supplies and construction industry is also likely to benefit from continued spending on basic infrastructure development within the country, said Nik Ezar.</p>
<p>Construction companies like Sungei Way Bhd, and Gamuda Bhd are among his favourites, he said.</p>
<p>Telecommunications stocks, particularly Technology Resources Industries Bhd (TRI) are also likely to be watched closely, he said. &quot;If it falls to four ringgit, it's a 'buy',&quot; he added, referring to Technology Resources.</p>
<p>The influence of foreign funds on the Malaysian market has always been significant due to its relatively small market capitalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;Some foreign funds are re-rating us. More European and U.S. funds are now looking at Malaysia differently, and between 1997 and 1998 there should be stronger interest here,&quot; said Pearlene Cheong, research manager of K.L. Mutual Fund.</p>
