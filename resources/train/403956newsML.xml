<p>Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on Wednesday named Ihor Mityukov, a former deputy prime minister (corrects) and currently envoy to the European Union, as finance minister, the presidential press office said.</p>
<p>At the same time Yuri Yekhanurov, Chairman of the State</p>
<p>Property Fund, was put in charge of the economy ministry to replace Vasyl Hureyev, who became minister for machine-building and the military complex, a statement said.</p>
<p>Analysts said  the moves were designed to protect Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko's position amid criticism of the government.</p>
<p>The previous finance minister, Valentyn Koronevsky, was dismissed by Kuchma on Tuesday for &quot;serious inadequacies in his work.&quot; Statistics minister Olexander Osaulenko was also sacked, accused of bad management.</p>
<p>The statement said outgoing machine-building minister Valery Maleyev was being moved to another post but did not say what his new job would be.</p>
<p>The changes were made against a background of economic troubles which have sparked criticism from across the political spectrum and brought miners, teachers and other workers on to the streets in protest in recent months.</p>
