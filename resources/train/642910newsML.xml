<p>A Brazilian consumer price and quality watchdog administered by the federal government was eliminated Friday, a Finance Ministry official said.</p>
<p>A decree published in the official Daily Gazette scrapped the National Supply Superintendency (Sunab) which was founded 35 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision was taken because we feel there is a sense of maturity in the marketplace nowadays,&quot; said Boliva Moura Rocha, economic monitoring secretary at the Finance Ministry. &quot;There is no more need for price controls.&quot;</p>
<p>In the days of high inflation, when the real value of goods was often hard to calculate, Sunab officials would make surprise swoops on supermarkets and other stores in an attempt to prevent sharp price increases.</p>
<p>Of its 1,100 staff, 283 were not formal federal employees and would be laid off. About a third of the rest were due for retirement and the remainder, whose jobs were protected by the constitution, would be found work elsewhere, Rocha said.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry would continue to monitor consumer prices on an ad hoc basis, he said.</p>
