<headline>Palestinians, Israelis clash over Jerusalem.</headline>

<p>Palestinians angered by Jewish settlement in Jerusalem threw petrol bombs and rocks at Israeli soldiers on Thursday in violence reminiscent of a six-year uprising ended by a peace deal now under fire.</p>
<p>Israeli troops responded with rubber bullets and teargas during clashes on the outskirts of Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem, southwest of Jerusalem. A hospital official said one protester was wounded and 14 were treated for teargas inhalation.</p>
<p>&quot;What is taken by force, can only be taken back by force,&quot; said one protester. Palestinians also clashed with the Israeli army at the village of Bet Immar near Hebron. Soldiers fired teargas but no injuries were immediately reported.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Dore Gold, an envoy from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, crossed paths in Cairo, the centre of Arab consultations on the crisis over Israel's plan to build 6,500 homes for Jews in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Officials said Arafat would see Hosni Mubarak, while Gold would have talks with the Egyptian president's foreign policy adviser, Osama el-Baz.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm here to convey a message from Israel to Egypt and we have a very new proposal about the peace process to discuss,&quot; Gold told reporters.</p>
<p>He was apparently referring to Netanyahu's offer to complete &quot;final status&quot; talks with the Palestinian Authority (PA) within six months, nearly two years earlier than planned.</p>
<p>The Palestinians have dismissed the plan as a trick. Netanyahu's communications director David Bar-Illan told Reuters Israel was hoping the PA would reexamine the proposal and change its stand.</p>
<p>In Helsinki, White House press secretary Mark McCurry said: &quot;If either side has a proposal to make then they should do so directly to their negotiating counterpart. That's the purpose of negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>McCurry, who is with President Bill Clinton for a two-day summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, said Netanyahu's offer to finish making peace in six months could have value.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said that moving to the final status negotiations and beginning to deal with what are the most troublesome aspects of negotiations that the two sides have would be useful because that is where the greatest difficulty lies in resolving the differences that exist,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said the Authority's priority was to stop Israel building settlements such as the Jerusalem project at Jabal Abu Ghenim, or Hor Homa where ground was broken on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem along with the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East War and considers all of the city its capital. The PA wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>At the United Nations on Thursday, the Security Council held inconclusive consultations on a request by a 22-member Arab group's for a meeting to demand that Israel halt the controversial construction.</p>
<p>Council members' Middle East experts were to consult further later in the day.</p>
<p>Council sources said the United States, which vetoed a resolution on March 7 calling on Israel to abandon plans for the project, was almost certain to veto another such draft.</p>
<p>In the Arab Silwan neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, five Jewish settler families moved into a sprawling house under the cover of darkness.</p>
<p>Since 1991 at least 18 settler families have moved into Silwan, home to 30,000 Palestinians. The area is just below the Old City walls where the biblical King David is said to have established the first capital of the Jewish people.</p>
