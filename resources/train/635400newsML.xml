<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan, South Africa to hold new talks.</title>
<headline>Taiwan, South Africa to hold new talks.</headline>

<p>Taiwan and South Africa plan to hold a third round of talks on Friday to negotiate their future relations after Pretoria switches ties to Beijing later this year, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Foreign ministry officials confirmed the sides would meet in Taipei on Friday, but were tight-lipped on details.</p>
<p>The South African delegation is led by vice foreign minister Aziz Pahad, ministry officials said.</p>
<p>Taiwan has said it hopes to maintain high-level contacts with South Africa after Pretoria and Beijing normalise ties.</p>
<p>President Nelson Mandela said in November 1996 that Pretoria would cut diplomatic ties with Nationalist-ruled Taiwan and recognise the island's communist rival by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Taipei responded by postponing all aid projects and treaties.</p>
<p>Taiwan's foreign minister John Chang recently said the island would consider resuming economic cooperation programmes and direct flights after the sides reach agreement on the nature of bilateral ties.</p>
<p>South Africa is the largest of only 30 countries -- mostly underdeveloped states in central America and Africa -- that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government rather than the communist mainland's People's Republic.</p>
<p>Beijing, which has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949, insists the island is ineligible for foreign ties and has tightened a diplomatic squeeze on Taipei in its quest to bring Taiwan under mainland rule.</p>
