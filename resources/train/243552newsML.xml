<p>J.C. Penney Co. Inc. has agreed to divest 161 drug stores in North and South Carolina by March in order to get government approval for two acquisitions, the Federal Trade Commission said Monday.</p>
<p>Penney is taking over drug store operator Eckerd Co. in a $3.3 billion deal and is acquiring 190 Rite Aid stores in the Carolinas.</p>
<p>In a statement, the FTC said the agreement resolved charges that Penney's acquisitions would violate federal antitrust laws. The FTC was concerned that Penney would have been in a position to raise prices for pharmacy services for health insurance companies and other third-party purchasers.</p>
<p>J.C. Penney, based in Plano, Texas, owns 1,089 drug stores in 17 states through its Pittsburgh-based subidiary, Thrift Drug.</p>
<p>In the deal, which is subject to a 60-day comment period before it receives final approval by the FTC, Penney agreed to sell 34 Thrift Drug stores in the Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham areas of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Penney also agreed to find a buyer for 127 of 190 of the Rite Aid stores in North Carolina and Charleston, S.C.</p>
<p>Penney can hold on to the other 63 Rite Aid stores, which are in other parts of South Carolina, the FTC said.</p>
<p>The FTC said that would resolve its concerns about concentration of ownership in the area.</p>
<p>Separately, Penney said it completed its $35-a-share cash tender offer for roughly 35.3 million Eckerd common shares on Friday.</p>
<p>Penney said it had accepted for payment only about 59.5 percent of the roughly 59.3 million Eckerd shares tendered to its Omega Acquisition Corp. unit.</p>
<p>Penney said it expected to announce and pay the final proration percentage for the shares within the next seven business days.</p>
<p>It added that it expected to complete the $3.3 billion acquisition during the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Largo, Fla.-based Eckerd's 1,724 drug stores in 13 states will be merged into Penney's Thrift Drug division.</p>
<p>Eckerd's stock fell 25 cents to $33.75, Penney rose 25 cents to $51.75 and Rite Aid was off 12.5 cents at $40.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.</p>
