<headline>BASF denies dividend payout over 1 bln dmk.</headline>

<p>German chemicals company BASF AG on Wednesday denied a magazine report which said its chief financial officer Dietrich Kley had predicted the group's total dividend payout would rise to more than one billion marks for 1996.</p>
<p>A BASF spokesman said in response to a Reuter enquiry that Kley did not make that statement in an interview with &quot;Das Wertpapier&quot; magazine.</p>
<p>&quot;What is correct is that Mr Kley confirmed earlier statements that BASF is seeking a higher share price level which would then have to be correspondingly underpinned with dividend,&quot; the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>Das Wertpapier reported that Kley had said BASF would for the first time distribute more than one billion marks ($626.5 million) in dividends to its shareholders for the 1996 year.</p>
<p>The BASF spokesman said a dividend total of one billion marks would mean a payout of 1.64 marks per share, up from 1.40 marks for 1995. &quot;Most banks currently estimate our dividend for 1996 will be 1.60 marks,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>BASF chief executive Juergen Strube last November hinted the company might announce a higher dividend by saying shareholders might have reason to celebrate the payout.</p>
<p>The BASF spokesman confirmed a statement made by Kley to the magazine that BASF did not at present plan any takeovers in Germany.</p>
<p>Kley denied that BASF was interested in buying chemicals and metals company Degussa which like BASF has a large share of the vitamins market.</p>
<p>The interview with Das Wertpapier was conducted on December 27 last year.</p>
