<headline>LIFFE coffee off lows by close on panic buying.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-30</dateline>

<p>Coffee futures pulled back from the lows by panic price-fixing buying ahead of Friday's first November tender day but still ended down on earlier speculative selling.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from it going berserk, we had a lot of panicky fixing against carrying-in this afternoon,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>&quot;We got until tomorrow to fix (prices),&quot; she said. Friday is the first notice/tender day for spot month November contract. By the close, January stood $10 down at $1,390 a tonne after hitting a low of $1,365. But it stopped short of challenging an immediate support at $1,360.</p>
<p>The spot November led the losers as some players rolled over their November positions into January before the spot expiry.</p>
<p>This helped narrow the hefty November premium to January to $95 by the close from Tuesday's $122.</p>
<p>Volume on the exchange reached 3,703 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said the active Nov/Jan switch saw some trades at $110 after ranging between $86 and $128. The Jan/March spread saw deals at $55 and $65.</p>
<p>Traders said the Nov/Jan spread, until now backed by tight availability of nearby supplies, could come under pressure from next week as more fresh coffee is graded and tendered.</p>
<p>Origins are keen to unload coffee to be in time for the November delivery in view of the relatively large November premium.</p>
<p>In other news, traders kept a close eye on the crisis in Zaire following escalated fighting in the eastern part of the country where most of its crop is grown.</p>
<p>With the main Zairean crop is not due until December, traders said there was no cause for panic yet. But they said supplies could be threatened if chaos persisted.</p>
