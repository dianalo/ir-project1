<p>Groupe UIC, a unit of distressed French insurer GAN, said on Thursday it expected to post a 1996 net loss of 7.9 billion francs, due mainly to exceptional provisions of 5.4 billion francs for property.</p>
<p>&quot;In total, UIC's consolidated net loss for 1996 should be around 7.9 billion francs,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>UIC will record a 1996 loss of 2.5 billion francs excluding the property provisions, using a new accounting method, it said. The loss is bigger than previous loss forecasts due to unfavourable trends in the property market and the core business, it said.  </p>
<p>GAN has said it would recapitalise UIC to the tune of 7.1 billion francs, UIC said.</p>
<p>&quot;UIC, as UIC's majority shareholder, with the state's support, has said it would take steps in 1997 to ensure its subsdiary will have the equity capital needed to meet statutory capital ratio requirements after a significant reduction in the group's size,&quot; UIC said.</p>
<p>&quot;This implies a recapitalisation of around 7.1 billion francs, on top of the 800 million francs injected in December 1996,&quot; UIC said.</p>
<p>UIC's provisioning for gross lending and loans to property professionals will be respectively 63 and 73 percent at the end of 1996, it said.</p>
<p>The market had previously been expecting UIC to post 1996 losses of around five billion francs.</p>
<p>GAN has decided to make a public offer and cancellation of stock in UIC and the Sofal unit which are not held by GAN. The suspension of trading in UIC and Sofal shares was to allow the appointment of an independent expert, it said.</p>
<p>GAN earlier said the French government has pledged 20 billion francs to shore up GAN's accounts and to prepare it for privatisation. Some 11 billion will be in the form of a capital injection and nine billion will cover estimated losses.</p>
