<p>--Evidence of a crisis in ruling party PASOK is growing daily. At yesterday's meeting of PASOK MPs, Prime Minister Costas Simitis stressed that the party was not governing in an effort to ensure privilege or power, indicating modernisers and traditionalists were on course for collision.</p>
<p>--Bullish sentiment in international markets is bolstering the upward trend in Greek shares. The Athens bourse appears to be making a strong recovery from last year's Delta scandal.</p>
<p>--Problems in the sale of state-run enterprises have appeared once again, despite the government's determination to push ahead with its privatisation programme. </p>
<p>--US State Department official Carey Canavaugh is cultivating a climate of &quot;diplomatic optimism&quot;, saying that he hopes to have achieved a resolution of the Cyprus problem before Russian S-300 missiles are deployed on the island. Ankara, however, appears to disagree.</p>
