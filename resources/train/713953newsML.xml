<headline>Motorola hits high ahead of second-quarter earnings.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>Technology giant Motorola Inc.'s stock jumped to its highest level ever Tuesday, boosted by expectations the company's second-quarter results will at least meet Wall Street expectations, analysts said.</p>
<p>Motorola rose $1.56 to $81.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after hitting an all-time high of $83 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;People are expecting solid results, or to see progress ahead of schedule,&quot; said Douglas Christopher, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. Christopher said the stock traded above $82.50 for the first time since the summer of 1995.</p>
<p>Motorola was to report second-quarter earnings later Tuesday.</p>
<p>The consensus analyst forecast for Motorola's second-quarter earnings is 56 cents a share, up from 54 cents a share a year ago, according to the First Call service. The estimates exclude a $170 million charge the company said it will take to exit the dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chip business.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expect revenues to rise slightly to $7.0 billion to $7.15 billion vs. $6.83 billion last year.</p>
<p>Analysts said the predicted rise in earnings will reflect a recovery under way in the company's key sectors.</p>
<p>Motorola has suffered from a downturn in the semiconductor industry and stiff competition in the cellular phone business, the company has said. Its paging segment has been affected by operators reducing inventories.</p>
