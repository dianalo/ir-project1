<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-06</dateline>

<p>German Bunds remained higher in late trade, surviving bouts of profit taking brought on by a 70 basis point rally since Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Traders said strong U.S. Treasuries, supported by the outcome of the U.S. presidental election, lifted Bunds which closely tracked their U.S. counterparts after several sessions of underperforming them.</p>
<p>The December Bund future was up 14 basis points in late trade to 100.32 after trading as high as 100.47 not long after the market opened.  </p>
<p>The Bund/T-note spread was steady at 46 basis points late in the day, recovering from earlier losses relative to U.S. debt.</p>
<p>The yield curve, which has been flattening, steepened because of what one analyst said was a technical rebound.</p>
<p>The release of the European Monetary Institute convergence report which said EU states were dragging their heels on getting their public finances in order had little lasting impact on Bunds.</p>
<p>Analysts said the report contained few surprises.</p>
