<p>The European Commission is to clear 2.75 trillion lire ($1.6 billion) of aid to troubled Italian flag carrier Alitalia next Wednesday, a Commission official told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Commission officials discussed the draft clearance deal early on Thursday and recommended that the proposal go through without discussion during the EU executive's weekly meeting in Strasbourg, the official said.</p>
<p>The airline, which chalked up its ninth straight year of losses in 1996, agreed to a rescue package with unions a year ago after months of bitter battle over plans to slash hefty personnel costs and boost productivity.</p>
<p>The deal would trim the government aid sought by the airline from three trillion ($1.75 billion) to 2.75 trillion lire, as agreed in talks between Brussels and Rome, while forcing it to sell its 35 percent stake in Hungarian national airline Malev.</p>
<p>Draft plans, seen by Reuters, would clear two billion lire of government aid to be paid immediately with a further 500 billion lire due in May 1998 and 250 billion lire a year later.</p>
<p>The two trillion figure includes one trillion already advanced to Alitalia in June last year, the plans said.</p>
<p>Payment of the second and third tranches would be subject to the airline respecting the approval conditions imposed.</p>
<p>In return, Alitalia would cut 1,212 staff from its payroll during the four years from December 1996, leaving it with 16,178 people, while holding its fleet at 157 aircraft over the same period instead of growing it to 172 as foreseen in the original restructuring plan.</p>
<p>The Commission would also seek a promise from Italian authorities that they behave as &quot;normal shareholders&quot; in relations with the mainly state-owned airline and refrain from giving further subsidy in the form of loan guarantees.</p>
<p>Authorities would also have to agree not to prefer Alitalia over other EU carriers in the allocation of traffic rights, take-off and landing slots, ground-handling services and access to airport infrastructures.</p>
<p>Alitalia, whose behaviour would be subject to annual Commission scrutiny for the four years from March 1998, would be forbidden from using its new cash to buy into other carriers.</p>
<p>The airline would also have to sell off its remaining five percent stake in aeronautical engineering firm Alfa Romeo Avio, along with holdings in regional airports in Genoa, Naples, Rimini, Florence, Lamezia Terme and Turin.</p>
<p>Commission-imposed capacity limits, which would apply to aircraft leasing or block-space arrangements as well as to standard operations, would cap both the number of seats offered each year and the allowed growth in seat-kilometres.</p>
<p>Alitalia would be barred from using its new cash to offer cheaper fares than its competitors until the end of 2000.</p>
<p>Another approval condition would require that any sale of Alitalia's headquarters building be made at market rates to prevent illegal subsidy payments under a different guise.</p>
<p>Commercial director Federico Nucci said recently that Alitalia's current performance was ahead of forecasts and predicted a &quot;significant profit&quot; for 1997. ($ = 1722 Italian Lire)</p>
