<p>Congress on Friday moved one step closer to tearing down the Depression-era barriers separating banking from other financial services, as the House Banking Committee approved a comprehensive reform bill.</p>
<p>But the proposal, adopted on a narrow 28-26 vote, still faces substantial hurdles before becoming law.</p>
<p>Congress has been debating bank reform for more than a decade, but the efforts have always been blocked when the various financial service industries failed to reach a consensus. The banking committee has approved legislation on three previous occassions.</p>
<p>Opposition to the bill was bipartisan, as 12 Republicans joined 14 Democrats voting &quot;nay.&quot; Supporters counted 18 Republicans and 10 Democrats among their ranks.</p>
<p>&quot;This bill is in real trouble,&quot; said industry analyst Bert Ely, president of Ely &amp; Co. &quot;This is an incredibly weak vote.&quot;</p>
<p>But committee Chairman Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, argued the vote simply reflected the balanced nature of the legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;It says these are extremely sensitive issues with extremely great balancing differences,&quot; Leach told reporters after the vote.</p>
<p>The bill next goes to the Commerce Committee for further consideration. That committee may enhance provisions in the bill allowing state insurance regulators to oversee bank insurance sales, lobbyists said.</p>
<p>The committee may also broaden controversial amendments the banking committee attached to the bill that would allow banks to own or be owned by commercial companies.</p>
<p>Ranking Democrat Henry Gonzalez, who strongly opposed mixing banking and commerce, voted against the bill.</p>
<p>&quot;This bill is a great disappointment,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead of making reasonable and needed changes, it makes radical and needless change.&quot;</p>
<p>If the bill becomes law with or without the banking and commerce provisions, banks, insurance companies and securities firms could combine and offer consumers &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for financial services.</p>
<p>Federal courts and regulators have allowed some mixing already, for example permitting Bankers Trust New York Corp. to acquire the regional brokerage firm Alex Brown &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The legislation would also overhaul the Home Loan Bank system, eliminate the savings and loan industry, and create a new national council to oversee financial regulations.</p>
<p>Banks and insurance companies both objected to portions of the bill. Banks wanted federal bank regulators to have broad authority to overrule state insurance regulations when applied to banks. Insurers wanted federal pre-emption authority sharply curtailed.</p>
<p>The banking and insurance industries Friday both said they were concerned by aspects of the bill. But, in separate statements, neither group expressed outright opposition or said they would try to block the legislation as it moves through the legislative process.</p>
<p>Securities firms got much of what they wanted, especially the provision allowing financial companies to own commercial companies. Wall Street firms have commercial investments and want to enter banking without being forced to divest.</p>
<p>&quot;It is vital that the House and Senate move swiftly ahead on this legislation,&quot; said David Komansky, chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's largest brokerage.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has estimated consumers could save as much as $15 billion a year from increased competition and efficiency under the proposed reforms.</p>
<p>However, consumer groups oppose the legislation, warning that the giant financial supermarkets may be in a better position to mislead, coerce and overcharge for financial services.</p>
