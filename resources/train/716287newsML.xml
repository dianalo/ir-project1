<p>A Philippine judge on Wednesday dismissed charges of illegal entry against 21 Chinese fishermen arrested near a shoal in the South China Sea claimed by Manila and Beijing.</p>
<p>Judge Eliodoro Ubiadas told Reuters he had signed an order for the release of the Chinese, who were arrested by the Philippine Navy in May off Scarborough Shoal, west of the main Philippine island of Luzon.</p>
<p>The Chinese embassy has demanded the release of the fishermen, saying they were in Chinese territory when the Philippine Navy apprehended them and impounded their boat. The fishermen are being held by police in Subic town, near Olongapo, about 80 km (50 miles) northwest of Manila.</p>
<p>Beijing says all the isles, reefs and shoals in the South China Sea historically belong to China. Manila says the shoal is within its exclusive economic zone and it has sole sovereignty over it.</p>
<p>The shoal lies well north of the Spratly islands, a cluster of potentially oil-rich isles, shoals and atolls which Beijing also says has belonged to China since ancient times. The Spratlys are also claimed wholly or in part by Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.</p>
