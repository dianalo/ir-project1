<p>Mexico's Grupo Sidek holding company will still be a going concern even if it has to sell assets and downsize to pay off its heavy debts, the group's founder told Reuters.</p>
<p>Jorge Martinez Guitron, who together with his brother Jose, was listed by Forbes magazine in 1994 as being among the 358 richest men in the world, said that even if the company did not manage to complete its financial restructuring plan, the firm could still sell off assets to pay its way.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course (Sidek) has to downsize...(but) it is hard for a company like this to vanish,&quot; said Martinez, chairman of the board at Sidek.</p>
<p>Sidek is expected to produce a debt restructuring plan some time this month, having obtained a period of grace from Mexican creditors.</p>
<p>Sidek has had severe financial problems since the Mexican peso was suddenly and unexpectedly devalued in December 1994. Sidek posted a nine-month loss for 1996, compared to earnings for the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>To add to Sidek's troubles, a New York judge ruled against Sidek the same day as it posted its nine-month loss, on October 28, and in favor of holders of Class &quot;B&quot; notes, who had sued the group for $20 million in damages.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of our assets are in dollarised zones,&quot; said Martinez, adding that that would prevent a fire-sale of its assets to pay off obligations held with foreign investors and Mexican banks.</p>
<p>Martinez said the group did not have a debt restructuring plan yet, but said it would consist of selling off assets mostly in the group's tourist arm Situr, and its factoring and shipbuilding interests.</p>
<p>One of the remaining arms would be the minimill steelmaking subsidiary Simec which, Martinez said, presented no problems as the collapse in the domestic market had been offset by exports.</p>
<p>&quot;The tourist arm will be the smallest,&quot; he said. &quot;We will sell our U.S. assets, which are denominated in dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>The factoring firm Kapital Haus &quot;would indeed tend to disappear&quot;, Martinez said.</p>
<p>Sinam, which operates three shipyards &quot;makes a profit repairing ships, but does other things...the idea is to quit that business, as it is small&quot;, Martinez added.</p>
<p>Siturbe, an urban infrastructure company, &quot;has been halted altogether&quot;, he said.</p>
