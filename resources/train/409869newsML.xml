<headline>LME lead shines on strong finish, just below $700.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lead clung tightly to most of its gains on Friday from a blistering rally which propelled prices above $700 at one point.</p>
<p>Lead prices ended the London Metal Exchange (LME) afternoon kerb at $698 per tonne, a gain of $23 versus Thursday's finish.</p>
<p>Options related buying, fund shortcovering and tight April dates were responsible for the metal's dramatic surge which hit a high of $705 in the afternoon kerb, traders said.</p>
<p>Ahead of next Wednesday's options declaration, open interest was concentrated on $725 calls.</p>
<p>Cash to threes backwardation was at $20/$21 at the close, compared to level on Thursday, after April tightness emerged.</p>
<p>The market was also eyeing Friday's expiry of a labour contract at Canada's Noranda Brunswick lead/zinc mine and lead smelter for direction.</p>
<p>Other metals were largely softer, in part on end-of-month profit taking and book squaring.</p>
<p>Copper intially dipped to a low of $2,362, from Thursday's kerb close of $2,393, after LME stocks came in down an expected 3,475 tonnes.</p>
<p>But prices bounced up to finish the kerb at $2,378.</p>
<p>Aluminium was underpinned by a substantial LME stock decline of 11,075 tonnes on Friday morning.</p>
<p>However, it failed to move out of a narrow range and ended the kerb just $2 firmer at $1,654.</p>
<p>Nickel repeated Thursday's strong close of $8,070 against a backdrop of continued concerns about possible labour unrest in Russia's Norilsk Nickel factory.</p>
<p>Management and labour are due to meet on Saturday.</p>
<p>But Dresdner Kleinwort Benson said in a weekly report that expectations of a strike at Norilsk on March 15 may be exaggerated.</p>
<p>&quot;...looming labour unrest in this sensitive industry in the past was usually prevented via successful negotiations,&quot; the bank said.</p>
<p>Zinc and tin fared less well than the other base metals.</p>
<p>Tin closed nearly $100 down at $5,790, compared to $5,880 on Thursday. A stocks rise of 170 tonnes did little to improve the market's sluggish tone.</p>
<p>Zinc held steady most of the day and made a halfhearted attempt to push higher at the afternoon kerb. But the effort fell flat and the metal finished at $1,218, down $9.</p>
<p>Alloy was last indicated at $1,540/45 versus $1,550.</p>
