<p>President Boris Yeltsin had almost the entire Russian cabinet on tenterhooks on Wednesday after ordering a reshuffle in which no minister is safe except the prime minister and his newly appointed first deputy.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, unveiling the shake-up agonisingly slowly, told Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to present proposals for the changes within a week but made clear new First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais would stay on.</p>
<p>The State Duma lower house of parliament planned to discuss the reshuffle later on Wednesday at the request of the opposition communists, ultra-nationalists and Agrarians.</p>
<p>Chubais' promotion has enraged the opposition, which loathes him for masterminding Yeltsin's successful re-election campaign last year and for his role in overseeing privatisation, in which they say state assets were sold off too cheaply.</p>
<p>The United States welcomed Yeltsin's changes, saying they showed that Yeltsin was firmly back in control and determined to press on with reforms after many months' absence from the Kremlin due to heart problems and pneumonia.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that he has retained Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais means one thing -- Russia continues to be headed in a reform direction,&quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;President Yeltsin is back. President Yeltsin has firm control of the Russian government ... There's no question that what we've seen over the last two weeks is a resurgent, very forceful, reform-minded President Boris Yeltsin,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The apparent improvement in Yeltsin's health could hardly have come at a better time for Washington, with President Bill Clinton due to meet the Russian leader at a Helsinki summit March 19-20.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov is due in Washington on Saturday to prepare the summit agenda. He meets Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Saturday and Clinton on Monday.</p>
<p>Primakov and recently-promoted Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, who became deputy premier, look likely to keep their jobs in the rolling government shake-up but the nightmare goes on for more than 30 ministers already awaiting their fate for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not clear who will join the government other than the promises that they will be 'young and energetic',&quot; Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko political group, told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 66, made clear he wanted a reshuffle at a meeting with Chernomyrdin on February 24 at which he criticised the government's failure to pay wages and pensions on time.</p>
<p>He demanded sweeping changes in a state of the nation speech on March 6 and appointed Chubais, until then the chief of his Kremlin administration, on March 7.</p>
<p>All ministers dealing with the economy and social policy have some cause for concern in moves which Yeltsin hopes will ease tension over a huge backlog in wages and pensions which has prompted plans for nationwide protests on March 27.</p>
<p>Desperate pensioners in one region northwest of Moscow blocked a railway line for more than five hours on Tuesday to demand their unpaid pensions.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Igor Rodionov, 60, is also in the firing line. Yeltsin has told him to stop &quot;whining&quot; and to get on with much delayed military reforms.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has also begun changing his presidential team. He named 39-year-old former journalist Valentin Yumashev on Tuesday to replace Chubais as head of the Kremlin administration.</p>
<p>He also appointed Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, 55, the last Soviet defence minister, to be a Kremlin aide overseeing Russia's declining civil aviation and space sectors.</p>
