<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate ends up on month-end cash demand.</title>

<text>
<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates hung onto earlier increases to close up 70 basis points at 21.25 percent on Wednesday amid month-end demand for cash, dealers said.</p>
<p>Fixed-income analysts said dealing saw a tug-of-war between players with hefty liquidity positions, who wanted to jack up rates, and those who were long paper and wished to keep rates down.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some upward speculative pressure, but it was offset by those holding paper, who did their best to hold rates down,&quot; one analyst said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said rates also came under upside pressure from higher U.S. long bond yields and uncertainty ahead of forthcoming mid-term elections in Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico will hold elections on July 6 to renew the entire lower house of Congress, one-quarter of the Senate, several state governor's and the first poll for Mexico City mayor in modern times.</p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was off 19/32 to yield 6.74 percent in late trade.</p>
<p>The central bank drained 1.551 billion pesos from the market by assigning three direct Cetes sales and three repos.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile rose 10 basis points to 22.15 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 2.995 billion pesos was due to return to the system on Thursday from prior central bank operations.</p>
