<p>Wilson Boit Kipketer won a dramatic sprint finish between three Kenyans to seal his first major title in the world 3,000 metres steeplechase final on Wednesday, upstaging world record holder Moses Kiptanui in the process.</p>
<p>After defending champion Kiptanui had led from the start, the 23-year-old Kipketer burst past his compatriot down the home straight to win in eight minutes 05.84 seconds.</p>
<p>Kiptanui, who was bidding to become the first man to win four successive world track titles, took silver in 8:06.04 with Bernard Barmasai completing a Kenyan clean sweep in exactly the same time.</p>
<p>It was the second consecutive time that Kiptanui has lost out in a tight finish at a major championship after winning the world title in 1991, 1993 and 1995.</p>
<p>At last year's Atlanta Olympics Kiptanui could also not match the final kick of compatriot and training partner Joseph Keter and also took silver.</p>
<p>Kiptanui said the three Kenyans had talked about the race beforehand and had carried out a plan to make sure the pace was fast.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a plan. We knew that if the race was slow it would be difficult for us to finish in the top three,&quot; he said. &quot;That is why we were in front and going faster and faster all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>Used to being accompanied through the first part of races by a pacemaker on the grand prix circuit, Kiptanui ran a brave race from the front from the start.</p>
<p>He was ahead at the bell as the three Kenyans set a furious pace down the back straight. The steeplechasers came over the water jump almost together before Kipketer produced his brilliant finish.</p>
<p>&quot;When I broke through I knew the race was mine because I have been training specifically for the last 300 metres, &quot; Kipketer said. &quot;It's great that Kenya got one-two-three. It is what the Kenyan people have been waiting for.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the three of us could cooperate to break the record...We have got what we wanted -- all three medals.&quot;</p>
<p>Kiptanui, 26, has been working more as a coach recently and has been training a group of more than 30 athletes.</p>
<p>The world record holder said he still felt he could continue his career on the track.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;Who knows what can happen? Maybe in one year's time I will not be in the same position as I am now.&quot;</p>
