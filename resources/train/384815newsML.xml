<p>The leader of a U.S. white supremacist group pleaded guilty on Tuesday to plotting robberies at seven Midwestern banks and using the money to further the group's cause, FBI officials said.</p>
<p>Mark Thomas, leader of the Aryan Republican Army in Pennsylvania, changed his original plea of innocent to guilty, said Paul Hendrickson, an FBI agent in Philadelphia. He said Thomas was cooperating with the FBI in the ongoing conspiracy investigation.</p>
<p>Thomas pleaded innocent on Feb. 4 shortly after being indicted with four other men, all members or associates of the white supremacist group. Thomas' attorney, David Maynard, was not available for comment.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Thomas saw the evidence against him and decided it wasn't a very good defence strategy (to plead innocent),&quot; Hendrickson said.</p>
<p>Thomas, who is in jail along with the four others, faces a maximum prison sentence of 25 years for conspiracy and two counts of receiving stolen money. Hendrickson said he expected the sentence to be reduced in exchange for Thomas' cooperation.</p>
<p>Thomas and the four others are accused of plotting seven of 22 Midwest bank robberies attributed to the Aryan Republican Army.</p>
<p>Thomas was accused of recruiting members in his home in Macungie, Pennsylvania. A grand jury said the members divided the robbery proceeds among themselves and gave cash to Thomas for the organisation.</p>
