<p>The Afghan faction led by Uzbek warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum controls a strategic road tunnel northwest of the Afghan capital Kabul, a faction spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our forces moved forward three or four days ago and took positions abandoned by the government (of deposed President Burnahuddin Rabbani) around the tunnel,&quot; Jumbish-i-Milli faction spokesman General Mohammed Yusef told reporters.</p>
<p>The tunnel, 70 km (45 miles) northwest of Kabul, is situated on the Salang highway, a key road linking Kabul to northern Afghanistan and the Central Asian republics beyond. It is part of a crucial link between Afghanistan and the outside world.</p>
<p>South of the tunnel lies the town of Jabal-us-Siraj, which was seized by the Islamic Taleban movement on Monday in its push north from the capital Kabul.</p>
<p>Yusef said there was no fighting around the tunnel and that it was completely under the control of Jumbish -- the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The territories in northern Afghanistan controlled by Jumbish have been tense ever since the radical Islamic Taleban militia seized Kabul last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to fight, we've never fought the Taleban,&quot; Yusef said. &quot;We are open to negotiations, we're ready to talk to them (the Taleban).&quot;</p>
<p>Dostum's faction has for the most part kept a nervous silence ever since the Taleban's lightning move on Kabul.</p>
<p>Dostum holds the largest chunk of territory in Afghanistan outside Taleban control.</p>
<p>But the two factions have little in common.</p>
<p>Dostum's overwhelmingly Uzbek faction is relatively liberal compared to the radical Taleban, a movement made up mostly of Pashtuns from southern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Taleban have introduced strict Islamic law in the regions they control, ordering government employees to grow beards within one and a half months and banning women from the workplace.</p>
<p>Women in the bustling centre of Mazar-i-Sharif, a relatively wealthy Afghan town, have expressed concern that Taleban could enter their area.</p>
<p>&quot;We would have to live at home like slaves, we could not even go to the bazaar,&quot; Isabel, a 22-year-old student of English at the university said on Monday.</p>
