<p>A Russian coastguard vessel on Thursday fired on a foreign cargo ship trying to leave the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk without permission.</p>
<p>The Russian border guard service said the freighter Imia was later towed back to the port and no members of the crew had been injured. It did not say if the ship was hit.</p>
<p>The freighter, sailing under the Panamian flag with a crew of 17 Ukrainians and one Tanzanian, tried to leave Russian territorial waters without customs or border checks, the statement added.</p>
<p>The Russian vessel contacted the ship and ordered it to stop but the Imia ignored the command.</p>
<p>After a warning salvo the Russian commander ordered direct shots fired. &quot;The cargo ship stopped and the captain made contact,&quot; the border guards added.</p>
<p>The statement said the Imia brought a cargo of fruit to Novorossiisk on December 13 from the Greek port of Piraeus. But, after a dispute over the quality of the cargo, a fine of $18,000 was imposed on the captain.</p>
<p>&quot;In a flagrant violation of international law the freighter ...tried to escape,&quot; the statement quoted Lieutenant-General Mikhail Shkuruk, head of customs control, as saying.</p>
<p>He added it was not the first such incident.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not tolerate anarchy and disorder on the state border of Russia...Any illegal action will be stopped in the most decisive way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a separate incident, a cargo ship under the Maltese flag and carrying bananas from Panama caught fire at the Baltic port of Lomonosov, 40 km (25 miles) from Russia's second city of St Petersburg.</p>
<p>All the crew was taken off but one firefighter was missing, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
