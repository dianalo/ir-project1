<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-04-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss bonds extended gains Wednesday ahead of a bank holiday in Zurich on Thursday.</p>
<p>The June Confederate bond futures contract regained the March 17 high of 119.72 during the session, and closed firm but off highs. Traders saw strong demand for three- to five-year bonds and medium-term &quot;Comi&quot; futures.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is in really good shape and we have seen major trades in shorter maturities including Comi-related trades,&quot; said one trader at a Swiss bank. He added that the curve was likely to continue to steepen.</p>
<p>Comi futures ended Wednesday up 17 basis points at 111.55.  </p>
<p>&quot;Conf&quot; futures ended 20 basis points higher at 119.64</p>
<p>In the short end of the market, trade was quiet. Tomorrow/next money was quoted late on Wednesday around 1-1/2 percent, off peaks seen earlier this week, when the rate tightened on technical factors ahead of month's end.</p>
<p>The next key domestic event for the market may be a speech by Swiss National Bank board member Bruno Gehrig set for Friday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, SNB chairman Hans Meyer was quoted in the Basler Zeitung daily as saying that foreign demand remained a key to the country's future economic performance.  </p>
<p>Markets focused on Meyer's comment that the Swiss National Bank did not conduct exchange rate policy, but monetary policy. The remark temporarily boosted the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>-- Wednesday's closing prices as follows:</p>
<p>Conf futures up 20 at 119.64.</p>
<p>Comi medium-term bond up 17 at 111.55</p>
<p>Euro Swiss francs up one at 98.21.</p>
<p>4-1/2 Jun 2007 bond 107.75/85 yield 3.56 pct</p>
<p>(Tuesday's close 107.60/70 yield 3.58 pct)</p>
