<p>U.S. Municipal bonds closed down 3/8 to 1/2 point after modestly trimming earlier losses incurred when strong November housing starts data hurt U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>&quot;I have (muni prices) down like 3/8, I don't think you can say a lot more than that,&quot; a trader said. &quot;The market's just absolutely pathetic. There's just so little going on it's hard to figure out what the bids are.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader said a fair amount of inventory from recent competitive and negotiated issues remains in dealer hands and the market is &quot;just drifting.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We bounced off the bottom this morning, but there's just no spin out there, and if you want to get something done it's going to cost you,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The trader said ever since Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested on December 5 that stocks might be overvalued the market has had &quot;a real thin skin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So today, when the numbers came out with housing starts, there's not much out there to hold it in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the governmnent market, the benchmark 30-year bond pared back earlier losses to end down 15/32 at 97-28/32 to yield 6.66 percent.  </p>
<p>In debt futures, the March municipal contract closed down 5/32 at 115-4/32. The March T-bond contract closed down 7/32 at 112-17/32. The MOB spread was 83 ticks.</p>
<p>November housing starts jumped 9.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.514 million units, marking their biggest surge in 16 months and far outpacing expectations. October and September's starts were also revised upward.</p>
<p>A municipal analyst judged the overall muni market down 3/8 to 1/2 point, after having been down 1/2 to 5/8 at one stage.</p>
