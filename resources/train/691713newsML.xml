<p>Rising sales combined with a government-financed restructuring are the main reasons behind a rush privatisation plan for Hungarian busmaker Ikarus Rt, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Hungarian government, in a surprise move, on Thursday ordered state privatisation agency APV Rt to issue new tenders in August for Ikarus, even though the busmaker is not listed in APV's privatisation programme for 1997 and a previous tender plan failed last year for lack of interest.</p>
<p>The tender for the 63.9 percent state-owned stake would require the successful bidder to assume 16 billion forints in liabilities.</p>
<p>In an interview, APV officials said sales last year of only 800 buses had left Ikarus on the verge of collapse, but increased sales this year should allow the company, once one of the world's biggest busmakers, to break even.</p>
<p>In addition, a government injection of eight billion forints for restructuring, including a reduction of about 600 administrative staff, has made the company more competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year's production (of 800 buses) was a serious situation for the company, we saw that the company would collapse,&quot; Balint Kerdo, an APV official in charge of the Ikarus privatisation, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This year we can see that the company will reach a breakeven point...with between 1,500 and 2,000 buses. This quantity is good enough to break even, just before a profit,&quot; added APV deputy managing director Peter Endrody.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why we thought that it is better to release the company from state ownership to make it easier for the management to realise this programmme.&quot;</p>
<p>When big European busmakers such as DAF Trucks NV of the Netherlands, Scania AB and Volvo AB of Sweden failed to submit bids last year, APV Rt turned to a Hungarian entrepreneur, Gabor Szeles, for damage control at Ikarus.</p>
<p>Szeles, credited with the turnaround of Hungary's once money-losing state electronics firm Videoton, announced earlier this month Ikarus had orders for 2,500 buses and he expected to turn a profit, after 4.5 billion forints in losses last year.</p>
<p>Kerdo said the projection for 2,500 buses was &quot;not quite sure&quot; but 2,000 seemed possible. He said Ikarus's performance might well elicit more bids than the last time around, and that contacts had been maintained with the Swedish firms.</p>
<p>He said one problem during the last tender offer was that Western companies wanted to buy only parts of Ikarus.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to sell the shares, not the parts,&quot; Kerdo said. &quot;If they are interested in the shares I think there will be no problem and...we will have more and different candidates.&quot;</p>
<p>The APV officials said they did not think a minority stake of some 20 percent held by Russia's AO Avtotraktorexport would pose a major obstacle.</p>
<p>The Russian shareholders injected $50 million into Ikarus before the shares collapsed and have been demanding their money back plus interest.</p>
<p>The APV officials said a deal probably would be worked out following the privatisation and did not exclude the possibility of the Russian shareholders becoming part of a bid consortium.</p>
