<p>Environmental groups on Tuesday were closely watching several tight Congressional races that they said could turn on candidates' stands on pollution, logging and nuclear waste issues.</p>
<p>After waging an unprecedentedly intense political campaign, green groups were waiting to see to what extent the elections turned out to be a referendum on what they say has been a Republican bid over the last two years to rewrite environmental laws.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is: 'Did the environment play in this race?'&quot; said Deborah Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, which ran a $1.5 million campaign targeting 12 politicians for defeat.</p>
<p>Environmental issues were expected to play a major role in contests in California, the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest and some Rocky Mountain states, said Republican pollster Peter Snyder with Luntz Research Companies.</p>
<p>While unwilling to forecast what would happen in open seats, Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, predicted that some incumbent Republicans would lose in the toss-up races. &quot;(Voters) watched this Congress take on clean air, clean water, the national parks. They said this is not what we sent them up there for,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Sierra Club spent $7.5 million focusing on 10 Senate and 50 House contests. But Pope said he expected a lot of the group's candidates to lose because it chose tough races.</p>
<p>In House races widely viewed as too close to call green groups looked to oust, among others, Republican Reps. Frank Riggs in California's 1st district, Michael Flanagan in Illinois' 5th district, Jim Longley of Maine's 1st district, Andrea Seastrand of California's 22nd district, Steve Stockman of Texas' 9th district and Randy Tate of Washington's 9th district.</p>
<p>In key Senate contests, green groups attempted to defeat Republican Sens. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and Larry Pressler of South Dakota, while backing incumbent Democrats Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. In open Senate races they backed Colorado Democrat Tom Strickland against Republican Representative Wayne Allard; New Jersey Democrat Bob Torricelli against Republican Representative Dick Zimmer; and Oregon Democrat Tom Bruggere against Republican Gordon Smith.</p>
<p>Pope looked for the final count to show that Western states could no longer be considered a stronghold of mining and timber interests against protection of public lands. &quot;It would be a very powerful signal if we picked up one of the Nevada House seats,&quot; he said.</p>
