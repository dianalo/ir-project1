<p>Stocks were battered again Wednesday after a one-day rebound fizzled.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 88.75 points at 6,522.30 following Tuesday's 28-point gain.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues swamped advances by a 3-1 margin on active New York Stock Exchange volume of 275 million shares.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index plunged 15.43 points at 1,201.50.</p>
<p>Traders said lingering concerns that rising interest rates will lure investors from stocks and drain corporate profits kept buyers from jumping back into the stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no rush to get back into equities,&quot; said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray and Co. &quot;People are really worried about this higher interest-rate environment.&quot;</p>
<p>The rally on Tuesday came on the heels of two straight sessions of losses prior to the Easter holiday break last Thursday, and again on Monday that wiped out 300 points from the Dow as interest-rate jitters spread through Wall Street.</p>
<p>But traders said a weak bond market was enough reason to keep stock investors from following through on Tuesday's upturn.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the key 30-year Treasury bond was off 6/32, raising its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, to 7.09 percent from Tuesday's close of 7.08 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said there were buyers for stocks, but they were being selective about what price they are willing to pay for shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The buyers are definitely calling the shots,&quot; said Jay Meagrow, equity trader at McDonald &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Analysts said the latest batch of economic data was not a major factor.</p>
<p>New orders received by U.S. factories rose 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $325.9 billion following a 2.5 percent surge in January. Economists in a Reuters poll projected orders would grow 0.9 percent in February.</p>
<p>Among special situations, Project Software &amp; Development Inc. sank 15-3/8 to 15-7/8 after the company said its second quarter earnings would fall below last year's level due to the continued shortfall in revenues.</p>
<p>ShopKo Stores Inc. rose 1 to 16-1/4 on expectations that its major stockholder would be able to find a new deal to replace the $1 billion merger with Phar-Mor Inc. The companies said their merger was called off due to &quot;continuing uncertainties.&quot; Phar-Mor rose 1/4 to 5-1/4.</p>
