<p>Taiwan monopoly Chinese Petroleum confirmed on Friday it was evaluating plans to build a US$5.5-7.2 billion refinery and petrochemical complex, but said the project hinged on access to rival China's market.  </p>
<p>&quot;The project is still in the early stages of planning. One estimate shows the plan would cost US$5.5 to $7.2 billion,&quot; a Chinese Petroleum official said.</p>
<p>The plant, with capacity to process 300,000 barrels of crude a day, would be built in Taiwan by a new joint venture company of which state-owned Chinese Petroleum would hold a 35 percent stake, officials said.</p>
<p>Officials cautioned, however, that the project would not be launched before existing barriers to direct petroleum trade with arch rival mainland China were significantly reduced.  </p>
<p>&quot;The feasibility of this project will depend on access of our petrochemical products to the Chinese mainland market,&quot; the project manager of the proposed plant said.</p>
<p>&quot;If (Taiwan's) government allows shipping links, the plant's petrochemical products could supply the mainland. If such shipping links can't be realised, the cost of shipping would be too expensive and less competitive than for South Korea and other competing Asian countries,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Easing a five-decade ban, Taiwan in May began allowing local and mainland container ships to make limited direct crossings of the Taiwan strait, but still forbids direct cargo exchanges.</p>
<p>Containers arriving from the mainland cannot enter Taiwan customs and must be transhipped to other destinations.</p>
<p>Tankers remain forbidden to cross directly, reflecting Nationalist-ruled Taiwan's longtime ban on direct contacts with the mainland's communist government. The sides have been split since the end of a civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>Taiwan investors, who have poured investments worth US$30 billion into China despite the political frostiness, are eager for more direct trade and shipping access to the mainland.  </p>
<p>Also slated to join the joint venture are Grand Petrochem and China Rubber with a joint 33 percent stake, and Lee Chang Yung Chemical and Oriental Union with 10 percent each, officials said.</p>
<p>The remaining equity would be held by a dozen Taiwan firms.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed accounts said the refinery complex, as currently planned, would would have an annual production capacity of one million tonnes of ethylene and 500,000 tonnes of para-xylene.</p>
<p>The project, which has been on the drawing board for years, has taken on new urgency as the end of Chinese Petroleum's comfortable decades-old monopoly looms less than a year away.  </p>
<p>Chinese Petroleum said on Wednesday it would manage a joint venture with Japan's Kanematsu Corp and the southeast Asian sultanate of Brunei to build a US$1 billion petrochemical complex in Brunei.</p>
<p>The refinery, with 60,000 barrels capacity, would use Bruneian light sweet crude to produce 420,000 tonnes of paraxylene a year and 200,000 tonnes of benzene a year, mainly for export, Chinese Petroleum officials said.</p>
