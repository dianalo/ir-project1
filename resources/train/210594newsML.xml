<headline>Israel treasury seeks defence budget cut - sources.</headline>

<p>Israel's treasury fired the opening shots on Friday in a battle with the military establishment over further defence spending cuts.</p>
<p>Finance Ministry sources said the treasury planned to outline defence cuts as part of overall budget reductions in a paper to be presented to the cabinet early next month.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who won election in May on a platform stressing a strong military, has vowed to keep defence spending unchanged in 1997.</p>
<p>A senior army official said on Thursday budget cuts over the past decade had already harmed the military's operational capability, and although Israel could win a future war, it would pay a &quot;heavy price&quot; in casualties.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry sources would not say where the axe would fall but they added that combat units, officers' pay and benefits would not be hit. Cuts would centre on such projects as new buildings, they said.</p>
<p>Israeli defence sources have said in recent months that the military would need additional funds to meet the challenges of possible violence in the West Bank and Gaza, and to counter Syrian military moves.</p>
<p>&quot;A senior military figure told reporters yesterday that the army has been forced to use its emergency stores, and its operational capability has been harmed, because of budget cuts over the past ten years,&quot; army radio said on Friday.</p>
<p>In a future war, the official continued, &quot;the army can defend the nation and win,&quot; but the cost in casualties will be &quot;heavy.&quot;</p>
<p>The government has already approved a cut of 4.9 billion shekels in the overall budget for 1997, including 825 million shekels from the 30 billion earmarked for defence.</p>
<p>The 1996 defence budget totalled 27.41 billion shekels. The budgets for both years include $1.8 billion in U.S. military aid.</p>
<p>Parliament has until the end of this year to vote on the budget.</p>
<p>(3.26 shekels = (US$1)</p>
