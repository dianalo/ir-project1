<p>Most of Brazil's closely watched economic indicators will improve next year, but their performance in 1998 will hinge on progress made on the economic reform front, Lloyds Bank chief economist in Brazil Odair Abate said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if very little happens with privatization and reforms, the numbers are going to improve in 1997. The risk comes in 1998,&quot; Abate told reporters at a briefing on macroeconomic trends.  </p>
<p>Lower domestic interest rates, higher public rates and an improvement in state and municipal finances should lower the federal government's operational deficit to between 2.0 and 3.0 percent next year from an estimated 2.5 to 3.5 percent in 1996, Abate said.</p>
<p>He added that the economy should have little trouble growing by 4.0 to 5.0 percent of gross domestic product next year compared to an estimated 2.0 to 3.0 percent this year.  </p>
<p>But beyond 1997, improvement in the fiscal accounts, which Abate said should be policy-makers' chief goal, will depend on the success of the government's economic reform package. The package proposes constitutional changes to administrative, tax and social security laws which the government says are necessary to rein in spending.</p>
<p>Abate said the reforms, which have been put on hold in Congress until the end of municipal elections in November, have progressed much more slowly than economists originally anticipated.  </p>
<p>Still, Abate said Brazil faced no Mexico-style breakdown even if only slow progress is made on the reform front over the next two years.</p>
<p>&quot;The differences between Mexico and Brazil are immense,&quot; he said, adding that Brazil lost 30 percent of its foreign reserves after the December 1994 Mexican peso crisis without suffering serious consequences.</p>
<p>Lloyds' 1997 Brazilian forecasts also include a real-dollar rate of 1.10/1.11; foreign reserves of $63-64 billion; a trade deficit of between $2 billion and equilibrium; and a current account deficit of between 2.6 percent and 3.0 percent.</p>
