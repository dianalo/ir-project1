<p>Shares in Sony Corp shot to an all-time high of 10,000 yen on Friday, rekindling hopes that the popular stock can pull up other high technology issues, and the entire Japanese stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;Sony is the leader of the high-tech pack,&quot; said Noboru Yorita, general manager at Tachibana Securities. &quot;If the rally continues, other high-tech favourites such as TDK Corp and Kyocera Corp, whose share prices are a step behind Sony's, may be towed to similar heights.&quot;</p>
<p>Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities general manager, echoed this view. &quot;In recent sessions, investors were lost as fluctuations in the yen distorted trade direction,&quot; he said. &quot;But with the return of the high-techs, it will make it easier for investors to figure out what will lead in the upcoming June market.&quot;</p>
<p>June is considered a particularly auspicious month for Japanese stocks. Last year, the Nikkei average hit its highs for the year in June.</p>
<p>Sony defied the wobbly Nikkei benchmark for most of the day on Friday, before buckling under the weight of profit-taking just ahead of the close to end 30 yen lower at 9,810 yen, on turnover of 2.12 million shares.</p>
<p>The Nikkei average fell 243.42 points, or 1.20 percent, to settle at 20,068.81.</p>
<p>&quot;Turnover (in Sony shares) was fairly large and it didn't fall too hard despite profit-taking after its rise to 10,000, which means that there is still quite a lot of interest,&quot; a trader at a foreign brokerage said.</p>
<p>The Tokyo market took its cues from activity overnight in London, where Sony and other high-technology shares such as Hitachi Ltd flourished on the back of a weaker yen and recent robust earnings reports.</p>
<p>Brokers said the weaker yen also encouraged domestic and foreign investors in Tokyo, which pushed shares in Sony, a blue-chip exporter, to its new record high.</p>
<p>A strong dollar relative to the yen is bullish for exporters, as it makes prices of Japanese exports more competitive overseas.</p>
<p>The dollar traded above 116 yen on Friday in Tokyo, exceeding the 115 yen-per-dollar rate that Sony used to calculate its earnings forecast for the 1997/98 business year ending next March.</p>
<p>Brokers said Sony shares could retrace in the near term but would eventually pick up where they left off, backed by the firm's healthy earnings and strong prospects.</p>
<p>Sony recently announced record group net profits for the business year to March 31, 1997 of 139.46 billion yen ($1.20 billion), a 2.6-fold rise from the previous year.</p>
<p>The firm, which is moving aggressively into new areas like digital satellite broadcasting, said it expects further growth to 160 billion yen ($1.37 billion) in the current year.</p>
<p>High-tech issues TDK Corp and Kyocera are also closing in on the 10,000-yen mark, and market sources said Sony's strength may eventually pull them up to that level.</p>
<p>TDK Corp rose as high as 9,150 yen on Friday, but slid to close 110 yen lower at 8,940. The shares hit a record high of 9,480 earlier this month.</p>
<p>Kyocera also retraced on Friday after setting a new 1997 high of 8,560 yen. The stock closed at 8,390, up 90 yen.</p>
