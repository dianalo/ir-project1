<p>Hundreds of defeated Zairean government troops handed their weapons over to victorious rebels on Monday in the newly-captured city of Kisangani.</p>
<p>Around 300 soldiers, some in tattered green uniform but others in civilian clothes, handed over their weapons at a military camp 10 km (six miles) outside Kisangani, Zaire's third largest city and a huge diamond and gold centre.</p>
<p>Kisangani, the biggest prize in this civil war, was captured on Saturday with little resistance from Zaire's ragged army backed by Serb mercenaries and Rwandan Hutu allies.</p>
<p>The surrendering soldiers showed no signs of ill-treatment, lounging at the camp where some were based prior to the retreat at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;We have put them (the soldiers) in these camps to teach them what our struggle is about. We will educate them and retrain them to decide which are fit to be part of the Alliance,&quot; said rebel commander Joseph Kabila.</p>
<p>Kabila is son of rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, whose Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) has so far seized a fifth of Zaire since the rebellion broke out in October.</p>
<p>There were no weapons to be seen at the base.</p>
<p>One Zairean soldier Jean-Philippe Mgunga said he decided to stay at the camp when other soldiers fled last weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;We want change. Why flee?,&quot; Mgunga said.</p>
<p>Kisangani residents wore white bandanas or stuck tiny white flags in their bicycles on Monday in a show of solidarity with the rebels.</p>
<p>The rebels have ruled out a ceasefire and instead vowed to take the conflict to the capital city Kinshasa, where many residents said they awaited the arrival of Kabila's guerrilla force.</p>
