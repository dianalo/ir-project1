<headline>Lawyers Title sees near-term margin pressure.</headline>
<dateline>RICHMOND, Va. 1997-04-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lawyers Title Corp, said Thursday it has invested funds to increase the bundle of services it brings to the marketplace and automate and these investments have put some near-term pressure on margins, but they are an essential part of the company's long-term competitive strategy.</p>
<p>The company said its efforts to grow and expand its other real estate related services also affected first quarter results.</p>
<p>These efforts were a continuation from the second half of 1996.  </p>
<p>The 1996 quarter included $2.2 million of capital gains, before taxes, while there were no significant capital gains in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Business volumes, as represented by the level of new open orders, are lower than they were a year ago,&quot; said chairman and chief executive Charles Foster Jr.  &quot;In view of this and the recent upward move in interest rates, we are watching our staffing levels and cost structure very carefully.&quot;</p>
<p>The company Thursday reported net income of $847,000, or $0.10 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 1997, compared to net income of $4.5 million, or $0.51 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 1996.</p>
<p>The operating margin, before claims and investment income, was 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 1997 compared with 6.5 percent in the first quarter of 1996.  The margin in 1997 was impacted by an increase in average agents' commission rates of 1.3 percent, which reflects continued competition for agency business.</p>
<p>Claims were 5.5 percent of operating revenue in the first quarter of 1997, virtually unchanged from the 5.4 percent of the first quarter of 1996.</p>
