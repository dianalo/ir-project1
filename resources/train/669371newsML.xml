<title>UK: UK's parliamentary Labour Party suspends member.</title>
<headline>UK's parliamentary Labour Party suspends member.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-18</dateline>

<p>Britain's ruling Labour party said on Wednesday it had suspended a senior member from the parliamentary party.</p>
<p>Labour Chief Whip (party manager) Nick Brown took the action against Bob Wareing because of allegations he had not properly registered a financial matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The chief whip has today exercised his powers to suspend Bob Wareing MP from the parliamentary Labour Party,&quot; a party spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The party has said we would always act quickly and decisively whenever there were serious allegations of misconduct. Today the chief whip used the powers that he had to take such an action and he did so without hesitation as soon as the allegations were presented to him.&quot;</p>
<p>No other details were immediately available.</p>
<p>Wareing, the 66-year-old member of parliament for Liverpool West Derby in northern England, said he recognised why Brown did what he did and why the matter was referred to Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Sir Gordon Downey, who will look into the allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;I regret any problems or embarrassment my actions may cause to my political colleagues, my constituency party and my constituents,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Brown took the action just hours after the parliamentary party voted to give him the power to suspend members, which means that rights and privileges, such as attending meetings, are withdrawn.</p>
<p>Mohammed Sarwar, Britain's first Moslem member of parliament, could face similar treatment. He has been accused of trying to bribe an election opponent.</p>
<p>Sarwar, who won a seat in Glasgow in the May 1 election that ousted the Conservatives after 18 years in power, says the 5,000 pounds ($8,179) he gave to a rival candidate was a loan and not a bribe.</p>
<p>He is due to attend a meeting on Thursday with a team set up by Labour's National Executive Committee to look into the case.</p>
