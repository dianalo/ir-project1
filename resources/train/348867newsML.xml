<dateline>TOKYO 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Japanese securities house Matsui Securities Co Ltd said on Friday it would cut by half its brokerage fees on stocks and convertible bonds traded over the counter, breaking the industry's custom of uniform fees.</p>
<p>The medium-size securities house said that it was determined to continue taking steps to swiftly deal with the liberalisation of Japan's financial markets.</p>
<p>According to rules set by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, securities houses can freely set brokerage fees within a certain range, but they currently charge uniform fees.</p>
<p>&quot;Some members of the industry criticised and pressured us for disturbing the order in the industry, but we have decided to help revitalise the market by taking steps as long as they meet the rules,&quot; Matsui said in a statement.</p>
<p>Matsui has moved aggressively in the area of reform in the last several years by trying to attract individual customers through newspaper ads, offering customers detailed reports on their transactions and cutting fees on the holding of securities for customers.</p>
