<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left Washington to return to Israel late on Monday after a tough two-hour meeting with President Bill Clinton failed to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.</p>
<p>The White House said Clinton offered new ideas to end an escalating spiral of violence over a new Israeli housing settlement project in Jerusalem, but no progress was reported after a session that a grim-faced president described as &quot;very specific, frank, candid and long.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu was tight-lipped about specifics, but told a packed American Israel Public Affairs Committee dinner before his departure that his talks in Washington were &quot;excellent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I met with President Clinton and Secretary (of State Madeleine) Albright and we had very good meetings. We had open talks, excellent talks,&quot; the prime minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have, I think, we have a sure friend in the White House -- actually two friends, the president and the vice president (Al Gore),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S., Israeli and Palestinian officials kept mum about specifics of new U.S. proposals aimed at keeping an outbreak of violence over new Jewish housing in East Jerusalem from derailing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Netanyahu agreed during his meetings on Monday with Clinton, Albright and negotiator Dennis Ross to consider &quot;specific American ideas&quot;, but he gave no details.</p>
<p>In remarks broadcast by Israel Radio, Netanyahu said Clinton &quot;raised some suggestions for reviving the diplomatic process in a later stage ... I won't get into details, but I can say the talk of pressures and threats and things like that did not come up at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Dore Gold told CNN's &quot;Crossfire&quot; the two reached a clear understanding that &quot;for this process to go forward you can't have a link between bulldozers and dynamite ... between settlements and violence. Violence has to be removed from the process.&quot;</p>
<p>PLO official Hasan Rahman, on the same programme, rejected suggestions that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sanctioned the suicide bombing last month that killed three Israelis. &quot;The first step is for Israel to stop building this illegal settlement and confiscating Palestinian land,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton said the next step was to discuss the U.S. proposals with the Palestinians, who are sending a negotiating team to Washington later this week.</p>
<p>&quot;After the meetings with the Palestinians later this week, then we will consider our next steps as we attempt to put these negotiations back on track,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>The urgency of the talks was underscored by continued violence in the West Bank, where a Jewish settler shot and wounded at least two Palestinians on Monday.</p>
<p>Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have ceased and clashes have been reported every day since Israel broke ground for new Jewish housing last month on Har Homa, a 6,500-home settlement on an East Jerusalem hill known as Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic.</p>
<p>Gold called the land &quot;a completely barren hill&quot; and said nothing in the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords prohibited construction of new settlements, but Rahman said Israel was &quot;unilaterally trying to determine the future of Jerusalem,&quot; which violated the spirit of the accords.</p>
<p>Administration officials say Albright may be sent to the region to follow up on Clinton's diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has proposed that he and Arafat reach a final peace agreement within six months, and said the goal may require an intensive three-way summit like the one that led to accords between Egypt and Israel.</p>
