<p>A native Brazilian Indian was critically injured on Sunday after five teenagers soaked his clothes with a flammable fluid and set him on fire in the capital Brasilia, a police official said.</p>
<p>Police Chief Valmir Alves de Carvalho said the youths, between 16 and 19 years old, drenched the man in a highly flammable liquid -- probably brake fluid -- while he slept at a bus stop.</p>
<p>&quot;They were kids coming home from partying ... it was a teenage prank,&quot; Alves said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>He said the boys, who were quickly rounded up by police after being identified by eye witnesses, confessed to the crime.</p>
<p>The victim was Galdino Jesus dos Santos, 45, of the Pataxo tribe in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia. Alves said the incident did not appear to be connected to the annual Indian Day festivities that were celebrated across Brazil on Saturday. &quot;They didn't even realise the man was an Indian,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A hospital spokeswoman said Santos had suffered severe burns all over his body and was in critical condition.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a very, very sick patient. The outlook is not good. I would say he is in God's hands,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>At least 20 Indians from several tribes gathered outside the hospital where dos Santos was receiving treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;They kill us out in the wild, now they kill us in the nation's capital,&quot; Pataxo Indian chief, Gerson Pataxo, said.</p>
<p>An Indian witch doctor, or &quot;paje,&quot; performed a ritual that Indians said was designed to drive away evil spirits.</p>
<p>Acting Justice Minister Milton Seligman told reporters at the hospital he was disgusted by the pointless act. &quot;I receive this news with the deepest indignation and feeling of profound shame,&quot; Seligman said.</p>
