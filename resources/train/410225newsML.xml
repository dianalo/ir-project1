<p>The Mexican government will applaud a U.S. decision on Friday to endorse it as an ally in the drug war but disagrees with the &quot;interventionist&quot; annual drug certification procedure, a government source told Reuters.</p>
<p>The source said the government would shortly release an official statement hailing the favourable U.S. decision as a recognition of Mexico's commitment to fighting drugs and of the results it had achieved.  </p>
<p>&quot;But, independent of the actual decision, we insist that the process of certification is unilateral and interventionist and that it does not help promote cooperation between governments,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Mexico's government will also insist in its official reaction that it was attacking drug-smuggling and drug-production because of its commitment to Mexican society and not because of any foreign pressure, he added.</p>
<p>Senior government officials were all unavailable for any immediate comment on the U.S. decision to recertify Mexico as a drug ally, announced earlier in Washington by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>At the presidency, officials said they did not plan to speak on the matter, saying any official statement would come from the Foreign Ministry.</p>
