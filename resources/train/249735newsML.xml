<headline>Buba's Hartmann says against open access to Target.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-11</dateline>

<p>Bundesbank board member Wendelin Hartmann on Wednesday reiterated the bank's opposition to central banks outside the planned European monetary union having unlimited access to Target, the cross-border settlement system for the euro.</p>
<p>Enabling central banks outside the euro currency region to take up intraday or overnight credit in euros would breach an unwritten rule of central banking -- that only the issuers of central bank money should be allowed to create money, Hartmann said according to the text of a speech he was due to deliver at a conference in Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>The euro member central banks must be able to control the creation of money, Hartmann said.</p>
<p>&quot;One must also note that member central banks will probably have to assume tasks which non-members will be exempt from, such as holding minimum reserve deposits for commercial banks,&quot; Hartmann said.</p>
<p>&quot;Access for non-participating central banks to euro credits would ... therefore not lead to equal treatment but rather to preferential treatment over the member countries,&quot; Hartmann said.</p>
<p>European monetary sources have said the debate about Target is so acrimonious there is little chance of a compromise between EMU &quot;ins&quot; and &quot;outs&quot; before the European Central Bank (ECB) is formed in 1998.</p>
<p>The Bank of England (BoE) argues that wider use of Target will enhance use of the single currency and ensure its success. It also says euro liquidity would be affected only if intra-day credit spilled over into overnight funding -- which could be prevented by stiff interest rate penalties.</p>
<p>Hartmann said he expected that the real advantages of Target lay in the speed and efficieny of the system, which all central banks, including those outside the euro area, could profit from.</p>
