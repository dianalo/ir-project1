<p>Germany's top television talk show host Thomas Gottschalk has signed an exclusive global contract with U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney Co , sister firm Buena Vista Productions International said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Buena Vista spokeswoman said the deal would start on January 1, 1998 and said the firm hoped to develop joint ideas with Gottschalk for the German and possibly the U.S. television markets.</p>
<p>Private German channel Sat.1, where Gottschalk currently hosts his Haus-Party (House Party) chat show, said it was interested in negotiating with Buena Vista over the programme, but it did not think the deal meant they would lose the show.</p>
<p>A Sat.1 spokeswoman said a decision would be reached in the next few weeks as to who would win rights to the show, which attracts up to five million viewers.</p>
<p>Sat 1. also said the new deal did not affect Gottschalk's presentation of their &quot;Kulmbacher Filmnaechte&quot; (Kulmbacher Film Nights).</p>
<p>Buena Vista said the host would also be able to continue to present his &quot;Wetten, dass... ?&quot; (Wanna Bet?) game show with public channel ZDF.</p>
