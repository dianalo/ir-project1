<p>Grain farmers in Poland and the Czech republic face sharp crop losses from two-week-old flooding across the region, government and trade sources said.</p>
<p>But while Polish and Czech farmers will bear the brunt of heavy rainfall in eastern Europe, those in Hungary and Romania may escape the worst effects.</p>
<p>Water levels were subsiding on Monday but emergency teams remained on alert to protect flood walls and clear away damage.</p>
<p>&quot;If it continues to rain....as the delayed harvest finally begins, we might see a fall in the quality of the crops and imports would be necessary,&quot; said Polish analyst Michal Kisiel.</p>
<p>He said the government-linked Agriculture Economics Institute assumed grain losses of 500,0000 to 800,000 tonnes, possibly reducing the 1997 grain crop to just 23.6 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Poland last year produced 24.7 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic's Chamber of Agriculture said floods could reduce the grain harvest by 500,000 tonnes to 6.5 million tonnes, as farmers could not get into waterlogged fields.</p>
<p>More rain and delays could cost another 200,000 to 500,000 tonnes. But with 1.3 million tonnes of grain in stock, Czech domestic demand of 6.5 million tonnes may still be satisfied.</p>
<p>Romania, which last week feared rains could lower the quality of its bread wheat crop, today said the adverse weather would not have much bearing on harvesting and exports.</p>
<p>&quot;This year, the good wheat crop has a quality which makes it fit for milling. Consequently it will be sought for export,&quot; said Trita Fanita, chairman of the Senate's agriculture commission, in a statement.</p>
<p>Romania expects to harvest 7.07 million tonnes of grain, almost double last year's crop, and export 2.4 million.</p>
<p>In Hungary, the wheat crop will be delayed by heavy rainfall and the traditional 60-40 ratio of high-quality bread wheat to wheat for animal feed could turn into 40-60 due to quality problems.</p>
<p>But the total grain crop may still be four to 4.5 million tonnes after 3.9 million in 1996 and maize, which likes hot and humid weather, could total more than 1996's six million tonnes.</p>
<p>Germany's key grain growing regions in the north have not been affected by heavy rain, which in many parts of the country brought welcome moisture to light soils.</p>
<p>&quot;Yields and qualities vary but there is no need to assume serious losses or damage,&quot; said the German farm price office.</p>
<p>Germany may still exceed its record 42.1 million tonnes harvest last year by 900,000 tonnes, analysts believe.</p>
<p>Brandenburg state in the east is battling with weakened dykes and riverbanks after heavy rainfall. But the low-lying Oderbruch area, which could be flooded if the Oder river burst its banks, accounts for only a small percentage of the grain area.</p>
<p>An analyst said Slovakia, along with the Czech Republic and Poland may need to import grain but Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria may beat western exporters by offering lower prices.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Russia were also likely suppliers of grains to the region and in Poland, a rapeseed shortage may be met by imports from Canada.</p>
