<p>Air cargo, including exports of cut flowers for Valentine's Day, was still moving in and out of Ecuador on Friday, despite Ecuador's political problems and work stoppages.</p>
<p>But air cargo executives said they were watching developments warily on Friday as the days before Valentine's Day are a peak time for air cargo out of Ecuador, a major producer of cut flowers, with many orders for roses and other blossoms.</p>
<p>Ecuador's Vice President Rosalia Arteaga on Sunday was appointed head of a caretaker government that brought an end to the political crisis sparked by the ouster of flamboyant leader Abdala Bucaram.</p>
<p>Legislators said Congress would meet on Tuesday to pass legislation allowing it to reappoint its leader, Fabian Alarcon, as president, with Arteaga returning to the vice-presidency.</p>
<p>Bucaram, dubbed &quot;El Loco&quot; -- &quot;madman&quot; -- for his sometimes bizarre behavior, stepped down early on Sunday just six months after he won office, driven out by a paralyzing strike and a revolt in the Congress.</p>
<p>A general strike that began on Wednesday slowed the shipping of flowers, and on Friday some exporters said they were having trouble getting flowers to the airport.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the flowers are getting hot, and you just cannot have that,&quot; William Surplus, vice president of Sunburst Farms, Miami, a major importer of flowers, said.</p>
<p>But Spohrer said the strike had no effect on Challenge and his shipments were arriving as scheduled.</p>
<p>&quot;We see no cause for concern at this time,&quot;  said B.F. Spohrer, president of Challenge Air Cargo. But, he added, &quot;We are watching it closely.&quot; Challenge has two daily flights out of Ecuador.</p>
<p>Last week an executive at Fine Air said that Fine had stopped flying to Ecuador for a few days because of the political problems. But the airline resumed its daily flight Friday morning without incident. -- Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+ 5017</p>
