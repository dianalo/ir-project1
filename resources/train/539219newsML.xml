<title>USA: Reynolds expert unsure what caused cancer.</title>
<headline>Reynolds expert unsure what caused cancer.</headline>

<text>
<p>A pathologist testified Friday at the trial of a wrongful death lawsuit against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co he could not conclude Jean Connor's cancer was caused by smoking or that it started in her lung.</p>
<p>Connor, whose family is suing Reynolds for allegedly manufacturing a dangerous product, smoked heavily from the time she was a teen-ager and died of lung cancer in October 1995 at age 49.</p>
<p>Dr. Sanford Barsky, a pathology professor at the UCLA Medical Center, showed jurors a series of slides of tissue samples taken from Connor and said he could not rule out that her cancer started in her lung but could not make that conclusion either.</p>
<p>&quot;Just because somebody smokes and gets a cancer...it doesn't follow from that that they're causally related,&quot; Barsky said. The testimony of Barsky, who was called to the witness stand by lawyers for Reynolds, appeared aimed at bolstering the company's contention that there was no proof Connor's cancer began in her lungs, as plaintiffs' lawyers have claimed.</p>
<p>The testimony contradicted that of a plaintiffs' expert witness earlier in the trial. Dr. Victor Roggli, a pathologist from Duke University, said he was virtually certain Connor was killed by lung cancer that began in her lung.</p>
