<p>Some MinFin bonds firmed on Tuesday following a rise in U.S. Treasuries and Bulgaria Bradys, dealers said.</p>
<p>    tranche		 Feb 11		  Feb 10</p>
<p>    1999 maturity (3)   86.63-86.88	   86.63-87.00</p>
<p>    2003 maturity (4)   62.75-63.00	   62.50-63.00</p>
<p>    2008 maturity (5)   43.75-44.13	   43.50-43.88</p>
<p>    2006 maturity (6)   49.63-50.00	   49.38-49.75</p>
<p>    2011 maturity (7)   36.88-37.25	   36.38-36.88</p>
<p>&quot;We are a bit higher, there is a lot of buying from London,&quot; a Moscow Narodny Bank dealer said. &quot;The long (U.S. Treasury) bond is firmer than yesterday and Bulgaria is rising.&quot;</p>
<p>Bulgaria moved into the Brady market spotlight on Tuesday as investors pushed prices up towards recent highs with more upside potential seen.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries in London recovered after selling in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The market edged up in the morning with most rise in tranches 5 and 7, but in the afternoon it calmed down, as orders were fulfilled,&quot; said an Avtobank dealer Alla Zakharova.</p>
<p>She said she saw most Western buying in tranches 5 and 7.</p>
<p>News that President Boris Yeltsin would not return to the Kremlin soon made no impact on the market, Zakharova said.</p>
<p>&quot;It caused nothing, but dealers' smiles,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin is recovering slowly from pneumonia, and will not return to the Kremlin quickly, his press secretary said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Zakharova forecast tranche 5 would soon hit 44.00 at bid.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is almost ready for that,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Moscow Narodny Bank dealer said the market was waiting for the U.S. jobless claims, retail sales, business inventories and PPI index to be released on Thursday and Friday.</p>
