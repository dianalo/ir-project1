<p>Shipbuilding and engineering group IHC Caland NV said on Monday it was confident to increase its earlier forecast for the whole of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Profit after taxation for IHC Caland for 1996 is now expected to increase by approximately 21 percent to not less than 91 million guilders (3.63 guilders per share),&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>IHC said in April it expected the 1996 full-year net profit from ordinary operations to rise to at least 86 million guilders from 1995's 75.3 million.  </p>
<p>In the first half of 1996 net profit fell to 34.9 million guilders, down from 36.6 million in the year-ago period and below the 37.5-47.2 million range expected by analysts.</p>
<p>IHC Caland said its first-half net was depressed by unusually high capacity utilisation which caused higher costs. Delivered orders now totalled 281 million guilders, down from 378 million in the first half of 1995 and 928 million in the whole of last year.</p>
<p>The company said the major part of its orders would be completed in the second half of the year and added it only posted profits on orders after delivery or completion.  </p>
<p>IHC Caland said all divisions had contributed to its profits in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>It added it had booked new orders totalling 745 million guilders in this period, compared to 1.86 billion in the whole of 1995.</p>
