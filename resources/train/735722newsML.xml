<title>MEXICO: Mexican electoral body receives election complaints.</title>
<headline>Mexican electoral body receives election complaints.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-07-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico's Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) said on Wednesday it was investigating at least 200 complaints concerning different alleged irregularities in the July 6 mid-term elections.</p>
<p>&quot;To date we have received at least 200 challenges, related to diverse irregularities,&quot; IFE executive secretary Felipe Solis Acero told reporters. He did not detail the specific challenges.</p>
<p>He noted the number was lower than the 1,200 complaints it received during the 1994 elections.</p>
<p>Mexicans voted on July 6 for 500 new deputies in the lower house of Congress, for 32 of 128 senators in the upper house, for six state governors, and for a new mayor in Mexico City.</p>
<p>In the national congressional vote, the PRI lost its absolute majority in the lower house, and overall it suffered its worst electoral defeat in 68 years of power.</p>
<p>The elections were widely considered the cleanest in Mexico's recent history.</p>
<p>The only state where there have been significant fraud complaints is Campeche, in southeast Mexico, where the opposition has contested the victory of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate for governor.</p>
