<title>USA: Emerging market debts mixed in pre-holiday trade.</title>
<headline>Emerging market debts mixed in pre-holiday trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Latin American debts were mixed in a brief trading session ahead of the three-day U.S. Veterans Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The Public Securities Association recommended that U.S. Treasury and related markets close at 1400 EST/1900 GMT on Friday. The markets will stay closed on Monday and trading resumes on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said most of the activities in the morning were related to switching out of Brazil and, to a less extent, Argentina into Mexico.  </p>
<p>Soft Treasury prices sapped some energy out of the market, but without overt impact, they said.</p>
<p>U.S. investors apparently warmed to Mexico after Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz unveiled the 1997 budget guidelines.</p>
<p>Arturo Porzecanski, chief economist of Americas at ING Baring, said the numbers were by and large in line with expectations.</p>
<p>The 15-percent annual inflation projection is slightly lower than his firm's 17 percent, he said.  </p>
<p>The exchange rate assumption of 8.53 pesos per dollar for 1997 was &quot;a bit on the bearish side,&quot; but the market took it in stride, said Tulio Vera, emerging market fixed income strategist at Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>At 1400 EST/1900 GMT, Mexican pars MX625L19=RR were 1/8 lower at 71-3/4 bid and the UMS-26 MXUMS=RR bonds were 1/4 lower at 102-1/4.</p>
<p>In a market adjusting to slipping Treasuries, Brazil bore most of the brunt, said a Brady trader, noting that the stalled reform and deteriorating trade deficits were persistent worries.  </p>
<p>Brazil's &quot;C&quot; bonds BR8D14=RR were 7/8 weaker at 70-3/8.</p>
<p>Trading in other emerging market debts was muted. Debt prices of Russia all maintained a firm tone inspite the U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Russian Vneshekonombank dollar loans RUVNUSLNS=RR were unchanged at 78-3/4 and Ministry of Finance 3 RU3E99=RR were 3/8 firmer at 81-7/8.</p>
