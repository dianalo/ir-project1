<headline>NZ ranked 10th in competitiveness survey.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Zealand has been ranked 10th of 46 nations in a Swiss-based survey of competitiveness, ahead of both Japan and Australia, the New Zealand Press Association reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But while New Zealand rated well for &quot;people&quot; factors such as quality of life, its domestic economy performance plunged 17 places from 10 last year to 27 in 1997.</p>
<p>The United States topped the annual survey released by Switzerland's International Institute for Management Development, with Singapore second and Hong Kong third.  </p>
<p>New Zealand beat off both Japan, ranked 11 and the United Kingdom at 12, while Australia managed 17th place.</p>
<p>New Zealand's performance has remained steady since 1994, always finishing between 11th and ninth place.</p>
<p>More than 240 criteria are considered for the survey, divided into eight sections -- the domestic economy, internationalisation, government, finance, infrastructure, management, science and technology. The latest figures are a nine-month update on the 1996 result.  </p>
<p>New Zealand's best category was government, where it finished third. That factor considers government domestic and foreign debt levels, budget surplus forecasts, tax rates, the political system and government involvement in the economy.</p>
<p>The domestic economy section considers gross domestic product figures, investment, production and industry growth rates, retail sales, inflation and cost of living comparisons.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for IMD told NZPA the major reason for New Zealand's drop in that section were worsening GDP figures. New Zealand, ranked 16th last year for its GDP per capita and real GDP growth rates, finished in 28th place this year.  </p>
<p>New Zealand's other scores were internationalisation 23; finance 15; infrastructure 14; management 9; science and technology 17 and people 7.</p>
<p>IMD listed New Zealand, Luxembourg (ranked 13) and Ireland (15) as small, but brilliant stars in the list.</p>
<p>The survey results, traditionally released once a year, are now being updated each quarter, with the March figures to be compared with the last full annual survey results released last May.</p>
<p>Of the 244 criteria, 63 percent have been fully updated since May.  </p>
