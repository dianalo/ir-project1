<p>The Eritrean-based Sudanese opposition alliance renewed threats against the Sudan government on Tuesday after denouncing what it called a plot to kill President Isaias Aferwerki.</p>
<p>The Islamic-backed military government in Khartoum denied the charge.</p>
<p>&quot;The bloody and terrorist NIF (National Islamic Front) regime cannot be improved but should be removed root and branch by all means possible if peace, democracy and respect for human rights are to be achieved,&quot; said an opposition National Democratic Alliance statement read by &quot;foreign secretary&quot; Mansour Khalid.</p>
<p>&quot;Expect to see more intensified military action in the near future,&quot; said Sudan People's Liberation army leader John Garang, adding rebels were fighting near Dali, northwest of Juba.</p>
<p>Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae told a news conference on Monday in the Eritrean capital Asmara that Sudan plotted to kill Afewerki last November through an agent he named as Captain Nesredin Babakar Aba Al Khairat.</p>
<p>Haile said Khartoum had planned to carry out the assassination through the agent it had infiltrated into NDA ranks.</p>
<p>&quot;After checking the list of officers in the (Sudanese) armed forces and other regular forces, no name, as alleged, of Nasredin Babakar Aba Al Khairat has been found,&quot; the official Sudan News Agency quoted Mustafa Osman Ismail, a minister at the foreign ministry, as saying.</p>
<p>Ismail described the Eritrean allegation as &quot;mere fabrications, (through) which the Eritrean regime seeks to absolve itself of the involvement of its organs in recent subversive attempts detected by the Sudanese authorities&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The fabricated Eritrean statement coincides with the plot of the Eritrean regime, supported by foreign forces, to attack Sudan,&quot; Ismail said.</p>
<p>He was referring to jail sentences passed earlier this month on 19 people for planning to attack vital installations in Port Sudan in a bid to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>Ismail challenged the Asmara government to try the alleged Sudanese officer in public.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Democratic Alliance renews its warning to those countries and organizations that financially and militarily support the NIF regime,&quot; Khalid said.</p>
<p>&quot;It further warns those concerned that activities emanating from those investments shall be considered legitimate military targets and those concerned shall be responsible for whatever consequences that may ensue,&quot; Khalid told a news conference.</p>
<p>The conference followed a three-day NDA meeting.</p>
<p>Khartoum has accused Asmara of helping the Sudanese rebels who launched an offensive from close to the Eritrean border in January. Eritrea denies the charge.</p>
<p>The Asmara-based NDA is made up of Sudanese rebel groups in exile fighting to overthrow the government in Khartoum.</p>
