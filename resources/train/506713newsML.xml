<title>USA: Blue-chip stocks post strongest rally in three weeks.</title>
<headline>Blue-chip stocks post strongest rally in three weeks.</headline>

<p>Blue-chip stocks moved solidly higher Monday, posting their strongest rally in three weeks on better-than-expected earnings reports from several pacesetting companies.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 60.21 points at 6,451.90, its largest gain since a 101-point surge on March 24. Last week, the market was in a bearish mood as it fell nearly 135 points on interest rate worries.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues still led advances 1,425 to 1,037 on moderate volume of 406 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts said nervous investors found some relief when a series of leading multinational companies, including Coca-Cola Co. and General Motors Corp., announced first-quarter profits that exceeded Wall Street's estimates.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's rally suggests select stocks with good earnings may put some bounce back in the market,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned, however, that market sentiment remained guarded, particularly with key inflation data due in Tuesday's Consumer Price Index.</p>
<p>&quot;In general, results are coming in better than expected, but we've still got a test tomorrow in the CPI,&quot; said Charles White, managing director at Avatar Associates. &quot;Today certainly doesn't mean we're out of the woods.&quot;</p>
<p>The looming report on inflation at the retail level held the bond market in check. The Treasury's 30-year bond was flat and its yield held at Friday's close of 7.17 percent.</p>
<p>The quiet bond market left stock traders free to focus on the generally favourable earnings news.</p>
<p>Stocks were rattled Friday by news that wholesale prices in March chalked up an unexpected 0.4 percent rise in the so-called core rate, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs.</p>
<p>In addition to Coke, which rallied 2 to 55-3/4, and GM, which gained 1/2 to 53-1/2, Travelers Inc. also produced a favourable earnings surprise and climbed 2 to 48-3/8.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results provided a much-needed psychological boost for beleaguered investors, who had watched the Dow dive nearly 10 percent over the last five weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;This market has been groping for a near-term bottom,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. &quot;It looks like we may have found one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But there are definitely people still sitting this out,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect this market to remain extremely choppy.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors got more favourable news after the close when Intel Corp. said its first-quarter profits more than doubled to $1.98 billion from $894 million in the same period last year. The per-share earnings of $2.20 per share beat analysts' estimates and hit a so-called &quot;whisper number&quot; that had been circulating around Wall Street.</p>
<p>Intel jumped to 135 in after-hours trading after a regular session that lifted the shares 3-1/4 to 133-1/4.</p>
<p>&quot;Intel's number is an important one for the psychology of the market,&quot; Ackerman said, adding that the company was one of a handful that set the tone for technology shares.</p>
<p>Technology stocks generally turned in a solid performance, but one notable exception was Novellus Systems Inc.,  which tumbled 22-1/4 to 53 after the company announced it had lost a patent infringement trial. Novellus also reported first quarter earnings that were down sharply from a year ago.</p>
<p>Among other issues, Shaw Group Inc. slid 8-5/8 to 13 after warning of weak third and fourth quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Container carrier APL Ltd. jumped 8-1/4 to 29-3/4 after agreeing to be acquired by Singapore shipping firm Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. in a deal worth $825 million, or $33.50 per APL share.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index rose 9.51 points to 1,216.41.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 6.08 points to 743.73. The American Stock Exchange index fell 3.16 to 552.97.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.02 to 391.49. The average share was up 20 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,097.532 up 37.563 or 0.53 percent.</p>
