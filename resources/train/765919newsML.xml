<p>The PX50's most heavily capitalised share SPT Telecom pushed the index up 0.41 percent to 513.8 on Wednesday after SPT released first half financial results which were welcomed by analysts and dealers.</p>
<p>SPT closed up 80 crowns, 2.1 percent, to 3,880.</p>
<p>&quot;We...remain bullish about the stock as the main value drivers continue to do well. Revenue is up sharply, EBTDA surged by 38 percent, eficiency and productivity further improved,&quot; an ABM AMRO Hoare Govett report on the results said.</p>
<p>&quot;...Last but not least there is still upside potential in the shares. Target price CZK4,250,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, SPT posted first half after-tax consolidated profits of 2.79 billion crowns versus 2.82 billion in the same period last year, according to international accounting standards.</p>
<p>However, revenues rose to 18.923 billion crowns from 15.097 billion and analysts said the fall in net profits was mainly due to higher depreciation.</p>
<p>Although there was not much activity in SPT on the automatic trading system, there were heavy block trades in the issue.</p>
