<p>Vietnam back-pedalled on Tuesday from its vow to build a huge oil refinery without foreign help and conceded that financing for the controversial plant was far from wrapped up.</p>
<p>With a front-page flourish, official media announced on Monday that Hanoi had dropped plans to work with foreign partners and would start building the 130,000-barrel per day plant on its own before the end of this year for a 2001 start-up.</p>
<p>But state oil firm Petrovietnam said on Tuesday that the door was still open for foreign firms to help build the $1.5 billion plant at Dung Quat, a remote and undeveloped coastal site.</p>
<p>Western analysts said the Dung Quat refinery ranked along with a clutch of politically inspired mega-projects which are high on prestige for the nation, but low on economic viability.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's totally pie in the sky. It will never happen,&quot; said a senior Western economist in Hanoi.</p>
<p>&quot;The only reason to do it is national pride, it has no economic value in terms of allocating scarce economic resources.&quot;</p>
<p>Dung Quat has been mired in controversy since 1995, when France's Total SA walked away from the project, claiming it made no sense to put a refinery in a poverty-hit area hundreds of kilometres north of the country's oilfields and chief consumption base.</p>
<p>A consortium of foreign firms stepped in to replace Total, but the group broke up earlier this year after Petrovietnam rejected its demand for greater commercial and financial incentives.</p>
<p>Vietnam kept talks going with two members of the group, South Korea's LG Croup and Malaysia's state oil firm Petronas, but Monday's announcement that Petrovietnam would go it alone appeared to rule out even their participation.</p>
<p>However, Do Van Ha, General Manager for International Cooperation at Petrovietnam, told Reuters that the company was &quot;ready to talk to anybody, not just LG and Petronas&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked about financing, he declined to give details because the picture was changing all the time, though said it was clear that foreign funding would be needed.</p>
<p>The Vietnam News said on Monday that the government would fund up to $600 million, while $400 million would be raised through issuing debenture bonds and deferred bank loans from abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The remaining $500 million will be mobilised from different sources,&quot; it added, giving no details.</p>
<p>Bradley Babson, the World Bank Representative in Hanoi, said Vietnam could not afford a Dung Quat right now -- the limited funds available in state coffers should be spent on infrastructure projects such as power generation and those which create jobs.</p>
<p>Hanoi is not unused to negative comments by foreigners about its refinery plan.</p>
<p>A Petrovietnam official stood up at an oil conference last year to ask an analyst taking questions what advice he could give Vietnam on building Dung Quat. &quot;Don't do it,&quot; came the reply.</p>
<p>The Hawaii-based East-West Center, a research group partly funded by the U.S. government, argues that with major refining capacity planned in Asia for 2000-2005, more brand new refineries would not be justifiable without the right incentives.</p>
<p>In a report, the think-tank forecast basic refining profit margins of no more than $2 a barrel between 1995 and 2005 and margins from more sophisticated hydroskimming operations not exceeding $8 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;These margins would be good for expansions or upgrading, but not for standalone refineries unless they received adequate incentives,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Diplomats said that, viewed from a purely commercial angle, Dung Quat makes little sense. But the government's unwillingness to put the project on hold reflected a strong will to develop a poor region of the country and ensure national economic security.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it would be far cheaper to buy petroleum products abroad,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;But in the minds of Vietnamese (officials), the hardship of economic sanctions are still very real.&quot;</p>
