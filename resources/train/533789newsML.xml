<p>A rise in confidence about Japan's economy could lead to concerns about price rises, Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita was quoted a saying on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall prices are stable except for the impact from the sales tax increase, but potential concern about prices of goods may arise if confidence in the prospects for the economy increases,&quot; Matsushita was quoted as saying in a meeting between BOJ officials and officials of the Japan Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren).</p>
<p>The remarks were quoted by a senior Keidanren official who briefed reporters on the meeting.  </p>
<p>Matsushita said firmness in Japan's economy is increasing due to brisk exports and brisk domestic demand.</p>
<p>&quot;A negative impact of the sales tax increase is seen in some areas, but economic conditions would get better if uncertainties surrounding the tax increase and discontinuation of special income tax cuts were gone,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Japan raised the sales tax to five percent from three pecent on April 1 and decided not to continue a two trillion yen special income cut in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Asked if Matsushita made reference to the BOJ's monetary policy, the Keidanren official said Matsushita did not touch on the BOJ's interest rate policy.</p>
<p>Asked by a Keidanren participant if a slowdown in growth in Japan's money supply causes problems for the economy, Matsushita had said there should be no problems when movement in M2 plus CDs, the nation's broadly defined money supply, in the January-March quarter were taken into account.</p>
<p>Matsushita was quoted as adding that uncertainties surrounding the sales tax increase were reflected in Japanese stock prices.</p>
