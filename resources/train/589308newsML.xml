<p>Paris St Germain, with neither a trophy to parade nor fans to back them, put their last aspirations of the season on the line in the cauldron of their arch-enemies Marseille's Velodrome ground on Saturday.</p>
<p>Marseille want to end a disappointing season on a high note with a victory that would damage the Parisians' hopes of second place in the first division and a place in the European Cup next season alongside champions Monaco.</p>
<p>The former European champions, coming back more slowly than they would have liked after their fall from grace under Bernard Tapie, scent a wounded lion in a PSG side who relinquished the Cup Winners' Cup to Barcelona in Rotterdam on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They've left a part of their soul in that match, they won't be at their best,&quot; Marseille coach Gerard Gili said.</p>
<p>&quot;Having lived that kind of situation, I know how hard it is to re-motivate the players. Even if they are real professionals, there are psychological parameters which a trainer has no influence over.&quot;</p>
<p>For the die-hard Velodrome fans, the match is no different to the days when the two sides fought tooth and nail for the league title.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can make them lose the second place in the table we're not going to let the chance pass,&quot; a member of the Marseille ultras said before the only all ticket match of the season at the Velodrome.</p>
<p>There will be about 22,500 spectators at the Velodrome, but no official party of PSG fans travelling down from the capital. The Marseille police have been unable to guarantee security and keeping the rival fans apart at a ground undergoing World Cup alterations.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the existing rivalry, it's the match of the season,&quot; said defender Christophe Galtier.</p>
<p>&quot;It's also the last match at the Velodrome for some of the current players. We must honour the Marseille jersey to the end. A win would erase the disappointments of the season.&quot;</p>
<p>Marseille have languished in mid-table all season, their first back in the top flight after two in the second division following relegation, first over the Valenciennes match-rigging scandal and then for financial irregularities.</p>
<p>They are currently 11th and have only one match left to avoid ending the season without an away victory when they travel to Lyon on the last day of the championship on May 24.</p>
<p>Marseille captain Jean-Philippe Durand, who looks set to retire at the end of the season, is wary of a PSG backlash after their Rotterdam defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;They still have an important challenge, to secure second place in the table. It's sure that they'll come to take the three points,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>PSG's Jerome Leroy said: &quot;Let's take this match as a second European cup final.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to hold on for three hours to succeed, so we forget the fatigue,&quot; he said referring to the two remaining games.</p>
<p>Coach Ricardo said: &quot;There's no excuse for not going into this match with the right attitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Both sides have one player suspended, midfielder Vincent Guerin of PSG and Marseille defender Hamada Jambay.</p>
<p>Marseille also have Italian centre-back Ivan Franceschini out with injury and midfielders Ludovic Asuar and Yordan Lechkov doubtful.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian international, not a successful signing, is one of a large proportion of the squad likely to move on as Marseille re-build for next season and his agent has been in the city this week for talks with player and club.</p>
<p>It could also be Xavier Gravelaine's last match for Marseille. The 15-goal striker is suspended for the Lyon match next weekend.</p>
