<headline>INSIGHT- T-bond futures rally could be short-lived.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-04</dateline>

<p>U.S. T-bond futures could experience further gains short-term, but some technical analysts are not convinced the bullish tone will last.</p>
<p>Daily stochastics are currently close to overbought and the K-D spread has narrowed. As a result, Jim Grauer, president of Omnitrage, expects a bearish downcross to occur within the next few days.</p>
<p>In contrast, weekly stochastics already reversed a previous downcross and K is barely above D, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But with the daily so high, and about to cross down, you have to ask yourself, does this rally really have the legs to take us up another four or five points? My feeling is no.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this is the beginning of a major secular turn in the market. The market still has to work out a number of imponderables in the market, first and foremost being do we have wage pressure or don't we,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In the interim, Grauer expects the market's gains to be limited to 112-16/32, possibly into December. The downside potential for the contract will be limited to 100-00, he forecast.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we don't see par, we're going to see into December and January a rather lengthy trading range,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>However, other analysts were more optimistic.</p>
<p>A close above 110-29/32, in the December contract, would be very bullish near-term, said Rick Santelli, vice president of futures trading at Rand Financial Services.</p>
<p>Beyond that, he believes the highest frequency price area will occur at 111-26/32, over the next few days, with resistance at 112-18/32. Similarly, a close above 94.27 in March eurodollars would be bullish, with further resistance at 94.41 and then at 94.49, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But I really think that the eurodollar market's going to be much less aggressive than the long end of the market, if we get good closes today,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>As fears of inflation ebb, &quot;the bond market could potentially be explosive to the upside and I think that you'll just get more bang for your dollar further down on the curve,&quot; he said.</p>
