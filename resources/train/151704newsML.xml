<headline>Dollar nosedives in Europe as key prop crumbles.</headline>

<p>Dollar/mark crashed through key technical support in early Europe, stealing the limelight from dollar/yen, which had raced to fresh 3-1/2-year highs overnight.</p>
<p>Analysts said the U.S. unit had taken a hit from comments by Germany's six leading economic research institutes that a slight tightening was possible if M3 growth stuck above target levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Outside of a weak yen, you haven't got a strong dollar environment at the moment,&quot; said Chris Tinker, chief economist, treasury at Standard Chartered Bank in London.  </p>
<p>The dollar began the European session around 1.5176/81 marks but after wearing away key chart support at 1.5160 -- the low for the past three trading days -- it sped downhill.</p>
<p>It plunged to a low of 1.5080 before settling at 1.5105/12 by 0900 GMT, down from Monday's European close of 1.5174/81.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark had already lagged dollar/yen's sharp rally, demoralised by comments from Bundesbank officials suggesting that German monetary easing was off the agenda for now.</p>
<p>The German institutes said current interest rate levels were appropriate, but the Bundesbank should not shrink from tightening if M3 growth continued to overshoot targets.  </p>
<p>The slump in dollar/mark wiped some of the gloss off dollar/yen, which romped to a new 42-month high of 114.88 in the Far East overnight.</p>
<p>The dollar slipped to 113.91/114.01 yen by 0911 GMT from 114.10/20 in late Europe yesterday.</p>
<p>Investors' appetite for yield, an uncertain Japanese political climate and bearish technicals have all helped depress the yen across the board in recent days.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a scramble going on for yield and Japan is still the obvious funding currency,&quot; said Ian Amstad, international economist at Bankers Trust in London.  </p>
<p>&quot;The view is that Japan isn't particularly bothered by a weaker yen -- it seems they'd prefer 120 (per dollar) to 100,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Japanese Finance Minister Wataro Kubo said overnight that the yen's current movements reflected fundamentals and the situation did not warrant special attention. The dollar was still in the process of orderly reversal, he added.</p>
<p>That followed an assertion by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that he was not concerned about the dollar's recent rise.</p>
<p>The yen drew some support, however, from data showing Japanese industrial production rose 1.0 percent in September.  </p>
<p>That compared favourably with August's month-on-month fall of 2.3 percent and economists' average forecasts of a 1.0 percent September drop. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said output was on a gradual upward trend.</p>
<p>The market is now waiting for the week's flood of U.S. data to be unleashed. It begins at 1330 GMT with the much-watched third-quarter employment cost index.</p>
<p>&quot;(U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan) Greenspan has recently emphasised the importance of these data as an indicator of underlying wage pressure,&quot; said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN AMRO in London.  </p>
<p>&quot;The data release is rather important ahead of the November 13 FOMC meeting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other important U.S. releases this week include October consumer confidence at 1500 GMT and Wednesday's third-quarter GDP and Fed beige book. The big focus is Friday's payrolls, an indicator which has wreaked havoc on asset markets in the past.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the mark streaked to an early high of 75.64, its best level in more than three and a half years. Sterling, a sparkling performer of late, mimicked the dollar and retreated against the mark, but cable held steady.</p>
