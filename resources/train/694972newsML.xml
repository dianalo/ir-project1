<p>Taiwan's main political parties, though sharply divided over the island's future, have one thing in common -- they say the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula being pioneered in Hong Kong is inapplicable in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The parties -- from pro-reunification to pro-independence -- have hailed the end of 156 years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong but called the concept of local autonomy under communist China's rule unacceptable for Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan President and ruling Nationalist Party chairman Lee Teng-hui has called Hong Kong's return to China &quot;a delightful thing&quot;. The fledgling New Party, the staunchest advocate of unification among Taiwan parties, calls Hong Kong's return &quot;a glorious page for the Chinese nation&quot;.</p>
<p>Even the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party described the handover as &quot;positive&quot;.</p>
<p>But none of them want the same for Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;No people in Taiwan will accept 'one country, two systems' under which Taiwan becomes a local government of the People's Republic of China,&quot; New Party leader Chen Kuei-miao told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Beijing, which has viewed Taiwan as a rebel-held province since a 1949 civil war split it from the mainland, says the long-negotiated returns of Hong Kong and Macau in 1999 leave Taiwan as the only territory still awaiting &quot;reunification with the motherland&quot;.</p>
<p>China says its handling of Hong Kong's &quot;one country, two systems&quot; experience should reassure Taiwan of its own future under mainland sovereignty.</p>
<p>Under the system agreed by Britain and China in 1984, Hong Kong can maintain its capitalist systems for 50 years after it reverts to Beijing's control on July 1.</p>
<p>Beijing has pledged that Taiwan would have even greater autonomy if it accepted &quot;one country, two systems&quot;.</p>
<p>But President Lee flatly rejects Beijing's scheme for Taiwan's return. Lee's exiled Republic of China government favours an eventual reunion under democracy.</p>
<p>The Nationalist government, which has embraced multiparty democracy, says reunification is impossible before the Communist Party drops its political monopoly and allows democratic pluralism.</p>
<p>Chen said his New Party proposes that Taipei and Beijing should first reunite under a federation so Taiwan can continue to maintain its own defence and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>As for the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, party lawmaker and Hong Kong affairs expert Lin Tso-hsui said Taiwan already was an independent sovereign nation, unlike Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;Taiwan is not a colony of any country. It rules itself. It has its own democracy,&quot; Lin said.</p>
<p>&quot;'One country, two systems' is poison coated with sugar. Whether or not we will accept the offer? I'd say: No, thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>Democratic Progressive spokeswoman Sisy Chen was extremely skeptical about the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; model, saying it was impossible to integrate communism with capitalism.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the first time in human history that they try to push these two ideologies together,&quot; the independence-minded Sisy Chen told Reuters. &quot;It would be a very dangerous experiment. It's a fatal experiment.&quot;</p>
<p>If the formula succeeds in Hong Kong, Beijing's communists could find themselves with an even bigger problem at home as mainland cities such as Shanghai start to clamour for Hong Kong-style liberties, Chen said.</p>
<p>If the capitalism-under-communism experiment fails, even more Taiwan people will opt for independence, politicians said.</p>
<p>&quot;If Hong Kong's economy declines and freedom and democracy go backward after the handover, this will trigger Taiwan people's independence sentiment and boost the separatist movement,&quot; Chen of the New Party warned.</p>
<p>The party leaders differed over Taiwan's future relations with Hong Kong and China.</p>
<p>The Nationalists and New Party said Taipei should keep close contacts with Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Democratic Progressive Party said Hong Kong should be treated cautiously and as a foreign country.</p>
