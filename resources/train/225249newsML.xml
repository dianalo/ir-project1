<title>GERMANY: Lufthansa Cargo drops Thai subsidiary plan.</title>
<headline>Lufthansa Cargo drops Thai subsidiary plan.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lufthansa Cargo AG (LCAG) has effectively abandoned plans to set up a cargo airline subsidiary with Thai Airways International.</p>
<p>LCAG chairman Wilhelm Althen said recent developments at the Thai airline meant there was little chance of the long-planned joint venture going ahead.</p>
<p>Thai Airways sources told Reuters on November 8 that the airline would not proceed with plans separate Thai Sairways cargo operations into a separate company.</p>
<p>This followed a two-day strike by cargo handling workers against the plan over fears of job losses.</p>
<p>&quot;The Thai government has decided that the separation will not take place,&quot; Althen told a Frankfurt press conference on Friday.</p>
<p>As a result, Lufthansa Cargo no longer expected its planned joint venture with Thai Airways to happen in the near future, he added.</p>
<p>The two airlines launched a freight co-operation agreement in 1994 under which joint freighter services would be extended and a joint subsidiary airline was planned.</p>
<p>But Althen stressed that Lufthansa Cargo would continue its successful existing joint freighter service between Frankfurt and Bangkok with Thai Airways.</p>
<p>He told Reuters later that freighter co-operation with Korean Air Lines could be extended to operating hub services between Frankfurt, Sharjah and Seoul from next summer.</p>
<p>This would be similar to the co-operation with Singapore Airlines under which the two airlines co-ordinate freighter flights into Sharjah for Europe-Asia consignments, he explained.</p>
<p>Althen told the news conference joint sales could in future be launched with other cargo airline partners but product development was the first priority under the airline's new logistics strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have anti-trust immunity with United Airlines and I expect that will gradually expand to the others,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;There is no need to go to joint sales in the first step. In the first step we are pooling capacity.&quot;</p>
<p>Lufthansa and UAL have launched a joint sales pilot scheme and plan joint sales and marketing worldwide next year.</p>
<p>Althen said Lufthansa Cargo did not always have to reach agreements with airlines which had passenger agreements with Deutsche Lufthansa.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no pressure to take the passenger partners as the cargo partners. If we confirm that it does not work (with the passenger partners), then we will turn to others,&quot; he said. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017</p>
