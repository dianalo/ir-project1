<p>Bombay share prices finished mixed on Monday in thin volume hit by a holiday abroad where foreign fund managers are based, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was directionless,&quot; said broker Sunil Kothari. &quot;Activity was very dull. There were few participants and price movements were restricted.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index ended 3.90 points higher at a provisional 3,435.30 after rising to 3,460.59.</p>
<p>The 50-stock NSE index closed 2.95 points lower at a provisional 1,010.05.</p>
<p>The 500-share CRISIL index slipped 0.79 points to a provisional 686.02.</p>
<p>Kothari said a market holiday in London and Hong Kong affected volume.</p>
<p>Local funds like state-run insurance firms bought and sold small lots of shares. Traders said they were given buy orders by some institutions at price limits which could not be executed because the shares stayed up.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is waiting for someone to press the trigger,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The consensus is that we'll see gains this week.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said expectations the government will make changes to a controversial minimum corporate tax before the proposal is passed by parliament next month was likely to pep up sentiment.</p>
<p>Parliament resumed on Monday after the summer break.</p>
<p>Scootermaker Bajaj Auto gained 4.25 rupees to 1,018.25 buoyed by news that its turnover was up 29 percent at 11.34 billion rupees in the first months of 1996/97 (April-March).</p>
<p>ACC gained 22.50 to 2,121, Ranbaxy 5.25 to 615.25, M&amp;M 3.75 to 352 and TISCO 1.25 to 189.50.</p>
<p>Reliance dropped 4.50 to 209.50 and SBI 1.0 to 266.25.</p>
