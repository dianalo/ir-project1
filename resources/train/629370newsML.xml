<p>The conservative Shi'ite Moslem clergyman defeated in Iran's presidential election was chosen again on Sunday as speaker of parliament, signalling president-elect Mohammad Khatami could face a tough time ahead.</p>
<p>Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the conservative clerical establishment's candidate for the presidency, was re-elected to his third one-year term as speaker of the 270-seat Majlis. Nateq-Nouri, the only candidate for speaker, was re-elected by 211 deputies compared with 146 last year.</p>
<p>A threatened challenge by the dominant conservatives' centrist opponents, who had spoken of nominating former interior minister Abdullah Nouri, failed to appear. He had secured 92 votes in a challenge last year.</p>
<p>In the May 23 presidential poll Nateq-Nouri won only 25 percent of the popular vote compared with Khatami's landslide 69 percent of 29 million votes cast.</p>
<p>Iranian analysts said Nateq-Nouri's re-election as speaker could be a problem for Khatami, a moderate cleric who must submit his cabinet to parliament for confirmation.</p>
<p>Iran News daily said the election would have a decisive impact on Khatami's cabinet. The political faction that won the speakership would dominate the cabinet, it said.</p>
<p>Khatami, who takes over from outgoing President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in August, has not disclosed who is in the running for ministerial posts.</p>
