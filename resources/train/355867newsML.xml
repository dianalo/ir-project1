<headline>Gajoen Kanko fails to pay bills again--credit firm.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-02-04</dateline>

<p>Gajoen Kanko KK, a Japanese hotel operator, has failed to pay bank bills for the second time, with debts totalling 9.88 billion yen, Japanese credit research company Teikoku Databank said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A second failure to pay bills is regarded in Japanese business practice as effectively a bankruptcy.  </p>
<p>Officials at Gajoen Kanko were not immediately available to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Gajoen Kanko shares were put under surveillance by the Tokyo Stock Exchange last September after the hotel operator admitted that it had overdue taxes totalling about 13 billion yen.</p>
<p>The shares stood at 66 yen at Tokyo midday on Tuesday, up one yen from the Monday close.</p>
<p>The Teikoku Databank report came during the stock market's midsession break.  </p>
<p>Teikoku Databank said in a report that Gajoen's transactions with banks had been suspended since January 6 after it failed to honour promissory notes for a second time.</p>
<p>The company, established in 1948, went public on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in 1950. Teikoku Databank said the company expanded its business to real estate transactions and posted annual revenues of 1.55 billion yen in the year to February 1990.</p>
<p>But its financial condition worsened in the early 1990s, when Japan's economic bubble burst, partly on its inability to collect some loans. In 1995/96, revenue slumped to a total of 1.3 billion yen, with uncovered losses soaring to more than five billion yen, Teikoku Databank said.</p>
<p>It said Gajoen, which operates hotels and wedding halls, would be the second company on the TSE's first section to fail this year after a chain of sushi restaurants, Kyotaru Co Ltd, made an insolvency filing in late January with debts of 101.3 billion yen.  </p>
<p>Last November, Gajoen said that it forecast a current loss of 300 million yen and a net loss of 5.3 billion yen for the year to February 28, 1997, compared with an actual current profit of 69 million yen and a net loss of 94 million yen the year before.</p>
