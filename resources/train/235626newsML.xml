<p>A court offficial in Vietnam's northern province of Lao Cai said on Wednesday that a local man had been executed for the rape and murder of his sister-in-law.</p>
<p>She said Ha Van Dan, 26, went before the firing squad on November 29 after his appeal against the death penalty was turned down by the president.</p>
<p>Dan was found guilty of dragging his brother's wife out of her house, raping her on a nearby hill and then, fearing she would denounce him, beating her to death with a flashlight.</p>
<p>Executions are not normally reported in Vietnam.</p>
<p>According to official media reports, 104 people were sentenced to death in 1995. But only 11 executions were officially reported during the course of that year.</p>
