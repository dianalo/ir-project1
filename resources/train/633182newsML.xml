<headline>Tradepoint slides, seeks long-term financing.</headline>

<p>Shares in the Tradepoint Investment Exchange, the main rival to the London Stock Exchange, fell sharply on Tuesday on concern over the company's financial position.</p>
<p>On Monday Tradepoint, which is traded on the Alternative Investment Market in London and the Vancouver Stock Exchange, announced an &quot;interim financing arrangement&quot; in a statement it made following &quot;market rumours&quot; about its financial position.</p>
<p>&quot;The company has, through its broker Williams de Brow, entered into an interim financing arrangement and is pursuing detailed negotiations to secure long-term financing,&quot; Tradepoint said in the statement on Monday.</p>
<p>At 1155 GMT its share price in London stood off 25 pence at 70 pence per share, but up from a low of 65 pence.</p>
<p>The concern was that Tradepoint, which is losing money each month, might be put into the hands of an administrator.</p>
<p>A statement about the company's long-term financing plans is expected later this week.</p>
<p>Tradepoint, which offers investors a facility to buy and sell shares electronically in more than 900 British companies, on Tuesday reported 334 trades in May -- the largest number of shares in any month over the past year -- valued at around 56 million stg.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the company said the May average represented 0.3 to 0.4 percent of the total London Stock Exchange turnover.</p>
<p>Tradepoint has said that it needs to hit around two percent to break even.</p>
