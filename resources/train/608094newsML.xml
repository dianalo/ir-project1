<p>Shares in ailing chicken producer Rainbow Chicken Ltd slumped to a fresh year low on Thursday as investors continued to bail out of the stock following heavy losses in the year to March.</p>
<p>Dealers on the Johannesburg bourse said after the disappointing results, which had been expected to show the start of a recovery at South Africa's biggest poultry firm, the share was seen even lower in the short term.</p>
<p>&quot;It's (down) on bad results, bad everything,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment is weak and people are saying there is no turnaround in that share due for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Rainbow shares fell eight percent or seven cents to a day low of 77 cents but by 1330 GMT had recovered slightly to 79 cents -- a loss of five cents.</p>
<p>Volume was pegged at 403,600 shares.</p>
<p>Rainbow earlier this month announced an attributable loss of 222.99 million rand from a 159.81 million loss the year before. </p>
<p>Analysts had been expecting losses to narrow slightly amid improved broiler prices in the second half of the group's financial year. </p>
<p>At the results announcement Rainbow said it expected to report a further loss in the six months to September 1997 although some benefits from an investment programme in facilities and people launched in 1996 should start becoming evident in the second half of the year.</p>
