<p>Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's three-month-old government will face a rocky ride in parliament this week over a recent decision to raise fuel prices, political leaders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest battle (with the government) over the oil price hike will be in the parliament,&quot; said Pradeep Nepal, a central committee member of the communist Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, which dominates the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>He told Reuters the UML was unhappy with the decision. &quot;The government will face more criticism from the ruling benches than from the opposition,&quot; Nepal said.</p>
<p>The parliament is set to convene on Thursday to debate the budget for the 1997/98 fiscal year, beginning on July 16.</p>
<p>The fractious alliance of communists and former royalists decided to increase fuel prices on June 13. The hike, which ranged from 14.7 percent for petrol to 60 percent for cooking gas, has been criticised by many coalition partners.</p>
<p>Officials said the price rises followed an increase in the prices of petroleum products in international markets.</p>
<p>The government says it raised the prices to aid the loss-making state-owned Nepal Oil Corp. The firm, which has a monopoly over the import and distribution of petroleum products in Nepal, had been losing about 30 million rupees ($525,400) a month since last October because of the subsidies.</p>
<p>But the communists fear the move, which came in the wake of their victory in local council elections, could jeopardise the party's political prospects.</p>
<p>The UML is the largest party in parliament, controlling 90 seats in the 205-member lower house. Chand's Rastriya Prajatantra Party has 20 deputies and the opposition Nepali Congress has 87 seats.</p>
<p>About 800 housewives protested against the price increase last week, demanding the government reconsider its decision.</p>
<p>Nepali truck and bus owners have threatened to raise fares by up to 35 percent unless the price hike is reversed. Officials have hinted that a slight cut in prices is possible.</p>
