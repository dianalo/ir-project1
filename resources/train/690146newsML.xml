<text>
<p>Foxmoor Industries Ltd said Wednesday it is mulling its options, including possible reorganization under bankruptcy law.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement that its results for the quarters ended December 31 and March 31 may have overstated earnings and inaccurately reported its cash position.</p>
<p>It said that its cash position, which had been reported to be $1,112,000 in March, is less than $20,000, and that the collection of a substantial portion of its accounts receivable, assignments receivable and advances to contractors -- totalling nearly $2 million -- &quot;appears to be doubtful.&quot;  </p>
<p>It said its liabilities are about $771,000.</p>
<p>It said to prevent further decline in its financial position, it is closing its warehouse in Denver and winding down other operations.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is considering all options for preservation of the company's assets, including the possibility of a reorganization under the bankruptcy laws,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company said Ross Corace had resigned as its president and that chairman and chief executive Paul Eagland had been named to the vacancy.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on its preliminary review, management believes that the former president of the company, Mr. Ross Corace, has financial obligations to the company in excess of $1,250,000,&quot; the statement said. It gave no further details and it was not immediately possible to reach the company for further comment.</p>
<p>The company said it would hire a new accounting firm to review its accounts and help determine the accuracy of its prior financial statements.</p>
