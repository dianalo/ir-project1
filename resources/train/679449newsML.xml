<headline>BASEBALL-ASTROS SIX-HIT CUBS, BAGWELL HOMERS AGAIN.</headline>
<dateline>HOUSTON 1997-06-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mike Hampton and Billy Wagner combined on a six-hitter to make Jeff Bagwell's two-run homer stand up and give the Houston Astros a 3-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs Sunday, completing a three-game sweep.</p>
<p>Hampton (3-6) gave up a run and five hits with three walks and four strikeouts in eight-plus innings. He allowed a leadoff double to Ryne Sandberg in the ninth before giving way to Wagner. Kevin Orie doubled to end the shutout, but was caught in a rundown on Mike Hubbard's bouncer back to the box.</p>
<p>&quot;Hampton was outstanding,&quot; Astros manager Larry Dierker said. &quot;He had good command of his fastball, his slider and his changeup. Those three pitches were so good, they kept them off balance.&quot;</p>
<p>Wagner struck out Rey Sanchez and got pinch-hitter Jose Hernandez to ground out, clinching his 13th save of the season and Hampton's first victory in eight starts since May 8.</p>
<p>Craig Biggio doubled to lead off the game and Pat Listach sacrificed him to third before Bagwell poked his National League-leading 22nd homer of the season barely over the wall in right field.</p>
<p>&quot;I've not done much of that this year,&quot; Bagwell said about homering to the opposite field. &quot;I've pretty much pulled everything this season. I didn't think it was going out of the ballpark and I was surprised when it went out.&quot;</p>
<p>Bagwell has 166 career homers, matching him with Glenn Davis for second place on Houston's all-time list. Jimmy Wynn is first with 223.</p>
<p>The Astros lead the National League Central Division by three games, ahead of the Cardinals.</p>
<p>The Cubs have lost five straight for the first time since May of last season. Kevin Foster (8-5) took the loss.</p>
<p>In New York, Carl Everett smashed a three-run homer in the bottom of the 10th as the Mets completed a four-game sweep with a 12-9 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>
<p>Mets reliever John Franco surrendered a two-out, two-run double to Joe Randa that tied the game in the top of the ninth but Chris Peters (2-1) issued one-out walks to Edgardo Alfonzo and John Olerud to set up Everett's drive over the left-field fence. It was Everett's first career four-hit game.</p>
<p>&quot;He hung a curveball, I hit the mess out of it,&quot; Everett said. &quot;It felt like a feather when it hit the bat.&quot;</p>
<p>Lance Johnson also had four hits, including his first homer of the season, for the Mets.</p>
<p>In St Louis, Alan Benes allowed one earned run and four hits over eight innings and Brian Jordan had two hits and two RBI, leading the Cardinals past the Cincinnati Reds, 5-2.</p>
<p>Benes (7-6) walked four and struck out seven before turning the ball over to Dennis Eckersley, who worked a perfect ninth and moved into a tie with Jeff Reardon for second on the all-time list with his 367th career save.</p>
<p>Reliever Scott Sullivan (1-2) took the loss.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Chipper Jones and Fred McGriff hit back-to-back homers as the Atlanta Braves smacked four home runs in a nine-run third inning en route to a 12-5 trouncing of the Phillies, who have lost eight straight games.</p>
<p>Jeff Blauser, Michael Tucker and Jones, the first three batters in the Atlanta lineup, went 9-for-14 with three homers, four doubles, eight RBI and seven runs scored.</p>
<p>Greg Maddux (9-3) got the win and Garrett Stephenson (2-3) took the loss.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Edgar Renteria's two-out single in the top of the ninth scored Todd Dunwoody with the go-ahead run and five pitchers combined on a six-hitter as the Florida Marlins defeated the Expos 2-0.</p>
<p>Florida has won eight of its last 11 games. The Marlins took two of three games from the Expos in a series that saw just 12 runs. The Expos lost for just the third time in their last 15 games.</p>
<p>In San Diego, Tony Gwynn's three-run double keyed a four-run eighth inning and rallied the Padres past the Colorado Rockies 4-2.</p>
<p>Gwynn went 2-for-4 to raise his batting average to .393.</p>
<p>Tim Worrell (3-6) pitched a perfect eighth to post the win. Reliever Bruce Ruffin (0-2) took the loss.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, first baseman Eric Karros's error on a slow bouncer by Mark Lewis in the seventh allowed J.T. Snow to race home with the go-ahead run as the Giants stopped the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2.</p>
<p>Kirk Rueter (4-2) allowed two runs and five hits over seven innings to improve to 3-0 lifetime against the Dodgers. Rod Beck worked the ninth for his league-leading 24th save.</p>
<p>Chan Ho Park (5-4) took the loss.</p>
<p>Greg Gagne homered for the Dodgers and Barry Bonds hit his 16th for the Giants.</p>
