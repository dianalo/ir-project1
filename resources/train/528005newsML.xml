<title>INDONESIA: Jakarta stocks end up on bargain-hunting, rumours.</title>
<headline>Jakarta stocks end up on bargain-hunting, rumours.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bargain-hunting in selected financial counters and active speculative buying of small property stocks pushed the Jakarta stock index higher on Tuesday, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>The composite index rose 3.98 points, or 0.62 percent, to close at 646.24 points. Advancers led decliners by 77 to 51 with 68 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>Total turn-over was estimated at 378 billion rupiah compared with 296 billion rupiah on Monday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Local speculators dominated the market. They bought small firm Elang Realty at spectacular trading volumes with no clear picture of how the possible rights issue could impact on the firm's performance,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Elang rose 100 rupiah to close at 1,025 rupiah, with some 38 million shares traded on the strength of the rights issue talk.</p>
<p>One property analyst said the extent of the trading volume could be gauged by the fact that the firm offered only 110 million shares at its initial public offering in October 1995.</p>
<p>Analysts said they did not cover Elang due to its small capitalisation and illiquidity and so declined to comment on the firm's expected performance this year.  </p>
<p>&quot;BII would very likely be able to mitigate the impact of lower loan growth on net interest income this year with better asset-liability management and with the help of a one trillion rupiah rights issue,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
