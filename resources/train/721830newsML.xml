<p>A White House report today that praised the North American Free Trade Agreement's effect on the U.S. economy should help bridge the gap between the agreement's opponents and supporters, Canada's trade minister said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope what the report does is bridge the gap between the two solitudes,&quot; Trade Minister Sergio Marchi said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>White House officials said on Friday that the first three years of NAFTA had a &quot;modest positive&quot; impact on the U.S. eoconomy. A new report on NAFTA said the pact created jobs in the United States and boosted business in many U.S. industries.</p>
<p>Critics have said that NAFTA had harmful effects on workers and had not lived up to expectations of better trade balances with Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>But Marchi's assessment of the first three years of the agreement was enthusiastic, despite his own campaigning against the deal before it was passed.</p>
<p>&quot;For us, it's a real coming of age,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Canada's trade surplus with the United States has flourished since NAFTA was passed, but its trade deficit with Mexico has soared to C$4.8 billion in 1996 from C$2.9 billion in 1993.</p>
<p>But Marchi said Canadian exports to Mexico were climbing gradually and that &quot;the trend lines are positive.&quot;</p>
<p>The NAFTA report was expected to lay the ground work for a push later this year by U.S. President Bill Clinton for new trade negotiation authority to allow him to negotiate an expansion of NAFTA to include Chile without fear the agreement would be changed by Congress.</p>
<p>Marchi, who visited trade officials in Washington earlier this week, said the report would likely help Clinton's case for so-called fast-track authority, but would not be sufficient by itself.</p>
<p>&quot;He will have to gain fast-track authority by appealing to the moderate (factions) in both parties,&quot; Marchi said.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt that the administration is feeling quite bullish and aggressive about going after fast-track,&quot; Marchi said of his talks in Washington.</p>
