<p>Martine Aubry, France's new superminister for employment and social solidarity, is a key strategist for Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and one of his Socialist party's most popular rising stars.</p>
<p>At 46, Aubry, a courteous but earnest technocrat in the mould of her father, former European Commission president Jacques Delors, becomes number two in the Jospin government.</p>
<p>Her sharp mind and dynamic, hands-on style won her a leading role among the &quot;quadras&quot;, or fortysomethings, who have revived the battered, sleaze-tainted party since it was ousted from power in a 1993 conservative landslide.</p>
<p>During the campaign for last Sunday's parliamentary election, she was a fixture on television, debating rival political heavyweights in a dry but forceful manner.</p>
<p>Like her father, she consistently ranks among the nation's five most popular politicians and is often mentioned as a possible future Socialist prime minister or even as the nation's first woman president.</p>
<p>A former labour minister in two cabinets in 1991-93, she has cast herself as a champion of the millions left unemployed and without hope by the last decade's economic upheavals.</p>
<p>After the Socialists lost power, Aubry kept herself in the public eye with her own anti-unemployment foundation, Agir contre l'Exclusion (Action against Poverty), funded by leading industrialists with whom she is on excellent terms.</p>
<p>&quot;We must give hope to those young people who are suffering and have lost their faith,&quot; she said in a recent interview. &quot;In any case, what we have been able to accomplish is only a few drops of water in an ocean of exclusion.&quot;</p>
<p>She has also methodically built a power base in the northern city of Lille, serving as deputy to mayor Pierre Mauroy, a former prime minister, and winning a parliamentary seat for a Lille constituency in the general election.</p>
<p>When her father decided against running for the presidency in 1995, Aubry was even cited, at the relatively young age of 44, as a potential candidate.</p>
<p>She argued that the centre-right government's austerity programme, put in place to help France qualify for a single European currency, should not be used as an excuse to ignore record 12.8 percent unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;The short-term problem in France is to boost consumer demand, and thus encourage our businesses to invest,&quot; she said in a recent television appearance.</p>
<p>While her father is a symbol of European integration, Aubry toes the Socialist Party's current line favouring a more cautious and conditional approach to European monetary union.</p>
<p>Aubry first stepped into the spotlight when Edith Cresson, France's first woman prime minister, plucked her from the obscurity of state-owned aluminium firm Pechiney to make her labour minister in 1991.</p>
<p>Her tenure was characterised by a gritty commitment to her work and a refusal to be discouraged by mounting job losses which took unemployment over three million. Her schemes were marked by a common element -- they were inexpensive.</p>
<p>Her grass roots approach was typified by surprise visits to neighbourhood job centres to chat to staff and the unemployed.</p>
<p>Born Martine Delors on August 8, 1950, in Paris, she married accountant Xavier Aubry in October 1973. They have a daughter. Her hobbies are tennis and skiing.</p>
