<p>The Bank of France shaved interest rates on Tuesday because of evidence on the economy and market confidence, but it remains as committed as ever to defending the franc, governor Jean-Claude Trichet said.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought the elements we had in front of us on inflation, on external accounts and on the confidence of market were advising us to give that sign of confidence,&quot; he said in an interview on Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Following a meeting of its monetary policy council earlier, the Bank cut its intervention rate by five basis points to 3.15 percent. It lowered its five-to-10 day lending rate by 15 basis points to 4.60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are as you know inflexibly attached to the stability of the franc among the group of the most credible countries in Europe and this is an integral part of our monetary policy,&quot; Trichet told RFTV.</p>
<p>Earlier, in an annual press conference, Trichet reaffirmed the central bank's policy of defending the franc against the most credible currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>Trichet said French monetary policy was paying off with the lowest rates in Europe and the third lowest in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Our monetary policy of responsibility, credibility and stability is paying off and we are quite satisfied with our present course,&quot; he said on RFTV.</p>
