<p>One person died and 28 were injured, eight of them seriously, when a blast rocked a station of the regional express underground railway in central Paris on Tuesday, the fire brigade said.</p>
<p>The explosion occurred just before 6.30 p.m. (1730 GMT) at the Port Royal RER station on the Left Bank.  </p>
<p>The blast took place in a carriage of the RER train.</p>
<p>&quot;We heard a strong blast,&quot; one witness who was in a bus above the station told France-Info radio. &quot;There was a column of black smoke which enveloped the bus. There was a strong smell of powder, like at a shooting range,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Justice sources said anti-terrorism investigators had been called to the scene.</p>
<p>The explosion occurred on the same line, and two stations away from Saint-Michel station where a blast in July last year killed eight people and injured nearly 100, launching a wave of attacks across France by Algerian Moslem fundamentalists.</p>
