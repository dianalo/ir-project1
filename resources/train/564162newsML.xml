<headline>German shares seek refuge after stormy day.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>German shares settled into calmer territory late on Tuesday after being buffeted by a see-sawing dollar and uncertain Wall Street on a day which saw prices reach, then lose new record highs.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index was down 12.97 points at 3,552.72 points at 1409 GMT, recovering from a session low of 3,337.98 but far from its early high of 3,612.46 points.</p>
<p>Prices had held steady or higher through the day until an initial weak opening on Wall Street and plunge by the dollar sent prices tumbling in a low-volume afternoon session.</p>
<p>Dealers said it was time to sit back and wait.  </p>
<p>&quot;It might be time to consolidate. There are a few nerves about on possible interventions in the currency market,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;It was alarming to see the market take such a beating today of all days,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>German shares hit several highs earlier in the session, passing the 3,600 IBIS DAX point level for the first time ever and reaching a record DAX close of 3,568.28 points.</p>
<p>But nerves had set in close to Wall Street's opening as dealers expected profits to be taken in the U.S. in the wake of Monday's strong gains.  </p>
<p>But dealers said most of the losses in late trade were technically driven and could be quickly reversed.</p>
<p>Losses on index heavyweights like  Siemens AG, down 1.27 marks at 97.41 marks, were due to profit-taking, dealers said.</p>
<p>Software group SAP AG was also weak, resuming a decline on Monday after news of a probe into alleged insider dealing in its shares. However dealers also downplayed this development as likely to be short-lived.</p>
<p>Utility Veba AG continued to outperform, up 2.90 marks at 93.10 marks, on well-received first quarter earnings.</p>
