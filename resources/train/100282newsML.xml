<p>Afghanistan's new hardline Islamic rulers urged a powerful northern Uzbek chief on Monday to stay out of their fight with the ousted government military chief and help bring peace to a country ravaged by 17 years of war.</p>
<p>Acting Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Ghous said it appeared Uzbek General Abdul Rashid Dostum was prepared to back Ahmad Shah Masood, now battling to keep Taleban fighters out of his Panjsher Valley base north of Kabul.</p>
<p>The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) quoted Dostum, who runs six northern provinces from the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, as saying he would come to the help of any compatriot under attack unless the Taleban stopped fighting, an apparent reference to Masood.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it seems that they are interested in joining together to take action against the Taleban. If General Dostum realises this aim, it will be a great mistake,&quot; said Ghous, whose government has said it has no quarrel with Dostum.</p>
<p>He called on both Dostum and Masood to accept a general amnesty offer and assured Masood, widely regarded as one of the best guerrilla commanders in a war against a Soviet-backed government in the 1980s, that he would not be harmed if he surrendered.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing would put his life in jeopardy and he can take part in the future government,&quot; Ghous told reporters.</p>
<p>But the terms he offered to the two military leaders still holding out against the Taleban, who have swept to control of three-quarters of Afghanistan, appeared very different.</p>
<p>Masood, an ethnic Tajik fighting Taleban warriors trying to force their way through the narrow gorge leading into the Panjsher, would have to yield his heavy weapons.</p>
<p>But Ghous seemed to suggest Dostum could keep his heavy weapons as long as he posed no danger to the government.</p>
<p>Dostum shifted armour and Uzbek soldiers, who are descended from the Mongols of Genghis Khan, south to block the main pass through the Hindu Kush that leads into his territory from Kabul.</p>
<p>&quot;If such heavy weapons at the disposal of a certain force do not pose a threat to the central government and are not being used by a self-willed person, then...we are not opposed to that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Negotiations should be conducted with the central government on not allowing the misuse of such weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>Western sources who have had extensive dealings with the Taleban say they discern a split between purists and pragmatists on how to deal with Dostum, who has a strong army and a small air force.</p>
<p>&quot;The purists see Dostum as a bad Moslem, an ex-communist, and that the Sharia (Islamic law) should be imposed on his territory as it has been elsewhere to complete the Jihad (holy war) begun against the communists,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>&quot;The pragmatists say Dostum provides a useful buffer against the Central Asian states and Russia, who would be alarmed at any move against him and would probably come to his aid,&quot; he said. &quot;They say the Taleban are not ready to take him on and it would be better to negotiate.&quot;</p>
<p>Few Afghan watchers believe the Taleban could co-exist for long with Dostum, who abandoned the communist government just before it fell in 1992 because it posted an ethnic Pashtun to Mazar-i-Sharif.</p>
<p>He joined Masood and they took control of Kabul, but fell out with the Tajik chief in 1994, staged an abortive coup and withdrew to the north.</p>
<p>If he and Masood did rejoin forces, they would form a strong alliance against the Taleban which would effectivly divide Afghanistan and could be supported by the largely Moslem states of Central Asia, especially Uzbekistan, the western sources said.</p>
<p>Many of those states, along with Russia, have expressed alarm at the Taleban advance north of Kabul and vowed to defend themselves against any expansionism.</p>
