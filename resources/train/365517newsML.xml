<p>Jay Don Blake shot a third-round, six-under par 66 at the Buick Invitational on Saturday to put himself into solid position to claim his long-awaited second PGA Tour victory.</p>
<p>Blake stood at 14-under-par 202 through 54 holes for a two-stroke lead over Mike Hulbert and Mark O'Meara.</p>
<p>In more than 10 years on the PGA Tour, Blake has won only once -- in this tournament in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to coming here because I've won here,&quot; he said. &quot;It motivates you more to get to playing well.&quot;</p>
<p>Blake, who carded six birdies and no bogeys, had the low round of the day on the South Course at Torrey Pines, which was playing more difficult than it had in previous days.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to play rounds of golf when you don't make any bogeys, especially on a course with the rough being the way it is,&quot; Blake said. &quot;I didn't drive it really well, but I kept it in play.&quot;</p>
<p>O'Meara, seeking his second consecutive victory, held the lead for a time Saturday. But bogeys at the 11th, 12th and 17th holes, dropped him back to 71 and a share of second place.</p>
<p>The one-under 71 snapped a string of 12 successive rounds in the 60s for O'Meara.</p>
<p>&quot;I was worried about trying to find my golf ball and to keep it in play,&quot; O'Meara said. &quot;Today was one of those days when I had to grind it out.</p>
<p>&quot;But when I'm missing, I'm pretty much missing the same way,&quot; O'Meara said. &quot;It shouldn't be that impossible to fix. If I drive the ball well (Sunday) I should be able to contend.&quot;</p>
<p>Jesper Parnevik of Sweden, who has finished third, second and tied for fifth in three PGA Tour starts this year, shot a 69 and was tied for fourth, three strokes behind Blake, along with Craig Stadler.</p>
<p>Stadler, who won here in 1994, could have been tied for second, but missed a four-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole.</p>
