<p>Belgium's biggest bank Generale Bank together with its French Fimagest unit is taking control of Boston-based U.S. fund manager Harbor Capital Management Company Inc.</p>
<p>HCM manages $5 billion (175 billion Belgian francs) in assets for 200 clients including pension funds and individuals.</p>
<p>Generale Bank Managing Director Andre Bergen told a news conference on Wednesday the two would, subject to regulatory and minority shareholder approval, buy at least a 51 percent stake in HCM with a seven-year option to raise that to 75 percent.</p>
<p>The price paid would be based on an estimate of 100 percent of HCM's value of around one percent of funds under management. The cost would be split 66/33 between Generale and Fimagest.</p>
<p>&quot;This is below the average market price but...HCM personnel will remain shareholders and will be closely interested in the evolution of the company,&quot; Bergen said.</p>
<p>HCM staff at present own 85 percent of the company. The rest is held by Switzerland's Julius Baer Holding.</p>
<p>Bergen said Generale would, as part of the deal, acquire about two thirds of the Swiss holding's stake.</p>
<p>He said the deal would lift Generale Bank's total funds under management to 2,000 billion Belgian francs, of which 1,200 billion is in mutual funds and 800 million in private asset management.</p>
<p>&quot;The partnership (with HCM) basically completes the international presence we wanted to have in fund management based on a strategic decision taken in 1994,&quot; Bergen said.</p>
<p>Generale Bank was now present in Europe, Asia and the U.S. It is present in Asia via units in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;With this acquisition we are the first Belgian bank to put its asset management on a global basis,&quot; Bergen said. &quot;Today in asset management we have no other acquisition projects.&quot;</p>
<p>The purchase is accompanied by a reorganisation of European fund management activities. Equity and French franc activities are to be based in Paris. Tactical asset allocation and fixed income investments will be handled from Brussels.</p>
<p>Michel Charlier, head of the asset management division, said recent purchases had led to some overlap in its fund businesses. With the arrival of Europe's single currency this would grow as the lines between funds in different currencies blurred.</p>
<p>&quot;It's now the right time to put it all together and think ahead,&quot; he said.</p>
