<p>French President Jacques Chirac, after forcing Prime Minister Alain Juppe to quit, has stepped into the premier's shoes to try and salvage his political majority before Sunday's runoff parliamentary vote.</p>
<p>But the head of state's televised address on Tuesday failed to set a precise manifesto for change, partly because his hands are tied by the possibility of having to share power with a Socialist-Communist government if the left wins.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us take care not to compromise everything at the moment when we are reaping the first fruits of our efforts,&quot; the Gaullist president said after the left outpolled the centre-right government in last Sunday's first round.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you really want to put the socialist ideas of yesteryear back in the saddle?,&quot; he asked. &quot;Given what is at risk, my dear compatriots, can you take the risk of abstaining?&quot;</p>
<p>But Chirac did not say who he would choose to succeed fellow Gaullist Prime Minister Alain Juppe if the ruling centre-right coalition managed to overtake the left-wing opposition.</p>
<p>Chirac left voters no wiser as to whether he favoured socially-minded Gaullist Philippe Seguin or free-marketeering ex-prime minister Edouard Balladur to succeed Juppe.</p>
<p>The President's statement had little effect on French financial markets and analysts said it was not likely to boost the centre-right coalition's chances.</p>
<p>&quot;All of it is pretty much going over the same ground,&quot; said Iain Lindsay, senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. &quot;He seemed to be preparing the way for a cohabitation,&quot; said Paul Horne, senior economist with Smith Barney in Paris.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Lionel Jospin, tipped to succeed Juppe if the left wins the runoff ballot, called the speech &quot;a formidable admission of failure&quot; but dealt carefully with the man with whom he may taste &quot;cohabitation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;One can understand Chirac wanting to step onto the pitch to give a team a boost, but he cannot replace it. The constitution does not allow him to do so,&quot; Jospin said, adding that the President would not be &quot;at issue&quot; after the runoff ballot.</p>
<p>Jospin's Communist ally Robert Hue said Chirac had failed to understand the voters' message and was simply repeating his pre-election refrain.</p>
<p>Extreme-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, whose supporters may hold the key to the outcome of the runoff, said Chirac appeared to be already resigned to sharing power with a left-wing government from next Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The president wanted to be as neutral and as flat as possible, and he succeeded. He wanted to sit on the fence. In his mind he is already in the cohabitation which he sees as inevitable,&quot; Le Pen said.</p>
<p>Greens party leader Dominique Voynet called Chirac's intervention &quot;a non-event&quot; and accused him of treating voters as simpletons. &quot;He wanted to whip up the French people, but we will whip him by showing we want to change majority,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>French investors recovered their nerve on Tuesday after Monday's 3.9 percent plunge in share prices -- the biggest one-day dive in four years. Traders said even a left-wing win would bring no radical change in economic policy.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC 40 index closed up nearly one percent.</p>
