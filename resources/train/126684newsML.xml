<p>The Casablanca bourse ended its weekly trading on Friday slightly higher, pushed mainly by the market's largest capitalisation companies, stockbrokers said.</p>
<p>The all-share index closed at 434.47 points, up from 432.95 points over the past week.</p>
<p>ONA group, Morocco's largest private conglomerate, was traded at 472, up seven dirhams compared with the previous week.</p>

<p>Sonasid steel mill gained one dirham over the week to close at 333 dirhams.</p>
<p>Casablanca Finance Group (CFG), one of the Moroccan stock market's three indices, on Friday modified the composition of its index by the introduction of Sonasid to replace Cadem cement firm, said Ismail Douiri, analyst at Casablanca.</p>
<p>The change was based on market capitalisation, liquidity and sector representation, he said.</p>
<p>CFG 25 index represents 85.6 percent of the global market capitalisation, Douiri added.</p>
<p>The index tracks the 25 most liquid stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;The market pursued its upward trend as traders were investing in the privatised Fertima fertlisers company...The bourse index was also pulled up by active trading in the market capitalisation companies,&quot; said a stockbroker with Upline Securities.</p>
