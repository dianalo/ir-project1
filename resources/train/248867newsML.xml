<p>International police in Bosnia said on Wednesday they spotted indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic under armed escort but the NATO-led force took no action to arrest him.</p>
<p>International police monitors saw Karadzic in a Jeep on Monday, escorted by heavily armed special police in the Serb government seat of Pale, outside Sarajevo, a spokesman for the United Nations police told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;In the back seat with the window open the monitors saw one of the most wanted men on the planet, Radovan Karadzic, enjoying the view,&quot; Alexander Ivanko said.</p>
<p>Local police stopped traffic at a junction shortly before Karadzic's convoy of four vehicles arrived and the convoy headed in the direction of his headquarters at a diesel engine factory in Pale, Ivanko said.</p>
<p>The international monitors immediately informed the NATO-led peace force of the sighting, he said.</p>
<p>NATO chose not to launch an operation to arrest Karadzic at the Famos factory and never seriously considered it, NATO spokesman Major Brett Boudreau told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We received the report. I'm not aware of us doing anything in particular in the sense that we didn't put a guard around the Famos factory,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>NATO commanders say peacekeeping troops will arrest any war crimes suspects they encounter during their normal duties but have ruled out &quot;manhunts&quot;, fearing possible casualties and a backlash against the mission.</p>
<p>Boudreau said the peacekeeping force took its orders from its political masters in the North Atlantic Council and so far NATO opposed any plans to launch &quot;manhunts&quot;.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;There is obviously some building pressure on the international scene for something to be done...That pressure continues to mount and incidents like this will further that process along.&quot;</p>
<p>The commissioner of the International Police Task Force (IPTF) had delivered a strong protest to the Bosnian Serb interior minister &quot;expressing the U.N.'s dismay at the use of police to escort and provide traffic control for an indicted war criminal&quot;, Ivanko said.</p>
<p>Dragan Kijac, Serb interior minister, has refused to halt special police escorts for Karadzic and rejected demands from the IPTF to attach the special police to a specific precinct, he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the international High Representative to Bosnia, Carl Bildt, said it was &quot;outrageous&quot; that Karadzic was roaming freely through Bosnia.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Bildt has said frequently and loudly that the international community should consider the formation of specially trained units that should do this (arrest war crimes suspects) and do it without further delay,&quot; spokesman Colum Murphy said.</p>
<p>Karadzic stepped down as president in July under international pressure but continues to wield influence behind the scenes, political sources say.</p>
<p>The U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague has charged Karadzic with crimes against humanity and genocide linked to the siege of Sarajevo, the capture of U.N. peacekeepers and the slaughter of up to 8,000 Moslem men from the Srebrenica enclave.</p>
