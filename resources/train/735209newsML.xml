<p>North Sea crudes strengthened with outright prices on Thursday as both physical and paper values posted gains on a slew of bullish factors, traders said.</p>
<p>September Brent crude futures were trading 40 cents firmer at $18.70 a barrel, buoyed by the threat of storm disruption to oil output in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Crude supplies to Gulf Coast refiners are expected to be curtailed after crews were evacuated from several offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday due to the approach of the tropical storm.</p>
<p>In addition, production was shut-in at Colombia's Cano Limon field due to bomb damage to a pipeline.</p>
<p>Dealers also cited the continued absence of Iraqi crude and possible sales opportunities into the U.S. Gulf amid talk that a U.S. refiner had chartered a ULCC to take Brent transatlantic in August.</p>
<p>&quot;There's just a whole lot of bullish stories helping the market up today,&quot; one trader commented.</p>
<p>A cargo of Brent blend loading July 27-29 changed hands eight cents firmer at a five cent premium to August Brent. A cargo loading the same dates moved at August -3 cents on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Differentials for some other grades showed gains of 10 to 15 cents. An Oseberg loading August 10-12 moved six cents firmer at Dated Brent +26. An Ekofisk loading August 13-15 was sold over 10 cents firmer at Dated Brent +28 cents.</p>
<p>The first Brent cargo from the August loading programme due to turn wet on Thursday was kept by Suko.</p>
<p>The paper market recorded strong gains. The August/September spread was firmly in backwardation, trading once at +13 cents. five times at +12 cents, and also at +10, +8 and +5 cents.</p>
<p>CFDs for next week (July 21-25) gained around 15 cents to talk at September Brent +2/+5 cents. Later weeks also gained 10 cents.</p>
<p>Further bullishness came from news that the North Sea Nelson field, which feeds into the Forties system, was having problems with the quality of the gas that is injected into its secondary recovery system.</p>
<p>The problems have already shaved 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) of the output and could lower output further over the coming week.</p>
<p>Forties was already looking healthier, having moved five cents firmer at Dated +35 cents late on Wednesday. There was unconfirmed talk that a Forties also moved.</p>
<p>But some sceptics struggled to make sense of the rising market, saying fundamentals alone weren't sufficient to push values higher.</p>
<p>They suggested that one or two traders may be trying to push up quotes to support a swaps position.</p>
