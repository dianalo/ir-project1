<p>This is how major world bond markets were trading in late European business on Friday.</p>
<p>GERMANY - Bunds pared gains in late-session trading amid position-squaring after higher U.S. Treasuries could not pull the market out of established range. The March Bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) was trading at 100.40, up 0.08 from Thursday's settlement price.</p>
<p>BRITAIN - UK gilts settled modestly higher on the day in thin pre-holiday trade with sentiment much improved. Traders said gilts' quick recovery after big losses earlier in the week bodes well for stable end to year. The March long gilt future on LIFFE was trading at 109-04/32, up  02/32 from Thursday's settlement price.</p>
<p>FRANCE - March bond futures settled slightly higher after a quiet session, stuck in a 10-tick range, with volume low. March PIBOR got an early boost from call money cut but the weaker franc weighed. The March notional bond future on the MATIF in Paris settled at 128.78 was up 0.26 from Thursday's settlement price.</p>
<p>ITALY - Italian bond futures slipped lower in late afternoon trade on scattered profit-taking ahead of a further six Italian cities reporting Dec CPI. Most analysts expect a Dec CPI rate steady at Nov's 2.6 percent which could prompt an interest rate cut from the Bank of Italy. The March bond future on LIFFE was trading at 128.55 down 0.17 from Thursday's settlement price.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - U.S. Treasuries were little changed in technical morning trade. Prices were locked in a range, with activity scant and volume thin. Money managers were mostly sidelined ahead of year-end holidays. Some spec trading was noted earlier. Nov import/export prices data, Q3 GDP revision were shrugged off.The March Treasury bond future on the Chicago Board of Trade was trading at 113-09/32 up 4/32 from Thursday's settlement price. The long bond was quoted to yield 6.59 percent.</p>
<p>JAPAN - Japanese government bond futures ended up but off earlier highs. Key March contract was capped by position-adjustment sales ahead of the long weekend. The Tokyo market will be closed for holiday on next Monday.In after hours trading the March future on LIFFE was trading at 126.19, down 0.11 from Thursday's settlement price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>EUROBONDS - The primary market, quiet for the past couple of weeks, saw another uneventful day in the run-up to the Christmas week but syndicate managers said there were a lot of issues in store for the New Year. True to form as regular borrowers in the Euromarket, two supranationals hit the screen on Friday -- the EIB with an11.5 billion peseta 20-year offering and earlier in the session the World Bank with a NZ$200 million five-year deal.</p>
