<headline>FOCUS - MFI disappoints on profits, sales.</headline>

<p>MFI Furniture Group Plc, Britain's market leader in fitted kitchens and bedrooms, on Tuesday reported a 21 percent rise in annual profits but said sales had only just started to pick up after deteriorating sharply in the second half.</p>
<p>Disappointment that MFI had not felt the benefits yet from Britain's spending boom hit the retailer's shares, which stood 7.5 pence lower at 127.5 pence by midmorning.</p>
<p>Retail analysts said the results were below expectations. &quot;Given the state of the economy, profitability is very disappointing,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Sales in the first two months of its current financial year were five percent ahead of the same period last year, when sales had grown as much as 15 percent.</p>
<p>The retailer's sales in the year to April 26 rose over 10 percent to 845.6 million pounds ($1.4 billion) ($1.4 billion), with sales per square foot in the UK up nine percent.</p>
<p>Pretax profits rose to 70.3 million pounds from 58.1 million.</p>
<p>MFI said business had picked up since the general election in May and was hopeful the benefit of windfall spending from building society flotations was still to come.</p>
<p>&quot;From about November through to the end of April business was deteriorating, but since the election's out of the way it's improved,&quot; chief executive John Randall said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Randall said the biggest factor driving the recovery in sales growth, which had dropped to two to three percent in March and April, was increased consumer confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the biggest single factor is confidence,&quot; Randall said, &quot;I think that's what's been lacking until relatively recently -- the last couple of months.&quot;</p>
<p>He was sceptical about the view that the consumer economy was already overheating, prompting calls for measures to curb consumer spending in the new Labour government's first budget on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I find this talk about overheating a little bizarre...we've had a couple of good months but I wouldn't suggest that the months prior to that were particularly good.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it was a little early for MFI's customers to be spending the cash received via the demutualisation of home loan groups such as Halifax. The current sales upturn was likely to be the result of business that had been in the pipeline for the past six months.</p>
<p>&quot;My hope is that the windfalls are still to come,&quot; Randall said.</p>
<p>The housing market, which inevitably affects MFI's business, had seen a gradual improvement, but this was confined to the south east of England and the top end of the market, he said.</p>
<p>MFI's new Homeworks format was continuing to perform well, achieving a 10 percent additional growth in sales. The company has converted half of its 186 stores and hopes to complete the process over the next two years.</p>
<p>Randall said the conversion programme, plus a large warehouse pilot scheme, had meant additional costs in terms of payroll and overheads during the year. But he predicted costs would fall over the next 18 months as a result of the new warehouse system and other efficiencies.</p>
<p>The strong pound helped MFI to lower manufacturing costs, but hit earnings from France, where it has 99 stores trading under the Hygena name.</p>
<p>France broke even after making a small profit in the previous year. Randall said more stringent planning restrictions had forced the group to switch to smaller stores unaffected by the new planning regulations.</p>
<p>This will allow the group to speed up expansion, with the aim of having 200 stores in the next two to three years.</p>
<p>The group also has five trial stores in Spain, and has other European countries in its sites, but Randall would not say which ones.</p>
