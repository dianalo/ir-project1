<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan vice-president may visit Vatican, Poland.</title>
<headline>Taiwan vice-president may visit Vatican, Poland.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-01-08</dateline>

<p>Taiwan Vice-President Lien Chan plans to extend his Central American damage-control mission to Europe, with possible stops at the Vatican or Poland, local media reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lien made a brief stopover in Los Angeles on Tuesday en route to Nicaragua for Friday's inauguration of President Arnoldo Aleman in Managua. His journey includes an overnight stop in New York on January 11 on his return to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The mass circulation United Daily News, quoting unnamed high-level sources in the United States and the Vatican, said Lien would leave New York for the Vatican on January 12.</p>
<p>Another leading Taipei newspaper, the China Times, said Lien would go to Poland, which recognises Beijing but maintains close unofficial economic ties with the island. It gave no details.</p>
<p>Taiwan officials were tight-lipped on Lien's possible detour to Europe, declining to confirm or deny the reports.</p>
<p>The Vatican, like Nicaragua, is one of only 30 states that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government instead of the rival communist Chinese government in Beijing.</p>
<p>Aside from the Vatican, most of Taiwan's diplomatic partners are underdeveloped countries in Africa and Central America.</p>
<p>Beijing has expressed a desire to improve ties with the Vatican, but says the Holy See first would have to sever links with Taiwan -- which Beijing regards as a renegade province ineligible for sovereign recognition.</p>
<p>China's officially atheist government refuses to allow the country's state-sanctioned Catholic church to swear allegiance to the Pope, insisting that it remain independent.</p>
<p>Taiwan media have said Lien set the Nicaragua visit for fear that Managua may be tempted to ditch Taipei after South Africa announced in November it would switch allegiance in 1997.</p>
<p>Pretoria has been Taiwan's biggest ally.</p>
<p>Communist China and Taiwan have been arch rivals since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Beijing has tightened a diplomatic squeeze on Taipei in its quest to bring Taiwan under mainland rule.</p>
<p>Senior officials have embarked on a series of damage-control visits overseas in the aftermath of Pretoria's surprise move.</p>
<p>Between them, Lien and Foreign Minister John Chang have visited Ukraine, Singapore, Malaysia, Belgium, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in the past year, seeking to firm up unofficial ties.</p>
