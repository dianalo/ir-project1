<p>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would defeat any of his potential challengers in next year's election, according to a poll released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Former Police Commissioner William Bratton fared best among the proposed contenders, according to the survey of registered city voters conducted by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute of Hamden, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Bratton, who resigned under pressure from Giuliani, would lose 36 percent to Giuliani's 45 percent in a theoretical matchup, the poll said. The former police chief, who now works for a private security firm, has brushed aside suggestions in the media that he run for mayor.</p>
<p>Giuliani, a Republican, also would defeat black activist Rev. Al Sharpton, City Council member Sal Albanese, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger or City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, the poll said.</p>
<p>Giuliani has not officially declared his plans to seek re-election and only Albanese and Sharpton have said they intend to challenge him.</p>
<p>Survey respondents gave Giuliani a whopping 74 percent approval rating for his handling of crime, a key issue in the mayor's rocky relations with the former police commissioner. The two clashed over who deserved credit for a dramatic drop in the city's crime rate.</p>
<p>Quinnipiac polled 789 New York City residents who said they were registered voters from Nov 11 to 17. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percent.</p>
