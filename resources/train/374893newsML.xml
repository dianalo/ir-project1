<p>IPE gas oil futures closed $4.50 weaker on Thursday after finding comfortable support and trading in a well-defined range around $180 a tonne, traders said.</p>
<p>Front-month March last traded at $180.25 a tonne after weaker early NYMEX futures and erratic IPE Brent helped move it down from the $181 to $182 range.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas oil just consolidated at a lower level in reasonable volume, nothing special. Brent saw the real action today,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The contract found solid support at $178.50 and traders saw resistance at around $185.25.</p>
<p>Prompt March Brent, which expires at the close, was narrowly firmer in choppy afternoon trade as supportive technical factors held ground against bearish fundamentals, dealers said.</p>
<p>Brent was trading at $20.55 a barrel at 1805 GMT, up three cents, after see-sawing throughout the afternoon and plunging to a new session low of $20.30. The more actively traded April Brent was two cents lower at $20.22.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty nervous today. People aren't sure about which way it's going to go next,&quot; said a broker.</p>
