<p>Thai stocks extended gains on Thursday but late profit taking trimmed a sharp rally on hectic morning buying by foreign and local investors, traders said.</p>
<p>The SET Index rose 2.18 percent, or 15.96 points, to 747.70 on heavy 9.35 billion baht turnover. The SET 50 rose 2.77 percent, or 1.50 points, to 55.57.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say there was healthy consolidation on yesterday's rally though foreigners took profits during the afternoon especially in the finance sector, retailers continued to buy the market,&quot; said a trader at Phatra Thanakit.  </p>
<p>Turnover reached its high since mid-November as the baht's continued stability buoyed investors to follow through on Wednesday's 4.5 percent rally.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very, very busy. The volumes were high so I think we might see more gains next week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though foreigners were mostly taking profits in the afternoon, I think there will still be buying interest next week in selective stocks,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Most active stocks saw gains trimmed by profit taking in the afternoon as the market came off its intraday high of 759.51.</p>
<p>Large commercial banks led the active list. Bangkok Bank rose four baht to 175, and Siam Commercial Bank gained six to 142.</p>
<p>Siam Cement put on 56 to 724, National Petrochemical extended its recent strong run, rising 2.25 to 26.50, and Phatra Thanakit (PHAT.BK added 4.5 baht to 55.50.</p>
