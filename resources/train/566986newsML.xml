<p>Canadian T-bills opened weaker on Wednesday, after making sharp gains on Tuesday, amid weakness in the currency and renewed concern about a possible U.S. rate hike, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the focus has shifted to concerns over what the (U.S.) Beige Book might show us. I think there's a little bit of a renewed focus on the possibility that in fact the Fed might go again in May,&quot; said Walter Posiewko, a money market trader with Royal Bank Investment Management Inc.</p>
<p>Canada's three-month when-issued T-bill softened to yield 3.07 percent from 3.04 percent at Tuesday's close.  </p>
<p>This morning's weakness in T-bills followed gains on Tuesday which saw the yield on the three-month bill drop below 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We took things too far and we're just retracing some of those gains right now. In my opinion there should still be more retracement. I still think we're in a bear market as far as rates go,&quot; said Posiewko.</p>
<p>Adding to the softness in the money market was a weaker currency. Canada's dollar opened slightly weaker in thin trading at C$1.3797 (US$0.7247) on Wednesday after heavy two-way activity overnight in overseas markets.  </p>
<p>In other prices, the six-month when-issued T-bill softened to yield 3.45 percent from 3.40 percent. The one-year T-bill softened to yield 4.0 percent from 3.94 percent.</p>
<p>The call loan rate traded at 3.0 percent, in the center of the Bank of Canada's 2.75-3.25 percent target range.</p>
