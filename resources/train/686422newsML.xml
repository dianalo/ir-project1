<p>Invacare Corp. Wednesday formally rejected conditions set by hostile takeover target Healthdyne Technologies Inc., saying its move to explore alternatives is &quot;nothing more than a &quot;sham.&quot;</p>
<p>The rejection by Invacare, which has launched a $200 million hostile offer for Healthdyne, confirmed statements made by Invacare Chief Executive Malachi Mixon in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a letter to Healthdyne Chairman Parker Petit, Mixon criticised the Marietta, Ga.-based company's approach to its offer and said it is unlikely that any other serious bidders will emerge.</p>
<p>Healthdyne said Monday it would talk with interested parties about a potential transaction, but set strict conditions on talks with Invacare, including withdrawal of the suitor's hostile bid.</p>
<p>&quot;If Healthdyne's board were serious about third-party transactions, it would declare the company for sale to the highest bidder and commence an auction. The so-called process referred to in Healthdyne's letter falls far short of this,&quot; Mixon said.</p>
<p>Healthdyne has repeatedly rejected Invacare's offer. Invacare initially launched a bid in January and has raised it three times to the current offer of $15 per share.</p>
<p>Invacare, based in Elyria, Ohio, intends to pursue its attempt to oust the board of Healthdyne at the company's annual meeting on July 30.</p>
<p>Healthdyne stock was unchanged at $17 on Nasdaq shortly before midday. Invacare shares slid 12.5 cents to $23.375, also on Nasdaq.</p>
