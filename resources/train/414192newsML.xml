<headline>LIFFE grains up as farmer sellers still reluctant.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE grains rose as an increasing number of would-be buyers failed to entice farmer sellers out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>May dominated trading in wheat, with 467 of the total 773 lots traded.</p>
<p>May wheat last changed hands at 100.10 stg, 1.40 stg higher and its high for the day.</p>
<p>November was the most active contract on barley, with 15 of a total 24 lots traded. It last traded 0.75 stg up at 93.50 stg.</p>
<p>Shipper buying indicated that there is some export optimism, one trader said. But potential sellers held back. &quot;A lot of sellers I might have expected to see didn't want to play,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The strength of futures is closely connected to a firm physical market, others said.</p>
<p>The market is strong despite a poor relative competitive position relative to other origins, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;More people want to buy than want to sell, so you can't stop it going up,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Consumer buyers were short on April/May and were getting nervous, she reckoned.</p>
<p>Farmers, on the other hand, were pretty well sold and were relaxed. The result was a strong market.</p>
<p>&quot;The French market has picked up which helps,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Demand for French wheat at the ports remained strong on Monday, underpinned by buyers looking to cover export needs. &quot;It looks like we're in for another hot week,&quot; one French trader said. He was expecting continued price rises in the face of holding back by sellers.</p>
<p>The picture of a tighter than expected market Europe-wide was underlined by Guy Legras, the European Commission's chief permanent agriculture official.</p>
<p>He predicted on Monday that EU grain consumption would be higher than forecast this season, limiting the amount of grain ending up in intervention.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a very strong increase in (EU) consumption. All the figures...show that there is a stronger increase than expected,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone from Brussels.</p>
