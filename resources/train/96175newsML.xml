<p>Voices within the centre-right minority Czech government have begun to question the stability of monetarist Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's position, but analysts said on Friday it is premature to write him off.</p>
<p>One senior government official, who declined to be named, contended on Friday that Klaus's position in the cabinet had weakened since inconclusive elections in June left the coalition two votes shy of a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>The high-ranking official said Klaus was &quot;on edge&quot; and was behaving like a man &quot;under pressure&quot;.</p>
<p>Recently Klaus has been forced to accept a parliamentary probe of the murky failure of the Plzen-based bank, Kreditni Banka a.s., and has faced a constant barrage of complaints about a yawning trade deficit.</p>
<p>Doubts about Klaus's position have grown wider after several reports this week in the local press quoting sources from within his own Civic Democratic Party (ODS), as saying his post as party chairman may no longer be secure.</p>
<p>Klaus has often been accused of adopting a high-handed attitude to criticism and, in a thinly-veiled reference to Klaus this summer, Foreign Minister and ODS deputy chairman Josef Zieleniec called for more openness in the party.</p>
<p>But officially, the three-party coalition government is keeping a united front.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the government is stable and... has only one way forward -- with its head held high to fulfil the government programme,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, said on Friday.</p>
<p>Klaus has condemned attacks from ODS party members who refuse to be named, as cowardly. Still the impression is growing that Klaus, widely known for his abundant self confidence, is feeling the heat.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a man under a lot of stress,&quot; said political analyst Jiri Pehe of the Prague-based Open Media Research Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there could be some danger to his position... there are a lot of ambitious people in his party. But...ODS was built around him and I can't imagine danger (for Klaus) in the next few weeks,&quot; Pehe said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Klaus issued his most virulent attack yet on opposition Social Democrat (CSSD) leader Milos Zeman who emerged as power broker after the elections and whose tacit support is crucial to the survival of the minority government.</p>
<p>Klaus accused the Social Democrats of joining forces with the other opposition parties, the Communists and ultra-right Republicans, to try to reverse the post-Communist reforms he has led.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Prime Minister said the post-electoral agreement with the Social Democrats did not mean he had signed on to some form of &quot;puppet government&quot;. Zeman replied in kind saying the legislature would not be a &quot;puppet parliament.&quot;</p>
<p>The rising tension between the two leaders come as posturing for November Senate elections and the 1997 state budget debate picks up steam.</p>
<p>The elections to the Senate will be the first test of the new alignment of political forces since the elections to the lower house deprived Klaus's coalition of its majority and made the Social Democrats the second biggest political party.</p>
<p>Recent opinion polls have shown the Social Democrats and ODS virtually deadlocked with around 26 percent support each.</p>
<p>On Czech Television late Thursday, Klaus said the vote on the government's proposed balanced budget, expected in December, could have the character of a vote of confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;De facto&quot; we can take it like that. I do not know if the question will be put this way formally,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zeman said the Social Democrats will demand concessions on energy deregulation, crackdowns on tax evasion and economic crime, as well as cuts in bureaucracy as the price of their support for the budget.</p>
