<p>Several Asian central banks on Thursday cooperated with Thailand by jointly intervening to defend the embattled baht against speculative attacks, Thai deputy central bank governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi said.</p>
<p>	   &quot;The central bank obtained cooperation from several</p>
<p>central banks, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore, today,&quot; Chaiyawat told reporters.</p>
<p>The deputy governor said speculative pressure against the baht eased substantially on Thursday and the Thai currency was mostly traded at 30-40 satangs below the central bank's midrate of 25.81 to the dollar.</p>
<p>The baht was quoted sharply firmer at 25.250/25.350 late on Thursday against 25.910/25.940 early in the morning and 26.330/26.430 late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Thai and Singapore central banks jointly intervened on Wednesday to ward off heavy speculative pressure against the baht. Dealers estimated that the two banks had spent billions of dollars in shoring up the baht.</p>
<p>&quot;Thais should not be carried away by rumours (in foreign markets),&quot; Chaiyawat said referring to recent market concern over a sharply slowing Thai economy and speculation on a possible change of the Thai finance portfolio.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has ruled out any change of his finance minister and key economic team.</p>
<p>The central bank official said the baht's regained stability on Thursday was reflected by increased unwinding by speculators of long dollar positions.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond said later on Thursday his bank agreed to buy over one billion dollars of dollar positions in the spot market, mostly at 25.30 baht to the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank bought over one billion dollars in the spot market...to take profit,&quot; he said.</p>
