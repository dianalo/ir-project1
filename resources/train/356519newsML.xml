<headline>Copper leads markets up, LME ends in plus column.</headline>

<p>Copper prices shook off their midsession blues during more active Wednesday afternoon LME trading, pulling other metals to higher closes.</p>
<p>Traders said there was a knock-on affect from copper extending its move above $2,200, and zinc and nickel reached fresh highs for this current bull-run.</p>
<p>&quot;They (markets) kicked into action again this afternoon, and some of the shorts got nervous,&quot; said Martin Squires of LME trader Rudolf Wiolff and Co.</p>
<p>Apart from copper, there was an influx of trade interest throughout the complex, while investment fund buying re-appeared in the zinc and nickel markets, he noted.</p>
<p>Copper's spread premiums firmed again with cash/three months whipping back above the $200 backwardation level. Nearby prompts continue to trade at or near the $23 daily LME limit - a trend seen continuing up to the Feb date two weeks away.</p>
<p>Earlier, February traded option declarations passed routinely, with the market falling between strikes and thus generating little followthrough excitement.</p>
<p>However, once the options passed by there was some fresh buying, which eventually lifted prices up to the $2,240 level by Wednesday's kerb close, up $36 from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fund interest helped zinc move through the previous high and tough resistance in the mid-$1,170s, although there is further overhead supply stretching up to $1,200. Last trade was at $1,184, just off an $1,190 peak, but up $15 from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nickel momentarily broke above the important chart point of $7,820 on speculative buying, before settling back to close the session at $7,810, still up $125.</p>
<p>Aluminium similarly advanced during the afternoon rings, but again ran into tough resistance above $1,625. Nevertheless the close at $1,632, up from an overnight $1,617.50, suggests that there will be another re-test of $1,640 soon.</p>
<p>Lead inched higher, with this market continuing to trade routinely, and last business was at $681, up just $3. Tin also crawled higher, and finished at $5,860, only $5 up from the overnight kerb.</p>
<p>The alloy market closed at a slightly higher $1,535/40 a tonne. --Martin Hayes, London Newsroom 44 171 542 8080</p>
