<p>Canada's privately held Blackburn Group put most of its media assets on the block Wednesday, including the London (Ontario) Free Press newspaper that the Blackburn family has held for 148 years.</p>
<p>Citing fierce competition from large media chains, the group said it also sought to sell its CFPL AM and FM radio stations in London, and Netmar, Canada's biggest publisher of weekly shopper publications.</p>
<p>&quot;They make up the bulk of our media assets,&quot; Blackburn Media president Sandy Green said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>He said media consolidation made it tough for a small independent operator to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Conrad Black's Hollinger group is Canada's largest newspaper chain, with a direct or indirect stake in about 40 percent of Canadian newspaper circulation through its own properties and its majority stake in Southam Inc.</p>
<p>Analysts said Southam would be the logical buyer of the London Free Press, while Toronto-based CHUM Ltd. may look at the radio stations.</p>
<p>One analyst, who asked not to be identified, said Netmar could be a good fit for G.T.C. Transcontinental Group Ltd., Quebecor Inc. or Torstar Corp.'s Metroland subsidiary.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are interested,&quot; Southam Associate Chief Executive David Radler told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>He said he had not seen any financial information about the newspaper and would know better when detailed data become available.</p>
<p>&quot;But at this point I know nothing. I've seen nothing...I think it does fit well with Southam. There's no question of that,&quot; added Radler, who is also president and chief operating officer of Hollinger Inc. and Southam's majority shareholder Hollinger International Inc.</p>
