<title>FRANCE: TV rivals go to war for French film rights.</title>
<headline>TV rivals go to war for French film rights.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>A new war has broken out between the arch rivals of French television, Canal Plus and Television par Satellite (TPS), over pre-purchasing films made by French producers for showing on their channels.</p>
<p>In interviews with separate journals published last Friday, top officials of each company set out their battle lines.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not going to pay to make and promote a film which will be run straight afterwards by my competitor,&quot; Canal Plus chairman Pierre Lescure told fortnightly magazine Le Film Francais.</p>
<p>Under the headline &quot;TPS counter-attacks&quot;, daily newspaper Le Figaro quoted TPS managing director Cyrille du Peloux accusing Canal Plus of telling producers not to sell film rights to TPS.</p>
<p>&quot;To counter this block, TPS chose to move into pre-purchasing for all segments of pay television -- pay-per-view, first and second run. We are therefore moving onto the offensive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>TPS has just clinched its first pre-purchase deals, buying exclusive rights for first and second run and non-exclusive rights for pay-per-view for two French films, du Peloux said.</p>
<p>He said TPS spent 13.5 million francs ($2.4 million) on pre-purchasing Droit dans le Mur, a comedy by French actor Pierre Richard, and 16.5 million francs for Voleur de vie with French actress Emmanuelle Beart.</p>
<p>Other announcements are due to follow in the next few weeks, a TPS spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>For its part, pay TV group Canal Plus has just signed an accord with French film production studios in which it holds less than 15 percent, under which it would pre-purchase 75 percent of its first-run films from them from the year 2000.</p>
<p>What stings Canal Plus, a channel dedicated to giving special coverage to films, is that another pay TV channel should snap up and run a film just after it has run on Canal Plus.</p>
<p>&quot;This idea of an encoded second run amounts to a transfer of riches from Canal Plus to TPS... if they want to second run, they must also buy the first run. That is real competition,&quot; Lescure told Le Film Francais.</p>
<p>TPS, which has set aside a budget of over 100 million francs for buying rights to French films, says Canal Plus is reacting badly to finding itself with a competitor.</p>
<p>TPS, a digital satellite television service operated by private French television station TF1, was launched last December.</p>
<p>Canal Plus, which broadcasts on a terrestrial channel to its subscribers, launched its digital satellite service, Canalsatellite, in April 1996.</p>
<p>The TPS spokeswoman said Canal Plus tended to amalgamate its terrestrial and satellite operations when talking about film rights, while TPS was a competitor only to its satellite unit.</p>
<p>The two rivals regularly engage in a war of words, battles which sometimes spill over into the courts or Parliament.</p>
<p>Canal Plus is campaigning to get the right to broadcast French public TV channels France 2 and France 3 on its satellite service. At the moment TPS has exclusive rights to carry them.</p>
<p>Before being dissolved for the French elections, Parliament was debating a broadcasting bill which would rule on this issue.</p>
<p>Each TV channel accuses the other of being at fault in preventing them from devising compatible decoders.</p>
<p>Canal Plus has also taken TF1 Publicite, the advertising arm of TF1, to court over alleged uncompetitive practices.</p>
<p>The ultimate battle is for subscribers. TPS last month said it had over 116,000 subscribers, and expects to have 300,000 by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Canalsatellite said in April it had 300,000 digital subcribers and aimed to have 500,000 by end-1997. ($ = 5.681 French Francs)</p>
