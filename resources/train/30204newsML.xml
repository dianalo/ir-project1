<p>Indian telecommunications firms -- lured by the world's largest capital market -- are opting to raise equity by issuing American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), investment bankers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;ADRs allow a company to tap a much broader investor base and a listing in the U.S. gives the company higher visibility,&quot; said an investment banker at a U.S. bank in Bombay.</p>
<p>Investment bankers say fledgling Indian telecom companies including Hutchison Max Telecom, Bharati Telecom and a BPL group firm plan to raise some $500 million through ADRs.</p>
<p>Indian firms have traditionally raised international equity through global depositary receipts (GDRs) which do not have access to retail investors across the United States.</p>
<p>But aggressive marketing by American investment banks promising greater access to investors and the prestige of a Nasdaq listing are making some firms opt for ADRs.</p>
<p>&quot;Since an ADR requires a much higher standard of accounting and disclosure than a GDR and since it undergoes an extensive due-diligence process, it is seen as an investment that is potentially more attractive,&quot; said the banker at the U.S. investment bank.</p>
<p>A presentation by Citibank N.A. said U.S. investments in international equities rose sharply to an estimated $350 billion in 1995 from $17 billion in 1981.</p>
<p>&quot;ADRs allow access to retail investors and the smaller, more aggressive growth funds which don't qualify for QIB (qualified institutional buyer) status,&quot; said an investment banker associated with one of the forthcoming issues.</p>
<p>British-based investment banks are fighting back.</p>
<p>A written presentation by a British-based firm questioned the necessity of targeting U.S. retail investors.</p>
<p>&quot;Focusing on QIBs is more rewarding than blanket bombing the retail investors,&quot; the presentation said.</p>
<p>It said U.S. investors regard Mexico as a role model for emerging markets worldwide but are cautious due to repeated losses in Mexico and Latin America.</p>
<p>British-based investment bankers say American retail investors are typically short-term players with a limited understanding of markets outside the United States and add that the costs and legal ramifications of an ADR far outweigh its advantages.</p>
<p>They estimate direct costs (excluding listing fees and roadshow costs) of ADRs to be sharply higher at $1.0 to $1.5 million against $350,000-$500,000 for GDRs.</p>
<p>&quot;The fees are higher but the company has a choice and doesn't have to go with the adviser that offers a U.S. listing,&quot; said a Singapore-based U.S. investment banker.</p>
