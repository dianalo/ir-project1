<p>European Monetary Institute (EMI) President Alexandre Lamfalussy said Sunday he expected a euro-denominated government debt market to develop rapidly once the European single currency had been introduced.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe we will see fast development of a large, liquid euro-denominated market in government assets,&quot; Lamfalussy told a foreign exchange conference, adding he thought it would be &quot;quicker than most of us would expect.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the question remained how and when existing government stock would be redenominated in euros. &quot;I don't know how fast this will happen,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>But he added that as governments began issuing debt in euros after the start of the single currency -- planned for 1999 -- &quot;I don't see how they can start issuing new debt in euros without redenominating outstanding debt in euros.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, the development of that market could make a substantial shift in the relationship between the euro and the U.S. dollar, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. authorities will have to watch more carefully than they have done the potential weakness of the dollar.&quot; This is going to introduce the kind of relation between the U.S., Europe and Japan &quot;that may mean fundamental change,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said while it was highly improbable there would be anything other than a floating rate system between the large currencies of the world, &quot;that doesn't mean we shouldn't care about exchange rate relations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In order to be able to have an impact through these adjustments on exchange rates...You cannot do it just on one side, and this is the change which is likely to happen with the introduction of the euro,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The EMI is the forerunner of the future European Central Bank.</p>
