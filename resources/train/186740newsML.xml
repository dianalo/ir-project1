<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares closed holding onto midday gains on Wednesday that saw the AEX index of leading stocks push above the key 600 point barrier for the first time.</p>
<p>The AEX index finished at a fresh all-time closing high of 602.02 points, up 4.43 points on the day and beating the previous record of 597.59 scored on Tuesday. The market ended at the day's high also setting a new intra-day record.</p>
<p>Heavyweight banking groups ABN AMRO and ING both featured highly in the volume list as the steady tone to domestic bonds pushed investors towards them. The two closed up 0.60 and 0.30 guilders respectively at 101.50 and 57.40.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, insurer Aegon put in a good performance ahead of its nine month results on Friday. The life insurer added 3.50 guilders to end at 94.70. Analysts are expecting profits to rise by a consensus 16.2 percent to 1,096 million guilders.</p>
<p>Food and drinks group Unilever also fared well, adding another 2.90 guilders to 279.50 after gaining on Tuesday, when brokers ING Barings upgraded the stock to a hold from sell on the back of better prospects in European and U.S. markets.</p>
<p>Options played a part in the index move as market makers initially tried to keep it below 600 points to protect their positions. They were forced to cover once the level was broken.  </p>
<p>A late flurry of buying linked to short-covering from options holders pushed the AEX index up over a point in hectic late trade, allowing it to shrug off a weaker Wall Street.</p>
<p>But many in the market remain wary particularly ahead of the today's Federal Reserve meeting in the United States, which is due to end at 1915 GMT. Dealers said a decision to change U.S. rates either way could take the shine off the Dutch market as either the dollar or Wall Street correct.</p>
<p>But most were expecting a no change decision after the data suggesting benign U.S. inflation released on Wednesday and said this could be the trigger for fresh buying tomorrow.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we get the decision we want from the Fed (no change in rates), then you may see a scramble tomorrow,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Some dealers were targeting a push to the 610 level in the near-term but also saying this could increase the vulnerability of slip back to around 595 points before steadying.</p>
<p>The longer-term target remains between 625 and 630 points, although dealers conceded with the index in uncharted territory, predicting targets was becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
