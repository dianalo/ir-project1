<p>U.S. Treasuries ended higher for the fourth straight session Tuesday, helped by technical factors and the additional credence being given to the view that the economy will slow considerably in the second quarter, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's technicals and the changing view about the dynamics of underlying demand in the economy,&quot; said Matthew Alexy, chief markets strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended at 96-29/32, up 12/32, to yield 6.87 percent.  </p>
<p>Two-year note rose 2/32 to 100-4/32, with the yield falling to 6.18 percent from 6.22 percent at Monday's close.</p>
<p>William Hornbarger, fixed-income strategist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Co, said bonds benefitted from the view that &quot;we're seeing measurable signs of slowing in the second quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>The leading economic indicators index slipped 0.1 percent in April, as expected. But two private measures of store sales for the week ended on May 31 were rather weak, analysts said.</p>
<p>Many economist have also cut their estimates for non-farm payroll growth in May.  </p>
<p>Aspects of National Association of Purchasing Management's (NAPM) May report threw some cold water on the slowing economy scenario, analysts admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;But the bigger number right now, this week, is the May payroll employment number,&quot; said Hornbarger. &quot;As recently as a week ago, you had people fearing a very strong number. Now the forecasts are much softer than they were a week or two ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters on Monday predicted on average that 219,000 new jobs were added to non-farm payrolls in May.  </p>
<p>Chris Rupkey, vice president and financial economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, said the NAPM report Monday, with its lengthened supplier delivery times and jump in unfilled orders, should have been bad news for the bond market.</p>
<p>&quot;We behaved well on bad news -- which is the hallmark of a bullish market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rupkey said a potentially softer EMU, the relative firmness of U.S. interest rates and swap demand all seemed to support the case for being long U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>In addition, there's the danger of a softer than expected May payroll employment report this Friday, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The danger is if the number comes in soft on Friday, the market will blow upwards and there will be people left behind,&quot; said Rupkey.</p>
<p>Alexy said the market's tone had become more constructive based on the conviction that the economy's fast growth pace in the first quarter was not sustainable and that second quarter growth would be weak enough to push any Fed interest rate hike farther out into the future.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the bond yield at the close on Tuesday was very close to where that yield stood before the last payroll employment report, Alexy said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The curve is a little steeper,&quot; Alexy added. &quot;The two-year (note) yield is about seven basis points lower than where it was before the last payroll report.&quot;</p>
<p>Alexy said if the theory of the Fed not having to raise interest rates anymore gains adherents and if the economy is self-correcting, the May retail sales data due next week and the May Consumer Price Index (CPI) could push yields lower.</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury note ended at 100-1/32, up 9/32, to yield 6.62 percent. Five-year Treasury notes ended at 100-4/32, yielding 6.47 percent. Three-month bill rates ended at 4.96 percent, six-month rates ended at 5.18 percent and year bill rates closed at 5.44 percent.</p>
