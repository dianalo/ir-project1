<p>Following are views on the direction of Philippine stocks on Monday and main factors likely to affect trading.</p>
<p>* Philippine stocks are likely to mount a technical rebound after five straight days of losses last week, says Dharmala Securities Phils Inc analyst Eliza Salvatierra.</p>
<p>She says the local market may  also take a cue from the 48-point rise of the Dow Jones last Friday.</p>
<p>* The composite index is expected to find its resistance at the 3,150 level, said Sapphire Securities analyst Henry Ong.  </p>
<p>* Sapphire's Ong said he expected investors to pick up Empire East, Megaworld and Centennial City after these have fallen to &quot;attractive levels.</p>
<p>* The Philippine composite index closed on Friday at 3,060.59 points, down 44.18.</p>
<p>* The peso closed at 26.365 to a U.S. dollar on Friday from 26.37.</p>
<p>* The Philippine interbank call loan average was unchanged at 9.9375 percent.  </p>
<p>* The Dow ended 48.72 points higher at 6,526.07, but for the week it dropped 214.52 points -- the fourth largest after October 13, 1989's fall of 216.26.</p>
<p>* Philippine merchandise exports in the first two months of the year grew by 16.2 percent to $3.503 billion compared with $3.014 billion in the same period in 1996, state-agency National Statistics Office said on Saturday.</p>
<p>* Universal Rightfield Property Holdings Inc said on Saturday it expected its net income to hit 1.025 billion pesos from 414 million last year.</p>
