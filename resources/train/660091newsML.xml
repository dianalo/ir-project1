<title>NIGERIA: Nigeria cancels contracts of U.S. oil firm Ashland.</title>
<headline>Nigeria cancels contracts of U.S. oil firm Ashland.</headline>
<dateline>ABUJA, Nigeria</dateline>
<text>
<p>Nigeria Friday cancelled Ashland Corp.'s oil production contracts in this West African country, accusing it of transferring its interests to a third party without official consent.</p>
<p>An Oil Ministry statement in the capital Abuja said the move was ordered by Oil Minister Dan Etete.</p>
<p>&quot;The production-sharing contracts are hereby terminated with immediate effect,&quot; it said. &quot;All work permits and expatriate quota granted to staff of Ashland based on their petroleum operations in the country are hereby revoked and withdrawn.&quot;</p>
<p>No senior official of Ashland was available to comment but an Oil Ministry official said it meant the end of Ashland's business in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The order capped a tempestuous week for oil companies in Nigeria, a day after Etete criticised oil giant Royal Dutch Shell Group at a meeting in Abuja, accusing it of frustrating Nigeria's $4 billion liquefied natural gas project.</p>
<p>Etete has clashed with oil companies since last year when he accused them of not involving Nigerians in their businesses.</p>
<p>Ashland has been involved in Nigeria since the 1970s. It signed its first oil deal in the country in 1973 and the last in 1991 but its operations are relatively small compared to Shell and the other U.S. oil companies, Chevron Corp., Mobil Corp. and Texaco Inc.</p>
