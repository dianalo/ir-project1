<p>East Asia's tiger economies that have climbed from rags to riches are emerging as net foreign direct investors but they are paying little attention to Europe, a U.N. survey said on Friday.</p>
<p>Europe has only a five percent share of the investment flows coming from Asia's increasingly affluent economies.</p>
<p>They are keeping the bulk of their capital within Asia but are also lured to the United States, said the survey from UNCTAD, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.</p>
<p>European foreign direct investment in Asia's expanding markets also lags behind its trade rivals, Japan and the United States, with a share of only one percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe's share in the total is peanuts. It is not even a destination for the average transnational Asian direct investor abroad,&quot; said Zbigniew Zimny, a senior UNCTAD economist.</p>
<p>The survey said Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan were now net outward foreign direct investors, but two-thirds of East Asia's capital flows stayed in the region where firms with no experience of Europe felt at home and shared a common culture.</p>
<p>Another trend was that regional investors favoured manufacturing for domestic consumers, particularly in China, while Korea and Taiwan were aggressively increasing their direct investment in the United States.</p>
<p>The survey was based on figures gathered by several international bodies, including the World Bank and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. It was commissioned by the government of Thailand.</p>
<p>Although UNCTAD predicted an upsurge in foreign direct investment from Asia into Europe, it gave no projections and focused on historical trends.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is now the world's fourth biggest direct investor overseas after the United States, Britain and Germany, it said.</p>
<p>It accounted for 52 percent of all East and Southeast Asian direct foreign investments, and had $25 billion invested abroad as of 1995, the latest year for which data was available. Total global direct investment was worth $315 billion. More than half of this amount went to China.</p>
<p>Taiwan, East Asia's second largest direct investor overseas with some $24 billion, had a third of its outward investments in the United States and a sizeable chunk in China via Hong Kong. Only $500 million was invested in Europe, the survey said.</p>
<p>Singapore was the third largest investor abroad with nearly $14 billion in outward investment stocks in 1994, followed by Korea with $11 billion.</p>
<p>The survey said East Asian investment in the 15 nations of the European Union, mainly in manufacturing and electronics, had jumped to $860 million a year on average from $100 million late in 1980s. But governments needed to do more to lure funds, UNCTAD said.</p>
<p>The region's trade with Europe's low-growth, low-saving and saturated economies remained mainly in the form of exports rather than direct investment in joint ventures. Direct Asian capital in Europe favoured Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>East Asian countries wanted to expand in Europe, but they faced competitive constraints in manufacturing, banking and communications areas and needed to introduce new technologies.</p>
<p>&quot;Asian industrialising countries are at the gates of Europe. Asian foreign direct investment in Europe needs to be nurtured. Governments have a role to play,&quot; the survey said.</p>
