<title>USA: NY precious metals called to open mixed.</title>
<headline>NY precious metals called to open mixed.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures were called to open mixed Wednesday, with gold expected to weaken further but the rest of the complex seen little changed.</p>
<p>Higher real U.S. interest rates following the Fed's credit tightening in March, combined with Tuesday's lower-than-expected rise in U.S. March consumer prices are pressuring gold, analysts said.</p>
<p>In addition, with gold prices in Australian dollar and South African rand back down near the year's lows, more producer hedging is seen as possible.  </p>
<p>But gold prices in Indian rupees are also back down near the year's lows and the second wedding season lies ahead, which should support physical offtake, analysts added.</p>
<p>COMEX June gold was called unchanged to off $0.20 from Tuesday's close of $344.10 an ounce after trading from $344.20 to $344.10 on ACCESS.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted early at $340.50/$341.00 against the London morning fix of $341.45 and the New York close Tuesday of $341.70/$342.20.</p>
<p>COMEX gold stocks were unchanged Tuesday at 1,032,382 ounces.</p>
<p>COMEX silver stocks fell 37 ounces to 190,537,272 ounces Tuesday.</p>
<p>COMEX May silver was called unchanged to up 0.2 cent from the previous close of $4.710 after trading from $4.71 to $4.72 on ACCESS.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum and NYMEX June palladium were called little changed from their Tuesday closes of $367.50 and $150.10, respectively.</p>
