<title>CANADA: Corriente rises ahead of drill program.</title>

<p>Corriente Resources Inc continued to climb on Monday, rising to its highest point ever on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Shares in the Vancouver-based mining exploration company were up C$1.40 to C$16.45 by early afternoon. The stock has risen steadily from about C$4 at the end of October.</p>
<p>The company has not had any news in the past few days, but comments about the company in newsletters and growing investor interest in drill programs set to start in the new year have helped push the stock up, company spokesman Dan Carriere said in a phone interview from Vancouver.  </p>
<p>Corriente plans to set up two drill rigs on its Chama bulk-tonnage gold project in central Peru and will advance drilling on its Taca Taca copper properties in Argentina, Carriere said.</p>
<p>He said the company would hold off on advancing its interest in the Samenta copper property in Argentina until it has heard from an Argentina judge on January 15.</p>
<p>The property is caught up in a boundary dispute between Corriente and Mansfield Minerals Inc. A  judge confirmed Corriente's claims to the property earlier this month and gave Corriente the right to explore without interference from Mansfield.</p>
<p>But Mansfield has appealed the ruling.</p>
<p>Corriente will be told on January 15 if it can go ahead with exploration during the appeal process, Carriere said.</p>
