<p>Israeli finance ministry officials say the key aim of the country's debut Eurobond -- due for launch on Thursday -- would be to set a benchmark that would enable other Israeli entities to follow suit.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists on Wednesday prior to a presentation to bankers and other potential investors, the officials said the offering would be for $200 million, mature after five-years, and yield around 50 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't need the money, but want to establish a benchmark so borrowers from the business sector can raise funds,&quot; Israeli ministry of finance director-general David Brodet said.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to be located in all the financial markets,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Other members of the Israeli delegation included the Treasury accountant general Shy Talmon, the senior deputy accountant general Avi Elkind and the minister of economic affairs for the embassy of Israel in London Shlomo Maoz.</p>
<p>They said early next year Israel would launch a Samurai bond worth around $200 million. The country also had intentions to tap the French franc, mark and sterling sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;The story of the Israeli economy is in a good shape. It is running a very European-style economy,&quot; Brodet said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a unique situation, our growth rate is like the emerging countries, like the tigers, but in terms of sophistication we are like the Western developed countries. This combination is very attractive for investors.&quot;</p>
<p>On Israeli politics he said: &quot;We are dealing with sophisticated investors, they understand the basic advantages of Israel, they understand that Israel is committed to the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>The Eurobond will be the first to be issued under Israel's $750 million Euro medium-term note programme and the second Israeli offering without the backing of U.S. loan guarantees.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's rated the issue A- on Monday. Israel is rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p>In December 1995 Israel launched a $250 million 10-year Yankee bond to yield 76 b.p. over U.S. Treasury notes.</p>
<p>&quot;The spread has bounced around as tight as 67 and as wide as 80 b.p. over (U.S. Treasury notes),&quot; Merrill Lynch director of debt capital market services Patrick Currie said, adding spreads in Israel's borrowing costs had been tightening.</p>
<p>Merrill lynch was awarded the mandate in May this year to lead manage the Eurobond transaction.</p>
<p>Currie said some of the demand for the Eurobond would come from Asia, but the bulk of the demand would be in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel does not need the money so the object of the exercise is to develop the European investor base,&quot; Currie said.</p>
<p>&quot;As Israel's economy grows in size, there will also be Israeli companies looking to come to the market and it is important to have a benchmark transaction against which they can be priced.&quot;</p>
