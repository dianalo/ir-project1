<p>Larry Mize used a new putter  and a new attitude to take the lead after his first round at the $1.7  million Sprint International on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mize compiled eight birdies and one bogey for a seven-under- par 65  in ideal morning conditions at Castle Pines near Denver.</p>
<p>&quot;I putted with a new putter today and I had a good attitude with it,&quot;  said Mize, who received 15 points in the modified stableford format  which awards points for birdies and better and subtracts points for  bogey and worse.</p>
<p>Mize led by one point from fellow-American Phil Mickelson, while Dave  Stockton junior was three points behind.</p>
<p>Afternoon thunderstorms prevented half the field of 72 players from  completing the round, which was scheduled to resume early Friday.</p>
<p>Best of those unable to complete the round was Jay Haas, on 10 points  after five birdies in just eight holes.</p>
<p>Mize, 93rd on this year's PGA Tour money list, is regarded as one  of the best putters in the game, but he hasn't been at his best lately.</p>
<p>Four birdies in the first seven holes, however, did wonders for his  confidence, and he followed up with four more birdies on the back  nine, before bogeying the last.</p>
<p>&quot;I hit a lot of good mid-iron shots and gave myself a lot of putts  for birdie,&quot; said the 1987 Masters champion. &quot;Conditions were ideal  with hardly a breath of wind.&quot;</p>
<p>Mickelson, meanwhile, did his Ryder Cup chances no harm with a strong  round that included one eagle, five birdies and one bogey.</p>
<p>He has slipped to ninth spot on the U.S. Ryder Cup rankings and, with  just three events left before the team to take on Europe is finalised,  is far from assured of a berth.</p>
<p>The top 10 players after the PGA Championship will receive automatic  selection, while captain Tom Kite will pick two others to complete  the American team to take on Cup holder Europe at Valderrama (September  26-28).</p>
<p>&quot;I honestly believed after winning Bay Hill (in March) that I had  secured a spot on the Ryder Cup team,&quot; said Mickelson, who has not  picked up any points in the past three months.</p>
<p>&quot;I've played well, but I have not scored well. I just haven't had  enough top 10 finishes. A good finish here could secure a spot and  that's what I'm hoping for. With only three more events, it's definitely  something I'm thinking about.&quot;</p>
