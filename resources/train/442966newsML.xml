<p>The Federal Trade Commission voted 4-1 earlier this week to challenge the first proposed merger deal between Staples and Office Depot because they found it to be &quot;fundamentally flawed,&quot; a top FTC official said Friday.</p>
<p>But William Baer, director of the FTC Bureau of Competition, gave no indication of how the commissioners may react to a new proposal under which the chains agreed to divest 63 stores.  </p>
<p>Baer was speaking during a panel discussion at Georgetown University Law School, along with the acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Joel Klein.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a point at which the agencies have to be prepared to just say no, where we think on balance the transaction is fundamentally flawed. And we need to be prepared to go to court to defend our rights,&quot; Baer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We did it last year in a merger involving Rite-Aid and Revco that would have created the ... country's largest pharmacy chain. And we did that earlier this week when we decided to challenge the Staples-Office Depot merger,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>After the speech, Baer declined to amplify his remarks or say whether commissioners believe the deal continues to be fundamentally flawed, now that OfficeMax has agreed to purchase 63 stores.  </p>
<p>Don Baker, a former assistant attorney general for antitrust who is now in private practice with Baker &amp; Miller PLLC in Washington, said &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; did not have a specific legal meaning.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no term of art,&quot; Baker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes that means it is just simply unfixable and sometimes it means such a large divestiture is needed that it would be highly unlikely that the problem can be solved by divestiture,&quot; he said. But he offered no predictions on what the FTC may do next.</p>
<p>And Eleanor Fox, a professor of law at New York University Law School, said flatly: &quot;The tea leaves cannot be read.&quot;</p>
<p>She said the FTC may accept a deal if it gets an agreement assuring there will be no increase in prices. But, she said, &quot;that puts a lot of stress on the word 'fundamentally.'&quot;</p>
