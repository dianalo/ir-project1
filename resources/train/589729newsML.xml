<headline>Bulgaria lev closes further down after rate cut.</headline>

<p>The Bulgarian lev slumped to around 1,685-1,700 per dollar on the interbank market at Friday's close from midday's 1,565-1,570 as dollar demand for short-covering after a main rate cut outstripped supply, dealers said.</p>
<p>The lev opened at 1,543-1,545, down from 1,534-1,536 at Thursday's close after the central bank said it would lower its main interest rate to 4.29 percent monthly from 5.20 percent from Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign currency demand was running high throughout the day due to massive shortcovering after the central bank cut its main interest rate. Supply was mainly from final clients and in very thin volumes,&quot; a bank dealer said.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) on Thursday said it would cut its main interest rate to 4.29 percent monthly from 5.20 percent, effective from Monday.</p>
<p>The cut would further pare yields on lev-denominated, floating interest government securities, which have attracted foreign investors since March, traders said.</p>
<p>The main interest rate stood at 18 percent monthly in March and has steadily fallen since then.</p>
<p>Those investors were a major source of foreign currency supply in the past two months but now most of them were not offering dollars for levs, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers also said some foreign investors which have locked up levs in treasury paper are now selling the paper ahead of maturity dates and taking the dollars.</p>
<p>Interest on local floating interest T-bills is pegged to the main interest rate and falls with each rate cut during the period to maturity of the paper.</p>
<p>Banks had an ample lev liquidity on Friday after the finance ministry rejected 77 billion lev worth of bids for short-term government securities in the past two days, central bank figures showed.</p>
