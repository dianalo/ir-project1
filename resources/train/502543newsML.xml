<headline>Vietnam says deadlocked with China in oil dispute.</headline>

<p>Vietnam said on Friday that no common ground had been found during three days of talks in Beijing over competing claims to an offshore area where China positioned an oil rig last month.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry spokesman said the Kan Tan 111 rig had been moved out of Vietnamese territorial waters, but called on China not to allow a repetition of the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of the negotiations the two sides have a better understanding of each other's point of view. However, regrettably no common perception of this issue was reached,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that a similar incident will not be repeated in future, which might make the situation more complicated and cause impact on relations between the two countries and stability in the region,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Earlier the two communist neighbours wrapped up three days of talks in Beijing aimed at resolving the dispute which erupted last month after the rig was positioned in waters between central Vietnam and China's Hainan island.</p>
<p>China's main offshore oil firm said last week it was pulling the rig from the area after the vessel had completed its planned exploration work. Vietnamese officials have said it was withdrawn on April 1.</p>
<p>Beijing said on Thursday that expert-level talks had resulted in greater understanding of each other's positions but warned that differences would take time to iron out.</p>
<p>But China's Foreign Ministry made no comment on the outcome of the talks, simply saying that the two sides had exchanged views &quot;in a friendly and frank atmosphere.&quot;</p>
<p>Chinese officials said that leaders of the teams from the two sides met in a Beijing hotel, with other delegation members excluded from the final round.</p>
<p>The potential mineral riches of territory contested by Hanoi and Beijing have been a constant threat to recent efforts by both sides to boost ties. Both nations claim parts of the Tonkin Gulf and the Paracel and Spratly island chains.</p>
<p>China and Vietnam fought a bloody border war in 1979 and clashed at sea in the 1980s.</p>
<p>China and Vietnam normalised diplomatic ties in 1991, but regular talks to resolve land and sea demarcation differences have made little noticeable progress.</p>
