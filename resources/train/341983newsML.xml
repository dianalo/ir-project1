<p>Maine Gov. Angus King Tuesday proposed doubling the state's cigarette tax and using some of the revenue to remove 150,000 low-wage residents from the state's income tax rolls.</p>
<p>King also called for establishing &quot;firm targets&quot; on state and local tax collections that would eventually reduce the percentage of personal income spent on those taxes from 12.3 percent to 11 percent.</p>
<p>The governor told lawmakers in Augusta that while Maine had finally recovered from the recession of the early 1990s it must now bring down its income tax burden to compete in the global economy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am absolutely convinced that high taxes are the biggest drag on the Maine economy,&quot; King said in his annual &quot;State of the State&quot; address.</p>
<p>King proposed hiking the cigarette tax to 74 cents per pack from 37 cents per pack. The revenue would allow the state to drop low-income workers from the tax rolls and bring its personal income exemption &quot;in line&quot; with the federal level, he said.</p>
<p>Citing statistics King said Maine has the highest percentage of young smokers in the country and that 2,300 of its residents die a year from smoking-related illness. He said some of the money should also be used on anti-smoking efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a small town a year wiped out ... We can't let that happen,&quot; King said, at one point emotionally recounting conversations he had 23 years ago with a man dying of throat cancer.</p>
<p>The governor defended a proposal in his current budget to delay a cap in income tax revenues, and urged lawmakers pushing for larger tax cuts to be &quot;patient&quot; while state spending is cut.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't eat a hippopotamus in one sitting,&quot; said King, adding that by controling state spending the economy will be able to grow and that will allow additional tax cuts in the future.</p>
<p>King is the nation's only independent governor, and legislative Democrats and Republicans gave a mixed response to his speech and proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there was a lot of talk about controlling spending and growing the state's economy ... what we want to see are the details,&quot; Senate President Mark Lawrence, a Democrat, told Maine Public Radio.</p>
<p>Senate minority leader Rep. Jane Amero, a Republian, was pleased King said taxes were too high, but she said he was breaking a promise with taxpayers by calling for a delay in the cap on income tax revenues.</p>
