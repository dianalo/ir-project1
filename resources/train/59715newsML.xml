<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Concerns in Australia's mineral sands - ABARE.</title>

<p>The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) said on Tuesday there were signs of uncertainty in the overall performance of Australia's mineral sands sector.</p>
<p>Titanium prices would continue to decline in 1996/97 (to June 30), reflecting weaker demand and oversupply and would prompt production cutbacks, ABARE said in its September quarter commodities outlook. Titanium prices are forecast to decline by five percent in 1996/97, the bureau said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The continued decline in titanium pigment prices, evident since late 1995, has raised significant concerns among producers regarding short-to-medium term pigment supply-demand balances,&quot; ABARE said. &quot;Producers are looking at the situation closely, and some companies have announced production cutbacks,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>ABARE cited the deferral at SCM Chemicals' Kemerton titanium pigment plant at Bunbury, Western Australia, to expand the plant from 80,000 tonnes to 190,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>&quot;Further capacity rationalistion are expected to be undertaken by other producers over the next six months to correct the persistent market imbalance, as increasing pressure is placed on higher cost producers such as those in Japan,&quot; ABARE said.</p>
<p>In contrast, ABARE said that zircon prices are forecast to rise by 26 percent in 1996/97, after a 70 percent jump in 1995/96. &quot;The zircon market is expected to remain tight in the short term, reflecting supply side constraints and continued strong world demand,&quot; ABARE said.  </p>
<p>ABARE said ilmenite and synthetic rutile production is also forecast to rise substantially in 1996/97, following solid gains in 1995/96.</p>
<p>The bureau cited the commissioning of the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd Beenup ilmenite-zircon mine in mid-1996 and the expansion at Westralian Sands' synthetic rutile plant at North Capel.</p>
<p>In contrast, Australia's production of natural rutile, zircon and leucoxene declined significantly in 1995/96 and is expected to further decline in 1996/97 as producers struggle to maintain production levels against falling grades, ABARE said.  </p>
<p>However, Australian mineral sands exports are forecast to rise by 10 percent to over A$1.0 billion in 1996/97, following a 19 percent rise in 1995/96, reflecting strong prices and increases in ilmenite and synthetic rutile exports, ABARE said.</p>
