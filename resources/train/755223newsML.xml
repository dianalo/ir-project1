<title>JAPAN: Nomura president admits illegal deal for 'sokaiya'.</title>
<headline>Nomura president admits illegal deal for 'sokaiya'.</headline>

<p>Nomura Securities Co Ltd president Junichi Ujiie on Thursday admitted allegations made by Japan's securities watchdog last week of illegal stock transactions for &quot;sokaiya&quot; corporate racketeer Ryuichi Koike.</p>
<p>The admission by Ujiie was made at a hearing held at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in a government procedure before the ministry imposes administrative penalties against scandal-hit Nomura.  </p>
<p>Ujiie said Nomura, Japan's largest brokerage, will improve in-house controls after it found several executives were involved in illegal securities transactions.</p>
<p>&quot;We will work out improvement measures and carry them out as soon as possible,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>A ministry official told Ujiie at the hearing that MOF would impose penalties against Nomura as the ministry had confirmed the brokerage's violation of the Securities and Exchange Law through the hearing.</p>
<p>Ujiie replied: &quot;We will accept administrative penalties sincerely.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ujiie admitted allegations by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) that Nomura provided the racketeer Koike with about 47.5 million yen worth of benefits by transferring profits earned on its own dealings between January and June 1995.</p>
<p>He also admitted that Nomura gave Koike about 2.2 million yen in benefits through illicit warrant transactions in March 1995.</p>
<p>He also basically admitted that Nomura provided the racketeer with 320 million yen in cash in March 1995 but said that the cash payment was made under off-balance sheet arrangements and it was difficult for Nomura to clearly confirm how the cash was raised.</p>
<p>But he added that former executives were involved in the cash payment and the company could not object to the allegation that Nomura provided funds on its assets to the racketeer.  </p>
<p>Asked Nomura's perception about why illegal discretionary deals were conducted to provide profits to the racketeer, Ujiie said there were irregular operations inside Nomura to transfer profits earned by Nomura's own stock dealings to accounts related to Koike.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if former executives ordered (such irregular operations), (ordinary) officials were involved in such operations without feeling any serious concerns,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had serious problems in our in-house control system, so we are now working out details to prevent a recurrence (of irregular deals),&quot; he told the hearing.</p>
