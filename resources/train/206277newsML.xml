<headline>Communist leader doubts Yeltsin's ability to work.</headline>

<p>The leader of Russia's opposition Communist Party on Thursday questioned President Boris Yeltsin's ability to rule the country even after he has recovered from this month's heart bypass surgery.</p>
<p>Gennady Zyuganov, runner-up to Yeltsin in last July's presidential election, sugegsted the president may not be able to put in the long hours needed to tackle Russia's many problems even when he returns to the Kremlin.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who knows anything about medicine knows that after three heart attacks, five bypasses and with concerns about a number of other organs, a person cannot work at full strength,&quot; Zyuganov told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;They talk now about 'ability to work.' What is this? Some think 30 minutes is enough, others an hour. I think that in crisis situations a person should work for 24 hours, take control of the situation and be able to take urgent decisions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zyuganov said Russia was in chaos and criticised Kremlin chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais for amassing power since Yeltsin fell ill just before his re-election on July 3.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, appeared on television for the first time on Wednesday, 15 days after his quintuple bypass operation on November 5.</p>
<p>Yeltsin walked slowly through the grounds of the Central Clinical Hospital where he has been recovering but spoke clearly. He made it clear he was keen to return to work.</p>
<p>Doctors have said the workaholic president may be back in the Kremlin around New Year and have suggested he should have no problems working about eight or 10 hours a day.</p>
