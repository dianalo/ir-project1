<title>CHINA: China general in sexual harassment scandal.</title>
<headline>China general in sexual harassment scandal.</headline>

<p>China's military authorities have blocked the promotion of a general after he was accused of sexual harassment by a woman soldier, Chinese sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>General Qu Cong has been transferred back to the Guangzhou Military Zone in the southern province of Guangdong after the soldier, a member of the Uighur minority in restive northwestern Xinjiang, accused him of sexual harassment during a trip to North Korea, the sources said.</p>
<p>Qu and the soldier, whose identity was withheld in the rare expose of sexual harassment in China, were members of a Chinese military delegation that visited North Korea recently, said the sources who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Qu had initially been designated for promotion to chancellor of the Liberation Army Art Academy, the sources said.</p>
<p>His promotion was blocked after Jiang Zemin, chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission and general secretary of the ruling Communist Party, ordered commission member General Yu Yongbo to look into the scandal and placate Xinjiang.</p>
<p>&quot;Xinjiang was very dissatisfied,&quot; one of the sources said.</p>
<p>The general tried to force the soldier to have sex with him, but she resisted, the sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;If (the victim) were not Uighur and were Han Chinese, nothing would have happened,&quot; a second source said.</p>
<p>Uighurs are a Moslem Turkic people indigenous to Xinjiang, a region that borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three former Soviet central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. They speak a language closely related to Uzbek.</p>
<p>While China has no qualms about crushing a separatist movement in Xinjiang, it says it has poured billions of dollars to develop the region and that Uighurs are a privileged class, enjoying preferential treatment in school and employment.</p>
<p>Xinjiang has a long history of ethnic unrest and has been hit by sporadic pro-independence bombings and assassination attempts in recent months.</p>
<p>During a recent trip to Xinjiang, General Zhang Zhen, a vice-chairman of the commission, said soldiers should &quot;serve as models for the unity of various nationalities&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If the unity...of various nationalities is firm like a rock, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome and any plot aimed at destroying the stability and development of Xinjiang is doomed to failure,&quot; Zhang was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Peng was in the restive region this month to break ground for the construction of a railway, which he said would boost the confidence in the Communist Party among ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The railway would help to narrow the gap between the wealthy eastern and impoverished western parts of China, Li said at the ground-breaking ceremony in Korla city.</p>
<p>In May, China ordered tighter border controls in the region to prevent the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from neighbouring Moslem states. It also ordered a crackdown on campuses in the sprawling region.</p>
<p>In the same month, separatists wanted for an attack on a Moslem leader and a government adviser were shot dead in a gunbattle.</p>
