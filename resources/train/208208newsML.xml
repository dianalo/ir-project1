<title>MALAYSIA: KL blue chips end at high, secondaries slump.</title>
<headline>KL blue chips end at high, secondaries slump.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-11-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Renewed foreign and local fund interest and a technical breakthrough at a crucial level drove Kuala Lumpur blue chips to a closing high on Thursday after initial weakness.</p>
<p>But small-capitalisation shares failed to pick up steam, with the Second Board index posting a 2.51 percent loss.</p>
<p>&quot;When the Composite Index breached 1200, that boosted sentiment very positively,&quot; said Ami Moris, a vice president in dealing at Capitalcorp. &quot;Fund managers are coming up to buy across the board (in blue chips).&quot; The Composite Index ended up 3.63 to 1205.72, surpassing the 1202.09 close on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>After a similarly downcast beginning, the Second Board index ended off 16.04 points to 622.89.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were unconcerned about the decline among the smaller stocks, noting the sector is usually resilient. &quot;It (the drop) is due,&quot; said an institutional dealer at a local broker. &quot;One should only get worried if it takes it on the chin for the second or third day,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Turnover totalled more than 289 million shares, with the main board contributing the lion's share at 218 million. Losers outpaced gainers by 353 to 251.  </p>
<p>Infrastructure stocks attracted interest, with Renong up 18 cents to 4.48 ringgit, Pembinaan YCS ahead 90 cents to 13.20 and United Engineers up 20 cents to 21.70 ringgit.</p>
<p>Shares of Malaysian Resources rose 30 cents to 10 ringgit, requoting after it announced it has agreed to buy 19.05 percent of stockbroker Rashid Hussain for over 1 billion ringgit.</p>
<p>On the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange, spot November contract closed up 4.3 points to 1,208.3 on volume of 223 lots, while the December contract was up 3.3 to 1,216.3 on volume of 70 lots.</p>
