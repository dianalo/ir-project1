<title>USA: Orange County assistant treasurer found guilty.</title>
<headline>Orange County assistant treasurer found guilty.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA ANA, Calif. 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>A jury on Friday found former Orange County, Calif., assistant treasurer Matthew Raabe guilty of felony charges stemming from the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The jury of six men and six women convicted Raabe, a central figure in the county's bankruptcy crisis, on all five counts, including the misappropriation of public funds and lying to investors.</p>
<p>Raabe, 41, showed little emotion while the verdict was read out. His wife burst into tears.</p>
<p>Raabe was told to post $25,000 bail. If he failed to, he would immediately be taken into custody, court officials said.</p>
<p>Raabe chose not to testify on his own behalf during the five-week trial in state Superior Court in Santa Ana, the Orange County seat. He now faces as many as 13 years in prison and a $10 million fine.</p>
<p>The prosecution said the verdict, announced on the third day of deliberations, was a major victory.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence was extremely strong (that) Raabe was the mastermind of the whole operation,&quot; Orange County Assistant District Attorney Jan Nolan told reporters. &quot;There was just no doubt how the jury was supposed to come back and I'm very, very glad that they came back with this verdict.&quot;</p>
<p>The defense said the verdict was a shock.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a huge disappointment,&quot; defense attorney Gary Pohlson said. &quot;I'm shocked that they found this man guilty, especially in such a short period of time.&quot;</p>
<p>Pohlson added, &quot;The evidence was clear that this was a good man who worked hard for the county.&quot;</p>
<p>Orange County filed for bankruptcy in December 1994 after sustaining losses of more than $1.6 billion on risky investments. The county emerged from bankruptcy last June.</p>
<p>Raabe was indicted by a county grand jury in May 1995.</p>
<p>He faced five felony counts, which included the misappropriation of public funds, making false statements in the sale of securities and failure to transfer public funds.</p>
<p>County prosecutors alleged that Raabe helped divert nearly $90 million in interest earnings owed to cities, schools and special districts that invested in the county-run investment pool before the county descended into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>One juror told reporters after the verdict was read that panel members felt sympathy for Raabe but found the evidence too strong to ignore.</p>
<p>A hearing was set for Monday to set a date for Raabe's sentencing.</p>
<p>Nolan said Friday's verdict marked &quot;the end of a chapter&quot; in the county's bankruptcy saga. Raabe's trial could be the last brought by the county district attorney as part of its investigation of the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Raabe) has now been forced to take responsibility,&quot; Nolan said. &quot;But I don't know if anything can help the county put the bankruptcy behind it.&quot;</p>
<p>Raabe was one of several Orange County officials to face charges after the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In April 1995, former Orange County Treasurer Robert Citron, facing the same charges as Raabe, pleaded guilty. A judge last November ordered him to spend a year in jail and pay a $100,000 fine, but Citron was later assigned to a community work program instead of jail.</p>
<p>Last October, a judge sentenced former Orange County budget director Ronald Rubino to probation for his role in the investment crisis.</p>
<p>A state appeals court last November dismissed charges against two Orange County supervisors accused of misconduct in connection with the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Then in March an appeals court disqualified Orange County's district attorney from prosecuting the county auditor-controller on accusations stemming from the crisis.</p>
