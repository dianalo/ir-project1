<title>BELGIUM: EU agrees to ease way for sex discrimination victims.</title>
<headline>EU agrees to ease way for sex discrimination victims.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>European Union social affairs ministers agreed in principle on Monday to adopt rules designed to make it easier for workers to win sex discrimination cases against their employers.</p>
<p>They also adopted legislation to bring EU law into line with a landmark court decision requiring companies to give men and women equal treatment in occupational pension schemes.</p>
<p>But they rejected a third proposal to clarify EU rules on job preference schemes for women in the wake of another court ruling that declared a German quota scheme illegal.</p>
<p>Most ministers thought that legislation was either unnecessary or premature, EU officials said.</p>
<p>The first measure, which cannot be formally adopted until the European Parliament has given its opinion, would make plaintiffs and defendants share the burden of proof in sex discrimination suits.</p>
<p>It would not apply in Britain, which won an opt-out in the Maastricht Treaty to some EU workplace regulations.</p>
<p>It would require plaintiffs to present facts in court from which &quot;direct or indirect&quot; sex discrimination could be &quot;presumed&quot;. The employer would then have to to prove that it had not violated equal opportunity principles.</p>
<p>In separate action, the ministers agreed to amend a 1986 equal pay law to bring pension provisions on retirement age and survivors' benefits within its scope.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice ruled in the &quot;Barber&quot; case that sex discrimination in company pension plans violated EU treaty provisions requiring equal pay for men and women.</p>
<p>Most ministers said they were not ready, however, to adopt another measure aimed at ensuring that employers do not interpret a Court of Justice ruling on job quotas too broadly.</p>
<p>The court in its &quot;Kalanke&quot; ruling said that a quota system enacted by the German state of Bremen violated the EU law by giving women with the same qualifications as men &quot;absolute and unconditional&quot; priority for jobs in categories where they were under-represented.</p>
<p>The European Commission proposed legislation to assure employers that they could adopt schemes to boost the number of women -- or men in some cases -- who were hired or promoted as long as they were not rigid quotas.</p>
<p>But most ministers said either the text was unnecessary because the ruling stood by itself or premature because the Court of Justice is expected to issue another key ruling on job-preference schemes and the inter-governmental conference on EU treaty reforms is discussing equal opportunities issues. -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800</p>
