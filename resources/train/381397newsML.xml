<p>Hundreds of riot police broke up clashes between rightists and left-wingers at a Berlin railway station and also deployed in strength in a village in eastern Germany to reinforce a ban on a skinhead concert, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>About 600 officers were called in to the Berlin suburban station on Saturday after about 30 rightists planning to hold a protest meeting &quot;to keep jobs for the Germans&quot; were cornered by hundreds of leftwingers.</p>
<p>One police officer was seriously injured and 13 others were slightly hurt. Police detained about 100 people, keeping three of them in custody under suspicion of serious breach of the peace and releasing the rest.</p>
<p>Police said left-wing groups, including members of the federation of Jewish students, the German DGB trade union federation, the reform communist PDS party and Turkish groups had organised a counter-demonstration against the meeting.</p>
<p>Chanting &quot;Nazis out&quot; some of the leftwingers threw stones at the rightists and skinheads, who held flags with the colours of the old German empire and hid inside a train standing at the station until the police arrived.</p>
<p>Some youths with blood running down their faces were given first-aid treatment on the spot.</p>
<p>About 400 police officers were sent into the village of Niederseitersdorf, near the Polish border, late on Saturday after about 250 skinheads went on a rampage, vandalising property, and gathered in a bar shouting right-wing slogans.</p>
<p>Police had banned them from holding a planned pop concert in a nearby village. About 42 of them were detained, but later released and police swept the area, checking hundreds of cars and individuals to enforce the ban on the gathering.</p>
<p>The Saxony state authorities said such concerts are often used by skinheads and other right-wing youths as a vehicle for their extremist propaganda.</p>
