<p>Argentine brewery Quilmes Industrial SA has been disappointed with the Chilean beer market since buying a controlling stake in Cerveceria Chile in 1995, Quilmes' commercial director Ricardo Oxenford was quoted as saying Monday.</p>
<p>Citing competition with native-made pisco, Oxenford said the overall market had not expanded in line with expectations but longer-term prospects may improve.  </p>
<p>The company's Chilean brands Becker and Baltica were doing well but imported Argentine brand Quilmes had posted disappointing sales in Chile, he said in the business daily Estrategia.</p>
<p>&quot;We are disappointed and concerned over the beer market's performance because in the last four years, it has not grown. On the contrary, it has shrunk on a per capita basis from a bit over 28 liters to a bit over 27 liters, in a period in which the Chilean economy grew 30 percent,&quot; Oxenford was quoted as saying.  </p>
<p>Beer sales by volume fell five percent in the first quarter of this year, he said, but he said &quot;we think in the long term the market will grow.&quot;  The company's main competitor in Chile is Cervecerias Unidas.</p>
<p>Oxenford said a future option for the company may be to produce beer in Chile for the Argentine market.  This option would become more attractive as the Mercosur trading agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay lowered trade barriers, he said.  Chile is an associate member of Mercosur.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently companies should be seen as part of a regional market, more than a single country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pisco, a grappa-like brandy, has complicated growth in the beer market, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Chile has an alcoholic beverage that does not exist in Argentina, pisco.  Since it's widely used here, it's become a product that competes strongly among alcoholic beverages,&quot; he said.</p>
