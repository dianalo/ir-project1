<p>A U.S. adventurer fell short on Monday of his dream to become the first person to fly nonstop around the world in a balloon but broke a 16-year-old endurance record before landing safely in northern India.</p>
<p>Exhausted but satisfied, Steve Fossett told Reuters he touched down at 1:05 p.m. (0735 GMT) about 150 km (95 miles) northwest of Varanasi in remote Nonkhar town, about halfway around the world from his U.S. starting point.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very good trip,&quot; Fossett told Reuters in New Delhi by telephone from Peeparpur village, some 550 km (330 miles) southeast of the Indian capital.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could have made the biggest achievement and flown around the world. But this is also successful.&quot;</p>
<p>Fossett was forced to abandon his quest for one of manned flight's oldest goals after his shimmering &quot;Solo Spirit&quot; ran short of fuel.</p>
<p>The commodity broker-turned-adventurer had to take a detour around Libya when Tripoli denied him the right to fly over the North African country on Friday.</p>
<p>Libya later granted permission but not before Fossett had headed south, burning extra fuel.</p>
<p>Fossett began his flight late last Monday night in St Louis, Missouri.</p>
<p>Shortly before landing, he broke the endurance record of six days, 16 minutes for a manned balloon flight, set in 1981 by Americans Ben Abruzzo and Troy Bradley. Fossett said he averaged two hours of sleep a day during his trip.</p>
<p>On Friday, Fossett broke his own record for balloon distance travel when he passed 8,747 km (5,435 miles) over Algeria. He set the earlier mark on a flight from South Korea to Canada.</p>
<p>Fossett said he had enough fuel to make it eastwards halfway across the Pacific if he had continued, but that the winds might have carried him northward towards the Himalaya mountains and China.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to land in a valley near the Ganges River,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't want to continue on over the Himalayas and didn't want to land in China because I did not have permission to land there.&quot;</p>
<p>Fossett's project manager, Bo Kemper, said he believed the adventurer would make another bid for the around-the-world record next year.</p>
<p>For much of Monday morning, Fossett circled over Varanasi, one of the Hindu religion's holiest cities, known for its bathing &quot;ghats&quot;, or steps, that descend into the Ganges River.</p>
<p>He finally set down in Nonkhar, a small town between Varanasi and Lucknow cities in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Fossett battled fatigue, cold and thunderstorms in the final stages of his journey.</p>
<p>His 150-ft (45-metre) double-skinned balloon travelled more than 10,000 miles (16,000 km), riding swift winter jet streams in the Northern Hemisphere before he brought it down.</p>
<p>He said he landed safely in a field and was not injured, but his balloon ripped when it snagged in a tree. &quot;It was a safe but rough landing,&quot; he said, adding that the wind was blowing at 24 km (15 miles) an hour. &quot;It probably ruined the balloon.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if he was disappointed he did not achieve his goal of circling the globe, Fossett said: &quot;Not really. This was also successful. It showed we are very close to being able to fly around the world.&quot;</p>
