<title>COLOMBIA: Colombia's net foreign reserves hit historic high.</title>
<headline>Colombia's net foreign reserves hit historic high.</headline>
<dateline>BOGOTA 1997-01-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Colombia's net foreign reserves stood at $8.94 billion as of Dec. 20, the most recent date for which official figures are available, the central bank said in a report Wednesday.</p>
<p>The reserve figure is thought to be an all-time high, although the central bank declined to confirm this.  </p>
<p>In the entire January to November period, Colombia's net reserves grew by just $55 million and stood at $8.38 billion.</p>
<p>The net reserves in the period to Dec. 20 were swelled by more than $560 million through central bank intervention in the currency markets.</p>
<p>It saw itself forced to step in and prop up the dollar as large amounts of greenbacks flowed into Colombia from traditional export sectors and especially in the wake of the government's power plant privatization program in December.</p>
<p>Private analysts estimate net reserves stood close to $10 billion by year-end but the central bank has not yet released official figures and has declined to comment on the claims.</p>
<p>The peso sank to 1,025 pesos to the dollar Friday after losing 15.55 pesos in a day as public sector companies snapped up dollars to service foreign debt and banks moved to cover forward dollar positions.  But in Tuesday's session the peso rallied to close at 1,022.9.</p>
