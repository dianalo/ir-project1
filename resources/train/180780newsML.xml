<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>
<headline>Italian bonds/futures closing report.</headline>

<p>Italian debt markets ended softer after a subdued day which traders described as &quot;boring, boring, boring,&quot; with U.S. markets closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>The dollar's break down through 1.50 marks and domestic politics in Rome caused a few flutters when the centre-right Freedom opposition and the separatist Northern League both said they would not participate in the lower house voting on the 1997 budget legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a small panic among the uninitiated about quorums but after a quick bit of arithmetic people realised it doesn't threaten the budget's passage,&quot; one broker in London said.  </p>
<p>The centre-left government, hard-left Communist Refoundation and a mixed group which votes with the government have enough seats to ensure the lower house is quorate and the bill goes through even with out the opposition Freedom Alliance.</p>
<p>People note ground level discontent coming through after protests over tax reforms at the weekend and with positive news like a lira return to the ERM and lower interest rates priced in near term, traders say investors are keeping half an eye on the prospects for next year already.</p>
<p>The December futures contract on LIFFE was three basis points down at 125.68 in late trade.  </p>
<p>The July 2006 Btp was one basis point down at 107.10 with the yield at 7.83 percent, with trading hampered by technical problems on the market. The spread over the benchmark 10-year Bund was 195 basis points, slightly wider than around 191 earlier today.</p>
<p>Traders said the absence of U.S. markets meant trade may have been distorted and it was necessary to see the real direction markets would take once U.S. dealers returned tomorrow.</p>
