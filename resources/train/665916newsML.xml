<p>The transfer of Sparta Prague midfielder Martin Frydek to Germany's Bayern Leverkusen, which appeared to be signed last week, has fallen under a cloud of confusion after Sparta officials denied the move had been finalised.</p>
<p>Last week, the two teams appeared to reach an agreement on the transfer, reported to be worth some 1.2 million marks.</p>
<p>But Czech international Frydek said on Tuesday that the chances of his moving to the German club have dimmed greatly after Sparta's Slovak-led management team said two signatures of board members were needed in order to approve the transfer.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very upset, I don't know what conditions complicated the situation, maybe financial ones. Right now, I see my chances at leaving for Leverkusen at about 50-50,&quot; Frydek was quoted as saying in the daily Sport.</p>
<p>Frydek's agent Zdenek Nehoda said he was shown a signed contract between Bayern Leverkusen and Sparta, signed by its General Manager Gejza Sestak and his German counterpart.</p>
<p>Sparta President Milan Valasik, however, told Sport that under conditions set out within the club, two board members must sign agreements concerning player transfers.</p>
<p>&quot;Sestak of course has the right to sign, but his signature alone is not enough,&quot; Valasik said.</p>
<p>&quot;My personal opinion is that the amount Leverkusen is offering is inadequate,&quot; he added though he would not comment on the amount Sparta was offered, or seeking for Frydek.</p>
<p>Sparta, which won its 23rd first division title this year, was bought by Slovak steel group VSZ last year, which promptly changed the club's leadership.</p>
<p>Frydek was a frequent subsitute for the upstart Czechs during the Euro 96 campaign, which saw the team reach the final before losing to Germany on a &quot;golden goal&quot; in sudden-death extra-time.</p>
