<p>The Oslo bourse climbed to new historic highs on Thursday, as investors continued to plough money into the market after overnight gains on Wall Street, dealers said. A flush of good annual results and company presentations were also adding to the upward momentum.</p>
<p>The Total index closed 0.85 percent off at 1,084.59 points, having hit an intraday high at 1,087.86 points. Turnover was a robust 1.36 billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;We followed up from yesterday's gains in the U.S. but even so we're still lagging. We're always a little more careful in Norway,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>&quot;But some of this is liquidity driven. People are putting their money into funds, which are growing at an enormous rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Banking and industry sectors led the rise, the banking index closing almost four percent up at 111.54 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Banking is extremely hot at the moment, which is basically based on low interest rates and results,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Offshore services group Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS) was the star stock of the day, gaining six crowns, or 2.43 percent, to 275 crowns in 90 million crowns of trade. Traders said the gain was based on the company's presentation on Thursday following the release of record results for 1996.</p>
