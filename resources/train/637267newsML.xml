<p>Austria on Wednesday mourned the deaths of two U.N. soldiers shot on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights last week.</p>
<p>The bodies of the two, who were serving with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Forces (UNDOF) stationed in the buffer zone between Syria and Israel, were flown in from Damascus and were received with full military honours in a ceremony at Vienna airport.</p>
<p>An investigation into the deaths of Warrant Officer Wolfgang Grasser, 40, and Master Corporal Gerhard Karitschnig, 26, is underway but has so far failed to yield any clues to who was behind the killings.</p>
<p>&quot;Austria will not forget the life and death of these two Austrians,&quot; Defence Minister Werner Fasslabend said in a speech at the ceremony.</p>
<p>Around 100 soldiers of the men's platoon formed a guard of honour and grieving family members hugged each other as the flag-draped coffins were carried from the aircraft.</p>
<p>The two will be buried with full military honours in the next two days.</p>
<p>In Damascus, a U.N. official said the Austrians were shot while on foot patrol on the Syrian side of the Golan. They were found last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation is still going on and we will issue a press release as soon as we reach any firm results,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>U.N. sources have expressed surprise at the incident, which was rare in the history of UNDOF since it deployed in the area in 1974 following the 1973 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Austria has more than 400 soldiers in the 1,050-strong force, which serves as a buffer between Syrian and Israeli forces.</p>
