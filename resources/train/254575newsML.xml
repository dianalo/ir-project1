<p>Ukraine will have to take more steps to improve its economy if it hopes to receive two European Union credits totalling 350 million ECU ($437 million) for this year and 1997, an EU director said on Friday.</p>
<p>Ukraine is awaiting delivery of a 100 million ECU ($125 million) tranche from a 200 million ECU ($250 million) loan agreed earlier this year, and has requested a 250 million ECU ($312 million) loan for 1997, Joly Dixon, a European Commission economic director, said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are measures to be taken before the second tranche can be disbursed,&quot; Dixon said at a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to Kiev.</p>
<p>He said outstanding points to be settled for the tranche included implementation of simpler import certification procedures and removal of discriminatory excise laws, as well as better public procurement practices.</p>
<p>The EU also wanted to see increased foreign direct investment -- Ukraine has only attracted $1.2 billion in investment since independence in 1991 -- and creation of a more competitive privatisation process.</p>
<p>Dixon said he expected the issues to be resolved soon and that the money could be delivered &quot;very early next year.&quot;</p>
<p>The EU has given Ukraine $4 billion in grants and balance of payments loans since it won independence in 1991, including a $675 million technical aid deal signed in September.</p>
<p>The EU director said Ukraine's receipt of the 1997 loan depended on sustained economic progress, approval from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $2.5 to $3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and passage of the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The economic programme which forms the basis of government reforms, and the basis of agreement of negotiations with the IMF for the Extended Fund Facility, depends on the adoption of a very radical budget and very far-reaching reforms,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The budget draft, agreed with the IMF, forecasts a budget deficit at 5.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) -- four percent by Western calculations -- and foresees inflation at 25 percent, down from an expected 40 percent this year.</p>
<p>But the left-dominated parliament is expected to give the budget a rough ride and may demand significant changes.</p>
<p>By law it is to be approved by January 1 but officials have predicted it may be delayed by as much as several months.</p>
<p>An IMF board is expected to decide this month or next whether Ukraine, which eventually hopes to become a member of the European Union, will receive the EFF, which would succeed the $867 million stand-by programme agreed in May.</p>
