<title>CHINA: Families surrender illegal migrant children in HK.</title>

<p>Hundreds of families flocked to Hong Kong's immigration headquarters on Friday to surrender illegal immigrant children who had sneaked in from China, Hong Kong radio said.</p>
<p>The rush was sparked by a pronouncement on Thursday that child illegals could remain here while their parental background was checked to determine if they had a right to stay.</p>
<p>Families who have been hiding children smuggled in from China clearly interpreted the pronouncement as a virtual amnesty and &quot;touch base&quot; policy.</p>
<p>Crowds of families arrived at Hong Kong's immigration department on Friday morning to surrender their mainland-born children to the authorities, the radio said.</p>
<p>On Thursday the authorities said child illegals would not be repatriated immediately if they could prove they have residency rights under Hong Kong's new constitution, the Basic Law.</p>
<p>The Immigration Department set up a special office in its main lobby to cope with the avalanche of cases.</p>
<p>The Basic Law, which took effect on Tuesday when the former British colony became a quasi autonomous Chinese territory, says mainland-born offspring of a Hong Kong permanent resident are entitled to stay here.</p>
<p>Not all of them need be youngsters. &quot;Under the Basic Law, they will be entitled to have the right of abode, irrespective of whether they are over or under 18 years of age,&quot; said principal immigration officer Lan Ping-kwun.</p>
<p>As a result, adult illegals and overstayers also arrived to give themselves up, in the belief that they too might qualify for residency status under some kind of general amnesty.</p>
<p>But the immigration authorities were taking a firm line on some of these people. Lan said 10 illegal immigrants who turned themselves in would be deported and 30 overstayers prosecuted.</p>
<p>More than 400 illegal immigrant children from China and their families flooded Hong Kong's immigration department on Thursday to press for residency rights following the territory's return to China.</p>
<p>The children, whose parents are Hong Kong residents, were among hundreds of minors who came into the territory earlier this year in the hope of claiming a post-handover right of abode.</p>
<p>The immigration department promised not to deport the illegal minors before their identity can be confirmed, sparking Friday's rush.</p>
<p>It is estimated that 60,000 children from &quot;separated families&quot; are waiting to settle in the territory. But only 150 mainland people, including 66 children, are allowed to migrate into Hong Kong daily, so many try to sneak in illegally to avoid a long wait.</p>
