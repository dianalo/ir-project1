<p>China is to spend heavily to import foreign technology in its battle to curb pollution and limit damage to the environment caused by breakneck economic growth, the China Daily said on Friday.</p>
<p>Between 220 billion yuan ($26.5 billion) and 320 billion yuan would be spent on upgrading environmental protection equipment over the five years to 2000, the newspaper quoted trade officials as saying.</p>
<p>Economic growth in China has boomed in recent years as the country abandons Stalinist central planning and moves toward a sink-or-swim market system, but development has been shadowed by air pollution, acid rain and the poisoning of land and rivers.</p>
<p>The China Daily gave no details of how Beijing would channel its investment in environmental protection, but said an international exhibition in Beijing in November was expected to feature technologies from about 80 overseas firms. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
