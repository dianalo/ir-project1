<headline>Failed Estonia vote seen as warning to president.</headline>

<p>Estonia's parliament on Tuesday delivered a slap in the face for incumbent president Lennart Meri when it refused three times to back him in his bid for a second term as head of state for the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>Although the favoured candidate in the two man field, Meri failed three times in two days to secure the required 68 votes from the small Baltic state's 101-member parliament - despite a last minute promise to change his style.</p>
<p>The presidential election will now go before a larger, specially formed assembly in the next month or so with Meri and rival candidate Arnold Ruutel automatically qualifying but the field also open to new nominations.</p>
<p>Parliamentary support for the charismatic Meri, 67, has waned in recent years, with many MPs accusing him of overstepping his non-executive role since winning the presidency a year after independence in 1991, taking too much power and acting without consulting parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;He has only appeared in parliament four times in the past four years. This is king-like behaviour,&quot; one of parliament's deputy speakers Tunne Kelam told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This election was a warning sign to him.&quot;</p>
<p>Meri particularly angered MPs in 1994 when he signed an agreement in Moscow for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Estonia, which left some former Soviet military personnel in the country, without consulting parliament.</p>
<p>Meri's drop in popularity was evident in the voting as he only scored 45 votes in the first round on Monday, 49 in the second round on Tuesday morning and finally 52 late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ruutel, 68, parliament's other deputy speaker and a politician in the Soviet era liked for his nationalist tendencies, secured 34 votes in the first two ballots then 32 in the third.</p>
<p>Kelam said he himself considered standing in the second ballot, representing his parliamentary party, the Fatherlands Union, but he was dissuaded by Meri at a breakfast meeting on Tuesday when the president promised to change his ways.</p>
<p>&quot;Meri agreed to change his style and cooperate with the adoption of a special law to regulate the president's behaviour so we agreed to support him,&quot; said Kelam.</p>
<p>&quot;He's been fantastic in conducting foreign policy and we could not have had a better president for the times but things have now changed and people fear if he is re-elected noone will be able to stop him for the next five years.&quot;</p>
<p>The presidential election will now go before an electoral college made up of the 101 MPs and 273 local government representatives with the timeframe to be decided at a meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Politicians were hesitant in forecasting the results of the next round in the presidential election, expecting new candidates in the field but Meri, a former writer and documentary film maker, to remain the favourite.</p>
<p>&quot;The message has been given that a certain number of MPs consider Lennart Meri to be the most suitable choice for president, with the vote getting more positive, and this is likely to be reflected in the electoral college,&quot; MP Mihkel Earnoja told Reuters.</p>
<p>If the electoral college fails in two rounds of voting to give a candidate a clear majority, the election will go back into the parliament and start again from stage one.</p>
