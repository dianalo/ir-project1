<p>U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a news conference in Tokyo on Tuesday that he was not worried about Japan's bad loan problem.  </p>
<p>&quot;I must say to you I would be terribly concerned about resolution of these difficult problems if I came here and found that the Japanese banks, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan are not fully aware of what's going on,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Greenspan was referring to problems in Japan's financial system and non-performing loans held by Japanese financial institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there are reasonable expectations of concerns now that the issue has been joined,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Greenspan said reforms of Japan's financial system would bring about increased competition in Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect we are going to be looking forward to a major (and) increasingly important integration of the international financial system.&quot;  </p>
<p>Greenspan said that Japan's initiatives to reform its financial institutions and revise the Bank of Japan law to increase the central bank's independence are &quot;very specific and concrete and in my judgement a potentially effective means in dealing with those problems&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the prime minister and the finance minister's initiative struck me as a very hopeful sign for the future.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan said he was &quot;somewhat suprised&quot; at Japan's high degree of commitment to implementing its &quot;Big Bang&quot; financial reform.</p>
<p>&quot;I must say I was somewhat surprised...I found a much higher degree of commitment to implement these (reforms) than I had expected.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect that they will succeed.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said there was no alternative to Tokyo as a key third financial market. &quot;The only question is how successful it will be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It obviously matters to the United States...and to the rest of the world...because international finance is not a zero sum gain, there is a synergetic interaction which creates benefits to all of us,&quot; he told the news conference.  </p>
<p>Greenspan also said that he was sceptical about the concept of currency ranges.</p>
<p>&quot;Until I see some evidence...that such types of ranges really do work, I would be sceptical,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Referring to opinions about currency ranges held by financial analysts such as Fred Bergsten, he added:</p>
<p>&quot;I'm less inclined to believe you can implement these kinds of ranges.</p>
<p>&quot;The type of system we have probably is about as good as we are going to get for the time being.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan said he felt the &quot;Big Bang&quot; financial reform plan announced by Japan last week would contribute to the wider use of the yen as an international currency.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see how it can fail,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;one of the basic problems in not investing in yen-based securities is the underlying structure&quot;.</p>
