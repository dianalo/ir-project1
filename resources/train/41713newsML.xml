<title>UK: Dixons climbs on appliance sales report.</title>

<p>Shares in electrical goods retailer Dixons Group Plc climbed to record highs on Monday buoyed by a report in the Financial Times that sales of household white goods are set to soar, analysts said.</p>
<p>Dixons shares stood 12.5p up at 561.5 by 1350 GMT, after reaching a high of 563p earlier in the trading session.</p>
<p>Kingfisher Plc -- which owns the Comet chain -- also rose, to be up 5p at 687-1/2, a high for the year.  </p>
<p>&quot;Continued buoyant sentiment from the AGM last week and a piece in the FT on white goods growth have helped put a spring in the shares' step,&quot; said Robert Snaith, retail analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.</p>
<p>The FT report said Britain was poised for its highest growth in sales of white goods -- such as fridges and washing machines -- since the late 1980s, according to Electrolux and GEC's Hotpoint, the two biggest suppliers of household appliances.</p>
<p>Signs that the economy is improving and house sales are picking up are prompting people to replace appliances bought in the last decade, the report said.  </p>
<p>The seasonal nature of Dixons' business, with higher sales traditionally in the second half of the year, also contributed to optimism on the stock, analysts added, along with general confidence in the retail sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in an old-fashioned pre-election consumer boom at the moment,&quot; said Snaith.</p>
<p>&quot;But the dilemma you're faced as an investor is that the tills are rattling, so the share price is going up, but nine months down the road interest rates are likely to rise and the share price will be exposed.&quot;</p>
