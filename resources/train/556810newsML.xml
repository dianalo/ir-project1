<p>Gilt futures have so far taken Labour's sweep to power in their stride but further gains will be limited in the coming months ahead of several layers of resistance on the topside, chartists said on Friday.</p>
<p>The key factor is the timing of a rise in interest rates following the election of a Labour government in Britain on Thursday, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically it is a question of when interest rates go up rather than if they go up and we are now looking for evidence that the corrective strength we have seen is going to fail,&quot; said David Sneddon, technical analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London.</p>
<p>June gilt futures were quoted at 110-30, up 5/32 on the day.</p>
<p>Sneddon said gilts were in the process of forming a medium term top. With a potential head and shoulders pattern developing on weekly charts.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are seeing at the moment is, the formation of the right-hand shoulder. The strength we have seen over the past few weeks is a necessary requirement for that large top pattern,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There was good short term resistance at 110-28, 111-00 which had held the market so far, Sneddon said but through there further strength could take gilts up to the 111-28, 112-00 area.</p>
<p>Susan Rigg, technical analyst at Chart Analysis in London, said the contract had the potential to reach as high as 113-16, close to the June contract high at 113-19.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously the market will take time to digest the Labour landslide and see what happens in the budget,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>A mini budget is expected within the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a chance the market will move a little bit higher...the peak that we have seen up at 113-16 is probably going to be the top,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Brenda Sullivan and Elizabeth Miller, technical analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London said there was upside resistance at 112-10.</p>
<p>&quot;From a broader perspective, a surprise extension higher could target 114-05, or even, over the next two to three months, as far as 115-26,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>This level was still within the overall corrective phase on monthly charts going back to the move lower from 121-06 at the end of 1993, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the current indicators and price patterns suggest the market is in long-term declines,&quot; Sullivan and Miller said. &quot;The structural support lies near 108-25 and 108-05; a break of the latter signals acceleration to test the key 107-24 area.&quot;</p>
<p>Sneddon agreed the market would start to fail and would retest pivotal support at 108-05, 108-00. Weekly charts show a low from early January at 108-00.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment we are looking for it to break below that in the medium term. If it does come through, and if it comes through sooner rather than later, that would complete a top pattern for gilts and then you are looking at very sharp falls,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The initial target for these falls would be 106-18 but Sneddon saw the market stretching down to the lows for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;What you are really looking at is a major test of the 104-16, 103-26 support and likely lower,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Rigg said gilts had found support at levels formed in December and January and had a good base at current levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very well supported below the current levels and we are likely to see a ranging phase with an upward bias, but there will not be a huge amount on upside,&quot; she said.</p>
