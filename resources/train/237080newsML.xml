<p>Strong clothing sales with fewer promotions gave holiday cheer to some of the nation's largest store chains in November, retailers said Thursday, but consumer electronics lagged.</p>
<p>Calendar quirks made some year-to-year comparisons look negative because Thanksgiving was later this year, but analysts said that on a week-by-week basis, sales were strong.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody had been downplaying their expectations for November because of this calendar shift, and I actually think the numbers look pretty good,&quot; said Karen Sack, a retail analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers said an improving retail environment for apparel, coupled with easier comparisons, led to gains in November sales. Its same-store sales index for the month rose 3.9 percent, compared with 2.9 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Concurrently, we believe that lower levels of discounting and strong inventory and expense controls have positioned the major retailers well in terms of profitability,&quot; Salomon analysts said in a report.</p>
<p>With holiday shopping off to a brisk start and inventories relatively lean, many retailers were able to put off launching profit-cutting sales and promotions, analysts said. Retailers typically earn a quarter or more of their year's profit during the holiday season.</p>
<p>&quot;Inventories are in good shape ... we're looking for reduced clearance markdown activity in January, so that bodes well for profits,&quot; said Piper Jaffrey analyst Saul Yaari.</p>
<p>Even though many retailers offered fewer promotions, shoppers were still looking for bargains.</p>
<p>&quot;Warehouse membership clubs were probably the stars overall for the month,&quot; Yaari said. &quot;In terms of gift assortments, they improved, and they also have a lot more apparel than they used to.&quot;</p>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said its November same-store sales rose 4 percent, including a 9 percent rise in sales at its Sam's Club warehouse stores.</p>
<p>Kmart Corp.'s U.S. same stores climbed 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck and Co., meanwhile, said it rang up record sales over the Thanksgiving weekend. Although sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.7 percent for the four weeks ended Nov. 30, Sears said the month went according to plan.</p>
<p>&quot;Record sales over Thanksgiving weekend produced an encouraging jump-start for a strong holiday shopping season at Sears,&quot; Sears Chairman Arthur Martinez said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Thanksgiving holiday fell on Nov. 28 this year, while last year it was Nov. 23.</p>
<p>But without a blockbuster product like last year's Windows 95 software, consumer electronics are lagging.</p>
<p>&quot;Industry sales trends remained weak and promotional activity intensified,&quot; said Richard Sharp, Chairman of Circuit City Stores Inc., the largest retailer of brand-name consumer electronics and a leading retailer of personal computers.</p>
<p>&quot;Promotions in consumer electronics were atrocious, I mean really terrible (for retailers' profits),&quot; Yaari said, citing computer monitor and television giveaways with other purchases.</p>
<p>November same-store sales at both Best Buy Co. and Circuit City were down a sharp 8 percent, while Tandy Corp.'s sales fell 2 percent. During the same period last year, Best Buy's comparable store sales rose 15 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's going to end up being one of the best years in the last four for apparel, and for consumer electronics one of the worst,&quot; said Dean Ramos, a retail analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc.</p>
<p>The Dain Bosworth November same-store sales index rose 3.7 percent, compared with 3.1 percent last year.</p>
<p>J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its same-store sales gained 2.5 percent last month. Dayton Hudson Corp. said its November same-store sales rose 1.3 percent, including a 7 percent rise in its Target discount stores. Its department stores had a 10.5 percent slide and its Mervyn's unit saw a 9 percent drop.</p>
<p>One notable exception was Gymboree Corp., which reported that November same-store sales slumped 15 percent. Its stock skidded $4.875, or nearly 18 percent, to $22.875 in early afternoon trading on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>For retailers overall, business is going well, said Richard Jaffe of Schroder Wertheim. &quot;It look's like it'll be a strong holiday. Day-to-day business is good, with much less promotional and more regular pricing.&quot;</p>
