<title>RUSSIA: Russia shares firm on Chubais appointment, seen up.</title>
<headline>Russia shares firm on Chubais appointment, seen up.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Leading Russian shares firmed on Tuesday on the Friday appointment of privatisation guru Anatoly Chubais as First Deputy Prime Minister, traders said.</p>
<p>Dealers forecast steady price growth over the next couple of weeks, despite some uncertainty from announcements that the government, with the exception of Chubais and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, would be reshuffled soon.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 24-share index rose 3.3 percent to 327.37 from 316.89 on a moderate $36.1 million total market volume.</p>
<p>National power grid holder UES  EESR.RTS rose to $0.2255 from $0.2165 on Friday, the previous day of trade.</p>
<p>Oil company Surgutneftegaz  SNGS.RTS firmed to $0.840 from $0.810 and common shares of leading Russian oil producer LUKoil LKOH.RTS rose to $14.38 from $13.84.</p>
<p>Traders said investors were bullish but cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth in the next two weeks will probably not be sharp, but quiet,&quot; said ING Baring head equities dealer Peter Kizenko. &quot;People are being careful after the rally at the beginning of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>UFG trader Maxim Perlin said foreign demand for shares had been steady on Tuesday, the first day of trading after the Friday Chubais announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no buying spree, since the market has become smarter -- investor demand is more appropriate to the situation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But brokers had marked up prices in anticipation of future demand, he added. &quot;Brokers and clients have different opinions of the market...We will see a basic (firming) reaction after the new government is named.&quot;</p>
