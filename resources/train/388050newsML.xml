<p>After sitting through 13 days of testimony, jurors deliberating in the murder trial of John du Pont Wednesday got a chance to ask several questions of their own regarding complex issues of guilt and mental illness.</p>
<p>Du Pont was charged with the January 1996 killing of Olympic champion wrestler David Schultz, the facts of which are not in dispute. Where the defence or prosecution differ is over whether the millionaire was sane enough to know the killing was wrong.</p>
<p>On their second day of deliberations, the jurors asked the judge to repeat instructions regarding the three degrees of homicide with which du Pont has been charged. They also asked for key psychiatric and eyewitness testimony to be reread, and for a second look at chart exhibits.</p>
<p>Delaware County Court of Common Pleas Judge Patricia Jenkins said state trial rules prohibited giving jurors the requested charts dealing with a chronology of events and defence and prosecution theories of key factors in the case.</p>
<p>But she allowed the jury to look at a map of the route du Pont, 58, took to Schultz's house on the day of the killing.</p>
<p>In her instructions before the jury began deliberations Tuesday afternoon, Jenkins had said the jury must first determine whether du Pont shot Schultz, then decide whether he was innocent by reason of insanity -- the verdict du Pont's lawyers have sought after conceding he killed the Olympic champion wrestler.</p>
<p>The jury could also deliver a verdict of not guilty, guilty, or guilty but mentally ill on any of the three charges.</p>
<p>If it decides against an insanity acquittal, the jury would consider the degrees of homicide -- first degree and third degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. Jenkins reiterated criteria for each of the three degrees Wednesday.</p>
<p>The six men and six women on the jury also heard a court official reread testimony of prosecution psychiatrist Park Dietz, who concluded that du Pont was mentally ill but that his killing of Schultz was unrelated to the illness.</p>
<p>Dietz also testified that if du Pont had acted in response to voices that gave him an imminent fear of death, he would be in the class of mentally ill criminals eligible for an insanity defence under Pennsylvania law.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know of any evidence where du Pont was responding to voices anywhere in this case,&quot; Dietz said in the trial testimony.</p>
<p>Also reread was testimony of security consultant Patrick Goodale, who rode in du Pont's car to Schultz's house and saw the killing.</p>
<p>If the jury finds du Pont guilty but mentally ill on any homicide charge, he would face the same penalties as an ordinary guilty verdict,but could receive psychiatric treatment before serving the rest of his sentence.</p>
<p>If he is found not guilty by reason of insanity, a hearing would immediately be held on whether du Pont should be treated in a psychiatric hospital or freed.</p>
