<p>Singapore oil products were stronger on Thursday with gas oil being offered higher, while jet fuel was steady on sustained demand for winter from north Asia, traders said.</p>
<p>They said a local trader who are bringing in MidEast gas oil cargoes are offering at higher levels. A January 9-13 cargo was offered at $32.80 a barrel, fob while a major offered 30,000 tonnes for Jan 9-13 at $33. Offers on Wednesday were seen between $32.40 and $32.70.</p>
<p>Swaps gas oil also rose with January traded at $32.20-$32.24 a barrel, up from previous day's $31.85-$32.00.  </p>
<p>Jet fuel premiums to South Korea rose by 40 cents to be traded at $2.40 a barrel over Singapore spot quotes, c+f for February arrival with premiums to China seen at $2.00. Spurred by the bullish trend, a major started offering a Jan 3-7 lifting jet fuel at $34.00 a barrel before lowering it to $33.55, which was the same level as on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sources said Vietnam's Petrolimex would soon issue a tender to buy various oil products for first quarter 1997 deliveries.</p>
<p>Pakistan has bught a total of 480,000 tonnes 1.0-percent sulphur diesel for January-March deliveries at $1.10-$1.34 a barrel over MidEast quotes c+f, from Glencore and Bakri Trading.  </p>
<p>Naphtha inched up on overnight crude rise. January swaps traded at $24.10, up five cents from Wednesday. S. Korean petrochemical firms said after Wednesday's meeting in Seoul, they were &quot;seriously&quot; considering lowering naphtha cracker operating rates as they were suffering weak margins due to firm naphtha prices. Endusers sought only two cargoes for first half February delivery to Korea and two more for second half. Gasoline also rose. An early January Dalian cargo was heard sold to a western trader at 70 cents over Singapore 93 octane quotes. Traders said the quality was better. A 95-oct cargo was offered at $25.40 for Jan 8-12.--Singapore Newsroom (65-870 3084)</p>
