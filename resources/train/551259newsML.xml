<headline>MG to move metals trade to London, NY; plans purchase.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>Metallgesellschaft Handel &amp; Beteiligungen AG (MG Handel), the trading unit of Germany's Metallgesellschaft AG, said Wednesday it plans to concentrate its physical metal trading operations in London and New York.</p>
<p>The operations, previously incorporated in MG Metal &amp; Commodity GmbH, will now be under the control of MG Metal &amp; Commodity Group.</p>
<p>The move may entail the relocation of some 56 jobs now based in Frankfurt, Germany. The company said discussions have been started to work out a social compensation package for affected workers.</p>
<p>MG also said that as part of the growth of its trading operations MG Metal &amp; Commodity plans to acquire the copper trading business and certain assets of New York-based Cerro Sales Corp. in May.</p>
<p>The parties have agreed not to disclose the price of the transaction, MG Handel said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cerro Sales is a member of the Marmon Group and is active in the international trading and marketing of non-ferrous metals, predominantly copper. It has a regional focus in North and South America.</p>
<p>MG Handel spokesman Gerolf Werning said most of its metals trading business is located outside Germany so the move fits in with company strategy.</p>
<p>Trading in chemical products like sulphur and industrial chemicals will remain in Frankfurt and Paris, he said.</p>
