<title>MEXICO: ING Baring upgrades Mexico, cuts Venezuela.</title>
<headline>ING Baring upgrades Mexico, cuts Venezuela.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-03-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>ING Barings said Friday it has upgraded Mexico to modest overweight from underweight based on &quot;the market's lagging year-to-date dollar performance&quot; and other reasons.</p>
<p>At the same time, ING Barings said it was downgrading Venezuela to neutral from overweight because of lower dollar returns relative to those of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.  </p>
<p>The report, attributed to Tim Love, head of Latin American research, also upgraded Brazil's year-end stock exchange target to 12,100 points from 10,000 points &quot;based on EPS revisions in the cyclical stocks&quot;, higher upsides on key stocks and positive developments on &quot;reform bills and fiscal stability fund approval.&quot;</p>
<p>Brazil's Bovespa stock index was up 26 at 9,152 this morning.  </p>
<p>The target for Peru's year-end stock index also was revised upward to 1,800 points from 1,700 points because &quot;Mr. Love expects that Peru could see GDP recovery of 4.5 percent or more,&quot; adding that &quot;consensus forecasts are rising to match those of ING Barings.&quot;</p>
<p>Peru's General Index was up 12.26 this morning at 1,662.73.</p>
<p>As for Mexico, the report said the upgrade was made in part because of &quot;a perceived short-term peak in the widening of Mexican fixed-income spreads over U.S. Treasuries and a revised Mexican peso forecast.&quot;</p>
<p>ING Barings's year-end Mexican peso forecast has improved to 8.7 per dollar from 9.3 per dollar because of strong liquidity inflows and greater risk tolerance on the part of investors.</p>
<p>Venezuela's downgrade was due to reductions in oil prices and &quot;a knock-on in market sentiment, as well as concerns over recent inflation data and its effect on either the currency or domestic EPS growth.&quot;</p>
