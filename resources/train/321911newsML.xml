<p>The short end of the curve was set to resume its upwards march on Wednesday, traders said, after Senate testimony by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan brought no bad news about the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>At the longer end, the spread with Bunds would remain between 85 and 90 basis points, they said.</p>
<p>But the shorter end had more upside because it had not accompanied Spain in its spurt earlier in the week, allowing the spreads to widen.</p>
<p>&quot;After Greenspan's speech...there is more optimism,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>The spread between the March 1999 OT and the October 1999 Spanish Bono closed at 17 basis points on Tuesday after narrowing below seven basis points in past days.</p>
<p>&quot;There is going to be some strong buying at the short-end,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Traders said that markets in the morning had been concerned about the health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and about what Greenspan might have to say.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan had nothing catastrophic to say about inflation,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>The escudo closed steady at 99.60 to the mark in a session dominated by movements in the mark-peseta. Traders see possible further gains for the Portuguese currency against the mark if the dollar continues to strengthen.</p>
