<p>Consumption of gold in key world markets shot up to a record 771 tonnes in the first three months of this year on the back of strong demand for jewellery in the Middle East and Asia, an authoritative report said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The World Gold Council (WGC), a producer body, said demand in Saudi Arabia, India and Indonesia was at all-time highs.</p>
<p>Prices, however, languished as supply was adequate and markets feared that other central banks would follow a lead by the Netherlands and sell gold from their reserves.</p>
<p>The WGC said gold demand for January-March 1997 in the countries that it monitors, accounting for about 80 percent of the world total, was up 17 percent on the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>Demand in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America rose by 22 percent but in the developed markets the gain was only two percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Jewellery demand was the mainstay of this sparkling performance with a gain of 17 percent to 641 tonnes. In addition the recovery of bar and coin demand after four consecutive quarters of decline also played an important role with bars and coins rising 20 percent to 113 tonnes,&quot; the WGC said.</p>
<p>George Milling-Stanley of the WGC's economic service said there were grounds for optimism that demand could keep up the pace. But despite the strong demand, gold prices fell steadily.</p>
<p>Milling-Stanley said this was due to sentiment in the market being undermined by fears of central banks selling from reserves to meet European Monetary Union convergence criteria, although there was no evidence of any actual new selling.</p>
<p>&quot;The net effect was a lot of short selling during the first quarter and many speculators are still holding these positions. That is what did the damage to price. It was nothing to do with demand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The gold price would rise if they switch to the long side and that would be no problem for demand,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Overall, he said, growth of personal income in the major gold jewellery buying areas like India, the Middle East and South East Asia was growing faster than new gold supply.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as demand growth is concerned rising personal income is more important than the actual gold price,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>New gold mine production had increased by one percent a year so far in the 1990s and was estimated to increase by 3.50 to four percent during the coming three to five years. In comparison jewellery demand had risen by four to five percent on average for many years.</p>
<p>Milling-Stanley said it was unlikely that gold demand would be seriously affected as savings patterns became more sophisticated in key markets like India.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important concept is (gold as) a store of value. Indians don't rush out to sell gold if the price goes up five dollars,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But demand fell in China by seven percent to 55 tonnes, reflecting consumers' financial and economic concerns. Also, gold jewellery demand in China was hit by &quot;tremendous growth&quot; in platinum and gem-set jewellery on which there were no government restrictions.</p>
<p>&quot;Platinum and gem-set sales have grown to almost two percent of the gold jewellery market. Platinum has not taken an appreciable market share from gold,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Johnson Matthey the largest refiner of platinum group metals, said in its Platinum 1997 survey of the market that platinum imports to China last year rose 54 per cent to a record 200,000 ounces (6.22 tonnes) making it the second largest market for platinum jewellery after Japan.</p>
