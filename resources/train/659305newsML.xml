<p>Little progress has been made in naphtha term contract talks between Asian customers and Middle Eastern suppliers, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, oil product traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) is offering a $20 premium for one-year supply contracts starting in August.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as KPC keeps its offer at $20, there will be little progress in the talks,&quot; one naphtha trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible for petrochemical end-users to pay such a high premium for full-range naphtha,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Information on bidding levels for KPC material was scattered, but one South Korean buyer was said to have placed a bid at $13.50 per tonne over the mean of Middle Eastern quotes, and one Japanese firm at as low as around $8.00.</p>
<p>The premium for the current term year that started last August is $7.90, and the premium for holders of term contracts which began in March is $13.50.</p>
<p>In term talks with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) for annual contracts starting in July, negotiations were deadlocked.</p>
<p>Clients' bids were at around $19 to $20 per tonne over the ADNOC formula for pentane-plus and &quot;low-sulphur naphtha,&quot; while ADNOC's offer was $21.75, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting for ADNOC's offer price to come down a little bit more,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>For the current term year, the ADNOC naphtha premium is $6.80.</p>
<p>Japan and South Korea are expected to import about two million tonnes of Kuwaiti naphtha, and 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes of ADNOC naphtha in the new term year, traders said.</p>
