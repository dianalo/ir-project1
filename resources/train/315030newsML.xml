<p>U.S. and Thai defence officials are discussing the possible sharing of U.S. satellite information with Thailand, but no decision has been reached, the U.S. Defence Department said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent stories in the press of proposed U.S.-Thai cooperation on satellite use are somewhat inaccurate,&quot; Air Force Lt. Col. Queenie Byars, a Pentagon spokeswoman, told Reuters in response to questions. She declined to say whether sensitive intelligence satellites were involved.</p>
<p>According to Thai newspaper reports, Thailand is trying to cut its budget and is seeking an arrangement under which it would receive regional defence intelligence information from U.S. satellites.</p>
<p>The reports have suggested that the information would be provided without charge, but the Pentagon declined to provide details.</p>
<p>&quot;The Department of Defence has held preliminary discussions with the royal Thai military regarding cooperation in military satellite communications,&quot; Byars said.</p>
<p>&quot;A Defence Department team visited Thailand in early January to discuss this issue further. As discussions on possible cooperation are on-going, it would be inappropriate top speculate on their outcome,&quot; she added.</p>
