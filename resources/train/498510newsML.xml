<headline>New Cyprus cabinet sworn in after reshuffle.</headline>

<p>Five new members of the eleven member Cyprus cabinet were sworn in on Wednesday after the first reshuffle in the centre-right government since it came to power in 1993.</p>
<p>Among the new appointees, former government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides took over as foreign minister, replacing Alecos Michaelides who was among those dismissed.</p>
<p>The cabinet shake up on Tuesday was the first since veteran right-wing politician Glafcos Clerides was elected for a five year term in February 1993.</p>
<p>Government officials have described the reshuffle as an act of renewal, and not an indication that Clerides was displeased with the job of any minister. But opposition parties quickly branded it as a sign of government failure.</p>
<p>The government has been dismissive of suggestions the reshuffle aims at boosting Clerides's re-election chances in a poll due in less than a year. Clerides has not given a firm answer on whether he will run again.</p>
<p>The ministries of justice, education, health and communications were given to new appointees, while all other ministers, including finance, kept their jobs.</p>
<p>Five of those unaffected are members of the centre-right Democratic Party, junior partner in the government. The remainder were members of the right-wing Democratic Rally party.</p>
<p>Clerides's Greek Cypriot administration is recognised as the only legitimate government in Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkey invaded its north in 1974 in response to a brief coup engineered by the colonels ruling in Greece at the time.</p>
