<title>MAURITANIA: Virus kills rare Mauritanian monk seals.</title>

<p>More than 60 monk seals, one of the world's most endangered species, have been killed by a virus and not toxic algae as previously thought, researchers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The dead seals were washed up on Mauritania's Atlantic coast last month near the port of Nouadhibou.</p>
<p>Mauritanian, Spanish, Dutch and Irish scientists, working with the national oceanographic and fisheries research centre, initially thought the seals had been poisoned by eating fish which had swallowed the algae.</p>
<p>The seals were part of a colony previously estimated at 150, living off the Mauritanian coast. Ecologists say the species numbers no more than 350 worldwide.</p>
<p>So called because folds of skin around their necks recall monastic dress, they are among the last members of the seal family living in temperate waters in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Four baby monk seals were rescued and are being treated in the centre's aquarium in Nouadhibou.</p>
<p>An epidemic which came from a virus causing distemper in dogs killed at least 17,000 seals in northern Europe in the summer of 1988.</p>
<p>Dutch researchers said highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may have made the North Sea seals more vulnerable.</p>
<p>A study found that seals with high PCB levels suffered from major vitamin A deficiency and reduced thyroid hormones -- substances linked to the efficiency of the immune system.</p>
