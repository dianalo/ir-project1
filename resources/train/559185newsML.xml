<headline>Nestle propels Nigerian stocks higher with result.</headline>
<dateline>LAGOS 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Nigerian share trading was boosted on Monday by an impressive full year result from food and beverages market leader Nestle Plc, dealers said.</p>
<p>The all-share index shot to 8,707.73 from 8687.91 on Friday when prices fell across the board on profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nestle results jolted the market up from the bout of price depreciation last week,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The company said after tax profit for the year ended December 1996 doubled to 1.2 billion naira from 612.8 million in 1995. Turnover was 6.1 billion naira from 4.4 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly Nestle stock just seems so dear and everyone wants a slice,&quot; said one trader, referring to a scramble to buy following the release of the company's 1996 results.</p>
<p>Nestle led the pack of gainers, chalking 3.53 naira to close at 74.13 naira on Monday. It becomes the highest-priced stock on the Nigerian bourse, taking over from oil marketer Unipetrol which slumped 80 kobo to 72.00 naira.</p>
<p>Fellow oil marketer Total fell 70 kobo to 60.00 naira and dealers said both moves were attributable to low demand for their stock.</p>
<p>Other major changes were Texaco, which rose 1.00 naira to 47.50 and Mobil, which was up 20 kobo at 62.00 naira.</p>
<p>Traders said the two moves were in anticipation of good results from the two oil marketers over the next few weeks.</p>
