<title>UK: Traders wary of electronic threat to LIFFE T-bonds.</title>
<headline>Traders wary of electronic threat to LIFFE T-bonds.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>By Lisa Wilson, reporting from the LIFFE floor</p>
<p>As open outcry in the new T-bond futures and options, part of the link between two top exchanges, started on Friday, LIFFE traders were concerned existing after-hours trading might hit new T-bond volumes.</p>
<p>The link allowing Bunds and T-bonds to be traded on both the London International Financial Futures and options Exchange (LIFFE) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) must co-exist with electronic sessions used by the exchanges.</p>
<p>LIFFE's APT and CBOT's Project A will both continue to trade.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard for the new T-bond to compete with a stable settled system,&quot; said a trader at a British house who was in the LIFFE T-bond pit at the open. &quot;With Project A trading there's no natural business.&quot;</p>
<p>However some investors still preferred open outcry and could therefore be attracted by the new contract, he said.</p>
<p>Other traders, sporting baseball caps handed out by the London Monarchs, a UK-based American football team, said the new contract would enhance LIFFE's prestige.</p>
<p>Jack Wigglesworth, chairman of LIFFE, told Reuters there had been worries about the drain on volume caused by electronic systems when the agreement to leave them untouched was announced earlier in the year. But he said that was not a major issue now.</p>
<p>&quot;The presence of electronic trading could allow arbitrage and having a new contract could attract new business,&quot; Wigglesworth told Reuters in an interview with Reuters Financial Television to be aired later.</p>
<p>He said while there was no specific clause in the agreement between LIFFE and the CBOT to allow changes in APT and Project A, both the boards would re-examine all the issues if volume failed to reach expectations.</p>
<p>He said &quot;a few thousand&quot; lots per day in the early days would provide a good start. June T-bond futures on LIFFE had traded more than 3,000 lots by 1000 GMT.</p>
<p>There was a relatively strong presence from U.S. traders in the new T-bond pit, but some said they were disappointed by the level of activity.</p>
<p>One trader suggested the pit, which sits next to gilts, would have been better located next to Bunds, which have seen increasing interest from U.S. traders.</p>
<p>Wigglesworth said the Bund futures -- which would now be traded from 4.20 pm London local time (1520 GMT) on the CBOT -- would allow U.S. investors to gain a foothold in Europe ahead of European Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear that the Bund will be the benchmark euro contract,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wigglesworth said some LIFFE traders had been persuaded to go to Chicago to add expertise and liquidity to the embryonic Bunds. &quot;But perhaps there is little for the UK traders to teach those in the U.S.,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The next stage of the link will include the addition on LIFFE of the U.S. 10-year and five-year T-note contracts and on CBOT of the British and Italian government bond contracts. No time scale has yet been arranged for this.</p>
