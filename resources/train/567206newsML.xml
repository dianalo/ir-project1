<p>As if Britain's bond market did not have enough going for it, the charts are also in its favour these days, say technical analysts.</p>
<p>Ignited by sweeping reforms to the Bank of England, British gilts staged their biggest one-day gain in five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday, after scrutinising charts dating back to 1986, analysts said the market had more life in it yet.</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell technical analyst Elizabeth Miller said the rally, while fundamentally inspired, was a strong signal. &quot;Obviously it makes it pretty bullish on the charts.&quot;</p>
<p>June gilt futures on LIFFE at 1312 GMT were at 113-04, off 9/32 from the prior close. On Tuesday, they soared to a contract high of 113-24, more than two and a half points above the London close on Friday of 111-04.</p>
<p>While short-term profit-taking will probably restrain the gilt market for a while, some technical analysts see gains of around four full points from here in the longer run.</p>
<p>British markets, which were shut on Monday for a holiday, were greeted with the news on Tuesday that new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown was giving the Bank of England greater independence.</p>
<p>The reforms, which include setting up a monetary policy committee on which the government has no vote, cheered sterling-based investors who now see politics taking a backseat to prudent interest rate policy.</p>
<p>Francoise Skelley, head of global trading technical analysis at Credit Suisse First Boston in London, said monthly continuation charts dating back to 1986 showed a downtrend line in place that currently came in the 117-118 area.</p>
<p>She told Reuters Financial Television the market was vulnerable to a pullback but that that line would act as a target on the upside.</p>
<p>&quot;Short-term the market is very overbought,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>For Miller, the key was to get back, and stay, above 113-19, which was a former contract high which gilts took out during their blistering rally on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Really it looks pretty good at the moment but it's got to sustain a break of 113-19. Gains from here are going to be a lot slower,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The short-term caution that many analysts currently hold on gilts extends to the long term for some chartists.</p>
<p>Anne Whitby, head of technical analysis at 4CAST in London, was sceptical gilts would even get up to the 11-year-old resistance line, which she pegged at 117-12.</p>
<p>&quot;I still don't think it's the beginning of something new and exciting and different,&quot; Whitby said. &quot;I think it's a sluggish rally.&quot;</p>
<p>She said she could envision the market rising to the 115-00 to 116-00 area. &quot;Beyond that I wouldn't really be looking for much.&quot;</p>
<p>And Skelley, who set the downtrend line target just above 117-00, added that she did expect gilts to falter up there.</p>
