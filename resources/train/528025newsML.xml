<p>Shanghai's B shares ended down on Tuesday on a technical correction triggered by selling in stocks expected to issue poor 1996 results, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index fell 0.973 points or 1.11 percent to 86.557 points on volume of 44.874 million shares worth $26.931 million, compared with $36.359 million yuan on Monday.</p>
<p>Brokers said selling in shares expected to post poor 1996 results pulled the index down, but market sentiment is still good following the solid gains of the past few sessions.</p>
<p>Of 43 B share companies, two-thirds have yet to issue their 1996 results with April 30 deadline approaching.  </p>
<p>Huaxin Cement 1996 net profits plunged 63.87 percent, the company statement said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Its poor result led to selling in other stocks expected to issue poor results for 1996, brokers said.</p>
<p>Huaxin was the second biggest loser on unwinding selling, slipping $0.022 or 7.43 percent to $0.274 on volume of 1.9 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Active bargain-hunting prevented the index from losing further,&quot; one broker said. &quot;Most investors believe that the market can see the index hitting 100 points in the near future.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected support around 85 points.  </p>
<p>All 43 B shares traded, with 32 down, two flat and nine up.</p>
<p>Shanghai Automation Instrument was the biggest loser on expectations of unpromising results, tumbling $0.020 or 7.93 percent to $0.232 on volume of 1.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai Refrigerator Compressor was the most actively traded on talk of possible lower-than-expected results, slipping $0.020 or 2.91 percent to $0.666 on volume of 3.8 million shares.</p>
<p>But the Shanghai A share index continued to rise on bullish sentiment, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The index put on 4.096 points or 0.29 percent to 1,428.202 points on volume of 964.9 million shares worth 11.7 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE30 index edged up 1.037 points or 0.03 percent to 3,683.373 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Video &amp; Audio Electronics was the star after its recently-announced financial restructuring, up 1.28 yuan or 10.03 percent to 14.03 yuan on volume of 11.8 million shares.</p>
