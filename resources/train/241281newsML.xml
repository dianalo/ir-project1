<p>Hang Seng Index futures for forward months dipped after trading resumed on Friday afternoon following a brief suspension in late morning, but then began retracing some ground, traders said.</p>
<p>January futures slid 640 points to 12,970 at the start of the afternoon session, but later recovered to 13,130. March fell 630 to 13,045 at the start of the session.</p>
<p>They were last traded in the morning down 450 and 420 points respectively before being suspended.</p>
<p>&quot;There was still some stop-loss selling in the market in early afternoon but now we see slight rebound,&quot; Gary Wong of Peregrine Derivatives said.</p>
<p>Activity was focused on the spot month, December, as hedge funds rushed to sell earlier in reaction to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's speech overnight.</p>
<p>Greenspan said Fed need not be concerned with collapsing financial asset bubble if it does not threaten real economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been overreacted (to the news) and I bet the Hang Seng Index should manage to close above the 13,000 level,&quot; Wong said.</p>
<p>December stood at 13,070, down 475 points against the low of 12,915. Turnover teached 24,039 contracts in late afternoon.</p>
