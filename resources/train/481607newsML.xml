<title>ISRAEL: KFC opens restaurant in Gaza Strip.</title>
<headline>KFC opens restaurant in Gaza Strip.</headline>
<dateline>GAZA 1997-04-02</dateline>

<p>Palestinians locked in the Gaza Strip under an Israeli closure got their first tast of American fast food on Wednesday when Kentucky Fried Chicken opened a franchise in the self-ruled territory.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm really glad that we have such fast food,&quot; customer Farid Ayyad told Reuters. &quot;I used to go abroad and have meals in these restaurants and I'm glad we have it now in our country.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaki Ghalli, one of three Gazan businessmen who bought the franchise through KFC regional headquarters in Cairo, said the restaurant imported all ingredients save produce from Egypt.</p>
<p>&quot;We even import the chicken,&quot; Ghalli told Reuters.</p>
<p>One Palestinian protester used the restaurant's grand opening to vent anger at the United States, which last month twice vetoed United Nations resolutions censuring Israel's construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;No to the American veto,&quot; read a sign posted by the protester on Gaza City's main Omar Mukhtar street.</p>
<p>Customers were unfazed: &quot;There is a difference between politics and food,&quot; Ayyad said.</p>
<p>Ghalli said an Israeli closure of the Gaza Strip had delayed the franchise's grand opening.</p>
<p>&quot;We were supposed to open last month but we had problems becasue of the closure. The Israelis do not allow food to cross easily,&quot; Ghalli said.</p>
<p>Israel periodically seals off its borders with the impoverished Strip for security reasons. A 1993 Israeli-PLO peace deal launched Palestinian self-rule in Gaza but left Israel with overall security control at border crossings.</p>
