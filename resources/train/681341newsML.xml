<p>Inspiring to some, humiliating or infuriating to others, U.S. President Bill Clinton's lessons in economics and job creation at a weekend Group of Seven summit in Denver drew mixed reviews in Europe on Monday.</p>
<p>There was no dispute that the main message of the annual G7 summit was that Europe's three biggest economies -- Germany, France and Italy -- need to deregulate and be more flexible to overcome mass unemployment and stay competitive.</p>
<p>But while German and Italian commentators sounded willing to accept the advice with humility, the French were predictably piqued by what many Paris editorialists saw as Clinton's Wild West arrogance.</p>
<p>The refusal of French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to don cowboy boots and Stetson hats given to them as gifts by Clinton seemed to symbolise European reluctance to adopt the American model wholesale.</p>
<p>France's conservative Le Figaro said the incident summed up the summit. &quot;Faced with an America which loves to show off, faced with a sole superpower in the midst of an economic boom, which projects itself today as a universal model, the Europeans preferred to stand on their dignity,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Le Figaro bridled not only at Clinton's economics lesson but also at his attempt to dictate unilaterally which east European countries may join the 16-nation NATO alliance.</p>
<p>France's LCI television station said in its main bulletin: &quot;Denver, showcase of a triumphant America. At the G8 summit (some media count Russia as the eighth member), backed by the power of the American economy, Bill Clinton imposed his vision of the world -- from unemployment to Africa including NATO.&quot;</p>
<p>And the left-wing daily Liberation asked in an editorial: &quot;Is there only a single valid model of capitalism on the entire face of the earth?&quot;</p>
<p>But elsewhere, there was more sympathy for the master class in free-market economics administered by a U.S. president regarded as left-of-centre in his own country.</p>
<p>Centre-right Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said Germany could learn a lot from America's &quot;job miracle&quot;. Germans could increase employment if companies were able to offer workers more flexible work contracts, he told Inforadio in Berlin.</p>
<p>The liberal Sueddeutsche Zeitung and the conservative Die Welt both commented that Germany, France and Italy had been warned unequivocally to shake up their heavily regulated economies to enable job creation.</p>
<p>Italy's daily La Stampa said the G7 summit showed there was no practical alternative to the glowing globalisation of the world economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there were a few grumbles, Europe had to recognise the truth of the American formula to create jobs and economic development without inflation,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>In Britain, which under ex-prime minister Margaret Thatcher deregulated its economy along American lines in the 1980s, there was no objection to Clinton's jobs homily, but some unease with his refusal to accept binding restrictions on air pollution by American industry.</p>
<p>Right-wing daily The Times commented: &quot;Even such passionate advocates of the European economic model as Helmut Kohl and (European Commission president) Jacques Santer showed signs of recognising the potency of the American formula based on competitive markets, modest government spending and a monetary policy designed to foster economic expansion and allow the creation of jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>But the left-of-centre Guardian highlighted the clash between the United States and the Europeans on environmental protection, saying British Prime Minister Tony Blair's speech to Monday's U.N. Earth Summit read like &quot;a thinly disguised attack on America&quot;.</p>
