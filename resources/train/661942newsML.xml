<p>India on Saturday vehemently denied a U.S. newspaper report that Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral had promised not to deploy Prithvi missiles after Washington informed him that some had been moved near Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry released a statement calling the Washington Post report &quot;false, mischievous and motivated&quot;, a day after Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav said India would deploy the ballistic missiles only if Pakistan attacked.</p>
<p>&quot;India has developed Prithvi missiles for (the) country's protection from an attack,&quot; Yadav was quoted by the Press Trust of India (PTI) as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;If Pakistan attacks India, then only will we deploy these missiles to repulse the attack,&quot; he said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Washington Post last week cited U.S. intelligence saying India had moved fewer than a dozen of the medium-range missiles to a prospective launch site near the border with Pakistan. The reported move drew a strong condemnation from Pakistan.</p>
<p>Gujral said on Wednesday that no Prithvis had been deployed. He did not comment on Indian newspaper reports that the military had stored, but not deployed, the missiles near Pakistan.</p>
<p>In Thursday's editions, the Post said U.S. intelligence detected the missiles' movement towards the Pakistan border while it was underway and administration officials protested to Gujral.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Gujral told Washington that Indian army officials had orchestrated the movement without his advance knowledge or approval and that he would prevent any further shift of missiles toward the border.</p>
<p>Gujral also promised he would keep the missiles from being deployed, the Post said.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry statement said the government had seen the Washington Post reports and already categorically denied that the Prithvi missiles had been deployed.</p>
<p>&quot;We equally categorically reject other aspects of the Washington Post reports regarding details of diplomatic exchanges with the United States as false, mischievous and motivated,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The statement said the newspaper reports were based on selective leaks from U.S. intelligence and official sources. &quot;It has been our experience that such stories are tendentious, planted deliberately to create confusion,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is Government's clear policy that decisions regarding Prithvi or other such matters will be taken in the light of our independent foreign policy and on the basis of our security perception,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been pointed out that there is no imminent threat and thus no reason for deployment.&quot;</p>
<p>The newspaper reports raised questions ahead of the resumption of peace talks between Indian and Pakistan next week.</p>
<p>Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan accused India on Thursday of raising tensions before the fourth round of bilateral peace talks in Islamabad starting on June 19.</p>
<p>Pakistan said on Friday it had urged the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to restrain India from posing a missile threat to it.</p>
<p>Indian officials visiting Washington said on Friday that the missile reports would not affect the talks.</p>
<p>The two countries have fought three wars since 1947, two of them over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir. The last round of talks in January 1994 derailed over Kashmir.</p>
