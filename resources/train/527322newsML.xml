<p>Swedbank said on Tuesday that Lithuania's economic situation is relatively healthy and that much depended now on completing its privatisations and maintaining trust in the litas currency.</p>
<p>Some three to four percent growth can be expected in Lithuania in 1997 and 1998, Swedbank said.</p>
<p>The bank said in an analysis of eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, that in the coming years much depended on the government's ability to carry out privatisation and bring in more foreign investment.</p>
<p>Lithuania's right-wing government, which was swept back to power in elections late last year, declared it would carry out privatisation of telecom and energy companies and airlines.</p>
<p>The bank forecast inflation at 15 percent in the coming years.</p>
<p>Swedbank also pointed to talks on a new agreement with the IMF to determine conditions for the change of the monetary system from the currency board to a more active monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important no hasty steps are taken which diminish trust in the currency and drive up inflation again,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Lithuania wants to end the currency board system of fixing the litas to the dollar but has said any change will take place gradually. It has said the peg will stay in place but will be maintained by active monetary control rather than the board.</p>
<p>State finances are under relatively good control and the deficit is smaller than the two percent of GDP demanded by IMF guidelines, Swedbank added.</p>
<p>But it noted that the tax system should be changed and improved to increase revenues.</p>
