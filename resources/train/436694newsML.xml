<headline>FTC find Gerber babyfood claim &quot;deceptive&quot;.</headline>

<p>Gerber has promised to halt &quot;deceptive&quot; claims that four out of five pediatricians recommend its baby food, the government announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission announced that Gerber Products Co. relied on a survey of 562 doctors that found only 67 -- barely more than one in 10 -- recommended Gerber baby food.</p>
<p>&quot;Advertising that relies upon deceptive doctor recommendations for baby foods is especially troubling in as much as accurate expert advise is critical to reaching these important decisions about child care,&quot; Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bernstein said the ad campaign, which ran on television, radio and in print, &quot;skewed the results of the study by weeding out doctors&quot; who didn't give the desired answers.</p>
<p>The study found that of the 562 doctors surveyed, 408 recommended baby food at least once a week, 76 recommended a specific brand of baby food and 67 recommend Gerber brand.</p>
<p>Gerber advertised that four out of five doctors who recommended baby food recommend Gerber but in fact only 16 percent -- or 67 out of 408 -- recommended Gerber, the FTC said. Beyond that, the FTC said the ads &quot;made a broader implied claim that four out of five pedicatricians recommend Gerber.&quot;</p>
<p>Gerber, a division of Swiss pharmaceutical and chemical company Novartis, acknowledged problems with its ad.</p>
<p>&quot;We acknowledge the advertisement perhaps inaccurately confused the message of the survey,&quot; said Van Hindes, director of corporate affairs for Gerber, speaking from company headquarters in Fremont, Mich.</p>
