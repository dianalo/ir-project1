<p>The World Bank on Thursday urged all countries to phase out the use of lead in gasoline within the next five years in a call to action ahead of the United Nations Earth Summit later this month.</p>
<p>World leaders are set to gather at the United Nations on June 23 to discuss progress on dealing with issues such as air pollution, water conservation and wildlife protections.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concerned that progress in the five years since the Rio Summit has been inadequate and that there's a serious risk of loss of momentum and retreat indeed from the (summit's) goals,&quot; said Caio Koch-Weser, the World Bank's managing director of operations.</p>
<p>Pollution was still getting worse in many major cities, and forests and wildlife habitats were being lost at the same rate as before Rio, he said.</p>
<p>World Bank officials said leaded gasoline could easily be phased out to help curb air pollution and health problems.</p>
<p>Lead is believed to cause neurological damage and heart disease among children.</p>
<p>In the five years since the Rio Summit, lead use in gasoline in Latin America has fallen by two-thirds, and in Bangkok, Thailand it was phased out in less than three years.</p>
<p>&quot;In other parts of the world we've not seen that, and we really do believe this is one of those actions that could be taken today,&quot; said Andrew Steer, director of the World Bank's environment department.</p>
<p>The World Bank said it was ready to help governments introduce programs to switch to unleaded gasoline, a conversion that it said would result in big savings in health care and other spending in the long run.</p>
<p>Koch-Weser said governments should take more steps to eliminate the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and build a global carbon emissions market to stem climate change.</p>
<p>The World Bank said it was ready to create a &quot;carbon offset fund&quot; that would help countries meet their obligations to trim carbon emissions after 2000 under a climate agreement that is to be negotiated in Kyodo, Japan in December.</p>
<p>The fund would sell carbon credits to companies such as utilities in industrialized countries, then use the money on projects in developing countries to trim energy use and cut carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The World Bank called for governments to start treating water as &quot;a precious, economic resource,&quot; instead of encouraging waste through subsidies to cities and farm areas.</p>
<p>It also urged governments to start making cities more livable, stop subsidizing the use of natural resources, take more steps to preserve key habitats on land and in the oceans, and work with industries to adopt greener practices.</p>
