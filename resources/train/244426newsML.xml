<p>Dutch shares rebounded on Monday, trimming mor than half of Friday's stiff losses as conviction grew on bourses around Europe that last week's shakeout had been overdone.</p>
<p>Strong domestic bonds and a firm dollar provided the foundation for the AE index to rally at the open and, after backing up a little, a bullish Wall Street open nudged it close to day's highs at the close, dealers said.</p>
<p>But the prevailing mood on the market remained one of caution, both trader and analysts noted, with more volatility expected in the near term.</p>
<p>&quot;Stay close to home this week,&quot; one broker said. &quot;For now, all we can do i be patient and look for some clear direction,&quot; another concurred.</p>
<p>The AEX may have managed to claw back 7.64 of the 12.18 points it dropped on Friday after Fed Chairman Greenspan put the wind up world markets, but it still has a long way to go to repair all the chart damage done, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>The index will need to push forward strongly over 637.00, above its all-time high, to reconfirm a rising trend, one said.</p>
<p>Blue chips advanced strongly through the day, with Unilever and food concern Nutricia making the most ground in price terms.</p>
<p>Unilever rose 4.20 guilders to 290.70, after losing 7.50 guilders on Friday, while Nutricia made up 5.80 of the 9.30 guilder pasting it had suffered.</p>
<p>Smaller caps were the highest percentage gainers, with semiconductor concern ASM Lithography jumping almost seven percent and racking up the third largest volume on the exchange, as bargain hunters piled in.</p>
<p>Software house Cap Gemini was also seen as a steal after losing eight percent on Friday. Gemini's earnings per share are now expected to be &quot;way higher&quot; than estimated as its markets improve, one broker said. The stock rose 2.40 guilders, over five percent, to 47.50.</p>
