<headline>Poll indicates French less hostile to Le Pen.</headline>

<p>The first opinion poll after a shock victory of France's extreme-right National Front in a local vote which took on national significance shows the public at large less hostile than before to Jean-Marie Le Pen.</p>
<p>The poll, to be published on Tuesday, showed 18 percent of the French either wanted to help Le Pen or were glad he had gained politically.</p>
<p>A further 18 percent were indifferent to his progress while the number of those who feared him or wanted to fight him was 56 percent.</p>
<p>The poll, to be published in the daily Le Parisien newspaper said 64 percent of the French saw the Front as a danger for democracy but 70 percent also believed the party should be represented in parliament.</p>
<p>Although no direct comparisons could be made, most polls published until about a year ago showed over 85 percent of the French hostile to Le Pen who got close to 15 percent in presidential elections in May 1995.</p>
<p>Because of France's two-round electoral system, the Front has no representatives in parliament since no mainstream party has accepted electoral alliances with it.</p>
<p>The Parisien poll was published after the stunning victory on Sunday of Catherine Megret, 37, wife of the anti-immigration party's number two, in a municipal election in Vitrolles, north of Marseille.</p>
<p>It was the first time the National Front had won a head-to-head runoff with an absolute majority. Its previous successes had been in triangular contests against mainstream left and right-wing candidates.</p>
<p>Some commentators said before the opinion poll was published that Megret's election showed many French were no longer frightened by Le Pen but were increasingly seduced by his anti-establishment tirades.</p>
<p>Analyst Jean-Marc Lerch said the Front was now winning votes more because of its charges of corruption against the political establishment than due to its traditional themes of immigration and insecurity.</p>
<p>The Sunday vote drew special attention because specialists say the Front could win enough votes to influence the outcome of the March 1998 general election by maintaining its candidates on the second round in up to 200 constituencies.</p>
<p>The Parisien poll was conducted on Monday among 1,008 people.</p>
<p>It poll showed 82 percent of the French believed the best way to counter National Front advances was for the political establishment to be more attentive to the everyday concerns of the public.</p>
<p>It also showed 18 percent of people who identified themselves as sympathisers of France's centre-right government parties were happy at Le Pen's progress, confirming the views of some specialists that the Front was biting into the mainstream right's voting public.</p>
