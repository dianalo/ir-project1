<p>Only 765,332 voters in 36 constituencies are going to the polls at Singapore's general election on Thursday, official figures show.</p>
<p>This is less than half the total of 1.88 million eligible electors in Singapore because most potential voters live in constituencies where the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has already been returned unopposed.</p>
<p>Polls opened at 192 centres across the island republic at 8.00 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Thursday and will close at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT).</p>
<p>The first results are expected at about 1430 GMT and the final result by 1600 GMT.</p>
<p>On nomination day on December 23, PAP candidates were unopposed for 47 of the 83 seats in the new parliament.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders have said they were not contesting most seats because their main aim was to win an alternative voice in parliament to check the PAP, rather than seize power.</p>
<p>With a PAP victory assured, it hoped voters would be more willing to vote for an opposition voice in parliament.</p>
<p>The theory is that many voters credit the PAP with doing well in building the country's prosperity, so want it to stay in power, but also want other views represented in parliament.</p>
<p>Before parliament was dissolved for the elections, opposition parties held just four seats of the then 81 total. Redrawn constituencies enlarge the next parliament by two seats.</p>
<p>Under recent revisions to Singapore's constitution there are two types of parliamentary constituencies -- single seats and multi-member group representation constituencies (GRCs)</p>
<p>Single seats elect one member of parliament (MP) from a constituency of around 20,000 electors, while GRCs elect between four and six MPs on a winner-takes-all slate.</p>
<p>Votes in both types of constituencies are counted on the basis of first-past-the-post where the largest number of votes takes the whole constituency, even if it is a minority of the votes cast.</p>
<p>Most of Singapore's top PAP politicians were already returned to parliament on nomination day, unopposed in GRCs. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, 55, won with five other PAP candidates in his Marine Parade seat on the island's east coast.</p>
<p>Singapore patriarch and senior minister Lee Kuan Yew, 73, was returned unopposed with five others in Tanjong Pagar which covers an area west of the central business district.</p>
<p>Nine other ministers were also returned unopposed but seven ministers are fighting election battles.</p>
<p>There are 75 candidates standing for the 36 contested seats. Nine seats are in single-seat wards while 27 are in six GRCs.</p>
<p>In the last general election in 1991, opposition parties won four seats. The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) took Bukit Gombak, Nee Soon Central and Potong Pasir while the Workers' Party (WP) took Hougang constituency. The SDP MP in Potong Pasir has since joined the Singapore People's Party (SPP).</p>
<p>Six parties are standing in Thursday's election with the WP, led by 70-year old lawyer and veteran campaigner Joshua Jeyaretnam, fielding 14 candidates.</p>
<p>Jeyaretnam heads a team of five WP candidates in the Cheng San GRC which has become the most watched seat of the campaign in an increasingly bitter battle between the PAP and leading WP candidate, Tang Liang Hong, on the issue of race.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Goh has accused Tang of Chinese chauvinism and endangering Singapore's multiracial society. Tang has denied this and countered with remarks about Goh and PAP ministers. Both sides have promised legal action after the election.</p>
<p>Another key seat is MacPherson where Singapore Democratic Party leader Chee Soon Juan is in a head-to-head battle with PAP senior parliamentary secretary Matthias Yao Chih.</p>
