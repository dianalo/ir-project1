<title>UK: SOCCER-KLINSMANN GIVES NO CLUES TO FUTURE.</title>

<p>Juergen Klinsmann arrived in Scotland on Monday for two friendlies but the Bayern Munich striker refused to say where he would like to play his soccer next season.</p>
<p>First, Klinsmann, now 32, wants to leading Bayern to the German league and cup double.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of my first season with Munich we lifted a European trophy (UEFA Cup) and that was followed by Germany winning Euro 96,&quot; said Klinsmann. &quot;It wouldn't be a bad way to complete the year with a double for Bayern and it is still possible.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is not right to comment on next season. There has been a lot of speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a few problems in the first part of the season but I guess that is normal too. I have a few possibilities at the end of the season.</p>
<p>&quot;I can stay at Bayern if I want to, I can leave if I want to. My aim is to play a real good second half to the season for Bayern, with the Bundesliga resuming on February 15.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still leading the title race and can win the cup as well. Those are two big aims for me and afterwards I will decide.&quot;</p>
<p>Bayern play Raith Rovers on Tuesday and Glasgow Celtic on Wednesday.</p>
