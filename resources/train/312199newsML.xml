<p>The average commitment rates on U.S. 30- and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages inched upward in the week ending January 17, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 30-year interest rate rose to an average 7.87 percent in the week from 7.85 percent the previous week, while the 15-year inched up to 7.38 percent from 7.35 percent.</p>
<p>Adjustable-rate mortgages also rose slightly in the week to an average 5.57 percent from 5.54 percent.</p>
<p>A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 7.02 percent, the 15-year 6.53 percent, and the ARM 5.48 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;Tuesday's release of the consumer price index showed a modest increase, which was in line with what the market was expecting,&quot; Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac deputy chief economist, said. &quot;This helped to comfort the market that price-inflation is under control.&quot;</p>
<p>The Labor Department on Tuesday said U.S. consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in December. &quot;Since this caused interest rates to move very little, mortgage rates remained almost exactly the same,&quot; Nothaft said.</p>
<p>Last Friday the Labor Department also reported a 262,000 increase in U.S. December nonfarm payrolls and a jobless rate of 5.3 percent.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac said lenders charged an average 1.8 percent in fees and points on 30-year loans, unchanged from last week. They charged 1.7 percent on the 15-year, down from 1.8 percent last week, and 1.4 percent on the ARM, unchanged from last week.</p>
