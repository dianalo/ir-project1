<p>Singapore share market ended mostly flat in lacklustre trade on Tuesday except for a flurry of late buying in national steel company NatSteel Ltd after some brokerage houses upgraded the stock, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The talking point today is NatSteel which saw strong buying interest after several houses upgraded the stock. Two foreign houses were seen actively buying,&quot; a dealer said. NatSteel rose S$0.18 (US$0.13) at S$2.72 on volume of 2.8 million shares.</p>
<p>The key Straits Times Industrials Index ended 5.55 points off at 2,070.23. Turnover was moderately light at 93.4 million shares, with gainers leading losers by 159 to 142.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was also speculative buying in Indonesian-linked stocks like United Pulp Paper and Van Der Horst.</p>
<p>Labroy Marine, which ended at S$1.23, topped the actives with 4.75 million shares on rumours of buying by a prominant Malaysian party.</p>
<p>Creative Technology led losers, shedding S$0.70 to S$9.10 on profit-taking after Monday's gains. &quot;Sentiment for the stock and the electronic sector has not really turned positive. It remains cautious,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>US$1.00=S$1.41</p>
