<headline>MCI says considers merger with British Telecom.</headline>

<p>MCI Communications Corp., the nation's second-largest long distance provider, said Friday it was in talks with British Telecommunications Plc on a possible merger of the two companies.</p>
<p>British Telecom already holds a 20 percent stake in MCI.</p>
<p>An MCI spokesman told Reuters the company expected the talks to be concluded this weekend, although he noted that there were no guarantees an agreement would be reached.</p>
<p>&quot;We have entered into negotations with BT on a possible business combination,&quot; the spokesman said, reading from a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Industry analysts applauded the talks, saying a combination of the two companies would be a good fit in the super-competitive U.S. long distance phone industry, where MCI and No. 3 Sprint have been battling an ailing AT&amp;T Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an extremely competitive business, and horizontal mergers like this make sense,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisors. &quot;The economies of scale in this case could be considerable, and the leverage in terms of potential profits is high ... It would be good purchase.&quot;</p>
<p>MCI's stock was halted for trading at $27.25, up $1.875 on Nasdaq, although it jumped as much as $5 to $30.625 after CNBC television reported that the companies were talking. The exchange said it would investigate those trades.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a good fit for British Telecom and provide a major foothold in this country,&quot; said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.</p>
<p>&quot;It wouldn't take away from the long-distance battle. Before that's over, there will be losers and winners,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>CNBC said Lazard Freres, MCI's investment bankers, and Morgan Stanley were working on the deal, which it said could be worth upward of $22 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes sense,&quot; said Kevin Haggerty, senior vice president and manager of equity trading at Fidelity Investments. &quot;I think BT is a great company.  The synergy is there. BT made a great initial investment.&quot;</p>
