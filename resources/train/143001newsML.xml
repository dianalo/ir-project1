<p>World copper prices have broken back above the psychological barrier of $2,000 per tonne and some traders said on Friday they saw potential for further gains as warehouse stocks tumble. Copper hit $2,027 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) late on Friday afternoon, perhaps at last shaking off the blues that have prevailed since the disgrace back in June of the Japanese mastermind of a high price trading strategy, Yasuo Hamanaka.</p>
<p>Some LME floor traders predict further gains, given that warehouse stocks of copper have fallen 60 percent from a peak last year to just 145,825 tonnes.</p>
<p>If data due next on Tuesday shows another big draw, they would be at the lowest for more than six years.</p>
<p>&quot;Comparing total stocks to prices (over the last 15 years) we estimate that the price of copper should be $1.10 per pound ($2,425/tonne),&quot; said Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Co, part of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>He estimated total stocks at around 3.5 weeks' consumption, not far above the all-time low of 3.1 weeks'.</p>
<p>But Bielski explained there were special factors in play which are limiting the market's upside potential.</p>
<p>One was the perception that long positions in copper were still being unwound by banks who took over the massive exposure of Sumitomo Corp of Japan, after it fired Hamanaka and alleged he had run up losses of $2.6 billion in rogue trades. Another was complacency about new supplies coming on stream next year from big mine expansions.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, looking into 1997, I don't think the market will be that far away from balance,&quot; Bielski said.</p>
<p>Floor traders added that there was a big question mark over whether the copper moving out of LME warehouses was being consumed or merely shifted to consumer yards in Europe, warehouses in China and to the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>But physical merchants were confident that copper offtake was picking up, justifying the decline in inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing good business in the U.S., good business in the Far East and a shortage of scrap forcing people to take more LME material as a substitue,&quot; said one European merchant.</p>
<p>And of the 40,000 tonnes going to China, the merchant estimated only 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes was likely to find its way back into LME warehouses in Singapore.</p>
<p>Other dampeners on the copper price were influential short position holders trying to protect their exposure and producers selling into rallies in case the market collapses, traders said.</p>
<p>Joining copper on its upward path this week has been aluminium, the second most heavily-traded of the LME contracts.</p>
<p>From a 2-1/2 year low of $1,305 a tonne earlier this month prices have recovered over 10 percent to a six-week high of $1,441 early on Friday.</p>
<p>Tightening nearby supplies and modest fund buying were behind the move, further boosted by market rumours that the six signatories to a 1994 production-cutting pact may be considering renewing the agreement to boost prices.</p>
<p>But Canadian sources in Moscow denied such intentions on Friday, knocking values off the highs.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the commodity markets, Chicago wheat futures remained weak around $3.85 per bushel after a surprise hike in the EU's export subsidy for wheat and dismal weekly U.S. wheat export sales.</p>
<p>Platinum fell below the price of gold for the first time in nearly three years in a technical market on which speculators have taken a negative view.</p>
<p>Gold closed slightly weaker in London at $382.65 an ounce, down 40 cents. Platinum ended at $383.40 having found some support after its drop to around $380-381.</p>
<p>Crude oil was little changed to just firmer. Some key commodity prices at 1600 GMT on Friday</p>
