<p>Benzene demand is set to grow by 4.5 percent a year through to 2002, fueled by strong demand from Asia excluding Japan, according to a study from Chemical Market Associates Inc.</p>
<p>Total world benzene demand will increase to 33.7 million tons in 2002 from 26.0 million tons in 1997, the study said.</p>
<p>Consumption in Asia outside Japan is set to grow at 12.2 percent a year, U.S. demand by 2.7 percent a year, in Western Europe by 1.8 percent and in Japan by 0.6 percent.</p>
<p>The study said that Western Europe and Japan are enacting legislation to limit the content of benzene in gasoline.</p>
<p>In the U.S. legislation resulted in relatively small amounts of new benzene production.</p>
<p>However, present higher dependence on benzene for reformulating gasoline in Japan and Western Europe means that in the event of legislation on this, 1.0-1.5 million tons of benzene will need to be taken out of the gasoline pool and will go to chemical sales, said the CMAI report.</p>
<p>&quot;Many studies propose that the U.S. will become a large net exporter of benzene, but CMAI believes that the U.S. will remain a net importer and export more derivatives - and not just styrene,&quot; said the study.</p>
<p>The study says that paraxylene demand is growing at two- to three times the rate of benzene demand.</p>
<p>New technologies are also having an impact on the production of benzene, technologies called STDP and TPX from Mobil Corp are cutting the cost of paraxylene production, but CMAI says that the net production of benzene can be &quot;equal or greater than the new paraxylene output&quot;.</p>
<p>CMNA said that new technology from Chevron Corp to produce benzene from naptha in Saudi Arabia and Thailand, with a Venezuelan project under consideration, will continue to provide additional supply in the 500,000-700,000 ton range.</p>
<p>Also, the first world-scale liquified petroleum gas plant is under construction in Saudi Arabia and this will alter the benzene supply market after 1999/2000.</p>
<p>Among benzene derivatives, demand growth for ethylbenzene and styrene should continue to show strong growth at 4.4 percent a year worldwide.</p>
<p>Cumene and cyclohexane demand is set to grow much more strongly than benzene, at 4.4 percent and 5.2 percent a year respectively, CMAI said. ((-- David Chance New York Newsroom 212 859 1902))</p>
