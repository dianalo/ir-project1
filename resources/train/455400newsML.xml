<p>English second division soccer team Bournemouth won a stay of execution in their battle for survival on Thursday when the British tax authorities adjourned their attempts to have the club wound up.</p>
<p>The club's bank said the petition had been put on hold until May 15, allowing the south coast club to play out the season.</p>
<p>The club went into receivership in January with debts of 4.5 million pounds ($7.2 million), around half of which is owed to the bank. About 250,000 pounds ($400,000) is due to the tax authorities.</p>
<p>The job of the receiver is to sell assets as necessary in order to recover debts.</p>
<p>Fans of the club have raised over a million pounds ($1.6 million) in a bid to rescue the club and turn it into Britain's first &quot;community owned&quot; team.</p>
<p>Bournemouth is one of a number of lower division clubs facing a bleak future as more and more of the income from television deals and merchandising flows to the 20 teams in the elite premier league.</p>
