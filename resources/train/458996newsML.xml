<p>A U.S. citizen detained last year in Cuba will stand trial for subversive acts including smuggling military objects into the country and counter-revolutionary propaganda, state media said on Thursday.</p>
<p>State television said Walter Van Der Veer was &quot;an agent of a terrorist organisation in Miami&quot; and a &quot;highly dangerous mercenary.&quot;</p>
<p>It did not say when he would be tried or specify exactly what charges he faced. Neither did it indicate the prison term he might face if convicted.</p>
<p>But it said that during investigations into Van Der Veer, who was arrested last August in Havana, it was discovered that &quot;with the aim of subverting internal order and the stability of our country&quot; he had smuggled various military objects into the country.</p>
<p>He also carried out actions of propaganda using printed material calling for an uprising, and had plans against &quot;socio-economic, religious and military centers&quot; in Cuba, television said. It did not say what these centres were.</p>
<p>It said Van Der Veer's actions were carried out under the orders, help and financing of a Miami-based exile group called &quot;Cuban Liberation Front&quot;, but added that he also belonged to another similar group.</p>
<p>There are many groups dedicated to opposition to President Fidel Castro's government among the Cuban exile community in Miami, including some who say they are prepared to use violent methods. But action by paramilitary groups has been rare in Cuba.</p>
