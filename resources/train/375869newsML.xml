<p>France's decision to ban production of genetically-modified maize drew furious reactions from farmers on Thursday and drove a top scientist who led research for the government to resign.</p>
<p>&quot;The French government has banned sowings of a product it had itself promoted in Brussels. I cannot continue to work because my credibility with my European colleagues has been reduced to zero,&quot; Axel Kahn, the head of the independent Biomolecular Genetics Commission told Reuters.</p>
<p>Kahn's group had declared the maize safe and was at the forefront of French efforts to get the European Union to clear it. The European Union cleared the sale of gene-modified maize in December.</p>
<p>Farm Minister Philippe Vasseur announced the planting ban on Wednesday, saying the government wanted to move cautiously on an issue that has sparked protests from environmentalists and some consumer groups who say genetic techniques are a hazard.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage we must proceed with caution....we will not authorise the cultivation of gene-modified varieties this year,&quot; Vasseur told a news conference.</p>
<p>The decision came days after France said it would allow the imports of the maize, subject to labelling conditions.</p>
<p>French farmers union FNSEA reacted angrily to the decision, calling it &quot;incomprehensible.&quot;</p>
<p>It said the move would punish French farmers while failing to allay consumers' worries over the maize which was approved for import last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's decision is incoherent and creates competitive distortions between farmers in France and other countries,&quot; France's leading farm union said in a statement.</p>
<p>French maize producers said they were &quot;surprised&quot; by the decision, calling it &quot;paradoxical&quot; that France would ban production of a product it fought to introduce in the European Union.</p>
<p>French farmers, some of whom helped test the maize on behalf of Swiss inventor Ciba-Ceigy, had hoped for approval to grow the maize commercially in time for sowing in April.</p>
<p>Because the new strand is designed to resist the corn borer pest, which often results in part of the maize crop being lost, its use would have reduced the cost of buying insecticides.</p>
<p>Farmers say they have to use expensive air-spraying to fight the borer which attacks maize when the plants are high.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical group Novartis, the merged successor of Swiss groups Ciba-Ceigy and Sandoz, said the ban put French farmers at a competitive disadvantage,</p>
<p>&quot;This decision effectively takes a tool out of the farmers' hands and put them at a competitive disadvantage,&quot; a Novartis spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Environmental group Greenpeace, which has led protests against the maize being introduced to Europe, welcomed the government's decision to prevent it being grown locally.</p>
<p>&quot;It was high time France showed its determination not to accept cultivation of genetic maize,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>But it said the government should now go further and reverse its decision to allow the maize to be imported at all.</p>
<p>Maize is used mainly for feeding animals as well as starch production and appears as an ingredient in many processed foods.</p>
<p>France produced around 14 million tonnes of maize in 1996.</p>
