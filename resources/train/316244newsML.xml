<p>Vietnam's coffee trade was quiet on Friday following a midweek price hike.</p>
<p>Dealers said a consensus decision by several major players within the trade had seen the benchmark price rise to a fixed level of $990 a tonne FOB Saigon Port from around $940 a tonne earlier in the week.</p>
<p>As a consequence the market was inactive.</p>
<p>&quot;To be honest it's still an attractive price, but just not as attractive as it should be,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Farmers in the main producing area, Dak Lak province, were also holding back on supplies in the hope of a further price increase, but a local trader said he believed this was temporary only.</p>
<p>&quot;Tet (the lunar new year festival) is just around the corner. Most farmers will be looking to sell something just before then,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This year's Tet festival begins on February 6.</p>
<p>Vietnam, Asia's second largest robusta producer, came under pressure this week from members of the Inter African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to join a plan to trim exports.  </p>
<p>Members of a visiting IACO delegation were also hoping to petition government officials in Hanoi on Friday to join the Association of Coffee Producing Countries, but trade analysts said Vietnam was unlikely to shift from its existing position.</p>
<p>Regional dealers said news of a continuing strike by port workers in Colombia was unlikely to have any significant short-term impact on coffee futures prices in London and New York.</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting the market to take this in its stride. Based on previous experience trade is likely to react only very slowly,&quot; said a Singapore-based dealer.</p>
