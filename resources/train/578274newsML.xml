<headline>Trump Hotels wins court round against Pratt.</headline>
<dateline>TRENTON, N.J. 1997-05-13</dateline>

<p>Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc said Tuesday the appellate division of the New Jersey State Superior Court had unanimously upheld a lower court decision rejecting all claims by Pratt Hotel Corp against Trump Hotels Chairman Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The division upheld Judge Anthony Gibson's finding that Donald Trump did not interfere with the sale of a property to Pratt, a spokeswoman for Trump Hotels said.</p>
<p>Pratt Hotel had an initial deal to acquire the property from Penthouse but the Trump organization ended up buying it, the spokeswoman said.  </p>
<p>The court division upheld Gibson's rejection of Pratt's claim that Trump engaged in anti-competitive conduct or unfair competition by offering to buy the property if Pratt failed to close on its contract with Penthouse, Trump Hotels said.</p>
<p>Pratt alleged in a lawsuit that Donald Trump prevented it from buying the property or building the Sands Hollywod Hotel and Casino by engaging in discussions with Penthouse before the Pratt-Penthouse contract was terminated.  </p>
<p>Pratt officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>John Barry, Donald Trump's attorney, said in a statement that when it became clear to Trump that Pratt was unwilling and unable to close on the Penthouse contract, Trump let it be known that if the contract expired or was terminated, he was interested in the property.</p>
<p>Barry said the property was adjacent to Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino on the boardwalk in Atlantic City. &quot;Mr Trump recognized its potential to enhance the existing Trump property,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After buying the property, Trump built on it the Trump Plaza East Casino and the East Tower.</p>
