<title>SWITZERLAND: IATA attacks reported charges at new HK airport.</title>

<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said it was dismayed about rumours that point to a doubling of user charges at Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok (CLK), which is due to open in April 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;If confirmed the drastically increased charges could cost US$150 to a family of four travelling out of Hong Kong,&quot; it added in a statement and also described CLK as &quot;an airport for the rich&quot;.</p>
<p>It said that on a recent visit to Hong Kong, IATA director general, Pierre Jeanniot met with the Hong Kong Airport Authority and &quot;expressed the airlines' deep concern over the proposed increases in charges&quot;.</p>
<p>Separately in late November, IATA's representative in Hong Kong, Gilbert Chow, said research showed Boeing 747 landing fees at CLK could amount to US$12,000. This would be four times the present level and compares to the existing most expensive landing fee of US$9,000 at Osaka's Kansai airport.</p>
<p>IATA, which groups 254 airlines, said the economic significance of the new airport for Hong Kong's future was enormous.</p>
<p>&quot;A dramatic increase in CLK airport charges would have a deeply negative effect on the airport's utilisation and on Hong Kong's economy, and would jeopardise the status of Hong Kong as a centre of international and regional aviation, a status embodied in the territory's Basic Law,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Jeanniot said he had also raised the question of the sale of the old Kai Tak airport site with the Airport Authority, adding: &quot;It is our view that the users (airlines) should benefit from the (substantial) revenues that will arise from the lease and redevelopment of Kai Tak's land to partially offset the cost of CLK.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kai Tak is a fully depreciated asset (except for land) which has been paid for in charges. Also it is fundamental that all airport-related revenues stay at CLK and should be used against its costs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jeanniot said IATA wanted talks with the Hong Kong government over the user charge issue.</p>
<p>There should be a gradual approach, taking into account a long amortisation period in line with projected lifespan of the airport installations, instead of the proposed seven years, and the interests of Hong Kong citizens, he said.</p>
<p>An IATA spokesman said on Monday that the organization had made several requests for a further meeting with the Hong Kong government but no date had yet been agreed.</p>
<p>Industry sources said airlines with their hub operations based in Hong Kong -- Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Hong Kong Dragon Airlines -- would be the worst affected by the steeply higher charges.</p>
<p>It would also encourage much greater use of the rival Pearl River Estuary airports, especially for cargo operations, the sources said.</p>
<p>These airports are at Shenzen, near to Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai across the Pearl River, and both the existing and planned new Guangzhou airports.</p>
