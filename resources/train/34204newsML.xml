<p>Boris Yeltsin, breaking months of silence on his health, said on Thursday he would undergo heart surgery, probably at the end of the month in Moscow.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old Russian president, speaking slowly though with fleeting glimmers of his old sparkle, broke the news in a rare television interview. But he left unclear just how serious his condition was following two heart attacks last year.</p>
<p>&quot;I have undergone routine checks and during these checks they have found something wrong with my heart. Recommendations of doctors, our doctors, were for an operation or to work in a passive way,&quot; he told the little-known RIA television agency.</p>
<p>&quot;Passive work has never suited me. Nor can it suit me now. That's why an operation and full recovery, as they promise, is better for me than passive activity, passive work.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin's remarks ended more than two months of embarrassed equivocation by aides who have insisted his absence since late June was due only to the fatigue of his re-election campaign.</p>
<p>It was also another step in dismantling Soviet-era taboos on the health of Kremlin leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to have a society based on truth here, that means no longer hiding what we used to hide,&quot; Yeltsin said in the interview, which was aired by all Russia's main networks.</p>
<p>But despite his assurance of a full recovery the lack of any detail left the world guessing whether Moscow's first democratic leader would be able to see out his new four-year term.</p>
<p>Russian stock prices fell sharply on news of the operation and investors sold European currencies for dollars on fears that political upset in Moscow would spill westward.</p>
<p>It is not clear how much and for how long Yeltsin would be out of action. A Kremlin source told Reuters he expected routine bypass surgery, in which veins from the leg or chest replace clogged cardiac arteries to improve blood supply to the heart.</p>
<p>Bypass patients can return to active working lives within a month or so of surgery and can live for many years afterwards.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said the operation was likely to take place in late September in the elite Moscow Cardiological Centre. &quot;I do not want to go anywhere abroad,&quot; he said. &quot;Our cardiological centre in Moscow is capable of performing such heart operations.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin disappeared from view shortly before winning a second term on July 3. He has made only one public appearance since, looking and sounding stiff at his inauguration on August 9.</p>
<p>He looked tanned but tired on Thursday, similar to his appearance in previous brief, edited clips on television.</p>
<p>Aides had insisted the president was simply exhausted after a gruelling election campaign in which he fended off a strong communist challenge with an energetic meet-the-people campaign under the now somewhat ironic slogan &quot;Vote with Your Heart!&quot;.</p>
<p>His absence has sparked speculation on power struggles in the Kremlin. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who would take power temporarily if Yeltsin were unable to rule, and security chief Alexander Lebed are seen as rivals in the contest.</p>
<p>Some analysts predict that Yeltsin's chief of staff, Anatoly Chubais, would govern in his absence.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, apparently keen to prove he was still in command, took pains to pass comment on Thursday on the U.S. air raids on Iraq -- he backed his government's condemnation -- and on Lebed's peace deal in Chechnya -- he broadly approved.</p>
<p>Western leaders were greatly relieved when Yeltsin defeated his communist challenger, Gennady Zyuganov, in the election and U.S. President Bill Clinton wished him &quot;all the best for a full and speedy recovery&quot;, a White House spokesman said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin will meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Saturday at the Rus hunting lodge near Moscow where, a Kremlin source said, he had spent the last few days fishing.</p>
<p>The residence was a favourite of Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev during whose long decline pictures were faked and televised events specially staged to suggest he was well.</p>
<p>On a personal note, RIA quoted the president as saying in an unbroadcast part of the interview that his wife Naina would be home in a week after a kidney operation last month.</p>
