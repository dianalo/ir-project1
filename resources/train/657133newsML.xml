<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed sharply higher on Thursday for the second successive session, as demand outpaced supply, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed 10.1 points up at 773.6. Ceylon Cold Stores was nine rupees up at 150, Ceylon Brewery 3.75 at 79.75, Grain Elevators 1.50 to 25.50.</p>
<p>&quot;There is more demand than supply. But the situation is likely to change, because with every point the index rises, sellers seem more willing to give stock,&quot; said Sabri Marikar of John Keells Stock Brokers.</p>
<p>Turnover was 91 million rupees, with foreign buying accounting for 26.4 million rupees and selling, 11.1 million.  </p>
<p>Colombo stocks, which broke the psychological 750-point barrier on Wednesday after 22 months, are seen rising steadily on the back of good growth expectations, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still more room for the index to rise,&quot; said Gihan Rajapakse of CTC Eale Fund Management.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is reacting to fundamentals as you can clearly see from the way shares of companies which are expected to see good growth in 1997, are rising,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Analysts say the all share is likely to rise above 800 points by August.</p>
