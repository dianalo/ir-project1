<p>Manila stocks bounced back into positive territory at the close on Monday but not enough to match its jubilant opening as most investors waited for interest rates to fall, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like investors want to see stability first in the foreign exchange market before taking back positions,&quot; said Juanis Barredo, vice president at Citisecurities Inc.</p>
<p>The composite index climbed up from negative territory to end up 9.59 points at 2,710.73. It had gained 46 points after one hour of trade before falling to a low of 2,695.33  </p>
<p>Traders said market enthusiasm cooled down by midsession as investors realised that it would take at least a week before the Central Bank drops its overnight borrowing rate, which is currently pegged at 32 percent, to a lower level.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody's waiting for the market to calm down... the Central Bank is holding on to its shield,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Losers outpaced gainers 66 to 53, while prices of 61 issues remained unchanged, traders said.  </p>
<p>Firms that are expected to benefit the most from a depreciated peso like phone company PLDT, power firm Meralco B, and electronics firm Ionics continued to rise.</p>
<p>Other issues that joined the 7.57-percent rise of the market on Friday were hit by profit taking, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the market to take a cue from the foreign exchange market for the rest of the week.</p>
