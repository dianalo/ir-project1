<p>Austrian shares raced ahead on Monday as investors responded positively to the weekend appointment of Finance Minister Viktor Klima as the new chancellor.</p>
<p>&quot;Klima has the expert knowledge. He can do the job and he should bring political stability after two years of uncharacteristic uncertainty,&quot; said Roland Neuwirth, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>The ATX index of 21 blue-chip shares ended 9.9 points, or 0.85 percent, up at 1,176.07 having touched a session high of 1,176.64.</p>
<p>&quot;Austrian shares are clearly on an upward path,&quot; wrote Raiffeisen Zentralbank in an analysis, forecasting that the ATX index would set a new high in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Demand for ATX heavyweight Wienerberger contributed to Monday's strength, as did a record close in Frankfurt, traders said. Overall 14 ATX issues finished higher and seven lower.</p>
<p>Insurer EA-Generali was the biggest gainer, building on last week's advances to add on another 150 schillings, or 4.9 percent. Its shares closed at 3,210 schillings.</p>
<p>&quot;They're still profiting from the fact that they won't be buying into Creditanstalt,&quot; a trader said, referring to the firm's failed bid for Austria's second biggest bank.</p>
<p>Brickmaker Wienerberger climbed 93 schillings, or 4.52 percent, to 2,151. One trader traced the stock's strength to rumours Creditanstalt may be preparing to divest itself of some or all of its Wienerberger holding to a single buyer.</p>
<p>Fibre maker Lenzing continued its slump and was again the biggest decliner, falling 15 schillings, or 2.42 percent, to 605 schillings. Lenzing has said it expects its 1997 loss to exceed 1996 levels.</p>
<p>February ATX futures were up eight points at 1,182. The Vienna Bourse index rose 3.64 points to 439.4. -- Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254</p>
