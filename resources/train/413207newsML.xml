<p>Colin McRae was fortunate to remain in Kenya's Safari Rally on Sunday after spectators tried to sabotage his car on the second day's sixth stage.</p>
<p>Briton McRae, who led by more than eight minutes from Kenyan Ian Duncan in a Toyota after the seventh stage, lost three minutes at the service point after the incident, which damaged his steering rack, broke a wishbone and caused a puncture.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a one foot (30-cm) high wall of stones and we hit it flat out,&quot; said the Subaru driver.</p>
<p>&quot;The car jumped in the air and I thought we had taken the whole front end off. Luckily, we just damaged one corner very badly.&quot;</p>
<p>McRae took the lead in the morning's first stage, the fifth of the event.</p>
<p>Overnight leader German Armin Schwarz in a Ford encountered suspension problems which caused the tread on his tyres to peel off and he dropped to fourth.</p>
<p>Briton Richard Burns, second until the seventh stage, dropped to third when he stopped to mend a puncture and his Mitsubishi fell off the jack.</p>
<p>World champion Tommi Makinen became the latest casualty when he had three punctures in the fifth stage and was unable to continue the race.</p>
<p>The rally has already claimed world championship leaders Carlos Sainz of Spain and Kenneth Eriksson of Sweden, who both retired on the opening day.</p>
