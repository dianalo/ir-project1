<title>DENMARK: Danish shares close lower as budget talks collapse.</title>
<headline>Danish shares close lower as budget talks collapse.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish share prices closed lower on Friday hit by the collapse of 1997 budget negotiations between the government and the opposition Conservatives, with dealers fearing further falls ahead due to political unrest.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is now going to have to go out and find new partners for a 1997 budget deal, so this means the spectre of a new personal equity pension tax is still with us,&quot; one dealer said. The KFX top-20 index lost 0.71 point to 125.23 in overall bourse turnover of 659 million crowns. The KFX December future fell 0.20 point to 125.20 with 315 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.  </p>
<p>Falls were across the board with Tele Danmark shedding five crowns to close at 288, Novo Nordisk dropping six crowns to 962, and SAS Danmark the most traded paper with 155,000 shares changing hands to close two down at 70.</p>
<p>Bucking the trend thanks to the stronger British pound was Sophus Berendsen, which managed to finish 1.3 crowns higher at 719.3.</p>
