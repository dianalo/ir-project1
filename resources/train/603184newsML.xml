<headline>Costello says wages figures within expectations.</headline>

<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Wednesday today's wages data were consistent with government expectations but added that wages do not have to chase prices any more.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures that came out today were within the range that we have been targeting (namely) four to five percent,&quot; Costello told reporters.  </p>
<p>Figures released by the Department of Industrial Relations earlier showed Australian private sector enterprise wage deals concluded in the March quarter granted average annualised wage increases of 4.8 percent, up from 4.4 percent in the December quarter.</p>
<p>Enterprise wage deals in all sectors concluded in the March quarter paid average annualised rises of 4.7 percent, also up from 4.4 percent in the December quarter.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've always made the point that if we are going to keep inflation within our target, we want wage outcomes to be between four to five percent and the degree we can keep them under control is the degree to which we can have a good monetary policy,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>&quot;So today's figures are consistant with the kind of outcomes we've been expecting, but I would stress that wages don't have to chase prices any more,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia aims to keep underlying inflation between two and three percent over the course of a business cycle.  </p>
