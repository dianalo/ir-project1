<p>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</p>
<p>(1)  Beginning with the quarter ended June 28, 1996, the company changed its earnings presentation to exclude non-transportation activities from operating revenue and expense. These activities, principally real estate and resort operations, are now included in &quot;Other Income (Expense).&quot; Prior-year amounts have been restated to conform to the new presentation.  </p>
<p>(2)  During the quarter ended March 28, 1997, the company incurred net costs before income taxes of $24 million with respect to its investment in Conrail, Inc. (Conrail) common stock.  These net costs, principally interest on debt issued to acquire the investment less dividends received on the stock, reduced net earnings by $16 million, 7 cents per share.</p>
<p>At March 28, 1997, the company held shares equivalent to approximately 19.9% of the aggregate outstanding common and ESOP Preferred stock of Conrail (the Conrail shares).  The shares were acquired in November 1996 pursuant to a merger agreement entered into by the two companies in October 1996.  </p>
<p>The merger agreement was subsequently modified, including an amendment on March 7, 1997 to increase the price to be paid for the remaining outstanding Conrail shares to $115 cash per share and to permit the company to negotiate with Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) on a division of the Conrail rail system to achieve balanced rail competition in the Eastern United States. On April 8, 1997, the company and Norfolk Southern announced an agreement to form a jointly owned entity to acquire all outstanding Conrail shares for $115 cash per share.  </p>
<p>The agreement provides for the company to contribute $4.3 billion for its 42 percent share of the after for the remaining Conrail shares in May 1997 and place all Conrail shares in a voting trust pending approval of the proposed transaction by the Surface Transportation Board (STB).  The joint STB application is expected to be filed shortly after the acquisition of the remaining Conrail shares is completed. Additional information regarding the joint acquisition of Conrail is included in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 1997,  which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 24, 1997.  </p>
<p>At March 28, 1997, the company has accounted for its 19.9% investment in Conrail using the cost method.  Upon acquiring its additional interest in Conrail through the jointly owned entity and until STB approval and release of the Conrail shares from the voting trust, the company will account for the investment using the equity method.</p>
