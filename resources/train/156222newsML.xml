<p>A group of gunmen in jeeps attacked Liberia's Executive Mansion presidential complex on Thursday and panic erupted in the capital, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an attack on the mansion and shooting broke out,&quot; one witness said. &quot;Shops, businesses, markets and schools closed hurriedly and traffic came to a halt. People started running helter skelter, some with their belongings.&quot;</p>
<p>Radio reports said 10 people died in the shooting.</p>
<p>At least two wounded were taken to the nearby Barclay Training Centre army barracks, witnesses said. BTC was the bastion of ethnic Krahn guerrillas at the heart of militia warfare in the capital last April and May.</p>
<p>A witness who was near the Executive Mansion said the unidentified attackers overran a checkpoint at the entrance to the mansion, which is guarded by troops of the Nigerian-led ECOMOG West African peacekeeping force stationed in Liberia.</p>
<p>The cause of the firing was not clear but ECOMOG troops moved in with tanks and quickly deployed across the city's commercial district.</p>
<p>Witnesses said chief warlord Charles Taylor, who started Liberia's civil war in 1989 but is now on the ruling council, was about to drive into the mansion when shooting started.</p>
<p>Witnesses said firing later died down but many residents of the capital were standing outdoors trying to see what would happen next.</p>
<p>Seven weeks of militia fighting in April and May was accompanied by heavy looting that devastated the capital. That fighting was mainly between Taylor's forces and ULIMO-J guerrillas of Krahn warlord General Roosevelt Johnson.</p>
<p>ECOMOG has just started a new deployment hoping to begin disarming guerrillas under terms of the latest regional accord to end the civil war.</p>
