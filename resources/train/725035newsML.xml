<p>Poland's government will seek to amend this year's budget to allow more central bank financing and foreign borrowing in an effort to overcome flood damage, Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Floods have hit swathes of south Poland, damaging homes, roads, bridges, factories and farms. Officials said 2,400 sq km were still under water and more communities were threatened even though rains have largely abated.</p>
<p>&quot;We will approach the government for certain changes in the budget law, consisting of allowing the government to incur greater financial obligations including international ones,&quot; Cimoszewicz told reporters after a crisis cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The government has already used up this year's limit for sales of T-bills to the central bank, set at two percent of planned expenditures or roughly 2.5 billion zlotys ($751 million).</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said a higher ceiling would give the government greater flexibility in spending in the crucial coming weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We will ask for an increase in the limit for sales of government securities to the NBP (National Bank of Poland) ...and if we received such a permit this week the situation would be easier in coming days,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Sejm, parliament's lower house, decided to return from recess for a special session on Wednesday to review the government's proposals and the overall flood situation.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz declined to say by how much the government wanted to increase the limit.</p>
<p>Asked about a possible increase in foreign borrowing, Cimoszewicz said its size would depend on first assessments of the total damage done by the floods.</p>
<p>But he said Poland would soon start talks with the World Bank following its offer of special loans for reconstruction.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an offer from the World Bank to start negotiations on loans for reconstruction of the damaged areas and these negotiations will start soon, but the sums involved will depend on estimates of the scope of the damage,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether, aside from a higher limit for foreign loans, the government would also seek an increase in the limit for international bond issues.</p>
<p>This year's ceiling was set at $500 million and the government, which issued a $400 million yankee bond last month, has so far signalled it would not issue more bonds this year.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said that, among other financial measures, the government would make contributions to flood relief bodies tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Earlier Finance Minister Marek Belka said a special tax for flood-affected areas could be considered but Cimoszewicz said that this could be examined only after estimates of total costs of reconstruction were known.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said borrowing from the nation was also being considered. He did not say exactly how this might be done but he favoured voluntary rather than compulsory forms of financing aid to the flood victims and reconstruction of afflicted areas.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Leszek Miller on Saturday estimated that the government reconstruction plan for the affected regions would cost around $1 billion. Last week the cabinet earmarked around $200 million from various sources for the effort. ($ = 3.329 Polish Zlotys)</p>
