<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Thursday won from Japan an aid pledge and its promise to seek ways to assist Middle East peace before cutting short a visit to attend an emergency meeting of Arab states.</p>
<p>At a news conference after meeting Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Arafat blamed Israel for the standstill in the Middle East peace process, and repeated his call for the international community, particularly Japan, to push the process forward.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not asking for the moon. We're only asking for an implementation of an international agreement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hashimoto told Arafat in an afternoon meeting that Japan would consider what it could do to help bring peace to the Middle East, and pledged to extend $3 million in emergency aid to help improve infrastructure in Gaza, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official told reporters.</p>
<p>The aid would be disbursed through the U.N. Development Programme, the official said.</p>
<p>Japan extended the same amount to the Palestinians in the last fiscal year, which ended in March.</p>
<p>Arafat arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for what was orginally supposed to be a four-day visit to seek support for his peace efforts in the Middle East.</p>
<p>He was leaving on Thursday evening to attend an emergency meeting in Cairo of Arab foreign ministers, which was called to seek a united stand on recent developments in Arab-Israeli relations.</p>
<p>Arafat had urged the meeting to implement resolutions adopted at a Cairo Arab summit in June.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministerial conference is to follow up the resolution of the Arab Summit Conference, especially the implementation of agreements between the Palestinians and Israelis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arafat had a landmark meeting and handshake with new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week.</p>
<p>The meeting marked Netanyahu's formal acceptance of Arafat as a negotiating partner three years after the Palestinian president sealed a peace deal with an historic handshake with Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn.</p>
<p>&quot;I met Netanyahu to push forward the peace process, but I'm sorry to say everything is frozen,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Israelis must not miss this historical chance for Middle East peace, otherwise the reaction will be very, very negative,&quot; Arafat said. &quot;And patience has limits.&quot;</p>
<p>The Palestinians want implementation of the 1993 Oslo agreement on an Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron and other areas of the West Bank, and the opening of a passage for Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>Israel has stressed that self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank cannot go ahead unless its security needs are satisfied.</p>
<p>Arafat said the Palestinians were paying for peace with some of his people on the verge of starvation, as Israel's refusal to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and West Bank was strangling the Palestinian economy.</p>
<p>&quot;If you're speaking about security, how are you going to get security when the neighbour is starving?&quot; Arafat said. &quot;We're not neighbours only, we're overlapping neighbours and everything happening here will affect there.&quot;</p>
