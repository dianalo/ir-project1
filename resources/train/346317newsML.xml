<text>
<p>WANGANUI, Jan 31 - England lost seven wickets for 77 runs in 28.2 overs on the second morning of their four-day cricket match against New Zealand A at Victoria Park on Friday.</p>
<p>Resuming at 30 for three, in reply to New Zealand A's first innings 181, England were unable to cope with a lively pitch and some excellent fast-medium bowling from Heath Davis and Geoff Allott.</p>
<p>The final wicket fell at 107, giving New Zealand A a 74-run first innings lead.  </p>
<p>There was time for one over in the New Zealand A second innings, Darrin Murray playing out a maiden from Chris Silverwood.</p>
<p>Davis produced a dynamic performance this morning, taking three wickets for 12 in seven overs, to finish with four for 22, while Allott took the first and last wickets of the morning session to end with four for 44.</p>
<p>The only England batsman to offer much resistance was allrounder Ronnie Irani.  </p>
<p>In his first innings of the New Zealand tour, Irani hit a breezy 40, including seven fours, off 65 balls to put some substance into an otherwise highly unimpressive England display.</p>
<p>Off-spinner Paul Wiseman picked up two wickets late in the innings to finish with two for 13 off eight overs and Phil Chandler grabbed the last two catches to end with four for the innings.</p>
<p>With New Zealand's second test team to be named tomorrow night, both Allott and Davis gave watching chairman of selectors Ross Dykes plenty to ponder.</p>
