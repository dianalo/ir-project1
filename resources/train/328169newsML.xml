<p>Three major Italian coffee roasters, Luigi Lavazza SpA, Segafredo Zanetti SpA and Illycaffe SpA, said they had no immediate plans to raise retail prices.</p>
<p>An Illycaffe spokesman said the company did not foresee an increase in retail prices for the whole of 1997, while spokesmen for the other two companies said that while no increase was planned they would be watching the situation very closely.</p>
<p>German coffee roaster Eduscho GmbH &amp; Co KG said earlier on Thursday it would raise its retail prices of one its mild coffees by one mark per 500 grammes to 7.99 marks from February 3, due to a surge in futures prices and the strong dollar.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Turin-based Lavazza, which he said had 44 percent of total sales on the Italian market, said there had been strong tension recently in arabica prices and the dollar had firmed against the lira.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be watching what happens over the next few days but for the moment we do not plan an increase in prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Segafredo of Bologna said raw coffee prices, mainly robusta, had risen over the last couple of days on the London market. &quot;It is a bit too early to say but for the moment no rise in retail prices is planned,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Segafredo was the leading supplier in Italy to the hotel, bar, restaurant and catering trade, while its market share of the Italian mass market was some five percent. Segafredo uses a mix of arabica and robusta.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Trieste-based Illycaffe said &quot;we do not forecast increasing our retail price list for all 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>Illycaffe used only 100 percent arabica.</p>
<p>He said Illycaffe's share of the whole domestic roasted coffee market was 1.3 percent by quantity and some 3.0 percent by turnover, while its share of the espresso segment of the market was about 10 percent by volume and some 20 percent in terms of turnover.</p>
