<p>Asian stocks ended the year mixed or lower on Tuesday in thin trading marked by profit-taking and window-dressing, dealers said.</p>
<p>Half-day sessions were held in Hong Kong and Singapore while many markets were closed for the holidays.</p>
<p>Hong Kong shares fell on profit-taking and a dip on Wall Street on Monday. They clawed part of the way back from sharp losses in early trading.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index finished 29.30 points lower at 13,451.45, after recovering from a 116-point drop at the open. Turnover was a healthy HK$5.46 billion, in line with Monday morning's HK$5.63 billion.</p>
<p>Normal trading will resume on January 2.</p>
<p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11.54 points to 6,549.37, pushed down by program selling late in the session on Monday.</p>
<p>Singapore shares ended mixed on scattered year-end buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some window-dressing which pushed up certain stocks. But the volumes were so thin, there was hardly any activity,&quot; said a dealer with a local bank.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrials Index ended 1.66 points down at 2,216.79 while the SES All-share index was up 3.48 points at 536.12.</p>
<p>The Singapore market will be closed on Wednesday for the New Year and on Thursday for Singapore's general elections.</p>
<p>Shares opened lower in Delhi in thin early trade on profit-taking, brokers said. The bourse's benchmark index quoted 3.55 points lower at 698.60 after 30 minutes of trade.</p>
<p>In Bombay, blue chips started on a mixed note in the absence of any major market-moving factors, dealers said. ICICI rose 2.75 rupees to 63.50 rupees in volumes of 134,600 shares while SCICI was down 0.15 rupees to 27.0 with over 50,000 shares traded.</p>
<p>February Brent on SIMEX was offered at $23.80 per barrel with no bid, unchanged from midday levels. London rose 27 cents on Monday to close at $23.69.</p>
<p>Gold in Hong Kong was trading at US$369.20/70 vs a New York close of US$369.25/75.</p>
<p>At 0815 GMT the dollar was trading at 116.20/6.30 yen and 1.5549/56 marks.</p>
