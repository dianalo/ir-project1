<title>SWITZERLAND: UNHCR has no confirmation of Zaire killings.</title>

<p>The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on Thursday it had no confirmation of eyewitness accounts of mass killings in eastern Zaire, as reported by Belgium.</p>
<p>Belgian Development and Cooperation Minister Reginald Moreels told Het Laatste Nieuws newspaper at the weekend he had received eyewitness reports that a new &quot;genocide&quot; was under way in East Zaire and that mass graves had been found.</p>
<p>UNHCR spokesman Fernando del Mundo said his agency had no independent confirmation of the reported killings in the region, where movements of U.N. staff have been restricted by the war.</p>
<p>Del Mundo said a Zairean agency, Equilibre, reported it found 6,800 bodies of Rwandan Hutus and Zaireans during a six to eight week period after the fall of the border town of Goma late last year to Tutsi-led rebels, but UNHCR could not confirm this.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no information about these killings. Our people in Goma haven't found large-scale massacres. It would be difficult to hide huge massacres of thousands of people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday that Belgium's ambassadors in the region were checking the reports.</p>
<p>In Paris, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said: &quot;We've heard of these reports. They seem to be credible.</p>
<p>&quot;If the facts reported in the localities mentioned really happened, it would be necessary to find out if these acts, which can only prompt indignation and condemnation, happened across Zaire as a whole and were committed deliberately.&quot;</p>
<p>The conflict between rebels and Zairean troops escalated this month with the bombing of rebel-held towns. It has sent tens of thousands of refugees fleeing and threatens to destabilise vast Zaire and its central African neighbours.</p>
