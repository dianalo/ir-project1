<p>William Cox III, a member of the family that controls Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., has resigned from his job at the media company, a Dow Jones spokesman said Friday.</p>
<p>Most recently, Cox was managing Dow Jones' global stock indexes, spokesman Sanford Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Dow Jones, which supplies business news and information and publishes the Wall Street Journal, received a letter from Cox saying he was leaving the company, where he had worked for 18 years, Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Jacobs said he could not divulge reasons given by Cox for his departure.</p>
<p>Cox and a cousin, Elisabeth Goth, have made headlines in recent weeks over their stated disappointment with the New York-based company's direction and the value of its stock.</p>
<p>Other family members, including Cox's father, have said they support Dow Jones management.</p>
<p>Dow Jones' stock took a hit in late January after the company reported it would spend $650 million to expand and revitalise its Telerate financial information services unit. On the day of that announcement, the company's stock fell $4.50 to $36.375.</p>
<p>Dow Jones stock rose 37.5 cents to $39.625 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.</p>
<p>Cox, 41, whose father William Cox Jr. is on the board of directors, said he resigned from the company for a variety of reasons, but still plans to pursue efforts to make Dow Jones &quot;There's a lot of value at Dow Jones, but I think it has to be unlocked,&quot; Cox said in an interview. He said he had not &quot;deviated at all&quot; from his quest to increase shareholder value at Dow Jones.</p>
<p>But he said the overriding reasons he decided to leave the company are &quot;personal,&quot; as well as financial, maintaining he could make three times as much elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got a lot of offers,&quot; Cox said, declining to name his options.</p>
<p>Cox said he gave two weeks' notice. His last day is Feb. 21 at Dow Jones.</p>
