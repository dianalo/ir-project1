<p>A previously undisclosed incident aboard the damaged Russian space station Mir has given rise to new concerns about the risky spacewalk planned to restore its power.</p>
<p>Cosmonauts Tuesday reported hearing thumps and seeing something leaking overboard from a damaged module on Mir.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very concerned about what was in that module, what might have ruptured, and what the impact might be on the suited crew members,&quot; veteran astronaut Frank Culbertson, who runs NASA's missions to Mir, told a news conference on Saturday, referring to potential danger to astronauts wearing spacesuits while making repairs on the damaged module.</p>
<p>The space station crew reported hearing thumps from inside the Spektr science module that lost pressure and had to be sealed off after a cargo craft ploughed into it on June 25.</p>
<p>The incident went unreported by NASA until it was raised by Reuters at the news conference Saturday. It was originally monitored by radio from the Netherlands by Chris Berg, a Dutch space expert.</p>
<p>&quot;We heard some dull claps or knocks,&quot; Mir commander Vasily Tsibliev told the Russian mission control, according to Berg. &quot;We saw a big cloud of very little white flakes near (Spektr).&quot;</p>
<p>Tsibliev then asked flight controllers to check if fuel was leaking from the station. The following day, Mir flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin said there had been no further signs of venting from the damaged module, according to Berg.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NASA officials asked by Reuters about the incident said they knew nothing about it.</p>
<p>In Moscow, a senior official at Mission Control confirmed on  Saturday there had been a mystery leak from the Spektr science module five days ago and said experts were sure it was not fuel.</p>
<p>&quot;Only one thing is clear -- it was not fuel,&quot; a senior communications specialist told Reuters on condition he not be identified. &quot;But apart from that no one has an answer yet to this mystery.&quot;</p>
<p>Indentify the source of the leak may prove difficult, he said. &quot;We do not have any information on the situation inside the Spektr module.&quot;</p>
<p>Tsibliev and Lazutkin plan to enter the crippled module in their space suits as early as July 17 or 18 to reconnect electrical cables and restore some power lost after the crash. NASA's Mir resident, Michael Foale, is to sit out the repair inside the station's emergency escape ship.</p>
<p>There are concerns the cosmonauts could get toxic materials on their spacesuits during the repair. NASA and Russian space officials were trying to determine what dangerous materials might be present inside Spektr, which has been exposed to a vacuum since the crash.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got a few days to continue working on that,&quot; Culbertson said. &quot;We want to make sure we get a really good answer.&quot;</p>
<p>The white flakes seen escaping from Mir on Tuesday may have been caused by something bursting inside the module and leaking through the station's ruptured hull or could have come from a damaged radiator on the exterior of the module, he said.</p>
<p>Engineers were trying to determine if the leaking substances could be dangerous to a visiting space shuttle, according to an internal NASA document obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>The document speculated the leak could be polymethyl silicone coolant or ammonia from a punctured cooling loop.</p>
