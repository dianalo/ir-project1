<p>IBM South Africa Group Ltd said on Tuesday that it expected to make a profit in the second half of its financial year but that it did not expect to fully recoup its first half losses.  </p>
<p>&quot;...the group expects to trade profitably during the second half of the year to end December, but does not expect to recoup in full the losses incurred during the first six month,&quot; IBM's managing director Sal Faso said.</p>
<p>In line with a profit warning issued in April IBM reported a 64.2 million rand loss for the six months to end June 1997, compared to an operating profit of 62.7 million for the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Faso said, however, the firm remained tied to IBM's global strategy with the focus on services such as networking, outsourcing, systems integration, software and hardware solutions which could see it through its current woes.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain confident in this global strategy based upon strong local customer relationships, demand for IBM technology, intellectual capital, continued solutions development and support in South Africa,&quot; he said in a statement accompanying IBM's interim results.</p>
<p>The loss included a charge of 45.9 million rand incurred to maintain a competitive cost structure in the firm and was also due to lower turnover, a reduction in gross margins and the restructuring, Faso added.</p>
<p>IBM's earnings per share were shrouded in loss at 42.6 cents versus 32.3 profit in the same period last year. No dividend was declared.</p>
