<p>New York-listed shipping group Global Ocean Carriers Ltd said that its $125 million issue of senior notes will be priced today (Thursday).</p>
<p>Speaking at a London investors' roadshow Global Ocean executive vice president Michael Jolliffe said the bond issue will be priced during the afternoon local time in New York.</p>
<p>The issue was increased to $125 million from $100 million overnight, Jolliffe said, after the company decided not to enter into a $50 million secured credit facility at the same time. The 10-year notes will be due 2007.</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service has upgraded its rating of the offer to B2 from B3 as a result of the changes, and Jolliffe said he had been told that Standard &amp; Poors would also be upgrading its rating, to B plus from B.</p>
<p>Around $55 million of the funds raised by the issue will be used to pay for four additional ships and $61.5 million to pay off existing debts.</p>
<p>Jolliffe said Global Ocean was still hoping to carve out a secured facility of up to $20 million which it would not use immediately but might call on in the next six to nine months.</p>
