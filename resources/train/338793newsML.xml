<p>Dade Coutny, Fla., could see an $80 million cash reserve carryover suplus for fiscal year 1996, which ended Sept 30, county officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>A combination of increased property tax revenues and increased property tax values as well a reduced spending in some areas contributed to the projected surplus, said Alex Penelas, Metroplitan Dade County executive mayor, in an interview with Reuters here.</p>
<p>The final tally will be known when the county makes its mid-year budget adjustment for fiscal 1997 in the next few weeks, Penelas said.  </p>
<p>Penelas, elected to the newly created position Oct 1,  is in New York City to meet with the media, tourism groups, bond raters and investors to discuss Dade County's new government structure as well as Miami's fiscal problems.</p>
<p>The county has sold almost $600 million in debt in recent months, including a $437 million water and sewer bond issue. The county debt is rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc and A-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>Penelas noted that while Miami is an integral part of Dade County, its fiscal problems have not adversely affected the county's overall financial stability.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge facing Dade County is the welfare program and how to deal with about 40,000 people coming off the welfare rolls as federal reforms begin to take effect, Penelas said.</p>
