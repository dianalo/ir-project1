<p>Shares of expressway developer and operator Shenzhen Expressway Co Ltd bucked weak market sentiment to end up 26.14 percent on their trading debut.</p>
<p>The stock finished at HK$2.775, a rise of HK$0.575 from an issue price of HK$2.20.</p>
<p>&quot;Its performance was above our expectation,&quot; said Alex Tang, reseach director at Yamaichi International.</p>
<p>The shares, which topped the list of most actively traded stocks by turnover, moved in a range of HK$2.65 to HK$3.375. Volume was 340.86 million shares worth HK$1.03 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong fundamentals, good growth potential and a big 24 to 25 percent discount to NAV (net asset value) had made it a success in subscription response and on debut,&quot; Tang said.</p>
<p>NAV was estimated at about HK$2.80 per share, analysts said.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Expressway issued 650 million H-shares at HK$2.20 per share in flotation. Ten percent of the issue was offered to the public in Hong Kong and was 36.68 times subscribed.</p>
<p>The remaining 90 percent was offered to professional and institutional investors.</p>
<p>Analysts said the strong trading debut of the recent new listings, especially after Shum Yip Investment Ltd's sharp rally on debut, aided sentiment.  </p>
<p>Shares of the Shenzhen-municipal government backed Shum Yip soared 144.6 percent on their market debut on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts said Shenzhen Expressway and Shum Yip were similar to each other because they both had strong support from their Shenzhen parents and shared the same concept of tapping the economic growth in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Strong demand for Shenzhen Expressway shares clogged trade in the stock in the early session.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading did slow down a bit (on the stock) because of the heavy transactions but it did not jam up the system,&quot; said a spokeswoman from the Hong Kong stock exchange, adding that the exchange had not received any complaints from its members.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Expressway operates and manages two class one highways and has a 55 percent stake in two co-operative expressway joint ventures in Shenzhen, neighbouring Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;The shares were fairly valued at the current level,&quot; said Ben Kwong, director of research from Dharmala Securities. &quot;However, the shares are seen having longer term upside potential in view of its future prospects.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts said the strong debut of the stock would help improve sentiment towards the overall H-share sector and arouse investor interests in other upcoming new listings.</p>
