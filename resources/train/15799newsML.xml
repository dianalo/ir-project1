<headline>Toro posts record third-quarter results.</headline>

<p>The Toro Co., maker of lawn mowers and other outdoor maintenance products, Tuesday reported record third-quarter results, boosted by a strong finish to the quarter and snowthrower shipments.</p>
<p>Net earnings rose 62.5 percent to $6.5 million, or 52 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 2, from $4.0 million, or 32 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenues rose 14.8 percent to $232.6 million from $202.6 million.</p>
<p>Toro said its consumer product sales rose 33.9 percent during the quarter, led by extremely early sales of snow throwers and good performances from Toro's riding and electric product groups.</p>
<p>A spokesman said snow throwers are usually shipped in the fourth quarter, but dealers wanted to have them available in August because of overwhelming demand over the past winter.</p>
<p>Commercial product sales increased by 3.0 percent over the same period last year. International sales were strong and the domestic landscape contractor market continued to grow.</p>
<p>Irrigation sales grew 3.7 percent, as Toro's strategy of selling do-it-yourself products through mass merchants continued to be successful. Sales to golf courses and residential contractors also rose.</p>
<p>International sales increased by 15.5 percent due primarily to improving commercial sales to the European golf market. Sales of consumer products also grew.</p>
<p>Toro's stock fell 50 cents to $31.50 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday.</p>
