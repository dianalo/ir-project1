<title>RUSSIA: Mir commander trusts to training, plastic rabbit.</title>

<p>The wife of Mir commander Vasily Tsibliyev is trusting to her husband's intensive training to get him home from the stricken Russian space station -- and if that doesn't work he can always turn to his plastic rabbit.</p>
<p>&quot;It may not be pretty, but it's always worked,&quot; Larisa Tsibliyeva told Kommersant-Daily newspaper on Friday, describing a plastic good luck charm their daughter gave her father.</p>
<p>More importantly, she said, years of dangerous preparation for just such emergencies and training --ranging from parachute drops to survival at sea and in the desert -- had all given the 43-year-old space veteran the means to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;The job looks tough, but they'll do all they can,&quot; she said. &quot;They prepare for such situations, and they prepare well.&quot;</p>
<p>In a short interview from her home near Moscow, Tsibliyeva said she had been telephoned by a doctor at nearby Mission Control soon after the collision on Wednesday, which damaged Mir's electric power supply and holed one of its modules.</p>
<p>She had not been to Mission Control herself and had yet to speak to her husband since communications time was taken up by experts on the ground. She expected to talk at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll try to find some words of support and instil confidence that everything will be all right, although I think they are sure of that themselves,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev, Russian flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin, 39, and British-born American physicist Michael Foale, 40, face a bleak wait of nearly two weeks for a new freighter bringing supplies they need to repair the world's only orbital station.</p>
<p>Experts say the crippled Mir will face a tricky task in docking with the new arrival, and at least one of the cosmonauts will have to walk in space to repair the damage.</p>
<p>Ex-air force pilot Tsibliyev, who has been on Mir with Lazutkin since February, has made five space walks since his first, 197-day space flight four years ago.</p>
<p>His wife said the 10-day delay in launching the cargo craft, which before the accident had been due to start a routine mission on Friday, meant she thought her husband's return, planned for the end of August, could be put back by two weeks.</p>
<p>Foale's wife Ronda was out of touch on holiday, Tsibliyeva said, but she had spoken to Lazutkin's wife.</p>
<p>&quot;We said we wished, of course, this incident in orbit hadn't happened,&quot; she said. &quot;But given that something has happened, everyone's just got to get themselves out of it and find a way out of this situation.&quot;</p>
