<text>
<p>MGE spring wheat futures were firm throughout the session and settled higher on scale-down commercial pricing, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said wheat also gained after the release of the USDA's export inspections report, which showed export inspections of 14.3 million bushels of wheat during the week ended Jan. 16. That was above the 12.1 million bushels reported during the previous week.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat closed 3-1/2 to 5-3/4 cents per bushel higher, with March up 5-3/4 cents at $3.86. May gained five cents to close at $3.71.</p>
<p>Traders reported seeing a lack of hedge-related selling, which helped the market stay firm.</p>
<p>Benson-Quinn was the featured player in Minneapolis, buying one million March bushels on the spread with CBOT wheat. Atwood/Peavey bought 700,000 each of May and March. Atwood/Peavey also bull-spread 700,000 March/May at 15 cents.</p>
<p>MGE barley futures did not trade and settled unchanged.</p>
