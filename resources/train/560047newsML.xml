<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares started the week in good form on Monday, pushing through levels last seen in early March to return to record territory amid sparse trade.</p>
<p>The AEX index of leading shares ended up 8.00 points, or 1.04 percent, at a new closing record of 779.57, after a late squeeze had pushed the index to hit a new all-time high of 779.62 just ahead of the finish.</p>
<p>A firm local bond market, thin volumes due to extended local holidays, healthy, mainly retail, buying interest and strong blue chips had combined to propel the Dutch market to new heights, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Wall Street's rally on Friday had lifted Dutch shares in its wake early on and the extra push through major resistance at 779.00 is seen clearing the way for further healthy gains in the week ahead if sentiment in the U.S. stays positive.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the break clearly targeted the 800 level in the short term, though this might be contingent on the Dow beating its own record top at 7112.10.</p>
<p>Index major Royal Dutch recovered from the disappointment prevailing after flat first-quarter results on Thursday, moving up 5.50 guilders to 350.00, not far off its year-high set in February, as investors returned to the stock.  </p>
<p>Brewer Heineken also prospered, booking an 8.50 guilder gain to end at 341.80. Chemicals group Akzo-Nobel which has taken a pasting, losing 3.44 percent, in the last week found some bounce to end up 4.30 guilders at 257.30.</p>
<p>Technology stocks continued a hot run ignited on Friday, with software favourite Baan picking up 2.30 guilders to end at a new year-high of 108.50. The stock stood at just over 60 guilders in January.</p>
<p>Computer chip equipment maker ASM Lithography was a standout in the midcaps. An upgrade from Lehman Brothers was cited for a rise of 5.20 guilders to 161.70.  </p>
<p>Window blind maker Hunter Douglas powered to a new high at 171.90, rising 4.40 guilders. Copier firm Oce-van der Grinten was another beneficiary of the high-tech rally, gaining 4.90 guilders to 243.60 guilders. --Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
