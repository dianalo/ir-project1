<p>Algeria's government-appointed Transitional National Council on Tuesday approved a law that bans political parties from having a political platform based on Islam, the official Algerian news agency APS said.</p>
<p>The bill, accepted by the quasi-parliament in a special session called by President Liamine Zeroual, is an attempt to realign the political field after 1992 elections were cancelled when an Islamic party took the lead.</p>
<p>Since then some 60,000 people have died in violence between Moslem rebels and government forces.</p>
<p>Many Algerians blame the current bloody struggle over power on a previous law that allowed the radical Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) to enter politics.</p>
<p>That law ushered in the start of Algeria's democratic experiment in 1989, allowing more than 60 political parties from various shades to compete for power. The now-banned FIS did well enough to lead the 1992 national elections.</p>
<p>The new political party law also stipulates that every party should have a certain amount of supporters in at least 25 provinces among the country's 48 provinces. Some politicians say this will mean the end of many parties.</p>
<p>The law gives two legal Islamist parties, Nahda and Hamas, two months to change their manifestos to avoid running afoul of the legislation, political sources said.</p>
