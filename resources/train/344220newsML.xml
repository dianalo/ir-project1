<p>Israel's withdrawal from parts of the West Bank improved the human rights situation there last year, but both Israeli and Palestinian authorities committed &quot;serious abuses&quot;, a U.S. report said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The redeployment of the (Israeli army) from most major Palestinian population areas in the West Bank in December 1995 ... significantly reduced&quot; problems in the occupied areas, the State Department said in its annual rights report.</p>
<p>But the report, covering every country except the United States, said both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, or PA, which took control in areas vacated by Israel, &quot;were responsible for serious human rights abuses&quot; in 1996.</p>
<p>The survey said there were &quot;credible reports that Israeli authorities continue to abuse and torture Palestinian detainees and prisoners&quot; and that an Israeli undercover unit killed a Palestinian, compared with 10 such deaths in 1995.</p>
<p>But it said there were also credible reports that the PA &quot;continues to abuse and torture detainees&quot;, four of whom had died in its custody last year.</p>
<p>Israeli prison conditions were &quot;poor&quot;, while Palestinian prison conditions were &quot;very poor&quot;, it said.</p>
<p>The U.S. report also took issue with PA violations of freedom of speech. The authority, it said, &quot;continued to harass, detain and abuse journalists and political activists who criticised the PA.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning to violence-torn Algeria, the State Department found that the Algiers government's human rights performance &quot;improved somewhat&quot; but that there were &quot;continued serious human rights abuses&quot;.</p>
<p>Security forces carried out &quot;extrajudicial killings&quot;, were responsible for numerous disappearances, routinely tortured detainees and arbitrarily arrested many people suspected of involvement with with armed Islamist groups, it said.</p>
<p>But opposition groups, which have been conducting a widespread insurgency since elections were cancelled in 1992, also committed numerous serious abuses, killing thousands of civilians, it said.</p>
<p>The report again excoriated the &quot;rogue regimes&quot; in the Middle East that are on the State Department's list of states that support terrorism.</p>
<p>Iraq's Ba'athist government &quot;exercises absolute dictatorial authority&quot;, while &quot;repressive regimes in Iran, Syria and Libya are responsible for the systematic denial of their citizens' basic human rights,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The report saw no sign of significant improvement in Iran, with abuses including &quot;extrajudicial killings&quot; and summary executions, disappearances and widespread torture. Tehran's ruling clerics also effectively controlled elections, it said.</p>
<p>Washington's alliance with Saudi Arabia did not prevent sharp criticism of the kingdom's human rights practices. The Saudi government, it said, &quot;commits and tolerates serious human rights abuses&quot;.</p>
<p>In a brief reference to a truck-bomb explosion that killed 19 U.S. servicemen near Dhahran last June 25, the report said Saudi authorities had &quot;arrested dozens of people&quot; but that the investigation was continuing at year's end.</p>
<p>The report said that after a five-month period without executions in Saudi Arabia they resumed March 15. By year's end the authorities had beheaded 66 men and three women for offences ranging from murder to witchcraft. In a reversal of previous years, the majority were Saudis.</p>
