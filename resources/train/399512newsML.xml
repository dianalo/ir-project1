<headline>Du Pont jury enters sixth day of deliberations.</headline>

<p>After a day's rest, jurors in the John du Pont murder trial began their sixth day of deliberations on Monday, searching for consensus on a verdict.</p>
<p>The jury, which is confronted with eight possible verdicts in the case, was approaching their task with a new batch of visual aids they requested shortly before quitting on Saturday and taking Sunday off.</p>
<p>The six men and six women on the jury were given note pads, markers, easel board and tape to help them in their deliberations.</p>
<p>Du Pont, a millionaire chemicals heir, is charged with first and third-degree murder as well as voluntary manslaughter in the Jan. 26, 1996 killing of Olympic champion wrestler David Schultz.</p>
<p>Du Pont's lawyers have conceded du Pont killed Schultz, but are seeking a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>
<p>In addition to verdicts of not guilty or not guilty by reason of insanity, the jurors can render verdicts of guilty or guilty but mentally ill.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Court of Common Pleas Judge Patricia Jenkins told jurors she could see they were having trouble reaching a verdict and hoped they were not confused by the legal issues in the case.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly you have had this case for many hours over several days. You are having, or are apparently having, some difficulty resolving some of the issues in the case,&quot; Jenkins said.</p>
<p>She said the difficulty was positive in that it reflected seriousness on the part of the jury.</p>
