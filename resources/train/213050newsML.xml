<p>Qatar has signed an agreement with Andersen Consulting to assist in setting up an official stock exchange in the oil and gas-rich Gulf state, a senior government official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of the solution (with Anderson) will take place in two phases over the next two years and will see the delivery of a turnkey solution&quot;, said Yousef Hussein Kamal, undersecretary at the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;This includes the development of a regulatory framework, the establishment of procedures for Doha Securities Market (DSM) services, the creation of a DSM organisational structure as well as the delivery of hardware and software,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Currently shares of 18 companies are traded through a bank and some private brokers by telephone on an unofficial stock market. The market capitalisation of the companies exceeds $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>The Qatari government has announced that its official stock exchange would start functioning in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Kamal said the new package signed with Andersen Consulting Middle East, a unit of the U.S.-based firm, would enable the DSM to develop key services in trading, settlement, clearing, registration, surveillance and information dissemination.</p>
<p>Kamal said the exchange would initially only be partly electronic. But in the second phase, to be completed by the second half of 1998, it would be fully electronic.</p>
<p>Only Qatari nationals would be allowed to participate in the trading initially. Later, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nationals and finally foreigners might also allowed to trade, he said. The GCC groups Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain.</p>
<p>The exchange would also trade in government bonds and treasury bills, which the authorities may issue in the future to make up for budget deficits -- projected at around $550 million in 1996-97.</p>
<p>Andersen Consulting, a global management consultancy, has helped set up stock exchanges in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Jordan.</p>
