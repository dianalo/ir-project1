<p>A committee set up by India's market regulator, the Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has recommended an easier carry-forward trading system, the capital market watchdog said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The group has recommended abolition of twin-track system of segregating carry-forward trades and delivery trades, the elimination of a limit of 90 days for transactions and a 100-million-rupee limit on funding by financiers.  </p>
<p>The group headed by J.R. Verma in a statement released at a news conference Tuesday said a uniform 10 percent margin on gross positions with daily marking to market should be applied to both carry-forward and delivery trades and margin payments must be valued dated the same day.</p>
<p>The recommendations made by the group should be adopted only when stock exchanges have a well designed software for margin computation and well establised governance strucuture, it said.</p>
<p>In addition, exchanges should maintain administrative infrastructure for monitoring and enforcing the margining system.</p>
<p>O.P. Gehrotra, senior executive director at SEBI said the market regulator is likely to meet in early August and discuss on the recommendations of the committee.</p>
<p>The Verma group has said it recommended elimination of overall limts, sub-limits on puchase and sale and scrip wise limits on carry forward transactions and overall transactions.</p>
<p>The SEBI release said R.H. Patil, managing director of the National Stock Exchange, did not agree with some recommendations and had given a note of dissent.</p>
<p>Patil has argued in favour of twin trrack trading system among other things, the release added.</p>
