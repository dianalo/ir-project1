<title>THAILAND: Bank of Thailand says no baht band widening.</title>
<headline>Bank of Thailand says no baht band widening.</headline>

<p>The Bank of Thailand on Friday dismissed rumours the central bank was planning to widen its dollar/baht trading band as &quot;utter nonsense&quot;.</p>
<p>Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, the central bank's division chief in charge of money and foreign exchange markets, told Reuters the Bank of Thailand had no plan to change the exchange rate mechanism.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumours about any change in the exchange rate mechanism, including band-widening, are utter nonsense,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The baht was trading on the weak side on Thursday, precipitated by rumours that Thai authorities might be holding a meeting on the currency which could lead to a widening of the band, market sources said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand's head of Banking Department Bandid Nijathavorn also said that the present trading band will not be changed.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to categorically deny that rumour and reiterate that the present trading band of plus and minus two satangs is to remain firmly in place,&quot; Bandid told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are monitoring the baht market closely and will take necessary action to stabilise the external value of the baht,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The baht is fixed against three major currencies in a trade-weighed basket dominated by the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand fixes a dollar/baht mid-rate on a daily basis. It buys the dollar two satangs below and sells two satangs above the mid-rate through commercial banks.</p>
<p>Analysts said Thailand's fixed currency and floating money market interest rates make baht susceptible to speculative market attacks, especially when the country faces a bearish economic outlook.</p>
<p>Thai authorities have said they are satisfied that the economy is respoding to monetary and fiscal measures.</p>
<p>They said inflation has been kept under control, current account deficit is narrowing and data from the customs department show signs of export recovery.</p>
