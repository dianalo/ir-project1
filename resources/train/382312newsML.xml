<p>King Hussein of Jordan began a two-day visit to Germany on Monday, focusing on bilateral relations and the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the king at the Bonn chancellery, declaring him &quot;a true friend of our country&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The chancellor emphasised that the German government together with its partners in the European Union would do everything possible to support the peace process,&quot; government spokesman Peter Hausmann said after the meeting.</p>
<p>King Hussein also met Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger, who assured him of continued German support for development projects in Jordan.</p>
<p>Spranger also praised the king's personal contribution to Middle East peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The persistence and political intelligence of the Jordanian monarch is decisively important for further progress in the peace process,&quot; Spranger said.</p>
<p>King Hussein was also due to meet Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Karl-Heinz Hornhues, chairman of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee.</p>
<p>Government officials said there was no formal agenda for the talks but they were expected to include prospects for the peace process and German-Jordanian ties, described by one official as &quot;largely problem-free&quot;.</p>
