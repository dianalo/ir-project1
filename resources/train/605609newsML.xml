<p>Although NYMEX white metals futures fell Thursday, dealers were surprised by sharply higher platinum lease rates.</p>
<p>And they became more concerned about June palladium futures whose first notice day comes next week amid high open interest, tight physical market and low exchange stocks, according to dealers and traders.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, officials of Almazjuvelirexport, Russia's platinum group metals export agency, said 1997 exports will start at the end of May or in early June.</p>
<p>Shipments for the year will be in line with 1996 volumes despite the late start, the officials said.</p>
<p>This dampened upward momentum, and prices fell back by Thursday.</p>
<p>Although the Russian promises should be music to the bears' ears, the physical squeeze appeared to tighten Thursday as platinum lease rates, the cost of borrowing metal, leapt three percentage points to 11 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no metal around right now, and whether things will change once the Russians make their first shipment, I don't know,&quot; a white metals dealer said. &quot;It will take them a little while. Just one shipment is not going to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>A trader added, &quot;It's extremely abnormal to have lease rates of this magnitude. Possession of physical metal is highly valuable at this moment.&quot;</p>
<p>One view is that a good parcel of business was concluded Thursday morning which, in a tight market, was enough to make the offer price become the new bid price level, pushing up the spread in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as someone does something, they immediately adjust the lease rates. They just don't want to be caught,&quot; one dealer said, likening the situation to a past bull run in rhodium.</p>
<p>Other dealers thought lease rates suddenly surged because players were now prepared to gamble on borrowing metal, albeit at a higher cost, and hope prices fall as Russia delivers.</p>
<p>&quot;People who don't want to buy at these prices have been emboldened by Almaz statements and have gone out to borrow rather than buying, and since there is no metal there, you have to bid the price up,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in palladium, first notice day for the NYMEX June contract is June 1, with expiry on June 25. Open interest at the close of trade Wednesday was 4,659 lots at 100 ounces each, or 465,900 ounces.</p>
<p>NYMEX palladium stocks Wednesday were just 591 ounces.</p>
<p>One floor source expected prices to spike from next week with June hitting $200 an ounce as players scrambled to close positions or rollover.</p>
<p>Others said the tight market in palladium has been flagged for some time, and few by now would leave themselves open to such an obvious trap.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on how many people stood on the sidelines and did not believe what was happening,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;Next week will probably be like a real nightmare as far as the switches.&quot;</p>
<p>However, any players caught short may avoid closing out June positions.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been a lot of calls lately for EFPs, and swap locations, and switches on the floor, and not that much on just outright quotes or looking to buy or sell the metal,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
