<p>THE HERALD</p>
<p>- President Robert Mugabe has warned non-performing members of parliament that the electorate could easily throw them out as it wants serious representation in parliament.</p>
<p>- A doctor who conducted a post-mortem on a child who died after an operation performed last year by former cabinet minister Felix Muchemwa, said the baby developed gangrene resulting from an intestine sutured to the abdominal wall. Muchemwa has been charged with culpable homicide.</p>
<p>- The Grain Marketing Board, which has come under heavy criticism from farming organisations for retaining last year's floor price for maize, has so far bought 20,000 tonnes of the grain and 3,500 tonnes of groundnuts from farmers.</p>
