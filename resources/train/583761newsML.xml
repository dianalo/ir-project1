<title>USA: Blue-chip stocks surge on unexpectedly good inflation data.</title>
<headline>Blue-chip stocks surge on unexpectedly good inflation data.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks surged Wednesday after surprisingly good news on inflation at the wholesale level last month seemed to reduce the odds that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again next week.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. EDT 1400 GMT, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 63.87 points at 7,338.08.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues swamped declines by a 3-1 margin on active trading of 80 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Labour Department reported that the Producer Price Index fell 0.6 percent in April -- the biggest drop in nearly four years. Excluding food and energy, the index was down 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>It was the fourth straight month that producer prices have fallen and followed a 0.1 percent decline in March.</p>
<p>The figures were lower than expected, leading to speculation that the Federal Open Market Committee would leave interest rates unchanged at Tuesday's meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very favourable number to the bonds and of course bonds are gatekeepers to the stocks,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond jumped 22/32, lowering its yield to 6.87 percent from Tuesday's 6.93 percent. The bond's price and yield move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed appears on an economic and political hotspot,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist for Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;Inflation numbers remain relatively benign. Any Fed rate hike may cause some damage to both market and business psychologies.&quot;</p>
<p>Pierre Ellis, senior economist, Primark Decision Economics, said the numbers are &quot;very favourable. It's a relief. There is absolutely no sign of inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>There has been speculation as recently as Tuesday that the Fed would raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee raised the fed funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans, by a quarter percentage point to 5.50 percent in March in an effort to ward off inflation.</p>
<p>The last increase in interest rates set the stage for a selloff that wiped nearly 700 points from the blue-chip Dow index before the market mounted a strong recovery to set a record close of 7,292.75 on Monday.</p>
