<title>USA: Boston convention center closer to reality.</title>

<p>The bid to build a new convention center in Boston moved a step closer to reality Wednesday after economic development projects important to other parts of the state were attached to it.</p>
<p>The State Administration Committee approved Gov. William Weld's May proposal calling for construction of a $700 million convention center and exhibition hall on Summer Street in South Boston. But as State House News Service reported melded into that measure is the $62 million Weld had requested in a capital outlay bill to bolster similar projects in Springfield, Worcester, Lenox and Fall River.</p>
<p>And the bill swelled even more after the Senate committee chairman on Tuesday won an amendment to assure that an added $30 million would be available for economic development and tourism in the &quot;Greater Southeastern part of Massachusetts.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to the convention center deemed key to the economy of both the city and the region, the bill also calls for capital expenditures of $25 million for the planned overhaul and expansion of the National Basketball of Fame in Springfield, $14 million to rehabilitate the Springfield Civic Center; $17 million to expand convention space in Worcester; $2.5 million for a planned national music center in Lenox; and $3.5 million for a industrial park development in Fall River.</p>
<p>The measure moves now to the House Long-Term Debt and Capital Expenditure Committee, which plans to act on it later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It will then wend its way to the House Ways and Means Committee before debate begins in the full House.  Speaker Thomas Finneran has predicted it will win House passage before a planned summer recess later this month.</p>
<p>Questions over how the Boston project will be financed have stalled it in recent years, but top city and state officials appear to have reached a tentative agreement on how much each of them, and the businesses that will benefit from the complex, will pay to support it.</p>
