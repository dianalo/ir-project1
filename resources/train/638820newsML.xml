<title>NETHERLANDS: Unisource partners to merge international networks.</title>
<headline>Unisource partners to merge international networks.</headline>
<dateline>HOOFDDORP, Netherlands 1997-06-04</dateline>

<p>Unisource, the Euroepean telecoms joint venture between Dutch PTT, Telia of Sweden and Swiss Telecom PTT said on Wednesday its partners had agreed to merge their international networks.  </p>
<p>&quot;The shareholders, (Dutch PTT unit) PTT Telecom, Telia and Swiss Telecom have agreed in principle to the merger of their respective international networks,&quot; a Unisource spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is to create economies of scale and to be more competitive in the European market. Our other partners, such as AT&amp;T Corp, can also benefit,&quot; she added.  </p>
<p>A statement from Unisource said the international carrier units would be merged into Unisource Carrier Services (UCS) as of January 1, 1998.</p>
<p>It said the merger would create Europe's leading international carrier with initial revenues of $2.0 billion and around 900 employees based around Europe.</p>
<p>UCS will be part of Unisource and have its headquarters in Wallisellen/Zurich in Switzerland, the statement said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are creating a multi-billion (dollar) company which further expands our presence in Europe and puts us in a leading position in the global telecommunications wholesale market,&quot; Unisource president Paul Smits said in the statement.</p>
<p>Unisource said the deal created Europe's most extensive centrally managed pan-European carrier. &quot;It is foreseen that the pan-European network could eventually be linked to AT&amp;T's network...creating a truly global network,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Unisource owns 60 percent and AT&amp;T 40 percent of their business telecoms venture, AT&amp;T-Unisource.  </p>
<p>In April the Unisource partners asked fourth member Telefonica of Spain to leave the group after news it had forged an incompatible link with Concert, a rival business telecoms alliance between British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp.</p>
<p>Unisource has timed completion of the merger to coincide with the European Union's date for liberalisation of European telecommunications services.</p>
<p>&quot;By further strengthening our carrier business we are ideally positioned to take maximum advantage of the opportunities the liberalised...market will present,&quot; it said.</p>
