<p>Meanwhile, early cash prices at the Henry Hub, La., were talked steady at $2.19-2.22 per mmBtu.  </p>
<p>Chart traders pegged resistance in June at $2.33 and then at the $2.385 contract high. Support was seen at $2.17, then at $2.05 and along the up trendline at $2.03.</p>
<p>In Monday's cash market, Gulf Coast prices firmed a couple of cents to near $2.20. Midcon pipes were steady to down slightly around $2. New York city gate gas was slightly firmer in the mid-to-high $2.40s.</p>
