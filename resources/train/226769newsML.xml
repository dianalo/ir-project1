<p>The United Nations official in charge of destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction on Saturday said he had secured financial and political support from all six Gulf Arab states for his mission.</p>
<p>&quot;We received, without exception, the political support we are looking for and the necessary assurances on the financial aspects,&quot; Rolf Ekeus told reporters in Bahrain, field headquarters of U.N. missions visiting Iraq.</p>
<p>He arrived in Bahrain from Qatar on Saturday at the end of a swing through Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman on a Gulf tour seeking financial support for his commission set up after the 1991 Gulf War to end Iraq's mass destruction capabilities.</p>
<p>Ekeus said he informed Gulf Arab states of his commission's work and the financial difficulties facing it.</p>
<p>A U.N. official travelling with Ekeus said on Saturday Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had promised to pay $3 million each in 1997 towards the commission. Ekeus declined to confirm the figure.</p>
<p>The official said the mission would need between $28-$30 million in 1997 to cover the cost of its operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>Ekeus praised Iraq's acceptance this week of U.N. terms for an oil-for-food deal, expressing hope that Baghdad would move to solve other issues obstructing the easing or lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The deal will allow Iraq to sell $2 billion of oil in a six-month period to buy badly-needed food and medicine. The U.N. Security Council's sanctions committee on Wednesday accepted an oil pricing formula necessary for the agreement to be implemented.</p>
<p>Elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction under Gulf War ceasefire terms is a prerequisite to the lifting of the crippling sanctions.</p>
<p>Ekeus said he would visit Baghdad on December 8 for talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit will last longer than normal,&quot; he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>&quot;Our job...is to lift (Iraq's) embargo. The commission is not deciding to keep the sanction. It's the Security Council alone,&quot; Ekeus said in reply to a question about criticism in the Arab press that he was prolonging the embargo.</p>
