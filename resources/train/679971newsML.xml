<p>New blizzards forced Chilean rescuers on Monday to suspend efforts to rescue about 200 people trapped by heavy snow since Thursday.</p>
<p>With roads blocked by 18 feet (six metres) of snow, the 200 travelers were holed up in a customs office and nearby buildings at Los Libertadores pass on the Argentine border with adequate food and heating but no word on when can leave.</p>
<p>Air force rescuers brought about 30 people, mostly women and children, out by helicopter on Sunday but abandoned operations when snowstorms resumed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile floods forced thousands of people out of their homes near Chile's capital, Santiago.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a tremendous snowstorm in the mountains. No helicopter in the world could fly through it,&quot; an air force officer said. Wind was gusting at 44 mph (70 kph) and visibility was near zero, making it unlikely rescue efforts could resume on Monday at the pass, the main land route between Argentina and Chile, a National Emergency Office spokesman said.</p>
<p>The travelers were heading through the narrow pass in trucks, cars and buses on Thursday when the blizzard hit, forcing most of them to stop at the customs building. Others were trapped in the Cristo Redentor tunnel under the border or at a ski resort a few miles down the road.</p>
<p>They had food to last until at least the middle of the week, the spokesman said. The customs building was well-heated but has few comforts.</p>
<p>Torrential rains and strong winds have been buffeting central Chile since Thursday, dumping massive snowfalls at high elevations, flooding towns and forcing about 45,000 people to leave their homes, most of them in Santiago's low-lying western outskirts.</p>
<p>&quot;We're facing a weather front that is extraordinarily tough ... and we will need special efforts to overcome its effects,&quot; said President Eduardo Frei, who visited flood victims in the Santiago suburb of Lampa on Sunday.</p>
<p>The town of Maipu, one of the worst-hit areas, was under up to three feet (one meter) of water after nearby rivers burst their banks but most people refused to leave their houses for fear of looting, residents said.</p>
<p>At least 17 deaths have been blamed on floods since early June. Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos said the floods had done about $70 million in damage to highways and bridges.</p>
<p>Local news reports have linked the bad weather to El Nino, a cyclical, warm current in the Pacific Ocean that has been linked this year to unusually hot weather in Peru and strange weather patterns elsewhere.</p>
