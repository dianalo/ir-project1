<headline>Serbs to go ahead with postponed local poll--aide.</headline>

<p>Bosnian Serbs said on Tuesday they will go ahead with municipal elections on September 14 despite a decision by the OSCE to postpone them over alleged irregularities in Serb voter registrations.</p>
<p>Serb deputy prime minister Miroslav Vjestica was quoted by the separatists' news agency SRNA as saying: &quot;The government of the Bosnian Serb republic will, in keeping with a decision by the national assembly, hold full elections -- meaning also municipal - as envisaged by the rules of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.&quot;  </p>
<p>SRNA termed OSCE ambassador Robert Frowick's decision to postpone the poll as &quot;undemocratic&quot;. It said the OSCE's Provisional Election Commission (PEC) -- its top rule-making body for the elections -- had been split 4-3 over whether to defer the municipal ballot.</p>
<p>International election monitors have charged that authorities actively pressured Bosnian Serb refugees in Serbia to register to vote from towns which once had Moslem majorities but are now underpopulated because the Moslems were killed or expelled during the war.</p>
<p>Frowick, the OSCE head in charge of the elections, said earlier in the day voting for cantonal assemblies, separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments, a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency would go forward on September 14 as planned.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Bosnian Serb) government has firmly decided to hold integral elections and in this respect has already issued orders to municipal election commissions,&quot; SRNA said.</p>
