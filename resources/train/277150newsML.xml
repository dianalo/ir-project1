<p>A renegade white rhinoceros, one of the world's most endangered species, was killed on Thursday after it escaped from a private zoo and charged one of the men trying to capture it.</p>
<p>The rampaging 5,000-pound (2,250-kilos) female was shot by the zoo veternarian as it charged within 15 feet (4.6 metres) of him, said Casey Lamb, general curator of the Baton Rouge, Louisiana zoo who was called in to try to tranquillise the animal.</p>
<p>Lamb told Reuters he was attempting to shoot the rhino with a tranquilliser gun, but was unable to do so because the animal was running through an area covered with thick brush.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very close to getting a clear shot. But at the last minute, the rhino bolted and went right toward my back-up, who had the kill rifle ... he had no alternative but to shoot to protect his own life,&quot; Lamb said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just like being in Africa,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lamb said there were thought to be less than 2,000 white rhinoceroses left in the world. &quot;The numbers have been dwindling so fast it's hard to keep accurate numbers. They're mainly endangered due to poaching for the rhino horn, which is used for an Oriental medicine,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just one of the most depressing days of my life. It's one of those instances where if you could possibly turn back the hands of time ...,&quot; Lamb said.</p>
<p>The animal was being kept at the Zoo of Acadiana, located in Broussard, a suburb of Lafayette, Louisiana, about 115 miles (184 km) west of New Orleans.</p>
<p>Lamb said the zoo also has a male white rhinoceros, which did not escape.</p>
