<p>The European Commission looked set on Wedneday to block the proposed merger between Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas to create the world's dominant aerospace and defence company, raising the prospect of a damaging transatlantic dispute.</p>
<p>EU sources said they were not expecting an 11th hour compromise prior to the Commission's next weekly meeting on July 23 when it is due to take a final decision on the deal.</p>
<p>Boeing also appeared to stick to its guns by refusing to make any further concessions despite a clear warning by the Commission on Tuesday that it would not allow the merger to proceed unless this happened.</p>
<p>&quot;We have negotiated in good faith. We have taken very seriously each of the Commission's concerns and have made a sincere effort to put forward substantial remedies in each of the areas,&quot; Boeing's vice-president for European affairs, Jim Frank, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent stand-off, industry representatives and lawyers well versed in EU competition law still look with disbelief at the prospect of a ban.</p>
<p>Boeing shares have been little moved in recent days by the talks and ended at $58 on Tuesday, close to their year high. &quot;Nobody completely believes it will be blocked,&quot; one lawyer said.</p>
<p>He and others admitted that although the deal may be prohibited by the EU next Wednesday, under European rules which ban creation or strengthening of dominant positions in the 15-nation bloc, Boeing may refile its plans at a later stage with appropriate amendments.</p>
<p>A source close to the negotiations said this seemed like a &quot;reasonable scenario&quot;.</p>
<p>Although the deal has been cleared without conditions in the United States, it must also get regulatory approval in the EU because of the amount of business Boeing does in the bloc.</p>
<p>Were Boeing to ignore a ruling against it, the Commission could fine it up to 10 percent of its turnover and fine any European companies doing business with the U.S. aviation giant.</p>
<p>Commission sources said the EU could also seize any new planes being delivered in Europe.</p>
<p>The current stalemate between the EU and Boeing raises the spectre of a bitter transatlantic dispute.</p>
<p>German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Wednesday the concessions offered by Boeing did not go far enough, adding that the key competition concerns had not been fully addressed.</p>
<p>&quot;The decisive things are the terms of exclusive contracts and the spill-over of military technology (into civilian areas -- that is clearly not enough,&quot; Rexrodt told a news conference.</p>
<p>But U.S. Vice President Al Gore has also warned that the Clinton administration would take any appropriate action to prevent the Commission from torpedoing the merger.</p>
<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has sharply criticised the merger ever since it was announced in December. He says long-term exclusive supply pacts signed between the U.S. giant and large airlines AMR Corp's American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines are unacceptable.</p>
<p>Boeing recently proposed reducing the contracts to &quot;slightly more than 10 years&quot; as opposed to 20 years and to allow the airlines concerned to buy from other suppliers if offered a better price, an EU source said.</p>
<p>But the Commission judged the contracts were still too long and thought it was unlikely the airlines would find better deals given the price rebates offered by Boeing in return for becoming sole supplier.</p>
<p>On the issue of the &quot;spill-over&quot; of defence funds to commercial airplane programmes, Boeing's chairman and chief executive officer Phil Condit said in May the dispute had been solved in an EU-U.S. 1992 agreement on aircraft subsidies.</p>
<p>But European governments and the aerospace industry have asked for further discussions, arguing that the United States is not respecting the accord.</p>
<p>EU sources said Boeing had addressed only one EU competition concern involving intellectual property rights. The Commission had expressed fears that the absorption of McDonnell Douglas would give Boeing a &quot;gigantic&quot; portfolio of patents.</p>
<p>Given the little progress achieved, the meeting for the second time this month of a committee of competition experts from the 15 EU states, which advises the Commission in merger decisions, was seen as a formality.</p>
<p>&quot;We will explain to them that the proposals we received were unsufficient,&quot; one EU source said.</p>
<p>The same committee agreed unanimously with the Commission on July 4 that the deal should be blocked in its current form.</p>
