<p>A U.S. Air Force intelligence officer, accused of trying to kill his wife with a mail bomb so he could join his Romanian mistress, was found dead in his jail cell on Thursday, officials said.</p>
<p>Air Force Maj. Lester Keith Haney, 44, died in an apparent suicide just four days before his trial on federal charges stemming from the alleged murder attempt.</p>
<p>Trial proceedings had been scheduled to get under way on Monday. But Haney's lawyer, public defender Dick Young, said the defendant reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors and was preparing to enter a guilty plea.</p>
<p>Haney, a highly decorated military officer with top security clearance, was accused of sending his wife Patty a mail bomb that left her with cuts to the face, arms and hands when it exploded on Sept. 15, 1995. Federal officials claimed Haney wanted to murder his wife so he could pursue a love affair with a Romananian woman who he met while stationed in Bucharest in 1993.</p>
<p>Haney maintained that his liaison with the woman had been ordered by U.S. intelligence services and denied that she had ever been his lover, but investigators found 13 love letters addressed to the woman on his home computer. Also discovered in a search of his home were components for a bomb similar to the one that injured his wife.</p>
