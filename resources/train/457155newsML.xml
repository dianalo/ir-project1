<title>UK: UK MPs recommend possible curbs on BT/MCI.</title>
<headline>UK MPs recommend possible curbs on BT/MCI.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's telecommunications regulator should consider requiring British Telecommunications Plc, if its merger with MCI Communications Corp goes ahead, to dispose of MCI's nine percent stake in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd, parliament's trade and industry committee said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>BT is planning to merge with MCI to form Concert, creating the world's second largest telecommunications group.</p>
<p>MCI paid $1.35 billion in May 1995 for a nine percent stake in News Corp, which owns 40 percent of satellite broadcaster BSkyB Plc.</p>
<p>Under current British law, BT is barred from offering broadcast entertainment services over its telephone lines, in order to encourage cable television companies to build their networks.</p>
<p>In a report on telecommunications regulation, the cross-party committee of members of parliament said that BT's indirect stake in BSkyB would give it an indirect link to media communications.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is important that OFTEL (the telecoms regulator) assesses how this relationship between BT and BSkyB is likely to affect the current prohibition on BT carrying entertainment services on its telecommunications network,&quot; the MPs said.</p>
<p>BT told the committee it would regard its stake in BSkyB as passive but would be interested in potential collaborations, particularly in the interactive market.</p>
<p>&quot;We recommend that the Director General examine the potential consequences, on the development of competition, of a closer relationship between BT and BSkyB and take appropriate action including, if necessary, requiring Concert to dispose of its interest in News Corporation or amending BT's licence conditions,&quot; the report said.  </p>
<p>The committee repeated a recommendation it made in 1994 that all broadcast enertainment restrictions on BT and other telephone companies, for example Mercury Communications, should be lifted completely by 2002.</p>
<p>It also urged an immediate announcement that the curbs would be removed at that time.</p>
<p>The Conservative government has said it does not intend to review the curbs until 2001, although OFTEL Director General Don Cruickshank plans to review them this year as part of a periodic examination of the competitiveness of the telecoms market.</p>
<p>&quot;We recommend the Director General's review and recommend that he publish his conclusions,&quot; the committee said.  </p>
<p>The MPs concluded from the evidence they took that the curbs had affected BT's investment plans, but not by as much as the firm envisaged in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;They nevertheless continue to create uncertainty for BT and affect its ability to invest in broadband services,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>BT told the committee in 1994 that it would cost 15 billion pounds over six to seven years to upgrade its network to provide broadband services, but that the curbs were holding it back.</p>
<p>Since then, it has invested a total of seven billion pounds, of which just 294 million went to support broadband services, the report said.  </p>
<p>On the proposed BT/MCI merger, the committee said it remained concerned about the consequences for British consumers and the level of future investment in the domestic market.</p>
<p>&quot;We recommend that the government should make a commitment to safeguarding the interests of UK consumers and should give appropriate policy direction to OFTEL to have regard to the level of future investment in the domestic market,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The committee also recommended that consideration be given to making regulatory decisions the responsibility of a small panel as in the United States, rather than one individual, in order to depersonalise decision-making.</p>
<p>It urged the government to commission an independent examination by world class consultants of Britain's methodology and approach to telephone numbering schemes to avoid constant changes that are disruptive, inconvenient and costly.</p>
<p>Finally, it said the government should undertake a review of the regulatory structures of telecoms and broadcasting within the next two years with a view to redefining roles and setting clear responsibilities in a rapidly changing market.</p>
