<headline>Italian shares close higher on back of BTPs.</headline>
<text>
<p>1620 GMT - Italian shares closed mostly firmer but below the day's highs on Thursday, spurred on by a firm lira and a stable BTP futures market, with most blue chip stocks posting healthy gains.</p>
<p>* The all-share mibtel index finished 1.34 percent higher at 12,064 with the blue chip mib30 up 1.45 percent at 17,871. Traders said investors took profits as soon as the mib30 approached the psycholically sensitive 18,000 level.</p>
<p>* One of the biggest gainers of the session was Stet, which closed 2.65 percent higher at 7,699 lire, lifted partly by reports -- later denied -- that the company is discussing a broad-ranging alliance with AT&amp;T.  </p>
<p>* Traders said they were reassured by remarks by EU Commissioner Thibault de Silguy that even countries failing to qualify for EMU in 1999 would have the chance of clambering on board to in time to introduce Euro notres and currency by 2002.</p>
<p>* In Bonn, Italian opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi said after meeting Chancellor Helmut Kohl that the timetable and criteria for European Monetary Union (EMU) would be adhered to.</p>
<p>* Banks, led by Ambroveneto, Mediobanca and BCI, posted gains while Sai retreated although other insurances advanced.</p>
