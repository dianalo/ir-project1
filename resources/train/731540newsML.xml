<p>Portuguese women Fernanda Ribeiro and Carla Sacramento were the most impressive winners in early action at the Nice grand prix on Wednesday when they both ran the fastest times of the year in the 3,000 metres and mile respectively.</p>
<p>Ribeiro, the Olympic 10,000 champion, proved she is coming into form at just the right time for next month's world championships in Athens by running a year's best of eight minutes 37.15 seconds to win the 3,000.</p>
<p>She was pushed all the way by Kenyan Sally Barsosio but typically timed her finish to perfection, hitting the front only 70 metres from the line.</p>
<p>Sacramento won a closely-fought mile race in 4:25.00, the best time of the year over the distance, to underline her credentials for a major title at Athens after going close several times in recent championships.</p>
<p>Jacinta Muraguri of Kenya finished second in 4:26.34 just ahead of Australian Margaret Crowley in 4:26.47.</p>
<p>South African teenager Llewellyn Herbert, who finished with a silver medal in the world junior championships last year, was another impressive early winner in the 400 metres hurdles.</p>
<p>He outpaced Zambia's Olympic silver medallist Samuel Matete over the last two hurdles to win in 48.17 seconds with Matete second in 48.37.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not overawed by the older athletes,&quot; he said afterwards. &quot;If you're good enough to win, it doesn't matter how old you are.&quot;</p>
<p>European champion Geir Moen of Norway finished his preparations for Athens with a win in the 200 metres, but had to find some extra speed in the last 30 metres to overtake 19-year-old Seun Ogunkoya of Nigeria.</p>
<p>The African 100 champion led from the start but wilted over the last few strides.</p>
<p>&quot;I am really tired now after running a lot recently,&quot; Moen said. &quot;I have to be ready for the worlds. It's going to be tough. Ato Boldon is in great shape so is Frankie Fredericks and Maurice Greene -- and Michael Johnson hasn't even started running yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Moen clocked 20.41, with American Rohsaan Griffin second in 20.50, the same time as Ogunkoya, who was placed third.</p>
<p>Other winners included American Kim Batten in the 400 metres hurdles (53.71), Astrid Kumbernuss in the women's shot (20.51 metres) and Sarka Kasparkova of the Czech Republic in the women's triple jump (14.72 metres).</p>
<p>Anier Garcia of Cuba, a newcomer in the men's 110 hurdles, pipped Britain's Tony Jarrett on the line to win in 13.18 seconds with Jarrett second in 13.20.</p>
