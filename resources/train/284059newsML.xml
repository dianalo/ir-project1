<p>A government drive to win back French voter confidence has had little impact on the popularity of French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe, a public opinion poll showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The SOFRES poll for the weekly Le Figaro magazine found that just 36 percent of French adults had confidence in Chirac's ability to resolve the problems facing the country, essentially unchanged from 37 percent the previous month.</p>
<p>Nearly two out of three adults lacked confidence in the head of state, the poll found.</p>
<p>Similarly, just 26 percent had confidence in Juppe in the latest survey, a minimal shift from the 25 percent who held that opinion in December.</p>
<p>Seventy-one percent lacked confidence in the prime minister while three percent had no opinion. Several recent surveys have found that a majority of French adults want Juppe sacked.</p>
<p>Voter opinion was virtually unmoved in the new poll despite a televised appeal by Chirac on December 12 for public understanding of unpopular government austerity policies, adopted to help France qualify for a single European currency from 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The French people no longer believe in speeches. They want action,&quot; Le Figaro magazine wrote.</p>
<p>It said that a record 12.7 percent unemployment was the voters' main worry, with 91 percent of those surveyed saying the government had not done enough to create new jobs.</p>
<p>The poll was based on interviews with 1,000 people aged 18 and over, conducted December 21-24.</p>
