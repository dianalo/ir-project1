<title>CANADA: Alberta Conservatives cruise to another majority.</title>
<headline>Alberta Conservatives cruise to another majority.</headline>
<dateline>CALGARY, Alberta 1997-03-11</dateline>

<p>Alberta Premier Ralph Klein's Progressive Conservative party cruised to its second majority in the Canadian province's general election on Tuesday, local television projected.</p>
<p>The Conservatives won 63 seats in the legislature in the wealthy, oil-rich province, surpassing their previous total of 54 seats, Alberta affiliates of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and CTV said.</p>
<p>The Liberal party under leader Grant Mitchell won 18 seats, while the left-leaning New Democrats, led by Pam Barrett, gained two after being shut out in the last election.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, which ran a campaign that emphasized their economic record and the regular-guy appeal of their pudgy, 54-year-old leader, also won in the popular vote category with 51 percent.</p>
<p>The Klein government, first elected in 1993 on a platform of fiscal restraint, chopped government spending by 20 percent amid an economic boom driven by a robust oil and gas sector, resulting in three consecutive provincial budget surpluses. A fourth is projected for 1997-98.</p>
<p>Klein, a former television reporter and popular Calgary mayor known for his love of beer, faced his only campaign hurdle in early March when Alberta's nurses union threatened an illegal strike after years of wage rollbacks and health-care spending cuts.</p>
<p>But provincial health authorities hammered out a deal just before the strike deadline last week, leaving Klein with clear sailing for his re-election bid.</p>
<p>Eight consecutive Conservative governments under three different leaders have been in power in the western Canadian province since 1971.</p>
