<p>Davis Love III</p>
<p>with a tap-in birdie on the second playoff hole, beat Phil</p>
<p>Mickelson to win the U.S. Championship leg of the World</p>
<p>Chamionship of golf on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Love's victory makes him the second regional champion</p>
<p>after Hajime Meshiai of Japan to qualify for the match play</p>
<p>tournament at the World Finals in January, 1998, in</p>
<p>Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>
<p>In a see-saw battle, neither player had more than a 1-up</p>
<p>lead throughout the match.</p>
<p>On the first playoff hole, the 457-yard 16th, Love and</p>
<p>Mickelson made lengthy par putts after aggressive first putts</p>
<p>at birdie rolled by the hole. At the 17th, Love staked a</p>
<p>7-iron to two feet to claim the title.</p>
<p>&quot;It was my best shot of the tournament,&quot; Love, 32, said.</p>
<p>&quot;The first time I misclubbed, and it helped me the second time</p>
<p>we played 17.</p>
<p>&quot;The match wasn't pretty, but it was nice to end with a</p>
<p>good shot,&quot; said Love, who won $200,000 for his victory to add</p>
<p>to the $70,000 he won by beating Lehman, 3-2, earlier in the</p>
<p>day and $20,000 for defeating Corey Pavin, 5-3, on Monday.</p>
<p>Mickelson won $150,000 as runnerup. He also won a total of</p>
<p>$90,000 for beating Fred Couples and Mark O'Meara in earlier</p>
<p>rounds.</p>
