<p>A full 90 percent of Colombians believe their country is in a state of crisis, according to a survey published on Saturday in Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper.</p>
<p>The poll, involving 7,450 participants in top cities nationwide, was commissioned by the ruling Liberal Party and carried out between June 9 and July 2 by Global Strategy Group Inc. of the United States. Its margin of error was 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>No comparative figures were given for the survey, but political analysts said it was believed to mark the first time such an overwhelming majority of Colombians described their country as in a state of crisis. Only six percent of participants said they thought the country was in something less than critical condition.</p>
<p>Unemployment was identified as the leading cause of Colombia's problems by 36 percent of those polled, while 25 percent said lawlessness and corruption were the top problems facing the country.</p>
<p>Only 19 percent pointed to leftist guerrilla groups as the top problem confronting Colombians.</p>
