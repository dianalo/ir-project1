<p>The Indian government recently bought 1.0 million tonnes of Australian wheat, bringing its combined purchases since December 1996 to nearly 2.7 million tonnes, and the government may buy more, according to a U.S. agricultural attache report released on Thursday.</p>
<p>The report, dated March 31, said the latest purchase was scheduled for shipment during the latter part of 1997.  </p>
<p>The State Trading Corp of India asked other companies to re-submit bids by early next week and may be interested in an additional 500,000 to 800,000 tonnes if prices are attractive, the report said. STC's initial import allocation was 2.0 million tonnes, but this has reportedly been revised to 3.5 million tonnes, leaving approval for additional purchases of about 800,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;While it was anticipated that wheat purchasing would halt during April and May to protect farm prices and give the government a chance to assess 1997 procurement, it appears the government has decided to move ahead with its 1997/98 purchase program,&quot; the attache report said.</p>
<p>India's latest wheat purchase was 250,000 tonnes for August, 250,000 tonnes for November, and 500,000 tonnes for December.</p>
<p>The report also said that India's rice exports were expected to fall to 1.3 million tonnes during 1997.</p>
<p>The reports are compiled by agricultural attaches at American embassies and are not official U.S. Agriculture Department data.</p>
