<p>Cash cattle prices moved $1.00 higher to $66.00 per cwt in U.S. feedlot markets Thursday and analysts said with feedlot offerings likely to decline into spring, prices should reach $70.00 to $71.00 in April.</p>
<p>Live cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange jumped to contract highs Thursday in the February and April contracts in fast trading on news of the $66.00 trades.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my belief we will take this market to $69.00 to $71.00 in the April period,&quot; said Andy Gottschalk, livestock analyst at LFG LLC.  </p>
<p>Gottschalk said in a bull market, which he believes is under way now, cattle prices rise first, followed by beef prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is, cash (cattle) prices are the drive and the product values tend to lag,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Beef prices have trended lower since mid-January but this week have recovered slightly. USDA reported beef cutout values for 700- to 850-lb choice carcasses at $96.51 per cwt late Wednesday versus $101.82 in mid-January.  </p>
<p>Feedlots are current in their marketings, evidenced by a steady decline in average cattle weights, said Gottschalk. USDA reported cattle slaughtered during the week ended February 15 averaged 1,163 lbs, down from 1,164 the previous week and 1,166 the week ended January 31 and well below 1,177 a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the driving force (in cattle prices) is we have seen the peak in marketings for the winter,&quot; said Doug Harper, senior livestock analyst with Brock Associates Inc.</p>
<p>Harper expects cash cattle prices to trade at $69.00 this spring, possibly reaching $70.00.  </p>
<p>Harper said falling pork prices could draw some demand away from beef. USDA reported cutout values for grade 1 pork carcasses at $68.81 per cwt Wednesday versus $74.48 a month earlier.</p>
<p>On the plus side for beef are exports, which Harper said &quot;are solid.&quot;</p>
<p>News of anthrax in some Australian cattle could aid U.S. beef exports if importing countries become concerned about the disease, said Harper. U.S. beef competes with Australian beef in the Japanese market.</p>
<p>South Korea's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on Thursday asked Australia to halt beef exports from areas hit by anthrax, but a Japan health official said Thursday Japan will continue to accept Australian beef.</p>
