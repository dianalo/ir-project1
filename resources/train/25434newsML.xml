<p>Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry will look into rumours in the financial markets that industrial output data, released on Friday, were leaked before the announcement, a MITI official said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the data were actually leaked, we will look into the matter and will take proper measures to prevent it from happening again,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Operators in Japan's bond markets said figures for July industrial production and forecasts for August and September output circulated in the markets about 10-15 minutes before the announcement of the data at 3.30 p.m. (0630 GMT).</p>
<p>The ministry announced industrial production in July rose 4.1 percent month-on-month, and also said output by major manufacturers is expected to fall 1.2 percent in August but rise 0.1 percent in September.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures in the markets were exactly the same as those that the ministry announced,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>But the MITI official said the ministry kept the information under tight control and he did not think a leak was possible.</p>
