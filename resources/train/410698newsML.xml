<headline>Italy's Prodi moves to clarify EMU Germany remarks.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Friday that he thought it was &quot;possible&quot; that Germany would seek a delay to the start of Europe's planned single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>But in a sign of the sensitivity surrounding the debate, he swiftly issued a clarification saying there was no assumption whatever that the timetable for economic and monetary union (EMU) would be put back.</p>
<p>Problems faced by almost all European states in reining in their budget deficits to bring them under the threshold laid down in the Maastricht Treaty has led many economists to increase the probability of a delay in the start of the single currency.</p>
<p>Prodi was asked in a pre-recorded Italian television show if he thought Germany, rather than Italy, could seek a delay.</p>
<p>&quot;That is their business. It is also possible. We must be ready...We cannot allow ourselves to ask for a delay,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also said a request for a delay would not be easy for Germany because Chancellor Helmut Kohl had staked his political life on pushing forward European integration.</p>
<p>The German Finance Ministry, asked about Prodi's remarks, said Bonn planned no change to the EMU timetable.</p>
<p>Prodi's spokesman Francesco Luna telephoned news agencies to say &quot;the Prime Minister excludes that there is any assumption of a delay to the timetable for a single European currency.&quot;</p>
<p>That position had been &quot;clearly expressed&quot; during a telephone conversation Prodi had with French President Jacques Chirac about EMU on Thursday, Luna said.</p>
<p>A decision on which countries will qualify for EMU founder membership will be made in early 1998 on the basis of their 1997 accounts. Countries must meet set targets on inflation, exchange rates, interest rates, deficits and public debt.</p>
<p>Talk of delay to the single currency has become rife in unofficial circles. One element has been that Germany's unemployment queues will stifle Bonn's ability to cut the country's deficit to qualify for EMU.</p>
<p>Italy's centre-left government has been ultra-sensitive at any suggestion that it might not qualify for the first wave of EMU, although economists doubt its chances of bringing its public sector deficit down to the required three percent of gross domestic product, from 6.8 percent last year.</p>
<p>Prodi repeated on Friday that a mini-budget he has said he will draw up next month would keep Italy to three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Given where we are now, at around 3.4 or 3.3 percent, we will get there with the new (supplementary) budget,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also again acknowledged German public mistrust of Italian EMU founder membership and Rome's ability to sustain the single currency criteria once inside the currency union.</p>
