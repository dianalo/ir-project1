<headline>Swedish Riksbank says inflation pressure fallen.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, said on Wednesday inflationary pressures appeared to have eased for various reasons.</p>
<p>But the central bank said in a quarterly newsletter it was still too early to say how inflation trends had changed.  </p>
<p>&quot;The inflationary pressure in the Swedish economy could have fallen for several reasons,&quot; the newsletter said.</p>
<p>The central banks said part of the drop may be because &quot;the confidence in anti-inflation measures could have increased.&quot;</p>
<p>It also said the defence of the crown in 1992, the Riksbank's inflation target of two percent with a one-percentage point leeway in either direction, its repo rate policies and Sweden's European Union membership and improved state finances may have contributed to easing inflation worries.</p>
<p>&quot;It is, however, too early to draw conclusions about how much inflationary pressure in the Swedish economy has decreased, apart from the effects of weak economic trends,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Sweden's June consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1 percent for a year-on-year rise of 0.8 percent. Since December 1996, CPI has risen 1.2 percent.</p>
