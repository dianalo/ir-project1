<p>China's trade deficit with Taiwan is mounting and an influx of labour-intensive industries from the island is affecting China's trade balance with other partners, a newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>China's trade deficit with Taiwan rose by 5.8 percent in the first six months of 1996 to $5.67 billion from the year-earlier period, the International Business Times said.</p>
<p>China's exports to Taiwan fell a year-on-year 15.8 percent to $1.28 billion between January and June, while imports from the island inched up 0.9 percent to $6.95 billion, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said exports slipped and import growth slowed due in part to tensions in March, when China conducted war games and missile tests off Taiwan in the run-up to the island's historic direct presidential elections.</p>
<p>Beijing and Taipei have been political rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, but China welcomes and encourages trade and investment with Taiwan.</p>
<p>China's exports to Taiwan accounted for two percent of the nation's total exports in the first half of this year. Imports from Taiwan were 11 percent of total imports.</p>
<p>Taiwan was China's sixth largest trading partner in the first six months, down from fifth place last year.</p>
<p>Last month, China stepped up pressure on Taiwan to lift a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links by unilaterally announcing a set of regulations to pave the way for such ties.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links since 1949. Indirect trade and investment have been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Many Taiwanese business executives, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.</p>
<p>The newspaper said China's imports from Taiwan consisted mainly of goods needed by foreign-funded enterprises or companies engaged in processing imported raw materials for re-export.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that labour-intensive industries from Taiwan which were exporting from China were affecting the nation's trade balance with the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Much of the benefit from such manufacturing went to Taiwan and not China, it added.</p>
<p>The newspaper said China's exports to Taiwan were expected to rebound in the second half of 1996 and that imports would grow at a faster pace than in the first half.</p>
