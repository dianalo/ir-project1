<p>Afghanistan's new militant Sunni Moslem Taleban rulers lashed out on Tuesday at criticism voiced by neighbouring Shi'ite Moslem Iran, Kabul radio said.</p>
<p>The Iranian charge d'affaires was summoned to the foreign ministry to receive a note from acting Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Ghous protesting at remarks by Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Taleban-controlled radio said.</p>
<p>The note urged Iran to avoid hostile statements, seen as interference in internal Afghan affairs, said the radio, monitored in the Pakistani capital Islamabad.</p>
<p>The Taleban wanted good relations with all Afghanistan's neighbours but would hold Iran responsible for any tension if such hostile statements continued, the radio added.</p>
<p>Khamenei blasted the Taleban as &quot;un-Islamic&quot; on Monday and said it enjoyed the backing of the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;In Iran's neighbourhood, unfortunately, un-Islamic and unacceptable deeds are done in the name of Islam by a group whose knowledge of Islam is questionable,&quot; Khamenei said.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the Taleban takeover of Kabul posed a national security concern for Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever happens in Afghanistan affects our national security. Therefore, we cannot remain indifferent towards it,&quot; he told the Iranian newspaper Ettelaat on Monday.</p>
<p>Iran has shown deep suspicion of the Taleban, whose arrival on the Afghan scene two years ago was denounced by Tehran's semi-official media as a U.S.-Pakistani-Saudi plot.</p>
<p>The United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have all denied giving any support to the Taleban, or religious students, who want to impose strict Islamic sharia law across Afghanistan.</p>
<p>After the Taleban capture of the western city of Herat and the killing of Shi'ite faction leader Ali Mazari while in Taleban captivity 13 months ago, Iran swung closer to the government of deposed president Burhanuddin Rabbani.</p>
<p>Iran provided sanctuary for Herat's ousted pro-Rabbani governor Ismail Khan and his followers, but denied Taleban accusations that it was helping him to build a force that would strike back at the Taleban from Iranian territory.</p>
<p>Iranian officials worked hard to forge an alliance between the Rabbani government and its foes, saying Afghanistan needed a broad-based government. The Taleban shunned all proposals for talks with Rabbani or his military chief Ahmad Shah Masood.</p>
