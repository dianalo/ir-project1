<p>The long end of the Australian bond market was in slightly more positive mood after being shrouded in gloom for the past week, helped in part by a firmer, albeit choppy, U.S. Treasury market.</p>
<p>Traders said that a late recovery locally on Wednesday extended into after hours trading, although prices had failed to to hold their top levels in line with a volatile U.S. market.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market is looking in better shape, but I suspect we are near the top of the day's range and we will probably consolidate from here. There is still caution in the market,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>The local market has been under intense pressure in the past week, largely reflecting continued weakness in U.S. Treasuries, and while there has been no real change in economic fundamentals, the technical outlook has been soured.</p>
<p>The 10-year bond futures contract, which has retreated from an all time high of 93.695 on August 1 to 93.135 at one stage on Wednesday, is now finding stiff resistance in breaking back above the low 93.300s.</p>
<p>Technical analysts expect the market will need to consolidate further before taking out 93.310 resistance and pushing ahead to 93.470.  </p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries rallied on Wednesday in response to a 0.1 percent fall in the July PP1, the seventh consecutive decline, and although retail sales showed a fairly solid 0.6 percent rise, it was below the 1.0 percent-plus the market had been fearing. The July U.S. CPI is due later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Locally, final average weekly wages data for the second quarter are due at 11.30 a.m. (0130 GMT).</p>
<p>Although some economists are expecting an upward revision to the 3.7 percent annual growth seen in the preliminary outcome, it is expected to remain close enough to 4.0 percent to not cause concern to the market.  </p>
