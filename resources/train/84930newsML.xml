<p>Most Colombians oppose lifting their country's constitutional ban on extradition -- cited in June as justification for not sending drug lords for trial in the United States -- a nationwide poll showed on Monday.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by the respected RCN radio news network, showed only 30 percent of Colombians approved of their fellow countrymen being tried in foreign lands.</p>
<p>Of 3,236 people interviewed on Monday, 1,982 or 61.2 percent said they opposed extradition, according to RCN.</p>
<p>Only 970, or 30 percent, said they supported the practice, the radio said.</p>
<p>No margin for error was given. But 284 people, or 8.8 percent of the total, either declined to respond or said they had no opinion.</p>
<p>Colombia denied a request in June from U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno for the extradition of four top drug lords, including brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela -- the billionaire chieftains of the Cali drug cartel.</p>
<p>In doing so, the government cited the constitutional ban that Colombia's Congress placed on extradition in 1991. But Washington signalled its anger shortly afterwards by stripping President Ernesto Samper of his U.S. travel visa.</p>
<p>Apart from nationalistic pride, political analysts say grassroots opposition to extradition is largely due to the campaign of bombings, assassinations and kidnappings that drug lords waged against the practice in the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
