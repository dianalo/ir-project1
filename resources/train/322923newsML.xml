<p>Police and paramilitary rangers patrolled main roads in Pakistan's biggest city Karachi on Tuesday as a strike called by a militant Sunni Moslem group hit commercial activity and public transport, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The patrols guarded commercial centres and mosques in the city, which is the country's main port, to prevent any outbreak of violence.</p>
<p>The strike was in response to the death of Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) group chief Zia-ur-Rahman Faruqi, who was among 26 people killed in a bomb attack outside a court on Saturday in the Punjab province capital, Lahore.</p>
<p>The blast, blamed by Sunni hardliners on Iran and the local Shi'ite Tehrik-i-Jafria Pakistan (TJP) group, has raised fears of sectarian unrest two weeks before Pakistan's February 3 general election.s</p>
<p>The TJP has condemned the blast, and its leader Sajid Ali Naqvi accused unspecified &quot;vested interests&quot; of conspiring to break down law and order to a point of no return.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that anti-state and anti-Pakistan elements have been assigned the task of creating chaos and instability by the vested interests,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There were no reports of violence or arson during Tuesday's strike in Karachi, but witnesses said public transport was thin and private vehicles avoided areas considered SSP strongholds.</p>
<p>Most shopping centres and wholesale markets were partly shut as some traders kept their shutters down for fear of violence.</p>
<p>The Karachi Stock Exchange opened for business, but later closed because of thin attendance, a bourse official said.</p>
<p>Bankers said most banks in the southern commercial district were open and the strike would not affect interbank trading.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike has only hit public transport. I think office attendance has not been affected as much as in previous strikes,&quot; said a foreign banker, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>On Sunday, SSP activists sacked and burned the Iranian cultural centre in Lahore, drawing a protest from Tehran.</p>
<p>&quot;What took place in Pakistan in recent days is the result of actions by America and the Zionist regime (Israel) which are provoking sectarianism,&quot; Iranian Radio quoted Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Boroujerdi as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;America's anti-Islamic move in Pakistan will in no way affect the level of ties between Iran and Pakistan,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>No group has claimed responsibility for the bomb blast, the latest incident in a long-running feud between militants in Pakistan's majority Sunni and minority Shi'ite communities, which cost about 170 lives last year.</p>
<p>Shi'ites form about 15 percent of Pakistan's population of over 130 million, but are a majority in neighbouring Iran.</p>
<p>Police said on Monday that a Shi'ite activist named Mehram Ali, 35, had confessed to detonating the bomb by remote control as Faruqi and his deputy, Azam Tariq, arrived at the Lahore court to face charges of being involved in sectarian murders.</p>
<p>Lahore's regional police chief, Deputy Inspector General Tariq Pervez, said Ali had told police his main target was Tariq because of his speeches attacking Shi'ite leaders.</p>
<p>Naqvi said Ali had no link with the TJP.</p>
