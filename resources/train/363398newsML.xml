<p>A privatization plan outlined by Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell on Friday would reduce from $505 million to $180 million the bond issue needed to fund improvements to the city's water and sewer system.</p>
<p>The city had planned to issue $505 million of revenue bonds over the next two years to finance badly needed improvements to the system, most of which is over 100 years old. Debt service on the bonds would have been paid by raising sewer rates 81 percent over four years.</p>
<p>But Campbell said Friday he was consulting with top engineering firms on a plan to convert the water and sewer system to private management. He said that would provide the city with &quot;significant financial savings from operations.&quot;</p>
<p>The savings will be used to finance the majority of the capital improvments needed to improve Atlanta's system without a dramatic increase in sewer and water rates,&quot; Campbell said.</p>
<p>The city still would issue $180 million of revenue bonds to finance work that must be completed by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;These improvements include projects mandated by state law which, if not competed this year, will result in significant financial penalties,&quot; Campbell said.</p>
<p>But the proposal would require a sewage rate hike of only 14 percent, or about $2.65 per month, for one year, Campbell said.</p>
<p>He said the initial rate proposal was &quot;onerous&quot; and would have hurt poor and elderly residents most.</p>
<p>&quot;I am also concerned that this increase will curtail economic development in our city, which has been at unprecedented levels in recent years,&quot; Campbell said.</p>
<p>The mayor said he would present the plan to the Atlanta City Council at a meeting Feb 17.</p>
<p>Atlanta already pays $7.2 million a year in state fines because its sewer system, which empties into the Chattahoochee River, does not meet anti-pollution standards. In addition to installing anti-pollution equipment, the city needs to replace nearly 3 million feet of aging water lines.</p>
<p>The change in plans became possible because the U.S. Treasury Department changed the tax rules last month to allow cities that issue tax-exempt debt to enter into management contracts for water and sewer operations for up to 20 years. Previously, the limit was five years.</p>
