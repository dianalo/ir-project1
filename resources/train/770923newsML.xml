<p>THE TIMES</p>
<p>- Prime Minister Alfred Sant tells Parliament that one of Malta's two leading banks had offered to buy Posta Ltd, the state-owned postal company which is being liquidated by the government. He did not reveal which bank had made the offer nor how much it was prepared to pay. A Bank of Valletta spokesman told the newspaper the bank knew nothing of the matter. Mid-Med Bank chairman Alfred Mifsud said he could neither confirm, nor deny the statement. The government has a majority stake in Mid-Med.</p>
<p>L-ORIZZONT</p>
<p>-  Man denies that his daughter had stabbed him, saying he accidentally walked into a knife she was holding. The 16-year-old girl is charged with attempting to kill her father.</p>
<p>IN-NAZZJON</p>
<p>- Malta's Auditor-General Joe G. Galea is sworn in, becoming the first auditor-general to be directly answerable to Parliament. Malta previously had a Director of Audit, answerable to the Minister of Finance, but under new legislation the Audit Office has become independent of the government.</p>
