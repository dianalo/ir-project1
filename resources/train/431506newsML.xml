<p>Britain appeared to be on track to meet its inflation target when official figures released Monday showed February producer prices rose at the slowest rate in over a decade.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics said factory prices rose 1.3 percent in the year to February, a rate last seen in August 1986. February prices were unchanged from January.</p>
<p>Core output prices, which strip out food, drink, tobacco and gasoline products, rose by just 0.5 percent in the year to February, a rate last seen in 1967.</p>
<p>The government cited the figures as proof its economic policies were working and described the data as &quot;outstanding.&quot;</p>
<p>Bank of England Governor Eddie George told reporters in Basel, Switzerland, where he was attending a meeting of central bankers, that underlying retail price inflation would hit the government's target of 2.5 percent later this year.</p>
<p>However, he cast doubt on whether inflation could stay at or below target. &quot;The question is not whether we will reach it, but maintain it.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists, who had forecast a small monthly rise in factory prices, said the target was now in sight and there was little need for an interest rate rise.</p>
<p>&quot;This is another set of excellent producer price inflation figures, suggesting that cost pressures in the economy remain remarkably subdued,&quot; said Andrew Cates, UK economist at UBS.</p>
<p>&quot;The government looks increasingly likely to hit its target by the middle of the year and there is little to suggest that monetary conditions need to be tightened at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Underlying annual inflation excluding mortgage interest payments was 3.1 percent in February.</p>
