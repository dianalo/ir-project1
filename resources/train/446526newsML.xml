<p>South African President Nelson Mandela met preacher Allan Boesak shortly after his return from the United States to face trial for the theft of anti-apartheid aid funds, a spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>The statement came amidst a storm of controversy about Justice Minister Dullah Omar's decision to welcome Boesak back on Sunday with a public hug and an airport rally by more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Omar said he was acting as provincial leader of Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) and on Mandela's specific instructions.</p>
<p>&quot;I have done my duty as minister of justice,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Boesak appeared briefly in the Cape Town magistrate's court on Monday and was told to return to the high court in August to face 21 charges of theft and nine of fraud totalling about 1.4 million rand ($315,000).</p>
<p>The charges were laid by the Scandinavian development agency DanChurch Aid while Boesak, a former leader of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, was head of the anti-apartheid Foundation for Peace and Justice.</p>
<p>Boesak said on Sunday he was &quot;totally innocent&quot; and told reporters on Monday he would plead not guilty to all charges.</p>
<p>Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela offered Boesak moral support in a meeting at his official residence on Sunday, telling him that getting up was more important in life than falling.</p>
<p>&quot;The president knows Allan Boesak at a personal level,&quot; he said. &quot;From a human point of view, it is easy to run away from a person when he is in trouble, but the president feels this is the time when someone needs support most.&quot;</p>
<p>Boesak headed the ANC's election campaign in the Western Cape, one of nine provinces, in 1994 and frequently appeared on platforms with Mandela.</p>
<p>Opposition parties castigated Omar for publicly backing Boesak ahead of his trial, which is expected to last at least eight months.</p>
<p>&quot;Has Mr Omar taken leave of his senses,&quot; said liberal Democratic party legislator Douglas Gibson. &quot;It is time to reassess Mr Omar's fitness as South Africa's minister of justice.&quot;</p>
<p>The white-led National Party, target of Boesak's tough fight against white rule in the 1980s, said it was disgusted by Omar's &quot;direct influencing of the legal process&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The National Party expects the minister of justice...to dissociate himself from personal appeals for solidarity against an accused,&quot; said NP legislator Patrick McKenzie.</p>
