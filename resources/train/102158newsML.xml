<title>CZECH REPUBLIC: Czech stock market in subdued mood as indices fall.</title>
<headline>Czech stock market in subdued mood as indices fall.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1996-10-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Czech PX50 index posted its sixth straight fall on Tuesday with turnover staying low and dealers seeing little chance of a revival in interest in Czech equities before the Senate elections in mid-November.</p>
<p>The PX50 lost 0.6 percent to 559.7 while the RPIX index of continuously traded shares fell 0.8 percent to 1,114.</p>
<p>Dealers said the malaise in the Czech equities market was typical of the region as a whole, although the current political situation in the Czech Republic was seen as adding further woes to an already subdued bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see anything really dramatic in the market changing things until the Senate elections,&quot; said Ivan Kusacek of Zivnostenska Banka.</p>
<p>Kusacek also said the current situation in the Czech parliament, in which the minority centre-right government is at the mercy of the opposition Social Democrats, was undoubtedly part of the reason for the lack of interest in the stock market.</p>
<p>On the Prague Stock Exchange itself major issues were once again at the forefront of the decline. All major issues except CEZ, which was unchanged, lost ground.</p>
