<p>Britain's Millwall Holdings Plc, the parent of London soccer club Milwall, is to call in administrators to run the business during an ongoing financial crisis, the Press Association news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Millwall's shares were suspended on the London stock exchange, pending clarification of its financial position.  </p>
<p>No official comment was immediately available from the club.</p>
<p>Millwall shares were earlier suspended at a price of 4p, which values the company at around 14.4 million pounds.</p>
<p>NatWest, Millwall's main bankers, said earlier they had been discussing the financial situation with the club.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand shares in Millwall Holdings Plc were suspended at 1045 GMT after discussions with their own financial advisers with whom we believe Millwall are still continuing their discussions,&quot; NatWest said. &quot;There has been previous dialogue with NatWest about Millwall's financial position and this will continue,&quot; the bank added in a statement.  </p>
<p>Millwall's financial results for the year to May 31, 1996 showed gross debt of some 10 million stg.</p>
<p>The company made a pre-tax loss of 2.9 million pounds in a year when the soccer team was relegated to the English second division after a dramatic late slump in form. Millwall are now among the leading clubs in the hunt for promotion.</p>
<p>Millwall sold a number of leading players to premier league clubs after its relegation and said squad members to the value of 2.45 million pounds were sold in the first six weeks of the current financial year.</p>
