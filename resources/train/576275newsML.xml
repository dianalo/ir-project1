<title>USA: CME feeder cattle end mostly up, set new highs.</title>
<headline>CME feeder cattle end mostly up, set new highs.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>CME feeder cattle futures surged to mostly higher closes after setting contract highs in all months but January. Live cattle ended slightly lower as commercial selling offset further fund buying, traders said.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle closed up 0.900 cent per lb to off 0.100 with August up 0.550 at 77.950 cents. Only January failed to post a new high with August setting a fresh high of 78.400 cents. Live cattle ended 0.050 to 0.250 cent lower with June off 0.050 at 66.050 cents. October set a new high of 69.625 and December a new high of 71.250 before slipping.</p>
<p>Strong demand in cash circles for feeder cattle and forecasts for a large U.S. corn crop and lower feed costs boosted feeder cattle futures to new highs, sources said.</p>
<p>USDA early Monday forecast this year's corn production at 9.840 million bushels, the second largest on record.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures responded by notching contract highs for the second straight day. August has set a new high in 12 of the past 15 days. Technical fund buying and demand from the strong cash market combined to lift prices, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;You're seeing extraordinary demand&quot; for feeders, said Steve Morgan, publisher of Commodity Review and Outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a market that is counting on higher prices down the road,&quot; Morgan added. The latest CME feeder cattle index rose $0.28 to $73.36 per cwt, highest level since February 16, 1995.  </p>
<p>Morgan also cited a break Monday in CBOT corn and soy complex futures which encouraging added buying interest in feeders. There also appeared to be buying of feeders in anticipation of Monday's crop production report, he noted.</p>
<p>Rosenthal Collins bought August while E.D.&amp;F. Man sold and LIT division of First Options spread long August/short May. Cargill Investor Services notably spread long December and February live cattle/short August feeders, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Fund buying again supported live cattle futures after Friday's rally, but persistent commercial hedging pushed prices down into the close, traders said.</p>
<p>The seasonal trend is for cash beef and fed cattle markets to ease as summer unfolds, mentality that kept a lid on the market. Wholesale boxed beef prices are already slipping and fed cattle supplies should increase in June, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The seasonals are all kicking in - and there is a projected increase in cattle numbers,&quot; Morgan said.</p>
<p>Analysts' expectations for Friday's monthly USDA Cattle-on-Feed report, although ranging widely, point to larger-than-year-ago on-feed supplies.</p>
<p>May 1 on-feed estimates gathered so far were ranging from 108.7 to 111 percent of a year earlier.</p>
<p>Placement estimates were ranging from 104.9 to 127.5 percent and marketings 98.6 to 104 percent.</p>
<p>RBH, R.J. O'Brien, Refco and Shatkin sold during the day while ABN Chicogo Corp, Prudential Securities, Smith Barney, E.D.&amp;F. Man, ING and Dean Witter bought. Refco spread long December/short August, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In live cattle options, commission houses sold June 66 calls and August 64 and 65 puts and bought December 72 and 74 calls. Commercials hedged, buying the October 64/66 put spread, pit sources added.</p>
