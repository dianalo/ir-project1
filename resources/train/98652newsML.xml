<p>Israel and the PLO, moving back from the brink, agreed at a U.S.-mediated meeting to hold intensive talks on how to implement a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said after a three-hour session on Sunday, their first since 58 Arabs and 15 Jews were killed in widespread Israeli-Palestinian clashes, that a committee on the partial pullback from Hebron would get to work.</p>
<p>&quot;The parties reiterated their commitment to Oslo and its implementation,&quot; said Israeli negotiator Dore Gold, referring to peace deals forged between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation in the Norwegian capital.</p>
<p>Israeli officials said the Hebron committee would hold its first meeting on Monday at the Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Other committees on civilian, economic and security matters would also be activated, negotiators said.</p>
<p>&quot;What they agreed on was a work plan for this week in terms of the committees,&quot; said U.S. peace mediator Dennis Ross, who attended Sunday's talks.</p>
<p>&quot;They also agreed that it was important to get into a position where they would change the venue so they could continue in a very intensive way, a non-stop way, until they could reach agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>The negotiators met after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, urging quick progress, held separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>Christopher was sent to the area after U.S. President Bill Clinton held an Arab-Israeli summit in Washington to end the Israeli-Palestinian clashes triggered by Israel's opening of an archaelogical tunnel near Moslem holy places in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Palestinian frustrations had been mounting since the election last May of Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, who opposes trading occupied Arab land for peace -- the foundation of the U.S.-brokered peace process.</p>
<p>Netanyahu wants to modify security arrangements for Jewish settlers in Hebron, the last of seven West Bank towns to be given Palestinian self-rule, saying recent violence had made changes even more imperative.</p>
<p>The PLO has said it will oppose any attempt to renegotiate the redeployment accord reached with Israel's previous Labour-led government.</p>
<p>Netanyahu insisted on Sunday that any security modifications could be made &quot;within the confines of the existing agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat, asked if he was reassured by this, said: &quot;We'll wait and see.&quot;</p>
<p>Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters: &quot;We have a difficult task ahead of us. We are determined to exert every possible effort to expedite the implementation of the interim (peace) agreement on the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Dan Shomron, head of the Israeli delegation, said: &quot;We will have to restore with confidence-building measures a system of trust.&quot;</p>
<p>The Israeli army announced after Sunday's talks that it was lifting an &quot;internal closure&quot; of the West Bank towns of Tulkarm and Qalqilya and allowing Palestinian workers back to their jobs in Israeli-owned factories on the Gaza border.</p>
<p>It also said that 700 Palestinian labourers would be allowed into the Jewish state to pick olives.</p>
<p>Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, visiting Israel on behalf of the European Union to demonstrate its eagerness for a role in the U.S.-dominated peace process, held talks with Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not here to put pressure on either side,&quot; Spring said. &quot;We are here in the spirit of friendship and cooperation -- the longstanding cooperation that existed between Europe and the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority.&quot;</p>
