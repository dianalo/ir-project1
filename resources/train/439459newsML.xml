<p>China's first two cases of restructuring of listed state companies herald a new reform phase in the country's debt-ridden and inefficient state-owned enterprise sector, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Share ownership changes will help listed firms make their non-tradable state shares more liquid and make acquisitions and takeovers by other state-controlled entities more possible, they said.</p>
<p>But a key issue is what new assets will be injected into firms being acquired and how their new shareholders will achieve an improvement in the firms' performance, they added.</p>
<p>Shanghai Vacuum and Electron Devices Co Ltd said on Thursday that the ownership of all its state shares had been transferred to Shanghai Video and Audio Electric (Group) Co from Shanghai Electric Meters (Group) Co, a subsidiary of the Shanghai city government.</p>
<p>In a similar announcement, Shanghai Video and Audio Electric Co Ltd, a domestic A share firm listed in Shanghai, also said that its state shares had been transferred to the Shanghai Video and Audio Electric (Group) Co.</p>
<p>&quot;These cases are the first results of the serious efforts being made by the city government to reconstruct the assets of listed firms,&quot; said an executive with a Chinese listed firm.</p>
<p>&quot;They indicate that Shanghai is taking the lead in reforming the money-losing state firms.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vacuum statement did not give the price, or any other details of the ownership changes.</p>
<p>A Shanghai Vacuum spokesman reached by telephone said that all other details were under discussion.</p>
<p>Shanghai Vacuum, a television display tube maker, has 237.839 million state shares, making up 44.78 percent of the firm's 531.088 million outstanding shares.</p>
<p>The transfer makes Shanghai Video and Audio Electric (Group) Co, mainly a producer and trader of video and audio equipment, by far the biggest shareholder in Shanghai Vacuum.</p>
<p>These are the first cases of major changes to the share ownership of listed firms in the six-year history of modern China's stock markets.</p>
<p>The Shanghai city government said earlier this year that it would encourage healthy state enterprises to acquire large amounts of shares in poor-performing listed firms.</p>
<p>All of China's listed firms were formerly state-owned enterprises and many have failed to improve their management to suit to the requirements of a listed firm, resulting in poor performance, analysts said.</p>
<p>State shares still usually account for a large part, and in many cases the controlling part, of outstanding shares in China's listed firms.</p>
<p>State-controlled shares are not open to public trading.</p>
<p>&quot;State assets of listed companies will be much more liquid after deals such as Shanghai Vacuum,&quot; said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;One important issue is what new assets will be injected into acquired listed firms and how far the new stockholders can make their mark on the management,&quot; said one stock analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;Many listed firms need a thorough reconstruction instead of just a few modifications,&quot; he added.</p>
