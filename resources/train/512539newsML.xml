<p>Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said on Wednesday he had appointed a consultant to advise him on an equitable tax regime for South African registered ships.</p>
<p>Opening the National Maritime Conference in Cape Town, he said a draft law on ship registration and mortgages would be presented to the cabinet soon and should go to parliament this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The principle objective of the bill is to facilitate ship registration in South Africa by relaxing existing qualification requirements for certain classes of ships,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maharaj said it would be important to ensure that South African registered ships were able to compete internationally and said tax regulations would be crucial to this.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever justification exists for collecting tax from South African shipowners or operators, it is unlikely that the registration of ships bill will achieve its purpose if ships attached to the register cannot operate in a tax environment similar to their competition.</p>
<p>&quot;To this end and in conjunction with other role players, my department has appointed a consultant to research and make recommendations on the matter of taxation of ship owners,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maharaj said the South African ship register would require a genuine link between South Africa and the ship industry so that the country did not develop a convenience character.</p>
<p>&quot;The successful development of a South African ship register depends on creating a business environment conducive to domestic ship-owning and operating activities,&quot; he said.</p>
