<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Monday that ahead of European Monetary Union, Germany would stress implementation of the stability pact agreed at the Dublin summit in December after arduous negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;We attach particular importance to the growth and stability pact,&quot; which is designed to ensure that participating countries continue to exercise strict fiscal discipline even after the scheduled start of EMU in 1999, Waigel told a meeting of European finance ministers.</p>
<p>Germany was the main backer of the stability pact despite sometimes strenuous opposition. But Bonn itself is coming precariously close to missing the EMU deficit target of three percent of gross domestic product this year, the key year for deciding the starting line-up of EMU participants.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Germany revised upward its forecast of its 1997 deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP from 2.5 percent earlier. But officials said it would remain strict in its interpretation of the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>State secretary for finance Juergen Stark said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper on Monday, &quot;We will not be using the leeway that the treaty allows for interpreting the (convergence) criteria.&quot;</p>
<p>Waigel said to secure the success of EMU in the face of high unemployment, Germany and other countries must work to resolve the structural problems of the jobs market, as economic growth alone will remain too sluggish to create jobs.</p>
<p>High unemployment undermines efforts to meet the strict debt and deficit targets for EMU, by reducing tax revenues and increasing outlays for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Once EMU is implemented, participating countries will no longer be able to make use of foreign exchange adjustments as a buffer for their labour policies, Waigel said.</p>
<p>Although the official agenda for the finance ministers' meeting contained few momentous matters, delegates were expected to informally discuss a French proposal for a political &quot;stability council&quot; that would influence policy makers at the future European Central Bank.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has been an outspoken critic of the plan, defending the idea that the ECB must remain independent. But officials sought to play down expectations that the conflict would be resolved at the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;One cannot expect revolutionary or earth-shattering things every day,&quot; Stark said on his way into the meeting.</p>
<p>Jean-Claude Juncker, premier and finance minister of Luxembourg, said the proposed council would be an informal advisory body for government ministers to discuss monetary policy issues and not an attack on the independence of the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It happens in Germany the same way. Why not in Europe?&quot; Juncker told journalists ahead of the meeting.</p>
<p>Waigel said members of the European Union must now move on to attack the issue of unfair tax competition, by co-ordinating their value-added tax rates in particular.</p>
