<title>KENYA: Kenya shilling weakens, market still jittery.</title>
<headline>Kenya shilling weakens, market still jittery.</headline>
<dateline>NAIROBI 1997-04-28</dateline>

<p>The Kenyan shilling maintained its losing streak against the dollar on Monday on importer demand amid nervous trading, commercial bank dealers said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya posted a mean commercial rate of 55.22 against the dollar from 54.85 on Friday. Against the pound, the shilling was posted at 89.69 from 89.04.</p>
<p>Dealers said even at the current levels -- 55.00/55/50 -- the shilling was still trying to find its footing.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still confused. People are maintaining wide spreads because they're not even sure they should sell at 55.50,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Last week, dealers said a lot of the jitters in the market were a result of the absence from the market of the central bank. They said previously, the central banks' buying rates gave an indication of where rates should be.</p>
<p>&quot;What is happening now is that no one wants to be caught in any position. Everyone wants to be in a square position as much as possible,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The money market was tight with overnight rates quoted at 21-22 percent compared to 23 percent on Friday.</p>
