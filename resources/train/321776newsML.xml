<headline>Supreme Court quiet on U.S. credit union case.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Federal credit unions, hoping for a reprieve from strict court-imposed membership limits, got neither good news nor bad news from the Supreme Court on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The court had listed the credit union appeal of a lower court ruling on a list of petitions it would consider accepting at a Jan 17 meeting.</p>
<p>But when the court announced Tuesday the cases it had rejected at the conference, it made no mention of the credit union case. An announcement last Friday of cases it had accepted also did not mention the case.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're still waiting,&quot; said Virginia McGuire, spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, which urged the court not to hear the appeal. The court's next scheduled meeting to discuss such petitions is February 18.</p>
<p>The association and several banks initiated the lawsuit in 1990, when they sued to challenge a 1982 policy adopted by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) relaxing previous membership limits.</p>
<p>Lower courts have agreed with the banks and imposed membership limits on thousands of credit unions, which are cooperative non-profits that offer bank-like services.  </p>
<p>Until 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighborhood. But, that year, the NCUA began allowing credit unions to include members from multiple, distinct groups.</p>
<p>That angered banks, which contended that some of the larger tax-exempt credit unions posed unfair competition. In 1990, the banks sued a North Carolina credit union that had grown to encompass more than a hundred groups.</p>
<p>The federal appeals court for the District of Columbia last year ruled the NCUA had exceeded its authority.  </p>
<p>A lower court then ordered credit unions to stop accepting members from more than one group, although the order was partially suspended until the Supreme Court makes a decision or declines to hear the case.</p>
