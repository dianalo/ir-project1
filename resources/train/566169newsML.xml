<headline>Malaysia rubber falls further at close.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysian rubber prices fell further in late trading and closed lower after lack of consumer demand and weak overseas markets dampening sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;There was hardly any business transacted and people are not willing to trade in the absence strong leads,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Players were not willing to commit themselves on expectations of lower prices, they said, adding that a larger inflow of supply into the market also eased prices.</p>
<p>At the close, May RSS Ones buyer fell four cents to 271.50 cents ($1.08) a tonne and May SMR 20 buyer was down 1.50 cents at 256 cents.  </p>
<p>Traders offered the SMR CV at 331 cents, SMR L at 309, SMR 5 at 268, SMR 10 at 254 and drum latex at 226 cents.</p>
<p>Demand from both Asia and Europe continued slow as buyers were seen reluctant to trade because of lower Tokyo prices.</p>
<p>The INRO five-day average was 207.90 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg on May 6 from 208.06 on May 5.</p>
<p>The daily indicator was 207.45 against 208.64. -- Tan Lee Lee (603-230-7510) ($1=2.5125 ringgit)</p>
