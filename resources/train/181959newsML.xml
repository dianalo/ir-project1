<title>UK: Freight market pauses, rise may be overdone.</title>
<headline>Freight market pauses, rise may be overdone.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>The freight market rise paused today, at least as far as tonnage covered by the Baltic Freight Index which rose by a relatively modest 13 points to 1515.</p>
<p>Charterers attempted to play down future prospects - if not actually saying &quot;it will be all over by Christmas&quot;, they were claiming that because the market had risen so quickly, the rise had become overdone and there would be a reaction soon.</p>
<p>Some reckoned the number of Panamax orders was thinning out, especially in the Pacific, and that those outstanding would have been covered by about December 10 and would then be followed by a traditional holiday decline.</p>
<p>Others believed demand in the Atlantic would be sustained into January, or as long as it takes to shift the backlog of grain and fertilizer shipments to China.</p>
<p>Owners' brokers conceded that some steam may have gone out of the Pacific market temporarily, but claimed that there was a solid book of orders stretching into mid-december from USGulf.</p>
<p>Owners' confidence appeared to some extent justified by reports of further activity in the Panamax period market, tonnage being fixed in the east for 12 months at between $8,750 or $10,000 daily depending on age, as well as for shorter periods of 3-5 months $1,000-2,000 more.</p>
<p>Owners' brokers also claimed that the general tone of the Caper market was better today, supported by more enquiry. Handy-sizes remained out of favour nearly everywhere except for larger types on the continent.</p>
<p>GRAIN - There was some talk of charterers moderating their rate ideas from USGulf. Dreyfus were said to be trading Great Dove 67,670 dwt for grain to China at between $27.00 and $28.00 and Glencore were believed to be involved in similar business, both for mid-November shipment.</p>
<p>It was said today Glencore's fixture of Stalo from USGulf at $16,000 daily plus $300,000 bonus was for grain to Malaysia.</p>
<p>Reports of Halla's fixture of M Huri Cerrahoglu for 54,000 heavy grain USGulf/Taiwan for Dec 1/10 at $23.35 were met with amazement in the market that the owner could agree such a low level, especially since it was rumoured Pan Ocean had offered the vessel $13,000 daily on timecharter basis to the east.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the 1981-built Anangel Argonaut 65,668 dwt was said to be trading Japanese charterers delivery Passero Nov 20 trip via USGulf to the far east at $14,000 daily against $13,250 daily, evidence of a still steady market.</p>
<p>In the far east Emirates Trading fixed Thalassini Niki 72,700 dwt and Space 69,000 dwt delivery mid-Nov Japan for trips via Australia to the Arabian Gulf at $14,000 and $13,000 daily respectively but failed on subjects on both.</p>
<p>Little news was heard of Handy-Sizes but Cargill booked 35,000 heavy grain USGulf/Antwerp at $14.25 and 15,000 pellets Up River/Tunisia at $26.50, both for mid Nov and both economical for charterers.</p>
<p>MINERALS - There was some difficulty establishing the facts of rumoured fixtures in the far east of Berge Master 143,000 dwt and Huang Shan 166,000 dwt.</p>
<p>China Act 149,000 dwt was taken by Interbulk delivery Redcar early Dec for about 70-130 days on private terms.</p>
<p>It emerged that the 1978-built Anthia 81,796 dwt was fixed at the end of last week by UBT with fertilizers from Black Sea to India at close to $13,000 daily. In the Middle East Glencore Asia were linked with Hunter 72,059 dwt on subjects delivery Muscat trip via Richards Bay with coal to Cigading.</p>
<p>Timecharter business of 3-5 months was reckoned fixed by Rex Friendship 61,271 dwt basis delivery Bin Qasim on private terms and by Evgenia 69,428 dwt delivery Ulsan to Van Ommeren at a reported $11,600 daily.</p>
<p>Atlantic sovereign 68,641 dwt which sailed North Japan yesterday was understood booked for a Pacific round at $13,750 daily by South Korean charterers.</p>
