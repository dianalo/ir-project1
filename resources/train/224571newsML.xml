<p>The Portuguese government is preparing a bill to present to parliament soon which will toughen disciplinary steps in cases of corruption in soccer, official sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Soccer federations will have the right to punish offenders found guilty of violence, drug abuse and corruption, the sources told Reuters. Offenders could be subject to bans lasting from five to 10 years.</p>
<p>The bill would make  clear that the acceptance of loans or gifts would be an offence subject to dismissal.</p>
<p>Parties involved in bribery will face fines under the bill, the sources said. Teams involved in bribery cases could be stripped of championship points, relegated or banned from competitions.</p>
<p>Allegations of match-rigging involving club directors and referees have dominated the news in recent weeks. Last week a court sentenced the chairman of first division side Leca and a former referee to prison for bribery.</p>
