<p>Thai economic indicators for December and January released by the finance ministry on Wednesday were mildly positive but failed to show that a slowdown had bottomed out, analysts said.</p>
<p>The indicators showed that the December trade and current account deficits narrowed to 22.3 billion and 19.1 billion baht ($857.7 million and $734.6 million) from 24.2 billion and 21.7 billion respectively in November.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said the smaller December deficits helped curb the current account deficit for the whole of 1996 to 8.0 percent of gross domestic product against 8.2 percent estimated earlier by the central bank and an actual 8.1 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Amnuay said on Wednesday he expected the current account deficit to narrow to at least 7.5 percent of GDP in 1997.</p>
<p>He said weak Thai exports had broken an earlier seven-month downtrend and inflation, standing at 5.8 percent in 1996, had also eased in recent months. &quot;I believe the current account deficit could be brought down at least 0.50 percentage point this year (from the 1996 level of 8.0 percent),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The minister said he expected his fiscal and monetary policies would gradually produce positive results which, Thailand hoped, would help convince Moody's Investors Service not to downgrade the country's long-term sovereign debts.</p>
<p>Moody's announced in mid-February that it was reviewing Thailand's A2 foreign currency sovereign ceilings for bonds and bank deposits for possible downgrade.</p>
<p>Ministry figures showed foreign reserves bucked a two-month decline to end January at $39.2 billion against $38.7 billion a month earlier.</p>
<p>They also posted a 24.7 billion baht balance of payments surplus in January against rare monthly deficits of 19.2 billion and 6.2 billion baht in December and November respectively.</p>
<p>But analysts said although latest monthly figures on industrial output and private investment showed some recovery, there were no indications that economic sluggishness seen since the second half of 1996 had been reversed.</p>
<p>&quot;All growth indicators still look pretty anemic. The question now is not whether we can bring inflation and current account deficit under control. What we should ask is whether most companies can survive the current downturn without going bankrupt first,&quot; an analyst at a Thai finance firm said.</p>
<p>The ministry figures said the December manufacturing index posted 4.8 percent year-on-year growth which, although higher than 4.1 percent in November, was still far below average expansion of over 10 percent that Thailand experienced during the first half of the 1990s.</p>
<p>The December private investment index eased further to 7.5 percent year-on-year growth from 7.8 percent in November and 14.3 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>The ministry said total outstanding loans extended by Thai commercial banks continued its downward growth trend, rising about 13.7 percent year-on-year in January against 14.3 percent in December and 22.9 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>Another analyst at Dhana Siam Finance and Securities said it was premature to say whether the latest improving indicators could be sustained at a pace to have an impact on the review of Thailand's debts.</p>
<p>She said although the monthly current account deficit had been on a clear and steady declining trend in the past few months, foreign analysts had turned to focus on vulnerable positions of some financial institutions, especially those with big loan exposures to the property sector.</p>
<p>The analyst said her foreign colleagues also watched the private sector's short-term foreign loans which were responsible for raising the country's total foreign debts to about $89.6 billion at end-December.</p>
<p>The ministry figures, however, said that short-term debts accounted for 43.7 percent of total foreign borrowing in December against 49.8 percent a year earlier.</p>
