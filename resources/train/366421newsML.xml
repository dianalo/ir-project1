<p>This is how major world bond markets were trading in late European business on Monday.</p>
<p>GERMANY - German Bunds and futures were higher in late dealings, hovering just below new record levels set in earlier trade as the market defied expectations for another bout of consolidation to extend recent gains. The March Bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) was trading at 102.69, up 0.15 from Friday's settlement price.</p>
<p>BRITAIN - Gilts reversed a healthy rally which took them to new all-time highs earlier, dipping into negative territory at the close as profit-takers cashed in on recent strength. The March long gilt future on LIFFE was trading at 113-00/32, down 07/32 from Friday's settlement price.</p>
<p>FRANCE - The French 10-year bond future settled just off a new all-time high but volume was extremely thin and analysts were unsure the strong performance would last. The March notional bond future on the MATIF in Paris settled at 131.46, up 0.18 from Friday's settlement price.</p>
<p>ITALY - Italian debt markets subsided at the close, taking a contrary direction to other markets, with a lack of features weighing them down. The lira was also giving ground to the mark, which was generally firm. The March bond future on LIFFE was trading at 131.03, down 0.27 from Friday's settlement price.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - U.S. Treasuries remained lower at mid-morning with little data due before Thursday's release of retail sales. The March Treasury bond future on the Chicago Board of Trade was trading at 112-18/32, up 04/32 from Friday's settlement price. The long bond was quoted to yield 6.70 percent.</p>
<p>JAPAN - Key March 10-year Japanese government bond futures closed lower after failing to hit new highs in the morning. The March rose as high as 126.80 in early trade following the yen's rise after the weekend Group of Seven meeting. In after hours trading the March future on LIFFE was trading at 126.39, down 0.31 from Friday's settlement price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>EUROBONDS - A trio of innovative issues was awaited by the primary market after a steady start to the week. Fannie Mae said it was planing a sterling global bond, the first such deal, via BZW and Merrill Lynch. The first corporate euro offering, a three-legged affair from Siemens, was set to take centre stage. Panama's Euromarket debut, a $500 million bond, was due. Spintab set a $400 million five-year at a 30 basis point spread. Abbey National launched a $200 million two-year bond.</p>
