<title>LEBANON: Israeli forces kill Lebanese civilian.</title>

<p>Israeli forces killed a 70-year old Lebanese civilian in south Lebanon early on Saturday, U.N. peacekeepers said.</p>
<p>An Israeli tank fired one round of anti-personnel shells at the village of Adsheet Al-Kosseir inside Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone, an officer with the U.N. Interim Forces In Lebanon (UNIFIL) told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ahmed Sayyed Swaidan, picking up vegetation for his animals near his house inside the village, was killed immediately, the officer added.</p>
<p>Israel said on Saturday it &quot;unintentionally&quot; shot and killed a Lebanese civilian overnight in south Lebanon.</p>
<p>&quot;A Lebanese citizen was unintentionally killed by Israeli army gunfire as he walked in a suspicious area late at night...known to be a location where there are only terrorists,&quot; an Israel army spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;An initial investigation carried out by the unit commander showed that the unit followed operational procedures and did not veer from its orders,&quot; she said, adding &quot;the army expresses regret over the incident.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel holds a 15-km (nine mile)-wide border zone in south Lebanon. Pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas have been fighting to oust the Israeli troops and their local militia allies from the area.</p>
<p>A U.S. brokered ceasefire understanding that ended a 17-year Israeli onslaught on Lebanon in April 1996 bars the targeting of civilian areas by Israeli forces or Hizbollah.</p>
