<text>
<p>Middle East very large crude carrier (VLCC) rates to Japan dipped on Tuesday but some brokers said there was a shortage of available tonnage nevertheless.</p>
<p>The 250,000 tonne Eleo Maersk was fixed at W60 for Idemitsu loading March 28, down some 2.5 points but one broker said this appeared to be an aberration.</p>
<p>&quot;That fixture was much lower than expected...We feel that the market should be higher. There is not much tonnage for the balance of March and we hope to see the advances of last week maintained,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Another broker said Mideast/Red Sea VLCCs were being fixed at a soft W57.5, and that the discount compared with trips to Japan was unusually small.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan rates are out of kilter at the moment as there is usually a premium of five or 7.5 points over the Red Sea,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Mideast/Singapore trips were also fixed around W57.5.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean market was softer on low enquiry with 80,000 tonne cross-Med hops fixed around W115, down from W120 last week, with the 130,000 tonne sector quiet at W100, an Italian broker said.</p>
<p>West Africa/U.S. Gulf VLCCs were steady at W67.5, with 130,000 tonnes also unchanged at W102.5, while the transatlantic VLCC market was quiet. Transatlantic 130,000 tonne cargoes were assessed at around W105.</p>
<p>In the inter-U.K./Cont sector, 80,000 tonnes was  fixed at a steady W115, with 25,000 tonne fuel oil cargoes likewise unchanged at W205.</p>
<p>Caribs/upcoast 70,000 tonnes firmed to W157.5 from W150 on weather delays and a lack of prompt ships, although enquiry levels were fairly low, one broker said. Fuel oil 50,000 tonne cargoes rose to W200 from W190. --London newsroom +44 171 542 4088</p>
