<p>Austrian shares powered to a new all-time closing high on Monday, breaching the key 1,300 points mark in the ATX index for the first time, but were driven off earlier peaks by a bout of last-minute profit taking.</p>
<p>Most market participants said they expected the bull run to last for at least another few days, but warned slim volumes would make it difficult to sustain more long-term advances. Strong resistance is expected at around 1,350 to 1,360 points.</p>
<p>The ATX index of 21 blue chips rose 1.43 percent, or 18.42 points, to close at 1,309.12 after trading in a range between 1,286.38 and 1,313.88 points. Among its constituents, 18 gainers outweighed two decliners, one share closed unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;It's real bullish,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It sure looks like the Vienna market is finally getting over its months-long underperformance.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the advance was driven by demand for selected issues such as VA Technologie and Flughafen Wien, while strong international leads and the firmer dollar lent extra support.</p>
<p>Engineering group VA Technologie topped the day's gainers, rising 3.85 percent to 2,191.10 schillings, off a new year-high of 2,244.20 hit earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Shares of airport operator Flughafen Wien were up 8.3 schilligns at 516. Traders said the stock continued to be undervalued relative to the overall market and still had some catching up to do.</p>
<p>Brick maker Wienerberger was up 20 schillings at 2,495, below a new year-high of 2,501 seen earlier in the day, after the stock went ex-dividend.</p>
<p>Energy and chemicals group OMV was 29.80 schillings higher at 1,590 ahead of the release of final first-quarter figures expected for Tuesday.</p>
<p>Preference shares of Bank Austria led the day's decliners, easing 1.07 percent to 445.20.</p>
<p>On the Vienna futures and options exchange, ATX contracts for June delivery rose 20 points to 1,311.0 on volume of 804 contracts.</p>
