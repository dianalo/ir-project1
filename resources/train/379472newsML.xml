<title>ISRAEL: No breakthrough yet to resume Israel-Syria talks.</title>
<headline>No breakthrough yet to resume Israel-Syria talks.</headline>

<p>Israel said on Friday that discussions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton achieved no breakthrough in efforts to resume peace talks with Syria.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is still no breakthrough between us and the Syrians,&quot; Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh told Israel Radio in a telephone interview from Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeking a formula that will bring renewal of the negotiations between Israel and Syria. The discussion between the prime minister and President Clinton dealt with that among other things yesterday but I cannot say that at this stage there is a breakthrough.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday, at a news conference with Netanyahu after their fourth meeting since the Israeli prime minister took office, Clinton said he was hopeful Israel and Syria would resume talks.</p>
<p>&quot;I do feel encouraged by the discussions we've had that there are things worth working on, but I have nothing specific to say at this time,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Later, Netanyahu gave no indication he was prepared to soften his refusal to give up occupation of the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;No. We have a stated position,&quot; he told reporters at the Defence Department, where he met Defence Secretary William Cohen. &quot;It is clear that we think the Golan Heights is crucial, vital territory for the defence of Israel. And that position has not changed.&quot;</p>
<p>Naveh said Netanyahu had brought a &quot;creative&quot; formula for re-starting the Syrian-Israeli talks suspended nearly a year ago after Palestinian militant suicide attacks killed 59 people in Israel. But Naveh declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Asked if the next stage would be a U.S. envoy taking Israel's proposals to Damascus, Naveh said: &quot;I don't think we've reached that stage. I think after the visit here, the American administration will be in contact also with the Syrians.&quot;</p>
<p>Syria says the previous Israeli government that was defeated in elections last May by Netanyahu's Likud party had agreed to return all of the Golan Heights.</p>
<p>But Netanyahu has rejected trading land for peace and insists that talks should resume without any conditions.</p>
<p>The previous government publicly said it was willing to make a partial pullback from the Golan.</p>
