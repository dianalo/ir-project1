<p>The following is a selection of analysts' reactions to Japan's customs-cleared trade data for September and for the 1996/97 first half, released on Friday.</p>
<p>The September trade surplus fell 30.3 percent from a year ago to 779.52 billion yen, while the surplus stood at 2.90 trillion yen for the six months through September.</p>
<p>Analysts had estimated a trade surplus of between 720 billion and 906 billion yen in September after a surplus of 1.12 trillion yen a year earlier.</p>
<p>HIROMASA KUBO, GENERAL MANAGER ECONOMIC RESEARCH AT MARUBENI CORP: &quot;It's within an expected range.&quot;  </p>
<p>CHRIS CALDERWOOD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BZW:</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a reminder that the pace of the decline is going to moderate somewhat. Oil prices will keep downward pressure on the trade surplus, but it seems the period of trade adjustment is drawing to a close.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It (the surplus) could well stop falling by the beginning of 1997,&quot; he said, adding that firmer exports were a major factor in the declining pace at which the surplus was shrinking. &quot;Generally, the yen is allowing them (exporters) to put their houses in order, cut prices and get back into markets more aggressively.&quot;  </p>

<p>However, growth in the volume of imports is becoming stagnant, he said. &quot;Beginning next year, I suppose the speed of the decline in the surplus will decelerate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I predict the surplus in the current balance would be around seven trillion yen (for the whole fiscal year).&quot;</p>
<p>CHRIS PAVLOU, TREASURER, GLOBAL MARKETS, MIDLAND BANK</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think anybody should be unhappy about these figures. They are very good for everyone...the balance with the United States is coming down nicely...all the trade agreements between Japan and the United States are beginning to take effect.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;As slowly as the economy is picking up here, you're going to see the deficit between the United States and Japan narrowing.&quot;</p>
