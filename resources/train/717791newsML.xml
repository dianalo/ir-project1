<headline>NZ's Peters says NZ deserves AAA credit rating.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1997-07-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Zealand Treasurer Winston Peters said on Wednesday the country deserved an AAA rating from credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's.</p>
<p>Speaking to Reuters Financial Television in Sydney and monitored in Wellington, Peters said S&amp;P could be more sympathetic in its approach to New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are not being treated as sympathetically as we should be on this score,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>New Zealand currently has an AA-plus sovereign rating.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P is visiting New Zealand later this week as part of a regular review of credit conditions, but it says New Zealand's outlook is stable and it has indicated no plans to upgrade it.</p>
<p>Asked if S&amp;P was being unfair, Peters replied that it could be more fair.</p>
<p>He said New Zealand was one of only nine countries that could claim an unbroken line of democracy for the last 130 years, &quot;so we are very, very politically stable&quot;.</p>
<p>New Zealand had handled a new form of elections with &quot;the greatest of ease&quot;, as a mixed member proportional voting system took the place of the British-style system in October last year.  </p>
<p>&quot;Alongside that we've had significant, dramatic debt repayment, we've had also a significant decline in the proportion of government expenditure to GDP. These are all fundamentally sound indicators,&quot; Peters said.</p>
