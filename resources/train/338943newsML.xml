<headline>Spain's six-month bills seen stable at auction.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-01-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>After a steady decline in recent months, the yield on Spanish six-month Treasury bills may remain stable at an auction on Wednesday, dealers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The yield is likely to come out between 5.35 percent and 5.40, little different from 5.342 percent, an all-time record low from the last auction on January 15.</p>
<p>&quot;Short-term deposit rates were increasing a bit in recent days and T-bills were attracting less interest,&quot; a money market dealer in Madrid said.</p>
<p>Other dealers, noting that one-year bills yields are lower than those on six-month paper, added that the Spanish Treasury could decide to allocate fewer six-month bills in favour of a bigger allocation on the one-year tranche.</p>
<p>At their latest auction one-year bills showed a minimum yield at 5.0542 pct.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have to forget that the Spanish Treasury is in a very good situation..and do not think they will make their debt more expensive,&quot; he said.</p>
