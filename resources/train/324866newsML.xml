<p>The U.S. Congress is sure to override the Internal Revenue Service on how to tax &quot;forward contracts,&quot; a popular merchandising tool for farmers, but probably after 1996 tax payments are due, senators said Wednesday.</p>
<p>During a news confernece, farm-state senators said they would seek speedy passage of a bill to overrule the IRS and urged the agency not to employ the disputed approach in the interim.  </p>
<p>There has been widespread concern in farm country for several months because the IRS said a potato farmer, when calculating the alternative minimum tax, had to report all income from a forward contract in the year it was signed, although some was paid the following year.</p>
<p>Forward contracts are widely used by farmers to lock-in advantageous prices or to balance income and expenses.</p>
<p>Bills were pending in the House and Senate to exempt income from forward contracts from being counted when the alternative minimum tax was calculated.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're here in a way to say, Shame on you, IRS,&quot; said Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, a leading sponsor of the Senate bill, which has 54 backers.</p>
<p>Senators said the potato case was being used by the IRS to unjustifiably demand farmers pay larger tax bills. They were unanimous in predicting victory but said it might take months to get a law enacted. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has said he would accept the legislation.</p>
<p>Senator Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, said the IRS had informally promised not to invoke its interpretation while Congress worked on legislation.</p>
<p>But Conrad and other senators expressed uneasiness at the prospect that farmers would file tax returns in April before the issue was settled.</p>
