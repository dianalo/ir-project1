<p>Agie Charmilles Holding, the engineering group formed by the recent merger of Agie Holding AG and Charmilles Technolgies, said its board of directors had decided to issue free options to its shareholders and it was confident it would meet its targets for 1996.</p>
<p>Agie Charmilles also said in a statement that it was confident the group's positive development would continue in 1997 and the group's priority remains to maintain profitability at a sustainable and high level.</p>
<p>Agie Charmilles was formed in October last year when Agie merged with Georg Fischer AG's Charmilles unit. It develops and manufactures electro-erosion machinery.</p>
<p>The plan to issue of shareholder options was announced last September. Following the merger, Georg Fischer held about 78 percent of Agie Charmilles.</p>
<p>&quot;The board of directors is confident that the targets set during the summer for 1996 fiscal year will be met,&quot; the company said, adding that a respectable result was expected despite a continuing difficult economic environment.</p>
<p>Assuming that Agie and Charmilles had been merged at the start of 1996, the group estimated pro forma 1996 sales amount to 807 million francs, operating profit, or EBIT, of 44 million and net profit of 23 million.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the exercise of the options will be used to strengthen the company's equity and repay a 60.5 million Swiss franc loan from Georg Fischer AG, Agie Charmilles said.</p>
<p>Holders of 1,753,125 registered shares will be given one warrant per share. Two warrants entitle the holder to buy one registered share, nominal value 20 francs, for 85 francs.</p>
<p>The exercise period is January 13 to May 15.</p>
<p>The registered shares subscribed to will have full dividend rights for 1997. The company has asked the Swiss Exchange to list the options from January 13 to May 14.</p>
