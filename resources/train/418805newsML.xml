<p>Istanbul shares dived for the second day in a row on Tuesday amid political concerns and higher-than-expected February inflation, but rebounded sharply in late trade, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed at 1,443, down 79 points, or 5.19 percent from Monday when it sank 5.58 percent. Towards the close, It bounced from an afternoon low of 1,325 on reaction buys.  </p>
<p>The market index has slumped 10.48 percent since Friday.</p>
<p>Trade volume rose to 28.73 trillion lira from 23.14 trillion on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Political tension mounted after the National Security Council warnings at the weekend, prompting sales which accelerated on selling by players who had bought shares on loans,&quot; said Erdal Hanyaloglu from Altay securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The two-day steep fall created a technical weakness. The market may initially try to restore the index's support at 1,500,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Brokers said bond yields which jumped as much as eight points to around 103 percent levels on higher-than expected February inflation would be negative for the market unless there was a decline in the yields.</p>
<p>February wholesale prices rose 6.2 percent from 5.6 percent in January and consumer prices rose 5.7 percent after 5.9 percent the previous month. Previous forecasts were between 4.5 and 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>More-than-expected inflation data also fuelled dollar demand which caused the central bank to intervene in the morning.</p>
<p>Of the 238 shares traded, losers outdid gainers sharply by 202 to 15 and 21 closed stable. The IMKB Industrial shed 5.84 percent to 1,482, the IMKB Services sank 5.09 percent to 1,286 and the IMKB Financial slumped 4.08 percent to 1,528.</p>
<p>Leading actives were largely state-owned flat steel giant Eregli, down 1,000 lira at 18,750, T.Isbank's C series shares, down 500 lira at 37,000, utility Cukurova Elektrik, down 15,000 lira at 180,000, state oil refiner Tupras, down 2,000 lira at 58,000 and Yapi Kredi Bank, down 700 lira at 4,800.</p>
<p>They made up 25 percent of the total turnover.</p>
