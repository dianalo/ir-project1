<p>Iran's culture and Islamic guidance minister designate has rejected attacks by Iranian conservatives that he advocated resuming ties with the United States and said he opposed holding talks with Washington.</p>
<p>Ataollah Mohajerani, nominated in the proposed cabinet of moderate President Mohammad Khatami, has been criticised by conservatives for his advocacy of greater cultural freedoms and his call in 1990 for direct talks with the United States.</p>
<p>Iran's parliament is due to start debating the cabinet nominations on Tuesday. Some analysts have said that the 270-seat Majlis was expected to approve the majority of Khatami's 22-member cabinet but vote against Mohajerani.</p>
<p>Mohajerani told the official news agency IRNA that he had written a newspaper article in 1990 proposing a start of direct talks with the United States but not the resumption of ties.</p>
<p>He said his article was in reaction to what he said were U.S. calls at the time for negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;After a while, the supreme leadership of the Islamic revolution dismissed the possibility of any talks with the U.S. and it was natural that I should obey the order,&quot; he said. &quot;Now the situation has changed and under the current circumstances I reject even holding talks with the U.S.,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Speculation has grown since Khatami's election in May that ties between Tehran and Washington could improve, but analysts do not predict any major or rapid changes as Iranian foreign policy remains in the hands of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has rejected the possibility of a thaw in ties.</p>
