<p>A commission investigating the 1988 assassination of popular Sri Lankan politician Vijaya Kumaratunga on Friday issued its final report, saying the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was indirectly involved.</p>
<p>The Presidential Commission's report, issued on Friday, also said late Deputy Defence Minister Ranjan Wijeratne interfered with the police investigation into the case.</p>
<p>Vijaya Kumaratunga, husband of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, was gunned down by two motorcyclists on February 16, 1988. He had been expected to run in the 1989 presidential elections on a broad leftist ticket.</p>
<p>&quot;The totality of the evidence stated above, in our view, establishes a prima facie case against President Ranasinghe Premadasa and Minister Ranjan Wijerante, as to their indirect involvement in the assassination of Vijaya Kumaratunga,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;(The commission) has quite clearly stated that (the killing of Vijaya Kumaratunga) was a politically motivated action,&quot; President Kumaratunga told a news conference on Friday. &quot;They have definitely pointed their fingers at two individuals.&quot;</p>
<p>Friday's report did not say what precise role Premadasa played in the killing, other than to say he was indirectly involved and that he had a clear motive.</p>
<p>&quot;It was suggested that the motive for the assassination of Vijaya Kumaratunga was that he became a formidable rival to Prime Minister Premadasa at the presidential stakes,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Premadasa was prime minister at the time of the assassination and won the presidential elections the next year.</p>
<p>Premadasa also led the then-ruling United National Party (UNP), now the main opposition party, until he was killed by a suspected Tamil guerrilla in May 1993. The UNP ceded power to Chandrika Kumaratunga's People's Alliance coalition in the 1994 general and presidential elections.</p>
<p>Wijeratne was also killed by a suspected Tamil guerrilla, in March 1991.</p>
<p>A UNP spokesman contacted by Reuters said the party would not comment on the report until party leaders had studied the 85-page document.</p>
<p>Soon after the assassination, Premadasa's government blamed Vijaya's killing on left-wing JVP (People's Liberation Front) insurgents who launched an abortive insurrection in the south of the country.</p>
<p>Thousands of youths were killed in the uprising as pro-government death squads and JVP insurgents went on the rampage, killing each other's supporters.</p>
<p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga said she would consult with the attorney-general before her government made its next move in the case.</p>
