<p>Italian league leaders Juventus travel to Paris for Wednesday's European Supercup clash with French side Paris St. Germain, apparently unconcerned by a recent loss of form.</p>
<p>While the French club were preparing in the sunshine of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, Juventus were going through a mini-slump in wintry Italy, picking up just two points in their last three league games to now lead joint second-placed teams Sampdoria and Internazionale by just two points.</p>
<p>Draws with Piacenza and Atalanta and a defeat last week by Parma contrast with the bright form shown by Juventus during an unbeaten autumn run in the Champions League, a period when Juventus also won the World Club cup in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Club coach Marcello Lippi argues that a temporary loss of form during a long season is normal, saying after Sunday's 0-0 home draw with Atalanta : &quot;If anyone thinks that a team can remain 100 per cent for 11 months, then he doesn't know much about Italian soccer.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always going to be a period, in this case perhaps co-incidental with our Christmas training load, when the side is not its usual brilliant self&quot;.</p>
<p>Experienced Juventus defender Ciro Ferrara agrees with his coach, playing down the team's recent dip.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it the Tokyo effect ?  I don't know...the important thing now is to limit the damages but we don't need to get ourselves worked up about it since, after all, we're still out in front&quot;.</p>
<p>For the first leg of the Supercup, Juventus will be without Croat striker Alen Boksic, who picked up an ankle injury against Atalanta.</p>
<p>Captain Antonio Conte is still out with a long-term injury while Portugese defender Manuel Dimas is cup-tied.</p>
<p>Michele Padovano will probably join Alessandro Del Piero in attack with Nicola Amoruso on stand-by.</p>
<p>One player who may not feature in the Paris game is striker Christian Vieri, who came on as a substitute for Boksic against Atalanta but was then himself substituted by Amoruso after only 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Although media speculation suggests Vieri had an angry dressing room disagreement with Lippi at halftime, the coach himself claimed that he had substituted Vieri for &quot;technical reasons&quot;, adding :</p>
<p>&quot;I sent on Amoruso because I needed a player who would put himself about and tempt the Atalanta defenders out of their own penalty area&quot;.</p>
<p>Wednesday's game is one of two potentially difficult games this week for Juventus who on Sunday travel south to face Lazio in Rome for a match which marks the halfway point in the 34 game Serie A season.</p>
<p>Lippi argues that his side's recent mini-setbacks just prove that the Italian title race is wide open.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't just our closest rivals, Inter and Sampdoria, who won today but also Milan and Parma.</p>
<p>&quot;We've always said that the championship battle was far from finished and none of the contenders are yet out of the contest,&quot; he said.</p>
