<p>Stock markets in many parts of Asia got off to a rousing start on Monday in response to Wall Street's record-breaking advance that followed Friday's news of weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data for September.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks resumed a rally which had stalled briefly on Friday ahead of the U.S. figures, with the Hang Seng Index gaining 201.85 points, or 1.70 percent, to 12,107.36 at the break.</p>
<p>But investors continued to bail out of Thai stocks, with the key stock index falling 53.17 points, or 5.29 percent, to 951.72 in morning trade.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, technical indicators point to an upside target of 12,200 for the index, said David Williamson, sales director at UBS Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's rise comes chiefly in response to a more favourable U.S. bond market, which was reacting to the U.S. unemployment report...,&quot; said Williamson.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 60 points on Friday to close 1.01 percent higher at 5,993, while the U.S. Treasury's key 30-year bond soared 1-1/4 points, pushing the yield down to 6.74 percent, the lowest in two months.</p>
<p>The catalyst for the gains was an unexpected drop of 40,000 in the September non-farm payrolls figure reported on Friday, which was contrary to the 166,000 gain economists had forecast and a rise of 241,000 in August.</p>
<p>Bond traders viewed the news as a sign the U.S. economy was slowing and that the Federal Reserve acted appropriately when it decided to leave interest rates unchanged at its recent meeting.</p>
<p>Seoul stocks zoomed ahead in midday trade by 20.32 points, or 2.61 percent, to 797.63 on broad-based buying and speculation the government could launch an economic stimulus package.</p>
<p>Malaysian shares also joined in the advance, rising 2.25 points to 1,152.43 at lunch, while Indonesian shares were up 1.35 points at 589.7 at the break.</p>
<p>Australia's All Ordinaries Index was up 25 points, or 1.08 percent, at 2,340.5, while in New Zealand shares closed 30.48 points higher at 2,274.76.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, domestic factors overshadowed the jubilation on Wall Street.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, foreigners were worried that Thailand's slowing economy may not get proper attention as the country heads for an election on November 17, said Rapeeporn Wongwikrai of Multi Credit Corp of Thailand.</p>
<p>Brokers said foreigners were unloading stocks to probably switch to other countries which could offer higher returns.</p>
<p>Tokyo stocks were lower on uncertainty over the upcoming general election and a listing on Tuesday of railway shares JR West.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is waiting for the JR West listing on Tuesday and the elections...making buying difficult,&quot; said Dai-ichi Securities analyst Akishige Ishikura.</p>
<p>The key Nikkei 225-issue index was down 83.15 points at 21,064.88 in early afternoon trade.</p>
<p>Taiwan shares turned lower on concern over the growing tensions between Tokyo and Taipei in a dispute over the Diaoyu (Senkaku) Islands.</p>
<p>The weighted index closed down 24.24 points, or 0.36 percent, at 6,620.42.</p>
<p>Singapore's Straits Times Index also fell in midday trade, reflecting a slowdown in key industry sectors and uncertainty over the island-state's general election, which must be held by April next year.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Index was off 23.46 points, or 1.09 percent, at 2,125.40.</p>
