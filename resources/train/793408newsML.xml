<p>Soldiers in Sierra Leone on Tuesday executed a colleague in front of a cheering crowd who had demanded instant justice for a petrol station killing, witnesses said.</p>
<p>An angry crowd pursued the soldier to the police station in the capital Freetown after he shot dead a 27-year-old mechanic for refusing to hand over a can of petrol, a scarce commodity in sanctions-hit Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>As the crowd yelled for the soldier to be brought out, other troops rushed into the station and dragged out the fugitive.</p>
<p>&quot;The soldiers stripped off his uniform and shot him at least five times,&quot; one witness said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are happy that the soldiers did what they did,&quot; another witness said. &quot;I do not approve of jungle justice but something needed to be done to instil discipline in the military.&quot;</p>
<p>Sierra Leone is facing a crushing embargo from its West African neighbours demanding the restoration of the elected government toppled by soldiers on May 25.</p>
<p>Most motorists have parked their cars for lack of petrol or the threat of marauding soldiers. Shops, banks and other businesses remain closed despite repeated warnings by junta leaders for their owners to reopen them.</p>
<p>The Economic Community of West African States this month ordered a tightening of the embargo after the collapse of diplomatic talks for a peaceful restoration of civilian rule.</p>
