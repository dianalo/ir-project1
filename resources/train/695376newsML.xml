<p>Some market analysts may be seeing signs of a short-term top in U.S. stocks, but options investors are not playing along just yet, traders said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's still strong demand for calls,&quot; said Jack Callahan, an independent market maker in S&amp;P 100 index .OEX options. He added that put buying was not extremely heavy.</p>
<p>Investors would likely buy puts for downside protection.</p>
<p>By midday, put volume in the OEX led call volume by 24,876 to 16,507, but that was not necessarily all put buying. The spot OEX index was down about a point at 863.  </p>
<p>The OEX had reached a session low of 856.63.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index .SPX was down 1.19 at about 886 after falling to 879.82 and September S&amp;P 500 futures fell three points to 893.90. They reached 886.</p>
<p>The Dow industrial average was off 11 at about 7,677, off its 7,612 session low.</p>
<p>High bullishness and the failure of major indexes to crack key levels suggested to some analysts the market may be set for a correction.  </p>
<p>Bernie Schaeffer, president of Cincinnati-based Investment Research Institute, said in a report the S&amp;P 500 had reached &quot;maximum overbought levels,&quot; which are a sign of vulnerability.</p>
<p>He added that additional vulnerability was indicated by the failure of S&amp;P 500 futures to hold above the 900 level.</p>
<p>&quot;Round numbers on optionable indices have often served as resistance levels in the bull market of the 1990s, particularly when accompanied -- as is the case right now -- by a buildup of call option open interest at those round number strikes,&quot; Schaeffer said.  </p>
<p>In addition, he said a high level of investor optimism was also a reason for caution.</p>
<p>Schaeffer said he doubted short sellers or put option buyers would have much chance to profit from any correction because pullbacks should be &quot;brief and contained well within the parameters of the long-term uptrend.&quot;</p>
<p>But Richard Scarlata, editor of the Sutton Advisory Letter, said in a report that important tops are now in place in most major stock indexes &quot;and investors can expect at least a 20 percent correction over the next four months.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;July will be a cruel month for U.S. stocks,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In terms of market activity Monday, Callahan said trading was on the quiet side as investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting meeting Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to be on a watch here the next day or two,&quot; he said. &quot;I imagine we'll tread water.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that when the market turned lower in mid-morning after early strength, put sellers turned into put buyers.</p>
