<headline>Capital Corp down after profit warning.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-08</dateline>

<p>Shares in Capital Corp. Plc dropped on Wednesday after the casino operator warned of a sharp fall in profits in 1996.</p>
<p>The stock was down 11-1/2p at 148-1/2 by 1451 GMT, after earlier dropping as low as 140p, its lowest since May 1995.  </p>
<p>In a statement, the operator of the Colony Club and Crockfords casinos in the upmarket Mayfair area of central London said profits had been hit by low levels of &quot;high roller&quot; activity during the final quarter of the year.</p>
<p>Punters at the casinos had also enjoyed a higher-than-usual level of wins in December, Capital said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately December went against us,&quot; Capital's chief executive Alan Hearn told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Capital added that profits would be hit by costs of 2.5 million stg during the closure of the Colony for refurbishment, coupled with other costs for consultancy reviews, redundancy payments and higher than expected startup costs for the Colony.</p>
<p>It said 1996 pre-tax profit would range between 8.5 million stg and 9.0 million.</p>
<p>&quot;1996 has been a year of transition from one club operation to a business with a wider appeal and initial activity levels at the Colony Club have exceeded expectations,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying strength and quality of the group's business continue.&quot;</p>
