<p>Republican congressional leaders said Tuesday they plan to pass by July 4 legislation to curb Medicare spending and make cuts in other domestic programs and separate legislation to enact $85 billion in net tax cuts.</p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other Republicans spoke with reporters after a closed discussion on the next course of action following general agreement with the White House on the balanced budget. &quot;We are setting a very ambitious goal,&quot; Gingrich told reporters. They hope the budget resolution itself will be passed by May 23.  </p>
<p>Gingrich said the gross tax cut figure of $135 billion over five years, or $350 billion over 10 years, would enable Congress to approve a cut in the capital gains tax rate, a permanent $500 per child tax credit, reductions in inheritance taxes as well as education tax credits sought by President Clinton.</p>
<p>The Senate Budget Committee could start writing the fiscal 1998  budget resolution Tuesday, with action on the Senate floor to follow quickly, chairman Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said. House Budget Committee action will occur around the same time.</p>
<p>Passage of the budget resolution will enable House and Senate Appropriations Committees to start work right away on the 13  regular spending bills needed to keep the government running past the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>Domenici told reporters he expected the budget would clear the Senate easily since it will be offered by both himself and the senior committee Democrat Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. &quot;For those who want to talk, we are going to give them plenty of time to talk, but just how much can they when the overwhelming percentage of people are already on board,&quot; he said.</p>
