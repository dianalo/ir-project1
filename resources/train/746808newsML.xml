<p>Music and movies group PolyGram NV said on Tuesday the strategy at its film unit, which earlier announced increased first half operating losses, was developing as planned to break even in 1998 or 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Film strategy is on target. We always said 1997 would be a year of transition. There's nothing there to worry about,&quot; PolyGram chief executive Alain Levy said in a phone interview, following half year results.</p>
<p>&quot;We say 1998-99 for operating profit from film,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Group profit at PolyGram in the first half was down 0.7 percent to 270 million guilders, with a strong performance at music offset by operating losses at film which leapt to 92 million guilders from 37 million in the half.</p>
<p>Levy said the film performance had been affected by the lack of releases in the second quarter and by currency movements, with the strong dollar magnifying losses. Underperformance of &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; and &quot;Gridlock'd&quot; hurt the first quarter.</p>
<p>Asked about the prospects for the second half Levy was positive. &quot;We're certainly not expecting a repeat in the second half of the first half as far as movies are concerned,&quot; he said.    </p>
<p>Levy said PolyGram had a slate of around 12 movies to release later in the year, including &quot;The Game&quot; starring Michael Douglas, the firm's first major issue via its distribution arm.</p>
<p>&quot;It will probably will go to around 2,000 or more screens. In the U.S. we've had nothing approaching that,&quot; said Levy, adding, &quot;This is our first major release. We've seen the movie and we have great aspirations for it.&quot;</p>
<p>PolyGram is also looking for returns from other new films and for video follow up to previously released films. &quot;Into next year we have a fairly strong slate and also the follow up of what was released in the first half,&quot; he said. --Keiron Henderson, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
