<p>Swiss business conditions in the 1997 first quarter worsened in most sectors and while signs of recovery were seen in the current quarter, broad economic growth was not expected before the third, the Swiss Institute for Business Cycle Research (KOF) said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the second quarter, signs of a recovery are recognisable,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>But based on individual results, as well as the reading for the KOF's overall economic index, &quot;modest growth is only likely beginning in the third quarter of 1997,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>KOF said a poll of some 6,000 companies also showed that a downward trend for incoming orders, orders on hand and production continued at a slower pace.</p>
<p>It also said that capacity use rose slightly to 83.6 percnt, due mainly to a reduction of production capacity.</p>
<p>Swiss building sector conditions were determined to be poor, although the drop in business activity had slowed, and expectations were for continued price declines in the near-term.</p>
<p>Retail sales were steady at the unsatisfactory levels seen in earlier months and profitability also worsened, the report said.</p>
