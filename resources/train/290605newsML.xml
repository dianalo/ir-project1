<p>Serbian pro-democracy protesters have turned the charm on security forces policing their daily rallies, hoping to win them over and avert any government crackdown.</p>
<p>Some 30,000 protesters marking Orthodox Christmas Day with their 51st consecutive rally on Tuesday kissed police and wished them a merry Christmas after opposition leaders called for a charm offensive to woo them to their cause.</p>
<p>Police who let hundreds of thousands of protesters march unhindered to St Sava cathedral on Monday for midnight mass in their biggest protest yet were back in force on Tuesday, keeping the rally within a few streets around Republic Square.</p>
<p>The protesters responded with kisses -- on cheeks or on the visors of riot helmets. One opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, walked along the police cordon, wishing them a merry Christmas.</p>
<p>Diplomats say President Slobodan Milosevic's authority is crumbling and he could be forced to crack down after the Christmas and New Year holidays.</p>
<p>When Belgrade returns to work on Wednesday, the opposition plans a telephone campaign to jam the switchboards of government offices. One announcer at the rally said the daily Democratija would publish lists of telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Draskovic asked protesters to head into the city on foot and in cars on Wednesday. A car protest last Sunday got round the ban on marches and turned Belgrade into a vast traffic jam.</p>
<p>Draskovic described the heavy police presence as an unprecedented insult to the spirit of Christmas.</p>
<p>&quot;You men in police uniforms are also a part of our people, it is also your Christmas, not only ours,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Not even when the Turks ruled Serbia was anything like this ever seen. The Turkish Pasha of Belgrade never sent troops against the Serb people to prevent them from celebrating their religious holidays. Not even the Communist regime of Josip Broz Tito ever deployed police in the streets at Christmas.&quot;</p>
<p>The Orthodox church celebrates Christmas on January 7 under the old Julian calendar, which predated the Gregorian calendar introduced by Pope Gregory in the late 16th century.</p>
<p>Protests began after the authorities annulled results of local elections in November which gave the opposition control of 15 of the biggest towns in Serbia, including Belgrade.</p>
<p>The opposition also blames the government for a flood of dinars on the black market, which has brought the local currency down from 3.8 to the mark last week to 4.3 on Tuesday. It says the state is printing money to pay police wage arrears.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Yugoslav Left (JUL) party led by Milosevic's wife Mirjana Markovic said a bomb had been thrown at its headquarters, causing damage but no injuries.</p>
<p>Zajedno leaders denied involvement. Draskovic said the bombing had been staged to provoke a state of emergency.</p>
<p>In another potential blow to Milosevic's authority, the speaker of the Montenegrin parliament, Svetozar Marovic, said events in Serbia were causing extensive damage to Yugoslavia, which is made up of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
<p>Unless a democratic solution was found urgently, &quot;Montenegro would have to think seriously about its next moves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tiny Montenegro has pursued a vigorous privatisation programme. Some businessmen say Montenegro would fare better alone without sharing the international disapproval of Serbia.</p>
<p>An inquiry by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has confirmed the opposition claims that it was robbed of election victories.</p>
<p>Serbia's Socialist government grudgingly admitted last week that Zajedno prevailed in a few of the smaller cities but insisted that in other districts no party gained a majority or the results were inconclusive and needed further study.</p>
