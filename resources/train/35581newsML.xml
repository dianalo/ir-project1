<title>USA: Farberware plant operations to be suspended.</title>
<headline>Farberware plant operations to be suspended.</headline>

<p>Operations at a South Bronx Farberware plant are expected to be suspended if a contract is not extended between US Industries Inc and Syratech Corp.</p>
<p>Syratech, which owns Farberware housewares and the equipment at the plant, has a manufacturing agreement that expires September 6 with US Industries, the previous owner of Farberware, US Industries said. US Industries had an agreement with the Empire State Development Corp to maintain operations at the 700-employee plant, said Empire State Development, which holds a lease agreement with U.S. Industries.</p>
<p>US Industries vice president of investor relations Diana Burton said the company made a good faith effort to keep the plant open, but Syratech had not made a contract offer that was economically viable for U.S. Industries to stay on.</p>
<p>US Industries would like to continue manufacturing at the plant, or help find a new manufacturer, but it would like Syratech and the local government to help, Burton said.</p>
<p>Syratech was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Empire State Development said it has several investors interested in the plant and it would pursue legal remedies if the plant ceases operations.</p>
