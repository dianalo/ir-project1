<title>JAPAN: INSIGHT - JGBs may be volatile, watching events.</title>
<headline>INSIGHT - JGBs may be volatile, watching events.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-07-30</dateline>

<p>Japanese government bonds (JGBs) have the potential to move relatively widely in Tokyo on Wednesday, but activity is likely to be determined mainly by industrial production data due out at 0430 GMT and the expected announcement of administrative penalties for Nomura Securities and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), traders said.</p>
<p>The time of the expected penalty announcement by the Ministry of Finance is not yet known, but the market is watching it closely.</p>
<p>Traders said the most immediate impact of this on the bond market will depend on how stocks respond.  </p>
<p>Should closely-watched June industrial production fall by more than 3.0-4.0 percent, traders said bond buying could ensue, and that the key September futures contract could rise well above 126.00 should this happen.</p>
<p>But predictions for July and August figures are expected to be even more closely watched, although the market has been unable to reach a consensus on these.</p>
<p>Although sentiment remains firm overall, the dollar's rise to around 118.45 yen may keep the topside heavy. Light support is expected at 125.65 and then, more solidly, at 125.50, with resistance near 126.10.</p>
