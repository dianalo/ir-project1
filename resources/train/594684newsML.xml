<headline>U.S.'s Daley warns Argentina to improve patent law.</headline>

<p>U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley was quoted Monday as saying Argentina has made some advances over patents but warning that investments to the country would be limited if firms felt unprotected.</p>
<p>&quot;You will not get investments in this country if companies believe their rights will be robbed,&quot; Daley said in an interview with La Nacion Newspaper.  </p>
<p>&quot;The government has made some progress but we have insistently reaffirmed that investments will not flow to this country if companies believe they will not have enough protection for products on which they spent huge amounts of money in research and development.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has charged it loses some $540 million a year because Argentine companies allegedly copy their products without paying royalties.  </p>
<p>Daley, who spoke to La Nacion before departing to Chile after a 48 hour official visit to Argentina, said patent laws will not only put in jeopardy U.S. investments in Argentina but also those from other countries.  He added there was also great U.S. concern about software piracy in Argentina.</p>
<p>He said Brazil has introduced good patent laws and hence &quot;will get some $2.0 billion in investments.&quot;</p>
<p>On the positive side, Daley praised Argentina's telecommunications sector.</p>
<p>&quot;What I heard (from U.S. telecommunications companies) is that they feel the process going on in Argentina is fair, very open, very public, very transparent...I understand there is work going on to make it more open and competitive.  I heard not a single complaint from American companies about this.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked by La Nacion about Argentine plans to privatize dozens of national or provincial airports, Daley said the program &quot;to privatize 30 to 35 airports in a single block is &quot;more than ambitious.&quot;</p>
