<p>Medical device company Healthdyne Technologies Inc., which is fighting a hostile takeover by Invacare Corp., will be able to attract new suitors starting Thursday when it is released from federal accounting rules that restrict transactions.</p>
<p>Although Healthdyne Technologies repeatedly has said it is not for sale, industry experts said potential &quot;white knights&quot; may emerge with a stock bid above Invacare's cash offer of $180 million, or $13.50 per share.</p>
<p>Beginning Thursday, Healthdyne Technologies can enter a tax-free pooling transaction -- an accounting method that is considered much more appealing to buyers than the purchase accounting method. Buyers involved in pooling transactions typically report higher earnings than those involved in purchase transactions, which often dilute earnings.</p>
<p>But firms doing stock deals can only pursue a pooling if both companies in a transaction have been independent for two years. Marietta, Ga.-based Healthdyne Technologies was spun off from Healthdyne Inc. on May 22, 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously with a pooling, it's a better transaction,&quot; said Matthew Dodds, analyst at Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc.</p>
<p>The issue of pooling may not be overly important to rumored buyers Siemens AG of Germany and Britain's BOC Group Plc. Foreign companies generally do not suffer earnings dilution from purchase accounting transactions.</p>
<p>Although some companies previously have been permitted to do a pooling transaction before the deadline, the expiration of the two years will be comforting to prospective bidders, industry experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Before, there may have been some fear about a pooling, but as of Thursday that will be removed,&quot; said one trader who follows takeover stocks.</p>
<p>Healthdyne Technologies Chief Financial Officer Wayne Boylston confirmed the company becomes eligible for a pooling transaction on Thursday, but noted the board of directors has said it is not pursuing a sale.</p>
<p>&quot;As of right now, the company's position has not changed,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>A U.S. spokesman for Siemens declined to comment on a potential bid for Healthdyne Technologies, noting the company has said it would make acquisitions or divest properties based on its needs.</p>
<p>BOC Group's U.S. Ohmeda unit said it is exploring strategic alliances with companies that have complementary technologies, including Healthyne Technologies. It did not comment on whether it would seek to buy Healthdyne Technologies.</p>
<p>Invacare, based in Elyria, Ohio, said the pooling eligibility does not change its plans. Invacare launched an unsolicited $12.50 per share bid for Healthdyne Technologies in January and raised the offer twice.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been aware of this for a long time. It doesn't really change our strategy. If they do decide to sell and they want to do a pooling, we'd throw our hat into the ring,&quot; said Invacare Chief Executive Officer Malachi Mixon.</p>
<p>Healthdyne Technologies repeatedly has said the offer was inadeqaute and is not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders.</p>
<p>Shares of Healthdyne Technologies rose 6.25 cents to $14.675 on Nasdaq Wednesday. Invacare stock fell 56 cents to $22.44, also on Nasdaq.</p>
