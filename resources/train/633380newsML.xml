<p>Polish fixed bond yields are expected to hold relatively flat at Wednesday's primary tender but could ease if foreign investors are active at the auction.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the treasury offers a joint 800 million zloty tender of 15-percent two-year and 12-percent five-year bonds.</p>
<p>Analysts said it was not clear if foreign investors would purchase large amounts of Polish bonds after the Czech crown's recent tumble caused many to cut positions in potentially volatile local-currency papers in Central Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is far from clear but foreign investors seem to be somewhat cooler on taking new positions in Polish paper after some were burned by the Czech crown's fall,&quot; said Piotr Korcz, dealer at Bank Handlowy.</p>
<p>But analysts said that better Polish fundementals should keep foreign investors interested in Polish fixed bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand could be generated on Wednesday as foreigners who refrained from buying T-bills at Monday's auction bid for fixed bonds,&quot; said Robert Gluch, dealer at ING bank in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Analysts said these bonds were a good investment given their high yields and relative liquidity in secondary trade.</p>
<p>They said the shorter bonds yield should be between 21.05 and 21.15 percent, against 21.15 percent average yield at the last tender of similar bonds on May 7.</p>
<p>The average yield on the longer bonds should be relatively flat and remain between 18.45 and 18.50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors will focus on the two-year paper, and yields could fall by some 10 basis points depending on demand,&quot; said Marcin Rzechowski, senior dealer at PBI SA.</p>
<p>The ministry could sell some 550-600 million zlotys of the two-year bonds, maturing on October 12, 1999, and up to 250 million of the five-year paper, due on October 12, 2002.</p>
<p>The value date for the tender is June 12, 1997. Investors may place bids at the tender until 1100 local time (0900 GMT).</p>
