<headline>Base metals sparkle on LME as autumn approaches.</headline>

<p>Base metal prices woke up from a month-long slumber on the London Metal Exchange (LME) as the last trading day of the month heralded upside breaks in several metals, traders said.</p>
<p>Copper finally cleared $1,970 a tonne, the ceiling of the one-month $70 trading range in which prices have stagnated, with the market then moving rapidly above $2,000 to hit $2,035 a tonne. On Thursday, prices closed at $1,959.</p>
<p>Heavy short-covering from one quarter was triggered by the upside break, with prices now at their highest since June 20. Inevitably, other metals were pulled higher in copper's wake.</p>
<p>&quot;It is about time too - it's been an awful month for copper with the price going nowhere fast,&quot; one floor trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of positive factors are coming together - strikes, tightness, and the end of the summer slowdown,&quot; another added.</p>
<p>Clearing $1,970 proved to be a catalyst for copper, as buy-stops, short-covering and pent-up buying interest confirmed the advance. Support for the move emanated from tightening spreads as several crunch dates in September draw close.</p>
<p>Also, Friday's 3,600-tonne increase in warehouse stocks was much lower than anticipated, while an strike at Codelco's Salvador mine and the ongoing stoppage at Gold Fields Namibia's Tsumeb smelter highlighted the market's vulnerability to supply-side disruptions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cash/threes backwardation menacingly widened to $65, reflecting tightness in early September to the third Wednesday prompt date - a period of time when the selling linked to the Sumitomo revelations in June becomes cash, traders noted.</p>
<p>&quot;It (September tightness) has been well publicised, but you still get shorts hanging on to the last minute, so some of these dates could flare up sharply,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>While the short term picture looked bullish, some analysts were more cautious for the longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;This was primarily a technically-based move with (buy) stops being triggered,&quot; said Karen Norton, analyst at LME brokers Billiton Metals.</p>
<p>&quot;But we are sticking to our view that further ahead supply will continue to build and outweigh demand,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the end of the summer brought long-awaited price movement for aluminium, which rose above $1,500 to $1,515. Lead, additionally bolstered by the stoppage at Tsumeb where there is a lead smelter, rose to $812.</p>
<p>Zinc received positive news on Thursday of lower output at Noranda's Brunswick facilities, and traded up to $1,035.</p>
<p>And a strike mandate at Inco's Manitoba operations ahead of a mid-September contract expiry carried nickel to $7,570.</p>
<p>Tin joined in the move, and rose above $6,300 at one stage.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not go so far as to say &quot;happy days are here again', but it is looking a bit better as we go into the last quarter,&quot; a trader added. --London Newsroom 44 171 542 8080</p>
