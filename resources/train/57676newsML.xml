<p>According to Morris Goldstein, an IMF economist, the most important of seven danger signals to watch for in anticipating a balance-of-payments crisis is the mismatch between short-term debt and foreign reserves.</p>
<p>This, above all, was the reason for Mexico's crisis in that, at the time, only 20 percent of its short-term foreign debt was covered by its foreign exchange reserves and there was doubt in the minds of investors that trade debt could be met.</p>
<p>The other signals are the relative size of the current account deficit; the investment or consumption origin of the deficit; whether foreign investment is in the form of direct investment or portfolio investment; whether the exchange rate is overvalued; and the growth of money supply.</p>
<p>In a most fundamental sense the rapid rise of short-term indebtedness and an inadequate foreign reserve defence to match these liabilities was the cause of the 1985 Standstill crisis.</p>
<p>According to the Bank of International Settlements' periodic reports the claims on South Africa of the reporting banks in the developed countries rose from $9.9 billion at the end of 1981, to $13.1 billion at the end of 1982, and $15.1 billion rand at the end of 1983.</p>
<p>The position at the end of 1984 was $16.7 billion and at the time of the crisis $17.2 billion.</p>
<p>The crisis occurred in September that year and at the end of August 1985 the foreign reserves of the South African Reserve Bank, including gold holdings, amounted to $2.35 billion rand or only 13.7 percent of the foreign banks' claims on South Africa.</p>
<p>The percentage would have been even lower were also taken into account loans maturing within 12 months and the short-term inter-company indebtedness between foreign subsidiaries in South Africa and their parent companies abroad.</p>
<p>Apparently, at the time, the Bank of International Settlements was expressing increasing concern about the soaring short-term indebtedness of South Africa. Not only were the American and British banks becoming restive about what amounted to a poor country risk assessment of South Africa, but this was the opportune time for American banks, subject to extreme anti-apartheid pressure on the streets, to blow the whistle on South Africa.</p>
<p>It was also significant that there was no local public awareness of the danger because of the absence, at that time, of any official maturity analysis of foreign debt.</p>
<p>Even now the short-term debt risk is difficult to assess because the Reserve Bank's published maturity analysis is confined to foreign-currency-denominated debt, thus excluding the rand-denominated short-term debt.</p>
<p>A recent report of the Bank of International Settlements shows that foreign banks claims on South Africa at the end of 1995 amounted to $15.1 billion, having increased sharply from $13.3 billion at the end of 1994 because of the considerable overseas funding of soaring imports in 1995. However, the foreign banks' claims include standstill debt which has become subject to long-term redemption arrangements and, therefore, cannot be taken as a measure of short-term indebtedness.</p>
<p>We have to turn to a domestic source, namely the Reserve Bank's Quarterly Bulletin, to establish a figure. According to the June issue, the short-term foreign liabilities of the banking sector amounted to 23.3 billion rand at the end of December, but there was an additional 9.7 billion rand foreign finance raised by banks on behalf of clients.</p>
<p>Including the foreign deposits with the Corporation for Public Deposits the total short-term debt can be put at 33.8 billion rand, or $9.3 billion, at the end of 1995, but with $2.8 billion maturities in 1996 the total short-term position amounts to $12.1 billion. This still leaves out an inter-company indebtedness.</p>
<p>With the Reserve Bank's foreign assets at the end of 1995 amounting to $4.5 billion the reserves/short-term liability cover is 36.8 percent. Here we have given the reserves their full 100 percent value, instead of the 90 percent of the last ten fixes for the valuation of gold holdings as is the custom of the Bank.</p>
<p>However, should the foreign balances of the banks be included the total foreign reserve position is improved to $5.1 billion and the cover to 42.5 percent.</p>
<p>This compares favourably with Mexico's 20 percent at the time of her crisis, but not at all favourably against other emerging countries, such as Malaysia with 186 percent cover, South Korea with 147 percent cover and Thailand with 109 percent cover.</p>
<p>Foreign banks would have sensed the deteriorating country risk as reflected in the foreign reserve cover for South Africa and began to force a reversal of the short-term position during the course of 1996. Indeed the Reserve Bank estimated that there was a net outflow on short-term capital account of 4.3 billion rand in the first quarter of 1996, which almost completely negated the net long-term capital inflows.</p>
<p>This exposed the foreign reserves to the full impact of the current account deficit and, as a result, the foreign reserves declined by 2.2 billion rand in the quarter. Also the currency took its first dive from 3.65 against the dollar to 3.95 against the dollar.</p>
<p>The pattern is likely to have repeated itself in the second quarter. Although foreign reserves continued to fall there would have been a sharp reduction in short-term liabilities, leaving the cover in the region of 40 percent.</p>
<p>We continue to live dangerously and remain vulnerable to any show of foreign displeasure or weakening of confidence. Net purchases of JSE securities are helping to prop up the currency and slow down the erosion of reserves.</p>
