<p>Moscow on Wednesday blamed its own military for forcing an airliner carrying Chechnya's vice-president to abort a flight abroad and issued what amounted to an apology for the incident, suggesting it was a provocation.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that some Russian state officials did not fulfil their functions accurately,&quot; Kremlin Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin said on the Ekho Moskvy radio station after speaking by telephone to Chechen officials.</p>
<p>The statement came as the Chechen government met in emergency session to discuss the incident, which it called a &quot;gross violation&quot; of a treaty signed just a week ago with Moscow aimed at normalising relations after a 21-month conflict.</p>
<p>Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov said afterwards the authorities had accepted an apology from Moscow and vice-president Vakha Arsanov, whose plane was intercepted, had dropped his call for Russian officials to leave Chechnya.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chechen side accepted an official apology from Russian Security Council Secreterary Ivan Rybkin for the incident and cancelled vice-president Arsanov's order to expel federal representatives from Chechen territory,&quot; Udugov told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider the incident over,&quot; Udugov said. Reporters in Grozny, the Chechen capital, said Arsanov took off on Wednesday for the Netherlands, destination of his aborted journey the previous day.</p>
<p>Two Russian fighter jets accompanied it 250 km (150 miles) back to the frontier on Tuesday after he refused an order by Russian radio operators to land in a southern Russian town, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Although Rybkin did not use the word apology, it was clear Russian officials were trying to calm tensions over the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;It stems to a great extent from the fact that one can see a lazy unwillingness on the part of some officials to take on board the agreement on peace and principles of interrelations between Chechnya and Russia,&quot; Rybkin told Ekho Moskvy.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result we have something close to what one might call a provocation,&quot; Rybkin said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed an order to ensure that senior Chechen officials be allowed to fly direct from the Chechen capital Grozny, Rybkin's spokesman Igor Ignatyev told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>The Chechens -- and Russian liberals -- have regularly complained that there is a &quot;party of war&quot; in Moscow which wants to prolong the conflict, which broke out after Yeltsin sent troops to crush the separatists in December 1994.</p>
<p>Fighting ended last August after tens of thousands died, and Russian troops withdrew from the breakaway region, which elected a new leadership in January.</p>
<p>Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov and Yeltsin finally signed what is intended to be a lasting peace treaty in Moscow on May 12. Both pledged it would end four centuries of conflict.</p>
<p>While Yeltsin went a long way to recognising the Chechens' autonomy and Russia agreed to start helping to rebuild the region's shattered economy, the treaty left open the vexed issue of whether Chechnya will ever be an independent sovereign state.</p>
<p>This is Maskhadov's aim, although he has promised never to resort to force and has ordered Chechnya's irregular guerrilla groups to disband, thus limiting his armed forces.</p>
<p>Yeltsin refuses to countenance full independence. Some Russian nationalists feel he has already gone too far.</p>
