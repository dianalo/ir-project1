<p>General Mills Inc said Thursday the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal category grew by one percent during fiscal 1997 in all outlets.</p>
<p>This compares with an historic growth rate for cereal of three percent.</p>
<p>General Mills blamed the slower growth rate on reduced marketing spending by Big G and other major branded cereal companies.</p>
<p>General Mills said its Big G cereal division's market share grew &quot;slightly&quot; to 23.4 percent, led by new brands like French Toast Crunch and Team Cheerios.  </p>
<p>Including the Chex and Cookie Crisp brands acquired from Ralcorp Holdings Inc earlier this year, General Mills' total cereal share was more than 26 percent.</p>
<p>General Mills is the second largest U.S. cereal maker behind leader Kellogg Co.</p>
<p>Big G cereal volume excluding the acquired Ralcorp brands grew nearly three percent in 1997. Including those brands, growth was four percent.</p>
<p>Total Big G sales of $2.2 billion were even with prior-year results, while earnings were lower as reductions in marketing spending only partially offset price declines.  </p>
<p>General Mills and other major cereal companies cut list prices last year.</p>
<p>Overall, General Mills said its U.S. unit volume for established domestic businesses grew three percent in fiscal 1997. The acquired Ralcorp brands boosted total U.S. volume growth to more than four percent.</p>
<p>General Mills said snacks volume grew five percent in 1997, including a seven percent increase in the second half of the year. Including results for the acquired Chex Mix snacks line, 1997 snacks volume rose nine percent.</p>
<p>Total volume for Betty Crocker dinner and side dish mixes grew four percent, including an eight percent volume increase for the Hamburger Helper line and good performance by a new, three-item line of flavored mashed potato mixes introduced during the year.</p>
<p>Yogurt volume grew 11 percent, while Betty Crocker desserts volume was down two percent from strong prior-year levels. Foodservice operations posted a four percent volume gain for the year.</p>
<p>General Mills said it issued about 5.4 million shares in 1997 in conjunction with the Ralcorp cereal acquisition. Stock repurchases during 1997 totaled 6.2 million shares.</p>
