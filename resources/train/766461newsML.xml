<p>President Bill Clinton called Wednesday's bombing in Jerusalem a barbarous act and pointedly urged Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority to take action to stop such &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks.</p>
<p>In a hastily arranged appearance in the White House press room after 13 people were killed and more than 150 injured in the lunchtime attack at a Jerusalem market, Clinton said he had telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express U.S. condolences.</p>
<p>He also said a visit to the Middle East by U.S. mediator Dennis Ross was being postponed to allow a period of mourning in Israel. Ross had been scheduled to leave for the region on Wednesday evening to convey some U.S. ideas for reinvigorating negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's bombing by terrorists in Jerusalem is a barbarous act. There is no excuse and there must be no tolerance for this kind of inhumanity,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;The slaughter was aimed directly at innocent Israelis and, make no mistake, it was also aimed at the majority of Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs who want a lasting and just peace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only answer can and must be concrete steps by the Palestinian Authority to increase security operations and the strengthening of security cooperation between Palestinians and Israelis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms harshly criticised Arafat, saying he had not done enough to stop terrorism in the areas under his control. The North Carolina Republican called on the Senate to pass a resolution condemning the attack.</p>
<p>Clinton, asked what the Palestinians could have done to prevent the attack, which was apparently carried out by two suicide bombers, said: &quot;Well, I can't answer that, but I do know there have been long periods when the security operations have succeeded.&quot;</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters later that the United States had not made a judgment on who was responsible &quot;nor I believe have we received any word from the Israeli government on their assesment.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if any Americans were among the casualties, McCurry said: &quot;We are still working through with the Israeli government to answer that question. I'm not aware of any at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>Ross had been planning to convey U.S. ideas for restoring momentum to the Middle East peace process. Clinton declined to shed any light on these ideas, but said the the envoy's trip would be postponed &quot;for an appropriate period.&quot;</p>
<p>The president also strongly denied that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's conspicuous absence from the region since taking office more than six months ago reflected any lessening of his personal interest in the peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;My personal involvement has been continuing and intense in this,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;You should not conclude for a moment that the White House has not been intimately and intensely and continuously involved in this peace process, particularly as it has gotten more difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli ambassador Eliahu Ben-Elissar, speaking to journalists after meeting Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, said he hoped negotiations would resume.</p>
<p>He called on Arafat to arrest leaders of the Moslem militant group Hamas who he said had been &quot;inciting and advocating this kind of operations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What we have witnessed till now is that the Palestinian Authority has sometimes arrested and very quickly afterwards set free leaders of the Hamas and some of their operators,&quot; Ben-Elissar said.</p>
<p>The United States must make clear to Arafat that security cooperation with Israel cannot be conditional on political decisions or &quot;anything related to the peace process,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, the best thing that can happen is to have the negotiations on the permanent status start as quickly as possible. Actually, this is what we are expecting from Yasser Arafat, and from the United States to make absolutely clear to Yasser Arafat,&quot; he said.</p>
