<p>Mauritius does not see the Lome Sugar Protocol on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation's first ministerial meeting, to be held in Singapore in December.</p>
<p>Mauritian Agriculture Minister Arvin Boolell told Reuters he saw no reason for a discussion on the protocol, which gives sugar exports from the group of 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific states preferential access to European Union markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should it be? The Sugar Protocol is GATT-compatible,&quot; Boolell said in an interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>He was responding to a recent position paper from the International Policy Council (IPC) on Agriculture, Food and Trade, a Washington-based global think-tank, which called upon WTO members to agree on starting discussions on &quot;a timetable and basis for multilateral reform of global sugar and dairy policies&quot; during the Singapore meeting.</p>
<p>In Geneva last month, the IPC urged member countries to move towards formal agreements bringing the highly protected industry under free trade rules.</p>
<p>Under the Sugar Protocol, sugar-producing ACP states enjoy annual guaranteed export quotas of some 1.3 million tonnes to EU markets at preferential prices. It was set up in 1975 along with the Lome Convention and one of the Protocol's characteristics is its indefinite duration.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Sugar Protocol document, it is stated that indefinite period was understood by the ACP and the European states as being of permanent nature,&quot; Boolell, who is also the ACP ministerial spokesman for sugar, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Under the protocol, Mauritius is the largest ACP sugar supplier to the EU markets with an annual quota of 508,000 tonnes. Sugar accounts for around 25 percent of the island's total exports each year and is its largest hard currency earner in terms of net value added.</p>
<p>Boolell cited aspects of the Protocol which make it compatible with GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), &quot;First of all, it has a multilateral dimension, that is, it embraces as many countries as possible. The Protocol is also environment-friendly.&quot;</p>
<p>IPC sugar specialist Michael Franklin said in Geneva, &quot;The sugar market is riddled with distortions because of protection, including export subsidies and quotas, and a more rational and liberalised system would bring huge benefit to the world economy.&quot;</p>
<p>Franklin said barriers to imports in the European Union, the U.S. and Japan kept out sugar from efficient producers in many developing countries.</p>
<p>But Boolell said proponents of complete free trade were backed by countries that had vast internal sugar markets and used proceeds from internal sales to support their exports.</p>
<p>&quot;These countries also manufacture agricultural equipment, fertilisers, have diversified economies and are blessed with very fertile soil. So their cost of production is very low.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the proponents had yet to prove there would be a level playing field in a completely deregulated world trade environment for sugar. &quot;There would be more price distortions favouring countries with more diversified economies,&quot; he said.</p>
