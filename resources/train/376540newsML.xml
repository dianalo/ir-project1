<p>A Turkish security court on Thursday charged an Islamist former mayor with serious public order offences for organising an anti-Israeli protest, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>The court accused Bekir Yildiz, a member of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party, of &quot;aiding and abetting an armed gang&quot; and &quot;provoking hatred by showing differences of region, class, religion, denomination or race&quot;, it said.</p>
<p>He could be jailed for between four and eight years.</p>
<p>The interior ministry removed Yildiz as mayor after his council in the central town of Sincan staged a pro-Palestinian &quot;Jerusalem Night&quot; late last month to protest against Israel.</p>
<p>The semi-official agency did not say with which armed gang Yildiz is allegedly linked. In Turkey, the accusation of aiding illegal groups is a catch-all charge often used against civilians suspected of militant Islamist or Kurdish sentiment.</p>
<p>Nine others who took part in the protest were charged with similar offences.</p>
<p>Yildiz and Iranian ambassador Ali Reza Bagheri spoke on a stage draped with a banner of the late leader of the militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad.</p>
<p>Turkey's opposition parties have accused Yildiz of making a speech in favour of turning officially secular Turkey into an Islamic state.</p>
<p>Tanks toured Sincan several days after the Jerusalem protest in an apparent warning to Islamists from the strictly secularist army. Erbakan, under pressure from the military, has toned down his rhetoric since becoming Turkey's first Islamist prime minister last June.</p>
