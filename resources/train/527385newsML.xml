<headline>Banks may have four options on gold reserves - UBS.</headline>

<p>The world's central banks could consider four ways of activating their gold reserves to make money from them, according to a report by Union Bank of Switzerland bullion market analyst Andy Smith.</p>
<p>Not all would mean flattening the gold price which has been crushed lately by fear of central bank selling.</p>
<p>The banks hold 28,000 tonnes of gold, holdings that are being questioned by those who look at the cost of keeping them and at gold's decreasing monetary role, Smith said in his study entitled Central Bank Gold: The Picture of Less Reserve.</p>
<p>&quot;European Monetary Union...is focusing official minds on the weight of historical baggage about gold still carried by many,&quot; Smith said .</p>
<p>His scenarios were  (1) Reverting to the gold standard by backing currencies with gold (2) Disposing of reserves through auctions (3) For banks to be more deeply involved in gold trading and (4) Uncoordinated sales over a long and damaging period for the market, as happened with silver 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Most of the gold held by the banks was inherited by the current generation of central bankers.</p>
<p>&quot;The official attachment to gold has little to do with gold's advantages as a medium of exchange,&quot; Smith said. He cited the 1978 second amendment to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) articles of agreement which ended a requirement for the IMF or the central banks having to accept gold as payment.</p>
<p>Central bankers have become more skilled at using foreign exchange and security instruments which, Smith argues, could become reserve assets in their own right.</p>
<p>Some central bankers have argued that holding gold is an insurance against financial catastrophe but Smith estimated the cost in foregone interest income of holding gold amounts to $15 billion annually.</p>
<p>The current distribution of official bullion holdings reflected the portfolio choice of the early 1960s probably more than the preferred choice at the end of the century.</p>
<p>Smith noted that there was little evidence that the countries without high gold reserves which are mainly in Asia and the Third World were queuing up to rectify that position.</p>
<p>Meanwhile since 1980, central banks of four nations - Canada, Belgium, Netherlands and Russia - have sold 2,200 tonnes between them without financial crisis but with increasing sophistication.</p>
<p>A 100 percent return to the gold standard officially abandoned in 1968 was impossible given the size of existing money supply unless the gold price was raised enormously.</p>
<p>Bankers would have to decide what percentage would be backed, at what price and how much extra gold to purchase.</p>
<p>Selling the reserves through auctions would be risky but not unprecidented - the IMF and US did it in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Given that several major gold holders, the US, Germany, and France among them would almost certainly not take part, only about 2,100 tonnes of gold might be sold say over two years - similar to the tonnage sold by the IMF and United States.</p>
<p>Prices could fall initially but near the end of the auctions speculators could lift prices above pre-cycle levels, he said.</p>
<p>Trading gold by the central banks was a logical extension of their trading in currencies. The South African central bank has developed expertise as a trader and emerging market central banks have shown pragmatisim in gold trading which &quot;could be seen as the way forward for the west,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>There are signs gold's total demonitisation - like silver's 100 years ago - was well under way through pragmatic policies involving gold swaps, lending, options and outright official sales.</p>
<p>If several banks decided to sell gold, market disruption would be inevitable, &quot;It is impossible for all to sell sensitively at once,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>He said that when Germany announced it was demonitising silver over 100 years ago, panic drove the collapse of the silver price down much further than actual sales volume warranted.</p>
