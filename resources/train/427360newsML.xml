<p>At least 50 Lebanese lawyers volunteered on Friday to defend five alleged Japanese Red Army guerrillas charged with offences carrying up to 10-year jail sentences.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the lawyers said the decision was an act of loyalty toward the guerrillas who had stood by Arabs in their struggle against Israel.</p>
<p>All five suspects are on the international wanted list on charges arising from activities of the Japanese Red Army, which in the 1970s staged a string of attacks including plane hijackings and hostage-takings and linked up with the Palestinians in their fight against Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;Our decision to defend Kozo (Okamoto) and his comrades is an act of faithfulness and a return of favour because they stood by us in the past, in our just nationalistic struggle,&quot; Hani Sleiman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The lawyers union later appointed two other lawyers, Farouq Yaghi and Nohad Jabr, to act for the defence at pre-trial investigations due to begin on Saturday, judicial sources said. This was a temporary measure while the suspects decide on their lawyers.</p>
<p>The investigative judge will either order the suspects to stand trial or release them after completing his investigation.</p>
<p>Okamoto, 49, took part in a 1972 shootout at Tel Aviv's Lod airport in which 24 people died and 78 were injured. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel but was released in a Palestinian-Israeli prisoner swap in 1985.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel is still up until this moment shelling our villages, destroying our houses and so it is an act of loyalty to stand by the Japanese here,&quot; Sleiman added.</p>
<p>Beirut Prosecutor Abdallah Bitar charged the five suspects on Thursday with possessing and using forged passports, forging Lebanese government official stamps, entering the country illegally and illegal residence.</p>
<p>Prosecutor General Adnan Addoum said then the charges carried penalties of up to seven years hard labour but lawyers told Reuters on Friday the penalties ranged from five to 10 years.</p>
<p>Investigative Judge Saeed Mirza opened pre-trial investigations on Friday with a suspected Lebanese accomplice of the Japanese detainees, acupuncturist Omayah Abboud, who was charged with helping them commit the offences.</p>
<p>Three other Japanese detainees were released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Addoum identified the five accused as Kozo Okamoto, Masao Adachi, Mariko Yamamoto, Kazuo Tohira and Haruo Wako. Japan says these are the names of Japanese Red Army guerrillas.</p>
