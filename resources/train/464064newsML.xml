<p>Leading UK market research company Taylor Nelson AGB said on Monday it had begun 1997 in encouraging fashion after the sale of its loss-making MRM Distributions unit.</p>
<p>&quot;We have taken several steps to lay the foundations for a stronger, more efficient group,&quot; said chief executive Tony Cowling. &quot;The start of 1997 has been encouraging and we believe the company is well positioned to pursue further opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisition.&quot;</p>
<p>The company reported 1996 pre-tax profit of 5.0 million stg, against 6.5 million in 1995, after a 2.5 million disposal charge.</p>
<p>The MRM Distributions door-to-door business was sold to The Leaflet Company for 710,000 stg. The exceptional charge comes from the write back of 2.9 million stg of goodwill and sales costs of 300,000 stg, mainly from redundancies.</p>
<p>Cowling told Reuters that group margins had improved to 10.7 percent from 9.5 percent.</p>
<p>Taylor Nelson, which has long provided UK television viewing figures in Britain, has won contracts to provide similar services in the Czech Republic, Poland and Israel.</p>
<p>Cowling said the company was developed a new system to monitor viewing in the multi-channel digital age.</p>
<p>Looking at possible acquisitions, Cowling said they would have to have continuous work rather than one-off contracts and provide data which could be syndicated. &quot;The problem is that there are not many of these around,&quot; he said.</p>
