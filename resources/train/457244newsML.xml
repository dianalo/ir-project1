<p>Yemen's Oil Minister Mohammad Said al-Attar said on Thursday his country's oil production was expected to rise to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 1998 from a current average of 385,000 bpd.</p>
<p>Attar said the forecast 1998 production could possibly increase to 450,000 bpd. &quot;The potential is 480,000, we hope.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're very conservative in our figures and we don't want to exaggerate,&quot; the minister told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said oil production in Yemen's Jannah (Block 5) field will rise to 70,000 bpd by the middle of 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect Block 5 to increase production to 52,000 barrels a day in the second half of 1997 from 15,000 now, and then 70,000 by the middle of next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yemen, a relatively small independent producer, currently pumps an average 385,000 bpd, rising to 405,000 bpd in some months, the minister said.</p>
<p>Jannah is Yemen's third-largest field after Marib (Block 18) and Masila (Block 14).</p>
<p>Attar said production in Marib was now 175,000 bpd and in Masila 185,000 bpd. Nimir (Block 4), a small concession to Saudi businessmen of Yemeni origin, produced 2,000-3,000 bpd.</p>
<p>He said 15 oil companies were working in 21 concession blocks. Five of them were productive, the others were still engaged in exploration. He said there were positive results from some of them.</p>
