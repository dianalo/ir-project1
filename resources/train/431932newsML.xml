<p>China and South Korea will discuss this week terms for the departure from Beijing of North Korea's top ideologue holed up in South Korea's mission, Seoul foreign ministry officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said he believed Beijing had ruled out sending Hwang Jang-yop back to North Korea. Hwang arrived in South Korea's consular compound in Beijing seeking asylum on February 12.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't expect Hwang to leave Beijing this week but details of his departure will be discussed this week and could be worked out,&quot; said another ministry official, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand both sides have formed a common stand that a solution must be found as soon as possible,&quot; Lee told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe China has ruled out sending him back to North Korea,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>He added that South Korea still wanted to send Hwang directly to Seoul but would not rule out bringing him to South Korea through a third country.</p>
