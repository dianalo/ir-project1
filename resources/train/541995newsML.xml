<p>Pope John Paul paid tribute on Sunday to the Czechs' victories over political tyranny but warned them not to fall for the deceptions of consumer society.</p>
<p>The 76-year-old Pontiff, who earlier celebrated mass with more than 100,000 people, said at Prague airport at the end of a three-day visit that the Czech Republic's economic advances must be matched by spiritual progress.</p>
<p>He urged Czechs &quot;to give proper importance to economic triumphs, but without succumbing to the deceptive fascination of consumer society&quot;.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul, on his third visit to Prague since the fall of communism in 1989, said Czechs had resisted &quot;an ideological pressure which was among the most ruthless in eastern Europe&quot; and achieved impressive goals of civilisation and progress.</p>
<p>&quot;As I congratulate you on these victories, I exhort you to be particularly careful to promote a matching spiritual progress. Only the full development of a people's moral virtues can ensure the peaceful and harmonious coexistence of all its members,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Polish Pontiff influenced events which contributed to the collapse of communism in eastern Europe but has since often cautioned against the rise of materialism in the region.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic has one of the highest standards of living in the old East bloc but few people ever attend church.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul, who called on Saturday for a revival of religion in the Czech Republic, told the estimated 120,000 worshippers at Sunday's mass that the Czechs' Christian tradition was the guarantor of their future.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Christian history is not over. Your saints are not silent. Your saints are alive. They are the guarantors of your past and of your future,&quot; he told the crowd gathered on a blustery overcast day on Prague's Letna Plain.</p>
<p>The Pope, who has suffered a series of health problems in recent years, spoke in a strong voice from the raised altar platform backed by a huge wooden cross.</p>
<p>With the mass, and another outdoor service in the town of Hradec Kralove on Saturday, Pope John Paul marked the 1,000th anniversary of the death of St Adalbert, a Czech bishop who took the gospel to Poland and other part of central Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a sign of that harmony and cooperation which ought to exist between the church and society. He is a sign of the link between the Czech and Polish nations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul evoked Adalbert, or Vojtech in Czech, in an ecumenical service with Czech church leaders in Prague's St Vitus Cathedral, saying the saint had forged a desire for unity among the peoples of Europe, which was still to be attained.</p>
<p>&quot;The deep wounds opened during the religious history of Europe challenge our consciences. At this moment and in a special way, we are challenged by the divisions which took place in the history of the Czech nation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Czech history is scarred by religious wars beginning after the death at the stake of John Hus, a Bohemian priest whose followers founded an independent Protestant church.</p>
<p>The Pope's last visit to the Czech Republic, in 1995, proved controversial when he canonised Jan Sarkander, a priest tortured to death by Protestants in 1620 but viewed by many Protestants as a traitor.</p>
<p>Czech President Vaclav Havel, who was at the cathedral with other Czech leaders and at the airport as the Pope prepared to leave, told Czech Radio the Pontiff's visit was an inspiration.</p>
<p>&quot;It is always good when we realise through his presence that there is something above us, that there is a world of higher values which it is good to respect,&quot; Havel said.</p>
