<p>The mark shot up on the crosses in Europe as a French call for time to think over the EU stability pact sparked fears the whole EMU project would be delayed.</p>
<p>New finance minister Dominiue Strauss-Kahn said France wanted a period of reflection on the stability pact, which is aimed at enforcing fiscal rigour after EMU begins. France was not seeking to renegotiate the pact, but could not approve it now, he said.</p>
<p>As shock waves reverberated around the markets, officials lined up to insist EMU was still on course for a timely launch in 1999.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's not the end of EMU in itself, but it's not helping,&quot; said Neal Kimberley, manager of the EMS desk at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the thin end of the wedge. If the French want to postpone ratification of the stability pact, it implies they want some changes and they'll want a few months to work out what changes they want,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>German finance minister Theo Waigel, architect of the pact, said he saw no agreement before the June 16-17 Amsterdam summit, when it is due to be sealed. But European Commission President Jacques Santer said he hoped for agreement before Amsterdam.  </p>
<p>While EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy said the French request did not threaten EMU's target start date, the market took it as a cue to bail out of satellite currencies into the hard core of the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;The message is (France and Germany) are struggling to find common ground, and in those circumstances you've got to be looking at unwinding some of these convergence trades,&quot; said Chris Tinker, chief treasury economist at Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>The mark jumped to trade at 988.30/60 Italian lire and 3.3813/15 French francs by 1211 GMT from late Friday's European levels of 986.00/30 and 3.3763/66 respectively.  </p>
<p>The mark had eased slightly on its crosses in early Europe as players seized on weekend assertions from EU finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg that EMU was on track and commitment to its punctual launch had not weakened.</p>
<p>Since the left wing swept to power in the French election on June 1, the market has been plagued with concerns that monetary union will either produce a broad, weak euro or be postponed.</p>
<p>Talk of EMU delay traditionally boosts the mark as investors perceive diminished risk that it will be subsumed into a weaker unit, while fears that the single currency will be broad-based and soft tend to have the opposite effect.  </p>
<p>The French Socialists have made clear their desire to see Spain and Italy included in EMU from the outset.</p>
<p>The Spanish peseta dropped to a session low of 84.78 per mark immediately after the French news. It had had recovered to 84.70/72 by 1224 GMT as peripherals steadied generally, but remained weaker than Friday's European close of 84.57/59.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market would remain extremely nervous this week, especially ahead of Friday's Franco-German summit, but said peripheral currenciess should not suffer too much more until the dust settled on France's move.</p>
<p>Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International, said the rift between France and Germany heightened the chances of EMU delay.</p>
<p>&quot;But I think they still both want to see EMU go ahead on time so any fallout should be seen as an opportunity to buy the peripheral markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>German difficulty in plugging budget holes to qualify for EMU have stoked fears of a soft euro since it makes it harder to argue against the inclusion of states such as Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>The market had been betting on a soft euro scenario, and was therefore bound to react dramatically to the threat of EMU postponement, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market reacts to any comment that suggests there might be delay, simply because they're exposed that way round,&quot; said Standard Chartered's Tinker.</p>
