<p>Two Yemeni men claiming ownership of Mars filed a law suit against the U.S. space agency NASA for trespassing during its current mission to the red planet.</p>
<p>But the country's prosecutor general said on Thursday they had withdrawn the case after he threatened them with arrest.</p>
<p>Weekly newspaper al-Thawra said Mustafa Khalil and Abdullah al-Amri had presented documents to prosecutor general Mohammad al-Bady which they said proved their claim.</p>
<p>&quot;They said they received the planet as an inheritance from ancient ancestors and therefore rejected the landing of the U.S. spacecraft on the planet without their prior notification and permission,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>NASA's Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars on July 4, setting the stage for unprecedented exploration of the planet by a dune-buggy-type vehicle called the Sojourner.</p>
<p>The two men also asked al-Bady to bring to court U.S. ambassador David Newton, saying steps taken by NASA were the responsibility of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>&quot;The two men are abnormal,&quot; prosecutor general told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;They had filed suit against NASA a few days ago, but by examining the case we found out they were only seeking fame and publicity.</p>
<p>&quot;I threatened them with arrest if they failed to withdraw the case and they did,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Yemen's official news agency SABA quoted Mustapha Bahran, presidential consultant for scientific and technological affairs, as saying Fadl Salem al-Salem, a U.S. scientist of Yemeni origin, had contributed to the Pathfinder mission and findings on Mars.</p>
