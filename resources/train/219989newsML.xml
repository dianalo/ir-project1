<p>While the Peruvian government celebrated its membership of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, analysts warned the Andean nation had to improve its competitivity before joining in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an honor and a challenge,&quot; said Industry Minister Gustavo Caillaux after Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced Monday the 18-member trade grouping had agreed to admit Peru and Vietnam by 1998.  </p>
<p>But with APEC seeking to lower regional trade barriers by 2020, to compete against such powerful economies as the United States and Japan, Peru will have to develop its infrastructure, promote its export industries and adopt a more realistic value of its currency, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we have to prepare our port infrastrucure for exports,&quot; said Hugo Sologuren, president of the Lima Chamber of Commerce. &quot;The idea is not just to take advantage of the Pacific Rim market but also to make Peru the gateway for South American exports.  </p>
<p>Peru, which still has a worrisome trade gap, also needs to export in more of a wider product range to move away from a dependency on raw material exports such as metals, oil and fishmeal, according to trade analyst Anibal Sierralta.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a country that only exports raw materials - not manufactured products, which is where we must direct our efforts,&quot; Sierralta said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to strengthen our industrial sector. Otherwise we will just become a gateway for the large production centers on the Atlantic side such as the south of Brazil and the north of Argentina.&quot;  </p>
<p>Peru is slowly narrowing its trade gap, which more than doubled to $2.115 billion in 1995 from $1.021 billion the previous year.</p>
<p>This year the country's trade deficit fell nine percent in the first nine months to $1.404 billion compared with the same period last year. Exports grew 5.0 percent to $4.364 billion while imports rose 2.0 percent to $5.768 billion.</p>
<p>Sologuren recommended the government carry out policies to force the sol's depreciation to a more competitive rate since exporters were being hurt by what he considered as the overvalued national currency.</p>
<p>The government and Central Reserve Bank have a policy to allow a depreciation of the sol but have permitted the change only gradually in an attempt to avoid inflationary pressures.</p>
