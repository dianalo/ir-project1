<p>Canadian bonds opened little changed on Monday, with volumes light amid a lack of fresh economic data and many traders focused on activity in the long end of the curve, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much news, certainly nothing out of the U.S. and nothing out of Canada on the economic front,&quot; said Rich Wylie, a fixed-income economist with TD Securities Inc. &quot;Most of what people are going to be looking at today is Canada's long end spread.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.03 to C$116.37 to yield 6.723 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 5/32 to yield 6.71 percent. The spread between the bonds moved to one basis point from zero on Friday. On Thursday, the Canada-U.S. 30-year spread went negative for the first time in history.</p>
<p>&quot;We're doing what we've done in most of the other terms as the Canadian curve has broken through the U.S. curve,&quot; said Wylie. &quot;We expect to see the 30-year rate back underneath that in the U.S. over the near term for sure.&quot;</p>
<p>With no major Canadian or U.S. economic reports out this morning and a heavy calendar of data out this week, analysts said today's session is expected to be quiet.  </p>
<p>Key economic reports out this week include Canada's consumer price index report for May on Tuesday and the retails sales report for April on Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. economic reports out this week expected to affect the the market include their consumer price index report for May, also on Tuesday, and the Fed Beige book on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond rose C$0.11 to C$108.13 to yield 6.145 percent while the U.S. 10-year rose 4/32 to 6.41 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds widened to 27 basis points from 25 basis points at Friday's close.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 2.82 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 4.95 percent.</p>
