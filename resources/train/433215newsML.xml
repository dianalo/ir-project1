<text>
<p>A Hong Kong human rights group on Tuesday urged the United Nations to act on Beijing's plan to dilute some freedoms in the territory after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty this year.</p>
<p>In a letter to the U.N. Human Rights Committee, Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor called on the committee to look at Beijing's decision to scrap or amend the British colony's Bill of Rights and other laws protecting civil liberties.</p>
<p>Hong Kong returns to China at midnight on June 30 after more than 150 years of British rule.</p>
<p>The group said Beijing had so far failed to explain how the laws violated the Basic Law, the mini constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong.</p>
<p>China also plans to dissolve the elected Legislative Council, undoing in a stroke recent democratic reforms instituted by Britain.</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights in particular was adopted to ensure that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was fully incorporated in the laws of Hong Kong, the group said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor therefore requests that the committee express its concern to the (Chinese) government at the implications of these recent developments for the implementation of the covenant in Hong Kong,&quot; the letter stated.</p>
<p>The group also asked the committee to find out if Beijing or Hong Kong officials would discuss implementation of the covenant after the handover at midnight of June 30.</p>
<p>China has said it is considering signing the human-rights covenant, which would allow the international community to monitor its performance.</p>
