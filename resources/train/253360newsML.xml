<p>Switzerland's lower house of parliament on Thursday approved curbing the post office monopoly on delivering small packages, moving ahead with a PTT overhaul that will partially privatise telecommunications in 1998.</p>
<p>The National Council in Berne voted to cut the post office monopoly to packages of up to two kg (4.4 pounds) from up to five kg (12 pounds), but rejected as too ambitious a business-backed motion to chop the ceiling to 350 grams.</p>
<p>The move, which must still be approved by the upper house, is part of a package of legislation designed to split the state Post, Telephone and Telegraph authority into two seperate units. The National Council approved the concept on Wednesday.</p>
<p>While the telecommunications activities will be transformed into a joint stock company with the Swiss government holding a majority, the postal authority will remain a state-owned agency without benefit of cross-subsidy from the telecoms arm.</p>
<p>The goal is to sell a minority stake in Swiss Telecom. Full privatisation is not envisaged because this would require changing the Swiss constitution, a very lengthy process.</p>
<p>The reform is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 1998, in line with the European Union's liberalisation of its telecommuncations market.</p>
<p>PTT chief Felix Rosenberg warned in an interview with the Weltwoche weekly that the programme had to move ahead quickly to let the Telecom arm compete effectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Every year with no liberalisation costs us a cumulative 100 million Swiss francs,&quot; he said, through business that migrates abroad and the undermining of national borders through so-called call-back businesses and the like.</p>
<p>Switzerland took a first step to loosening its telecommunications law in 1991, letting private companies offer some kinds of data transmission. But the PTT still holds a monopoly over most voice transmission and the cellular network.</p>
<p>Switzerland's place in the top 10 telecommunications markets and its fat margins should attract several competitors when the telecoms monoply falls in 1998, to the joy of consumers.</p>
<p>But privatisation plans have been viewed with suspicion for years by politicians who fear some customers in remote areas could lose their telephone service.</p>
<p>&quot;We always lacked clear political leadership in this area, as was provided in Germany by Christian Schwarz-Schilling and in the United States by Vice President Al Gore,&quot; Rosenberg said.</p>
<p>Telecom PTT is required to provide general basic service for five years after the changes come in. New competitors can offer regional service, spokesman Sepp Huber said.</p>
<p>But the PTT is girding to compete. It has lured away a top executive ffrom IBM Europe to run its telecoms operations and has started investing in foreign markets through stakes in the Czech Republic's SPT and a Malaysian mobile phone company.</p>
<p>&quot;Because we will lose market share in Switzerland with the liberalisation, we must compensate for this abroad. In addition, we will be making money in Czech Republic as well as in Malaysia in five years,&quot; Rosenger said.</p>
<p>Telecom made an operating profit of 1.5 billion Swiss francs last year and is budgeted to post the same result this year, Huber said. It employs 21,000 people and plans to cut 4,000 jobs over the next four years.</p>
