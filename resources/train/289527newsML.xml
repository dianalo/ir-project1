<title>FRANCE: TWA increases cargo rates ex-Paris.</title>
<headline>TWA increases cargo rates ex-Paris.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-01-06</dateline>

<p>Trans World Airlines said it had increased its ex-Paris cargo rates by an average of three percent, effective January 1.</p>
<p>TWA operates daily passenger services between Paris and New York and Boston using Boeing 767-300 aircraft which can carry around 10 tonnes of freight per flight.</p>
<p>&quot;The increases do not indicate an upturn on Transatlantic routes but are rather an attempt at recovering lost ground in terms of cargo yields over the past couple of years, particularly in 1995&quot; a Charles de Gaulle (CDG) based TWA cargo official told Reuters.</p>
<p>TWA last adjusted its ex-Paris cargo rates in April 1996 when it applied increases of between four and five percent.</p>
<p>TWA was also offering less ex-Paris cargo capacity following the established practice of suspending its daily 767-300 Paris-St Louis service during the winter season, the official said.</p>
<p>However, abundant capacity continued to be the dominant feature on Transatlantic routes, with the trend accentuated during the first fortnight of January when demand was traditionally flat.</p>
<p>&quot;Introducing rates increases at this time of the year is a bit of gamble but one we have been obliged to take out of economic necessity. We'll only have a clear idea of any negative reaction by forwarders later in this month and in February,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;A rise of around three percent may appear minor  but it is put into perspective when one considers that there are carriers on routes to North America who are still more than ready to cut rates&quot; he added. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017</p>
