<p>A battling 92 from Australia opener Mark Waugh and a late-order charge pushed Australia to a hefty 267 for seven in their World Series limited overs cricket match against West Indies at the WACA on Sunday.</p>
<p>Australia appeared to bog down midway through their innings against some accurate West Indies spin bowling, but a late flurry of boundaries brought 97 runs from the final 10 overs to create a competitive total.</p>
<p>A good batting pitch and the fact they chased down 281 to beat Australia a week ago must leave the West Indies confident of overhauling the target.</p>
<p>Brian Lara hit a stylish century on the same pitch on Friday to lead the West Indies to 258 for five and victory over Pakistan with eight balls to spare.</p>
<p>Australia, bottom of the table in the tri-nation series, must win this match to have any hope of making the series finals later this month.</p>
<p>Australia have lost their last five international matches but have not missed a place in the annual international limited overs series since the 1979/80 season.</p>
<p>West Indies lead the competition with four wins from six games and are virtually assured of a place in the finals.</p>
<p>Australia's innings began well in blustery but sunny conditions, with Waugh and struggling captain Mark Taylor scoring 59 runs in the first 15 overs.</p>
<p>But the loss of Taylor chopping a rising ball from pace bowler Curtly Ambrose on to his off stump and tight spin bowling by Jimmy Adams and Carl Hooper restricted Australia to just 44 runs between the 20th and 32nd overs.</p>
<p>Realising a score under 250 would not be enough on this pitch, Waugh and then middle-order batsmen Michael Bevan and Greg Blewett cut loose in the final 15 overs, driving and pulling to score 10 fours and one six between them.</p>
<p>Waugh, who scored a century against the West Indies a week ago, struggled with a hamstring injury for the latter third of his innings and survived several clear chances.</p>
<p>A succession of no-balls and dropped catches did not help West Indies, who had improved their fielding and bowling dramatically in the last month.</p>
<p>Pace bowler Ian Bishop was particularly costly, unleashing four wides and two no-balls to concede 49 runs from nine overs.</p>
