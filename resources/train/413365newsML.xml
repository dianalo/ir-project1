<p>Albania plunged into fresh chaos on Sunday as armed rioters went on a rampage in the Adriatic town of Sarande and the opposition called for an urgent meeting with President Sali Berisha to find ways to end the crisis.</p>
<p>Rioters seized weapons after sacking the Sarande police headquarters, then torched buildings and looted shops and banks in increasing anarchy in the south of the Balkan nation.</p>
<p>Reuter correspondent Costas Paris saw thick, black smoke billow from the headquarters, a library and a bank in the town, a short ferry ride from the Greek holiday island of Corfu.</p>
<p>Residents cruised the streets in cars, shooting into the air with looted Kalashnikov assault rifles. Sarande hospital officials said there were no casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;Our commanding officers have fled. We don't know what to do. People stole about 400 Kalashnikovs from police headquarters,&quot; an army lieutenant said.</p>
<p>In Tirana, leaders of the opposition Forum for Democracy called for an urgent meeting with President Sali Berisha, who ditched the government of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi on Saturday.</p>
<p>A prominent opposition figure, Democratic Alliance leader Neritan Ceka, called the removal of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi's government on Saturday a &quot;cosmetic solution&quot;.</p>
<p>He said Albania risked civil war unless Berisha gave more ground.</p>
<p>Parliament, mainly consisting of Berisha's right-wing Democratic Party, was meeting in special session on Sunday to discuss the unrest.</p>
<p>The 11-party Forum for Democracy denied its branch in the southern town of Vlore had issued an ultimatum to Berisha.</p>
<p>Reporters in Vlore were handed a statement by a protest committee in the town, which has witnessed the worst unrest in two months of disturbances in Albania.</p>
<p>The statement also said it was issued in the name of the local Forum branch. It warned Berisha if he did not meet their demands protest supporters from the south would move on Tirana.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not true. We are for a totally non-violent solution to this crisis,&quot; a Socialist Party spokesman said. &quot;We categorically deny that any ultimatum was issued.&quot;</p>
<p>Up to nine people were reported killed in a gun battle between residents and the Shik secret police in a night of bloody anarchy in Vlore on Friday.</p>
<p>Meksi quit following the bloodiest night of violence in the former Stalinist state, Europe's poorest, since 40 died in food riots in 1991. A father-of-two was the first victim of clashes in Vlore on February 10.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Forum in Tirana said it wanted Berisha to dissolve parliament, set up a technocrat government and prepare for an early and fair general election.</p>
<p>The collapse of a string of risky, high-yield pyramid investment schemes in January unleashed a wave of unrest, mainly in the more prosperous south where thousands poured their meagre savings into locally-based funds.</p>
<p>Students and high school pupils have also come out against the right-wing government, staging hunger strikes at universities in Vlore and Gjirokaster, near the Greek border.</p>
<p>Authorities and residents in the northern town of Shkoder, including its mayor, have also expressed support for Vlore protesters.</p>
<p>The opposition Forum has also urged Berisha to postpone a presidential election set for Monday.</p>
<p>Berisha was certain to win the election in a parliamentary vote scheduled for 10 a.m. (0900 GMT) on Monday as his Democratic Party holds 122 seats in the 140-member chamber.</p>
