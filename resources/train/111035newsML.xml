<p>Campbell Soup Co. said Friday it would pay $80 a share, or $1.08 billion, to buy all 13.5 million shares that were tendered in response to its offer last month to buy up to 18 million of its own shares.</p>
<p>Campbell's stock shot up $1.375 to $79.875 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the giant soup company said it would pay $80 for each of the 13,528,975 shares tendered in its so-called Dutch auction tender offer, which expired Thursday.</p>
<p>The company, based in Camden, N.J., had offered to buy up to 18 million shares at a price range of between $69 and $80 a share.</p>
<p>The company said the actual number of shares to be purchased and the precise price were subject to final confirmation and the delivery of all shares tendered.</p>
<p>The stock buyback is the first part of a three-year, $2.5 billion share repurchase programme that Campbell announced Sept. 5, when it unveiled plans to transform itself into one of world's top consumer goods companies.</p>
<p>Campbell said the shares it expects to buy are about 5.5 percent of its estimated 247 million shares outstanding. The company expects to have about 234 million shares outstanding after the repurchase.</p>
<p>The company said it intended to proceed with the share repurchase programme, but also declared that it will not be purchasing shares in the open market until Nov. 14.</p>
