<p>British Prime Minister John Major officially launched England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup finals on Wednesday -- with the full support from some of English soccer's greatest players.</p>
<p>Sir Stanley Matthews, Sir Bobby Charlton, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney all said they totally supported the attempt to bring the World Cup back to England 40 years after the country last hosted the finals in 1966.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, addressing a reception at his official Downing Street residence, said: &quot;I believe it will be magnificently done and our facilities will be the equal of any in the world by then.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt about the desire of the British public to support the competition here.&quot;</p>
<p>A key element of the English bid is the rebuilding of Wembley Stadium, and the Prime Minister added: &quot;The Twin Towers will remain but the rest of Wembley will be a magnificent stadium, another reason why we would like the World Cup here.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Stanley Matthews, who played in the 1950, 1954 and 1958 World Cups, said: &quot;I think it is very important for the future of the game in England.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me that Germany has got their bid in first but I'm hoping that won't make a difference, because there are still a few years to go before a decision is made.</p>
<p>&quot;I think our stadiums are as good now or better than theirs or anyone else's in the world and we can more than match anyone's bid.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw every England game in Euro 96 and think that we proved that the atmosphere, the spirit and and the love of the game here is unique.&quot;</p>
<p>And Matthews, who will be forever linked with the legend of Wembley because of his match-winning performance in the 1953 F.A. Cup final when Blackpool beat Bolton 4-3, added: &quot;Of course, it is a shame that the old Wembley Stadium has to be demolished, but time moves on, and Wembley will still be Wembley, the traditions will still survive.</p>
<p>&quot;It will still be the stadium every player in the world wants to play in.&quot;</p>
<p>Finney, who played alongside Matthews for England in the 1950s, added: &quot;We fell behind the rest of the world in the 1970s and 1980s but have come back strongly in the last few years.</p>
<p>&quot;We might not have won the European championship last year, but there is no doubt the country won in terms of the atmosphere in the stadiums and the way the nation got behind the team. I think we deserve to be heard.</p>
<p>&quot;I thoroughly support this bid because it would have been a long time since 1966 and football in this country has changed a lot in the last five or six years. We should be recognised for the improvements we have achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>Bobby Charlton, Lofthouse, Gary Lineker and Geoff Hurst, who became the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final when England beat West Germany in 1966, also threw their weight behind the bid.</p>
<p>And on Tuesday night, Arsene Wenger, Arsenal's French manager, gave his support saying: &quot;Something special exists here in England as far as football is concerned, and I believe it is right that the World Cup should be held here.</p>
<p>&quot;I am backing the F.A.'s bid 100 per cent. Football is my passion, my life, I am grateful to England to be working here and it is my duty to back their bid for the World Cup.&quot;</p>
<p>England and Germany are just two of the countries bidding to host the finals in nine years time with rival bids expected from South Africa, Australia, Morocco and Egypt and possible joint bids from Brazil/Argentina and Peru/Ecuador.</p>
<p>All bids must be submitted towards the end of 1999 with the decision announced by FIFA, world soccer's governing body, in June 2000.</p>
<p>England was surprised 10 days ago when UEFA announced that it was giving its support to Germany's bid, but that situation appears to have changed.</p>
<p>F.A. chairman Keith Wiseman described the recent row with UEFA and Germany as &quot;a recent local difficulty&quot;.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;A fair and democratic consideration is all we ask for our bid without exorbitant or inappropriate expenditure.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the world to come here to celebrate the festival of football and hopefully that day will not be too far away.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Germany on Wednesday, former World Cup-winning captain and coach Franz Beckenbauer said he planned to take lessons from France's Michel Platini on how to help Germany win its bid to host the 2006 finals.</p>
<p>Beckenbauer, who captained his country to the trophy in 1974 and coached the Germans to the title in 1990, is taking on the same kind of leading role which France gave to Platini in their successful campaign to host the 1998 tournament.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to see Michel Platini at the end of the month. He's going to tell us how he got the 1998 World Cup,&quot; Beckenbauer said in an interview with the German weekly Die Woche to be published on Thursday.</p>
<p>The German campaign has the full backing of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, an avid soccer fan.</p>
<p>But the German government said it had no immediate plans to hold the same kind of high-profile reception which John Major hosted at Downing Street on Wednesday.</p>
