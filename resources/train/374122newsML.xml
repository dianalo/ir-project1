<p>Hong Kong should see strong growth in its property market in the next three years, spurred on by strong company earnings in the sector and a shortage of residential housing, a company analyst said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prices should jump by at least 10 percent a year in 1997 and 1998, said Michael Leary, senior investment analyst for Lehman Brothers Hong Kong. They rose 25 percent in 1996, he said.</p>
<p>Stable interest rates -- both in the United States and Hong Kong -- and aggressive company spending on land banks also should contribute to a bullish sector, said Leary.</p>
<p>&quot;The sector outlook that we have here is bullish,&quot; Leary told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;In a nutshell, you've got loose credit, you've got strong balance sheets, you've got aggressive spending on land bank and you've got a shortage in the residential market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The up-beat prediction comes just months before the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule on July 1.</p>
<p>Leary said he expects both the present government and the post-colonial government, to be headed by former shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa, to consider steps to increase housing supply.</p>
<p>Even so, units completed on land that the government might make available would probably not hit the market until 2001 and would not affect the sector over the next three years, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The near term picture is a compelling story,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Major intervention by the Hong Kong government to curb speculation was unlikely before mid-July because the government needed about two full quarters to determine whether the previous measures had worked, said Leary.</p>
<p>A month ago, the government said it welcomed voluntary moves by developers to curb rampant property speculation.</p>
<p>But it warned that it would have to impose tougher measures if voluntary moves proved insufficient.</p>
<p>The step came after consumers, legislators and business lobbies had all voiced concern over a rise of 20 percent to 30 percent in residential property prices in 1996.</p>
<p>The focus of concern is the luxury sector, where the government says speculation is rampant.</p>
<p>Prices in this sector jumped 30 percent to 40 percent last year, with much of the rise coming in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority recommended in January that banks limit mortgage lending for purchases of luxury properties. Speculators have reportedly paid up to HK$2 million (US$258,000) at recent luxury flat sales merely for the right to be first in line.</p>
<p>The property boom has been one of the major forces behind the rally that has carried Hong Kong stocks to record highs over recent months.</p>
