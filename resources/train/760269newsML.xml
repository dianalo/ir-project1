<headline>Swiss stocks end firm on Wall-Street led gains.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-07-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss shares ended Monday higher, boosted by late European buying after Wall Street shares staged gains in early U.S. trade.</p>
<p>The firm dollar supported dollar-sensitive stocks.</p>
<p>Traders were waiting to see how U.S. economic data due later in the week will affect stocks.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended up 41.0 points, or 0.7 percent, at the day's high of 5,888.0.</p>
<p>The broad Swiss Performance Index was up 24.74 points at 3,737.25.</p>
<p>Dealers said activity was slow compared with recent sessions. Bourse volume was a modest 1.90 billion Swiss francs.</p>
<p>Most-traded Novartis recovered from early weakness to end flat at 2,379.</p>
<p>Nestle, which has lately been lagging behind the market, climbed 33 francs to 1,932. One dealer said the stock profited from a recommendation.</p>
<p>SBC fell 10.50 francs to 414.50 after it lowered the nominal value of its shares to 40 francs from 50 as part of an already-announced capital reduction.</p>
<p>UBS rose two francs to 1,691, while CS Group was unchanged at 204.25.</p>
<p>Specialty chemical firms Ciba and Clariant continued to rise. Clariant shot up 45 francs to 1,145. The stock has seen a solid rise since the company announced better-than-expected half-year sales last week.</p>
<p>ABB, Alusuisse, Sulzer, Swissair were among the gainers on the day.</p>
<p>Among insurers, Zurich and Swiss Re saw bigger advances.</p>
