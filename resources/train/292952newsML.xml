<p>Security-conscious authorities have banned fans with painted faces from Sunday's World Cup soccer qualifying clash between old foes Uruguay and Argentina.</p>
<p>&quot;Paint on the face makes identification difficult,&quot; said Didier Opertti, Uruguay's Interior Minister.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had experiences in the past which lead us to the conclusion that whoever goes into the stadium should do so with his face uncovered.&quot;</p>
<p>Around 6,000 Argentines are expected in the 70,000 crowd at the Centenario stadium for the match, the first time that Argentina and Uruguay have met in a World Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>Opertti said special security measures would be set up in the jet-set resort of Punta del Este, around 100 kilometres east of Montevideo, where thousands of wealthy Argentines have summer homes.</p>
<p>Special areas would be created for each set of supporters to celebrate a win or drown their sorrows, he said.</p>
<p>Opertti said more than 61,000 Argentines had entered the country in the last week, most of them tourists.</p>
<p>Last year, one Argentine was killed in the border-town of Paysandu in a skirmish among rival Argentine fans after a match involving their team in the Copa America, which Uruguay hosted.</p>
<p>Tension is likely to be especially high thanks to both teams' indifferent form in the South American group.</p>
<p>Argentina, with two wins in six games, are third in the nine-team group. Uruguay, who have three wins and three defeats, are level on points but two places below on goal difference.</p>
<p>The top four teams qualify for the World Cup but only three points separate Argentina from eighth-placed Bolivia.</p>
<p>Uruguay and Argentina, who hold one of international soccer's oldest and most bitter rivalries, have not played each other since drawing 0-0 in a friendly in 1992.</p>
