<headline>Christopher hails agreement on Russia-NATO talks.</headline>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Wednesday hailed as &quot;very good news&quot; Russia's agreement to start talks with NATO on a future relationship and said Russian fears about NATO expansion could be resolved over time.</p>
<p>&quot;Today (we had) very good news that the Russian foreign minister agreed to commence discussions with NATO looking forward to a document of some kind, a charter,&quot; Christopher told reporters.  </p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said earlier that Moscow had agreed to the talks but he stressed that his country remained opposed to the planned enlargement of NATO to include former Kremlin allies in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no need to have enlargement re-divide Europe. On the contrary, enlargement can lead to the full integration of Europe,&quot; Christopher said during a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.</p>
<p>&quot;If a charter can be worked out between Russia and NATO, that will complete the integration of Europe, so we're started down the road of a unified, integrated Europe,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that over time the Russian fears can be dissolved as we go into these intensive negotiations with them for a special relationship between Russia and NATO.&quot;</p>
