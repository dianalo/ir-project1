<p>The Czech PX50 index fell 0.7 percent on Monday to 538.4, its 10th straight declining session.</p>
<p>Dealers said the attitude of foreign investors was the most important factor depressing the market but some saw the possibility of a rebound soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing is the appraoch of foreign investors who are taking profits and sitting back. It'll take a few more days before its stabilises but there are some positive signs,&quot; said Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings in Prague.</p>
<p>Vystavel said the passing of the first reading of a balanced 1997 budget last week, lower inflation in September (8.9 percent year-on-year) and signs of rising productivity in industry were likely to feed through into a recovery on the PX50 sometime soon.</p>
<p>On the index, the biggest decliner among the major issues was SPT Telecom, which dropped 57 crowns to 3,153. Komercni Banka was one of the few gainers on the PX50 shrugging off early losses to end the day up 14 crowns to 2,219.</p>
