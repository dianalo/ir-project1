<p>The overnight interbank rate fell to 6.00/30 percent from 8.00/50 just ahead of the market's close due to &quot;unexpected&quot; funds with a few large local banks, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said the overnight rate fell from 8.0 percent in just 15 minutes after the local banks came in to lend around 0800 GMT.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some large local banks seem to have got some unexpected funds very late, by which time most people had already covered their positions,&quot; said a dealer with a large local bank.</p>
<p>&quot;So when they started lending, the rate dropped,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Some dealers said it was possible that the central bank, Bank Negara, returned some of the funds borrowed directly from select banks as part of its open market operations.</p>
<p>No confirmation was available from Bank Negara, which does not comment on its money market operations.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems like a temporary mismatch. And the amount does not seem very large, it was just the timing,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>He said the market would remain tight for the next one month until the festival season ends in the middle of February.</p>
<p>The dealers said banks were hoarding cash in their vaults to allow depositors to withdraw for the twin celebrations of Eid al-Fitr and Chinese Lunar New Year festivals in mid-February.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 7.50/60 percent, two-week was at 7.40/50 and three-week at 7.35/40, all unchanged from Tuesday.</p>
<p>One-month to one-year tenors were all quoted at 7.35 to 7.40 percent, the dealers said.</p>
