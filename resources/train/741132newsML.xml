<p>Top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the United States was formulating an initiative to break the deadlock in peace talks with Israel.</p>
<p>He told Reuters by telehpone from the United States that U.S. officials at the highest levels were preparing a &quot;package deal&quot; but would not reveal details to the parties involved until it had been worked out fully.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. administration is studying and working on ideas to formulate an initiative to help restart peace talks,&quot; Erekat said.</p>
<p>He said he had talks in Washington with U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, a key figure in the new initiative. Pickering also met Uzi Arad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political adviser, in Washington.</p>
<p>Peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians have been at a standstill since March when Israel began building a new Jewish settlement on occupied land in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A U.S. initiative in April failed to revive talks and U.S. officials have since avoided direct mediation between the two sides. The Palestinians say they will not resume negotiations until Israel halts settlement building.</p>
<p>A Palestinian official said Arad proposed in Washington last week that a decades-old Israeli initiative known as the Allon plan could serve as the starting point for fresh talks. &quot;I think Allon plus could be a basis for reviving the talks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu outlined to his cabinet last month a final settlement plan, likened to the Allon plan, under which Israel would keep key areas of the occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>He has also suggested moving immediately to talks on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and freezing implementation of interim agreements, including further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank. Palestinians have rejected this.</p>
<p>Erekat said: &quot;I told Mr. Pickering that any U.S. package deal would have to include a pause in all settlement activities and that final status talks must take place parallel to implementation of outstanding interim issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel and the Palestinians, meanwhile, traded charges over Israeli allegations that a senior Palestinian security official sent three police officers to attack Jews in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Palestinians denied the charge and accused Israel of trying to divert attention from what they said were the Jewish state's own violations of the interim peace deal.</p>
<p>The Israeli army arrested three Palestinian police officers in the West Bank this week and said it had thwarted an attack on Jews in a settlement near Nablus.</p>
<p>A government official said later that Israel had &quot;electronic evidence&quot; proving that a top Palestinian security official ordered the attack. The official named the Palestinian but refused to speak on the record.</p>
