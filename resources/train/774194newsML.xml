<title>NETHERLANDS: DUTCH CALL MONEY REVERTS TO LOWER LEVELS.</title>
<headline>DUTCH CALL MONEY REVERTS TO LOWER LEVELS.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-08-01</dateline>

<p>Dutch call money eased from the highs  reached earlier this week, as a generous allocation under the central  bank's latest special advances pact brought liquidity back into the  market.</p>
<p>Dealers said call money changed hands between 3.12 and 3.18 percent,  down from a peak of 3.50 percent early on Thursday.</p>
<p>This morning the central bank allocated 5.29 billion guilders to the  money market under a new seven-day special advances pact at an unchanged  rate of 3.00 percent.</p>
<p>The new pact replaces a seven-day facility of 4.15 billion guilders  which expired today.</p>
<p>Individual banks received 18.0 percent of the amount they had applied  for.</p>
<p>&quot;We had expected the allocation under the pact to be ample...call  has returned to more normal levels,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said he considered overnight guilder rates of some 10 basis points  above the special advances rate reasonable.</p>
<p>The central bank confirmed on Thursday it had bought guilders from  other central banks, and dealers said these transactions had probably  pushed call rates higher.</p>
<p>The guilder fractionally strengthend against the mark, trading at  112.606 per 100 marks, versus 112.635 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Other money market rates and rates for Dutch Treasury Certificates  were unchanged from Thursday and trade was fairly quiet, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;People will wait to see the U.S. data coming up this afternoon, before  deciding whether or not they want to do something in the Dutch money  market,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
