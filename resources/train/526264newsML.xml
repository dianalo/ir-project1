<title>AUSTRALIA: SFE wheat up on Australia, Europe dry, U.S. frosts.</title>
<headline>SFE wheat up on Australia, Europe dry, U.S. frosts.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-04-21</dateline>

<p>Australian wheat futures moved sharply higher in nearer-term contracts on Monday on Australian European and U.S. weather concerns.</p>
<p>In Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) floor trades, July 1997 jumped A$8.00 to A$196.00 on five lots and January 1998 rose A$1.00 to A$189.00 on two lots. Settlement prices also rose well with May and July 1997 both up A$6.00 and more distant contracts generally up by about A$1.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>Gary Booth of Ord Minnett Jardine Fleming Futures Ltd said SFE wheat's rise was on dry European and Australian weather and increased assessments of U.S. frost damage.  </p>
<p>The Australian Wheat Board's continuing success in striking export deals for Australian wheat was against the background of continuing dry weather in Australia's southeast, Booth said.</p>
<p>Traders shorting the SFE market were forced to cover on Friday night, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's very positive. We continue to see wheat moving to resistance at US$4.86 (a bushel) December. The Sydney wheat contract now has a real chance of A$200.00 a tonne,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said hedging resistance should emerge at this level. &quot;The difficulty is ... do we get the rain ... have they anything to hedge?&quot;.  </p>
<p>Northern New South Wales (NSW) and southern Queensland had reasonable sub-soil moisture to plant on, but further south in NSW and into Victoria and South Australia conditions sharply worsened with not enough moisture to plant, Booth said.</p>
<p>Some areas had had record lack of rain although Western Australia had received good rain, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's simply waiting hoping we get sufficient rain to sow and get some sort of crop,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There was still a few weeks to go before the real danger point but as time passed pressure increased on the domestic feed wheat market, he said.  </p>
