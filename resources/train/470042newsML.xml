<p>The U.S. Teamsters union has written to United Parcel Services Italy protesting against UPS plans to cut 150 jobs in Italy.</p>
<p>Teamsters president Ron Carey said the union is registering its &quot;strongest possible protest over the treatment of UPS workers in Italy&quot; and urged UPS Italy &quot;to reconsider its harsh stance against the workers just demands for full-time and secure jobs free from harsh working conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a major global corporation, UPS must abide by international standards of acceptable behaviour for multi-national companies,&quot; he said in a letter obtained by Reuters. &quot;UPS's treatment of its Italian work force violates these standards.&quot;</p>
<p>Carey said Teamsters represents nearly 200,000 UPS workers in the U.S.</p>
<p>Under Italian labour laws the job cuts will start to take effect in 45 days from March 6. A national eight-hour strike of the 900 UPS Italy staff is scheduled for March 28 with further action planned for April.</p>
<p>Delegates from the company's Spanish unions are meeting in Milan today, and union sources said Spanish staff plan action in support of that by their Italian counterparts.</p>
<p>Air express industry sources said that on February 11-12 , the Teamsters meet with other unions from around the world who also bargain with UPS to form the World UPS Trade Union Council.</p>
<p>The unions said they would provide mutual support and exchange information about their dealings with UPS at a national level.</p>
<p>UPS said it had not been invited to participate or contribute to the meeting and: &quot;As such we are unable to comment. However UPS does welcome open communication with its employees and actively communicates with its staff representatives.&quot;</p>
<p>Other industry sources noted that the current four-year UPS-Teamster contract in the U.S. is up for renewal in July.</p>
<p>Carey said he understood the Italian unions intended to continue their action until a fair agreement is negotiated. &quot;It is not only right that you do this, it is also important for business reasons. If UPS gets a global reputation as a company which has labor problems overseas and experiences frequent disruptions, its large customer base in the United States may decide to take their business elsewhere.&quot; --Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+5017</p>
