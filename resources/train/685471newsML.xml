<p>The Angolan government has stepped up a media campaign to justify its month-long military offensive into UNITA-held areas in the northeast, diplomats and military analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the government has embarked on a campaign to try to legitimise their offensive in the northeast,&quot; one diplomat in Luanda told Reuters.</p>
<p>Angola's national army has taken control of at least 10 UNITA-held diamond-mining districts, saying it is acting to curtail an influx of Zairean refugees over the northern border.</p>
<p>It has met resistance from armed UNITA members protecting the movement's mining interests, which some industry analysts put as high as 80 percent of all diamond territory in the country.</p>
<p>But UNITA, the former rebel movement which signed a peace pact with the government in 1994, has insisted it is unable to fight back as it has abided by a U.N.-sponsored demobilisation process and no longer has a fighting force.</p>
<p>The government and most observers in Angola have challenged the statement and estimate UNITA has some 10,000 armed fighters.</p>
<p>For weeks the government media virtually ignored the fighting. But late last week articles on the offensive began appearing in the government daily, the Journal de Angola.</p>
<p>Foreign journalists have been denied permission to go to the region but on Sunday a group of Angolan journalists travelled to the area and that night Angolan television ran images of captured UNITA soldiers and weapons.</p>
<p>The government on Tuesday presented a former UNITA colonel, who told a Luanda press conference the former rebels were preparing for war.</p>
<p>The first 15 minutes of national television news on Tuesday night was dedicated to reported UNITA troop movements in various parts of the country, seized weapons, the &quot;defecting&quot; colonel, an old tape of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi denying UNITA was rearming, then another interview with the colonel rejecting the denial by Savimbi.</p>
<p>National radio on Wednesday reported more UNITA troop movements in the provinces and an influx of civilians into the government-held town of Cafunfo in the Lunda Norte region.</p>
<p>The radio said the civilians were heading for the town because of UNITA troop movements around the strategically important UNITA city of Lusamba.</p>
<p>Military analysts said it was likely the government's media campaign was laying the ground for a renewal of the military offensive in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;The fighting is at a lull in Lunda Norte at the moment,&quot; one analyst told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But you can count on it picking up again after the Security Council meets (on June 27). The government wouldn't bother to go to all this trouble with the propaganda if this was the end of it. It is very unlikely we have seen the end of the fighting.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.N.'s special envoy to Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye, left Luanda for New York on Monday to brief the United Nations Security Council on Angola's 30-month-old peace process.</p>
<p>Analysts say UNITA is capable of cranking out its own propaganda but UNITA's main media outlet, a short wave radio station, is monitored by few people.</p>
