<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn denied his Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy had raised the possibility of resignation over concessions to protesting farmers which would dilute his economic programme.</p>
<p>&quot;(Medgyessy) did not hold out the prospect of resigning,&quot; Horn was quoted as saying by Hungarian television on Thursday.</p>
<p>Farmers from central Hungary's Kiskoros region have set up roadblocks since February 24 protesting that taxes were too high and demanding that they be exempt from making social security contributions.</p>
<p>On Wednesday they failed to show up to a meeting with Horn and Medgyessy after which Horn said negotiations were off.</p>
<p>&quot;The government regards the talks as finished,&quot; Horn told reporters.</p>
<p>Medgyessy said he would remain in his post as long as no concessions are made to &quot;preferred social sectors&quot;.</p>
<p>He added regular employees still pay twice as much tax as farmers do and that he would not agree to regulations that would result in unequal burdens.</p>
<p>&quot;I am unwilling to agree to any substantial change affecting the proportionate sharing of tax burdens,&quot; Medgyessy said.</p>
<p>The statement comes only days after Medgyessy urged the government and social groups to agree to a programme of slashing inflation and curbing wage growth in 1998.</p>
<p>The comments apparently contradicted Horn who had earlier played down the importance of wage rises in generating inflation.</p>
