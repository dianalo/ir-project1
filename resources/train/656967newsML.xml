<title>UNITED NATIONS: Robinson appointed U.N. human rights commissioner.</title>

<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday appointed Irish President Mary Robinson as the new U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p>&quot;I have decided to name Mrs. Mary Robinson as the next high commissioner for human rights,&quot; Annan told a news conference. He said he wanted her to begin the job in September, although her term does not expire until December.  </p>
<p>Robinson had been the leading candidate for the post, vacant since March, but faced Third World objections because she is a European. Annan said he would shortly appoint a deputy, who would come from a developing country.</p>
<p>The position has to be approved by the General Assembly, and Annan appeared fairly certain that Robinson, supported strongly by the United States and Britain, would be endorsed.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based job, first proposed nearly 50 years ago, became vacant after Jose Ayala Lasso resigned in March as the first human rights commissioner to become Ecuador's foreign minister. He was appointed in 1994 for four years.</p>
<p>Robinson, 52, a lawyer and human rights expert, campaigned for the post after Annan took office. Her closest competitor, Sonia Picado of Costa Rica, was rejected late last month, making it all but certain that Annan would appoint Robinson.</p>
