<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures were expected to open marginally higher Wednesday, lifted by early talk of firmer cash prices, market sources said.</p>
<p>July over-the-counter trade ranged from $2.16 to $2.17 after settling Tuesday at $2.159 per mmBtu.</p>
<p>On ACCESS, July last traded 1.1 cents higher at $2.17.</p>
<p>&quot;They're trying to kick out Henry Hub cash. Then they're trying to push the board higher...An AGA number north of 90 (bcf) should keep it on the defensive though,&quot; one trader said, noting Henry Hub cash prices were talked at $2.19-2.23.  </p>
<p>Injection estimates for today's American Gas Association stock report range from 75 bcf to 110 bcf versus an 87 bcf gain a year ago.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said July support was still at $2.055 and $2. Resistance was pegged at $2.21, $2.25 and $2.37, though many traders said they expected the contract to remain range bound in this session.</p>
<p>In the cash Tuesday, Louisiana Gulf Coast gas held steady in the mid-to-high teens. Midcon pipes gained a couple of cents to about $2.05. New York city gate gas was flat in the low-to-mid $2.40s.</p>
<p>Warmer weather moving into the Midwest and Northeast by Friday and into the weekend will likely boost demand, traders said, adding that continued heat in the Southwest will also create additional cooling demand.</p>
