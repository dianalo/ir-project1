<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hogs sold steady to $1.00 per cwt higher than Wednesday's top prices, as frigid weather accompanied by windy conditions in some areas of the Midwest kept marketings light, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I was out there trying to get some things done this morning and with that wind you don't want to be messing around too long,&quot; one central Iowa packer buyer said.</p>
<p>Iowa and southern Minnesota hog prices were up to $55.00 at country buying stations and up to $56.00 at plants.  </p>
<p>Illinois hogs sold at a top of $56.00 in the country and $57.50 at plants. Indiana/Ohio top plant prices were $55.25. Moderating temperatures expected later Thursday in the western Corn Belt could result in more hogs showing up at country buying stations and plants, which may pull prices lower.</p>
<p>Mixed wholesale pork prices Wednesday also were spurring some packers to tell their buyers to hold off on buying hogs for the weekend, the dealers said.</p>
<p>Loins Wednesday were quoted $2.00 to $4.00 per cwt up but hams were mostly $4.00 to $5.00 lower, USDA said. Pork cut-out values slipped $0.35 to $0.41 per cwt, USDA said.</p>
