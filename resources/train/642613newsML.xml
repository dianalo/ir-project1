<p>Sierra Leone's coup leaders said on Friday they wanted all-party talks to find a peaceful solution to a standoff with Nigeria, which wants to restore civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah to power.</p>
<p>Officials in Ghana said that Sierra Leone's West African neighbours were consulting on a common approach to the crisis, sparked by a May 25 coup, and that an emergency summit was planned for Nigeria's capital Abuja sometime next week.</p>
<p>A statement from Major Johnny Paul Koromah's Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) said it wanted to make known to the international community its desire to negotiate, and sought the help of any country or organisation willing to mediate.</p>
<p>Colonel Abdul Sesay, defence spokesman, told Reuters the council, which earlier made clear it would not reinstate Kabbah, was open to negotiations on the timing of fresh elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The AFRC wishes to make it known to the international community that it is still willing and ready to continue negotiations,&quot; the statement said, adding that talks should be open to all &quot;stakeholders&quot;.</p>
<p>Rebels who took up arms in 1991 have rallied to the junior officers who staged the coup and have flooded into the capital. Residents and sources close to efforts to defuse the standoff say their presence adds volatility to the crisis.</p>
<p>Sesay said &quot;stakeholders&quot; included the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), whose founder Foday Sankoh has been named AFRC vice-chairman despite being under house arrest in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Other stakeholders included Kabbah's and other political parties and Kamajor traditional hunters, who allied with the army to push back the rebels before clashing with the army itself.</p>
<p>&quot;We are open to negotiation but it is extremely important that the view of all parties in the negotiations be considered seriously with the aim of reaching a peaceful and lasting settlement,&quot; Sesay said.</p>
<p>Freetown was calm on Friday and residents said they hoped for a negotiated settlement to the crisis. Queues formed outside the rare food shops that were open.</p>
<p>The AFRC statement said it was willing to negotiate with the Economic Community of West African States, whose chairman is Nigeria, or &quot;any other international organisation ready to mediate in finding a lasting solution to the political crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>Sesay said the AFRC had sent a delegation to Ivory Coast and would send delegations to Ghana and Nigeria.</p>
<p>The week began with Nigerian gunboats shelling Freetown in a show of force and dissident soldiers and rebels turning on Nigerian soldiers guarding foreigners at a beachfront hotel. The United States, France and other countries evacuated nationals.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone's chief of defence staff Brigadier Samuel Koroma said on Thursday they had sent a message to Nigerian military leader General Sani Abacha through a Nigerian delegation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sent a message...saying that General Abacha must choose between peace in Sierra Leone or the forced return of president Kabbah to power by Nigeria and ECOMOG,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nigeria, which had troops in Freetown under a defence pact, has been steadily reinforcing in the city since the coup.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not prepared to hand over to former president Kabbah,&quot; the chief of defence staff said. &quot;If president Kabbah takes over again, he will jeopardise the peace that we have been able to achieve with the RUF rebels.&quot;</p>
<p>The poor, war-shattered country's third coup in five years has been condemned at home and abroad. Kabbah was elected in March 1996 after four years of army rule. He is in Guinea. A peace accord signed by Kabbah and Sankoh in November fell apart.</p>
