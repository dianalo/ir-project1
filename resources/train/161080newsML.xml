<p>Over 100 children at a kindergarten in northern Japan are believed to have been infected by the killer germ responsible for the mass food poisoning which spread across Japan this summer, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Children from the Aoi-nishi kindergarten in Obihiro city in Hokkaido prefecture began complaining last week of symptoms linked to the O-157 coli bacillus, and 23 children diagnosed as carrying the germ have since been hospitalised, Obihiro health officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>Since last week's outbreak, a total of 180 people, including 120 children, have reported symptoms typical of the O-157 germ, including severe diarrhoea and vomiting, the official said.</p>
<p>But not all have been diagnosed as carrying the killer germ and &quot;some may merely be reporting a flu&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>The O-157 colon bacillus responsible for the mass food poisoning has already claimed 11 lives and made more than 9,000 ill in Japan this year. The city of Sakai, near Osaka in western Japan, was hit the hardest, with nearly 6,500, mostly elementary school children, affected by the disease.</p>
<p>Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning which hit Sakai, but researchers have been unable to locate the exact source of the infection.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak at the kindergarten, Obihiro health officials have started checking lunch samples served there, as well as the cooking utensils and water from a nearby well used in cooking.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to urge all those involved to be very careful as 0-157 survives even in cold places,&quot; Health Minister Naoto Kan told reporters on Friday. &quot;I don't know what to do with it (0-157) appearing despite all the strict precautions we're taking.&quot;</p>
<p>In the latest count, 120 children, 32 family members of the children, and five employees and family members have come down with the disease, according to the Obihiro health official.</p>
<p>Among the 23 hospitalised, 12 have developed haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), complications associated to infection by the 0-157 bacteria.</p>
<p>Separately, health officials in Saga prefecture in western Japan, said researchers found the O-157 bacillus in one of 40 flies collected in and around a place where there was a cluster of food poisoning cases.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't heard of any cases in the past in which flies have caused the (O-157) infection and we are waiting for instructions from the health minister,&quot; a Saga health official said.</p>
<p>Researchers had not found the bacteria in any other part of the facility and were puzzled as to how the fly came to carry the germ.</p>
