<p>Italy's Costantino Rocca discarded a rib support he has been wearing for two months and took the lead in the first round of the rain-hit Scandinavian Masters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rocca, ninth in Europe's Ryder Cup table, carded a seven-under-par 65 to lead by a stroke from another Cup hopeful, Ireland's Padraig Harrington, and Spain's Jose Rivero.</p>
<p>Another Spaniard, Ignacio Garrido, Joakim Haeggman of Sweden and England's Mark Roe were a further stroke back.</p>
<p>Rocca, who had finished his round before a three-and-a-half hour suspension for lightning and torrential rain, established his lead with seven birdies and no bogeys.</p>
<p>The Italian suffered a rib injury two months ago. He had to pull out of the U.S. Open and slipped down the Ryder Cup table.</p>
<p>&quot;I took off the bandage today and felt really free, the first time I've been able to turn and swing properly for a long time,&quot; said Rocca. &quot;It was my best round of the year and I feel good.</p>
<p>&quot;I know I have to do well out of the five events left before the (Ryder) team is selected and this is a good start.&quot;</p>
<p>There was gloom at the last for Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, currently holding the 10th and last place in Europe's Ryder Cup table.</p>
<p>Olazabal bogeyed the last in near darkness for a 69 to be four off the lead.</p>
<p>Jesper Parnevik of Sweden, who could get one of Severiano Ballesteros's wild cards for Valderrama, along with Englishman Nick Faldo, if Olazabal qualifies in an automatic top-10 place, shot 70.</p>
<p>European Order of Merit leader Ian Woosnam of Wales crashed to a 76 while one of his main rivals, Colin Montgomerie of Scotland, who lies third in the European rankings, hit a 72.</p>
<p>The rain delay left several players needing to return to the course on Friday morning to complete their first rounds.</p>
