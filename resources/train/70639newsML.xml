<p>Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, fresh from his election victory, will announce a cabinet of reformers over the next two days to push forward changes in the economy, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;He said he will not simply be an administrator prime minister. He will tackle problems and his cabinet will reflect action in all fields,&quot; a senior official from Simitis's ruling socialist PASOK party told Reuters.</p>
<p>Simitis's convincing election win over the opposition conservative challenger on Sunday gave him space to ignore in-party politicking and to name a fresh and more efficient cabinet, firmly bearing his personal stamp.</p>
<p>&quot;He needs the experience of the old guard but they must forget old habits and work hard if they want a place in his government. The younger PASOK generation will also be pushed up to cabinet posts,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Simitis's first priority will be to implement a disciplined, pro-European policy to stimulate the country's economy and a faster absorption of EU funds to modernise Greece's poor infrastructure.</p>
<p>&quot;We have problems with absorbing EU funds -- only 30 percent of the total scheduled for 1996 -- and this is because many people in key ministry positions were too lazy to work. They are already history,&quot; another official close to Simitis said.</p>
<p>He said tight fiscal policy with state spending cuts of $1.2 billion will be reflected in next year's budget that will bring down the general government deficit to 4.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 7.6 percent, expected this year.</p>
<p>Greece wants to join the European Monetary Union after 1999 and the EMU requirement for the deficit is no more than three percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The economy portfolio probably will be retained by Yannos Papandoniou, a Cambridge-educated economist, credited with cutting chronic double-digit inflation to 8.5 percent in August.</p>
<p>Simitis also wants to keep Finance Minister Alexandros Papadopoulos, who proved an effective tax collector, but may not be able to convince him to remain in one of Greece's hardest ministries. The black economy now amounts to 30 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Education Minister George Papandreou, son of the late socialist leader Andreas Papandreou, is a possible replacement for Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, notorious for offending Greece's allies with his frank comments.</p>
<p>The defence ministry will probably go to Interior Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos with the hard task of upgrading the country's armed forces to deter Turkish territorial designs on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>The bill to buy new weapons may reach $10 billion in the next five years and Simitis said during the campaign that he may resort to foreign borrowing to come up with part of the amount.</p>
<p>In Brussels, officials and diplomats said NATO and the European Union were seeking signs that Simitis's election will lead to an easing of tension in the east Mediterranean.</p>
<p>They said his unequivocal victory should give him the strength to bring Athens closer to Ankara after years of antagonism on the alliance's southern flank.</p>
