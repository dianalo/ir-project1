<p>Just hours before Michigan Gov. John Engler was to give his state of the state address Tuesday evening, Democrats in the state House released their legislative agenda.</p>
<p>The Democrats, who took over control of the House from Republicans following the Nov. 5 election, called for tax credits for low-income residents and for the care of children, the elderly and the disabled.</p>
<p>The lawmakers also proposed an income tax credit for families with children in college and the removal of a five-year limit for senior citizens to defer paying their property taxes.</p>
<p>Other items on the agenda included the reinstatement of uniform academic standards for schools in basic subjects and the repeal of a new law that requires photo identification to vote in elections.</p>
<p>House Speaker Curtis Hertel, D-Detroit, said that voters &quot;sent a clear signal by dividing&quot; the state government in the last election. And he called on Republicans in the legislature and the Republican governor to &quot;work with us in a bipartisan spirit to help improve the lives of Michigan's working families.&quot;</p>
<p>Engler is expected to outline his agenda for the year during his state of the state speech Tuesday evening.</p>
