<p>Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang has defended his latest 4.7 percent 1996 economic growth forecast for the British-ruled territory against suggestions that it was over-optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever said this, whoever said we have not being doing a correct job, I think they have to come up with evidence. It is not a question of guessing,&quot; Tsang told reporters at Hong Kong's airport after returning from New Zealand late on Saturday.</p>
<p>The forecast issued by the government on Friday was a downward revision from its previous figure of 5.0 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth contained in Tsang's budget in March.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the revision was insufficient and that even 4.7 percent would be tough to achieve.</p>
<p>But Tsang said the revision was based on facts and data. &quot;I expect the rest of the year to be better than the first half,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Trade figures would improve, he said, as had jobs and price data in recent months. &quot;All the indications are that better months are ahead,&quot; he added.</p>
