<p>Fugitive Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti must pay $1.5 billion to a French company for loans he defaulted on after he bought Hollywood studio MGM in 1990, a California court ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>The state court, upholding the terms of an extradition agreement in Los Angeles in 1995, ruled Parretti must pay the money to a French holding company for losses suffered by Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland and its parent, Credit Lyonnais.</p>
<p>Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland financed Parretti's $1.3 billion 1990 acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio from billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who later bought MGM back.</p>
<p>The next year, Parretti defaulted on the loans, leading Credit Lyonnais to assume control of MGM. It later transferred ownership to the French holding company, Consortium de Realisation (CDR), which was established by Credit Lyonnais to dispose of troubled assets. Since then, Parretti and his former bankers have been suing each other over the loans.</p>
<p>Moreover, Parretti was convicted on charges of evidence tampering and perjury in a 1991 case in Delaware related to ownership of MGM. Parretti faced 10 years in jail but days before his January sentencing he fled to Italy.</p>
<p>Separate criminal charges are pending in France.</p>
<p>Under a deal he made with California in 1995 to avoid extradition to France, Parretti had agreed not to leave the country without notifying the court. He was to stay put until the civil lawsuits over the loans could be tried, according to Travers Wood, a lawyer with White &amp; Case, which represents Credit Lyonnais in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Parretti had sued Credit Lyonnais for $3.9 billion and the bank had countersued. A California Superior court in March threw out Parretti's claims against the bank because he had violated the extradition agreement. In addition, the judge told the bank officials he would rule in their favour in the case over the loans.</p>
<p>The French holding company CDR then came to California to enforce its judgment against Parretti. Superior Court Judge Joseph Kalin Tuesday issued a default judgment against Parretti and awarded CDR and Credit Lyonnais $1.1 billion in damages and $376 million in interest.</p>
<p>It was not known if Parretti, who is on the run from U.S. and French authorities, would be able pay the funds if he is caught.</p>
<p>Jay Coggan, Parretti's former attorney in Los Angeles, said the one-time high-flying movie executive is currently in his native Italy, presumably living in Rome.</p>
<p>Parretti's life and Hollywood tale could be fodder for a movie script. He was raised on an olive farm in Italy and waited tables on a cruise ship as a young man. He later came to own hotel, insurance, publishing and film companies.</p>
<p>In 1988, he moved to Hollywood where he drove expensive cars and lived in a mansion high in Beverly Hills. Two years later, he bought MGM. But the studio did not produce hit movies, its revenues lagged and Parretti's funding quickly dried up, leading Credit Lyonnais to cease control of MGM.</p>
<p>In an ironic ending to MGM's Parretti years, MGM was eventually sold back to Kerkorian in 1996 for about the same price he had sold it to Parretti years earlier.</p>
