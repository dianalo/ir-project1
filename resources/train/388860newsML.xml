<p>Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing's tour on Wednesday of an ECI Telecom plant raised hopes at the Israeli telecommunications company for a long-awaited $60 million contract with China's Ji Tong Communications Co.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that this visit has taken place here...I think we have reason to be optimistic,&quot; ECI President and CEO David Rubner told reporters at the inauguration of the plant, which was designed to fulfill the contract.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;I cannot under any circumstances give you any dates or deadlines because the things are not in my control&quot;.</p>
<p>China is among ECI's top 10 markets. &quot;It's not our largest market at the moment but it definitely has one of the largest potentials,&quot; Rubner said.</p>
<p>ECI and China's Ji Tong Communications Co signed a cooperation agreement in September 1995 under which ECI would supply a complete network for customs information processing and foreign trade transactions.</p>
<p>The contract is subject to Chinese government approval.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some government approvals that still have to be obtained, or maybe they have been obtained and we have not been notified,&quot; Rubner said.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to arm yourself with a lot of patience in order to do business with China.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the contract would run for three years. The Ofakim plant was built in five months and began production in October 1996.</p>
<p>Commenting to reporters later, Li said Israel and China should work together.</p>
<p>&quot;I think if we join our efforts we can create a very, very strong competition force,&quot; Li said.</p>
<p>Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Liu Shanzai said in formal remarks: &quot;I also hope this ECI factory produces high quality, high level products that are going to be used by China's Golden Bridge project&quot;.</p>
<p>ECI's business with China doubled from 1995 to 1996, reaching $27.5 million last year compared to $14 million in 1995, Rubner said. Volume in 1994 was similar to that in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It has grown very nicely...before 1994 it was a question of one or two million dollars,&quot; Rubner said.</p>
<p>Rubner said ECI accounts for 40 percent of total Israeli exports to China, a market it entered in the 1980s before ties were established between China and Israel in 1992.</p>
