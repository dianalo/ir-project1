<p>U.S. spot fuel oil prices held relatively steady again Thursday in lackluster trade, with prompt high sulphur grades still well-supported by bunker and export demand, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market feels stable to firmer. There is a little demand out there,&quot; said one cash trader, adding high sulphur still seemed better supported.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent was unchanged at $15.00-25 a barrel, with May one percent paper steady to up slightly in the low-$15s, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour also held steady at $16.00-25.</p>
<p>Traders said this week's rally in natural gas prices could stir better low sulphur utility interest.</p>
<p>NYH 2.2 percent was still pegged at $14.50-75, while three percent remained quoted at $14.25, traders said.</p>
<p>No NYH deals were reported.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, prices also were stable, with one percent still at $15.00-25 and three percent at $13.50.</p>
<p>Traders said a major sold 45,000 barrels of prompt 3.5 percent (nine gravity) at $13.05 (FOB Miss. River).</p>
<p>New York city gate gas prices gained more than a nickel Thursday to the mid-$2.40s/mmBtu, or $15.44 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, was up a similar amount to about $2.07/mmBtu, or $13.04 a barrel.</p>
