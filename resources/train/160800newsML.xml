<p>Saudi Arabian security officials were holding some 40 Saudi citizens whom they have concluded were involved in the truck bombing of a U.S. military housing complex in Dhahran in June, the Washington Post reported in its Friday edition.</p>
<p>Quoting unidentified sources, the newspaper said the attack had been traced to a broad conspiracy that the Saudis were convinced was backed by the government of Iran.</p>
<p>The suspects, who had been secretly imprisoned for at least three months, included the man who Saudi officials said drove the explosive-laden vehicle, according to the report.</p>
<p>The truck bomb was detonated just beyond the apartment complex's fence and killed 19 U.S. Air Force service members.</p>
<p>The Post's sources, familiar with the Saudi side of the investigation, told the newspaper the internal inquiry was complete and what remained of the Saudi probe was being conducted outside the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Saudi government obtained confessions from some of those arrested as well as other evidence that it said implicated Iran as the instigator and sponsor of the attack, the Post reported. In addition, there was evidence suggesting potential advance knowledge or involvement by Syria.</p>
<p>But several U.S. officials told the Post they had not reached any conclusions yet about who was behind the bombing in Dhahran.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Saudi security officials had not yet fully briefed Washington on their findings, partly out of concern that the Clinton administration in the days before the election, might rush to retaliate in a way that the Saudis would view as harmful.</p>
<p>The Saudis had privately advised senior U.S. officials that they wanted to participate in any decision on how to respond to the evidence, it added.</p>
