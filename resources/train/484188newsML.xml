<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chrnomyrdin earned less than $700 a month in 1996 and had no major property holdings, a government spokesman said on Thursday, denying media reports that the premier was among the world's richest people.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Igor Shabdurasulov as saying the annual income of Russia's second top official after President Boris Yeltsin totalled 46.39 million roubles ($8,000) last year.</p>
<p>Shabdurasulov denied media reports that Chernomyrdin had $5 billion in shares of Russia's Gazprom gas monopoly. Chernomyrdin headed the firm before he joined the Russian government.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no such thing as Gazprom shares when Chernomyrdin became premier,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shabdurasulov said that virtually everything Chernomyrdin used now belonged to the state, rather than to him personally.</p>
<p>&quot;He has no country palaces, mansions or such which would count as his own,&quot; he said. &quot;Viktor Chernomyrdin lives at a state country residence where everything, apart from personal belongings, belongs to the state.</p>
