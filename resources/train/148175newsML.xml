<p>Osteotech Inc said Monday it will discontinue its PolyActive polymer research program in a restructuring that should return the company to profitability in the first half of 1997.  </p>
<p>Osteotech said it expects the restructuring of its Netherlands operations to make those operations profitable in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>The company said the restructuring will not affect its revenue base but should save about $1 million a year in expenses.</p>
<p>Excluding restructuring charges, Osteotech said it continues to expect a pretax profit of more than the $1.653 million reported in 1995.  </p>
<p>Osteotech reported earnings of $0.02 per share in the second quarter, compared to a $0.10 per share loss in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The company said it expects to see a fourth quarter pretax charge of about $1.35 million from the restructuring.</p>
<p>Ostetech said its Netherlands division has incurred pretax losses each year since Osteotech acquired them in May 1992.</p>
<p>The losses include $1.384 million in the year ended December 31, 1995, and a pretax loss of $721,000 in the six-months ended June 30, 1996, Osteotech said.  </p>
<p>As a result of the restructuring, the company said, it is immediately discontinuing OsteoActive Bone Void Filler, its lead product in the polymer research and development program.</p>
<p>Osteotech said it intends to focus its efforts on its revenue-producing ceramic and titanium plasma spray coating services and ceramic powders and products, which are used by orthopedic and dental implant companies.</p>
