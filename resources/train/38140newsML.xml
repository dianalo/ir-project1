<p>Workgroup Technology Corp said Friday that it expects revenues for the second quarter 1996 to be below analysts' estimates and that the shortfall could result in a net loss for the quarter.</p>
<p>The company added that it expects revenue for the remaining quarters of the fiscal year to be below analysts' projections. Workgroup said in a statement that additional expenses related to the formation of a new development unit, along with the decrease in revenue, could result in net losses for the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year as well.  </p>
<p>Workgroup used analysts from Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc, Wessels, Arnold &amp; Henderson, and Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co to project revenue estimates for the second quarter ending September 30, 1996 and for the remaining quarters of the fiscal year ending March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>An analyst from Alex Brown said he had lowered his revenue estimate for the year to $13.5 million from $17 million and decreased earnings per share to $0.06 from $0.28.</p>
<p>Workgroup reported first quarter 1996 results of $3.47 million in total revenues with a net income of $881,000, or $0.10 per share.</p>
<p>President and CEO James Carney cited three reasons for the &quot;potential revenue shortfall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our European operations, which were started last year, are anticipated to produce revenue levels less than what we had planned,&quot; Carney said in the release, citing weaknesses in the European economy and a &quot;less mature&quot; market for the company's products and services.</p>
<p>Carney also said delivery of an NT version of the company's server product has been delayed until the fourth quarter, and that Workgroup is experiencing &quot;slippage in the timing of the closing of several significant orders.&quot;</p>
