<p>McDonald's Corp., which has withdrawn salmon burgers from its 36 restaurants in Norway after four people became ill, said Thursday it cannot say when it will resume selling the McLaks.</p>
<p>&quot;Until we have better knowledge, we don't want to speculate&quot; when sales of the salmon burgers will resume, said Agnete Samdahl, spokeswoman for McDonald's in Norway.</p>
<p>McDonald's and food health authorities in Norway have been checking the product and &quot;tests to date show no problem,&quot; Samdahl said in a telephone interview from Norway.</p>
<p>The McLaks salmon burgers have been sold in Norway for several years.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, two customers and two employees at a McDonald's restaurant in Lorenskog apparently became ill after eating the salmon burgers and were hospitalized. They have since been released, she said.</p>
<p>As a precaution, McDonald's withdrew the product from all of its restaurants in Norway, she said.</p>
