<p>Albanian President Sali Berisha, his party defeated in elections, made good on campaign promises and said he would resign while his Socialist rivals revelled in victory and vowed to build a country free of corruption.</p>
<p>But a fight over control of the important interior ministry remained unresolved. Berisha called for the appointment of a new minister, while the Socialist prime minister said the man now in the job was still performing his duties.</p>
<p>With Socialists far ahead in the still incomplete count three days after Sunday's first round of voting, Berisha said he would step down once a leftist government took power.</p>
<p>Pressed repeatedly on whether he would resign, Berisha said in English: &quot;Definitely. There is no doubt of that. I never had the smallest doubt in that respect.&quot;</p>
<p>Berisha said he had constitutional duties to perform before the next government was formed, suggesting he would hand in his resignation once the new parliament convened. Under the constitution, parliament elects and removes the head of state.</p>
<p>Albania's first non-communist president, Berisha was praised in the West after initially winning election in 1992 for rapid introduction of market reforms</p>
<p>He was later criticised for resorting to increasingly authoritarian methods and many Albanians accused him of failing to check the spread of pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>The collapse of four such funds earlier this year unleashed a wave of violence which has killed more than 1,500 people.</p>
<p>Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano told 7,000 cheering supporters in central Skanderberg Square that a centre-left coalition would turn Albania into a modern country to face the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Not Berisha's primitive capitalism, but a real market system with private banks and a strong currency, free of corruption,&quot; he said. &quot;Our historic destiny is to tell the world that this country is no longer run by the mafia.&quot;</p>
<p>Nano said the government would work with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and abide by the advice they gave in ordering the country's finances.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not promising paradise but work, peace, order and movement towards Europe,&quot; he said. In a carnival atmosphere contrasting with stage-managed pre-election rallies, supporters embraced and wept before dispersing as the sun went down.</p>
<p>Results from 83 of 115 constituencies contested under majority rules gave the Socialists and allied parties 49 seats to eight for Berisha's Democrats. A party representing the Greek minority in southern Albania won a single seat.</p>
<p>Run-offs were required in 25 districts were no candidate got the required 50 percent of the vote. In 40 seats contested under a proportional system, the Socialists were outscoring the Democrats two-to-one with just over 52 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Berisha appeared determined to hang on, at least temporarily, to control of the Interior Ministry in the face of stiff resistance from Socialist Prime Minister Bashkim Fino.</p>
<p>Under an agreement setting up Fino's multi-party government in March ahead of Sunday's early elections, the interior ministry was assigned to Berisha's Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The presidential office insisted on Wednesday evening that the post was vacant because Interior Minister Belul Celo had left the country. Fino said Celo was still in office.</p>
<p>Groups of armed men had confronted each other on Tuesday night by Skanderbeg Square before dispersing without shots being fired. A government spokesman said the situation had been defused after a series of tense calls to the presidency.</p>
