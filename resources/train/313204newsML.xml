<headline>Handelsbanken defends takeover prospectus.</headline>

<p>Swedish bank Handelsbanken rejected on Thursday a newspaper article that critisised the bank's prospectus for its 22.9 billion crown takeover bid for Swedish mortgage bank Stadshypotek.</p>
<p>&quot;Handelsbanken's prospectus is standard for a cash bid,&quot; said Kjell Ormegard, the bank's head of corporate finance.</p>
<p>Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter had said the prospectus with about 20 pages may not be sufficiently comprehensive to convince shareholders to accept the bid.</p>
<p>The paper's stockmarket commentator compared the prospectus with insurer Skandia AB's now withdrawn prospectus for a merger with Stadshypotek, finding that Skandia's prospectus contained 10 times more pages.</p>
<p>But Ormegard argued it was not possible to compare the two outlines as a merger proposal means shareholders will keep their shares, making them interested in what will happen with the company.</p>
<p>With a cash bid, shareholders solely focus on the price as they will not have anything to do with the future company, he said.</p>
<p>The paper was critical that the prospectus merely concerned Stadshypotek not the plans for the future bank but Ormegard dismissed this argument.</p>
<p>&quot;Before we placed the bid, we had not talked to Stadshypotek's management, so we do not know how we will reorganise the company,&quot; Ormegard said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were merely invited by the finance ministry to place a bid (on the government's 34 percent Stadshypotek stake).&quot;</p>
<p>Ormegard said the bank will discuss plans for reorganisation with Stadshypotek's management when the bank has control of the mortgage lender, that controls a third of Sweden's mortgage market.</p>
<p>Ormegard also dismissed the paper's statement that small Stadshypotek shareholders are dissatisfied with the fact that accepting Handelsbanken's deal will mean no dividend for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;A share price always includes expectations about a dividend, so a bid (which is based on the share price) has already encompassed that,&quot; Ormegard said.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected a dividend of around 10 crowns per share and Skandia's bid would have allowed Stadshypotek shareholders to keep it.</p>
<p>The paper said the bank runs the risk of not receiving 90 percent of the shares in Stadshypotek which are required to force remaining shareholders to turn in their shares and complete the deal according to plan.</p>
<p>But the Swedish Shareholders' Association on Thursday reiterated its recommendation that Stadshypotek shareholders accept Handelsbanken's cash bid.</p>
<p>Handelsbanken launched its bid in December 1996 and it immediately received government approval, making Skandia withdraw its November merger proposal.</p>
<p>The government was opposed to the proposal to merge Skandia and Stadshypotek.</p>
