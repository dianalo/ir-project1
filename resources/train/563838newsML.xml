<p>Australian pianist David Helfgott hummed his way into the audience's heart at his opening London concert, but the critics panned the man who inspired the Oscar-winning film &quot;Shine&quot;.</p>
<p>Classical music lovers and the curious who packed the Royal Festival Hall, sold out weeks before Monday night's concert, could hardly believe their ears as Helfgott muttered and chuckled his way through his opening Mendelssohn piece.</p>
<p>Helfgott's recovery from mental breakdown inspired &quot;Shine&quot;. Australian actor Geoffrey Rush won a best actor's Oscar in March for his interpretation of Helfgott in the film.</p>
<p>Throughout his London concert, the latest stop on a world tour, Helfgott appeared immersed in the music and oblivious to the fact that he was not on his own.</p>
<p>It was often hard to concentrate because of his mumblings, atonal groaning and humming, sometimes in tune.</p>
<p>During Beethoven's Appassionata sonata, Helfgott tapped his feet loudly to keep rhythm. &quot;Here comes the hard bit,&quot; he told himself during Liszt's La Campanella.</p>
<p>Several times the music and Helfgott's interpretation collided head-on and even non-aficionados winced at the crash. After one particularly tough section, he stopped for a few seconds to shake his right hand before continuing.</p>
<p>But he was heartily applauded throughout the 90-minute recital, even if the cognoscenti could be heard clucking disapprovingly in the expensive seats. Helfgott studied piano at London's Royal College of Music before suffering his breakdown.</p>
<p>Helfgott gave three encores, bobbing in pleasure to the audience, many of whom gave him a standing ovation.</p>
<p>But critics were not among those who shouted their approval.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all, though, it was a performance that was usually sad, frequently embarrassing and sometimes distasteful,&quot; said the Daily Express.</p>
<p>The Guardian said scathingly that &quot;to describe him as a pianist would be to stretch the term beyond normal bounds&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a shameful occasion, plumbing new depths in cynical promotion,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The London Evening Standard was less harsh but pinpointed Helfgott's lack of attention to detail. &quot;For an hour the concert veered between lucidity and vacuity as Helfgott's mind wandered in and out of the matter in hand,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>But the organisers of the concert would have been well-pleased. Seats at the back of the hall cost 20 pounds ($32.59) and a souvenir brochure six pounds.</p>
<p>After his New York debut in March, Helfgott won five standing ovations but little praise from critics. The Washington Post said his concert was &quot;a painful and disturbing experience&quot;. ($1=.6136 Pound)</p>
