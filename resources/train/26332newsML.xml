<title>VENEZUELA: Venezuela re-opens world's highest cable car.</title>

<p>Venezuela has partially re-opened the world's highest and longest cable car, closed five years ago following a fatal accident, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>William Davila, governor of the Andean state of Merida, 440 miles (700 km) west of the capital Caracas, said the first two legs of the eight mile (12.5 km) long cable car system were opened on Saturday.</p>
<p>The cable car, which rises to 15,500 feet (4,765 metres) above sea level, is one of Venezuela's most important tourist attractions offering spectacular views of cloud forests and snow-topped peaks at the northern limit of the Andes mountain chain.</p>
<p>Davila said the ride to the final station should be open by August next year.</p>
<p>The cable car, built by French and Swiss engineers in two years starting in 1957, was one of many large-scale infrastructure projects completed during the regime of then dictator Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez with money generated by Venezuela's oil exports.</p>
