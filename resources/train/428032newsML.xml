<p>Shares of Atmel Corp were down 15 percent early Friday afternoon after the semiconductor company said its inability to get products to market quickly enough would hold back its fiscal first-quarter profits.</p>
<p>Atmel dropped to a session low of 25-1/2 before recovering to 2-3/4, down 4-3/4, in early afternoon trade. The stock was one of the most heavily traded on the Nasdaq, with almost 12 million shares changing hands.  </p>
<p>Atmel said it expected first-quarter profits to fall short of earlier expectations, with revenues as much as 10 percent lower than the $281.1 million generated in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>According to a First Call survey, analysts had estimated Atmel's earnings would show little change from the fourth quarter, when the company posted earnings of $0.53 a share. In the 1996 first quarter, Atmel earned $0.45 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;We were not able to deliver new products fast enough and complete the customer qualifications to enable us to meet our revenue goals,&quot; George Perlegos, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Scovel said the conversion to higher-density flash memory chips happened much faster than many had anticpated.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is coming more competitive as time goes on because there's so much wonderful opportunity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Atmel has done very well in the past. I think they will continue to do so, but a lot of that will depend of their ability to get out new products,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Already the market is getting ready for the next-generation 64-megabit flash memory chips.</p>
<p>Atmel said it would release first-quarter results on April 10.  </p>
<p>Shares of Microchip Technology Inc, which also makes flash memory chips, were down 7-1/16, or about 20 percent, at 28-1/2 in afternoon trading. Traders said that decline was tied to Atmel's warning and the drop in its share price.</p>
