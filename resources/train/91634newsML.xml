<title>PORTUGAL: Portugal public sector union tables wage demand.</title>

<p>Portugal's main public sector trade union group is demanding a seven percent increase in wages next year, its president said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We demand a wage increase of seven percent for 1997,&quot; Carlos Mamede, president of the Common Front, the main union group representing Portugal's civil service, told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said the demand was justified by a fall of 4.6 percent in civil servants' purchasing power over the past five years. Public sector wage increases had lagged those in the private sector, he added.</p>
<p>The demand is above the Socialist government's target to bring inflation down to 2.25-2.50 percent by December 1997 from a forecast 3.0 percent at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Three public sector union groups representing an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 civil servants are demanding wage increases next year of between 4.5 and seven percent, officials said.</p>
<p>Arnaldo Silva, the government's number two public sector wage negotiator, told Reuters last week that public sector wage increases next year must be below the 4.25 percent agreed for 1996 as tight control of state spending was essential for Portugal's hopes of joining a single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>The 1997 wage negotiations between the government and public sector unions must begin by law before October 15 when the government presents its budget proposals to parliament.</p>
