<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Monday he saw no danger that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition would fall apart even though the parties were unable to agree on how to cut the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Waigel, on his way into a meeting of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party, said a Sunday evening meeting with Kohl failed to reach an agreement on the 1998 budget.</p>
<p>He said he could not rule out tax increases to fill budget holes. In his brief remarks to journalists, Waigel did not mention the government's dispute with the Bundesbank over its plans to revalue central bank gold.</p>
<p>&quot;The coalition was united in its opinion that every opportunity to privatise should be used,&quot; Waigel said.</p>
<p>He added that the government would have to take care  not to cause problems with state-held companies it plans to privatise. He was apparently referring to Bonn's interest in further reducing its 75 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom.  </p>
<p>Following a meeting of leaders of his Christian Social Union (CSU) political party, Waigel said the main question regarding the revaluation of the Bundesbank assets was whether it could begin this year or next year.</p>
<p>&quot;We will discuss this with the Bundesbank,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;We will try to do this in mutual agreement.&quot;</p>
