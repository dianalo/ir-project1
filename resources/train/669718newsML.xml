<p>Brazil's Central Bank said it will make its monthly-based Selic overnight rate an annualized based rate as of January 1998.</p>
<p>It also said the Central Bank's Basic Interest Rate (TBC) and its Basic Assistance Rate (TBAN), currently monthly based rates, will also be set in annualized terms.</p>
<p>The current monthly effective Selic overnight rate is 1.63 percent. June's TBC rate is 1.58 percent, while the TBAN is 1.78 percent.  </p>
<p>Francisco Lopes, the Central Bank's director of monetary policy, told reporters the measure is aimed at stimulating the use of annualized rates in the market.</p>
<p>Lopes believes the annualized rates are a step toward eliminating the market's obsession with basing yields from short-term investments on monthly inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;To evaluate real interest rates every month no longer makes sense,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lopes also said the government has only taken that measure because domestic interest rates &quot;reached a compatible level.&quot;</p>
<p>Real interest rates fell from an annualized 30 percent in 1995 to about 17 percent in 1996. They are projected to fall to about 13 percent this year.</p>
<p>By adopting the annualized rates system, the government also shows that Brazil's stabilization program is on the right track, he added.</p>
