<headline>Dow slips but Nasdaq sets record as Intel pleases.</headline>

<p>U.S. blue chips pulled back from their record peaks as a morning rally gave way to afternoon profit-taking, but the Nasdaq Composite set another record as bellwether Intel posted solid quarterly earnings.</p>
<p>A day after ending above 6000 for the first time, the Dow industrials slipped five to about 6005. &quot;We're up 450 points in five weeks and 850 since July 16. We have a new millenium of 6000 and a lot of good news,&quot; said Alfred Goldman of A.G. Edwards. &quot;We've come a long way in a short time. ... The odds favor a pause to refresh and then work higher.&quot;  </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 lost one to about 703. NYSE losers outpaced gainers 13-10 on heavy volume of about 460 million shares.</p>
<p>But the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite notched its second consecutive record closing high, up two to about 1258. Intel surged 3-1/2 to 111-1/8 after setting a fresh 52-week high of 114-1/4. Intel reported that third-quarter profits jumped 40 percent, surpassing even the most optimistic Street estimates.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a market inspired early in the day by Intel and although Intel has not given up most of its gains, most tech measures have and turned in bouts of profit-taking,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist of Fahnestock &amp; Co.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was a similar profile among bank stocks. They had on-target or slightly better-than-expected quarterly results by a penny or two,&quot; Barthel said. Among those reporting, Chase Manhattan was unchanged at 82-1/2, Citicorp rose 1-1/4 to 94-5/8 and First Chicago NBD was up 1-5/8 to 48-1/4.</p>
<p>&quot;The market can't accelerate through current levels. The market is tired and needs another catalyst to get it over. It could be delivered by CPI, but I'm not certain the number has been somewhat discounted,&quot; Barthel added. September consumer prices are set for release Wednesday morning with an expected 0.3 percent increase.  </p>
<p>Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Prudential Securities, said stocks were helped and hindered by earnings surprises. &quot;We had positives and negatives. Bay, Cognex and Russell really got whacked. And then you had good results from Zilog, Chrysler, VLSI evened it out.&quot;</p>
<p>Bay Networks lost 3-1/8 to 20-7/8 after reporting a drop in first-quarter net income after one-time charges and news that chief executive Andrew Ludwick had resigned. Morgan Stanley, Smith Barney and Rodman &amp; Renshaw downgraded Bay.  </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Transportation Average climbed 47 points or 2.29 percent to 2105, mostly due to strength in component Conrail Inc, which surged 14-1/8 to 85-1/8. CSX Corp agreed to merge with Conrail in an $8.4 billion deal that would create a freight transportation company with over $14 billion in annual revenues. The pact values Conrail at $92.50 a share. CSX, another Dow transports component, lost 2-3/4 to 46-3/4.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern surged three to 95 and other railroads rose on hopes for further consolidation. Norfolk may benefit from a CSX/Conrail deal if U.S. regulators force the new firm to give Norfolk trackage rights before approving the deal.  </p>
<p>Intel's earnings report did little to buoy other chipmakers but fuelled gains in the stocks of PC makers. Compaq rose 3-1/4 to 75-1/8, Dell Computer added 3-1/2 to 88-3/8 and Gateway 2000 added 3-3/8 to 56-3/4.</p>
<p>Companies moving higher after reporting stronger quarterly results included Clorox, up 3-7/8 to 101-5/8, Dow industrials component Caterpillar, up 2-1/4 to 76-3/8, GM, up 1/4 to 52-1/8, and Chips &amp; Technologies, up 4-7/8 to 19-3/4.</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics skyrocketed 8-7/8 to 78 after news it will unveil a new technology on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The company withheld details, but analysts speculated that Robotics will introduce a modem with 56 kilobit per second transmission capabilities, much faster than existing speeds.</p>
<p>FlightSafety International jumped 5-3/8 to 49-1/4 after Berkshire Hathaway agreed to acquire the provider of training programs for aircraft pilots and technicians for either $50 a share in cash or $48 a share in stock.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.74 to 1258.10, a record.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 0.97 to 702.57.</p>
