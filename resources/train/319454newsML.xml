<title>TURKEY: Turkey and Turk Cypriot military to act together.</title>

<text>
<p>Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state on Monday vowed to act together under a &quot;joint military concept&quot; in any attack against them on the divided island of Cyprus.</p>
<p>&quot;Any aggression...directed against Turkey or the (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) TRNC will be jointly confronted and the military planning and coordination necessary for this will be done,&quot; the two sides said in a joint statement after high-level talks.</p>
<p>Tension on Cyprus has risen since the Cypriot government announced the planned purchase of Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles earlier this month.</p>
<p>Turkey, which backs the Turkish Cypriot enclave in the north of the island, has threatened to strike Greek Cypriot targets if the missiles deployment goes ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;Any attack against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus will be considered as an attack against the Republic of Turkey,&quot; said the statement, released after talks between Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.</p>
<p>It said Turkey and its ethnic kin on Cyprus would establish &quot;a joint military concept&quot; on the island.</p>
<p>Turkey's rival Greece has a military pact with the internationally-recognised Cyprus government, which controls an almost wholly Greek Cypriot-populated area.</p>
<p>Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded in 1974 in response to a Greek Cypriot coup backed by Athens. Ankara keeps around 30,000 troops in the northern third of the island.</p>
