<p>Treasury bond prices fell Monday, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to 7 percent for the first time in nearly four weeks.</p>
<p>Analysts said a fresh supply of government debt coming to market this week, along with renewed fears that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates, combined to pressure prices.</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury fell 18/32 to 96-28/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, jumped to 7.0 percent, the highest since it closed at that level on July 30.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market's pessimism started to brew late on Friday after the Fed announced summaries of discussion at its July meeting of policy-makers.</p>
<p>The summary showed Federal Reserve officials shifted their stance toward a more restrictive monetary policy for the first time since March 1995. The Fed's decision was seen as another indication that an interest rate hike before the end of the year remains possible.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (the Fed's decision) caught a lot of investors off-guard,&quot; said Kevin Flanagan, first vice-president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;We have not eliminated the prospects of a Fed tightening as many had thought.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the bears control the ball,&quot; said Michael Strauss, managing director and chief financial strategist at Chase Securities Inc. &quot;I do expect higher rates going forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Some analysts said the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond could rise to 7.25 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts also were awaiting the government's report on August employment, which is scheduled to be released on Sept. 6. The jobs report has had a significant impact on the bond market in recent months because the market views the data as a reliable indicator of inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of nervousness awaiting the job market data. So people are reluctant to buy and we also have the supply coming up,&quot; said David Sloan, senior economist at consulting firm I.D.E.A. Inc.</p>
<p>The Treasury will sell $18.75 billion worth of two-year notes on Tuesday, followed by the auction of $12.5 billion of five-year securities on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market paid little attention to the release Monday of existing home sales data for July. The indicator fell 0.5 percent last month to a seasonally ajusted annual rate of 4.14 million units.</p>
<p>The three-month Treasury bill rate closed up one basis point at 5.06 percent. The six-month bill rate was up two basis points at 5.16 percent. The year bill was up three points at 5.45 percent. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.</p>
<p>The two-year note closed off 3/32 at 100-4/32, yielding 6.18 percent. The five-year note traded down 6/32 at 100-7/32 to yield 6.57 percent. The ten-year note fell 11/32 at 101-13/32, yielding 6.80 percent.</p>
