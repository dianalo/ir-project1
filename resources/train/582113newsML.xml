<title>RUSSIA: Maverick Chechen threatens bombs after peace deal.</title>

<p>Maverick Chechen guerrilla Salman Raduyev pledged on Wednesday to continue a campaign of bombings directed against Russia despite a peace treaty signed on Monday between the region's elected leader and President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>&quot;I will blow up installations, but I intend in future not to take responsibility,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted the Moslem fundamentalist and secessionist fighter as saying.</p>
<p>Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said last month Raduyev was mentally ill. Chechen officials opened criminal proceedings against him after he claimed responsibility for two fatal bomb attacks on southern Russian railway stations last month.</p>
<p>Surrounded by well-armed fighters, Raduyev has remained at liberty, although his regular threats to stage bigger attacks on Russian targets have not been carried out. He made his name during the separatists' 21-month war against Russian troops with a hostage-taking raid outside Chechnya in January 1996.</p>
<p>Raduyev told Interfax he would &quot;peacefully co-exist&quot; with the Chechen authorities but called Monday's peace treaty signed by Maskhadov a &quot;diplomatic trick&quot; by Russia. As a result, he would &quot;continue...the armed struggle for national independence&quot; and seek to extend it to the whole Caucasus area.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said Maskhadov declared May 12 would henceforth be a holiday in Chechnya in honour of the treaty.</p>
<p>Under it Yeltsin agreed to base relations with the region on &quot;norms of international law&quot; while reasserting Chechnya would never be fully independent. The two sides have agreed to defer a final decision on its status until 2001.</p>
