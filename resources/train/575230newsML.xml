<title>USA: BASEBALL-YANKEES' WELLS, RIVERA COMBINE TO FIVE-HIT ROYALS.</title>
<headline>BASEBALL-YANKEES' WELLS, RIVERA COMBINE TO FIVE-HIT ROYALS.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Yankees got their World Series rings, and then David Wells and Mariano Rivera combined on a five-hitter as Bernie Williams had three hits, including a homer for a 3-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals Sunday.</p>
<p>Wells (4-1) tossed seven shutout innings before tiring in the eighth, when Kansas City scored twice. He gave up five hits and a walk with six strikeouts as he won his third straight start -- all at Yankee Stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt in control,&quot; Wells said. &quot;I didn't throw a lot of breaking stuff. I was moving my pitches in and out. I got some key pitches and some key plays behind me. I just tried to pitch my ballgame.&quot;</p>
<p>The left-hander gave way with one out in the ninth to Rivera, who walked Jay Bell but got the final two outs for a save in his 10th straight appearance. Rivera has 13 saves, tying Randy Myers of Baltimore for the major-league lead.</p>
<p>With the help of a caught stealing and a double play, Wells faced the minimum 18 batters through the first six innings.</p>
<p>&quot;He's a battler and a competitor,&quot; Yankees manager Joe Torre said. &quot;He doesn't complicate things or try to do too much. He's a throwback, challenging the hitters and daring them to hit the ball.&quot;</p>
<p>Derek Jeter drove in a run and scored another for the Yankees, who completed a 5-2 homestand and beat the Royals for the fourth time in six games this season.</p>
<p>With two out in the third, Williams belted a 3-0 pitch well into the left-field seats for his sixth homer.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a 3-0 fastball that just sailed,&quot; Williams said. &quot;It sailed right into my swing.&quot;</p>
<p>Royals starter Jose Rosado (3-1) took the loss.</p>
<p>In a pre-game ceremony, the Yankees received their rings for winning the 1996 World Series.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, B.J. Surhoff homered, tripled and singled while tying a career-high with six RBI as the Orioles defeated the Seattle Mariners 9-5.</p>
<p>Surhoff had two chances to become the third player in Oriole history to hit for the cycle, but struck out both times. &quot;I had some opportunities but I just couldn't do it,&quot; said Surhoff. &quot;I can't say I didn't think about it. &quot;</p>
<p>Scott Erickson (6-1) allowed two runs, five hits, and four walks over six innings for his fourth straight victory, joining Baltimore's Jimmy Key, New York's Andy Pettitte, Toronto's Roger Clemens, and Texas's Bobby Witt as the only six-game winners in the American League.</p>
<p>Dennis Martinez (1-3) was tagged for eight runs -- seven earned -- eight hits and four walks in four innings.</p>
<p>In Boston, Lee Stevens tripled, doubled and drove in three runs and Julio Santana earned a win in his first major league start as the Texas Rangers defeated the Red Sox 8-6 to complete a sweep of their three-game series.</p>
<p>It was Texas's first sweep of the Red Sox since June 1994. The loss was the fourth in a row and eighth in nine games for the Red Sox, who completed a 1-6 homestand.</p>
<p>Santana (1-0) was an emergency replacement for Roger Pavlik, who felt tightness in his elbow warming up.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Albert Belle went 3-for-3 with his eighth career grand slam and Wilson Alvarez tied a career high with 12 strikeouts as the White Sox handed the Oakland Athletics their season-high fifth straight loss, 8-5.</p>
<p>Belle has hit in eight straight games for Chicago, which has won six of its last seven games.</p>
<p>Alvarez (2-4) allowed five runs and six hits over seven innings.</p>
<p>Chicago lost outfielder Lyle Mouton and Dave Martinez after they collided while chasing George Williams's flyball in the top of the fifth. Mouton suffered a right facial fracture, while Martinez sustained a possible concussion. Mouton already has been placed on the disabled list.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Tony Clark hit a pair of homers and drove in three runs and Phil Nevin added a solo homer and three RBI to lead the Tigers to an 11-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>The Indians had won seven straight games at Detroit before dropping back-to-back contests the last two days. It was the first time the Tigers won a series from Cleveland since 1993.</p>
<p>In Milwaukee, Gerald Williams had three hits, including a home run to lead off the game, and the Brewers scored five runs in the first two innings to defeat the Anaheim Angels 5-2 and complete a sweep of their three-game series.</p>
<p>Milwaukee extended its winning streak to four games.</p>
<p>At Minnesota, Woody Williams allowed two runs in 6 2/3 innings for his first win since last September as the Toronto Blue Jays edged the plummeting Twins 3-2 for their eighth win in nine games.</p>
