<p>The Polish Peasant Party (PSL), the smaller group in the ruling leftist coalition, on Wednesday criticised the government's programme for integration with the European Union, saying it was thin on key details.</p>
<p>The plan, declaring that Poland would liberalise trade, the labour market and capital flows before it joins the EU, was adopted by the cabinet on Tuesday thanks to support of ministers from the larger, ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance.</p>
<p>PSL Treasury Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz voted against the plan at the cabinet meeting and his party colleagues said on Wednesday it lacked concrete proposals on how to modernize the economy and make it competitive enough to face EU rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not enough to have general declarations that we want to join Europe, we need to speed up the process by introducing specific mechanisms to our economy,&quot; Peasant leader Waldemar Pawlak told a news conference.</p>
<p>The government's European Integration Committee, which prepared the programme, says it is a declaration of political intent and that many more concrete schemes will be drawn up later.</p>
<p>Peasants' parliamentary leader Aleksander Bentkowski, also present, said the programme focused too much on Poland's shortcomings and obligations and failed to present Poland as an attractive partner for the Union.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot go to Europe on our knees. We have advantages which other countries lack,... such as a large consumer market and a strategic geographic location,&quot; Bentkowski said.</p>
<p>Pawlak said his party was fully in favour of Poland's membership in the EU but said integration had to proceed cautiously and Poland's economy needed a radical overhaul before the process was completed.</p>
<p>Otherwise the costs of Poland's membership would be too high both for Warsaw, which would see many companies swept away, and for the EU, which would have to pitch in too much in aid programmes, he said.</p>
<p>He said that during an upcoming parliamentary debate on the integration scheme, the PSL would press for including in it such measures as tax write-offs for firms investing in advanced technologies and export production, or cheap loans for farmers.</p>
<p>He also reiterated his proposal to speed up the crawling devaluation of the Polish currency to boost exports.</p>
<p>Pawlak also repeated the Peasants' demand that rules on land sales to foreigners should remain restrictive even after Poland joins the EU. He has earlier said prices of land were so low that foreigners could buy out large areas and speculate.</p>
<p>Last year, such remarks brought criticism from some Brussels diplomats, who said they put into question Polish politicians' commitment to EU membership.</p>
<p>Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, is seen among the first former Soviet bloc states likely to join the union.</p>
<p>It hopes to begin the accession talks early next year and to join the bloc in 2000. The European Commission, the EU executive body, says 2002 is the earliest realistic entry date.</p>
