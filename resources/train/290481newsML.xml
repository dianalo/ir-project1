<p>A consortium including property developer Nigel Wray is finalising a 17.75 million stg bid for English Premier League soccer club Nottingham Forest, a spokesman for the group said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A further 20 million stg could be raised by a flotation &quot;six months or so down the line&quot;, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The consortium, which also includes former Tottenham Hotspur chairman Irving Scholar, plans an immediate injection of 11 million stg in new shareholder funds plus a four million stg loan stock facility.  </p>
<p>The consortium would offer Forest's 209 shareholders a 20 percent participation in the new company or a cash alternative of 13,500 stg per share. It expects to circulate details of the offer to shareholders by the end of the week.</p>
<p>The future of the club was left unresolved by an EGM on Monday night at which a 13 million stg offer from a rival consortium led by businessman Sandy Anderson failed to secure the required 75 percent majority support.</p>
<p>The situation is also being monitored by a group of investors represented by Albert Scardino, a London-based American journalist.</p>
<p>Scardino said that his grouping of North American and UK media investors was looking at the possibility of coming up with a bid which would make business sense and win the support of existing shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of the week we should know if we have sufficient backing to come forward with our own offer or to merge our bid with other ones,&quot; Scardino said.</p>
