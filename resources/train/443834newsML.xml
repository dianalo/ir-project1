<p>The Swedish crown hit its lowest point for a year on Friday, with analysts expecting little short-term improvement, but finance minister Erik Asbrink was sanguine about the latest fall.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not have great worries about the crown,&quot; he told journalists in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;A slow crown softening has been going on since the autumn of 1996. With an inflation target and a floating crown this is something you have to be prepared for,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The currency slid to 4.5274 per mark in early trade on Friday, from 4.5015 the day before and later fell further to 4.5710, its lowest level in 12 months, breaking one technical support level after another on its way.</p>
<p>Lars Heikensten, deputy governor of the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, said on Thursday that the crown was undervalued and should appreciate and governor Urban Backstrom on Friday decried currency speculators.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not good to have international speculators in the crown on the market, as we now have,&quot; he told reporters at a Stockholm seminar.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the fall, following months of steady erosion was not due to any basic lack of confidence in Swedish fundamentals, although a recent analysis by U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs did not help.</p>
<p>Goldman said on Wednesday that the weak crown could oblige the country's central bank to raise rates and forecast that the currency would trade at around 4.50 per mark in six months time and a slightly weaker 4.55 a year hence.</p>
<p>Swedbank economist Knut Hallberg said that not only foreign players were selling crowns but also Swedish exporters and institutional investors.</p>
<p>&quot;Its nothing political. We can see that its mainly because of huge portfolio outflows. Insurance companies, mutual funds and such are buying a lot of foreign assets and we are really talking about a lot of money,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But currency dealers said that Friday's run on the crown was caused only by a selling frenzy among foreign funds, for which they offered no explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;Only foreigners are selling,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Hallberg said that the market expected the crown's decline to continue in the short term, but he saw a recovery ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;During spring I think there will be a gradual levelling off and I think the crown will recover again because fundamentally Sweden looks attractive and the crown is undervalued,&quot; he added.</p>
