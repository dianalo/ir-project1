<p>A provisional council set up by Beijing to govern Hong Kong after it returns to Chinese rule on July 1 will seek to amend five percent of the British colony's laws, the official China Daily said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety-five percent of Hong Kong's 600 laws and ordinances will remain unchanged when China resumes sovereignty over the territory,&quot; the newspaper quoted members of the Beijing-controlled Provisional Legislature Council as saying.</p>
<p>The council, set up to replace Hong Kong's current elected legislature, would seek to alter the remaining five percent of laws, said member Maria Tam.</p>
<p>The Provisional Legislature would also carry out important tasks before the July handover, including defining the status of permanent Hong Kong residents, China Daily quoted Tam as saying in a front-page report.</p>
<p>It gave no details of the laws and ordinances that the panel would seek to ammend.</p>
<p>China's plans to roll back Hong Kong's laws on civil liberties have provoked fierce opposition among pro-democracy activists in the territory and have aroused international concern.</p>
<p>Colonial Governor Chris Patten has condemned the plans and has criticised some provisional legislature members, including Tam, for backing Hong Kong's Bill of Rights when it was passed in 1991 only to later change their stance.</p>
