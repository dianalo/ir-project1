<p>Investor jitters over general elections in the next year and drought sweeping through Kenya have combined to slow the country's growth, economic analysts and senior financial officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya posted 1996 gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 4.8 percent compared with 4.9 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>That figure was lower than a 6.0 percent figure forecast by the finance ministry. The central bank also forecast growth at 6.0 percent in 1997 and 7.0 percent in 1998 versus treasury forecasts of 7.0 percent and 8.0 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The central bank posted Kenya's three-month overall annualised inflation at 14.7 percent in February from 9.4 percent in January on rising food prices and said it expected the trend to continue in March.</p>
<p>The Coffee Board of Kenya, citing drought and disease, has already forecast a drop in production and earnings this year. Coffee is Kenya's third largest foreign exchange earner.</p>
<p>Economic analysts said jitters in an election year meant that inward direct investment was not as fast as expected.</p>
<p>They added that a three-month delay in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) disbursement of a second tranche of $37 million of an agreed $220 million in a soft-loan programme also helped undermine investor and donor confidence in Kenya.</p>
<p>Shortages of power, water, and poor roads worsened the investment and growth climate, the economic analysts said.</p>
<p>IMF officials said an IMF Kenya review mission in December was not completed because a privatisation timetable for the Kenya Posts &amp; Telecommunications Corp was not presented.</p>
<p>They said the outstanding issues were mainly structural and revolved around privatisation because donors did not want the Kenyan government to continue bailing out ailing parastatals.</p>
<p>Central Bank Governor Micah Cheserem said inadequate infrastructure, insecurity and corruption at many levels of government, together with a weak and corrupt judicial system, uncertainty over long-term control of inflation and political uncertainty remained Kenya's current investor concerns.</p>
<p>He hinted at a news conference on Tuesday that with drought, which President Daniel arap Moi has already declared a national disaster, the GDP growth estimate for 1997 would not be met.</p>
<p>&quot;People have already started talking about GDP growth of just 4-5 percent,&quot; Cheserem told reporters.</p>
<p>But he said despite the lower-than-expected GDP growth, the economy was relatively healthy and GDP growth was picking up from comparatively depressed figures such as 0.2 percent in 1993 and 0.5 percent in 1992.</p>
<p>He saw irreversible economic reforms of the last three years, relative political stability in a turbulent region and developed communications as &quot;Kenya's positive list&quot;.</p>
<p>Cheserem said real interest rates were very high and his bank was determined to reduce them through a combination of monetary and fiscal policies.</p>
<p>Interest rates on the 91-day main category of treasury bills is now around 21 percent. Base lending rates in commercial banks range from 24 percent to 35 percent.</p>
