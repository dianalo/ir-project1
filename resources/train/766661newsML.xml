<p>Monsanto Co said Wednesday it signed a licensing agreement to develop cholesterol-lowering food products made from the oil of corn husks.</p>
<p>Preliminary studies by researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (UMass) indicate that corn fiber oil significantly lowers the amount of serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, the bad artery-clogging kind of cholesterol, in hamsters.  UMass and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have developed a patented process to extract the oil from corn.  </p>
<p>&quot;What's been found with this oil is it has potentially much higher concentrations of cholesterol-lowering ingredients compared to normal vegetable oils that most of us consume when we try to replace saturated fats in our diet,&quot; UMass biochemist Robert Nicolosi told reporters at a press conference in Boston.</p>
<p>Monsanto will pay more than $400,000 in up-front payments and funded research to UMass.  Potential royalties on revenues from future products and milestone payments will be divided by UMass and the USDA, UMass said.  </p>
<p>Nicolosi said research into processing corn fiber oil will continue, and products could reach the market as soon as two years -- or perhaps in five to 10 years.</p>
<p>Charlie Hough, a business development director with Monsanto, said the company may explore a variety of applications for the product, but its primary use will likely be as a food additive or an alternative cooking oil.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're seeing this as a potential food product primarily,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Consumers fighting to keep their cholesterol levels down could potentially use foods with the corn fiber oil in conjunction with popular cholesterol-fighting drugs on the market, he said.</p>
<p>No similiar product is on the U.S. market currently, Hough said.  However, Finnish food group Raision Tehtaat Oy Ab signed a deal earlier this month with Johnson &amp; Johnson to bring its own cholesterol-cutting agent Benecol, made from pine tree oil, to the U.S. market.</p>
<p>More than four million tons of corn fiber, which could yield about 80,000 tons of corn fiber oil, is produced each year as a byproduct, said Kevin Hicks, a researcher with the USDA.  The fiber is now used as a low-cost ingredient for cattle feed and most of it is exported to Europe, he said.</p>
