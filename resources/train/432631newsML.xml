<p>Middle East very large crude carrier rates were steady to firm on Tuesday, with some brokers expecting levels to rise in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of business and a very small list of tonnage,&quot; one broker said. &quot;We are hoping for better things to come from an owner's point of view.&quot;</p>
<p>He assessed Mideast/Japan rates slightly higher at W62.5 against W60 on Monday, with trips west at W55-57.5 and to Singapore at W57.5.</p>
<p>Caribs/upcoast 70,000 tonne cargoes continued to push up, reaching W197.5-200, against about W180 last week and an average of just W143.48 in the period Feb 10-March 7, according to Reuters Tanker Industry Index (punch in RTII9 and Enter).</p>
<p>The West Africa/U.S. sector also had a firm tone, with million barrel (130,000 tonne) cargoes at W100/105 and VLCCs at W70/72.5, brokers said. Also from West Africa, the million-barrel Poitou was fixed to U.K./Cont at W105 for Dreyfus, loading March 30.</p>
<p>Most other sectors were steady and quiet, with inter-U.K./ Cont 80,000 tonne fixtures in a wide W120-W140 range depending on vessel quality and dates. Cross-Med 80,000 tonne vessels remained at W105/110 and million barrel ships at W102.5-105.</p>
<p>One Cont/Med fixture was seen, the 132,000 tonne Nikator on a voyage Hound Point/Lavera at W100 for Total, loading March 27.</p>
<p>The North Sea/U.S. sector was quiet, with VLCCs continuing to be assessed at W65 and 130,000 tonners at W95.</p>
<p>Inter-U.K./Cont 25,000 tonne fuel oil cargoes were steady at W190, while cross-Med rates dipped to W220 from W225.</p>
