<p>Hours before the Hong Kong handover, the United States and Britain jointly urged China on Monday to maintain freedom in this Asian economic powerhouse as it comes under Beijing's control.</p>
<p>&quot;We are both confident that Hong Kong can have a prosperous future and a free future if the terms of the (1984 Sino-British) Joint Declaration are adhered to,&quot; said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.</p>
<p>He spoke after conferring on the royal yacht Britannia with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>In particular, Cook said the two ministers remain concerned that the elected Hong Kong legislature will be disbanded at midnight and replaced with an assembly named at Beijing's direction, pending fresh elections.</p>
<p>Cook, Albright and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are boycotting the swearing-in ceremony although lower, but still senior-ranked, officials will be present.</p>
<p>The two ministers renewed calls for post-handover polls &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; They made no reference to a reported pledge on Sunday by China's anointed Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa to hold elections by next May.</p>
<p>Cook also said Britain wants &quot;a new start with Beijing ... to deal with each other as major players on the international scene and as countries that have quite a strong and developing economic link.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Central to that relationship will be Hong Kong ... potentially a bridge not a barrier between ourselves and China,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Albright, standing at the dockside with Cook for a brief news conference, joined the foreign secretary &quot;in expressing our expectation that China will keep its word and maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life for decades to come.&quot;</p>
<p>They repeated concerns over Beijing's decision to send in 4,000 Chinese troops hours when Hong Kong reverts at midnight to China after more than 150 years under British rule.</p>
<p>And Cook stressed that Chinese troops should not be seen on Hong Kong streets &quot;where they have no place and no right&quot; under the Basic Law, part of the legal framework that set terms for the transition of power.</p>
<p>But he also argued for a &quot;proper balance&quot; in considering the handover and the uncertainty of what Chinese control will actually mean.</p>
<p>&quot;One issue that does encourage me is that there is more confidence in Hong Kong's future than any of us could necessarily have predicted five years ago,&quot; Cook said.</p>
<p>Albright heaped praise on Britain, saying the U.S. ally should be proud of the legacy it leaves behind in Hong Kong &quot;one of the wonders of the world, a society that is proud, prosperous, safe and free.&quot;</p>
