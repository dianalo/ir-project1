<p>Croatian economy will grow a solid five percent this year but this figure might well be overshot, a senior International Monetary Fund (IMF) official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy seems reasonably poised to achieve at least a five percent real growth. Based on the data we have seen so far, even a seven-percent growth is a definite possibility,&quot; chief of an IMF mission to Croatia, Robert Feldman, told reporters.</p>
<p>Feldman said the IMF team could only review partial indicators, including the industrial output rise. But he added that there were no actual accounts showing a rise of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) since the first quarter.</p>
<p>Retail price inflation of 3.5 percent to August was in line with expectations, Feldman said. He praised the kuna exchange rate stability, shrinking of the external debt on the current account and rising international reserves.</p>
<p>While being more conservative during a previous mission in June, his current comments seemed to support the official forecasts of 5-7 percent real GDP growth.</p>
<p>Recently, the government has been even more optimistic, upgrading a previous GDP increase to seven percent and more.</p>
<p>It has based its estimates on what was described as a strong recovery in key industrial branches, buoyant tourist performance and public sector activities.</p>
<p>Although it shrank 1.2 percent in August from July, the industrial output, accounting for one third of GDP, was up 2.3 percent in the first eight months of 1996 compared to the year-ago period. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
