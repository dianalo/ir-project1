<p>Militias backing Congo's current and former presidents put down their arms on Wednesday for a 72-hour ceasefire, giving a fillip to peacemakers trying to extinguish a ferocious 12-day war.</p>
<p>&quot;It's incredibly quiet, it's amazing,&quot; Darcy Christen of the international Red Cross (ICRC) said by telephone from the heart of the city that has been fragmented into opposing camps by fighting since June 5.</p>
<p>The truce came into force at midnight local time (2300 GMT Tuesday) for three days.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy took advantage of the lull to close. The ambassador and his personnel were flown out just across the Congo river to Kinshasa, capital of the former Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;They've all gone and are now safely in Kinshasa,&quot; said a remaining security guard at the embassy. He said the only firing involved looters stripping the city centre of the little that was left after days of pillage.</p>
<p>As the Americans left, the United Nations special envoy for the region, Mohamed Sahnoun, flew in to press ahead with peace talks that stalled on Monday in Libreville in neighbouring Gabon.</p>
<p>France's ambassador Raymond Cesaire said Sahnoun would meet President Pascal Lissouba, whose authority has shrunk to a central part of town, and his rival Denis Sassou Nguesso.</p>
<p>&quot;He will try to overcome some of the obstacles that we encountered...in the talks. The rest of the negotiators are in Libreville awaiting the outcome of Sahnoun's visit,&quot; U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Forces loyal to Lissouba and to the man he succeeded as president in free elections five years ago, former Marxist military leader Sassou Nguesso, started fighting as tensions rose ahead of presidential elections set for July 27.</p>
<p>The battle for the city of a million people, between Lissouba's government forces and &quot;Zulu&quot; militia and Nguesso's &quot;Cobras&quot;, has left hundreds dead and scuppered plans for the poll in which the two men were leading contenders with Brazzaville mayor Bernard Kolelas.</p>
<p>Rocket launchers and heavy artillery have been used in the battles for control which have proven as yet inconclusive.</p>
<p>The Red Cross's Christen, whose team was promised free passage in Brazzaville as part of the ceasefire deal, said his priority was to bring help to the unknown number of wounded.</p>
<p>He said 200 bodies were picked up in the first 48 hours of the fighting alone but many more remained in the streets.</p>
<p>Cesaire hosted more talks on Wednesday between military leaders of the factions as well as a meeting of a political mediation committee led by Kolelas, the city's third force whose militia have stayed out of the fray.</p>
<p>Washington decided to close its embassy because France's 1,250 soldiers, who evacuated over 5,500 foreigners from the city and afforded some degree of protection, are pulling out.</p>
<p>Most had gone by Wednesday and French officials say they will all be out by Saturday from the former capital of French Equatorial Africa in an operation made easier by the ceasefire.</p>
<p>The airport, which the French had been guarding, is in the firing line in the city that until recently seemed like a haven of peace while war raged in neighbouring Zaire.</p>
<p>Under the truce accord the airport should be treated as a neutral zone and be used for humanitarian purposes.</p>
<p>Sahnoun and other mediators are trying to find at least a temporary solution to stop fighting flaring again at the weekend when the truce is over and the French gone.</p>
<p>Paris has so far been deaf to Lissouba's entreaties that its troops should stay to keep the peace, either alone or as part of an international force.</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso, who ran the country from 1979 until 1992, told French radio he was not opposed to an international force.</p>
