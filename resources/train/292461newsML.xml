<title>SINGAPORE: Rumours of big LME copper stock rise swirl in Asia.</title>
<headline>Rumours of big LME copper stock rise swirl in Asia.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-01-07</dateline>

<p>Far East base metal dealers said on Tuesday that they expected a jump in London Metal Exchange (LME) copper stocks later in the day, but doubted the rise would be as high as the 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes predicted in the U.S.</p>
<p>Most Singapore-based metal dealers forecast a more modest increase of between 5,000-10,000 tonnes with one senior trader for a European metal trading firm pegging it at 2,000 tonnes up. The LME stock report is due out at 0900 GMT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a large increase today...anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes,&quot; Vinod Kumar, director of Singapore metal firm Donald Mcarthy told Reuters. &quot;It could be 15 (thousand).&quot;  </p>
<p>Rumours of a sharp increase in stocks, based on the possible movement of up to 10,000 tonnes of copper into the LME warehouse in Long Beach, California, wiped out market gains in the red metal overnight in New York and drove COMEX copper prices lower. &quot;I'm not sure about the rumours, but copper is due up,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>The trader in the European metal dealing company said he has heard about the reports of a large increase in copper stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be unchanged to 2,000 tonnes up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>LME copper stocks fell 2,125 tonnes last Friday, January 3, the first time in a month that inventories have fallen.  </p>
<p>The volume of copper in the LME warehouse in Singapore slipped 200 tonnes to 29,900 last Friday. Copper stocks in the LME warehouse here had previously climbed with the arrival of metal shipments from China.</p>
<p>Kumar predicted the amount of copper in the LME's Singapore warehouse would probably rise by between 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Dealers estimated about 5,000 tonnes of copper remains off LME warrant in Singapore, dealers said.</p>
<p>Total LME aluminium stocks could either rise or fall by 2,000 tonnes, traders predicted. The last LME stocks report showed aluminium inventories rose by 4,575 tonnes.  </p>
<p>Metal business in the city-state remained thin with Japanese trading houses only beginning to take a look at the market after the long Christmas and New Year holiday period.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the Japanese come back in and start doing their New Year business, the market will get more volume. Until they do so, it's a bit thin,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Three-month copper prices were quoted by regional dealers at 0200 GMT at around US$2,175/80 a tonne, slightly lower compared to the late London trade on Monday of $2,179/83 a tonne.  </p>
<p>Aluminium was seen at around $1,548/53 a tonne at 0200 GMT against the close in London yesterday of $1,552 a tonne, dealers said.</p>
