<text>
<p>U.S. crude differentials eased late Tuesday on softer refinery runs while outright prices were only modestly lower tracking crude futures.</p>
<p>In addition to a weekend fire at BP's Toledo, Ohio, refinery, which left more crude supplies for Midwest markets, the American Petroleum Institute (API) report showed a drop in crude runs to 92.7 percent, down 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>A combination of problems at BP's refinery and scheduled autumn turnarounds was seen slowing near-term demand.</p>
<p>November West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was at $25.40-50 a barrel, down five cents from Monday's cash market.  </p>
<p>Domestic crude prices held to a steady erosion over the day led lower by the stumble in Light Louisiana Sweet.</p>
<p>&quot;The ramifications of BP's problems took the grades lower,&quot; an oil broker said.</p>
<p>BP said Tuesday there were no changes in the status of the 155,000 barrels per day (bpd) Toledo facility, where crude runs were curtailed by a fire on Saturday.</p>
<p>Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James eased from the morning's 54-cents premium level against WTI, to 52 cents later, down from highs on Monday at 65 cents. Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire traded at 40 cents, down nine cents from previous trade.</p>
<p>Midland/WTI also drifted lower, selling at four cents over WTI, compared with seven cents earlier.</p>
<p>Heavier grades like West Texas Sour/Midland declined to minus $1.38, off six cents from earlier morning levels.</p>
<p>The API report for crude was neutral with slight draws in most regions and a total draw of 417,000 barrels nationwide.</p>
<p>But the market's obsession with shortages of heating oil, coupled with a fall in crude runs, were viewed likely to keep the crude and products uptrend broadly intact.</p>
