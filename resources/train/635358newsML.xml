<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spots up.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spots up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-06-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down in slow trading on Tuesday mainly due to ample fund supply on the market on a slowdown in new domestic A share issues, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded three-day contract plunged to 5.8 percent from 10.1 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell to 3.2 million lots from 5.5 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.  </p>
<p>Traders said a lack of new share issues from Monday to Wednesday on the domestic A share markets saw money supply far exceed demand on the repo market.</p>
<p>The repo rates are likely to rebound on Wednesday due to a number of new A share issues on the Shanghai stock exchange on Thursday and Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up on Tuesday on a technical rebound supported by the contracts' high yields of more than 10 percent on average, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 rose to 121.39 yuan from 121.21 yuan.  </p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market fell sharply to 827,984 lots from 1.4 million lots.</p>
<p>Traders said the high yields supported the contracts to stage a rebound despite a lack of liquidity on the spot market with active domestic share markets sucking money out.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the spot contracts to move narrowly around the current level in the next few days.</p>
