<p>British longhaul airline Virgin Atlantic Airways accused British Airways Plc on Tuesday of having secret plans to team up with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV and Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) as part of its globalisation strategy.</p>
<p>Branson told reporters that Virgin had reason to believe  BA had outline agreements in place with both KLM and JAL but wanted to secure regulatory approvals for its contested alliance with AMR Corp's American Airlines first.</p>
<p>BA said it would not comment on the speculation.</p>
<p>Branson said Virgin had already correctly predicted proposed link-ups by BA and American with Spanish carrier Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA, which were announced publicly a month ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Like Iberia, we believe they (BA) have an understanding that once they have got the American deal through they will do similar agreements with JAL and KLM,&quot; he told reporters at a company press conference.</p>
<p>There has long been speculation that BA has been looking at teaming up with the Dutch and Japanese airlines to add to its global reach, but the companies routinely decline to comment.</p>
<p>&quot;We never comment on speculation about possible alliances, acquisitions or mergers,&quot; said a BA spokesman.  </p>
<p>Branson was speaking after meeting with the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which was visiting London to hear local views about the proposed alliance with American.</p>
<p>Under the proposed alliance, BA intends to co-ordinate its 244 flights a week to 22 U.S. destinations with American's 238 flights from seven U.S. airports to 12 European destinations.</p>
<p>But Virgin and other rival airlines as well as consumer groups have all objected to the deal, alleging that it would dominate Europe's biggest trans-Atlantic market, with over 60 percent of all flights between Britain and the U.S.</p>
<p>Branson said he told the U.S. Congress members that BA and American together would control 80 percent of the peak-time take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow for trans-Atlantic traffic and said it would be &quot;the merger from hell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fares will go up and the quality of service will go down if the merger is allowed,&quot; he said. &quot;The whole thing is completely unrealistic...They are just far too big to be allowed to get together,&quot; Branson said.</p>
<p>Later BA chief executive Robert Ayling accused Virgin of being &quot;afraid of new competition,&quot; in opposing the American alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;Virgin wants to maintain its cosy position at Heathrow, with access denied to airlines such as Continental, US Airways, Delta, TWA and Northwest,&quot; Ayling said in a statement after his own meeting this morning with the Congressional committee.</p>
<p>BA and American argue that the deal would lead to lower fares because it would only go ahead if Britain and the U.S. first agreed a new open skies aviation trade pact to open up the market to free competition.</p>
<p>Under the current Bermuda II trade pact only BA, American, United Airlines and Virgin are allowed to use London Heathrow for trans-Atlantic services.</p>
<p>Currently, the other airlines have to operate London services out of Gatwick, which they say is less popular, particularly for transfer traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;The entry of these (other) airlines will see an inevitable fall in air fares from Heathrow to the USA as competition for business increases,&quot; Ayling said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it appears that Virgin is afraid of increased competition.&quot;</p>
<p>Virgin denied the charge, saying that it opposed the deal because there was no room to expand at Heathrow unless BA and American give up hundreds of runway slots as well as ground facilities to their rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;Virgin welcomes competition, provided it is fair competition; always has and always will,&quot; Branson said.</p>
