<p>The creation of a single European currency could prompt participating national central banks to sell excess dollar and gold reserves, a new study by Goldman Sachs in London showed on Monday.</p>
<p>At the expected start of economic and monetary union (EMU) in 1999, a European Central Bank (ECB) will likely be saddled with far more foreign exchange and gold reserves than it needs for trade or currency management purposes, the study argues.</p>
<p>Comprised of reserves held by national central banks joining EMU, Goldman Sachs reckons the surplus available to the ECB could be as high as 45 to 75 billion Ecu.</p>
<p>While the extra reserves could be unwound gradually by participating governments using them to reduce their outstanding debt, there is a risk of some of it being sold in the marketplace -- the vast amount of which are dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;It is most likely that only a subset of EU countries will join EMU at the outset,&quot; the study says, with Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland and Ireland cited as the most likely entrants.</p>
<p>&quot;This group of countries had foreign exchange reserves in non-EU currencies of just over 100 billion Ecu at the end of 1995. If the ECB accumulates reserves of 50 billion Ecu, this would free up U.S. dollar reserves of 54 billion Ecu.&quot;</p>
<p>If one includes gold reserves, the surplus would rise to almost 120 billion Ecu, the study added.</p>
<p>Since national central banks will be under strict restrictions on their ability to manage and use their foreign exchange reserves independently, there would be little reason for them to hold reserve at all, the study says.</p>
<p>They will not have any responsibilites for intervening on foreign exchange markets, for example.</p>
<p>An important uncertainty, however, is the appropriate level of reserves the ECB should hold for trade and currency management purposes. At the moment this issue is undecided, but the Maastricht treaty envisages the ECB accumulating reserves up to 50 billion Ecu.</p>
