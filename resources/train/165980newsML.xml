<p>Getting help to a million Rwandan refugees in Zaire is the top priority of an African summit in Kenya on Tuesday which should also urge the refugees to go home, the head of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) said.</p>
<p>Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the pan-African body, said regional leaders meeting in Kenya would also try to promote a ceasefire in eastern Zaire, where Tutsi rebels have seized a string of border towns, blocking aid to the refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;First we must open corridors to ensure supplies and, second, create the conditions so the refugees can return to Rwanda. That is the most important issue to help find a lasting solution,&quot; Salim told Reuters before the Nairobi summit began.</p>
<p>Zaire, crucial to any solution of the crisis, refused to join leaders from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, Zambia, Eritrea and Cameroon at the one-day talks.</p>
<p>&quot;If the summit comes out with a clear message on a cessation of hostilities and the return of refugees, it will have begun the process,&quot; Salim said.</p>
<p>Part of solving the refugee crisis would be finding a way for &quot;the separation of the intimidators&quot;, he added.</p>
<p>Among the Rwandan Hutu refugees are tens of thousands of militiamen blamed for the 1994 genocide of up to a million Tutsis and other victims in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Aid agencies have accused them of using the innocent refugees as a shield to protect themselves and allow them to operate as an army in exile, fed by the outside world.</p>
<p>Rwanda says it wants the Hutu refugees to come home but they have refused all blandishments to do so since 1994, fearing they will join the 80,000 Hutu genocide suspects in Rwanda's jails.</p>
<p>Instead, they appear to be heading west, deeper into Zaire and away from the easiest aid routes.</p>
<p>Asked if the regional leaders would deal with Rwanda's alleged military involvement in Zaire on the side of the rebels, Salim said &quot;We will discuss everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is unfortunate that Zaire could not be here,&quot; Salim said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the very fact the summit is taking place is important as it demonstrates our concern, but most importantly it will deal with both the political and humanitarian issues.&quot;</p>
<p>The OAU chief said he had been in contact with European Union officials and the foreign ministers of Italy and Germany to coordinate efforts to help the abandoned refugees.</p>
<p>France said on Tuesday it received positive international reaction to a Franco-Spanish call for a U.N.-sanctioned military force to guarantee the refugees' safety.</p>
