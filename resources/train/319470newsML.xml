<p>Turkey will reach its target of $5 billion in privatisation revenues this year if there are no legal obstacles to sell offs, State Minister Ufuk Soylemez said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason at all not to reach this target as long as there are no legal problems,&quot; Soylemez told reporters.</p>
<p>Privatisation officials said the $5 billion did not include $3.5 billion expected to be raised from the sale of Turk Telekom, the keystone of Turkey's privatisation efforts, and revenue from the sale of power plants.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court is to begin meeting on Tuesday to decide on an opposition request to cancel the sale of Telekom. A decision is expected within several days.</p>
<p>The government hopes to raise $3.5 billion from Telekom, the sale of which has already been halted three times by the court since 1993.</p>
<p>Soylemez said the first tranche of up to 15 percent of the telecommunications giant would be sold by the end of the year if the court gave the green light.</p>
<p>&quot;I am hoping it will not be another cancellation,&quot; he said after the tender for the state-run Etibank.</p>
<p>Turkish textile firm Dogan Kumascilik put in the highest Etibank bid at $185 million but it was still to be approved by the High Board of Privatisation.</p>
<p>Soylemez, whose ministerial portfolio includes privatisation, said the board, headed by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, would rule on all outstanding bids by the end of January.</p>
<p>Turkish privatisation, which has garnered only $3 billion in the last 10 years, has gathered pace in recent months under Erbakan's Islamist-conservative government.</p>
