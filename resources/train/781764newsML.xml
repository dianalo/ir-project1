<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah stable in late trading.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah stable in late trading.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-08-06</dateline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in late trading on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>One European bank dealer said trading seemed to have slowed down in the past three days, with the rupiah seen stabilising in a range around 2,600 to the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know whether this is the equilibrium for now. But we see sustained offshore selling interest in dollars because they are looking for attractive papers,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,593.0/95.0 at 0930 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,597.0/2,602.0. Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,592.25/94.25 and 2,592.0/95.0, respectively.  </p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said, however, domestic dollar buying interest continued, preventing a downward dollar correction.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar would have adjusted down quicker but local demand on dollars remains strong,&quot; the dealer said, adding that high short-term rates were likely to be retained as long as the domestic dollar appetite continued high.</p>
<p>But one state bank dealer said he expected the rupiah to strengthen to 2,570 by the end of the week, and if the region continued its stabilisation against the dollar, the 2,550 target was not beyond reach.  </p>
<p>Dealers said global upbeat sentiment towards the dollar limited a broad recovery of regional currencies.</p>
<p>The state bank dealer said 'good name' foreign fund managers were looking to lock in current attractive rupiah yields for up to two years, suggesting an overall perception that high short-term rates would not last for long.</p>
<p>The temporary nature of the expensive rupiah policy was also reflected by inverse interest rates in the money market where short-term rates were higher than long-term ones.</p>
<p>The central bank has maintained a high interest rate policy in the short-term to reduce speculative dollar buying.  </p>
<p>The bank offered overnight bilateral SBIs at 14.0 percent, two-to-six day at 15.0 percent, one-week at 10.0 percent, two-week at 10.5 percent, one-month at 11.125 percent, three at 11.0, six at 11.625 and one-year at 12.25 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were not clear how long the policy of expensive short-term rates would last, but it would be necessary until the market regained full confidence.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said offshore fund managers were eyeing local 'good name' papers yielding some 18 percent in the bond market, suggesting a possible gradual recovery.  </p>
<p>&quot;The central bank is in a kind of dilemma. It has to keep short-term interest rates high to contain speculative dollar buying. But on the other hand, this will soon induce inflows of hot money the central bank dislikes,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, prolonged high short-term rates would hurt the economy. It's a difficult balancing act,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was at 0.70/0.75 and tom/next at 0.6/0.65.</p>
<p>One-month swap was at 20.0/24.0, two at 40.0/43.0, three at 60.0/66.0 and six at 121.0/125.0 points.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its intervention band at 2,378/2,682 but lowered the conversion band to 2,572/2,620 on Wednesday from 2,576/2,624 on Tuesday -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
