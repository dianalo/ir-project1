<p>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said on Thursday it was time to live up to promises to enlarge the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) despite Russian misgivings.</p>
<p>He said he backed membership by the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Romania, though he recognised they would not all be able to join in the first stage of expanding the alliance.</p>
<p>Chretien, addressing a joint news conference with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, used the Czech Republic as an example.</p>
<p>&quot;The time has come for us to live up to our promise. When the Czech Republic decided to become a democracy and to become a market economy, we said clearly at the time that it should become a member of NATO one day,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turning to Klaus, he added: &quot;So we hope the decision will be made, and you can count on our support on that...I know that the Czech Republic is always at the top of the list.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia has protested that an enlarged NATO would threaten its security. Chretien said: &quot;We understand the Russian position very well. But we are not seeking to do anything against Russia.&quot;</p>
<p>Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic expect to be among the first former Soviet satellites to be invited, at NATO's Madrid summit in July, to start entry talks.</p>
<p>Klaus said the issue of his country joining was simply a matter of being invited, rather than having to beef up its defences.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision is on the other side, simply being invited to join NATO. It's not an issue of having two or three more or better planes, jets or something like that. It's not a technical issue,&quot; said Klaus.</p>
<p>He arrived on Thursday at the head of a trade mission to Canada and is due to leave on Sunday.</p>
