<title>USA: INSIGHT--Mark crosses to punish dollar/mark.</title>
<headline>INSIGHT--Mark crosses to punish dollar/mark.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-08-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>After getting a boost versus the yen from a weak Japanese economic report, the dollar may be, this time, at the mercy of the mark's fortune.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen climbed on Wednesday as Japan's Tankan or Beige Book depicted an unexpectedly bearish mood among businesses.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen ended the American session at 108.42/47 after testing 108.50 resistance. Clearing that level, analysts say, would leave the field open for a run at 108.70, then 109.15.</p>
<p>But it was the mark that benefitted the most from the yen's demise, garnering additional momentum from the Tankan's effect on the European crosses.  </p>
<p>&quot;What seems to have had an effect on dollar/mark is that mark/yen broke a two-month trendline at around 73 the figure,&quot; said analyst Ben Morden at I.D.E.A. &quot;Mark/yen could be an important cross rate tomorrow as it seems to still have the momentum to reach the cycle high at 73.78.&quot;</p>
<p>Dollar/mark closed virtually unchanged on Wednesday in New York at 1.4765/70.</p>
<p>Borden predicted dollar/mark would suffer from fresh mark/yen gains. The mark could also climb versus other Europeans, mainly the French franc or the Italian lira -- both vulnerable to budget deficit worries.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the loss of 1.4740/1.4715-mark area would pave the way for a slide to 1.4650 and 1.46. They also noted mark/Swiss is near 0.8080, a key level for future mark gains.</p>
<p>Borden said Swiss/yen is signaling a new mark/yen advance and thus more pressure on dollar/mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Swiss/yen is pushing above 91.40 which is, in itself, a confirmation of the mark/yen rally and a buy signal for mark/yen,&quot; Morden noted. &quot;We're seeing a lot of knock-on effects that began with the Tankan release.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark/Paris is also nearing the top of its old band in the European Rate Mechanism at 3.4305.  </p>
<p>The 3.4305 level is psychologically important due to market sentiment France wants to be in the European Monetary Union with mark/franc at a parity that would meet the old ERM standards.</p>
<p>&quot;It's important psychologically but also in terms of technical levels because that is close to 3.4285, a 10-month, 50-percent retracement level,&quot; Borden said of mark/Paris while noting &quot;this is precisely to the tick where we topped out today.&quot;</p>
