<title>RUSSIA: Lebed seeks approval for Chechnya peace plan.</title>
<headline>Lebed seeks approval for Chechnya peace plan.</headline>
<dateline>GROZNY, Russia 1996-08-26</dateline>

<p>Russian envoy Alexander Lebed, seeking top-level approval for his Chechnya peace plans, met Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday and is ready to meet President Boris Yeltsin, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin's office said they had no information about the president's plans for Monday. Yeltsin met new ministers in the Kremlin on Thursday but has not been seen in public since.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said Lebed and Chernomyrdin had discussed plans for a political and peaceful settlement in Chechnya, including proposals put forward by the separatists.</p>
<p>Lebed said on Sunday he would try to nail down the legal technicalities of Moscow's proposals for Chechnya's political future during his Moscow visit.</p>
<p>Russian news agencies said Chechnya was calm, although Interfax said one soldier was shot dead by a sniper and Russian positions came under fire 16 times.</p>
<p>&quot;This was, perhaps, the quietest night in the last year and a half,&quot; Tass quoted an Interior Ministry spokesman as saying.</p>
<p>Separatist fighters, determined to make a political point before Yeltsin was inaugurated for a second term in office on August 9, seized much of the Chechen capital Grozny on August 6 in a raid which humiliated the Russian military.</p>
<p>They still control much of the town and have said they are determined not to give in.</p>
<p>Interfax said on Monday that at least 450 Russian soldiers had been killed in the fighting and many were still missing.</p>
<p>Calm descended on Grozny last week after Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov agreed a ceasefire, setting up joint patrols in Grozny and withdrawing Russian troops from some areas.</p>
<p>Both sides say the truce has been broadly respected, although Russian military commanders say separatists seized guns and ammunition from a column of Russian soldiers on Saturday.</p>
<p>They say talks with Maskhadov will only be resumed after the weapons are returned.</p>
<p>The rebels have said that renegade groups seized the arms. But Interfax, quoting the separatist command, said almost all the weapons had been collected and they would be handed over on Monday, paving the way for talks to resume in Chechnya.</p>
<p>A rebel spokesman said Moscow had accepted the separatists' demand for a referendum, though possibly not for some years. The rebels say a free vote would back their goal of independence.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin said voters may one day decide Chechnya's future but stressed in a television interview on Sunday that Chechnya should stay an integral part of Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;The people must decide. As they decide, so it will be,&quot; he told Russian television.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;Chechnya should be part of the Russian Federation. That's simple. But when, how and with what status? It is essential not to decide that now.&quot;</p>
