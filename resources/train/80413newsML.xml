<p>An envoy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in an effort to calm the atmosphere following a day of bloodshed, a spokesman for Netanyahu said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Shai Bazak, on a European trip with Netanyahu, said Netanyahu's representative Yitzhak Molho met Arafat in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip on Wednesday night. &quot;They met in Gaza to talk about the current situation,&quot; he told reporters.  </p>
<p>Bazak spoke to reporters on Netanyahu's plane as it prepared to take off for Germany on the third and last stop of his first European swing since becoming prime minister in June.</p>
<p>Israeli officials travelling with Netanyahu said there were no plans to cut short the prime minister's visit. He was due in any event to return on Thursday night.</p>
<p>In Paris on Wednesday, Netanyahu said Arafat must try to calm tensions for the sake of peace.</p>
<p>Palestinians prepared to mark Netanyahu's 100 days in office on Thursday with protests, strikes and funerals for seven Arabs killed in clashes with Israeli troops on Wednesday. More than 300 Palestinians and several Israeli soldiers were wounded in the violence.</p>
