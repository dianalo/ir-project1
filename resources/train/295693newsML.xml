<title>ROMANIA: Bucharest bourse prices edge up, turnover down.</title>
<headline>Bucharest bourse prices edge up, turnover down.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-01-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prices on the Bucharest bourse continued to edge up on Thursday but turnover fell to 16.9 million lei, one quarter of the previous session level, amid thin trading interest.</p>
<p>Fertiliser maker Azomures SA stayed in the limelight of the exchange, gaining 1,200 lei to close at 14,300. It took some half of the 16.9 million lei turnover.</p>
<p>&quot;There were two buying orders for several thousands Azomures shares this session but sellers have waited for better prices. Consequently, only a few Azomures shares were sold and this affected turnover,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Turnover amounted to 70.1 million lei on Tuesday, the bourse's first session this year.</p>
<p>Except  Carbid Fox SA chemical products maker, which closed weaker at 2,150 lei from 2,350 and Eletroceramica SA  ELECT.BX insulator maker, which remained unchanged at 9,000 lei, all other prices closed stronger.</p>
<p>Three listings had no trades.</p>
<p>Operators said investors had adopted a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for other companies to join the 17 firms currently listed on the exchange.</p>
<p>Syringe maker  Sanevit SA remained suspended together with Foraj Sonde SA drilling company, pending announcements on their shareholders' meetings.</p>
<p>Two unofficial indices - the VAB, computed by  Vanguard SA and  Bucharest Investment Group 's BIG -- rose by 2.9 percent and 2.72 percent from the previous session.</p>
