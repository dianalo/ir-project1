<p>The Clinton White House held at least 58 receptions, meals and other events for Democratic Party donors and political supporters over the past four years, the Washington Post reported in Sunday editions.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the events were in addition to the 103 coffee meetings previously disclosed by the White House.</p>
<p>&quot;It's fair to say that these additional functions at the White House were for the purpose of encouraging support for the president's campaign, including financial support,&quot; White House special counsel Lanny Davis told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Republicans have urged Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel to investigate allegations of improper fundraising by President Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, including illegal contributions from foreign companies and many overnight stays at the White House.</p>
<p>Reviews of White House guest lists for political functions, released to a congressional committee last week, showed that guests at the coffees donated $27 million to the DNC. Overnight guests at the White House donated at least $6 million, the Post said.</p>
<p>The 58 White House events included more than 30 receptions, a $3,838 DNC tea in 1994, and a $2,294 Clinton-Gore luncheon last May.</p>
<p>The Post also quoted Lorraine Voles, spokeswoman for Vice President Al Gore, as saying that Gore's office discovered last week that the White House failed to seek proper reimbursement for 18 of 20 coffees he hosted in his office in the Old Executive Office Building.</p>
<p>Reimbursement bills weren't sent at all for 11 coffees and the costs for seven others were mistakenly billed to Gore's Senate account. Gore is president of the Senate.</p>
<p>&quot;We discovered an accounting error and we are moving quickly to correct the error,&quot; the Post quoted Voles as saying. &quot;We expect a full reimbursement very soon.&quot; The amount involved is estimated at about $500, the Post said.</p>
