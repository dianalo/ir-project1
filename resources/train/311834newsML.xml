<p>A giant submarine cable deal worth $720 million clinched by a consortium led by Japan's Kokusai Denshin Denwa was not seen as having any immediate impact on KDD's earnings, analysts said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the deal, which was won by a KDD-led consortium of international companies including AT&amp;T Submarine Cable Systems Inc, France's Alcatel and Maristel SpA of Italy, was in line with the carriers' long-term plans to boost submarine fibre capacity to cope with the Internet and other new services.</p>
<p>&quot;After the completion of investment plans on submarine fibre cables connecting Japan and the United States, they've finally turned to Asia, where construction of trunk lines is relatively delayed,&quot; said Hironori Tanaka, analyst at Yamaichi Research Institute.</p>
<p>A second cable contract, worth $80 million (corrects from $800 million) and connecting Singapore to Europe, was awarded to Fujitsu Ltd. Fujitsu was not available to comment on the impact of the deal on its earnings.</p>
<p>A third cable, between Singapore and various Asian countries including China and Japan, has not been awarded yet.  </p>
<p>Tanaka said the new cable's impact on the business of the world's largest telecommunications company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp's would be limited as NTT plans to lease lines from others in order to provide international service, rather constructing its own lines.</p>
<p>The three-part cable network, expected by analysts to bring down the cost of international phone calls, will strech for 38,000 km (23,600 miles) from the South Pacific to the North Atlantic, across Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The total cost to the 90 companies building it is $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>Shares of KDD ended up 120 yen at 7570 on Thursday, while Fujitsu closed up 30 at 1,120. NTT was up 8,000 at 849,000.</p>
