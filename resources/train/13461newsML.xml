<title>BOSNIA: Yugoslav trade mission arrives in Sarajevo.</title>
<headline>Yugoslav trade mission arrives in Sarajevo.</headline>
<dateline>SARAJEVO 1996-08-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Yugoslav trade mission flew into Sarajevo on Monday, the first such group to travel to the Bosnian capital since war broke out here in 1992.</p>
<p>Headed by Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, the Yugoslav mission reciprocated a Bosnian trade delegation which visited Belgrade on July 23.</p>
<p>According to the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug, Sainovic was scheduled to discuss normalising relations, and economic ties in particular, with officials from Bosnia's Moslem-Croat Federation.</p>
<p>Tanjug said the negotiations were a continuation of talks begun when Federation vice-President Ejup Ganic led Bosnia's July delegation.</p>
<p>The officials were also expected to discuss establishing a regular air links to Bosnia, Tanjug quoted the Federal Information Ministry as saying.</p>
<p>A group of 15 Yugoslav businessmen headed by President of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce is accompanying Sainovic on the trip which is scheduled to include a visit to the Serb- controlled city of Banja Luka later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia lost four of its six republics in recent years as Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Macedonia gained independence. Croatia and Bosnia fought protracted wars, in part against the republics of Serbia and Montenegro which remained as the new rump Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia and Croatia signed a mutual recognition accord on Friday, ending five years of hostility between those two countries.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia and Bosnia have not yet recognized one another, but the exchange of trade delegations is viewed by diplomats as a practical step in that direction and a further sign that stability is returning to the Balkans.</p>
