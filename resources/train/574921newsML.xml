<title>BULGARIA: Bulgaria to seek cheaper Russian gas.</title>
<headline>Bulgaria to seek cheaper Russian gas.</headline>

<p>Bulgaria is unhappy with the price it pays for Russian gas and plans to go shopping to get it cheaper, state monopoly Bulgargas said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The alternative sources are foreign firms which have loaned money to Russia's Gazprom and take part of their repayments in the form of gas, executive director Vasil Filipov told a press conference following publication of Bulgargas's annual report.</p>
<p>Filipov said that prices had risen an unrealistic 24 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Up to now we have been getting Russian natural gas at the Bulgarian border (with Romania) at the price of $107.6 per 1,000 cubic meters, while gas prices in Europe and Turkey are lower by $10 to $15.</p>
<p>&quot;Gazprom creditors offer us favourable prices and we will swing towards such suppliers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Until last month Bulgaria was getting about half its gas supplies from Russia without cash payment under a 10-year-old barter deal.</p>
<p>New barter deals are being developed but other imports are handled by joint Gazprom-Bulgargas ventures in which independent firms hold minority stakes.</p>
