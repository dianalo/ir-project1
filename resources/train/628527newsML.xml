<p>Karlsruhe claimed a place in next season's UEFA Cup thanks to a 1-1 draw with relegated Freiburg on the final day of the Bundesliga season.</p>
<p>The draw allowed Karlsruhe to jump into sixth place ahead of 1860 Munich who went down 3-0 away to Werder Bremen.</p>
<p>International wing-back Michael Tarnat, playing his last game for Karlsruhe before his move to champions Bayern Munich, gave his side the lead with a 15th minute header. Nikola Jurcevic equalised for Freiburg before the interval.</p>
<p>1860 were punished for some slack defending against Bremen, who led through Austrian international Andreas Herzog before substitute Bernd Hobsch added a double.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, we're disappointed we didn't make sixth place,&quot; 1860 coach Werner Lorant said. &quot;But if you concede three goals like those, then you've only got yourself to blame.&quot;</p>
<p>The Munich side must now hope that VfB Stuttgart, who finished the season in fourth place, beat regional league side Energie Cottbus in the German Cup final in two weeks.</p>
<p>A victory for Stuttgart would send them into the European Cup Winners' Cup, freeing up their UEFA Cup place for 1860.</p>
<p>The battle for sixth place was the only major issue left to be resolved on the final day of the season.</p>
<p>Bayern, who sealed the league title by beating Stuttgart last weekend, were unable to crown their season with a win. They had to be content with a 2-2 draw with Borussia Moenchengladbach.</p>
<p>Juergen Klinsmann put Bayern ahead in his last game for the club before joining Italy's Sampdoria. Moenchengladbach struck back through Stefan Passlack and Karlheinz Pflipsen before Christian Nerlinger salvaged a point for the champions.</p>
