<p>Bulgaria's Prime Minister Zhan Videnov said on Monday the government and the central bank accepted a tough currency regime prescribed by the International Monetary Fund to stabilise its crumbling financial system.</p>
<p>&quot;The government together with the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) plan to inform their partners, the International Monetary Fund, that we have accepted the currency board idea,&quot; Videnov told a news conference.</p>
<p>Under the currency board system, the exchange rate is pegged at a fixed level against a hard currency and money in circulation has to correspond to the official hard currency reserves at that rate.</p>
<p>Also, the system deprives the central bank of powers to freely set interest and exchange rates and its authority is replaced by a body that ensures es compliance with the terms.</p>
<p>Videnov said the government was planning to invite an IMF mission for technical preparation of the currency board system which would peg money in ciruculation to the level of hard currency reserves.</p>
<p>A later mission would be invited for official negotiations, he added.</p>
<p>By early January the cabinet will prepare and introduce to parliament for approval a package of laws that include the 1997 budget frame and amendments to the central bank law curbing its operations so the currency board can function, said Videnov.</p>
<p>Some 60 percent of next year's draft budget expenses are expected to cover foreign debt payments, said Videnov.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a brutal budget, it means that we have 40 percent left for police, healthcare, the army, education and other spending,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bulgaria was likely to resume debt rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of government creditors in the first quarter of next year, said Videnov.</p>
<p>Total foreign debt payments due next year top $1 billion.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Dimitar Kostov said he would propose to parliament to consider depositing abroad Bulgaria's strategic gold reserves worth around $400 million, now kept in the vaults of the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;If it was deposited abroad, Bulgaria could earn around $20 million interest,&quot; Kostov told the same news conference.</p>
<p>He said preliminary estimates showed that money in circulation, which included commercial banks' minimum reserves held at the BNB, amounted to 165 billion levs.</p>
<p>These would have to be matched by BNB foreign exchange reserves of slightly more than $500 million and additional support from the IMF.</p>
<p>Videnov said the amount of IMF support which the government would request would &quot;sufficient, but such that it would not place Bulgaria in a debt trap&quot;. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Videnov said the government would need external support for the next three to four months until the currency board is implemented.</p>
<p>&quot;We would rely on funding not only from the IMF but also from the European Union and the G-7 (group of industrial nations),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Currency boards, usually pegging the local currency to the dollar, have been used to defeat hyperinflation and restore confidence in countries like Argentina, Estonia, and Lithuania.</p>
