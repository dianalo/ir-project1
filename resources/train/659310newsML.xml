<p>Thai stocks ended at new 97-month lows on Friday on sustained absence of foreign investors and liquidation of bank stocks hit by weak earnings and low-quality assets, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite SET index finished 4.16 points off at 515.60 on moderate 4.0 billion baht turnover. The SET-50 index dropped 0.21 points to 36.67.</p>
<p>&quot;The current situation is very unfavourble to bank earnings. The non-performing loans problem also remained a major concern,&quot; said an analyst at United Securities.  </p>
<p>The broker said the central bank measures to curb baht supply for currency speculators would raise the cost of offshore funding of Thai banks.</p>
<p>Some banks have in the past week delayed plans to float foreign bonds, putting them off until improvement of economic and money market conditions.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand has curbed offshore baht supply since the currency came under market attack in mid-May.  </p>
<p>Foreign investors also remained on the sidelines after the central bank adopted measures to prevent foreign investors from raising baht through the stock market early this week, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bangkok Bank topped the active list, finishing four baht off at 139, Thai Farmers Bank eased one to 92, and Siam Commercial Bank fell one to 100.</p>
<p>TelecomAsia gained one to 25.25, and Siam Cement lost six to close at 430.</p>
