<headline>Saga defends Santa Fe purchase price.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-04</dateline>

<p>Saga Petroleum ASA at a news conference here on Wednesday dismissed criticism that it was paying too high a price for Santa Fe Exploration which it bought for $1.23 billion from Kuwait Petroleum Corp.</p>
<p>Saga, Norway's largest independent oil firm, said it concluded the price was right after elaborate research, which took into account Norwegian tax advantages and the prospects of raising production.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to compare portfolio's. It is a question of tax, of how much gas there is and how long the portfolio's life is,&quot; said Lars Bjerke, head of Saga exploration and research.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have done a much more sophisticated approach than a quick glance at the numbers and we are very confident that what we are paying reflects the true value,&quot; Bjerke added.</p>
<p>Analysts had earlier told Reuters that Saga was paying a seemingly full price for Santa Fe.</p>
<p>Under Norwegian tax law, Saga can deduct the interest it has to pay on the extra debt of about $600 million -- or half of the purchase price -- to help finance the Santa Fe acquisition.</p>
<p>&quot;There are also some good things about the Norwegian tax system,&quot; said Bjerke as he contrasted the deductibility of financing costs to Norway's notoriously high corporate tax.  </p>
<p>Referring to Saga's track record of boosting production by some 35 percent of recently acquired blocks in the Norwegian part of the North Sea, Bjerke said he was confident of raising Santa Fe's output too.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to continue to increase and grow production further both at Saga and Santa Fe,&quot; he said, adding that the Santa Fe acquisition would immediately lead to a significant increase in Saga's earnings per share.</p>
<p>Current production prognoses for the British North Sea fields in which Santa Fe has interests were &quot;very conservative&quot;, Bjerke said.  </p>
<p>Saga's experience with similar fields nearby on the Norwegian side would enable it to realise production increases which the other bidders for Santa Fe might not have achieved, another Saga executive said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the most competent of the companies that have been aggressive bidders for the (Santa Fe) portfolio,&quot; said reservoir engineering director Halvard Hoydalsik.</p>
<p>Saga confirmed Conoco, a subsidiary of DuPont Co from the U.S., had been a serious contender in the Santa Fe which was put up for sale in the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;The company suits us very well,&quot; said Bjerke.</p>
<p>Besides the North Sea blocks, Santa Fe's geological database is another valuable asset for Saga, he added. The database may prove a powerful weapon to obtain licences for exploration of new fields west of Ireland and near the Faroes and Shetland islands.</p>
<p>&quot;Santa Fe is a good attacking point in the next licencing rounds,&quot; said Bjerke.</p>
<p>&quot;Santa Fe will give us a springboard for further expansion in the North Sea and the Atlantic margin.&quot;</p>
<p>Saga expects the British authorities to give the green light to the Santa Fe purchase within two weeks.</p>
