<title>FRANCE: France confirms troop cuts in Africa.</title>

<p>French Defence Minister Alain Richard, confirming Paris will cut its troop levels in Africa, has said it will end nearly half a century of military intervention in the domestic affairs of its former colonies on the continent.</p>
<p>Richard, returning from a tour of Africa, told the daily Liberation in an interview published on Monday that France would cut its forces to less than 6,000 from 8,100.</p>
<p>The forces would be redeployed at five bases in Senegal, Gabon, Chad, Ivory Coast and Djibouti and the large Bouar base in the Central African Republic would be closed, he said.</p>
<p>The number of French combat planes based in Africa would be cut to a dozen from 15 while transport planes would be boosted to up to nine from the current six or seven.</p>
<p>Richard toured Gabon, Chad and the Central African Republic last week to start outlining troop cuts decided by the new Socialist government, which is keen to cut its spending on a continent that needs less policing after the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>France has launched an overhaul of the armed forces, including a shift to a smaller, all-professional force.</p>
<p>Richard said French forces would keep protecting French communities and ensuring stability, but without intervening in domestic disputes on the continent where Paris has often stepped in to prop up or topple African strongmen.</p>
<p>&quot;French military presence...helps to ensure, in full agreement with our partners, the security indispensible for economic and social development. But this stabilising mission will no longer involve arbitrating between rival forces,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Recent developments in the Congo, where Paris rejected calls from President Pascal Lissouba to intervene in his battle with former Marxist leader Denis Sassou Nguesso, illustrated France's future African policy, he said.</p>
<p>He said a French-backed African peacekeeping force set up in the Central African Republic to quell an army mutiny showed that &quot;Africans...are fully able to intervene themselves in a difficult, even serious situation.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Paris would keep up a dialogue with the United States and Britain, which are calling for inter-African peacekeeping forces to help settle crises on the continent.</p>
<p>As an example of western cooperation, he said the Franco-German Eurocorps brigade would stage its first African manoeuvres in Gabon in the fall.</p>
<p>Richard denied that Paris was concerned that U.S. influence in Africa was growing at the expense of France, saying he saw Washington as an ally rather than a rival.</p>
<p>&quot;I sincerely wish for Africa that the United States give it...substantial means to overcome its handicaps,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not see why France should be worried, as the need for cooperation is so large,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Paris has suffered a string of setbacks in Africa, culminating in this year's overthrow of long-term ally president Mobutu Sese Seko in what was Zaire by Laurent Kabila's forces.</p>
