<title>FRANCE: Havas has higher first half profit.</title>

<p>French media group Havas said on Thursday that it had posted a slight increase in its first-half profits and said it expected a rise in full-year results despite heavy investments in the audiovisual sector.</p>
<p>Net income after goodwill amortisations was 413 million francs for the first six months of 1996 against a pro-forma 406 million last year.</p>
<p>Havas recalculated its 1995 results to reflect the acquisition of the Generale Occidentale media interests from Alcatel-Alsthom.</p>
<p>Before the goodwill writedown, net income was up by one percent to 517 million francs from 512 million.</p>
<p>Sales were 8.9 percent higher at 23.78 billion francs.</p>
<p>Havas said that despite uncertainties surrounding European economic trends, the group's markets should expand in 1996 with the exception of book publishing.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result, net income, group share, should show a rise despite heavy investments in the audiovisual sector,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said its operating income declined 5.1 percent to 443 million francs. It said changes in methods for recording revenues at Havas Media Communications had a negative impact of 37 million in the first half but this would have no effect on the full year figures.</p>
<p>&quot;The decline in operating income with comparable accounting methods results from lower contractual rates of remuneration on intermediation services in Germany and slacker trends in publishing, although these were partly offset by gains in local media (outdoor) and tourism,&quot; Havas said.</p>
<p>It said it had non-operating income of 192 million francs, before taxes, compared to 115 million last year.</p>
<p>It said this was due to a 219 million franc capital gain made on the sale of 50 percent of its stake in Capital Radio in Britain, and a gain of 163 million representing Havas's stake in a CLT asset gain on selling 60 percent in Telestar as well as its former headquarters.</p>
<p>This was partly offset by a charge of 139 million francs for the cancellation of the Club RTL digital TV project in Germany.</p>
