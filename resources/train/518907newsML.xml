<p>World sales initiatives by the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) were designed to increase revenue from its existing 20 percent share of world traded wheat, AWB chairman Trevor Flugge said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Australia averaged a world market share of 12 to 13 percent over the past five to six years, although this increased to 20 percent in 1996/97 (October-September) with prospective exports of 20 million tonnes, Flugge told Reuters in an interview.  </p>
<p>But Australia was unlikely to be able to increase its world market share because it doubted it could sustain production at 24 million tonnes over a five-year average, Flugge said.</p>
<p>Production in the recent past had averaged 15 million tonnes to 16 million tonnes, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market share we have now is the market share we can retain,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the AWB's push into branded wheat, unveiled on Wednesday, was designed to produce more money for the wheat it sold, he said.  </p>
<p>Flugge said Australia would come under pressure if reasonable crops were produced elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no doubt these guys will come out with all guns firing and in most cases they will use money to beat us.&quot;</p>
<p>AWB had produced branded wheat partly in an effort to beat U.S. and European subsidies through improving the product, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americans and to a lesser extent the Canadians, but the Europeans, they literally say 'if we want extra market share, we'll just pay for it', and they've done that through their subsidy programme,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;If it's a reasonable sized crop in the U.S. and they find demand is not giving them their market share back, I believe they will introduce it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>If so, this could occur by the next Australian spring, he said.</p>
<p>Flugge said he was about to argue very strongly in the U.S. that EEP be kept out of certain markets, which had not so far been distorted.</p>
<p>He would raise this in the U.S. in June with Congressmen, Senators and the Administration itself, he said.  </p>
<p>Flugge said he was wary of the possibility of U.S. and European Union (EU) subsidies being reintroduced or increased on wheat sales, with much riding on the 1997 U.S. crop, he said.</p>
<p>With U.S. stocks at very low levels, an average to good crop would allow the U.S. to begin to re-build stocks, he said.</p>
<p>But the U.S. would also want to attempt to retrieve market share which it had lost.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's not available to them through demand, then they'll buy it back ... by throwing a little bit of EEP (export enhancement programme subsidies) at it,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Arguing that the AWB's export monopoly gave it the market power to win against international competitors, Flugge said the Canadians, Argentinians, Americans, Europeans all looked at Australia as a &quot;very aggressive competitor&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;(The U.S. is) so far behind it's not funny,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're hitting a peak, we're in front, but we can't be complacent (and will) work like hell to make sure we keep in front of the field,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Australia's weak point was the variability of its production, primarily the result of recurrent drought, he said.  </p>
<p>Arguing that the AWB monopoly on export sales was a &quot;disciplined system of marketing&quot;, Flugge said he did not see a future system for Australian wheat sales without &quot;some sort of discipline&quot;.</p>
<p>On world markets, Flugge also said India, a big unexpected buyer in 1996/97, was likely to be back in the market just as strongly in 1997/98.</p>
<p>India bought 3.0 million tonnes in 1996/97, 2.325 million tonnes of that from Australia and smaller tonnages from Canada and Argentina. Some assessors believed India would buy even greater tonnages in 1997/98, he said.  </p>
