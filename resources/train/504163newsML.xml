<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah firmer, focus on liquidity.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah firmer, focus on liquidity.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Indonesian rupiah was firmer against the dollar in dull late trading, with the focus on liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said there was some dollar selling ahead of the new bank reserve requirement rate next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there could be some pressure on the dollar next week if there is no disruption over the weekend,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Riots have erupted in at least four Central Java towns in the lead-up to the May election, but the market has been relatively calm. The latest violence was reported on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>One local bank dealer said sentiment on the rupiah improved late in the afternoon on fears of liquidity tightening due to weekly tax payments on Tuesday and new reserve rate on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the U.S. bank dealer said the dollar was well supported at the 2,406 level because of worries over possible fresh riots in the run-up to the general election on May 29.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,406.1/06.3 at 0900 GMT against an opening of 2,406.5/07.5. Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,405.7/05.9 and 2,405.0/05.3, respectively.  </p>
<p>Many dealers appeared to have discounted the effect from the new reserve rate but were reluctant to unload dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to short on dollars, but you have these small riots in central Java which frighten you away. They are not really significant but they are worrisome,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Dealers said short-term rates rose in the afternoon because of some delays in clearing. Overnight rupiah increased to 12.5 percent and tom/next swaps to 0.35/0.45 points.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not serious. It's just technical and not suggesting a trend,&quot; the local dealer said, referring to the clearing delays.  </p>
<p>The local bank dealer said one-week swaps were active amid a dull market because of the liquidity outlook.</p>
<p>One-week swap rose to 2.80/3.25 from 2.2/2.5.</p>
<p>One-month swaps edged up 11.75/12.50 from 11.50/12.25, two to 24.0/25.0 from 24.0/24.5, three to 34.5/35.5 from 34.25/35.50 and six to 71.0/72.0 from 70.50/71.00 points.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia kept the intervention band at 2,399/2,591 and the conversion band to 2,399/2,447 on Friday.</p>
