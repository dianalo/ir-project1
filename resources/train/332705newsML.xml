<headline>No evidence against Steffi Graf in tax case - judge.</headline>
<dateline>MANNHEIM, Germany 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>A German court trying Steffi Graf's father on tax evasion charges said on Friday it did not consider the tennis star herself guilty of any wrong-doing.</p>
<p>&quot;No active participation by Steffi Graf can be seen,&quot; presiding judge Joachim Plass told the court in the southwestern city of Mannheim.  </p>
<p>Plass was explaining his judgment after sentencing Graf's father to three years and nine months in prison for evading millions of marks (dollars) on his daughter's earnings between 1989 and 1993.</p>
<p>The world number one player had remained under investigation, but prosecutors had said the suspicions against her were not as serious as those against her father.</p>
<p>She has said she entrusted her financial affairs to her father from an early age and had little idea how her money was managed.</p>
