<p>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten on Thursday defended the integrity of his post-colonial successor, Tung Chee-hwa, over allegations that a donation to Britain's Conservative Party in 1992 was politically motivated.</p>
<p>Legislators questioned Patten, who was former Conservative Party chairman, on whether Tung's donation of 50,000 sterling (US$81,500) was a political transaction.</p>
<p>Tung, chosen by a China-assembled committee to run Hong Kong after the British pull out at midnight on June 30, admitted last week he gave the money to the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it would be a grotesque and wholly unwarranted attack on Mr Tung's integrity to suggest that there was any political transaction as a result of a donation that he made to the Conservative Party,&quot; Patten said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think that this controversy should be used by anybody to cast wholly unwarranted slurs on the I think unquestioned integrity of the chief executive-designate,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Tung, a former shipping tycoon, plans to ban foreign donations to local political organisation following Hong Kong comes under Chinese rule on July 1.</p>
<p>The donation provoked heavy criticism from Hong Kong's pro-democracy supporters. &quot;It's ridiculous that he is now banning people from doing what he himself has done before,&quot; Democratic Party legislator Cheung Man-kwong said.</p>
