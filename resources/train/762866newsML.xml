<p>A woman in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong killed herself, her lover and five others when she set off a bomb to take revenge on her boyfriend after the two had a quarrel, an official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The blast in Luoding city on Sunday injured two others, a local media official said by telephone.</p>
<p>The woman had been having an affair with a married man and detonated the bomb after the two had a falling out, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;They had some misunderstanding with each other and the girl set off a pack of dynamite in the room,&quot; he said, adding that the blast nearly demolished the three-storey building where they were staying.</p>
<p>The lovers and other dead and injured had been farmers from another province who came to Luoding in search of work, he said but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Chinese media often carry reports of bombings or revenge attacks carried out by jilted lovers or disgruntled workers.</p>
