<p>On the eve of its election victory one year ago, Spain's conservative Popular Party government won praise for what it considers one of its most glittering accomplishments -- an economic renaissance.</p>
<p>According to a new quarterly survey published on Sunday in the newspaper El Pais, a sizeable majority of Spanish businessman said the government was doing a good job managing the economy, which should continue to improve this year.</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 businessmen polled said the economy would pick up in the next 12 months, and they applauded the government's role -- with 59 percent categorising its performance as good or very good.</p>
<p>Last year, the Popular Party formed a minority government in May after winning the March 3 general election and promptly launched an economic clean-up to ensure it could meet its European goal of helping found the common currency in 1999.</p>
<p>To participate in the Euro's launch, Spain must adhere to strict criteria on inflation, long-term interest rates, currency and deficit and debt levels.</p>
<p>Sweeping aside 13 years of Socialist rule, the PP government pressed ahead with classic elements of conservative economic management, tightening the nation's fiscal strings and inaugurating a string of liberalisation members.</p>
<p>A drop in inflation and interest rates, a stable peseta, and a new, confident atmosphere have been the reward.</p>
<p>&quot;We have given a lesson on how to make changes and how to accept changes,&quot; crowed Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato at an appearance on Saturday to commemorate the election victory.</p>
<p>At a separate appearance, Industry Minister Josep Pique beat the government's drum even more loudly.</p>
<p>&quot;A year ago no one believed that we would be able to fulfil in such a clear fashion the conditions necessary to join the third phase of European Economic and Monetary Union from the start,&quot; Pique said.</p>
<p>Inflation fell to 2.9 percent in January, its lowest rate in 28 years and well beneath the 3.9 percent of a year earlier. Spain's key short-term interest rate has declined to a historic low of six percent, down from nine percent at the start of 1996.</p>
<p>The government has also pledged to reduce the deficit to three percent of gross domestic product in 1997, as required, from 4.4 percent in 1996 and 6.6 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Despite the improvement, not everything is rosy on the economic front.</p>
<p>According to the poll, the government's key challenges were labour reform, a reduction in expenditure and in unemployment and fiscal reform.</p>
<p>Labour and employer representatives are in talks to make Spain's rigid labour market more flexible.</p>
<p>Spain still sports western European's highest unemployment rate -- at 21.78 percent near double the European Union average.</p>
<p>On Saturday, vice president Francisco Alvarez Cascos pledged 200,000 net new jobs this year as well as a reduction in unemployment to two million from the current 2.26 million registered unemployed.</p>
