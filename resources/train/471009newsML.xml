<p>Two left-wing Indonesian strike leaders accused of subversion should be jailed for six and eight years, prosecutors were quoted as saying on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The prosecutors in Indonesia's second city of Surabaya sought the sentences on Coen Husein Pontoh, 27, and Dita Indah Sari, 30, for manipulating, undermining and deviating from state policy guidelines, the official Antara news agency reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two activists were the first of 12 members of groups under the small-left wing People's Democratic Party (PRD) being tried using Indonesia's controversial subversion law. Subversion carries a maximum penalty of death,</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the two activists, who organised a major strike in Surabaya in early July 1996 involving up to 20,000 workers, also disturbed national unity and stability as well as productivity and the receipt of foreign exchange income.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been proven to have acted against the subversion law,&quot; the prosecutors were quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Antara quoted Pontoh, from the unrecognised Indonesian Farmers Union, as saying he would continue to struggle for workers' rights.</p>
<p>Sari, leader of the PRD's labour wing, the Indonesian Workers Struggle Centre, said she would respond later in court. Both earlier denied the charges.</p>
<p>Most of the PRD's leaders, including chairman Budiman Sudjatmiko, were arrested and charged with subversion after riots in Jakarta on July 27 last year which the government and military initially blamed on the group.</p>
<p>However, when their court cases started to be heard last December there was no mention of the riots and the government accused the PRD of undermining the state ideology Pancasila and spreading hatred against the government.</p>
