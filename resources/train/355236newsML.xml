<p>Controversial rapper Tupac Shakur was trying to break with drugs and violence and settle down to a new life with fiancee Kidada Jones, daughter of producer Quincy Jones, before his murder five months ago, Vanity Fair magazine reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The magazine said Shakur &quot;was exhausted playing the gangster role&quot; and also wanted to break with his record company, Death Row, for whom he had sold more than $60 million in records but which said he owed it $4.9 million.</p>
<p>Shakur, who was gunned down by an unknown assailant in Las Vegas while in the car of Death Row records chief Marion &quot;Suge&quot; Knight, had plans to finance a youth centre for at-risk teenagers and was setting up a special phone number where children in trouble could call him, the magazine said.</p>
<p>In a separate interview with ABC's &quot;PrimeTime Live&quot; to be shown on Wednesday, Shakur's mother Afeni said she was convinced that Las Vegas police do not want to solve her son's murder and that he was afraid in the weeks before his death that he was being cheated.</p>
<p>After his death, she said she discovered that much of what she thought he owned was not his and that the master recordings of 250 unreleased songs were missing.</p>
