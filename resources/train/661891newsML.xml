<p>German political leaders said on Saturday they were confident France would support an undiluted stability pact ensuring fiscal discipline for Europe's single currency at the Amsterdam summit on Monday.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Finance Minister Theo Waigel predicted France's newly elected Socialist government would retreat from demands before the European Union summit to attach jobs-creation programmes to the stability pact.</p>
<p>EU countries hoped to ratify the stability pact at the summit in Amsterdam. But France's new Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin upset the plans by demanding last week that the 18 million jobless in the EU be taken into account.</p>
<p>&quot;The new government in Paris is committed to Europe's course of integration and to the stability pact,&quot; Kinkel said in an interview in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. &quot;France and Germany will clearly be pulling together on the same rope in Amsterdam.&quot;</p>
<p>Karl Lamers, the foreign policy spokesman in parliament for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats also predicted that Germany and France would settle their differences over Europe's single currency before the Amsterdam summit began on Monday.</p>
<p>But Lamers said Germany remained opposed to costly job- creation programmes such as France has proposed because they ultimately fail to cut unemployment. He said Bonn was convinced the way to fight joblessness was through structural reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;We are convinced that programmes that raise expenditure are not sensible,&quot; Lamers told German Radio. &quot;We have tried that in the past and it didn't work...Where is the added money going to come from without going further into debt?&quot;</p>
<p>Lamers said in the past spending programmes only ended up raising inflation and interest rates, which was ultimately counterproductive to efforts to reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;I am certain that we will find common ground,&quot; Lamers said. &quot;It has been proven through countries that have successfully fought unemployment like the Netherlands that the only way to lower unemployment is with structural reforms.&quot;</p>
<p>Lamers said French and German officials were working intensively through the weekend to bridge the differences.</p>
<p>Kohl met French President Jacques Chirac and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in Poitiers, France, on Friday in an unsuccessful bid to reach agreement on the proposed jobs pact for European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Jospin said his government was committed to EMU but wanted a fundamentally new approach to monetary union.</p>
<p>France's demands for a focus on growth and jobs must be given the same importance as the stability pact limiting budget deficits after the launch of a single currency, he said.</p>
<p>France's new government, swept to power in elections two weeks ago, raised its objections to the German-inspired stability pact at an international meeting for the first time on Monday.</p>
<p>Lamers said it was merely a question of time before the French government realised their jobs plans would not work.</p>
<p>Waigel, speaking on Hochstadt in southern Germany, said that Germany and France were not at odds over the need for the stability pact and hoped a weekend agreement could be reached.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of the stability pact has not been put into question by the new French government,&quot; Waigel said. &quot;Not a single comma, not a single period and not a single word will be changed. Everyone must know that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The question is whether we can reach agreement over the issue of employment and whether we can say more,&quot; Waigel said.</p>
<p>Waigel, architect of the stability pact approved last year in Dublin and due for approval at the Amsterdam summit, said Bonn was committed to fighting unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;The mark is more than just a currency,&quot; he said. &quot;It is part of the identity of Germany, one struck even before we won our first Olympic gold medal or first world soccer championship. There is only one answer to win support - stability, stability and once more stability.&quot;</p>
