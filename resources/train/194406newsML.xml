<p>Toronto stocks surged to their 58th record close of the year on Friday as a bank-led rally overwhelmed a drop in gold prices.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index jumped 49.65 points to finish at 5870.56, easily eclipsing the previous closing record set on Thursday.</p>
<p>The key 300 Index also set an intraday high of 5880.15.</p>
<p>Trading was brisk with 118 million shares changing hands worth C$1.8 billion ($1.34 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;It was an option expiry day so obviously you had a lot of emotion that went into the market,&quot; said Ron Meisels, president of P and C Holdings Ltd. in Montreal.</p>
<p>The financial services group continued to rebound after correcting earlier this week. The sector added nearly 90 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 5388.</p>
<p>&quot;All the banks sold off due to profit taking in the last few days. Now, we're seeing a wave of buying, but it hasn't taken them to new highs,&quot; Meisels said.</p>
<p>Other strong groups included consumer products, communications, base metals and energy issues.</p>
<p>The weak side was led by transportation and precious metals which weakened along with sagging gold prices.</p>
