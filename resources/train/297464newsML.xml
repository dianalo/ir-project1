<headline>FOCUS - Bonn has EMU headache as GDP slows.</headline>

<p>Germany on Thursday reported record joblessness and a slowdown in economic growth, giving Bonn a throbbing headache at the start of a year which is crucial to its bid to forge European monetary union.</p>
<p>The Federal Statistics Office said Germany's budget deficit rose to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 from 3.5 percent in 1995, casting doubt on Bonn's pledge to reach the three percent ceiling set for nations seeking to merge their currencies into the Euro in 1999.</p>
<p>GDP growth in 1996 slowed to 1.4 percent last year according to provisional data, down from 1.9 percent in 1995, and the statistics office said the economy stagnated in the final quarter with virtually no growth from the third quarter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile German unemployment rose 48,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 4.156 million in December, a new post-war record that topped the prior level of 4.1 million in November, the Federal Labour Office said.</p>
<p>On an unadjusted basis, some 4.148 million were unemployed, below the peak of 4.27 million in February 1996. Federal Labour Office President Bernhard Jagoda said he could not rule out the unadjusted figure soon reaching 4.5 million.</p>
<p>The GDP rise was at the lower end of economists' expectations while the jobless data were in line.</p>
<p>The news fuelled speculation that German interest rates, on hold since late last August, may be trimmed again and helped push the dollar up to a two-year high against the mark.</p>
<p>But the Bundesbank, which has repeatedly said rates are already low enough for an economic upturn, kept its key interest rates unchanged at Thursday's regular council meeting.</p>
<p>Economists said the figures showed Germany trapped in a vicious circle of mounting unemployment and weak growth, a dangerous combination as it enters 1997, the year on whose data candidates for currency union will be judged.</p>
<p>Under the EU stability pact thrashed out at Germany's insistence to ensure a strong Euro, Bonn would now face a fine of 11 billion marks ($7 billion) for its deficit overshoot in 1996, said Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures show we have a structural problem here and (Finance Minister Theo) Waigel's pledge to push the deficit below three percent in 1997 does not seem very credible to me,&quot; said Fels, who expects a deficit of 3.3 to 3.4 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think monetary union will fail just because of an overshoot by a few decimal points but the overshoot will raise doubts about the credibility of the single currency.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the data, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he saw good chances for an economic upturn, in part because of low inflation and low interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no reason at all to talk negatively (about the economy),&quot; Kohl told a news conference in Bonn. &quot;The weak phase has been overcome...The chances for an upturn have a solid foundation.&quot;</p>
<p>The statistics office said economic growth in 1996 was driven by exports, capital investment and state spending, while consumer spending growth slowed to 1.4 percent from 1.8 percent and construction spending fell 2.7 percent.</p>
<p>The fall in construction investment hit east Germany particularly hard, causing GDP growth in the economically depressed region to slow sharply to 2.0 percent from 5.3 percent. West German GDP grew 1.3 percent, down from 1.6.</p>
<p>The statistics office warned that current growth was too slow to curb unemployment significantly. With companies laying off workers at the present pace, productivity growth at 2.5 percent was outstripping economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;From our point of view, that cannot have a positive impact on the labour market. We need real growth exceeding productivity growth, then we can expect the labour market to benefit,&quot; said statistics office president Johann Hahlen.</p>
<p>Economists have said the present cold weather gripping Germany could hamper construction so much that the economy might contract in the first quarter of 1997 -- as it did a year ago -- with little improvement likely before the spring.</p>
<p>Forecasts for 1997 growth range from 2.0 to about 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the 1.4 percent growth last year was in line with Bonn's projection of a 1.5 percent expansion and noted conditions were positive for a further improvement and stronger growth in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The world economic environment is developing positively, and the conditions for investment have improved,&quot; he said. Government budget consolidation will continue and employment will increase, he said.</p>
