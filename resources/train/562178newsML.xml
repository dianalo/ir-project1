<p>Estonia's commercial paper market has established itself as one of the preferred ways of getting domestic funds by corporate and municipal clients and market participants said the market was set to grow.</p>
<p>However, competition with Western sources of financing was becoming tougher, they added.</p>
<p>Some 500 million kroons of commercial paper has been issued and Ulo Kallas, interest product manager with Hansapank, said this would rise.</p>
<p>&quot;The commercial paper market will certainly grow further, because it is the best borrowing possibility in Estonian kroons,&quot; Kallas told Reuters.</p>
<p>The pace of issues has even been rivalling that of share issues, seen as the boom financial market in Estonia.</p>
<p>But Talinvest project leader Rain Nuka said many issuers are being made offers from Western banks to raise finance through syndicated loans, which were cheaper than CPs.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore I see a trend for fewer issuers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The most active companies so far have been the Tallinn Water and Sewage Company, Tallinn Heating, the Port of Tallinn, Hansa Liising, confectionary firm Kalev, Eesti Telefon (Estonian Telephone) and Eesti Mobiiltelefon (Estonian Mobiletelephone).</p>
<p>Kallas said commercial paper was popular because it had advantages over straight bank loans, including lower rates.</p>
<p>The average yield on commercial papers is 8.45 percent, compared to 11.39 percent on kroon loans.</p>
<p>&quot;The commercial paper issuer does not need guarantees, which is not the case with commercial loans,&quot; Kallas added.</p>
<p>Kallas said the share of foreign and local investor interest in the market was equal.</p>
<p>&quot;It means that many foreign investors are prepared to accept a currency devaluation risk for three months,&quot; Kallas said.</p>
<p>Although the kroon is pegged at eight to one German mark some foreigners are uncertain that the currency can be maintained at its eight kroon to one mark peg.</p>
<p>&quot;A fat spread has made investing into commercial papers attractive,&quot; Kallas added, noting that yields are around 400 basis points above mark Libor.</p>
<p>But Talinvest and Uhispank said investors were mostly local.</p>
<p>&quot;But it can be noticed, that more Western institutions are taking short-term positions in Estonian kroons,&quot; Nuka said.</p>
<p>Nuka said foreign investors do not want to take positions over one year as that is too long, given the currency risk.</p>
<p>Andres Rajamaa, manager of money markets for Uhispank, said investors were mostly Estonian companies but that there has also been interest from international investors, especially from Scandinavia and Finland, he added.</p>
