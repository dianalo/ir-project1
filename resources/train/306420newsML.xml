<p>Fresh Choice Inc, owner of a chain of 48 restaurants, on Tuesday said fourth quarter earnings will not meet previous company forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;Fresh Choice's results for 1996 will be above the previous year, and we're moving toward profitability. But our fourth quarter results will not reach earlier expectations,&quot; Charles Lynch, chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it has named David Pertl as its new chief financial officer, replacing David Anderson who will be leaving the company.  </p>
<p>Pertl was chief financial officer of Summit Family Restaurants Inc, based in Salt Lake City, from 1989 to July 1996, and prior to that he was controller and chief financial officer of Ponderosa Inc.</p>
<p>Lynch said he is impressed with Pertl's operating philosophy, including close relationships with restaurant managers. &quot;He's a results-oriented guy,&quot; Lynch said.</p>
<p>To help boost sales in 1997, the company plans to launch a &quot;major television advertising program&quot; and aggressive marketing plans as early as this month.</p>
<p>The consensus estimate for Fresh Choice's fourth quarter was a loss of $0.17 a share, according to investment research firm First Call.</p>
<p>Fresh Choice shares were off 7/8 at 3-3/4 by mid-morning.</p>
