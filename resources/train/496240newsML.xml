<p>Police found arms and ammunitions including anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in Burundi's capital Bujumbura on Wednesday and arrested four people, the army said.</p>
<p>Army Spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi said the arms were found hidden in Buyenzi district in Bujumbura and thanked the public for a tip-off. He said police were investigating.</p>
<p>&quot;The information at our disposal is incomplete. Burundi has many criminals and ethnic groups. But if the conclusions of our investigation implicate ex-president (Jean Baptiste) Bagaza, we will tell you,&quot; Nibizi told reporters.</p>
<p>Authorities said last month they had arrested eight people including five members of the Parena party, led by Bagaza, who were plotting to kill military ruler Pierre Buyoya.</p>
<p>Bujumbura has been rocked by a series of mine blasts since March in a campaign by opponents of Buyoya. The explosions killed 15 people and wounded 12.</p>
<p>Burundi's Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama however said mine blasts might continue until all the &quot;criminals&quot; were caught.</p>
<p>Meanwhile wounded soldiers at the military hospital in Bujumbura said on Wednesday fighting was continuing in the southern province of Makamba near the border with Tanzania.</p>
<p>They said fighting started last Thursday when a group of Hutu rebels entered from Tanzania and killed two civilians.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people have been killed in massacres and fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army and rebels since the killing of Burundi's first elected Hutu president in October 1993.</p>
<p>Regional states, which imposed sanctions shortly after last July's coup to pressure Buyoya into peace talks with the rebels, plan a summit in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha next Wednesday.</p>
