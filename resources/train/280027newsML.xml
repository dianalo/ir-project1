<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wayne Gretzky of the New York Rangers will make his first-ever start for the Eastern Conference in the 1997 NHL All-Star game.</p>
<p>Gretzky headed the list of six starters named to the Eastern Conference team for the January 18 game in San Jose, California in the final fan balloting released on Monday.</p>
<p>The veteran centre had been voted to all but one of nine Western Conference starting lineups since fan balloting began in 1986 and will be playing in his 16th All-Star game.</p>
<p>Gretzky will be flanked by wingers Jaromir Jagr of the Pittsburgh Penguins, named to a starting position for the fifth consecutive time, and Dino Ciccarelli of the Tampa Bay Lightning, who will make his first All-Star game start.</p>
<p>Gretzky's teammate, Brian Leetch, is one of the starting defencemen along with Ray Bourque of the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>John Vanbiesbrouck of the Florida Panthers led all vote-getters with 334,919 and will make his first career All-Star start in goal.</p>
<p>Gretzky -- in his first season in the Eastern Conference after playing in Edmonton, Los Angeles and St. Louis -- led all centres with 196,603 votes. Rangers teammate Mark Messier was second in the voting at centre with 164,77 votes.</p>
<p>Jagr, who led all wingers with 302,212 votes, currently has 56 points, including a league-high 33 goals. Jagr and teammate Mario Lemieux share the NHL lead with 56 points, four more than Gretzky, who leads the NHL with 38 assists.</p>
<p>Ciccarelli, who has 33 goals and 56 assists, finished with 182,514 votes to earn the starting berth ahead of John LeClair of Philadelphia (169,262).</p>
<p>Bourque had 285,624 votes and was named to his 15th All-Star squad. He became the only player to have received an All-Star game starting berth in all 10 years of fan balloting. Leetch had 284,504 votes, ahead of Ed Jovanovski of Florida (250,075).</p>
<p>Leetch has nine goals and 31 assists and Bourque has two goals and 12 assists.</p>
<p>Vanbiesbrouck, who easily won the balloting at goal ahead of Martin Brodeur of New Jersey (167,805), is 12-6-6 with a 2.15 goals against average.</p>
<p>The Western Conference starters were released last week. The reserves for both teams will be announced later this week.</p>
