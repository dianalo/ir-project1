<p>Jury selection was set to begin  Friday morning in Florida's billion-dollar lawsuit seeking to force  tobacco companies to pay the cost of treating sick smokers.</p>
<p>The case is the first of the state's so-called &quot;Medicaid suits&quot; against  the industry to make it to trial.</p>
<p>Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles and Attorney General Bob Butterworth both  attended the opening session.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time the American public is going to find out the  full truth about what the tobacco companies have been doing, what  they've been hiding for the past 40 years,&quot; Butterworth said on the  steps of the Palm Beach County Courthouse.</p>
<p>Some 300 jurors were assembled from which attorneys will select a  panel of six jurors and nine alternates to hear the state's 1995 lawsuit  against major cigarette makers.</p>
<p>In the suit, Florida aims to force the tobacco industry to repay the  costs for Medicaid treatment of thousands of Floridians allegedly  harmed by tobacco smoke.  </p>
<p>As the first of 40 similar state lawsuits brought against the industry  to go to trial, the case is being carefully watched by legal scholars  and financial markets.</p>
<p>But with a $368.5 billion global settlement under discussion in Washington,  there is a chance that the lawsuit will not be resolved in court.  Congress may approve the global pact, rendering the lawsuit moot,  or Florida could settle, as did Mississippi.</p>
<p>Like many past lawsuits against the industry, Florida's lawsuit claims  tobacco companies made a dangerous and defective product and misled  the public about its risks.</p>
<p>But the lawsuit differs dramatically in one respect. Where past actions  were brought by smokers or family members who said they were directly  hurt by cigarettes, Florida is a third party, unaffected by smoke  and seeking only to recover costs.</p>
