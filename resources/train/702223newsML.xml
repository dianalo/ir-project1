<headline>NYS may set new record set for late budgets -- Gov.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>New York State last year set a national record for late budgets, and looks likely to surpass that performance this year, as Gov. George Pataki said Wednesday he did expect a pact would be agreed to anytime soon.</p>
<p>The governor, who last year held up a budget until July 13 -- over three months past its April 1 deadline -- to get the legislature to agree to overhaul the workers' compensation system, says the latest battle is over welfare.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is saying can you make July 13. I have two answers to that. One is that I don't think we can. But two, what's more important now is to make sure that we take this opportunity to the fullest and change that welfare system to build on the successes,&quot; Pataki told reporters in Albany, after meeting with the leaders of the Senate and the Assembly.</p>
<p>The governor proposed a one-week, $1.81 billion appropriations bill that would fund the government from July 5 through July 11. He stressed the importance of continuing to modify the state's welfare system, arguing that his Administration deserved the credit for a 350,000-drop in welfare recipients over the past two-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>Pataki's Democratic opponent, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represents Manhattan, sees a host of other issues that must be resolved to get a budget, including health care, education and higher education. The Assembly, which forecasts bigger revenues than the Pataki Administration, has fought the governor's plans to cut these areas.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we made substantial progress towards restorations in those areas, that has to be the key and the foundation of any budget,&quot; Silver said.</p>
<p>The Senate Majority Leader, Joseph Bruno, R-Troy, focussed strongly on property tax cuts, a reduction in the gross receipts tax, a higher education program, and criminal justice reform, in addition to welfare. &quot;Not one issue can stand by itself, and that's why this process is so difficult,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pataki, who wants to replace the state's Home Relief program for single, childless adults with a voucher, safety-net system, said he would accept a program with a &quot;small personal needs allowance.&quot; Such cash allowances appeared to be directed at people in nursing and adult homes.</p>
<p>The Republican governor, who has cast himself as leader who brings different parties together, appeared to leave himself ample negotiating room. When asked if Home Relief benefits at some point would finally be shut, he responded: &quot;As I said, all along, I never say it has to be my way.&quot;</p>
<p>While Pataki wanted to end Home Relief benefits at once, he now says he wants the Assembly, which wishes to keep the aid for two years, to agree to a phase-out, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The governor's voucher plan was attacked by localities because it would impose administrative burdens, and he declined to say whether this would be an option for cities and towns. Pataki did not foresee problems in paying welfare workers, who now must meet workfare requirements imposed by new federal rules, less than the minimum wage, though a state judge in Manhattan has said New York City must do so.</p>
<p>The Assembly Speaker, who submitted a rival welfare plan, outlined a new one that he said would save $225 million. The program would require Home Relief recipients to work and penalize local social service districts up to five percent of their administrative costs if they failed to assign all &quot;employable&quot; recipients to workfare.</p>
<p>The plan also would limit benefits for new state residents, in an effort to stop needy individuals from moving to the state, toughen disqualification penalties, and increase training. Silver also wants to use part of the state's $2.4 billion block grant to temporarily pay the wages of welfare recipients hired by private employers.</p>
