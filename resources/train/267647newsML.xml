<p>India's opposition Hindu nationalists demanded on Thursday that Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda resign after a court ordered the lifting of federal rule in India's most populous state.</p>
<p>In a judgment delivered in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh state, the Allahabad High Court upheld an appeal by leaders of the main opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against federal rule, court officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have won in court and we want justice,&quot; BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee was quoted by the Press Trust of India (PTI) as saying. &quot;We demand the resignation of the United Front government as it has murdered democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma, bowing to a decision by Deve Gowda's cabinet, in October imposed direct rule on the northern state after local elections resulted in a hung assembly and efforts to form a government failed.</p>
<p>The BJP, which emerged from the polls as the largest single party in the state legislature, had appealed to the court, arguing that it had been denied a chance to form a government.</p>
<p>The court gave the federal government until December 25 to challenge the order. If no appeal is lodged, efforts to form a state government would be renewed.</p>
<p>But the federal government held back on any move to immediately challenge the order in India's Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Home (interior) Minister Indrajit Gupta said the government's intention was always to form a popular government, which could not happen earlier because no party was in a position to form a stable government.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me...assure the house once again that the government firmly believes that a popular government should indeed be installed in the state but in this effort we require the cooperation of all political parties to break the stalemate in the state,&quot; Gupta told parliament.</p>
<p>The BJP won 177 seats in the 425-member assembly, followed by Deve Gowda's United Front coalition with 134 seats. The lower-caste Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) won 67 seats and its ally, the Congress party, took 33 seats.</p>
<p>The assembly was suspended but not dissolved after the imposition of federal rule in the politically crucial state, which sends 85 lawmakers to the 545-member federal parliament, more than any other of India's 26 states.</p>
<p>The decision to impose federal rule over Uttar Pradesh, which has 140 million people, provoked an uproar from the BJP, which had expected an invitation to form a government.</p>
<p>The BJP briefly held power in the state beginning in 1991. But New Delhi dismissed its government after Hindu zealots demolished a 16th-century mosque in the Uttar Pradesh town of Ayodhya in December 1992.</p>
