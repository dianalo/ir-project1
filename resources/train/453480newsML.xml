<p>Algeria's current account balance of payments posted a surplus of $1.7 billion at the end of 1996, the government said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It said the figure was achieved due to trade balance surplus of more than $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>The country's foreign exchange reserves stood at $4.23 billion in 1996 compared to $2.11 billion in 1995, said the statement issued following a cabinet meeting in Algiers.</p>
<p>&quot;The positive results in the current account balance and the foreign reserves level reached in 1996, which confirmed their improvement early in 1997, proved definitely that the country has avoided the risk of a third foreign debt rescheduling,&quot; said the statement carried by the official Algerian news agency APS.</p>
<p>The North African country struck with its foreign government debtors two successive debt reschedulings in 1994 and 1995. The rescheduling involved about $12 billion of its foreign debt estimated at nearly $32 billion.</p>
<p>The statement said the violence-stricken country's economy maintained an upward trend and that Algeria gross domestic product (GDP) was steady at about 4.0 percent in 1996, the same rate as the year before.</p>
<p>The inflation rate was 18.7 percent in 1996 against 29.8 percent in 1995, said the government, adding that inflation would decrease more in 1997.</p>
<p>The economy's healthy performance was reflected in 190,000 new jobs created in 1996, it said. Algeria's unemployement was about 28 percent in 1995 hitting more than 2 million people among a workforce of more than 5.0 million.</p>
<p>The government gave no comparative figure for the 1996, $1.7 billion current account surplus saying only that the current account deficit in 1995 amounted to 5.9 percent of the Algerian GDP.</p>
<p>President Liamine Zeroual's government has been in conflict for the past five years with Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas who took up weapons in early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead.</p>
<p>Zeroual announced a parliamentary election on June 5 promising the nation's 29 million people the poll will help pull the country out of violence in which about 60,000 people have died in the past five years.</p>
