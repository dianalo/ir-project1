<p>A Kuwait parliament panel on Sunday approved a 4.689 billion dinar ($15.42 billion) state budget for 1997/98, with a gross deficit of 1.584 billion dinars.</p>
<p>The Financial and Economic Affairs Committee put total revenues at 3.105 billion dinars. By law, 10 percent of total revenues is placed in an overseas investment account, making the net deficit 1.274 billion dinars.</p>
<p>The 4.21 billion dinar 1996/97 budget carried a projected net deficit of 1.21 billion dinars and a gross deficit of 1.51 billion which was considerably cut due to a rise in oil prices in 1996 by some $5 a barrel higher than a projected $13.5, officials and economists said.</p>
<p>Oil-rich Kuwait's full parliament will meet on Monday and Tuesday to approve the state and other pending budgets for various government institutions ahead of a summer recess.</p>
<p>The committee said it approved the state budget for the fiscal year starting July 1, 1997 after the government agreed to cut non-oil revenues, raising the total deficit.</p>
<p>The committee had in May rejected the budget proposal for assuming a rise in non-oil revenues of 203 million dinars from higher rates for some public services -- a measure which requires prior approval by the welfare state's parliament.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Nasser al-Rodhan later agreed to cut the proposed revenue figure by 92 million dinars.</p>
<p>Officials earlier told Reuters Kuwait's oil revenue was again calculated in the new budget at a conservative barrel price of $13.5 on a daily output of two million barrels per day -- in line with the country's OPEC quota.</p>
<p>The original budget proposed by the government had expenditure at 4.37 billion dinars and a net deficit of 1.17 billion. Oil revenue, almost unchanged from the previous year, was forecast at 2.56 billion dinars.</p>
<p>Slightly more than half of the tiny state's oil earnings will be spent in 1997/98 on salaries.</p>
<p>The finance committee said in a statement it discussed defence spending and a plan to rebuild the Kuwaiti military which was devastated by Iraq's 1990 invasion. It gave no figures. It said the committee also studied the planned purchase of surface-to-surface naval missiles and 155mm howitzer guns.</p>
<p>Experts say the deals are worth about $150 million and $200 million respectively.</p>
<p>After the 1991 Gulf War, Kuwait launched a $12 billion plan to 2004 to rearm its military but experts say deals have been facing long delays with the government trying to respond to repeated questioning by MPs prior to concluding any contracts.</p>
