<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's FTSE 100 leading share index finished moderately higher, bolstered by strength in the large multinational companies that benefited from a vicious sell-off in sterling, traders and analysts said. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,862.6, up 11.1 points or 0.23 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Share prices climbed in late session trading, extending the strong gains put on during the bourse session as investors continued to direct funds towards Germany. The DAX-30 index closed at 4,371.16, up 53.52 points or 1.24 percent. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,400.30, up 31.76 points or 0.73 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - Shares closed lower, unable to hold late-afternoon gains made on the back of Wall Street's strength, traders said. The CAC-40 index closed at 3,022.20, down 3.74 points or 0.12 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares ended higher, boosted by late European buying after Wall Street shares staged gains in early U.S. trade. The Swiss market index closed at 5,888.0, up 41.0 points or 0.70 percent.</p>
<p>MILAN - Shares eased back to end lower as sellers emerged in late afternoon to give the market a negative stance after stocks on the Milan bourse spent much of the trading day in positive territory, dealers said. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 14,973, down 121 points or 0.80 percent.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Shares closed at a record high, with a surge in cyclical stocks ahead of results this week livening up an otherwise lacklustre market. The AEX index closed at 992.89, up 3.86 points or 0.39 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks ended higher as the yen's slump against the dollar spurred buying in major export-oriented issues such as electronics and cars, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 20,575.26, up 185.72 points or 0.91 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks inched to a slightly higher close, with a record-breaking performance by Hutchison Whampoa offset by profit-taking in HSBC Holdings, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 15,666.59, up 8.47 points or 0.05 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The share market ended 1.2 percent higher on continuing anticipation of an official interest rate cut, and dealers say the bullish sentiment may see the market surge to record highs. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,723.8, up 32.6 points or 1.21 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Industrial shares finished at record highs as players anticipated that positive money supply and private-sector credit figures would point to a reduction in the country's high interest rates. The All-share index closed at 7,490.8, up 46.8 points or 0.63 percent. The All Gold index closed at 990.8, up 21.0 points or 0.79 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 9,125.9, up 71.5 points or 2.17 percent.</p>
