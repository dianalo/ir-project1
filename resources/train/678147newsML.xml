<p>Despite being forced indoors by rain, Britain's Greg Rusedski did his pre-Wimbledon confidence no harm by winning the Nottingham Open on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Canadian-born Rusedski powered to an impressive 6-4 7-5 final victory over Karol Kucera and made it clear he was fed up with living in the shadow of British number one Tim Henman.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I'll get a headline now,&quot; commented Rusedski after landing his fourth ATP title. &quot;Even at Queen's it was What's wrong with Tim?' and not Rusedski's doing well'. The only way to do something about it, I guess, is to keep winning.</p>
<p>Torrential rain forced organisers to take the semi-finals and final of the grass-court tournament indoors for the second day in succession. As a consequence, 3,000 fans were again locked outside due to a lack of spectator access and safety reasons.</p>
<p>Another 100 watched from under umbrellas through the windows of the Nottingham Tennis Centre as Rusedski despatched Aussie Sandon Stolle 6-3 6-4 in the first semifinal.</p>
<p>Kucera then beat Henman 6-4 2-6 6-4 to rule out the unprecedented sight of two Britons contesting an ATP final.</p>
