<headline>Iraq demand behind Amman stocks healthy 1997 start.</headline>
<dateline>AMMAN 1997-01-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Jordan's bourse was dragged down on its first 1997 trading day on Saturday by sell-offs in larger heavily-capitalised blue chips, triggered by start-of-year price corrections, dealers said.</p>
<p>However this was partially offset by the brighter performance of industrials that stand to benefit from exports to Iraq, which helped give the market a good start to the New Year with a healthy turnover of 995,263 dinars ($1.4 million).</p>
<p>The official Amman Financial Market 60-share index fell 1.21 percent to 151.61 points, attributed by dealers to falls in three large capitalised firms close to the five percent daily ceiling.</p>
<p>They are Arab Bank, Jordan Cement Factories and Jordan Phosphate Mines -- all heavily weighted in the official index based on market capitalisation.</p>
<p>Demand focussed mostly on drug, vegetable oils and detergent firms which have won export orders under Iraq's U.N. approved &quot;oil-for food&quot; deal, which should benefit 1997 half-year results, dealers said.</p>
<p>Investors' hopes of business opportunities in Iraq that could breathe new life into the Amman bourse were raised after recent orders exceeding $100 million were secured by leading Jordanian firms under the UN deal.</p>
<p>But the healthy activity was offset by price corrections in larger capitalised blue chips, whose closing levels had been artificially bolstered by stepped-up portfolio buying in the last week of 1996.</p>
<p>Portolios and institutions were inducing limited buying in selected shares to prop up closing prices to help reduce loss provisions for 1996 price falls that averaged around 12 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The start of 1997 witnessed a maximum drop in prices of these blue-chip shares that had been pushed up in the last day of 1996 trade in window dresssing deals for the sake of revaluation of portfolios and funds,&quot; said Nasser al-Amad, head of the brokerage firm United Financial Investments.</p>
<p>Among the busiest stocks were Unified Transport Company Jordan Petroleum Refinery and Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing -- all companies whose 1997 performance hinges on exports or links to Iraq.</p>
<p>They rose 0.10 dinar to 2.12 dinars, 0.03 dinar to 9.58 dinars and 0.12 dinar to 3.62 dinars respectively.</p>
<p>Arab Pharamaceutical Chemicals, a leading drug firm with substantial sales to Iraq, rose 5.26 percent to 1.40 dinars, in the day's highest rise in the bourse on Saturday.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Investable Index of the 45 best performing shares on the exchange shed 0.61 percent to 82.88 points from 83.39 points.</p>
<p>Rising shares outnumbered losers on Saturday by 29 to 16, with shares in four other firms trading but closing unchanged.</p>
