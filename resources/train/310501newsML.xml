<p>Hyundai shipyard workers smashed through picket lines at South Korea's biggest dockyard on Wednesday in defiance of a nationwide strike threatened as the biggest in history, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Several hundred militant unionists blocking the iron gates of the giant facility tossed buckets of yellow paint at workers clad in blue overalls as they surged through.</p>
<p>Blows were exchanged, but there were no serious injuries.</p>
<p>The yard, one of the engines of South Korea's export-led economy and part of the Hyundai Group, is situated in the southeast city of Ulsan, traditionally a hotbed of union militancy.</p>
<p>Its cranes, dry-docks and welding plants were operating normally.</p>
<p>In the capital Seoul, a Labour Ministry official said essential services had not been affected by a nationwide strike call by two trade unions in protest at a controversial labour law that has sparked three weeks of wildcat stoppages.</p>
<p>The unions had urged the biggest strike ever in South Korea on Tuesday and Wednesday, although it was clear most workers ignored the call. Buses and subways were running normally.</p>
<p>Strikes were intended to cap three weeks of wildcat stoppages sparked by the forced passage of a labour law on December 26 that has broken a tradition of jobs-for-life by permitting layoffs.</p>
<p>However, in a sign that industrial action was rattling long-term confidence in the economy, demand for dollars on the interbank market sent the Korean won tumbling to its lowest levels in six years.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected strikes would hit exports and exacerbate an already worrying trade deficit.</p>
<p>The central bank has been pumping dollars into the market to try to brake the won's descent, traders said.</p>
<p>Stock market investors remained relieved that the strikes were fizzling and sent share prices jumping on Wednesday for the second straight day.</p>
<p>&quot;Korea telecom, the postal service and the nation's railroad services have not been influenced by the strike,&quot; the labour ministry official said.</p>
<p>Television pictures showed commuters clambering on to buses, and subway trains pulling smoothly into stations even though 2,000 underground rail workers were on strike.</p>
<p>Operators of the Seoul subway have said non-union drivers could keep the system operating for two weeks</p>
<p>The government of President Kim Young-sam argues that flexible labour practices will cut corporate costs and improve international competitiveness as exports sag.</p>
<p>The Federation of Korean Trade Unions had called for a two-day &quot;all-out&quot; strike starting on Tuesday and the rival Korean Confederation of Trade Unions had ordered public sector workers under its control to stop work from Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Labour Ministry said that at 7 a.m. (2200 GMT Tuesday) only three of Seoul's 88 bus companies had observed the strike call. It said bus firms in the rest of the country had completely disregarded the strike call.</p>
<p>About a quarter of the nation's taxis were sitting idle in parking lots. Cab drivers have been the most enthusiastic supporters of the industrial action.</p>
