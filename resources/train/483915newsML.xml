<headline>UK investors in late PEP rush as election looms.</headline>

<p>Britain's investment industry has seen a late surge in applications for personal equity plans (PEPs) ahead of the April 5 deadline despite political uncertainty in the run-up to the election on May 1.</p>
<p>Industry players told Reuters that after a slow start to 1997 in January and February, sales had picked up considerably in March and total sales for the year would come in well ahead of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole industry seems to have gone ballistic,&quot; said Schroders assistant director Bridget Cleverly. She said the rush had come later this year, but sales in March for Schroders of 74 million stg were more than double the 33.6 million recorded in March 1996.</p>
<p>She said the key factors in the late run were likely to have been the rash of advertising campaigns by Pep providers, and tax uncertainty ahead of the election.</p>
<p>The industry has previously blamed concern about an overvalued stockmarket for sluggish PEP sales earlier in 1997, and Cleverly said it was unlikely that perceptions of the market would have changed much in March.</p>
<p>Labour said on Thursday it would extend the principle of tax-exempt savings schemes, which include PEPs.</p>
<p>The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds said the industry had been seeing improved sales in March but it was too early to give an exact figure.</p>
<p>But a spokeswoman said PEP sales of 4.3 billion stg in the year to April 5, 1996 had almost been matched by the end of February this year, with the traditionally busy year-end figures still to be added.</p>
<p>In a bumper March and the first five days of April last year sales of over 1.3 billion stg were recorded, she said, and this would have to be repeated if a 1994/5 record of 5.63 billion was to be threatened.</p>
<p>PEP sales in February were five percent down on February 1996, prompting speculation that high-cost advertising campaigns had failed to lure fresh interest from investors despite concerns that Labour would alter the tax status of PEPs.</p>
<p>But Independent Financial Adviser Promotion said a survey among its 14,000 members had shown a sharp rise in business in the period following the calling of the election in mid-March. An average increase in general business of 26 percent was reported.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever wins the general election, it seems that the public is anticipating higher taxes and interest rates. In addition, investor sentiment seems to have turned against UK equities,&quot; IFA Promotion's chief executive, Robert Browne-Clayton, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Interestingly, while the main political parties are dithering about Europe, investors appear convinced.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the five top sectors among investors were Europe, UK gilts and fixed interest, Far East excluding Japan, emerging markets and cash.</p>
<p>The top five products in the last two weeks were PEPs, personal pensions, fixed rate mortgages, national savings and venture capital trusts/enterprise investment schemes.</p>
