<p>Slovakia, in a bid to curb its burgeoning trade deficit, expects to sign a free-trade agreement with Russia by the end of next year, Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to complete the final text of the treaty by the end of June next year, so that it can be signed at a meeting of prime ministers later in 1997,&quot; Kozlik told a news conference after three days of talks between Russian and Slovak officials in Bratislava.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a big issue which we have to observe from a wider context and not only from an economic point of view,&quot; said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Babichev, who led the Russian side at the negotiations.</p>
<p>Neither official would comment on the pace, or extent to which trade will be liberalised.</p>
<p>&quot;So far only a basic framework agreement has been agreed upon, and now experts from both countries will work out concrete details of the treaty,&quot; Kozlik said.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of this year Slovakia's trade deficit with Moscow totalled 35.4 billion slovak crown ($1.15 billion). The entire Slovak trade gap totalled 37.17 billion crowns over the same period.</p>
<p>Kozlik said the two countries also reached an agreement on cooperation between their central banks, which should help facilitate financial transactions related to mutual trade.</p>
<p>Slovakia and Russia also signed several cooperation agreements.</p>
<p>Russia is Slovakia's sole crude oil and natural gas supplier and major raw materials source.</p>
<p>Kozlik also urged Slovak commercial banks to participate more actively in financing trade with Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;Our largest banks, such VUB bank for example, should open branches in Russia and create joint banking institutions with Russian banks to help solve payment problems for our mutual trade,&quot; Kozlik said, without elaborating further. ($1=30.79 Slovak Crown)</p>
