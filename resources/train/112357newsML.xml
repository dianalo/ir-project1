<p>Boris Becker overcame another hurdle in pursuit of his first title since injuring his wrist at Wimbledon when he beat American Todd Martin 3-6 6-4 6-2 in the semifinal of the $800,000 CA Trophy on Saturday.</p>
<p>In Sundady's final on the indoor hardcourt at Vienna's Stadthalle, fifth-seeded Becker will meet Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, who knocked out Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch 7-6 6-4.</p>
<p>Becker is playing his third tournament since injuring his right wrist in the third round at Wimbledon.</p>
<p>The world number seven and Australian Open champion returned to the circuit last month but recurring wrist troubles forced him to retire in the first round at Bucharest, then he lost in the second at Basel and pulled out of Lyon last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I am less afraid of my wrist with every match I play and win, meaning I can play more instinctively and improve my game. I just hope I can win one more match here,&quot; Becker said.</p>
<p>&quot;But tommorrow against Siemerink I have to be more concentrated. He leads the head-to-head by 2-1,&quot; said Becker, who will contest his 72nd singles career final on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am really surprised I made the final here, especially because the field was so strong,&quot; he added. Six top 10 players were involved in the tournament.</p>
<p>Becker, a three times Wimbledon champion, lost the opening set by dropping serve in the seventh game to go 3-5 down. He was then unable to convert a break chance and seventh-seeded Martin went on to take the set with a thundering ace.</p>
<p>But the 28-year-old German kept his calm to reverse matters and profit from a backhand volley from the American which went wide to break and clinch the second set 6-4.</p>
<p>Despite dropping his serve once in the deciding set, Becker broke his opponent three times, the last to complete victory after an hour and 52 minutes.</p>
<p>Siemerink, ranked 36th in the world, will contest his second final here after losing to Germany's Michael Stich in straight sets in 1991. He has made seven appearances in Vienna and reached the quarter-finals five times.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no idea why I always play so well here,&quot; he said. &quot;When I make my schedule I always try to stick with tournaments where I know I always do well.&quot;</p>
<p>Siemerink had a slow start in the match, failing to convert five break points and needing his seventh set point to clinch the first set.</p>
