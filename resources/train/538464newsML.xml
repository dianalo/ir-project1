<p>Base metal markets ended a less-active Friday LME session generally steadier, with copper and aluminium showing strong gains at the end of the kerb.</p>
<p>Traders said the markets absorbed the expected booksquaring ahead of the weekend, with copper in particular bracing itself for the fiercely tight nearby prompts that fall due from next Monday.</p>
<p>Conditions picked up towards the close, when shortcovering was seen in most metals, and apart from a depressed lead market, prices concluded around their peaks.</p>
<p>In copper, the cash/threes spread was around $200/210, near its highs of the week with the tightness likely to be maintained next week and cash/one day rates seen flaring.</p>
<p>The forward market dipped back to $2,365 at one stage, but subsequently raced up to close at $2,383, up $15 a tonne, signalling another challenge of $2,400.</p>
<p>The labour disputes at Escondida, Quebrada Branca and Phelps Dodge, as well as the maintainance shutdown of Kennecott's smelter remained the fundamental props.</p>
<p>Aluminium performed strongly, and looks to have built a base above $1,600. Borrowing of early July to the July date helped the trend also, and pulled cash/threes into $25/27 contango.</p>
<p>Last three months business was at $1,613, up $19 from Thursday's close. Alloy was marked up and ended at $1,490/95 a tonne.</p>
<p>Solid fundamentals helped zinc, with last business at $1,275, up $4, while tin and nickel followed the trend, closing at $5,740 and $7,480, respective gains of $20 and $30.</p>
<p>However, sluggish physicals and rising stocks inhibited lead, which closed at $631, down $4.</p>
