<title>SOUTH KOREA: S.Korean won ends higher on BOK intervention.</title>
<headline>S.Korean won ends higher on BOK intervention.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-02-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Intervention by the central Bank of Korea (BOK) in forward trading pushed the won to close higher on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>But they forecast consolidation would be short-lived in the local market, given the dollar's bullishness in world markets.</p>
<p>The won closed at 869.30 after opening at 869.90. The won rose to 867.60 after the intervention.</p>
<p>&quot;It's true the intervention made dollar buying interest weak today. But many doubt its long-term effect,&quot; said a domestic bank dealer.  </p>
<p>&quot;Without central bank intervention, the greenback would have climbed over the 870.00 won level today,&quot; said a foreign bank dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said BOK sold more than $200 million today, selling mostly in six-month forward trading.</p>
<p>They described the intervention as &quot;absurd&quot; because the dollar's persistent strength against other currencies including the yen and the mark rendered the bank's efforts useless.</p>
<p>&quot;The won/dollar rate will soon fluctuate in line with movement in the world market,&quot; another local bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Thursday's mid-rate is expected to be pegged at between 868.50 and 868.70 against 869.30 today. -- Y.J. YEOM</p>
