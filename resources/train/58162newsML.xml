<headline>Army denies Colombian capital is under siege.</headline>
<dateline>BOGOTA, Colombia 1996-09-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>A senior army official  on Tuesday dismissed as &quot;alarmist&quot; a report in Colombia's leading news magazine suggesting the country's guerrilla war could soon be fought on the streets of Bogota.</p>
<p>General Fernando Tapias, commander of the Bogota-based 5th Army Division, conceded that leftist guerrillas have long set their sights on occupying the capital and seizing political power.</p>
<p>But he said the mere existence of a rebel plan to take over the capital &quot;doesn't mean that it's feasible or that it's going to happen anytime soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's not confuse plans with realities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The cover story in the latest edition of the weekly Semana, Colombia's most influential news magazine, quoted military intelligence officials as saying Bogota was literally surrounded by guerrillas, including about 1,200 members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest and oldest rebel group.</p>
<p>Between the FARC and the National Liberation Army (ELN), Semana said an additional force of about 1,700 urban commandos or rebel &quot;militia&quot; members was already operating in the capital, based in impoverished working-class districts on the city's southern suburbs.</p>
<p>The magazine report, headlined &quot;Bogota Under Siege,&quot; added that whenever guerrillas decided to unleash an all-out offensive in Bogota they were sure to be backed by rebels moved in from outlying provinces including Tolima and Meta, a traditional FARC stronghold.</p>
<p>The Semana story hit newsstands Monday, three days after the U.S. embassy advised American residents of Bogota against travelling outside of the city limits because of a possible surge in rebel attacks in nearby areas.</p>
