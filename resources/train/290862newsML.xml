<p>Pope John Paul's visit to Cuba next year should boost the Roman Catholic Church locally and help it obtain a wider role on the communist-ruled island, a visiting cardinal said on Monday.</p>
<p>Cardinal Camillo Ruini, president of Italy's bishops' conference, told reporters at the end of a four-day visit that plans for the papal trip were the focus of a long and &quot;very interesting&quot; talk he had on Friday with President Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>Castro had been interested in how papal visits were organised, Ruini said.</p>
<p>Ruini announced the date of the Pontiff's trip to Cuba -- the second half of January 1998 -- during a mass in Havana on Friday. The trip was agreed at a landmark first meeting between the Pope and Castro last November at the Vatican, but a date had not been set.</p>
<p>The Vatican meeting marked a clear improvement in recent months in ties between the communist authorities and the church in Cuba.</p>
<p>Ruini, describing the Cuban chuch as very alive, said the papal visit should give it a further boost, as well as serving to &quot;widen the margins of liberty that the church has in Cuba.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it was clear the Cuban people were anxious to see the Pontiff.</p>
