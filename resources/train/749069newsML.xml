<p>Venezuelan police ripped apart a Panamanian registered tanker on Tuesday and discovered more than four tonnes of cocaine stashed aboard, an official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're taking the boat to pieces,&quot; Drugs Minister Carlos Tablante told Reuters. He said so far 4.1 tonnes of cocaine had been found but there could be as much as 5 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the largest single cocaine seizure we've ever made in Venezuela. In 1986, we caught 12 tonnes of marijuana,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The tanker Ricky II was stopped on Friday in a joint operation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) at Puerto Cabello, 60 miles (96 kms) west of Caracas.</p>
<p>Tablante said the bulk of the cocaine had been hidden deep in the bilge tanks, but some had also been tightly padded between concrete tiles in the ship's floors to fool sniffer dogs.</p>
<p>The ship, which stopped briefly in the Colombian port of Barranquilla after setting sail from Cartagena, was due to load a Venezuelan cargo of pulped paper and chemical products before heading for Trinidad and the United States, police said.</p>
<p>The ship's crew of nine, including a Colombian captain, Hondurans and Peruvians, were being held for questioning.</p>
<p>Although not a major producer, Venezuela has become an important transit route for drugs from neighbouring countries to the United States and Europe.</p>
