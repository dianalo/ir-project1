<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-FORECAST-Copper seen key in MIM loss.</title>
<headline>RTRS-FORECAST-Copper seen key in MIM loss.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-01-30</dateline>

<p>The slump in the copper price last year and a strong Australian dollar are expected to have driven base metals miner MIM Ltd into the red in the first half of the year, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>MIM is expected to report a net loss before abnormals and exchange losses of A$10 million to A$20 million early on Friday, due largely to a hefty loss from the Mt Isa copper operations.</p>
<p>This compares with a profit of A$23.6 million before abnormals and exchange effects in the first half of 1995/96.  </p>
<p>&quot;The key number we'll be looking for is the EBIT number for Mt Isa copper,&quot; said one Sydney analyst, adding a loss of A$50 million to A$100 million was possible on Mt Isa operations.</p>
<p>&quot;It really comes down to how much cost cutting has been achieved at Mt Isa and the extent of the exchange losses,&quot; he said. He saw a loss for MIM of A$10 million to A$15 million before abnormals and exchange losses.</p>
<p>MIM's ability to extract efficiency gains at its Mt Isa operations were seen as another key factor to watch.  </p>
<p>ANZ Securities research manager Chris Bain said he was expecting a loss of up to A$20 million and that the market was expecting a poor result. &quot;The key will be progress on Alumbrera and Ernest Henry and any updates on the industrial relations climate at Mt Isa,&quot; Bain said.</p>
<p>A weak copper price was likely to have depressed Mt Isa profits, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically all operations beside McArthur River probably made money at the operational level,&quot; a Melbourne analyst said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's just that copper has made a lot less and when you put corporate, exploration and other costs on it has made a loss in the end,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Resources director at Brisbane broker Wilson HTM, Phillip Hutchings, said he expected a loss of around A$20 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a combination of a lower copper price, a lower zinc price and a high exchange rate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have had problems in their coal operations as well.&quot;</p>
<p>MIM shares closed down three cents at A$1.74 on Thursday.</p>
