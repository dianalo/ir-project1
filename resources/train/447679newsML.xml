<p>Latin America must not falter on the road to reform but has to ensure the sustainable growth that will allow it to cast off a legacy of underdevelopment, the Inter-American Development Bank said on Monday.</p>
<p>The bank's president Enrique Iglesias told some 5,500 delegates at the IADB's 38th annual meeting the only way Latin America can shed its heritage of inequality was by striving for continuing levels of sound economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no sustainable improvement to social problems without growth,&quot; he told delegates gathered in Barcelona's national palace.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know of any other path, there is no other choice,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Latin America boasts the worst record of income distribution and has underperformed the rest of the world in extending education to the poor.</p>
<p>Latin Americans receive an average of five years' schooling compared with nine in the tiger economies of southeast Asia, the bank said. This ever-widening gap is locking the population into a cycle of deprivation.</p>
<p>&quot;If this cycle continues to the end of the century we will not only have a lost decade, but a lost generation,&quot; Iglesias said.</p>
<p>The IADB said that while Latin America had emerged from the 1995 recession faster than economists dared hope, it still needed major reforms to ensure the benefits were more equitably shared.</p>
<p>&quot;The challenge that the region now faces is to transform the recovery into sustained and shared growth,&quot; the bank said in its annual report.</p>
<p>&quot;This will require more investments, in both quantity and quality, in education and health,...a reassessment of labour market regulations and their impact on the overall economy, reform of public pension systems, and consolidation of the fiscal reforms already undertaken,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The bank said Latin America and the Caribbean grew at a rate of 3.5 percent in 1996, and forecast 4.5 percent for this year.</p>
<p>But the modest increase in growth across most of the region was matched by what preliminary figures showed was a rise in unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment remains stubbornly high, highlighting the urgent need to reassess labour market regulations,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates of investment and saving remain insufficient in most countries to sustain adequate rates of growth in output and employment opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>On the positive side, the report said inflation had fallen to its lowest in almost two decades. Private capital inflows had recovered nearly to pre-crisis levels, and nations like Argentina, Colombia and Mexico had been able to lengthen the maturity of their international debt issues, reducing their vulnerability to future crises.</p>
<p>&quot;The median rate of inflation fell to 11 percent in 1996 compared with 13 percent in 1995 and was the lowest rate since 1977,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Exports from the region rose about 13 percent, and real investment grew by nearly six percent last year.</p>
<p>Net capital flows totalled about $60 billion, the private capital proportion rebounding to its peak 1992-94 levels, it added.</p>
<p>The IADB was the leading source of multilateral lending to Latin America and the Caribbean in 1996 for the third consecutive year, approving $6.76 billion in loans and disbursing $4.37 billion.</p>
<p>Approximately a third of its loans are targeted at projects meant to help raise the standard of living and alleviate poverty in the region. --IADB Newsroom +34 3 242 2659</p>
