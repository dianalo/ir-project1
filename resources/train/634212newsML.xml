<p>U.S. spot liquefied petroleum gas prices were steady to higher in moderate activity on Tuesday amid trader interest in normal butane, players said.</p>
<p>In Conway, Kansas, normal butane popped up 1.25 cents to deals done at 39.25 cents a gallon. 39.50 cents was also done, but seen as a panic buy amid tight supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;There were mostly traders out buying but I think they are fronting for refiners,&quot; said one Conway player.</p>
<p>There was talk of refiner interest in the U.S. Gulf Coast, where normal butane was up about a quarter cent at 41.00/41.25 cents.</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf propane, however, was largely steady at 35.00/35.25 cents but Conway material was up a half cent at 37.00/37.25 cents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an international broker said Korea's strategic reserve is looking to buy within the next few days 125,000 tonnes of propane. The concern is likely to buy from Middle East suppliers.</p>
