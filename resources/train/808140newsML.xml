<p>The newly-appointed police chief of Banja Luka, a man loyal to Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, was arrested on Tuesday by state security controlled by indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic, a top security official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Milan Sutilovic was arrested by the national security people this morning and taken away in an unknown direction,&quot; Dragan Lukac, head of Plavsic's security forces, told reporters.</p>
<p>Plavsic has been locked in a power struggle with Karadzic loyalists, accusing them of rampant corruption and of damaging Serb interests by blocking the peace process.</p>
<p>She alleged on Monday that her opponents were tapping the communications of dozens of officials and prominent figures in the northern city of Banja Luka, including two judges on the constitutional court.</p>
<p>Sutilovic was named local police chief after Plavsic's security forces seized the police station on Sunday . NATO forces intervened after the takeover to prevent possible clashes between the rival factions.</p>
<p>Plavsic vowed on Monday to press for early elections to replace the hardline-dominated Bosnian Serb parliament, despite an adverse court ruling last week, and to carry on fighting what she called hardliners' &quot;terror&quot; in Serb-controlled areas of the country.</p>
<p>The reported arrest was certain to ratchet up tensions even further.</p>
<p>International police said they were investigating allegations that Bosnian Serb nationalist hardliners intimidated court judges and conducted widespread telephone tapping in their power struggle against Plavsic.</p>
<p>Special police loyal to Plavsic seized control of the Banja Luka police station before dawn on Sunday because they said the building had been used by rival police to bug the president's telephones and faxes.</p>
<p>The NATO-led peace force sent in British troops later in the day to prevent a possible clash between Plavsic supporters and police forces loyal to government hardliners.</p>
<p>While British troops stood guard, monitors from the International Police Task Force (IPTF) spent Sunday and Monday interviewing policemen and searching the five-floor building for evidence.</p>
<p>The IPTF said it was sifting through &quot;bags of evidence&quot; taken from the police station.</p>
<p>&quot;We have collected a sizeable quantity of evidence that is now being compiled and recorded,&quot; IPTF spokesman Alun Roberts said late on Monday in Banja Luka.</p>
<p>Western officials said IPTF monitors found numerous tapes and transcripts, part of an elaborate eavesdropping operation by hardliners loyal to Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb president now sought by prosecutors at the international tribunal at The Hague handling war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>In Washington, the United States said on Monday it rejected the Bosnian Serb constitutional court's ruling that Plavsic could not call early elections.</p>
<p>The Bosnian Serb cabinet, loyal to Karadzic, accuses Plavsic of being a pawn of foreign enemies allegedly plotting to divide the Serb nation.</p>
