<p>The bear market has arrived and it's growing. Not stocks, but teddy bears, which impart a warm fuzzy feeling especially if you have, say, a $170,000 Steiff original from 1904.</p>
<p>It's not the money that counts, though, for &quot;arctophiles&quot; or &quot;bearologists&quot; whose numbers are dwarfed only by stamp and coin collectors.</p>
<p>&quot;Psychologically, the bear in general is maternally probably the most protective in nature of its young. They tend to project a soulfulness that children as well as adults tend to find,&quot; said Ken Yenke, collector and dealer based in Strongsville, Ohio (216-238-5363).</p>
<p>&quot;And I think there is a little girl or boy in all of us,&quot; said British collector and connoisseur Pam Hebbs.</p>
<p>At a Christie's London auction in December, 1994, Hebbs successfully bid a record 110,000 British sterling ($169,200) on behalf of toy manufacturer Yoshihiro Sekiguchi for Teddy Girl, a 20-inch Steiff bear made in 1904. German-based Steiff is regarded as the first true teddy bear manufacturer.</p>
<p>Until then, the record holder was &quot;Happy,&quot; a 1920s Steiff bear that sold for $74,000 in 1989, Yenke said.</p>
<p>That's a far cry from the turn of the century, when a basic 12-inch high teddy bear cost 25 cents to $1. &quot;That same bear today would cost $100 to $500 per inch,&quot; depending on its rarity, quality and condition, Yenke said.</p>
<p>First made in New York in 1903, teddies got their name from a famous Washington Post cartoon of President Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt refusing to shoot a baby bear tied to a tree even though his Mississippi hunting trip had been fruitless.</p>
<p>Oct. 27, Roosevelt's birthday, is now Teddy Bear Day in several states and is celebrated with conventions and shows.</p>
<p>Originally made for boys, teddies soon became a fixture in nurseries across North America and Europe, helped by the success of A.A. Milne's series of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; books in Britain in the 1920s. The decade after World War II was also boomtime for teddies.</p>
<p>But the Bull Era for the bear market began only in the early 1980s, this time spreading to Asia, fuelled by the popular British television series &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; that featured a major character with a teddy.</p>
<p>&quot;It was only in mid-1980s that a Steiff bear auctioned for over $1,000,&quot; said Yenke. &quot;That was the beginning of the acknowledgment of the teddy bear as a three-dimensional work of art, a soft sculpture.&quot;</p>
<p>Early teddies were usually rigid, fully-jointed, hand-sewn models of mohair stuffed with wood shavings. They often had eyes made of glass or precious stones. A wider range of materials is now used, but the pattern and body style still follows the standard set by Steiff's early bears.</p>
<p>While early Steiffs -- especially rare black ones -- are the benchmark, any pre-World War II bear is also valuable and a Steiff that cost $2 in the early 1940s is now worth $2,000. Other desirable pedigrees are Farnell from Britain in the 1920s or Merrythought from England in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Modern celebrities include Muffy Vanderbera and Teddy Van Der Bear, which come with complete lines of &quot;bearaphernalia&quot; -- clothing, jewelry and ornaments -- and which have their own fan clubs.</p>
<p>For unique looks, however, collectors are increasingly snapping up hand-made bears, often autographed on the sole by the artist, for $50 to thousands of dollars each. Artists' bears are the place to start for new collectors because they are quality goods made to last, Yenke advised.</p>
<p>After all, in the bear market, it's the face that launches the blue chips. &quot;The value is almost 100 percent in the face, the look of the bear. Is the bear talking to me? It's a certain attachment or communication that some artistically made bears have,&quot; Yenke said.</p>
<p>If the face is good, a few worn spots would not reduce the teddy's value. But a damaged face on a well-kept body will certainly damage its appeal.</p>
<p>The most desirable material is mohair from the Angora goat, which is most like a real animal's fur and may cost up to $300 a yard. &quot;It's easy to clean, resists wear, and is very cuddly. It has a very realistic feel,&quot; Yenke said.</p>
<p>For new collectors with limited budgets, artists' bears are the place to start because they are quality goods made to last, Yenke advised.</p>
<p>But even if all you want is friendly company, there is an affordable bear out there as a ballerina, nurse, hiker, drummer or with just a plain sad face that speaks to you.</p>
