<p>One inmate was killed and another seriously injured in the latest round of prison violence that has taken the lives of at least six Colombians over the past week, authorities said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the National Prisons Institute said the latest bloodletting came on Wednesday in a knife fight at Bogota's La Picota prison. The spokesman said he was unable to identify the inmate who was killed but that both he and his killer, who was badly cut in the fight, were common criminals.</p>
<p>The maximum security wing of La Picota, an ageing and chronically overcrowded facility, is home to leaders of Colombia's infamous Cali drug cartel.</p>
<p>According to Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper, an average of 75 prisoners are killed and 350 injured every year in acts of violence inside Colombian prisons.</p>
<p>In a related development, authorities said negotiations with inmates holding at least 12 hostages in the prison of Valledupar, capital of northern Cesar province, were suspended for the second straight day on Thursday a week after about 10 heavily armed prisoners seized control of the facility.</p>
<p>Three guards and a policeman were killed in the takeover of the prison, which police and penal authorities say was staged to cover up an escape attempt by hardened criminals led by a former leftist guerrilla. One inmate was killed when guards forcefully ended a similar uprising on Tuesday at the Modelo prison in Bucaramanga, capital of Santander province.</p>
