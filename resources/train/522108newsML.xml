<p>London Metal Exchange copper and aluminium prices were barely changed in quiet Asia trade on Friday, as expectations that metal prices might soften further kept players sidelined, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The LME has gone through a consolidation. It could rebound again, but there's nothing to trigger a change (in direction),&quot; said one trader. &quot;The metals will remain soft for the immediate future.&quot;</p>
<p>Another trader added that, while downward pressure from fund selling ebbed, end-users held back in hopes of lower prices.</p>
<p>At 0650 GMT, LME benchmark three-month copper was quoted at $2,263/68 a tonne, down slightly from $2,270/72 at 1800 GMT on Thursday but up slightly from $2,260 at the Thursday afternoon kerb close.</p>
<p>Aluminium was quoted at $1,548/52 a tonne, down marginally from $1,550/52 at 1800 GMT on Thursday and at the close of Thursday's afternoon kerb.</p>
<p>During the day in Tokyo the dollar advanced above 126 yen from just above 125 yen earlier in the day, which also dampened interest in the market, traders said.</p>
<p>In addition, the Tokyo aluminium futures contract, which was launched at the beginning of last week, saw turnover slide to a low of 1,978 lots, against nearly 20,000 on the day of its debut.</p>
<p>One trader said this destroyed any possibility of arbitrage business.</p>
