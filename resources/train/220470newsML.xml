<p>The head of the OPEC Iraqi delegation Osama al-Hiti said that Iraqi oil could be on the market by the end of the year, but declined to comment on whether oil might flow by December 10.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot comment on that but we are all waiting to export oil as soon as possible,&quot; Hiti said. &quot;It is very possible that Iraqi oil will be on the market by the year end.&quot;</p>
<p>On the possible date of December 10 he said in a reply to a question &quot;if they move fast this can be done.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;It's very encouraging news that the process is moving forward,&quot; Hiti added.</p>
<p>He said that once the deal was implemented Iraqi output would go straight to 1.2 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>Seperately, Saddam Hassan, head of Iraqi state oil company SOMO, said that oil could flow by late December, early January.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on the logistics,&quot; Hassan said. &quot;It could be the end of December or early January, I don't know&quot;</p>
<p>He said telexes would go out to oil companies inviting their bids for the oil as soon as he returned to Baghdad from attending the current OPEC meeting in Vienna, expected to end on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said he expected the monitors to report to the U.N. around the end of the first week of December.</p>
<p>The U.N. Secretariat must then approve their report and deploy their own staff to Iraq, expected to number around 150. Once they were in place and the oil contracts were signed the first Iraqi oil exports will be on the market, he said.</p>
