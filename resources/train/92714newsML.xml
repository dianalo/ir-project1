<p>A timely start for Europe's planned currency union will be impossible without both Germany and France participating from the start, a senior Bundesbank official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But a launch on January 1, 1999, as scheduled, would also presume a very strict interpretation of the entry criteria which would be likely to keep the &quot;entire Club Med&quot; group of southern European nations outside the starting group, council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Without France, there would be a political division of Europe and without Germany the Euro would never be able to get off the ground because the anchor currency, the mark, would continually pull it down,&quot; Koebnick said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are the two nations that will set the price,&quot; for currency union, Koebnick, also president of the central bank for the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland.</p>
<p>He explained that if Europe insists on meeting a two- pronged goal of launching the currency union on time at the end of the decade with a Euro that will not be weaker than the mark, sacrifices will be inevitable.</p>
<p>If this is the goal, &quot;then one cannot allow others to join... for example the entire Club Med group cannot join,&quot; Koebnick said, referring to southern European nations, whose progress on meeting entry criteria for the currency union has been mixed.</p>
<p>Koebnick's comments coincided with a renewed flare-up in tensions among European nations after French President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday suggested that Italy would likely not be among the first nations to join the currency union.</p>
<p>Besides France and Germany, Koebnick predicted that the Netherlands, Luxembourg and probably Belgium would also be able to join the currency union at its start.</p>
<p>A more limited starting group would not bear damaging consequences for the currency union as a whole, however, particularly since surveys have shown that about 13 of the total of 15 European nations would be ready to join before the year 2002.</p>
<p>Even though some nations will remain on the periphery at the start, their consolidation efforts will be rewarded when markets will treat them like potential members, Koebnick said.</p>
<p>He added that the second group of nations would likely be able to join the currency union some two years after the union is launched.</p>
<p>At the same time Koebnick suggested that all nations may wish to consider postponing the entire launch by one or two years to give all member countries more time to complete the herculean tasks of paring budget deficits and government debt.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty on European union states that nations' budget deficits and government debt must not exceed three percent and 60 percent of GDP respectively.</p>
<p>Political leaders will determine in 1998 which nations will be eligible to join the union after reviewing their 1997 economic data.</p>
<p>&quot;A conditioned waiting for the currency union would not be catastrophe,&quot; Koebnick said, explaining that the changes that need to be implemented in order to meet convergence criteria were so massive that nations could use more time to prepare.</p>
<p>It is worth considering whether the goals &quot;would not be more in reach if one waited another year or two,&quot; to launch the currency union, Koebnick said.</p>
<p>But he also praised nations' efforts to date in meeting the convergence criteria, saying great strides had been made in harmonising interest rate levels and paring back inflation rates.</p>
<p>Echoing many Bundesbank colleagues' warnings, Koebnick urged there may be no &quot;foul compromises&quot; in determining who will be able to join the currency union as nations failing to meet the stability criteria threaten the union's viability.</p>
