<p>The United States and Taiwan have agreed to a free market aviation agreement that ends restrictions on flights between the two countries, the U.S. Transportation Department announced on Friday.</p>
<p>The accord will lift curbs on bilateral passenger and cargo operations, enabling each country to fly to any city in the other country as often as it wishes as well as to fly beyond to third countries.  </p>
<p>In addition, the department said, the agreement allows U.S. and Taiwanese carriers to market their services jointly in &quot;code-sharing&quot; arrangements.</p>
<p>It said the accord with Taiwan, along with similar ones with other Asian nations, would go into effect at some point later when enough nations had reached free market pacts to create a region-wide &quot;open skies&quot; environment.</p>
<p>The United States has already reached free market pacts with Singapore and Brunei, and Washington hopes to hold talks with other countries later, an official said.</p>
<p>The official did not say how many free market accords Washington wanted for them to take effect but said there would have to be enough so &quot;beyond rights&quot; were meaningful. This was necessary, he said, so that a U.S. carrier, for instance, could leap-frog countries, carrying passengers to and from several Asian nations.</p>
