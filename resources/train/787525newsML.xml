<p>Hoiupank led the bourse to new highs on Friday and most banking stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>Total trade on the main list was 171 million kroons as the Talse index rose 2.20 percent to close at 422.27.</p>
<p>&quot;Early trade was very nervous as bourse technical problems stopped us from seeing current quotes, but after that the prices just rose quickly,&quot; on dealer said.</p>
<p>Hoiupank set the pace during the day as it registered trade of 57.6 million kroons for a new record close of 270 kroons after gaining nine kroons.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no news for Hoiupank today and the rise was too rapid for us to feel comfortable with it,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Hoiupank rose by 40.52 percent during the week after a revised profit forecast that saw the bank doubling its earlier prediction for profits growth.</p>
<p>The pace of Hansapank's gains eased slightly to pick up only 1.6 kroons for new record close at 233.50 kroons after 33.8 million kroons changed hands.</p>
<p>Hansa and Hoiu have dominated trade during the past week with Hansa taking 23.6 percent of the week's turnover and Hoiu winning 30.69 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Forekspank regained some ground on news its correspondent account in St Petersburg had been unfrozen.</p>
<p>Along with several other Baltic banks, Forekspank's correspondent accounts were blocked by the St Petersburg tax police, which alleged that the banks owed billions of roubles in unpaid VAT.</p>
<p>A St Petersburg court over-turned the decision on Thursday, Forekspank said.</p>
<p>Foreks closed at 240 kroons, up 16 kroons after turning over 28.7 million kroons.</p>
<p>Tallinna Pank was also affected by the Russian tax police's decision but regained ground after it also announced that it was able to continue operations normally.</p>
<p>Tallinna Pank regained 3.95 kroons to close at 68.95 kroons.</p>
<p>On the free market, total trade was 5.6 million kroons.</p>
<p>Rakvere meat plant was the most active stock with 2.9 million kroons changing hands to be steady at 13 kroons.</p>
