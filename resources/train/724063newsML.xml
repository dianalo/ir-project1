<title>GREECE: GREEK RATES UP ON BOND AUCTION FUNDING.</title>
<headline>GREEK RATES UP ON BOND AUCTION FUNDING.</headline>
<dateline>ATHENS 1997-07-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Greek depos and forex forwards were trading higher in early dealings as players sought funding for the auction of five-, seven-and 10-year bonds on July 15, dealers said.</p>
<p>Yields of five-, seven- and 10-year bonds were up five to 10 ticks after coming under selling pressure from local banks. Ecu/drachma was hovering around 309.51/56 after hitting a high of 309.63/68.</p>
<p>&quot;Depos are up a fifth of a point from one-week on and forex forwards have risen about 30 basis points from one-month on as players seek funding for the auction of bonds on July 15,&quot; a dealer at a private bank said.</p>
<p>Greece will seek bids for a further 75 billion drachmas each of five- and seven-year bonds with coupons of 9.2 percent and 8.9 percent respectively, and 120 billion drachmas of 8.8 percent, 10-year bonds on July 15, the finance ministry announced late on Thursday.</p>
<p>The five- and seven-year bonds were auctioned for the first time ever on March 19 and then bids were re-opened on June 17. The 10-year bonds were auctioned for the first time ever on June 17.</p>
<p>Greece will also auction 150 billion drachmas of seven-year floating rate notes on July 29.</p>
<p>&quot;Local banks have been selling five-, seven- and 10-year bonds this morning, driving their yields up five to 10 basis points,&quot; a bond dealer said. &quot;The size of the auction, especially for 10-year bonds is large and the high cost of carry makes them unattractive.&quot;</p>
<p>The dealer said he expected little interest from foreign investors for the 10-year bond given a negative cost of carry of more than 200 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;An investor could buy into a 10-year bond if the cost of carry is about 50 basis points and the yield curve inverted but not when the cost of carry is more than 200 basis points,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 157.38/48 from Thursday's 157.480 fix, the dollar at 276.15/25 drachmas from 276.280 and the ecu at 309.69/79 from 309.55 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;Ecu/drachma is trading in familiar ranges, currently around 309.51/56 after going up to 309.63/68,&quot; said a forex dealer at foreign bank. &quot;Trading activity is calm and moderate.&quot;</p>

<p>** Overnight at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** T/N at 10.30-10.80</p>
