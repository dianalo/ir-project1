<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Wednesday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt lower amid outlooks for increased hog marketings as farmers move hogs before the Independence Day holiday on Friday, livestock dealers and packer buyers said.</p>
<p>Relatively large marketings on Tuesday also were seen weighing on cash prices, with several packer buyers in the southern Minnesota/interior Iowa area indicating they were close to having Wednesday slaughter needs filled.</p>
<p>&quot;We ended up with a good run today. I can see us backing away from the market early on Wednesday,&quot; one buyer said.  </p>
<p>Forecasts for cooler, less humid weather on Wednesday also could result in more hogs coming to market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Price declines could be tempered, however, if marketings Wednesday come in lighter than anticipated which could force packers to vie for available supplies, some sources said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to the plant on Wednesday were seen at $62.00-$62.50 and Illinois top prices could range $60.50-$61.00, sources in those areas said.</p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top prices at plants were seen at $60.50 to $61.50.</p>
