<p>Medical experts from around the world began a three-day congress on skin disease in Africa on Thursday, with host Ivory Coast urging them to speak out against skin bleaching -- a fashion among some groups of African women.</p>
<p>The conference, in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Abidjan, takes as its theme &quot;AIDS-Tumours and Skin Pigmentation Disorders in Africa&quot; -- particularly skin diseases and their link with the killer disease AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>But Ivory Coast's health minister, Maurice Kacou Guikahue, told the opening session he hoped the experts would take time from discussing the clinical aspects of skin disease to consider the social and psychological pressures behind skin bleaching.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to raise pigmentation problems, not necessarily from a scientific, principally genetic point of view, as I am sure you will do, but from the point of view of beauty care,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Ivory Coast was experiencing an increase in the use of &quot;substances sold for their miraculous effect on the complexion and which conceal numerous dangers for those that use them, notably women&quot;.</p>
<p>Doctors say skin bleaching, using a range of commercially available products to lighten dark skins, can damages the skin and sometimes permanently disfigure those using them.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that your deliberations, by dealing wth these sociological and psychological aspects, will highlight the risks and come up with strategies to stamp out this consequence of a fashion that is both dangerous and outmoded,&quot; Guikahue said.</p>
<p>The main organiser of the conference, the eighth of its kind, is the African Association of Dermatology, created in 1981.</p>
<p>A total of 227 participants from over 30 countries in Africa, Europe and the United States were attending.</p>
