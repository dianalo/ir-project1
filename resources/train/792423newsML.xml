<p>ASEAN foreign ministers arrived in Singapore on Monday to discuss how to resolve the diplomatic tangle in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Diplomats and analysts said the ministers were due to hear a report by an Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) mission which met Cambodian strongman Hun Sen, and then try to form a plan to deal with the situation in the country.</p>
<p>The situation was complicated by comments on Saturday by King Norodom Sihanouk, who said he regarded Ung Huot, elected First Prime Minister to replace ousted premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as a puppet and that his son was still premier.</p>
<p>But the king, who reigns but does not rule, earlier authorised acting head of state Chea Sim to appoint Ung Huot in Ranariddh's place.</p>
<p>&quot;The chances for consensus in ASEAN on this issue have become more laborious,&quot; an Asian diplomat said.</p>
<p>Thinakorn Kanasutra, deputy spokesman of the Thai foreign ministry, said ASEAN ministers generally agree on three points.</p>
<p>&quot;First, that the Cambodian general election should be organised in a free and fair manner, and the election date should be set as previously planned&quot; in May 1998, he said.</p>
<p>Second, politicians loyal to Ranariddh and those who fled the country should be allowed to return and resume their political activities with a guarantee of safety from Hun Sen, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Third, there should be an active effort to end the factional armed struggle in Cambodia,&quot; Thinakorn said.</p>
<p>Senator Blas Ople, chairman of the Philippine Senate foreign relations committee, told reporters ASEAN should press Hun Sen on his promise to call for early parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe, pressure should be exerted on him to keep his word,&quot; Ople said.</p>
<p>Alex Magno, a political scientist at the state-run University of the Philippines, said ASEAN may have no choice but to deal with Hun Sen and that it would be unrealistic for the group to insist on early polls.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no infrastructure for elections in Cambodia that can be built in the next three months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some members of ASEAN are keen to fulfil the vision of its founding fathers in 1967 that the group include all 10 countries in the region, making it the fourth-largest trading bloc in the world.</p>
<p>The group currently links Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Cambodia was supposed to join along with Burma and Laos last month, but its induction was postponed because of the turmoil which followed the violent overthrow of Ranariddh by Hun Sen on July 6 after two days of fighting in the capital, Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>&quot;I think ASEAN is taking a realistic view of the situation, in terms of the power configuration in Cambodia,&quot; said Julius Parrenas, executive director of the think-tank Centre for Research and Communication in Manila.</p>
<p>&quot;They will have to take the present reality as a starting point. His (Hun Sen's) military forces practically control Cambodia.&quot;</p>
<p>Hun Sen and Ranariddh formed an uneasy and increasingly divisive partnership after U.N.-run elections in 1993.</p>
