<p>The wife and children of a 65-year-old Indian had the surprise of their lives when the man showed up at his own funeral.</p>
<p>Dulal Chandra Das, who turned up on Wednesday, was missing for more than a month and presumed dead after relatives in the eastern city of Calcutta identified a body that resembled him.</p>
<p>But Das, who was suffering from anaemia, said he had gone off to pray at a temple for a miracle cure. He decided to return after a Hindu goddess appeared in his dream and told him to go back home.</p>
<p>&quot;She even told me that my sons were about to perform my shradh (last rites),&quot; Das told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I returned home and the dream turned out to be true. I am sure I will soon get cured and start my business of selling potatoes in a local market.&quot;</p>
