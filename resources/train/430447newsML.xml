<p>Rape victims in Florida have only a 50 percent chance that their story will be believed by those assigned to treat them, according to a study on sexual violence.</p>
<p>Despite national statistics showing a false report rate of less than two percent, rape victims are as likely not to be believed by hospital staff who examine them in what rape victim's advocates say is a critical step in the evidence gathering process.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that rape victims is not believed is common,&quot; Robin Hassler, executive staff coordinator for the task force, said Monday. &quot;There is a high prevalence of non-reporting because once they get involved in the system it can be such a horrible experience.&quot;</p>
<p>The study, recently completed for The Governor's Task Force on Domestic and Sexual Violence, found that hospitals often disregard statewide protocols for evidence gathering and charge up to $1,000 for rape investigations that cost only a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p>The survey, a follow-up to a 1983-84 assessment on sexual assault services, found that in many areas, little progress has been made in how hospital, law enforcement and county social service agencies deal with victims of sexual assault.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1983-84, all the counties were saying no, we have no sexual assault services,&quot; Hassler said. &quot;Twelve years later, more than half are responding that they have limited, very limited or extremely limited services. That's some progress, but we need to do a lot more.&quot;</p>
<p>The survey received 64 responses from emergency room officials across the state. Hospital staff on average said only half of rape cases they received in 1996 were &quot;valid.&quot;</p>
<p>The range of responses included seven hospitals where emergency room staff said none of the rape cases handled last year were valid. Officials at four hospitals said all cases were valid.</p>
<p>The study also found that:</p>
<p>-Despite statewide standards for how rape examinations should be conducted, hospitals often use their own procedures, which include having a law enforcement person in the room when the examination is being conducted.</p>
<p>-The average cost of a rape kit examination is about $500, though a study by the Florida Attorney General's office found that such an examination should cost about $150. In some cases, the victim is required to pay for the exam.</p>
