<p>The Algerian government on Monday told political parties they had just over a month to conform with a new law or risk exclusion from the June 5 parliamentary election.</p>
<p>&quot;Political associations have to make their names, foundations and objectives conform to the articles of the law as well as their statutes and activities,&quot; said Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour in a letter to party leaders.</p>
<p>The letter, carried by the official Algerian news agency APS, reminded party leaders the deadline for fielding candidates for the election ends on April 21 and they must make changes before then.</p>
<p>The law was approved on February 18 by the government-appointed Transitional National Council, an unelected quasi-parliament, and became law on March 6. It bans politicians from using Islam, the Arab and Berber languages, gender and regional differences to attract support.</p>
<p>One of the North African country's two legal Islamist parties, Islamic Nahda (Renaissance) Movement, was renamed last week as the Nahda Movement to conform with the law.</p>
<p>The second Islamist party, Hamas -- whose name is the Arabic acronym for Islamic Society Movement -- was expected to follow suit. Hamas leader Mahfoud Nahnah won a third of the vote in the 1995 presidential poll that confirmed Zeroual in power.</p>
<p>Algeria plunged into violence in 1992 when authorities cancelled a general election in which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had taken a huge lead. The FIS is barred from competing in the June ballot.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have died in five years of strife between Moslem guerrillas and government forces. Algeria has been without a parliament since the last  poll was scrapped.</p>
<p>Zeroual described the June 5 general elections as a path for restoring stability and rebuilding government structures through multiparty elections.</p>
