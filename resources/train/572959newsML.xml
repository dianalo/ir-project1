<p>UK producer output prices remained weak in April as the effects of lower input prices fed through to the factory gate, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The combined pressures of sterling strength and lower oil prices are set to force input prices lower again after a 0.5 percent month-on-month fall in March.</p>
<p>Producer input and output prices are due at 0830 GMT on Monday. A Reuter poll of economists forecast another 0.5 percent drop, leaving them 8.4 percent down year-on-year.</p>
<p>&quot;As input prices continue to set 10-year lows, there is little upward pressure on the output price series,&quot; said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell .</p>
<p>He forecast headline output prices to be unchanged in April, taking year-on-year growth down to 0.7 percent. The Reuter poll tipped a marginal, 0.1 percent increase in April output prices and annual inflation of 0.8 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts cited a 2.0 percent rise in the sterling trade-weighted index in April and an 8.0 percent fall in oil prices over the month as bolstering the chances of another fall in input prices.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers would probably swallow some of the reduced input costs by widening margins, analysts said the lack of pipeline price pressure would feed through to the consumer.</p>
<p>&quot;On output prices I think there's a pretty good chance of another downward turn in core output prices,&quot; said Jonathan Loynes, analyst at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>He said the Confederation of British Industry's monthly trends survey pointed to a slight dip in core output prices -- excluding food, drink, tobacco and petrol -- if not this month then next. Loynes expected a fall of 0.4 percent in April.</p>
<p>And while upstream inflationary pressures look subdued, analysts saw the weakness of export demand and price sensitivity of British consumers capping demand-pull effects.</p>
<p>&quot;While manufacturers are keeping some of the benefits of lower costs for themselves, the fragility of demand is forcing them to pass on a large share at the factory gate,&quot; said Loynes.</p>
<p>Sluggish demand combined with the strength of the pound is taking its toll on UK exports to key European markets.</p>
<p>In spite of a dramatic plunge by the pound -- more than four pfennigs -- on Thursday, its overall strength means input prices could keep falling.</p>
<p>&quot;The strength of the pound will keep input inflation falling with a drop below minus 10 percent odds on in the couple of months,&quot; Loynes said.</p>
