<p>Montgomery, Ala., plans a $30 million of general obligation bond issue for schools and capital improvements in mid- to -late May, city Finance Director Sam Austin said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Stern, Agee &amp; Leach Inc. is senior manager for the negotiated deal, with Frazier Lanier Co. Inc. and Thornton Farish Inc as co-managers.</p>
<p>The 20-year bonds are to be issued by the city under a joint agreement with Montgomery County and the county school board, with debt service repaid from sales tax revenues shared by the governments.</p>
<p>Austin said $19 million of bond proceeds will finance construction of two elementary schools and a middle school.</p>
<p>&quot;The schools will then lease them from the city and operate the schools,&quot; Austin said.</p>
<p>When the bonds are retired, the city will sell the schools to the school board for $10.</p>
<p>The remaining $11 million of bond proceeds will be used for capital improvements for the city.</p>
<p>The plan still must be approved by the Montgomery City Commission, which is scheduled for a first reading Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect it to pass,&quot; Austin said. &quot;Building schools is not controversial.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're doing it this way because the school board came to the city and county and asked for help for construction of neighborhood schools,&quot; he said.</p>
