<p>Istanbul shares eased slightly in quiet profit-taking on Thursday, amid caution after the recent sharp gains and expectations of strong resistance at 85,000, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100 ended at 83,346.09, down 426.23 points, or 0.51 percent from Wednesday's all-time high close of 83,772.33. Trade volume shrank to 16.12 trillion lira ($169 million) from Wednesday's 19.66 trillion ($206.3 million).</p>
<p>&quot;The market was in a waiting mood for most of the day. Selective purchases kept the index at above the 83,000 level because sellers were not very active,&quot; said Nermin Samiloglu from Tacirler securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said nine-month profit expectations fuelling selective demand in recent days might ease in coming days as companies announce their figures by Friday the latest.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the index to ease after testing 85,000 after next week's holiday. Initial support is awaited at 80,000,&quot; said Filiz Tiken from Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bank.</p>
<p>Turkish markets will be closed on Monday afternoon and Tuesday due to Republic Day holiday.</p>
<p>The index had surged 29.3 percent from September 13 to Wednesday, breaking ten record closes in the strong medium-term uptrend which began with the breaching of 65,000 barrier.</p>
