<p>A spokesman for Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice on Thursday said the governor's office would soon decide how to respond to the state Supreme Court's rejection of his legal challenge to the state attorney general's $940 million suit against the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The Office of the Governor will carefully review the Supreme Court's written opinion and will make a decision in the near future on the appropriate course of action,&quot; Mark Garriga, Fordice's chief of staff, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;At the core of this case is a serious inconsistency and injustice,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The Mississippi Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a legal challenge that Fordice, a Republican, brought against a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Mike Moore, a Democrat seeking to recoup Medicaid funds spent to treat smokers.</p>
<p>Garriga said the governor must respect the ruling. &quot;However,&quot; he added, &quot;the people of our state would have been better served by a direct and speedy resolution of such an important constitutional question.&quot;</p>
<p>Mississippi became the first state to file a Medicaid suit on May 23, 1994. Fordice had challenged the suit, claiming that only he had the authority to bring lawsuits to recover that money because the state's division of Medicaid is under the control of his office.</p>
<p>&quot;The governor has consistently expressed his concern that this tobacco litigation will gain Mississippi an unfavorable reputation as a haven for anti-business litigation and hurt our economic development efforts,&quot; Garriga said.</p>
