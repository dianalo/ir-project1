<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</title>
<headline>S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-04-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Key South African long bonds ended near their previous closing levels on Friday after a mixed reaction to U.S. jobs data which some U.S. analysts said pointed to a possible tightening of U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>However, local traders were optimistic that the market could move firmer next week, supported by technical factors and despite the gloomy outlook in the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect to see a bullish movement on the back of technicals and also on expectations that most of the local economic fundamentals will peak within the next two months and then trend better,&quot; a trader at a major bank said.</p>
<p>At 1645 GMT the R150 stock yielded 15.16 percent from 15.15 percent late on Thursday.</p>
<p>The trader said there was downside potential at the start of next week with 15.02 percent a key level, followed by the 15 percent figure.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously the U.S. will be a major focus but on the whole I am bullish...there is buying interest,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year T-bond was last at 7.13 percent from 7.07 percent before the data was released.</p>
<p>Overall the jobs data was in line with expectations with average U.S. hourly earnings increasing by 0.4 percent but the U.S. market focused on the average hourly earnings gain which put the year-on-year levels at four percent -- a seven-year high.</p>
<p>Several U.S. analysts said a tightening of interest rates at a Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on May 20 now appeared a safe bet.  </p>
<p>Foreigners were net sellers of 35.99 million rand's worth of South African bonds on Thursday after buying 289.08 million rand's worth on Wednesday, the Bond Exchange said.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative volumes were pegged at 37.53 billion rand on Thursday -- a settlement date -- from 3.99 billion rand on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The rand ended the day slightly firmer on the U.S. unit after another listless, range-bound session.</p>
<p>Morning trade was characterised by local exporter dollar and offshore dollar sales matched by local importer and offshore demand and there was little movement in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;The week has been a non-event save for Tuesday when the rand moved below the 4.40 level...next week should be better but the market is generally looking for longer-term direction,&quot; a forex dealer commented.</p>
<p>At 1420 GMT the rand was at 4.4140/4170 on the dollar from 4.4165/4195 late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the rand was last at 7.2410/2512 against sterling from 7.2504/2598 and at 0.3785/3788 marks from 0.3772/3775 marks.</p>
<p>Short-term money market rates were quoted steady with three-month deposit rates all at 16.55 percent offered while the 90-day BA rate moved higher to between 15.90 to 16.15 percent from 15.90 to 16.10 percent.</p>
<p>South Africa's money market shortage rose above the 11 billion mark to 11.058 billion rand on Thursday from 10.811 billion rand on Wednesday, the Reserve Bank said.</p>
