<p>LIFFE cocoa futures may succumb to downward pressure after their recent dazzling rally, but the overall bullish trend remains intact, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Coffee should continue to show a downside bias after several unsuccessful attempts to recover from recent losses.</p>
<p>In white sugar, the market is expected to test barriers to the upside after exhausting the fund-led downward movement from last week.</p>
<p>Cocoa's run-up, when benchmark September hit a 12-month-high of 1,162 stg a tonne, slowed by the end of the week as prices failed to clear the subsequent triple top at 1,150 stg.</p>
<p>Since early June the contract had risen by 15 percent on a cocktail of factors including chart-driven speculator and fund buying.</p>
<p>Others had linked the rally to aggressive short covering by manufacturers, bullish prospects for the coming 1997/98 crop and concern over the impact of the El Nino weather pattern on future harvests.</p>
<p>But while a downward correction was inevitable, traders said the long-term upward momentum still remained in place.</p>
<p>Net speculator positions in London were long by around a hefty 18,000 lots while manufacturers were still short despite the recent buying spree.</p>
<p>German grinders were seen as aggressive buyers, despite rising prices and the strong sterling/mark ratio.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows that they are bullish,&quot; said one French trader.</p>
<p>The market would start seeing the arrivals of mid-crop cocoa from Ivory Coast and Nigeria from this week. Although the crops were slightly delayed, quality was said to be good.</p>
<p>Traders would also be watching second quarter European cocoa grind data expected this week for guidance on market direction.</p>
<p>The data might show a mixed trend across Europe. But traders said the current wet spell in the region could help to boost the seasonally low demand for confectionery.</p>
<p>Coffee prices were likely to fall rather than rise, traders said.</p>
<p>Brazil's coffee belt had so far escaped damaging frost and fund players were moving out of coffee futures, they said.</p>
<p>Open interest in New York had fallen sharply to around 20,000 lots, deterring new fund involvement, while liquidity in London was being curbed by concerns over the high failure rate for coffee graded by the exchange.</p>
<p>July would enter the month-long delivery period on July 1 amid worries over low availability of tenderable coffee.</p>
<p>There had been persistent rumours that a substantial amount of arabica coffee from Europe would come up for New York grading, although some traders were sceptical.</p>
<p>On the Brazilian weather front, there had just been one close call for frost so far this winter season, which lasts at least until the first half of August.</p>
<p>In white sugar, trade buying was expected to support London's nearby August contract as it hovered around $320 support, recovering from last week's fund-led sell-off.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade do need to buy August,&quot; said one trader. &quot;I think they've waited too long, they've become greedy and now they're having to pay up for it.'</p>
<p>But August still needed to gain another couple of dollars to regain its average value from two weeks ago, before one leading commission house persistently sold the position for what was believed to be speculator clients.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the market appeared to have exhausted its downward trend and a test of resistance could be on the cards after the recent upside reversal.</p>
<p>&quot;There is now a good chance that the down move has run its course,&quot; said Adrian Haylor, a technical analyst at Sucden, adding that $325 could now be challenged.</p>
<p>In New York, the spot July contract would expire at close of business on Monday, but traders said they expected that a hefty posting of against actuals business would reduce the large open interest still outstanding.</p>
