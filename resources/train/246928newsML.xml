<p>A committee grouping three of India's most powerful economic administrators on Tuesday discussed the country's capital market, hit by three-year lows on the bourses, authorities said.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor C. Rangarajan, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairman D.R. Mehta and Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahlulwalia, the most senior bureaucrat in the Finance Ministry, attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Later, SEBI's board of directors independently discussed the state of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing to say now,&quot; Rangarajan told reporters after the meetings.</p>
<p>Mehta told reporters that SEBI's role in attempts to revive sagging stock markets was limited. &quot;SEBI cannot push up prices or bring the prices down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good forum where factual position is made known,&quot; Mehta said of the high-powered committee.</p>
<p>&quot;While taking note of the decline (in the stock markets), it was felt that SEBI's role in the matter would be limited to further improving regulatory aspects, towards which several steps had either been taken or were in the process of being taken,&quot; SEBI said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mehta said SEBI, which is a regulatory body, can help the market only to the extent of boosting investor confidence which could increase investments in the bourses.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, SEBI's board approved rights issues by mutual funds subject to conditions that would protect the market value of close-ended funds.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange's sensitive index closed down 16.49 points on Tuesday at 2,798.57, well off the year high of 4,131.22.</p>
<p>Various reasons, ranging from a slowdown in economic growth, high interest rates and political uncertainties are being cited for the decline in the stock markets.</p>
