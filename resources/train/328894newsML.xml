<p>ING Groep NV is maintaining its forecast of 10 percent annual growth in profits despite an expected easing of strong world economic conditions, executive board chairman Aad Jacobs said on Thursday.</p>
<p>He also reiterated the Dutch financial services giant's forecast in November that earnings per share (EPS) in 1996 would be between seven and 12 percent above a year earlier.</p>
<p>In an interview, Jacobs said world economic conditions were very attractive but that this was not expected to last.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no secret the economic climate worldwide is not bad. Capital markets in general are doing very well. We have very very good results in our loan portfolio,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to expect that will be the case in the coming years. It's logical to expect that will change a little. If it doesn't change too much, I am optimistic for the coming years.&quot;</p>
<p>ING forecast 10 percent annual growth in net profits after it was formed in the merger of NMB Postbank and insurer Nationale Nederlanden five years ago.</p>
<p>The actual increase since then has been 14 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no reason to expect that we have to change our forecast for the coming years. Ten percent in a reasonable economic climate is achievable,&quot; Jacobs said.</p>
<p>He said the risks to this scenario were the possibility of higher interest rates, which would cut equity and bond prices, reducing turnover in those markets and making trading difficult.</p>
<p>But higher rates were attractive for the insurance side of the business.</p>
<p>&quot;We can make money in every economic climate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jacobs also said the group aimed for 20 percent annual growth in profit from from its foreign operations.</p>
<p>Offshore profit growth would outstrip that in the Netherlands, allowing ING to boost the proportion of earnings coming from outside its small home market to its target of 40 percent by 2000, from 30 percent now. &quot;For such a big company, ING is a little bit lop-sided,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jacobs also said the forecast made in November that EPS in 1996 would be seven to 12 percent above 1995 remained unchanged, although some anlysts expected a higher increase.</p>
<p>&quot;We are always conservative and we are very proud of being conservative,&quot; he said. EPS in 1995 was 3.84 guilders, after allowing for a share split.</p>
