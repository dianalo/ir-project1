<headline>Mexico issues new charge against publisher.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico's Finance Ministry said on Tuesday it brought a new tax fraud charge against the publisher of one of Mexico's leading newspapers.</p>
<p>The ongoing case has led El Universal newspaper to accuse the government of a crude attempt at censorship because the once pro-government daily has turned independent recently.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said in a statement that a judge in Mexico City issued a new arrest warrant against Juan Francisco Ealy Ortiz, publisher of El Universal, for cheating the government out of 11.48 million pesos, about $1.44 million.</p>
<p>Combined with earlier charges of tax evasion, interest and penalties, Ealy Ortiz owes 33.85 million pesos, about $4.25 million, the ministry said.</p>
<p>But a top editor at El Universal said a higher judge on Tuesday issued an order overruling the arrest order.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Ealy Ortiz) is neither a fugitive nor can he be arrested,&quot; Roberto Rock told Reuters.</p>
<p>In the complex case that dates to last September, an array of charges have been filed and revoked against Ealy Ortiz. In September, Ealy Ortiz turned himself in to be arrested but was released almost immediately on bail.</p>
<p>Rock said there were only two charges against him now, but insisted they were politically motivated.</p>
<p>&quot;The message to the media is don't practice independent journalism,&quot; Rock said.</p>
