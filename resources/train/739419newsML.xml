<p>Jailed East Timorese resistance leader Xanana Gusmao told Portuguese radio Renascenca that the United Nations must play a more active role in resolving the problems of the troubled territory.</p>
<p>In an interview broadcast on Friday, Gusmao said he was encouraged by the new U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan's commitment to helping East Timor which was invaded by Indonesia after the Portuguese pulled out of the colony in 1975.</p>
<p>&quot;(Former UN secretary general) Boutros Boutros-Ghali was too passive...He gave the impression that the U.N. feared Jakarta would break off the talks,&quot; Gusmao told Renascenca during an interview smuggled out of the Jakarta prison where he is serving a 20-year sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;The secretary general must play a more influential and decisive role...I believe that Koffi Annan will fulfil his commitment to East Timor. The steps he has taken so far are more encouraging than in previous years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gusmao and other rebels have fought a low-level guerrilla war against the Indonesian annexation of East Timor in 1976. This move was never recognised by the U.N. which still regards Portugal as the territory's administering power.</p>
<p>U.N.-sponsored meetings of the Portuguese and Indonesian foreign ministers last month led to an agreement that senior officials of the two sides would hold more substantial talks on East Timor beginning on July 28.</p>
<p>Gusmao said that the European Union, led by Portugal, needed to back up the U.N.'s efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;For as long as the European Union continues to be generously understanding towards Jakarta and the ASEAN countries so that it doesn't lose its markets in southwest Asia, we'll keep on waiting for more to be done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if the situation in East Timor had changed since Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo and resistance spokesman Jose Ramos Horta were jointly awarded the 1996 Nobel Peace prize, Gusmao said: &quot;Apart from the euphoria, basically nothing has changed.&quot;</p>
