<headline>Lower, but lacklustre day seen for German shares.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>German shares were expected to trade lower on Friday following an overnight decline on Wall Street and some pressure on the dollar, but volumes were expected to be thin.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market lacked clear direction going into the weekend and was somewhat uncertain ahead of an expiry deadline this session for options on the blue chip DAX index and some of its constituents.</p>
<p>The 30-share IBIS DAX was down 10.73 points at 3,351.07 points at 0735 GMT, more than thirty points off its mid-afternoon close at the end of bourse trade on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We haven't had any real orders,&quot; said a trader at a large Frankfurt bank. &quot;Things are just creaking along.&quot;</p>
<p>There were few outstanding movements among blue chip shares. Chemical giant Hoechst AG managed to recoup some of its losses fron late on Thursday to trade up 15 pfennigs at 64.50 marks, but was still sharply below its bourse trade close of 66.45 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers linked Hoechst's decline with presentations the company had made to investors in London.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz AG, another decliner from Thursday, was up 35 pfennigs at 132.70 marks.</p>
