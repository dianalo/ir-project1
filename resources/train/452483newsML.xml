<p>Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko has left hospital in Europe after cancer treatment and aides say he will return home by the end of the week.</p>
<p>But back in Zaire, where Laurent Kabila's fast-spreading revolt has put the army to flight in the east, confusion reigns after a disputed vote in parliament to sack Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo and his government.</p>
<p>The Army chief of staff, General Mahele Lieko Bokoungo, played down rumours of an army coup but suggested a deepening rift with the government by demanding that the military take charge of arms purchases and distribution.</p>
<p>Political sources say coup rumours are based in fact, with some officers anxious to protect their interests but hesitant about acting.</p>
<p>&quot;The intention is still there but they are unable to do it,&quot; said former government minister Joseph Kanyonga of the opposition Action Movement for the Resurrection of Congo (MARC).</p>
<p>&quot;If they go ahead with a military takeover it will be swept away soon afterwards and can only precipitate the arrival of the army of Kabila.&quot;</p>
<p>Rumours of Mobutu's death have swept the capital since the weekend, compounding confusion.</p>
<p>Zaire has no constitutional successor to Mobutu, 66, who has dominated the sprawling Central African nation since seizing power in 1965.</p>
<p>Under the interim constitution, the head of the transitional parliament should succeed Mobutu in the event of his death. Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo resigned from the job in 1995 and has not been replaced.</p>
<p>A Mobutu supporter is one of the deputy speakers, an opposition supporter the other.</p>
<p>Supporters of Zaire's main political opposition leader, veteran radical Etienne Tshisekedi, insist Tuesday's vote in parliament to sack Kengo and nominate a government to negotiate with the rebels stands.</p>
<p>State radio even went so far as to report that Zaire now had no government. Sources close to the radio said later it had been hoaxed into carrying the report by someone purporting to represent Mobutu.</p>
<p>Mobutu, if he comes, will be returning to a city very different to the one that turned out to welcome him on December 17 on his first trip back after cancer surgery in Europe in August.</p>
<p>The rebels, who control over a fifth of Zaire, have vowed to march on Kinshasa and topple him.</p>
<p>Residents of the teeming capital's poorer quarters openly support Kabila and welcome rebel advances, which have also taken them deep into the southern mining province of Shaba.</p>
<p>In December, Mobutu reshuffled the government and the army command. A much-heralded army January counter-offensive flopped in the face of rebel advances on several fronts.</p>
<p>A March poll showed his popularity had slumped in Kinshasa with only 13 percent admitting to a good opinion of him.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, Kengo was in Kenya on Wednesday for regional talks on the war.</p>
<p>African leaders there repeated a call for an immediate ceasefire and talks. The United States endorsed the call. The rebels were not invited.</p>
<p>In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said a team of U.S. military specialists was on its way to Zaire to study airfields, roads and communications in case a decision was made to evacuate Americans.</p>
