<p>The Clinton administration urged the business community on Friday to use its political clout to build support for the expansion of NATO.</p>
<p>Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that NATO enlargement is one of a number of issues that will determine whether the United States continues as a world leader into the next century.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be one of a very small number of votes the Congress of the United States will take in the decade of the 1990's that will determine whether America continues to be an outward looking leader in the world of nations,&quot; Summers said.</p>
<p>NATO leaders were due to meet in Madrid in July to decide which Eastern European countries will be formally invited to join the long-time Western alliance as its first post-Cold War members.</p>
<p>Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were considered certain to be invited but Romania and Slovenia were also under consideration.</p>
<p>Summers said in his prepared text that NATO enlargement will have to be ratified by the governments of all 16 NATO allies. It will require a two-thirds vote in the U.S. Senate plus a majority vote in both chambers to provide the necessary funding. He said it will also require clear support from the American public.</p>
<p>&quot;The American business community can play a key role in the educational effort we need to achieve that kind of support,&quot; Summers said. &quot;Both here and abroad people listen to what we in the government may say, but they watch to see what you in the business community do.&quot;</p>
<p>Summers said NATO enlargement was in the interest of the business community because it will help secure the move toward market democracies by the former communist countries and help encourage settlement of old border and ethnic disputes.</p>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other Russian leaders oppose NATO expansion, but Summers said he thought enlargement could help foster Moscow's integration into the West by bringing more stability to the region.</p>
