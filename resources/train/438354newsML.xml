<title>UK: REED PROFITS INCREASE 11 PERCENT.</title>
<headline>REED PROFITS INCREASE 11 PERCENT.</headline>

<p>Reed Elsevier Plc, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, on Wednesday reported an 11 percent rise in group pre-tax profit for 1996 and said it planned a two-for-one share split.</p>
<p>Profits rose to 805 million stg from 723 million a year before, on turnover from continuing operations which rose to 3,381 million stg from 3,205 million.</p>
<p>Analysts had mostly expected profits to be in a range between 808.0 million stg and 821.4 million.</p>
<p>For shareholders in Reed International Plc , the company's UK arm, the dividend was raised to 27.2 pence per share from 24.5p.</p>
<p>Joint chairmen Herman Bruqqink and Nigel Stapleton said the results &quot;demonstrate the quality of the portfolio, with strong organic profit growth, high and increasing operating margins and substantial cash flow conversion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to benefit from the growing demand for high quality information and the widening opportunities, stimulated by technology changes, for introducing new products and services,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to see good underlying growth from our business and we look forward to the future with confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>They warned that the strength of sterling, if it continued, would have a &quot;marked effect&quot; on group results, though figures for the Dutch arm would gain even as the sterling figures were cut back.</p>
<p>The company said its proposed share split would be put to the vote at its annual general meeting in April, to take effect the following month.</p>
<p>It gave no reason for the change, though companies often opt to split their stock if its market value grows to well above average. Dividing an expensive stock is sometimes believed to make it more liquid or tradeable.</p>
