<p>Results at German steel group Thyssen AG were unsatisfactory in the traditionally weak first quarter, but should pick up as the business year progresses, chief executive Dieter Vogel said on Monday.</p>
<p>According to remarks ($2.03) prepared for Thyssen's annual news conference, Vogel said that the group was on course despite the slow first quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the uptrend to resume after the traditionally weak first quarter,&quot; Vogel said.</p>
<p>All three business divisions achieved positive operating results, but turnover was down six percent compared to the same quarter a year earlier at 8.7 billion marks.</p>
<p>Vogel said that disposals had knocked 570 million marks off turnover in the first quarter, which began in October. On a comparable basis, turnover was flat on a year earlier, he said.</p>
