<p>Swiss retail group Jelmoli Holding AG, in which investor Walter Fust recently acquired a majority, said its board of directors had decided to ask shareholders in May 1997 to approve a dividend payout on 1996 results based on the company's excellent profit prospects.</p>
<p>Jelmoli said in a statement the actual dividend will first be announced in April, 1997, but would be somewhere around twice the size of last year's dividend paid by Dipl. Ing. Fust AG.</p>
<p>Fust's 1995 dividend amounted to 11 Swiss francs plus a two franc anniversary bonus.  </p>
<p>The prospect for profits in 1996 are mainly based on the secure earning's pillars of properties and Fust, it added.</p>
<p>In November Walter Fust raised his stake in Jelmoli to 51.9 percent from 11.3 percent. Fust sold the majority of Dipl. Ing. Fust, the firm he founded, to Jelmoli two years ago.</p>
<p>The Jelmoli concern, which has been paring down its holdings, now has a Zurich department store and properties, travel firm Imholz Reisen, and a stake in Dipl. Ing. Fust, a consumer electronics and appliance group. Jelmoli's interests also include dry-cleaning chain Terlinden and opticians Kochoptik.</p>
<p>Jelmoli also announced that it had now sold its stake in Glattzentrum, a shopping centre in the outskirts of Zurich, to retail chain Globus.</p>
<p>Jelmoli had transferred the operation of its department store in Glattzentrum to Globus in August 1, 1996.</p>
<p>The sale amounts to a book profit to Jelmoli of more than 100 million francs, around half the sales price.</p>
<p>&quot;This sale confirms the fact that Jelmoli Holding AG's properties contain important hidden reserves worth several hundred of millions,&quot; Jelmoli said.</p>
<p>Based on the sale of the Glattzentrum property and others in Balexert, Winterthur, Biel, Martigny and Davos, Jelmoli expects a high extraordinary result in 1996.</p>
<p>Jelmoli also expects an improvement in its 1996 operating and finance results based on steady operating earnings from Fust, Imholz, Kochoptik, Terlinden and Appleseed's of the U.S. and the continued restructuring of the Jelmoli department and mail order activities.</p>
