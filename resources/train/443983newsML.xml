<p>		     DAY'S RANGE * SUPPORT * RESTNCE* MA-25 * MA-200</p>
<p> Greenalls	   545-555   *   540   *   560  *  554  *  572</p>
<p>---------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - March 14 -------------</p>
<p>+ Greenalls Group shares shares are perilously close to being sucked under 550p chart support which may then take them down to 500p, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>+ The shares' flat performance over the past 12 months implies a topping out process and their relative strength against the All-Share index plus their position below the 200 day moving average would make a rally difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Shares in drinks company Greenalls Group are precariously close to falling below chart support at 550p and if this happens it will herald a further slide in the share price, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Shares in this leading brewing company have broken below support centred on 550p (on March 11) and look capable of further weakness,&quot; said Richard Marshall, a director at Investment Research of Cambridge Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;The next level of support is at 500p,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>At 1040 GMT, the shares were down 2p to 551-1/2p.</p>
<p>The stock had moved higher with long bouts of consolidation since 1992 and its upward run from 405p in March 1995 looked to have ended when the shares peaked at 630p in April 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;A top area extending back over 12 months will have been confirmed once the price closes below 540p,&quot; said Marshall.</p>
<p>A chart of Greenalls relative strength to the All-Share index highlights the stock's weakness. Because the shares have moved sideways over the past 12 months while the stock market has gone on to make record highs this has left Greenalls relative strength line now decaying below its own previous chart support which was set in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;A bearish relative strength ratio is already signalling trouble for bulls of this stock,&quot; said Marshall.</p>
<p>The downtrend is further illustrated by Greenalls long-term moving average which is weakening and the share price has failed to go above it ever since it cut below the 200 day average at the start of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The 200 day moving average, currently situated around 570p, is now falling and acting as resistance,&quot; said Marshall pointing to the difficulty the shares may have in rallying.</p>
