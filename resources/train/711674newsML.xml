<headline>Slovenia's SBI index falls after 12 days of gains.</headline>

<p>Slovenia's SBI index eased one percent on Monday to end a 12-day winning streak and traders said the fall was due to profit-taking after recent high gains.</p>
<p>Traders said the market may fall prey to further profit-taking unless foreign players decide to jump back in.</p>
<p>The SBI index eased 15.76 points or 1.08 percent to 1,444.3.</p>
<p>Overall 14 shares fell, five rose and nine were untraded. Turnover fell to 279.5 million tolars from 481.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The market calmed down, which I think is normal after a rise of over 15 percent last week. The central bank's decree is long-term orientated so real effects can only be seen after a longer period,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago the Bank of Slovenia decided to relax rules for international portfolio investors buying securities for periods of seven years or more.</p>
<p>Banks said the new decree would enable them to reduce costs of fiduciary accounts significantly in cases of long-term investments, but gave no estimate of the new costs.</p>
<p>Foreign investments have been blocked since February when the central bank ordered foreigners to open custody accounts in order to be able to trade in shares.</p>
<p>Market participants forecast the index could easily rise to between 1,800 and 1,900 points until the end of the year.</p>
<p>Drug company Lek was the most active, falling 3.47 percent to 32,820 tolars on volume of 4,545 shares for total turnover of 151.1 million tolars.</p>
<p>Financial consultancy Primofin led decliners, tumbling 9.94 percent to 8,105 tolars on volume of only 10 shares.</p>
<p>Brokerage Finmedia was the top gainer, rising 3.36 percent to 11,990 tolars on volume of only one share.</p>
<p>Petrol trader Petrol, which traders said is one of the most attractive shares for foreign investors, eased 0.55 percent to 19,960 tolars on volume of 3,486 shares for total turnover of 71.1 million tolars.</p>
