<p>Palestinians officials said on Thursday they feared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would try in negotiations next week to redefine Israel-PLO peace deals to suit his right-wing ideology.</p>
<p>Frustrated by what they view as the failure of this week's Washington peace summit, the officials said violence could erupt again unless accords signed with Israel's previous centre-left government were implemented soon.</p>
<p>Palestinians and Israeli negotiators meet on Sunday in Gaza to discuss Israel's long-delayed troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron. Netanyahu is insisting on security modifications which he has yet to spell out publicly.</p>
<p>&quot;They're trying unilaterally to redefine the peace process according to their ideology. This is entirely unacceptable,&quot; said Hanan Ashrawi, minister of higher education in the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>&quot;Signed agreements should be implemented and not manipulated according to their way of thinking,&quot; she told Reuters, underlining the PLO's refusal to renegotiate peace deals.</p>
<p>Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said since Netanyahu's government took office last June pledging to seek peace with security, its aim has been to find ways reshape accords.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been trying to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict through imposing the Likud ideology on accords by trying to contain the Palestinian people and restricting Palestinian powers even in areas under PLO control to prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state,&quot; Asfour told Reuters.</p>
<p>Citing security concerns, Israel has maintained a closure on the West Bank and Gaza since a wave of suicide bombings in the Jewish state in February and March.</p>
<p>It clamped an &quot;internal closure&quot; on the West Bank, banning Palestinian travel between self-ruled towns, since 73 Arabs and Jews were killed in clashes triggered by Netanyahu's opening of an entrance to an archaeological tunnel in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Before the latest crisis, Netanyahu pressured the Palestinians to close three offices which he charged were conducting self-rule business in Arab East Jerusalem, which is under Israeli control.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who opposes trading occupied land for peace, has said he would never agree to a Palestinian state and envisioned a final settlement that would give Palestinians &quot;autonomy&quot; but keep security in Israeli hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel's approach is sufficient to reignite the process of confrontation, and it will spill into the whole region,&quot; Asfour said.</p>
<p>Clinton indirectly criticised Netanyahu for putting heavy emphasis on security when the U.S. leader told a White House news conference after the summit on Wednesday: &quot;Just as there can be no peace without security, there can be no true security without peace.&quot;</p>
