<p>Katyusha rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into a town in northern Israel on Friday, escalating a flare-up of cross-border violence.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said a woman was slightly injured in the attack, which damaged a synagogue where worshippers had gathered for morning prayers in the Upper Galilee town of Kiryat Shmona.</p>
<p>It was the first time Katyushas had hit the town in the more than 15 months since Israel and pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas undertook not to fire on civilian targets.</p>
<p>Hizbollah, which is fighting to drive Israeli troops and their local Lebanese militia allies from Israel's southern Lebanon occupation zone, denied it launched the attack.</p>
<p>But the group's secretary-general, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, told a news conference in Beirut that Hizbollah would resume Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel because the 1996 accord had failed to protect Lebanese civilians.</p>
<p>Nasrullah's warning followed threats by Hizbollah earlier this week to carry out attacks inside Israel, sharpening Israeli public unease in the wake of a double suicide bombing by Islamic militants that has plunged Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking deeper into crisis.</p>
<p>Israeli military sources said they believed Hizbollah was responsible for the Kiryat Shmona raid and had issued its denial apparently out of fear of Israeli retaliation.</p>
<p>The rocket strike followed an upsurge of fighting between Israeli forces and Hizbollah since Monday in which 13 people have been killed, seven of them civilians in Lebanon.</p>
<p>The flare-up coincides with a deep crisis between Israel and the Palestinians after two Islamic militant suicide bombers killed 13 other people in a Jerusalem market on July 30.</p>
<p>U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross is due in the region on Saturday on a mediation mission which Washington has said will focus on Israeli insistence on enhanced security.</p>
<p>Israel has halted peace talks with the PLO in response to the market bombings and sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, stopping trade, preventing Palestinians from getting to jobs in Israel and freezing financial transfers.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has slammed the blockade as a declaration of war and told Palestinians to &quot;prepare for what will come&quot;.</p>
<p>His statement, and angry words from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, drew a sharp rebuke on Thursday from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who urged both sides to revive a spirit of partnership on peace.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has accused Arafat of facilitating the work of the bombers and said he must crack down on militants before peace negotiations can resume.</p>
<p>The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Friday quoted him as telling a closed door meeting that Arafat was acting &quot;like Saddam Hussein in Iraq&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;He sacrifices the Palestinian people on the altar of his stubbornness. He is playing with the suffering of the Palestinians,&quot; Netanyahu was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The Israeli leader has said he will ease his economic and security clampdown on Palestinian areas only in response to proof that Arafat is getting tough on &quot;terrorism&quot;.</p>
<p>An opinion poll published on Friday in Yedioth Ahronoth showed 71 percent of Israelis backed Netanyahu's blockade.</p>
<p>But the poll, by the Dahaf Institute, showed that 66 percent favoured renewing peacemaking and only 32 percent were in favour of halting it. Two percent had no response.</p>
<p>Israel and the PLO had been on the brink of renewing committee-level talks on confidence-building measures, such as opening air and sea ports in Gaza, when the suicide bombers struck.</p>
<p>Formal peace negotiations were suspended in March after Israel broke ground for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Lebanon violence this week began on Monday with an Israeli commando raid in which five Hizbollah fighters were killed with a roadside bomb.</p>
<p>Israel and Hizbollah reached an understanding not to attack civilian targets as part of a 1996 ceasefire that ended a 17-day Israeli onslaught in which about 200 people, mainly Lebanese civilians, were killed.</p>
<p>Israel's opposition Labour party leader Ehud Barak, a former army chief of staff, told Reuters in Kiryat Shmona that he hoped a way could be found to stop the situation deteriorating through talks with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.</p>
<p>He said the Katyusha strike was &quot;the result of a major blow that the IDF (Israeli military) has been inflicting upon the Hizbollah in the last few days&quot;.</p>
