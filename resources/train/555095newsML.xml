<headline>FEATURE - Saudi prince with Midas touch diversifies.</headline>

<p>What have Euro Disney, Canary Wharf, Citicorp, Saks Fifth Avenue, Michael Jackson, Apple Computer, Trans World Airlines, Planet Hollywood and New York's Plaza Hotel got in common?</p>
<p>The answer is Prince al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, billionaire nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia as a strategic investor with a penchant for putting his money into global super-brands and high name-recognition businesses.</p>
<p>His targets have usually fallen on hard times. Often, his injection of capital has helped them to get back on their feet.</p>
<p>His investment empire based on construction and under the umbrella of his Kingdom Establishment embraces banking, property and famous leisure businesses including landmark luxury hotels, cruise and air lines, tourism and entertainment.</p>
<p>Waleed, 40 in March, is a mogul in a modern mould. He is an active investor with all the trappings of the truly mega-rich -- his own Boeing airliner, a large luxury yacht in the French Riviera, a fleet of cars and a retinue of attentive advisers. The telephone is never far from his ear.</p>
<p>He lives in a palace in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with his wife and two children.</p>
<p>BUYING SPREE BEGAN WITH CITICORP</p>
<p>The prince started his international buying spree with purchases of stock in U.S. banking giant Citicorp. His stake eventually reached $800 million.</p>
<p>Shares in the Disneyland theme park near Paris, New York retailer Saks Fifth Avenue, London's huge skyscraper Canary Wharf, New York's Plaza Hotel and the Mediaset television and advertising business of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi followed.</p>
<p>Most recently he has added five percent stakes in TWA, Apple Computer and Norwegian Cruise Lines to his portfolio of solid brand names.</p>
<p>And he is planning to develop a string of Planet Hollywood theme restaurants across the Middle East.</p>
<p>Last year he signed a deal with U.S. singer Michael Jackson to work together in joint ventures including concerts, films, television, theme parks and hotels.</p>
<p>The contract between the Saudi prince and the controversial pop star, which was said at the time to be based on &quot;family values&quot;, was one of Waleed's few investments about which nothing has been heard since.</p>
<p>LATEST BUYS PART OF NEW TREND</p>
<p>Acquisitive trophy-hunter or shrewd global investor with a Midas touch and a reputation for betting against the odds on ailing household names?</p>
<p>Financial sources close to the prince describe his latest investments as part of a new trend of diversifying away from property and entertainment.</p>
<p>&quot;Geography or sectors don't mean anything to me as long as the price is low and the potential is good,&quot; he said after his most recent acquisitions. &quot;Technology is the future and the more diversification the better.&quot;</p>
<p>His investment strategy is simple: buy sick companies, pump in new cash under strong management and help them recover or merge them with more successful businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got a rule of thumb: anything that's worth $4 billion and costs $1 billion -- buy it,&quot; he once said.</p>
<p>Waleed is the son of one of Saudi Arabia's so-called &quot;free princes&quot; who were exiled from the kingdom in the 1960s for calling the royal family undemocratic.</p>
<p>A grandson of Ibn Saudi, founding father of Saudi Arabia, he graduated with a degree in business administration from Menlo College, California in 1979 and received his master's degree from Syracuse University, New York in 1985.</p>
<p>His mother's father, Riadh al-Solh, was modern Lebanon's first prime minister.</p>
