<p>The Kenyan shilling was flat against the dollar and the pound on Monday in calm trade.</p>
<p>Commercial dealers said the shilling held Friday's levels amid lackluster trade. But they saw trade picking up on Tuesday when big investors were expected to emerge.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya posted a shilling mean rate of 56.43 against the dollar and an average of 87.77 against the pound, both unchanged from Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was generally very calm with large corporates having no large interest to either sell or buy,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The shilling opened and closed at the narrow band of 56.45/55 level,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>A trader said &quot;The demand for shillings should rise this week as corporates submit the third tranche of tax. We could see (the) shilling test new highs. The range for the day is 56.40/60.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said overnight money market rates were unchanged at the 22-24 levels, which were seen holding on Monday.</p>
