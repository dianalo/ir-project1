<p>Police stopped a small group of students from distributing condoms in St Peter's Square during Pope John Paul's address on Sunday to protest against the Catholic Church's ban on their use to stop the spread of AIDS.</p>
<p>Plainclothes Italian police told the some 15 students not to enter the square, which is on Vatican sovereign territory.</p>
<p>The students later distributed condoms and literature supporting their cause on Italian streets just outside the square.</p>
<p>Apparently worried by the media attention the group was receiving, the police later told them to move even farther away just before the Polish Pope began reading his weekly blessing and address from his window overlooking the square.</p>
<p>About a dozen uniformed police were called in to keep an eye on the students but there were no incidents. The students said they only wanted to carry out a symbolic action.</p>
<p>The students, most in their early 20s, were demonstrating in support of a controversial decision by students, teachers and parents of a secondary school in northern Turin to install a condom vending machine to help fight the spread of AIDS.</p>
<p>The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano and leading Catholic Church figures in Italy condemned the decision to eventually buy and install a machine in the school.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it is worrying to put faith before the lives of people,&quot; Maurizio Zamataro, a 22-year-old Roman university student who led the group, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is worrying that the Osservatore Romano and the Vatican do not allow an open, free discussion of the issue of AIDS and condoms,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church does not allow the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS.</p>
<p>It teaches that nothing should stop the possible transmission of life and asserts that the only way to stop the disease's spread is through responsible sexual behaviour -- such as no premarital sex and monogamy within heterosexual marriage.</p>
<p>The flyer the students handed out along with condoms read: &quot;Today, we are handing this out to you. Choose freely but let us be free (to choose).&quot;</p>
<p>It continued: &quot;Schools are precisely the places to teach what sex is, without moralism, and they must allow for access to instruments such as condoms that can save lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Valeria Valenti, a 20-year-old student from Naples who helped distrubute the condoms outside the square, said she was receiving mixed reactions from people.</p>
<p>&quot;The younger ones are accepting both the flyer and the condom. The middle aged ones are accepting only the flyer and the older ones are giving us dirty looks and not accepting either,&quot; she said.</p>
