<p>The European Commission is soon to draft new rules on airport take-off and landing slots but it could be at least 18 months before a new law takes effect, a senior aide to European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Philip Lowe, Kinnock's chief aid, told a conference on European air transport services that whatever rules were brought in they would not apply to the alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines which is currently being examined by the Commission under EU competition rules.</p>
<p>He hinted strongly that Kinnock's view was that slot trading should be made legal but warned that the issue was still being discussed as recent evidence from the United States indicated that it could lead to unfair competition.</p>
<p>&quot;After an extensive period of consultation of interested parties, the Commission is about to propose some improvement to this regulation (on slot allocation)&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;For those who think any of the changes can be of immediate application, I'm sorry to tell you that, though we are determined to push ahead with it, the process of getting this sort of EU legislation through...is a long one and it could take us at least 18 months before the revised regulation becomes law,&quot; Lowe said.</p>
<p>He therefore warned against &quot;mixing up&quot; the revision of the rules and how to solve the competition problems posed by the BA/American alliance.</p>
<p>Under 1993 EU legislation, slots can only be exchanged, but it is common practice to sell such rights especially at congested airports such as London-Heathrow for as much as one million pounds ($1.6 million) per unit.</p>
<p>A modification of the rules has become very topical in the light of a preliminary decision by the U.K.'s Office of Fair Trading in December to allow the link-up between BA and American on the condition they give away 168 weekly slots.</p>
<p>BA said it would only surrender the rights if allowed to sell them, but the Commission swiftly retorted that this would be illegal. European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert is especially opposed to legalising a secondary market for slots since they were originally given free by airport authorities.</p>
<p>Any future proposal allowing slot trading will have to be approved by EU transport ministers, a step which is not expected to be properly discussed before Britain assumes the presidency of the European Union in the first half of 1998.</p>
<p>The British government is a keen supporter of allowing airlines to sell slots, but it almost isolated, EU sources said.</p>
<p>Kinnock's services were also having second thoughts due to the U.S. experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Slot trading is allowed in the United States, but recent experience has shown it has contributed to reinforcing dominant positions,&quot; Lowe told Reuters later.</p>
<p>Lowe said that the revised rules would concentrate in making access to busy airports easier especialy for new market entrants.</p>
<p>&quot;The key issue is whether market allocation, through secondary trading, might achieve this without at the same time distorting competition,&quot; he said.</p>
