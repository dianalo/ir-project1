<headline>Austrian ATX extends bull run to fresh high.</headline>
<dateline>VIENNA 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Austria's ATX climbed 1.04 percent to a fresh record close on Wednesday, boosted by the strong dollar and a positive international environment.</p>
<p>Vienna airport company Flughafen Wien led the way on brisk turnover of 138,507 lots. Traders said its shares were benefitting from recent &quot;buy&quot; recommendations, surging 6.10 percent to 557 schillings.</p>
<p>&quot;The mood is right. There is lively interest for certain stocks and the 1,500-level is within reach for the ATX,&quot; one market participant said.</p>
<p>&quot;This market can run and run and run,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>The ATX index finished 15.14 points up at 1,474.01, having touched an intra-day high of 1,477.15. It was the ATX's highest close since the index was recalculated in January, 1991.</p>
<p>Overall 18 gainers outnumbered three losers.</p>
<p>Flughafen Wien was the top gainer, followed by preferred shares in bank Creditanstalt, up 4.08 percent at 606.70 schillings on heavy volume. Earlier Creditanstalt hit a new year high of 611 schillings.</p>
<p>Industrial group Radex-Heraklith, which presents its half-year earnings on Thursday firmed one schilling to 561.</p>
<p>The leading loser was paper maker Leykam, whose Dutch parent KNP BT also details half-year figures on Thursday. Leykam shares slipped 1.48 pct at 343.85 schillings.</p>
<p>August ATX futures stood 16.7 points up at 1,477.5 on 1,215 contracts. The broad-based Vienna bourse index rose 4.17 points, or 0.8 pct, to 525.85.</p>
