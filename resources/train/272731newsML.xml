<headline>IPE says may complete Nov gas oil probe in &quot;weeks&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) announced on Monday it was launching an inquiry into the November gas oil delivery, following a tussle between two top dealing houses that led to a sharp slowdown in Europe's main winter energy market.</p>
<p>A bluntly-worded IPE statement, described by traders as an act of unprecedented openness by the normally reticent exchange, said that serious questions had been raised about the extent to which the seller and buyer had complied with IPE regulations.</p>
<p>IPE chief executive Lynton Jones told Reuters, &quot;we are going to press forward as quickly as we can with the investigation and it's my expectation that it will be (completed in) weeks rather than months.&quot;</p>
<p>IPE directors said in a separate statement &quot;depending on the outcome of this investigation the IPE may commence disciplinary proceedings or take disciplinary action in respect of a member, or members of the Exchange.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders have said that Monte Carlo-based AIC and a Swiss unit of U.S.-based Cargill -- two big trading houses long known as rivals for supremacy in the trade in gas oil -- were involved in the bulk of a record high 865,100 tonne delivery due between November 16 and 30 on the Rotterdam barge market.</p>
<p>The two houses, whose confrontation was reported by other traders to have involved some $200 million worth of product, have each suggested that the other failed to comply with the provisions of the contract.</p>
<p>Jones said in a telephone interview he could not speculate on the size of any fine that would be levied in the event an infringement of the rules being found.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously it is in everybody's interest to get this done as soon as possible...We've got experience of having done these things before.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the extent of any punishment, he replied: &quot;It's impossible to say. We're not certain that there has been infringement of our rules. The scale of the offence, if proved, could range from minor to major. It's just not possible at this stage to speculate what the size of any fine would be.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the extent of the evidence supplied to the IPE, he replied: &quot;You can measure it by the tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't been sitting on our hands. We have been compiling the material. We have been checking it as we have been going along. But now we have got an instruction from the directors and we are looking at all that information in the light of that instruction&quot;.</p>
<p>Industry experts said the IPE statement appeared to reflect a concern by the exchange that it not merely act to police its own market -- something the exchange's officers insist they have done consistently -- but to be seen to be doing so in order to shore up confidence in the market.</p>
<p>The statement said the IPE directors had determined a price at which the quantity of gas oil to which each default relates shall be invoiced back, without reference to the fault of either the seller or the buyer.</p>
<p>Traders have said Cargill had established a large long position in November gas oil futures, betting that AIC, which has a large short position, would not be able to deliver into its commitments and therefore buy back its position at a higher price.</p>
<p>Traders said barge trade virtually stalled in late November because the play absorbed most barge capacity in ARA. The cargo market also shrank in part because companies not involved in the play prudently stayed on the sidelines.</p>
<p>The apparent squeeze was the latest in a series that had frightened many trading houses out of the gas oil futures market, a relatively small and specialised market now usually worked only by a dozen trading houses.</p>
<p>One trader said the latest play was typical of a trend towards aggressive and inflexible conduct in settling physical deliveries, with two or three companies battling for advantage compared to a more gentlemanly procedure involving many more companies in earlier years.</p>
