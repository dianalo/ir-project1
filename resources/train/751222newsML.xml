<p>Heavy flooding in southern China and severe drought in the north have spread infectious diseases and were threatening to cause epidemics, the China Daily said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Deteriorating environmental and living conditions in flooded and drought-hit areas posed a severe threat to the health of residents, it said quoting Health Minister Chen Minzhang.</p>
<p>Natural disasters that have struck China since early this year had spread hepatitis, typhoid and dysentery, and food and water-transmitted intestinal epidemics could occur at any time, he said.</p>
<p>People in disaster areas were living in the open or in makeshift shelters and the density of flies, mosquitoes and rats had risen, increasing the risk of exposure to infectious disease, he said.</p>
<p>Chen urged local governments to prepare for more disasters and to step up epidemic prevention, adding that the drought in the north had not yet ended and southern China had just entered the typhoon season.</p>
<p>Cases of infectious disease rose by 7.7 percent and the mortality rate was up 14.9 percent this year, the China Daily said quoting statistics from the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Officials and state media have reported at least 274 deaths from recent floods in eastern and southern China with millions left homeless.</p>
<p>While floods have wreaked havoc in the south, drought and high temperatures have plagued northern China.</p>
