<headline>CME hog calls mixed, pork bellies higher.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-16</dateline>

<p>Early calls on CME hog futures ranged from 0.150 cent per lb lower to 0.150 higher while pork bellies were called 0.250 to 1.000 cent higher, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Carryover technical pressure and selling prompted by steady to lower cash hog calls were expected to pressure hog futures initially. Further fund liquidation is likely after futures fell to a one month low and touched off sell stops when they went through support at 82.700 cents Thursday. The cut in packer kill rates started the break in futures Wednesday, analysts said.</p>
<p>However, some analyts look for support to develop quickly based on the large discount of futures to the latest CME lean index. The latest index rose $1.38 to $83.88 per cwt, well above June close on Thursday of 82.325. Pork cutout values were also up which may stimulate increased packer interest for hogs, they added.  </p>
<p>Carryover demand from Thursday's limit gains and a strong technical picture, as well as firmer fundamentals, were expected to lift pork belly futures at the start. Futures rose to a one week high in July when it went through the 20-day average at about 90.500 and a trend line at 91.500 on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>A light slaughter pace and the jump in cash belly prices were cited as strong fundamental factors. Export interest for pork bellies has been fairly good and expectations on next week's Cold Storage report point to a possible reduction in U.S. warehouse stocks during April, they said.</p>
<p>Early indications on the report range from 52.2 to 59 million lbs on hand May 1 compared with 54.8 million on hand April 1 and 57.2 million in storage May 1 of last year.</p>
