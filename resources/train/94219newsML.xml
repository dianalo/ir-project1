<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch to shut nuclear power station early.</title>
<headline>Dutch to shut nuclear power station early.</headline>

<p>Dutch withdrawal from nuclear enery gained pace on Thursday with a decision to close a small experimental station seven years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dodewaard power station will definitely cease producing electricity in the short term...probably in March 1997,&quot; the power generating industry umbrella group Samenwerkende elektriciteits-produktiebedrijven (Sep) said in a statement.</p>
<p>The decision to close the 58 mega-watt (MW) plant early is the result of the Dutch government's reluctance to guarantee a future for the nuclear sector, a Sep spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is providing no positive signals for the (nuclear) industry at the moment,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Lukewarm signals from The Hague, much of it in response to public pressure after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, have blocked the progress of the nuclear production industry.</p>
<p>In 1994, Dutch members of parliamnent voted to close the 449 Megawatt (MW) Borssele plant in the southern Netherlands in 2004. Analysts predicted then a greater shift in the Dutch energy balance towards gas power stations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the 1,675 MW gas-fired Eemshaven power station started up and further such plants are due to begin operating before the end of the century.</p>
<p>Late last year in its Third Energy Note, the Dutch government said it wanted to maintain its knowledge of nuclear power production, but had no plans to build new plants.</p>
<p>&quot;Since we have no real solution for safety and nuclear disposal, there is no reason for making plans for building nuclear plants,&quot; a spokeswoman for the ministry of economic affairs said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Environmental group Greenpeace welcomed the shutdown and called for the early closure of Borssele too.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows there is no future for nuclear energy (in the Netherlands),&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Borssele is producing well and at low cost and there's no reason to close it (early),&quot; the Sep spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Sep-operated Dodewaard, near the German border, started up in 1969 to provide the Dutch with experience of the nuclear industry. Borssele came into operation four years later and remains the country's sole commercial plant.</p>
<p>Nuclear power supplies about seven percent of Dutch electricity needs.</p>
