<p>Egyptian share prices rose half a percent in busy trade on Wednesday and brokers said the new dealing system was gradually giving them less trouble.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index rose 1.18 points to close at 234.92 points on very high turnover of 109.23 million pounds ($32.1 million).</p>
<p>Arab Cotton Ginning, majority privatised in mid-September, made a strong debut on the exchange at 32.00 pounds, five pounds up on the IPO price of 27.00. More than 370,000 shares changed hands, about 16 percent of the company.</p>
<p>Extra volume also came from registration of 10 percent of Arab Drugs and Chemical Industries, sold to employees as part of the privatisation programme. The 120,000 shares went through at the IPO price of 40.00 and have not yet traded.</p>
<p>Three recently privatised milling shares were also features of the day, active and rising in unison. Central and West Delta Flour Mills rose 1.50 to 50.50 pounds, Upper Egypt Flour Mills was up 0.88 to 47.70 and North Cairo Flour Mills added 2.00 to close at 114.00.</p>
<p>But the most active cement shares fell back, Amreya Cement by 0.43 to 57.52 and Helwan Portland Cement by 0.70 to 47.90 pounds.</p>
<p>Neveen El Tahry of EAB Delta Stockbrokers said that after days of teething problems with a new dealing system designed to tighten up the schedule for settlement and payment, brokers were becoming familiar with the new procedures.</p>
<p>&quot;With the new system everything has to be in order before you deal. It's much more complicated,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The target is to complete all the paperwork within 48 hours of a transaction on the exchange.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms rose to 364.37 from 360.62 points on Tuesday while the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 162.23 points from 161.93.</p>
<p>Gaining stocks outnumbered decliners by 25 to 22.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.40 pounds</p>
