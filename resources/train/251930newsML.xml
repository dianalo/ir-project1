<p>Brazilian stocks shrugged off positive news on the telecom front and closed off 0.3 percent, weighed down again by volatile Wall Street and speculation ahead of next Monday's options settlement, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index  .BVSP of the 49 most traded shares fell 203 points to close off at 66,575 points.  Volume was high at 404.6 million reais ($389.2 million).</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. markets led foreign bourses to another session of losses and Brazil was not an exception,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Traders said market nervousness caused by fears of a rise in U.S. interest rates led local investors to put aside a much-awaited general telecommunications law, sent to Congress' lower house earlier today, authorizing the restructuring and the sell-off of the federal Telebras system.</p>
<p>The bill also outlines the creation of a regulatory body, to be linked to the Communications Ministry, which would set rate policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The delivery of the law to Congress was good news, but nobody really paid attention to this today with weakness overseas,&quot; said another trader.  </p>
<p>Telebras preferred closed off 0.65 percent to 76.10 reais, while its common stock fell 2.71 percent to 68.20 reais.</p>
<p>Among other blue-chips, state oil firm Petrobras a hike in fuel prices.</p>
<p>State mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce ended flat at 20.70 reais, while state power utility Eletrobras also ended flat at 360 reais.</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's power sector index  .IEE, comprising the nine most liquid stocks of the electrical sector, ended up 0.82 percent to 1,845 points.  </p>
<p>Analysts said shares could weaken again on Friday, although a rebound is expected at the market's open after the last two days of losses.</p>
<p>They also said they would keep an eye on trade in BCN stock, which will resume tomorrow after the bank acknowledged it was holding talks to sell a majority stake to Banco BBA Creditanstalt but denied it had already sold such a stake to the bank.</p>
<p>Trade was suspended today following news reports that the acquisition of BCN by BBA was imminent.</p>
