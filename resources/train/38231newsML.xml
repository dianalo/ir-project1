<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said on Friday she wanted compensation from the United States for losses incurred by her country's backing for the allied effort against Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;It's about time the United States proved they also stand by Turkey -- these losses have to be compensated,&quot; Ciller told BBC World television. &quot;We only want a certain portion of our losses to be compensated economically.&quot;</p>
<p>Ciller said Turkey was working with U.S. officials on &quot;the economic losses ... and how that can be compensated&quot;.</p>
<p>Turning to the security zone Turkey plans to create in northern Iraq, Ciller said it was a &quot;must&quot; for Turkey following the recent upheaval in northern Iraq. Turkey would &quot;definitely&quot; observe the territorial integrity of Iraq, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the buffer zone) is not taking advantage of anything and if it is seen as such it will be the worst mistake that anyone can make,&quot; Ciller said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the zone) means a fence strip right next to our borders has to be looked at as a security area which will deter penetration. It is going to be temporary kind of activity.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, Turkey spelled out limited military goals inside northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Asked about plans for cross-border operations, Ahmet Erturk, deputy governor of the southeastern provinces, told reporters: &quot;There is nothing happening. The journalists have gone there for nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>At midnight on Thursday, Iraq summoned a senior Turkish diplomat in Baghdad to complain about Ankara's military build-up at the border with Kurdish-held northern Iraq.</p>
<p>A Turkish foreign ministry official told Reuters on Friday: &quot;A permanent Turkish military existence across the border is out of the question.&quot;</p>
