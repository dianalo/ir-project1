<title>BRAZIL: Brazil farm debt paper to be renegotiated.</title>
<headline>Brazil farm debt paper to be renegotiated.</headline>
<dateline>BRASILIA 1996-11-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>A decree signed by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso allows holders of some $1.6 billion in special farm debt paper to switch them for other Treasury debt, the Finance Ministry said.</p>
<p>The ministry said in a statement that the government would pay the equivalent of 10 percent of the face value of so-called Agrarian Debt Paper (TDA) and the remaining 90 percent would be swapped for new TDAs issued by the Treasury.</p>
<p>The deal, contained in a decree hiking taxes on unproductive farm land, applies to TDA's issued by the government's land reform agency INCRA up to June 22, 1992.  </p>
<p>The switch to Treasury TDAs, known as TDA-E, will be carried out in five annual stages, with a two-year grace period on principle and interest of six percent a year plus the Reference Rate (TR).</p>
<p>&quot;The substitution of these papers will be voluntary,&quot; the ministry said.  &quot;With this, the government hopes to settle the question of an estimated 1.6 billion real debt.&quot;</p>
<p>The terms apply to TDAs whose maturity has expired. These trade illiquidly with up to a 60 percent discount.  TDAs which have still to mature can also be switched but the 10 percent cash payment will take place a month after the maturity date.  </p>
<p>TDA's were used to pay for disappropriated land.  Since June 24, 1992, the Treasury has assumed responsibility for the process and issued TDA-Es.</p>
<p>The decree signed Tuesday by Cardoso is designed to speed up the process of land reform in Brazil, one of the most pressing social issues in the country.</p>
<p>It raises taxes on unproductive land to as much as 20 percent of its value and allows the government to seize the land if the owners do not pay the tax for five years.</p>
