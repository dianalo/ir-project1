<p>Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Thursday conditionally withdrew a threat to sack reformist Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, saying that &quot;as long as reforms continue, the premier will retain his post&quot;.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev, who threatened last week to remove Kazhegeldin if he did not rectify problems over huge arrears on state salaries and pensions by April 10, told Russia's Interfax news agency that the premier was &quot;a creative man with a potential, who boldly pursues reforms&quot;.</p>
<p>The threat had caused jitters among current and potential investors in the oil-rich Central Asian state.News of a possible ousture of Kazhegeldin, 45, a successful businessman before his 1994 appointment as prime minister, created jitters among current and potential foreign investors in in the oil-rich Central Asian state.</p>
<p>Many of the investors, who view Kazhegeldin, 45, as the country's main guarantor of market reforms, have said the premier's plan to sell off national oil companies could be the reason for the recent talk of his removal. Kazhegeldin was a successful businessman before being named prime minister in 1994.</p>
<p>Oil and Gaz Minister Nurlan Balgimabayev, the main opponent of Kazhegeldin's privatisation plans, has recently been appointed to head the new Kazakh Oil state company, which will hold a 40 to 50 percent stake in all joint ventures with Western oil firms developing Kazakhstan's oil riches.</p>
<p>Apart from rejecting rumours about Kazhegeldin's eventual departure, Nazarbayev told Interfax &quot;there could be still some changes in the government&quot;.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan's former Communist party boss who holds sweeping powers, recently decreed a reduction in the number of government ministries and departments to 25 from 47.</p>
<p>Official newspapers said the move would save the government money and fight bureaucracy, while independent experts said it was more likely only to strengthen Nazarbayev's personal power.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev told Interfax that seven institutions, including the ministries of foreign affairs and defence, agencies for strategic planning and for control over strategic resources and some others would now directly report to him.</p>
