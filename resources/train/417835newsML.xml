<p>Oil refiners on the U.S. West Coast are expected to source more of their crude oil from overseas this year, adding to a trend which saw a 15 percent rise in imports last year, analysts said.</p>
<p>Tosco's bigger buyer-clout when it completes the acquisition of three more West Coast refineries this year, as well as declining domestic oil production and last year's lifting of the export ban on Alaskan crude, all are expected to be factors in bumping up the import tally.  </p>
<p>Crude oil imports into the West Coast totaled 120.5 million barrels for the first 11 months of 1996, up 16 million (or a little more than 15 percent) from the same period in 1995, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Most of the crude came from Canada, Ecuador and Oman.</p>
<p>Local refiners, accustomed to cheap supplies from Alaska and California, have been buying more foreign crudes to contain the price of shrinking local supplies.  </p>
<p>&quot;When you were able to buy crude relatively cheaply...you only rarely went looking for something else,&quot; said Raoul LeBlanc, an Energy Security Analysis Inc analyst in Washington DC. &quot;There may be value in looking (overseas) more often.&quot;</p>
<p>Outright demand on the West Coast is forecast to increase only marginally in 1997, but Asian markets are expected to see substantial jumps in demand over the next decade.</p>
<p>British Petroleum,a leading producer of mainstay West Coast crude Alaska North Slope (ANS), began late last year to test the potentially huge market by shipping small amounts of ANS to Taiwan and Korea on an experimental basis.  </p>
<p>While these exports have not been a large diversion from the traditional California market, they could be used by BP as a mechanism to relieve any downward pressure on prices in the region and to force refiners to outbid Far East refiners, according to LeBlanc.</p>
<p>BP and others point out that refiners in California and Washington will remain the preferred ANS customers.</p>
<p>&quot;California is still the sensible market. (ANS) is not leaving here and forcing huge imports,&quot; said Ken Haley, manager of energy forecasting at Chevron Corp. &quot;It all comes down to price and negotiations,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>But the balance of bargaining power could tilt in favor of refiners once Tosco Corp, takes over three California refineries from Unocal Corp later this quarter.</p>
<p>Tosco, known for reviving dead refineries through hard bargaining and cost-cutting, is expected to wield much power in western spot crude markets, industry observers say.</p>
<p>Tosco has so far avoided long-term contracts for foreign oil. But with the additional three plants running a total 250,000 bpd of crude, Tosco's West Coast throughput capacity will rise to about 500,000 bpd, putting it just behind regional market leader Chevron.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're not just going sit there and run ANS all the time,&quot; said a Tosco trader. &quot;We're a big proponent of bringing (foreigns) in.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, the company imported about 20 million barrels into the West Coast, the area's third highest importer, according to statistics from the American Petroleum Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;At $1.00 off, a lot of others are looking to bring (foreign crude) in,&quot; he said, referring to the ANS's current $1.00 discount to West Texas Intermediate crude, the tightest relative price for ANS since early 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question that with Tosco's trading ability they could decide to do something,&quot; said Buck Petersen, a independent consultant based in California.</p>
