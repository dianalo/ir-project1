<headline>NZ's Peters says Coalition will be fiscally tight.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Treasurer Winston Peters said on Friday in one of his first major speeches since his appointment last month that the new New Zealand coalition government would be fiscally &quot;tight&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The previous government had a reputation for being tight... I can assure bureaucrats the Coalition Government will be even tighter,&quot; he said in a speech to the opening of a hospital in Tauranga.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is a fundamental Coalition principle that an economic climate to foster growth can only be achieved through low inflation and prudent and conservative management of the government's coffers,&quot; Peters said.</p>
<p>&quot;Over time this will lead to further tax cuts and reduced public debt.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;I shrink from the word austere, but the Coalition Government will be a stern guardian of the taxpayers' dollar,&quot; Peters said.</p>
<p>Duplication of government services would end.</p>
<p>Peters' nationalist New Zealand First Party joined with the conservative National Party to form a centre-right government last month.</p>
<p>Peters said health, the economy and education were identified during the October election as people's biggest worries.  </p>
<p>He said the words &quot;public service&quot; would be put back into the vocabulary of health managers and the health system.</p>
<p>There would be a boost to health spending of up to $378 million in the next financial year, which would be directed towards &quot;areas in the public health system in dire need of more resources&quot;. But Peters said that, as Treasurer, he would rigorously scrutinise how extra taxpayers' money would be spent on public health.</p>
<p>&quot;There has never been any mandate for wastage and profligacy.&quot; -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746</p>
