<p>The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said on Sunday that some 350,000 Rwandan refugees had returned to Rwanda from eastern Zaire since Friday and a further 150,000 were on the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is a rough estimate, but we now estimate 350,000 have crossed since the mass movement started and perhaps up to another 100-150,000 left on the other side are on their way,&quot; UNHCR spokesman Mans Nyberg told Reuters.</p>
<p>But Nyberg said there were still about 215,000 refugees unaccounted for in Zaire and aid organisations had no word of their fate.</p>
<p>In the Zairean town of Goma across the border, UNHCR official Ray Wilkinson said his organisation had brought in more than 50 buses and trucks from Gisenyi to Goma to help in picking up the remaining refugees.</p>
<p>Nyberg said a UNHCR field team confirmed on Sunday that the road from the Zairean border town of Bukavu to Sake, just west of the once-teeming Mugunga camp from where the latest exodus started, was now virtually empty.</p>
<p>Some 500,000 other refugees are believed to be in the south Kivu area, which includes Bukavu some 100 km (60 miles) away. Nyberg said any refugees from there crossing at Gisenyi appeared to be isolated cases.</p>
<p>The mass exodus began suddenly on Friday when an alliance of Zairean rebels forced feared Hutu militiamen, who had been preventing the refugees from leaving, to flee the teeming camps they had ruthlessly controlled since 1994.</p>
<p>The militia and former Hutu government troops had spearheaded the genocide of some one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994, before being driven out by Tutsi rebels who went on to establish a new government in the Rwandan capital Kigali.</p>
