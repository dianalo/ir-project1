<title>UK: Safeway sales growth slows, wary on profits.</title>
<headline>Safeway sales growth slows, wary on profits.</headline>

<p>British supermarket retailer Safeway Plc said on Friday that same store sales in the five weeks to January 4 were up 5.2 percent but that over the first 16 weeks of the second half growth slowed to a 4.5 percent rise.</p>
<p>The store chain, which holds a 7.8 percent share of Britain's grocery market, said if the slowdown in sales continued, &quot;profits for the remaining eight weeks of the current year might be affected.&quot;  </p>
<p>Safeway, which ranks third to market leader Tesco Plc and J. Sainsbury Plc, said slipping inflation, which fell in the early weeks of the new year from a slim 1.1 percent gain in the five weeks to January 4, could also be a factor.</p>
<p>Safeway said that volume growth achieved was strong and its marketing and customer service continued to be successful, adding it was confident it could deliver &quot;a further year of solid profit growth.&quot;</p>
<p>Safeway's statement comes just a week after Sainsbury shocked the market when it said investment to boost sales, which gained to a 4.4 percent rise over the key Christmas trading period, would hurt profits.</p>
<p>Tesco, which pipped Sainsbury off the top slot just over a year ago as it launched a loyalty card, managed to maintain sales growth at 7.5 percent over the Christmas period, while the fourth largest chain, ASDA does not report on trading.</p>
