<headline>U.S. legislators against extending check clearing.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-24</dateline>

<p>Leading members of Congress said Friday they would oppose a legislative proposal from the Federal Reserve to let banks hold local checks for an additional day.</p>
<p>Consumer groups were up in arms over the plan to amend the Expedited Funds Availability Act to permit banks to hold consumer deposits for three days instead of two as currently allowed.</p>
<p>There is &quot;little prospect for Congressional action,&quot; House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach said.</p>
<p>&quot;The additional day will have minimal impact on forgeries, the largest portion of check fraud,&quot; Leach said. &quot;By holding to the two-day limit, Congress encourages the advancement of check clearing technology while giving working families earlier access to their much needed resources.&quot;</p>
<p>The ranking Democrat on the panel, Representative Henry Gonzalez of Texas, said he and New York Representative Carolyn Maloney have written a letter signed by 28 other legislators opposing the Fed's request, &quot;which would have done nothing but harm consumers,&quot; Gonzalez said.</p>
<p>Banks would have collected millions of dollars in additional interest by holding the funds for an additional day, consumer groups said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully with Mr. Leach's help this law will not be in jeopardy,&quot; Michelle Meier, counsel for Consumers Union said. &quot;There's no reason why consumers should have to wait to get access to their money beyond the two days.&quot;</p>
