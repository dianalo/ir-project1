<p>Australian Open finalist Carlos Moya overpowered Hendrik Dreekman in straight sets to give Spain an unbeatable 3-1 lead over Germany in their Davis Cup world group first round tie on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;I had to put up with a lot of pressure, I was playing at home...and I'd got to the final in the Australia Open, so winning makes me especially happy,&quot; said Moya, who ran out a 6-4 6-4 7-5 winner in just over two hours.</p>
<p>Moya broke Dreekman's serve in the opening game of the first set and served out to take the set.</p>
<p>He started the second set in similar fashion but Dreekman broke back immediatelyand saw a lob that would have given him a further break drift centimetres out with the Spaniard stranded.</p>
<p>Moya survived the scare and won the game with a superb backhand crosscourt pass before breaking serve again at 3-3.</p>
<p>Games went with serve in the third set before Moya apeared to suffer an attack of nerves after breaking Dreekman and serving for the match at 5-4. He broke Dreekman again in the 11th game and recovered from love-30 to clinch the match and the tie.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very confident from the start. I never thought I'd lose, even when I let it slip at 5-4 in the third,&quot; said Moya, who lost to world number one Pete Sampras in the final of Australian Open last month.</p>
<p>Coach Manolo Santana praised Moya -- whom he described as a &quot;born Davis Cup player&quot; -- in an emotional post-match press conference during which he embraced the Spanish number one.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a special chemistry between the players, the crowd and the coaching staff, and it shows in the way we play,&quot; said Santana.</p>
<p>Albert Costa and Marc Goellner were meeting in the final dead rubber.</p>
