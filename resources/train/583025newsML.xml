<p>Whether the right or the left wins France's parliamentary election, voters do not believe they will end up with the prime minister they want, according to a Sofres poll for the weekly Pelerin magazine released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the event of a centre-right victory, the poll found that 26 percent wanted National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin and 21 percent former premier Edouard Balladur as head of government compared with only eight percent for Prime Minister Alain Juppe.</p>
<p>But, asked who they thought had the best chance of getting the job, 26 percent said Juppe, 19 percent Seguin and 22 percent Balladur.</p>
<p>In the event of a left-wing opposition victory, 44 percent said they wanted former European Commission president Jacques Delors as prime minister to 18 percent for Socialist Party head Lionel Jospin.</p>
<p>But asked who had the best chance of becoming prime minister, 57 percent said Jospin and 23 percent Delors.</p>
<p>&quot;The French people have no illusions. Whether the right or the left wins, they believe they will not end up with the prime minister of their choice,&quot; Pelerin said of the Sofres findings.</p>
<p>A second Sofres poll found that 90 percent of French adults were open to a woman prime minister. Just nine percent said they would oppose a woman as head of government while one percent had no opinion.</p>
<p>Both polls relied on interviews with 1,000 people aged 18 and over, conducted last Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>An IPSOS poll for the weekly Le Point found Juppe growing in popularity as the campaign progressed, along with fellow Gaullist and President Jacques Chirac, and Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin.</p>
<p>It found 39 percent of adults held a favourable opinion of Juppe, an increase of 10 points over a similar poll conducted a month ago. Seguin was viewed favourably by 53 percent while 50 percent approved of Balladur, the poll found.</p>
<p>Chirac's popularity rose to 46 percent in the latest IPSOS survey from 37 percent the previous month, IPSOS said, while Jospin was viewed favourably by 49 percent of adults, a rise of 21 percentage points over the month.</p>
<p>The IPSOS survey relied on interviews with 980 individuals aged 18 and over, conducted last Friday and Saturday.</p>
