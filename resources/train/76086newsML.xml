<p>Financial institutions have come out in strong support for the private placement of shares by Cape-based LA Clothing (Pty) Ltd prior to its listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) on October 14.</p>
<p>Chief executive Abdul Peer told reporters on Wednesday the placement to raise 10.5 million rand had been supported by Sanlam, The Southern Life Association Ltd , Board of Executors, Investec Ltd , Standard Corporate and Merchant Bank and Brimstone.</p>
<p>&quot;Five out of the six said they would love to get more shares,&quot; Peer said, adding that a planned 10-for-one share split would improve the tradeability of shares.</p>
<p>The group will be listed on the JSE through the reverse take-over of Ensign Ltd , a cash shell, which will be shifted to the industrial stores sector and renamed LA Retail Stores Ltd.</p>
<p>Peer and his family will own 70 percent of the &quot;new&quot; company, institutions 24 percent and Ensign minorities the remaining six percent.</p>
<p>In its prospectus, LA Clothing said turnover was expected to grow to 44 million rand by August 1997 compared to 34 million rand in the year to August 31, 1996 with earnings per share rising to 19.2 cents compared to 15.4 cents.</p>
<p>It has predicted a dividend of 6.27 cents this year.</p>
<p>&quot;By utilising the cash resources acquired from the takeover of Ensign, future growth will be derived from opening new stores countrywide, expanding our credit base, franchising, exports and creating new retail formats,&quot; Peer said.</p>
<p>Geared mainly towards the teenage fashion market, LA Clothing has not yet been unduly affected by illegal clothing imports but Peer said he would welcome any attempt by the government to tighten controls over these imports.</p>
<p>He said he was considering the possibility of resuscitating Ensign brands such as Samson.</p>
