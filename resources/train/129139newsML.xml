<p>Singapore, already suffering from a slowdown in exports, reported on Sunday that its retail sector was hit by a decline in August.</p>
<p>Retail sales fell both on a year-to-year and a month-to-month basis, the Statistics Department said.</p>
<p>The August retail sales index (base 1991) declined 4.0 percent in current prices compared to a year ago, and dropped 5.4 percent from July 1996.</p>
<p>Excluding motor vehicles, the index registered a month-on-month fall of 7.1 percent in August.</p>
<p>The Statistics Department said one factor in the month-on-month fall was a spending decline after the end of a major annual country-wide sale.</p>
<p>Last month the department had reported the July retail sales index rose 3.5 percent compared to a year earlier.</p>
<p>Economists have been expressing concern over a slowdown in Singapore's growth. The island republic's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a healthy 10.9 percent year-on-year in the first quarter and 7.0 percent in the second.</p>
<p>But alarm bells began ringing in July when the government announced the city-state's non-oil exports had fallen by 6.1 percent year-on-year in nominal terms in June. After a rebound in July, exports slumped another 6.3 percent in August.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of 12 economists, carried out at the end of last week, predicted Singapore's GDP would grow by just 6.5 percent this year, compared with 8.8 percent in 1995 and 10.2 percent in 1994.</p>
