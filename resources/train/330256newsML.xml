<p>News that Mexico's two largest banks have written off a huge chunk of their mortgage loan portfolios sent shock waves through the already fragile Mexican banking industry on Friday.</p>
<p>Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci) and rival Grupo Financiero Bancomer each recently sold a whopping 12 billion pesos of past-due mortgage loans, the National Banking and Securities Commission said late on Thursday. In the case of Banamex, it was 22 percent of its entire mortgage portfolio.  </p>
<p>Two smaller banks, Grupo Financiero Bital and Grupo Financiero Atlantico, also sold bad mortgage loans to the government's Fobaproa bank-support fund, although it did not disclose the amount.</p>
<p>The amount of money involved stunned some industry analysts, who nevertheless welcomed the moves as giving the clearest picture to date of the deep cracks in the banking system caused by the 1994-95 peso crisis.  </p>
<p>&quot;People were shocked at both the program itself and the extent of the problem...but the program overall is a good thing because it recognizes the problem,&quot; said Andrew Collins, a bank analyst at Credit Lyonnais.</p>
<p>The banks took advantage of a government offer to include mortgage loans in Fobaproa before January 1, when new accounting rules adopted by Mexico would nearly double the amount of mortgage loans considered past-due on the banks' balance sheet.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the new rules, the banks are not better or worse off than they were before, but this shows the extent of the damage caused by the crisis,&quot; said Alberto Camacho, a bank analyst at ABM Amro in New York.</p>
<p>To date, the government has bought about 143 billion pesos of bad debt from banks -- a bailout bill that taxpayers are likely to foot in the end.</p>
<p>In this case, banks sold their bad mortgage loans to the government at a 35 percent discount, receiving in return 91-day Cetes, or T-bills, that pay lower, but guaranteed, interest.  </p>
<p>In doing this, Banamex took a charge of 4.3 billion pesos directly to equity and not on the profit-and-loss statement. Despite the charge, Banamex's ratio of capital to risk assets (capitalization) is still a healthy 13 percent, analysts said.</p>
<p>The banks also pledged to raise half the amount of loans they sold in fresh capital to further strengthen their balance sheets. Bancomer and Banamex have until the end of the year each to raise 4 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Banamex had already sold 15 billion in loans to Fobaproa and in return pledged to raise 8.54 billion in fresh capital last year. It completed that capitalization in December.  </p>
<p>Some analysts said the program gives the banks fresh capital to make new loans amid an economic recovery that could increase profitability, although others said lower interest on government securities could squeeze interest margins.</p>
<p>Others said the new rules would do little to help banks coax customers into paying back their loans and may even hurt repayment if people thought the government would not risk political damage by repossesing homes and other assets.</p>
<p>Underneath all the noise about accounting changes, Mexico's banking business remains sick, analysts said.</p>
<p>Banamex's 1996 net profits were 1.452 billion pesos, some 33 percent lower than a year ago. Its 12-month operating profit fell 18 percent to 2.27 billion pesos compared with 1995 profit.</p>
<p>But before taxes and excluding subsidiaries, Banamex broke even for the year, and the bank's interest margins also fell to 4.3 percent during the fourth quarter from 5.1 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Bank officials on Friday said they expected the bank's interest margins to erode another 100 basis points this year.</p>
