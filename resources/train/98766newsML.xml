<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe defended Sunday the government's economic record, saying the pace of French economic growth would be twice as fast next year 1996 allowing more than 100,000 jobs to be created.</p>
<p>In a television interview on TF1, Juppe said, &quot;Everyone is saying the same thing, growth will be twice as fast 1997 than in 1996,&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether growth would be two or 2.3 percent next year, Juppe replied, &quot;Everyone says a minumum two and the consensus is for around 2.3.&quot;</p>
<p>The official government forecast for growth in 1996 is 1.3 percent and is 2.3 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to the measures we've taken, with growth of more than two percent we will create more than 100,000 jobs,&quot; Juppe said.</p>
<p>French unemployment leapt to a record in August with the biggest monthly increase in more than three years pushing the jobless rate to 12.6 percent.</p>
<p>He said, however, the unemployment rate was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and it was true the government had not yet achieved its objectives in that area.</p>
