<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 29 --------------</p>
<p>+ Brent may seek lower numbers on Thursday but the market will find a number of good support levels from $19 downwards.</p>
<p>+ U.S. markets are looking weak and this may provide a downwards bias this afternoon.</p>
<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures appear to be in a downwards corrective phase from this month's up move and the market is expected to move sideways or even a little lower still, but it is well supported at and below $19.00.</p>
<p>July IPE Brent closed just two cents a barrel firmer on Wednesday at $19.24, while June gas oil ended a dollar up at $173.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;The market needed a correction and that is what we have seen,&quot; said Darren Gurner at Sucden in London. &quot;But there is a pretty good band of support at $19.00 and below.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that $19.00 on the July contract chart was an important hurdle as a psychological level.</p>
<p>This is also the top of a gap on the front-month continuation chart dating from three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Beneath this number, Gurner added, lies a gap on the July chart at $18.80-$18.88, and then the 40-day moving average which currently weighs in at $18.78.</p>
<p>&quot;If we break below that the market might start to look a little dodgy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Resistance would also be found at $19.88-$19.93, a chart gap from the weekend.</p>
<p>Fenella Graham at MeesPierson Derivatives said she saw a tight range for Brent between $19.12 and $19.32 on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking to trade the range but the U.S. has a slightly negative bias so we will wait for rallies to sell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will look for $19.48 to sell, or at best $19.64,&quot; she added, employing her company's Market Profile chart technique.</p>
