<p>A transcript of a TV interview given by German soccer federation (DFB) president Egidius Braun proved that his remarks about sharing the staging of the 2006 World Cup with England were misunderstood, a DFB spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>The DFB denied that Braun had offered in a television interview to share the staging of the 2006 World Cup finals with England.</p>
<p>Michael Novak, spokesman for the DFB, said that Braun had said nothing about sharing during an interview with ARD television on Sunday night.</p>
<p>He said a report circulating in the British media on Monday that Braun had made such an offer was the result of a journalist's incorrect interpretation of Braun's remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a misunderstanding of what Braun said,&quot; said Novak.</p>
<p>&quot;At no point during the (ARD) interview was the subject of sharing the finals even brought up.&quot;</p>
<p>According to a transcript of the interview, Braun was asked if UEFA had already made a decision to back the German bid.</p>
<p>&quot;UEFA had always assumed that Germany would be the only (European) country bidding and had always said 'We support Germany',&quot; Braun replied.</p>
<p>&quot;But after the European championship the English came. And I said to Franz Beckenbauer on January 14 'It is time that we talk with England about whether we can have one European (bid) or whether we should not have a split (bid).&quot;</p>
<p>Novak said the word &quot;split&quot; that Braun was referring was whether Europe would have one country bidding or two, and not whether Germany and England would share a joint bid.</p>
<p>&quot;There was never any suggestion that he was talking about sharing the World Cup,&quot; Novak said. &quot;It was clear that he was talking about a split in bidding for the Cup, not in sharing it.&quot;</p>
<p>Other countries besides England and Germany are also expected to bid for the finals in nine years time, including Australia, South Africa, Morocco and a possible joint-venture from Argentina and Brazil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile FIFA, world soccer's governing body, who are not directly concerned with the bidding proposals at this early stage, said on Monday they would not sanction any joint-bid for the finals.</p>
<p>Spokesman Keith Cooper said: &quot;If a joint-bid was put forward it would not gain approval because FIFA decided that after awarding the 2002 finals jointly to Japan and Korea that the subsequent finals would revert to being played in one country.</p>
<p>&quot;The finals in 2002 were awarded to two countries because of exceptional circumstances and because of the problems involved it was decided by the executive committee that they would be a one-off.&quot;</p>
<p>The German soccer squad left for Israel earlier on Monday for a friendly match in Tel Aviv on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Alec McGivan, the director of England's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup finals, had reacted coolly to the initial report in the British media on Monday.</p>
<p>McGivan said on BBC Radio: &quot;If our colleagues at the German F.A. come to us with some form of proposals or plan, we would have the courtesy to discuss it with them. I don't think we can say no to anything straight away.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have a very strong bid on our own which can stand up on its own. For us, the only option under consideration is our own bid and that is not going to change in the near future.&quot;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago McGivan told Reuters that the possibility of England and Germany co-hosting the finals was slight, explaining: &quot;I'm sure that if the bids from England and Germany were so strong that no one could choose between them then it might be a possibility.</p>
<p>&quot;But so much would have to happen before that ever became a reality I can't see it materialising.&quot;</p>
<p>McGivan said on Monday: &quot;There's quite a debate going on about whether this tournament will be in Europe or not. The South Americans feel they have a strong case to make as well, so we shouldn't assume this tournament will be in Europe although tradition would have it that it probably will be.&quot;</p>
<p>Both Germany and England are to push their individual claims when UEFA's Executive Committee meets in Geneva on April 17.</p>
<p>UEFA will only back one bid, and a public row blew up earlier this month when it appeared that UEFA had given their backing to Germany without any prior consultation.</p>
<p>That situation changed following a protest from the English F.A. who believe their hand has been strengthened by growing animosity towards a possible German bid from German pressure groups.</p>
