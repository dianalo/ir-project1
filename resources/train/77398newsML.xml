<p>Poland offered Adtranz, a joint venture of ABB group and Daimler-Benz AG a tentative deal on the sale of rolling-stock maker Pafawag, with a final contract likely in two or three months, Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kaczmarek told a news conference a tentative agreement would give state railways PKP sufficient time to declare whether it would buy equipment from Pafawag.</p>
<p>&quot;We can sign a tentative agreement stipulating that the two sides agree to finalise the transaction in two to three months. This time would be required to hear a clear declaration on PKP's behalf...&quot; Kaczmarek said.</p>
<p>For Adtranz, which has been in talks on Pafawag acquisition for years, guarantees of PKP purchases are the key condition for its investment.</p>
<p>Kaczmarek said that unless Adtranz signed an agreement by the end of the month, the ministry would have to annul the tender and seek other ways of privatising the country's leading rolling-stock supplier.</p>
<p>The ministry is offering a 75 percent stake in Pafawag, based in the western city of Wroclaw.</p>
<p>According to Rzeczpospolita newspaper the company, which employs 1,680 people, had a 10 million zloty loss on sales of 68 million zlotys last year.</p>
<p>Swiss-Swedish group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG now controls 10 medium-size companies in Poland and has minority stakes in three more. Earlier this year it said would consider further acquisitions in Poland after buying Pafawag.</p>
<p>The privatisation ministry plans to earmark 20 percent of Pafawag shares for its employees and a five percent stake for a government scheme to compensate former owners for property confiscated under communist rule.</p>
