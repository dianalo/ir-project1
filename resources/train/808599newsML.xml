<p>Saudi Arabia has for the first time set official rules for private companies wanting to offer shares to the public as part of efforts to encourage more firms to list on the Gulf's biggest bourse.</p>
<p>The regulations, which stipulate requirements for private firms converting to public joint stock companies, were issued by Commerce Minister Osama bin Jaafar bin Ibrahim Faqih in a decree carried by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They cover everything from capital and profit requirements to the need to issue a comprehensive prospectus before listing.</p>
<p>The rules, which come into effect when they are published in the official gazette, say a firm should be at least 10 years old, offer no less than 51 percent of its shares to the public and have a minimum capital of 75 million riyals ($20 million).</p>
<p>They specify each company must have an annual return on equity of at least 10 percent for the five years before listing and guarantee similar returns for five years afterwards.</p>
<p>SPA said the regulations aimed at &quot;enabling government officials to take any decision on turning a company public objectively and easily&quot;. They also aimed at giving current owners and potential investors as much necessary information as possible to make investment decisions.</p>
<p>Financial analysts and businessmen in the kingdom welcomed the law, but cautioned that some conditions might be too restrictive.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an attempt to strengthen companies going public and boost local investor confidence in the market,&quot; said a finance consultant. &quot;But it remains to be seen if the requirements are too stringent to attract those well reputed, established firms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is an excellent focus on disclosure,&quot; Rana Investment Company General Manager Fahad Almubarak told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But some requirements are rather stiff,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The rules requiring annual returns of 10 percent for five years before listing and which deal with guaranteeing returns of 10 percent annually for five years after listing were too harsh, analysts said. They also said criticised as too stiff the regulations allowing only firms at least 10 years old to list.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to see 10 percent over the past five years as an average return, not a minimum,&quot; Almubarak said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the law would address only those firms which were established and successful. &quot;It opens the window only to very well performing companies. But why would a company meeting this kind of criteria want to sell,&quot; one noted.</p>
<p>&quot;There are very few companies that fit these criteria. It is not impossible, but it is really a role model they want to give out to the public,&quot; Almubarak said.</p>
<p>Many firms in Saudi Arabia are family-run enterprises. Amid high domestic liquidity and limited investment opportunities at home, many Saudi investors put their cash in Western markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The criteria are more conservative and restrictive than in the West. But it is a wise way to start,&quot; Almubarak said.</p>
<p>There are 70 firms listed on the Saudi bourse, capitalised at around $48 billion, but only a handful are actively traded.</p>
<p>&quot;The rest are not well traded because of their disappointing performance and poor disclosure. These steps are designed to strengthen firms and support the market,&quot; the consultant said.</p>
<p>Financial analysts said other positive aspects of the law were that it would introduce greater transparency, did not restrict the type of businesses that could go public and limited majority shareholders' voting power.</p>
<p>Other requirements include:</p>
<p>- firms must specify directors' remuneration and benefits</p>
<p>- disclosure of management's stakes in any other firms</p>
<p>- financial statements for the last five years</p>
<p>- details on any lawsuits involving the firm</p>
<p>- a guarantee of subscription to shares that are not fully taken up by the public</p>
<p>- details of the company's future financial prospects</p>
