<p>French Culture Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy, stabbed in the back last week during a campaign swing, was discharged from hospital on Tuesday but needs more time to convalesce, hospital officials said.</p>
<p>Aides whisked away Douste-Blazy to an undisclosed location where he could recover in peace from a stab wound to the lung and two broken ribs, the officials said.</p>
<p>Douste-Blazy was attacked last Friday while campaigning in his constituency in the Catholic shrine of Lourdes, southwest France. France is preparing for a two-round parliamentary election on May 25 and June 1.</p>
<p>A 37-year-old man of Albanian origin, Adlal Cifti, has been placed under investigation for attempted first degree murder in connection with the knifing but has denied guilt.</p>
<p>Cifti, who was under psychiatric treatment, had already attacked Douste-Blazy with a screwdriver in 1992.</p>
