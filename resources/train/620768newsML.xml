<title>SPAIN: Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</title>
<headline>Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>Spanish government bonds closed lower, dragged down by widespread jitters ahead of the second round of French elections and fears of an EMU delay.</p>
<p>But bonos ended off their lows as domestic investors bought on dips, showing some resilience to foreign turbulence, dealers said.</p>
<p>They pointed to the long bond future ending at 115.00, which is considered strong support. Dealers said a correction was long overdue after recent bullishness.</p>
<p>&quot;The (10-year) spread over Bunds now stands at more logical levels,&quot; a Madrid-based dealer said.  </p>
<p>The spread, which was trading earlier at around its all-time low at 65 basis points, closed at 73 basis points.</p>
<p>The pressure on the peseta, which ended at 84.85/88 per mark against 84.40/41 at Tuesday's close, was the main thing driving the market in the afternoon, a dealer said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, the Bank of Spain was seen buying pesetas for marks at around 84.80/85.00, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors made a good profit buying (pesetas) this morning and selling in the afternoon,&quot; a dealer in Madrid said. Trading volume in foreign exchange was seen higher than usual.  </p>
<p>&quot;The underlying trend here remains positive,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;We have to move together with the others (European markets) but people here remain convinced the Bank of Spain will cut its key rate more despite what Rojo said.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Central Bank Governor Luis Angel Rojo said Spanish CPI could pick up during the summer but would likely end the year below 2.0 percent. He added that monetary policy would remain prudent.</p>
<p>&quot;Even with a bad outcome from French elections, we expect the Bank of Spain to bring its key money rate to 4.5 percent by year-end,&quot; a dealer said. The rate now stands at 5.25 percent.</p>
