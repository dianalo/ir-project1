<p>Blue-chip stocks were again caught in a downdraft Thursday as concern about the earnings of International Business Machines Corp. was added to the list of bearish factors that have dogged the market for the past week.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 46.08 points at 6,470.93 after an initial plunge of more than 80 points.</p>
<p>By Thursday's opening, the index of 30-blue-chip stocks had fallen 364 points in the last four sessions, the third-largest point decline over any similar period.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues swamped advances 14-8 on moderate volume of 283 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index, however, rallied 7.01 points to 1,208.01 on the back of strength in technology stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;You have a fluctuating Dow because the mood has changed on Wall Street,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot;We have moved from the perception of a goldilocks economy to fears of a boom-and-bust economy.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected the blue-chip market to remain defensive ahead of the Friday's March employment report, one of the indicators investors are watching to get a clue as to whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again.</p>
<p>A strong jobs report would heighten expectations of another interest rate hike after the Fed raised short-term rates last week.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters expected the unemployment rate to show a 0.1 percent drop and non-farm payrolls to rise by 182,000.</p>
<p>The focus also will be on possible upward pressures on wages.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe the correction in stocks may be drawing to a close even if the employment data lead to another market drubbing.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are getting enough of an oversold condition to be able to catch our breath shortly,&quot; said Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Everen Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;I choose to believe this weakness is a temporary phase because, by and large, volume has been moderate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>IBM, which was down 3-3/8 at 130-3/8 after having sunk as low as 128-7/8, reacted to a Wall Street Journal article that said analysts were slimming down their earnings estimates for IBM., not just for the first and second quarters but for all of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to see the techs rally despite IBM weakness. Generally, though, the market is very, very weak,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;There is pressure on portfolio managers to raise cash either in response to redemptions or in anticipation of redemptions.&quot;</p>
