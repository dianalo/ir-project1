<p>Japan's current account surplus will continue to show a steady decline for July, although the pace would have slowed down due to the penetration of the effect of a weaker yen, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of economists showed forecasts for the surplus averaging 495.5 billion yen, down from 781.5 billion yen a year ago. Estimates ranged from 425 to 567 billion yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The surplus is diminishing, but the falling tempo would decelerate clearly,&quot; Masanobu Takahashi, director at Sanyo Investment Research, told Reuters Financial Television. The data will be announced on Monday at 8.50 a.m.(2350 GMT Sunday).  </p>
<p>Concerning merchandise trade, exports would have rebounded in July due to an increase in automobile exports, economists said. The level of imports stayed high, they said, but the pace of growth has peaked out somewhat.</p>
<p>&quot;This is essentially a response to the weakening of the yen (against the dollar) that we saw in the past year,&quot; Peter Morgan, a senior economist at James Capel Tokyo, told RFTV.</p>
<p>Some economists said that Japanese companies' moves to shift their production overseas have peaked out, while others said the trend was still continuing, although the pace may quicken or slow depending on moves in currency rates.  </p>
<p>Hiroshi Suzuki, an economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said he would like to see whether the rebound in exports was just a temporary trend or a lasting one.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to judge from one month worth of merchandise trade, but there's definitely been a change. We're keeping close watch to see whether the trend has altered,&quot; Suzuki said.</p>
<p>The deficit in services would likely expand as many Japanese took off for overseas destinations during their summer holidays, economists said. The financial account figure would continue to show capital outflows as investors looked overseas for higher yielding financial products.  </p>
<p>The following are the estimates for current account surplus estimates given by economists:</p>
<p>    MERRILL LYNCH	  477 bln yen</p>
<p>    SALOMON BROTHERS     440 bln yen</p>
<p>    DAIWA BANK RESEARCH  567 bln yen</p>
<p>    BZW			550 bln yen</p>
<p>    JAMES CAPEL	    520 bln yen</p>
<p>    SANYO INVESTMENT     490 bln yen</p>
<p>    TECHNICAL DATA	 425 bln yen</p>
