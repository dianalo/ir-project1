<p>About 300,000 pilgrims attended a colourful mass at the Eiffel Tower on Tuesday at the start of a Roman Catholic youth festival during which Pope John Paul will preach strict morality to an often sceptical flock.</p>
<p>Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, Archbishop of Paris, led an open-air mass with dozens of cardinals and bishops before a congregation of young people waving banners and flags on the grass of the Champ-de-Mars park under sweltering, hazy sunshine.</p>
<p>One man carried a makeshift cross on his back. African drummers and dancers alternated with organists playing hymns and choirs chanting. On the fringes, souvenir sellers peddled commemorative T-shirts, hats and pens.</p>
<p>The mass, guarded by 1,700 police, marked the start of the week-long 12th World Youth Days, due to be attended by hundreds of thousands of young people from more than 160 countries and culminating with a mass by the Pope on Sunday.</p>
<p>The pontiff will visit Paris for four days from Thursday as part of a drive to counter a slide in religious zeal among the young, especially in rich nations like France.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally we are together,&quot; Lustiger told the crowd estimated by police at roughly 300,000 people.</p>
<p>Many pilgrims acknowledged that, while they had come to Paris partly to see the Pope and for the religious ceremonies, they were also in France as tourists.</p>
<p>And many expressed scepticism about the Pontiff's moral teachings such as opposition to birth control and pre-marital sex.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not married and I have a baby so we all fall short of the graces of God,&quot; said 18-year-old American Temika Sosa of Las Cruces, New Mexico.</p>
<p>The Pope &quot;is out of touch but it's also his responsibility to guide us morally,&quot; she added. &quot;We need to be united in Christ, I think that's what's going to get us through the 20th century. Because everything's going to pot.&quot;</p>
<p>Lustiger urged the young to struggle to find love in Christ and follow the idealistic example of Saint Therese Martin, a French nun devoted to Christ who died of tuberculosis 100 years ago aged 24. The mass was dedicated to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not give up! Do not choose mediocrity! God wants the greatest happiness for you!,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Half a million people are expected to attend the festival's closing ceremony, a vast open-air mass to be celebrated by the Pope at the Longchamp racetrack on the western outskirts of Paris on Sunday.</p>
<p>Four million people attended a mass given by the Pope at the last World Youth Days in Manila two years ago.</p>
