<p>Prosecutors in the Oklahoma City bombing trial rested their case on Wednesday after calling a survivor and a firefighter to drive home to jurors the horror of the worst attack on civilians in U.S. history.</p>
<p>&quot;Your honour, on behalf of the United States, I'm pleased to announce that we rest,&quot; chief prosecutor Joseph Hartzler told federal Judge Richard Matsch shortly before midday.</p>
<p>The prosecution presented 137 witnesses in 18 days, weaving a web of circumstantial evidence to tie defendant Timothy McVeigh to the April 19, 1995 blast that took 168 lives at the Alfred P. Murrah federal building.</p>
<p>The prosecution's final witnesses included the head of the Federal Employees Credit Union, who described how seven women she was holding a meeting with disappeared when the bomb went off and a firefighter who described how people were mutilated when the building collapsed.</p>
<p>Chief defence attorney Steven Jones said he would present his first witness on Thursday. He told reporters his case may last &quot;possibly less than two weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege McVeigh, 29, bombed the federal building to avenge the 80 Branch Davidian cult members killed in a confrontation with federal agents at Waco, Texas in 1993.</p>
<p>McVeigh, a decorated Gulf War veteran, pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and conspiracy. He could face the death penalty if convicted.</p>
<p>After the jury was dismissed for the day, Jones filed a motion to dismiss the charges against McVeigh on the grounds the prosecution had failed to prove its case.</p>
<p>Matsch denied the motion, which is routinely filed by the defence in criminal cases, but reserved judgment on defence motions to delete parts of the indictment against McVeigh.</p>
<p>Jones said prosecutors failed to prove allegations in the indictment that McVeigh bought 2,000 pounds (907 kg) of ammonium nitrate or that the bomb was built at a state park in Kansas. Ammonium nitrate was a key component of the bomb, the prosecution says.</p>
<p>The prosecution kept some of its most graphic testimony for last, clearly trying to impress on jurors' minds the carnage and destruction in the federal building.</p>
<p>Florence Rogers, chief executive of the Federal Employees Credit Union on the third floor of the Murrah building, described in a low voice how seven women employees she was meeting with in her office were blown away by the blast.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was able to stand up, all of the girls in my office had totally disappeared, with the six floors from above us on top of them. I never saw them again,&quot; Rogers said.</p>
<p>Relatives of bombing victims sobbed as Rogers read out the names of 18 credit union employees killed in the blast.</p>
<p>Mike Shannon, special operations chief of the Oklahoma City Fire Department, described how people were squeezed when the building collapsed, creating a hazard for rescuers.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything was crushed into a very small space. That created like a grape effect, squeezing grapes. Body fluids were dripping through and it would just drip onto your gear as you were crawling through, onto your helmet ... so there was a problem with disease,&quot; he testified.</p>
<p>Shannon said when he first entered the building after the blast a woman grabbed him. &quot;She put her nose to my nose and chastised me about the children of the second floor, telling me to get up there...,&quot; he said. Nineteen children were killed, most of them in the second-floor day care centre.</p>
<p>McVeigh sat impassively through most of the session.</p>
<p>The final prosecution witness was Fred Jordan, the Oklahoma state medical examiner, who described the grim task of identifying the bodies.</p>
<p>Prosecution witnesses have testified that McVeigh talked about bombing the federal building and shopped for bomb materials. A witness identified McVeigh as the man who rented the Ryder truck used in the bombing and an FBI scientist said he found traces of explosives on McVeigh's clothes.</p>
<p>But there were gaps in the prosecution case. No one placed McVeigh in Oklahoma City on the day of the bombing and his fingerprints were not found on key evidence.</p>
