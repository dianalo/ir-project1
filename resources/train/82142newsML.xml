<p>Gilt futures shot higher on Friday, reversing sessions of underperformance while core European bonds could post only modest gains, dealers said.</p>
<p>The December gilt future was trading at 108-31 at 0930 GMT, up 16/32 on the day and just below a 109-02 contract high set earlier in the session.</p>
<p>The gilt/Bund spread shot in to 171 basis points from 177 late on Thursday. At times this week, it has widened beyond 180.</p>
<p>&quot;Gilts have underperformed over the past couple of weeks and are playing catch-up,&quot; said Jonathan York, futures broker at Cater Allen. &quot;There's quite a bit of upside here.&quot;</p>
<p>At the short end of the market, short sterling futures also found a new lease of life.</p>
<p>The December contract gained three basis points to 94.04, the March future rose four to 93.90 and the June contract leapt seven basis points to 93.66.</p>
<p>Looking further out, 1998 and 1999 contracts leapt by 14 or 15 basis points. But analysts said this did not reflect a long-term reappraisal of British interest rate prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;Short sterling has purely been dragged up by the gilt,&quot; said Peter Osler, economist at GNI. &quot;I think it has gone a bit too far.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists said gilts had suffered in the aftermath of last weekend's meeting of European Union leaders in Ireland.</p>
<p>EU officials said agreement on a stability pact and a new exchange rate mechanism meant European Economic and Monetary Union was bang on target for its intended start date in January 1999.</p>
<p>That prompted a wave of convergence trades by Europe's more peripheral bond markets over Bunds. But the UK's opt-out clause from a single currency left gilts outside the convergence plays prompted by pro-EMU sentiment.</p>
<p>Convergence trades aim to profit from the narrowing of the differences between currencies as EMU approaches.</p>
<p>Analysts said Friday's gilt rally showed investors are saying enough is enough and reappraising the fundamental value the gilt market offers. &quot;It's about time,&quot; said Steve Scott, gilts analyst at Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>&quot;There was always going to be support for gilts above 180. The intraday peak of 183 earlier this week probably lured buyers back in,&quot; Scott said.</p>
<p>The relative moves by the Swedish and Spanish bond markets had prompted investors to re-evaluate, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's probably another 10 basis points of narrowing for gilts (over Bunds) in the medium-term.&quot;</p>
