<p>North Korea has proposed that the issues of U.S. troops in South Korea and a peace agreement with the United States be put on the agenda for peace talks among the two Koreas, the United States and China, Pyongyang's official media reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;At the preliminary talks the DPRK (North Korea) delegation proposed that the conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S., and the withdrawal of South Korea-based U.S. troops be main items of the agenda at the 'four-way talks',&quot; the Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary.</p>
<p>&quot;Freeing the Korean peninsula from foreign troops is the way of ensuring a durable peace and a main task to be fulfilled by 'four-way talks',&quot; the Rodong Sinmun said.</p>
<p>The commentary was carried by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) monitored in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Representatives of the four countries met in New York on Tuesday for preliminary talks on launching substantive negotiations to replace the 1950-53 Korean War armistice with a more permanent peace mechanism.</p>
<p>The negotiators accepted, over North Korean objections, China's suggestion to deal first with easier issues such as the date, level of representation and venue for the substantive talks, and leave the thornier topic of the agenda for last.</p>
<p>North Korean officials were not available for comment in New York, but South Korean officials quoted them as saying that peace talks should not interfere in domestic affairs and that U.S. forces in South Korea should be on the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;If this issue (of U.S. troops) is settled, other matters can be resolved between the North and the South of Korea, not by four parties,&quot; the Rodong Sinmun said.</p>
<p>The four parties will meet again in New York on Wednesday.</p>
