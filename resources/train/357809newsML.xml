<p>Michaels Stores Inc said Tuesday its same-store sales for January 1997 dropped 1.0 percent from the comparable five week period in 1996.</p>
<p>It said sales in January 1997 were up 23 percent to $138.1 million from $111.9 million a year ago.  </p>
<p>For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1996 ending February 1, 1997, it said sales rose 8.0 percent to $493.7 million from $456.7 million in the previous year.  Same-store sales for the quarter increased three percent.</p>
<p>Total sales for fiscal year 1996 were up six percent to $1.38 billion from $1.29 billion in fiscal 1995, it said. Same store sales for the year declined 1.0 percent, it said.  </p>
<p>Michael Rouleau, chief executive officer, said that as part of a plan to strengthen the company it has sold off  nearly all the furniture that is not a part of its ongoing merchandise strategy. He said the company also sold off significant quantities of inventory not needed at this time.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, rather than carry over excess Christmas merchandise, I made the decision to sell it off so that we could get off to a fresh start in 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
