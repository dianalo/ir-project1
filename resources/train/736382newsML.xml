<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch bonds closed with good gains on Thursday, lifted by rising Bund futures and encouraged by the dollar retreating a little in Europe, dealers said.</p>
<p>But the Dutch market was again squeezed in comparison to Germany, they said, as investors found reason to switch in the longer maturities.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no big sellers, but Guilders were definitely under pressure,&quot; one broker said. &quot;But that is often what happens when the market is rising.&quot;</p>
<p>Some players have been predicting the yield discount between Dutch and German bonds to move towards zero in the near term.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think that depends on the directionof the market,&quot; the broker said. &quot;If we don't push higher and hang around here, or even move down again, we should see some good demand for Guilders around these levels.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dutch market's move up on Thursday was largely in the wake of the September Bund future moving up to test the 103.00 resistance level, a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be tricky to get through that,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm expecting a few bounces, so the way up is not clear yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The long end of the Dutch curve was the big gainer on the day, with the 30-year bond rising a half-point.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's hope there we may get some of the benefit of investors moving out of long-dated high-yield debt,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
