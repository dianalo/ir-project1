<headline>INSIGHT - Buy-on-dip seen prevailing in US T-bonds.</headline>

<p>Buying-on-dip strategies look to be the flavor of the month in the bullish but overbought U.S. Treasury bond futures market, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>With bond prices still in a three-month-old rising channel, the market is likely to stay well supported on pullbacks, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd certainly be willing to buy during any weakness that develops in the next week or two,&quot; said Jim Bohan, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.</p>
<p>Basically, he noted, the market has been in a consolidative range-trade in the past several days.  </p>
<p>Early Tuesday, September T-bonds slipped to a low of 113-7/32, down 23/32 on the day, on stronger than expected June U.S. retail sales data. Then they quickly reversed and recouped most of the losses by late morning trade.</p>
<p>&quot;It's looking much better on the reaction bounce off the lows,&quot; said Matthew Crosson, director of fixed income at Pegasus Econometrics Group.</p>
<p>He said a trendline on the hourly charts, coming in in the 113-26/32 to 113-28/32 area, was hindering a further bounce back for now but added that he anticipated the market to edge higher in the near term.  </p>
<p>He added that the daily stochastic and other short-term oscillators, which had been looking toppish for some time now, had yet to come down out of the overbought territory.</p>
<p>Still, analysts agreed that the lower end of the rising channel supported September T-bonds in the low-112 area, while the mid-114 to mid-115 area was strong channel resistance.</p>
<p>Bohan added that that resistance area coincided with the December 1996 highs.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of the fact that you're bumping into the upper end of the trend channel and the '96 resistance, I think, has produced a consolidation phase,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Crosson pointed out that commodity prices, which had fallen with strong negative correlation to rising bond prices in recent months, appeared to be basing now.</p>
<p>That, he said, might also dampen bonds' advances somewhat in the near term.</p>
<p>&quot;This very well could go on for a while longer,&quot; Bohan said, predicting a few more weeks of consolidation.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, though, I expect the market to go higher, maybe significantly higher, because the background is so positive,&quot; he said. &quot;If there are going to be surprises, I would think they would be on the upside.&quot;</p>
