<headline>NHL-DALLAS STARS GIVE COACH HITCHCOCK CONTRACT EXTENSION.</headline>
<dateline>DALLAS 1997-05-19</dateline>

<p>Dallas Stars head coach Ken Hitchcock, who took a last place team and guided it to the Central Division title this season, was given a contract extension on Monday through the 1998-99 season.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old Hitchcock, originally under contract through the 1997-98 campaign, was rewarded despite his team's ouster in the first round of the NHL Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
<p>In his first full season as Dallas head coach, Hitchcock oversaw one of the most dramatic turnarounds in National Hockey League history.</p>
<p>After finishing the 1995-96 season last in the Central Division with a 26-42-14 record, Dallas posted the second best record in the league at 48-26-8 for 104 points -- franchise records for both victories and points, including the team's years as the Minnesota North Stars.</p>
<p>Despite the whopping 38-point improvement in the standings, however, the Stars were upset by the Edmonton Oilers in seven games in a first-round playoff series.</p>
<p>Hitchcock, who was promoted to his current job on January 8, 1996, is one of three finalists for the Jack Adams Award -- the NHL's version of Coach of the Year.</p>
<p>The Stars also gave contract extensions to assistant coaches Doug Jarvis and Rick Wilson through the 1998-99 season.</p>
