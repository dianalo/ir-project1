<p>Philippine Central Bank Treasurer Sergio Edeza said on Friday it could lower its key interest rate again.</p>
<p>&quot;We think we should lower it again depending on the situation in the market. We think the situation three weeks ago has normalised,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Rates have recently been falling after reaching a two-year high in mid-May as the Bank defended the peso from speculative attack.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, the Central Bank trimmed its overnight borrowing rate by two percentage points to 14 percent, the third cut in three weeks as the peso gained strength.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation numbers were favourable. That gives us confidence in lowering the rates again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the government reported that year-on-year inflation in May fell to a ten-year low of 4.2 percent compared with 4.6 percent in April.</p>
<p>Edeza added &quot;We're looking at investment flows into the country and we think they're coming back.&quot;</p>
