<headline>Jakarta index end higher, Astra and Sampoerna up.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1996-10-11</dateline>

<p>Jakarta index ended higher on Friday after local-led active buying of vehicle manufacturer Astra International and cigarette maker Sampoerna, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index rose 3.30 points, or 0.58 percent to close at 571.23 points. Losers led gainers 59 to 52, with 54 counters unchanged.</p>
<p>Brokers said speculative buying of Astra was likely to continue in the coming week following media report that Nusamba group to which Indonesia's President Suharto is linked is interested in buying a stake in the country's largest automobile manufacturer.  </p>
<p>The Kompas newspaper quoted timber tycoon Muhamad &quot;Bob&quot; Hasan as saying in an interview the firm he controls is interested in purchasing a stake in Astra for investment purposes.</p>
<p>Brokers said any news linking Astra International and Sampoerna could move the market in the coming week. &quot;But I doubt fresh foreign buying could emerge on those stocks,&quot; one foreign broker said.</p>
<p>They said today's rise was largely supported by local-led buying on Astra and limited foreign buying on cigarette maker Sampoerna.  </p>
<p>&quot;Many local operators used this momentum to buying actively on selected secondaries,&quot; said one local broker.</p>
<p>Head of sales one domestic major brokerage firm said the market was likely to stabilise in the coming week. &quot;This week fall is technically normal after the sharp rise in the previous week. So I think market is stabilising,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Astra topped the active list with 13.5 million shares traded. It soared 11.27 percent to 3,950 rupiah. Sampoerna rose 252 rupiah to 19,600 with 1.2 million shares traded on what brokers said was limited foreign buying on perceptions that the share price was cheap.  </p>
<p>Sampoerna fell sharply earlier in the week due to a foreign sell-off after Moody's said it had put a company loan on creditwatch after it bought the largest stake in Astra.</p>
<p>Sampoerna last week announced it had obtained a $400 million bank loan without specifying the purpose.</p>
<p>Supermarket operator Hero were actively traded due to local-led speculative buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the rise of Hero was due to market talk that the firm might buy back shares from the regular market for unspecify reasons. &quot;But its price was quite cheap, while its fundamental are good,&quot; said another local broker.  </p>
<p>Photograpic equipment manufacturer Inter Delta was also actively traded on market talk of a possible acquisition. It rose 175 rupiah to 3,225 on a volume of 1.5 million shares.</p>
