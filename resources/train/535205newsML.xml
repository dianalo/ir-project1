<p>Slovak central bank Governor Vladimir Masar said on Thursday there were no plans for an easing of monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;At present we are not considering easing monetary policy, including any rate cut,&quot; Masar told Reuters.  </p>
<p>He said that the central bank may consider easing if the trade balance shows positive development as the year progresses.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to achieve a foreign trade deficit of around five percent of GDP. And if this looks achievable, the central bank may then consider easing its policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he said that if the trade balance shows a negative trend, there would be no changes considered.</p>
<p>The Slovak trade deficit for 1996 widened to nearly 65 billion crowns from just under six billion in 1995.</p>
<p>It showed signs of narrowing in the first two months of the year -- the deficit totalled 10.821 billion crowns for the January-February period, down from 13.193 billion for the same period last year -- but analysts say that several large investment projects would widen it again later in the year.  </p>
<p>Masar added that the country's import deposit plan announced on Wednesday could be a good sterilisation tool if the funds collected are kept out of the money supply, but warned that if they are not, the central bank would have little room to move on rates.</p>
<p>&quot;It will depend on how this measure will be used, and if it will help the further sterilisation of the money supply, then again we may consider a loosening of the policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the plan, a 20 percent deposit for imports of unspecified goods from all countries will take effect from May 1. The non-interest bearing deposits will be held for 180 days in Slovak banks to be named later this month.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik told a conference that the government and the central bank were holding discussions over changes to monetary policy, though &quot;no conclusions have come from the talks so far&quot;.</p>
<p>The central bank's key discount rate currently stands at 8.8 percent.</p>
