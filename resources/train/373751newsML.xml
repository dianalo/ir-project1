<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, under pressure to revamp the 1997 budget which aims to make Germany fit for Europe's single currency, on Wednesday took a step towards reaching a compromise on his planned tax reform.</p>
<p>Waigel is under pressure to win the support of opposition Social Democrats (SPD) for his income tax reforms and for spending cuts needed to plug a widening budget deficit caused by record unemployment and Germany's weak economy.</p>
<p>Facing shrill SPD attacks on his policies, Waigel presented concrete prosposals for the first time that could bring forward the income tax reform by one year to 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;A condition, however, is that a part of the financing measures proposed by the tax reform commission also take effect in 1998,&quot; Waigel said in a speech at a traditional Ash Wednesday gathering of his Christian Social Union (CSU) party.</p>
<p>The government coalition, made up of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), the CSU and the Free Democrats (FDP), has proposed a 30 billion mark ($18 billion) net tax cut in 1999 that would cut the top rate to 39 percent.</p>
<p>The SPD, which can block parts of the tax reform with its majority in the upper house of parliament, has urged Bonn to bring forward the tax cuts to 1998. It opposes government plans to partly finance the reform by raising value added tax.</p>
<p>Waigel's proposed lowering the entry level income tax rate &quot;in the direction of 20 percent&quot; next year from 25.9 percent now and reduce the top rate to &quot;below 50 percent&quot;.</p>
<p>Chancellery Minister Friedrich Bohl said the government wanted to present a draft tax bill in April and hoped that talks with the SPD could begin &quot;three or four weeks after Easter&quot;.</p>
<p>Oskar Lafontaine, the feisty SPD party leader, in an interview with the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, indicated the government and the SPD were still far from any agreement.</p>
<p>Lafontaine has said repeatedly that while the government's tax reform would relieve low-wage earners and the wealthy, the large masses of the middle class would benefit less. He said the SPD now preferred leaving the top tax rate at 53 percent.</p>
<p>Still, Lafontaine suggested a compromise could be reached without a lengthy battle in parliament's mediation committee.</p>
<p>&quot;On the basis of goodwill we do not need more than a week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite Waigel's gesture, mud slinging dominated the tone of the debate.</p>
<p>&quot;Through their resistance against the government's reform plans, the SPD is sabotaging Germany's future,&quot; said Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber &quot;Through their resistance against the government's reform plans, the SPD is sabotaging Germany's future,&quot; Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber said.</p>
<p>The mood in Kohl's 14-year-old coalition also remained chilled, as Guido Westerwelle, general secretary of the FDP, called the CDU's pension reform proposal the &quot;millstone around the neck of reformers&quot; in Germany.</p>
<p>Pressure is mounting on Waigel to explain how he will fill the widening budget gap as doubts grow that Germany will fail to meet the criteria for European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Independent economists have said that high unemployment would add between 10 billion and 18 billion marks to government spending. The SPD called on Waigel to present a supplementary budget, while a senior FDP official called for an immediate freeze on government spending.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of economists showed that despite government proclamations to the contrary most no longer believed Germany would be able to keep its budget deficit and public debt within the limits set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>The participants in the first round of monetary union, due to be launched in 1999, will be chosen next year based on the economic performance of member states in 1997.</p>
<p>Waigel stressed again that the Maastricht criteria could not be watered down to allow countries to join.</p>
<p>&quot;The Euro will start only with the countries which fulfill the preconditions,&quot; Waigel said in Passau near Munich. &quot;I will not stand for a weakening of the stability criteria.&quot; ($ = 1.679 German Marks)</p>
