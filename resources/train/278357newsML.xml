<headline>National carlot beef trade weekly review - USDA.</headline>
<dateline>DES MOINES 1996-12-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Boxed beef traded higher on very light demand and offerings during the shortened holiday week, USDA said. Retail and Hotel/Restaurant/Institution demand was for immediate needs, while forward interest was rather light. Even though the curent light Choice and Select spread is 9.00, most Choice end meats traded at the same levels as the Select end meats.</p>
<p>Chuck and round cuts continued to trend higher with the biggest advances on Select round cuts. Rib and loin cuts traded higher as most sales were for immediate needs for the holiday season.  </p>
<p>Closely trimmed items also traded higher with modest gains on most cuts. Beef trimmings traded at steady levels early in the week, but ended the trading period on a weak undertone. Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items were higher on moderate demand and light offerings.</p>
<p>For the week - Select and Choice rib primal 1.00 to 4.00 higher; Select and Choice chuck primal 1.00 to 1.50 higher; Select and Choice round primal 1.00 to 3.00 higher; Select and Choice loin primal 1.00 to 3.00 higher; Closely trimmed items 1.50 to 2.00 higher; Beef trimmings 1.00 lower; Fed cattle and blended coarse ground items 2.00 to 4.00 higher.</p>
<p>The Estimated Composite of Boxed Beef Cutout values of Choice 1-3 550/700 carcasses Up 1.60 at 107.74; 700/850 Up 1.76 at 106.07; Select 1-3 550/700 carcasses Up 2.04 at 98.74; 700/850 Up 1.99 at 98.19.</p>
<p>COW AND BULL CARCASS, BONELESS PROCESSING BEEF, CUTTER COW CUTOUT Lean boneless beef trended sharply higher for the week on good demand and limited offerings. Production was already curtailed by the observance of the Christmas holiday at midweek when bitter winter weather over the upper Midwest slowed the movement of cows to slaughter points.</p>
<p>The resulting shortage of product fueled the rapid price increase. Trading of cow carcasses was retarded by the same conditions and carcasses remained unestablished as the week closed. Cow cuts were lightly traded for the week with some firmness noted for 100% lean items.</p>
<p>Utility and Cutter carcasses were not established; Fresh 90% boneless beef 8.00 to 10.00 higher in the Midwest, Texas mostly 7.00 higher; 85% mostly 5.00 higher; 75% 4.00 higher; 65% firm. The Cutter cow carcass gross cut-out value for Thursday, December 26, 1996 was estimated at 72.51 per cwt., up 5.81 from a week ago Friday.</p>
