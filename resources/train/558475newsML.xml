<p>The kidnapped daughter of a Honduran shrimp magnate has been found murdered, becoming the third kidnap victim to be killed in the past two months, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ianty Hill, 19, was abducted from a bus in northern Honduras on Tuesday and found dead in a cheap rented room in Tegucigala on Friday, a police officer who asked not to be identified told Reuters.</p>
<p>The violence is part of a larger crime wave that led officials on Saturday to deploy 1,000 army troops on the streets of the capital.</p>
<p>Police captured three of her four kidnappers, who were seeking about $39,000 from the girl's family, the officer said. Jose Fanez, one of the captured kidnappers, was paraded before the media by police. He said Hill was killed after she tried to escape.</p>
<p>&quot;The girl wanted to escape from the room and my partner, first he hit her with his fist and then I think with a bottle. I think it was that blow (with the bottle) that killed her,&quot; Fanez told reporters.</p>
<p>Since July of last year, 10 kidnappings have been reported in Honduras involving children of businessmen or executives.</p>
<p>They are part of a larger crime wave involving a continuous series of bank robberies, break-ins, car thefts and other acts of violence.</p>
<p>Army sources said 1,000 troops were deployed on the streets of the capital on Saturday in the latest attempt to curb the lawlessness.</p>
