<headline>INSTANT VIEW- Politicians' comments on UK election.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-02</dateline>

<p>Following are comments from politicians on Labour's unprecedented victory in the British election, made after Prime Minister John Major conceded defeat for the Conservatives.</p>
<p>0349 GMT -- PADDY ASHDOWN, LEADER, LIBERAL DEMOCRATS</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a hugely increased number of Liberal Democrats in parliament.(They will) fight...for the issues in this election -- investing in education, tackling the crisis in the health service, bringing a new kind of honesty to our politics.&quot;</p>
<p>0350 GMT -- BRIAN MAWHINNEY, CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHAIRMAN</p>
<p>&quot;The British people decided it was time for a change despite the fact we have some of the best economic news this country has seen for a couple of generations.&quot;</p>
<p>0304 GMT - ROBIN COOK, LABOUR'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN</p>
<p>&quot;We're ready to hit the ground running.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People have put their trust in us and we must now ensure that we repay that trust.&quot;</p>
<p>0242 GMT - MICHAEL HESELTINE, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER IN OUTGOING CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>&quot;We will be back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is an extremely unfortunate result for the Conservative party but we have a huge sense of destiny and immense appetite for government and a track record for recovery.</p>
<p>0230 GMT -- CONSERVATIVE LEADER JOHN MAJOR, CONCEDING HIS GOVERNMENT'S DEFEAT TO LABOUR (after his own re-election in Huntingdon).</p>
<p>&quot;We are a great and historic party. We have had great victories in our time. We have had defeats in our time. We accept them both I hope with a certain dignity and a certain grace. Tonight we have been comprehensively defeated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will listen to the voice of the electorate. We will consider what has been said to us. I think we must reflect upon it. I know that we will and I know that when we have reflected we will begin to prepare once again for that day in the future -- I hope not too far distant -- when my party may once again return to government in the service of this country.</p>
<p>The Labour party has had an extremely successful evening. I telephoned Mr Blair a little over an hour ago to congratulate him on his success and to wish him every good fortune in the great responsibilities that he will have in the years that lie ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great country. He inherits a country in extremely good economic shape. I wish him every success in sustaining that in the interests of all the people of this country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I can promise the Conservative party will be a vigorous opposition.&quot;</p>
