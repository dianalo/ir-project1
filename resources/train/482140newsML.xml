<title>USA: CBOT corn mostly lower as bull spreads unwind.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn mostly lower as bull spreads unwind.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT corn futures closed mostly lower with unwinding of bull spreads featured along with increased farmer selling and weak basis markets, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bean and corn basis was weaker last night,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter.</p>
<p>Cash dealers in the U.S. Midwest said most corn and soybean basis bids were lower Wednesday and there were scattered instances of cash protection on corn and soybean basis bids early. But the spread action was central to the drop in the nearby futures contracts, the traders said.</p>
<p>The July/Dec ended at 18 cents a bushel, premium July, 4-1/4 cents narrower than Tuesday's closing spread of 22-1/4 cents, premium July. Cargill sold four million July and spread three million Dec/Jly at 20 to 20-1/2 cents, premium July.</p>
<p>Volatile dealings in the soybeans were cited. Soybeans opened lower on follow-through technical selling but ended higher on concerns over threats of port strikes in Brazil and on talk of less-than-expected soybean production in Brazil's Rio Grande du Sol growing region.</p>
<p>Corn closed 4-1/2 cents per bushel lower to 1/4 higher, with May down 4-1/2 at $3.08-1/2.  </p>
<p>Although there was noticeable unwinding of bull spreads, the establishment of new bull spreads was noted again in the active July/December, traders said. Griffin Trading did four million bushels of July/December at 20 cents, premium July, traders said.</p>
<p>The four- and 20-day moving averages (MA) for the May contract were giving off bullish signals early. The four-day MA for May was at $3.09 and the 20-day was at $3.03-3/4.</p>
<p>Technicians said first support in the May was at $3.10 and second support was at $3.02. The session low for May was $3.07-3/4. First resistance was at $3.18 and second resistance was at $3.26. The session high for May was $3.12-1/2.</p>
<p>The nine-day relative strength index (RSI) for the May closed at 60 percent. The market generally views an RSI of 70 or more as overbought and 30 or less as oversold.</p>
<p>Cargill Inc sold four million bushels of July and Dean Witter bought four million bushels of May, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 78,000 contracts, below the 96,922 traded Tuesday.</p>
<p>In corn options, ADM Investor Services bought 600 May $3.20 calls at three cents and sold 600 July $3.30 calls at 9-1/2 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 26,000 contracts, below the 36,608 traded Tuesday.</p>
