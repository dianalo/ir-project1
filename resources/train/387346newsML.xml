<p>The Baltic Freight Index (BFI) rose one point on Wednesday to 1,468 points.</p>
<p>Brokers said that it looked like shaping up to the usual spring season as the grain harvest in various countries appeared to be on schedule and crop forecasts looked good.</p>
<p>However, some brokers pointed towards the prospect of the Latin American crop being late, as possibly limiting any bullish feeling.</p>
<p>But generally brokers felt that demand for Atlantic and Pacific Panamaxes and for handies as well, was on the increase.</p>
<p>One factor that continued to give the market concern, was the ongoing amount of new ships emerging on the market, versus the relative lack of scrapping.</p>
<p>Brokers reported Yukong fixed 54,000 heavy grain US Gulf to Taiwan Mar 1/10 was fixed at $25.25, while Halla paid $14.50 for the same destination from Nopac. On timecharter business, Silver Star 69,402 dwt was taken by Yukong delivery Japan March 5/10 for three/five months at $12,000 daily. In minerals, Cobelfret fixed 150,000 tonnes coal Richards Bay/Rotterdam April 15/30 at $7, versus 140,000 tonnes on the same route by P and O for March 22/April 7 at $7.25.</p>
<p>Despite the general feeling that demand for Panamaxes and handy size vessels was rising, the BIFFEX at the close had slipped one to five points on a turnover totalling 175 lots. Most active April ended one point lower at 1,540 having traded 91 lots.</p>
