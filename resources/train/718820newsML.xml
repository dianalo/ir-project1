<p>The wife of indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic accused NATO forces on Thursday of committing a &quot;dishonest act&quot; when they arrested a suspect in Bosnian Serb-controlled territory.</p>
<p>Ljiljana Karadzic, head of the Red Cross in Bosnia's Serb territory, alleged that NATO forces had &quot;misused&quot; the Red Cross symbol while arresting a suspect in the northwest town of Prijedor, the Bosnian Serb news agency reported.</p>
<p>NATO peacekeeping troops said they arrested Milan Kovacevic, director of Prijedor hospital, and shot dead a second suspect who opened fire on British soldiers trying to arrest him.</p>
<p>Both men are charged by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in connection with a genocidal campaign to deport Moslems and Croats from the Prijedor region at the beginning of the 1992-95 conflict.</p>
<p>Mrs Karadzic alleged NATO soldiers entered the Prijedor hospital carrying a Red Cross parcel and pretending to deliver medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;Respecting the symbol of the Red Cross, doctor and humanist Kovacevic received them and wished to thank them. At that moment he was arrested...,&quot; Karadzic said in a letter to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
<p>She urged the ICRC to comment on the incident.</p>
<p>The NATO-led peace force offered few details of the arrest operation and spokesmen were unavailable to comment on the allegations.</p>
<p>Karadzic's husband, former president of Bosnian Serb territory, has been indicted twice by the tribunal for his conduct of the war. He remains at large.</p>
