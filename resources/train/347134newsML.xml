<p>Thailand hopes to boost rubber sales to eastern and central Europe to cash in on the region's fast economic development and the expected drop in Malaysia's natural rubber production, industry sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Thai industry aimed to increase its rubber sales to the European countries to 20 percent of Thailand's total rubber exports in the next five years from 13 percent now.</p>
<p>Wate Thainugul, the manager of the Hat Yai-based Thai Rubber Association, told Reuters that the consumption by central and eastern European countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Russia was growing by about 10 percent a year.</p>
<p>&quot;There is very a good potential there, given the pace of economic development in these countries,&quot; he said. &quot;Thai rubber exports to European countries currently account for only 13 percent our exports. We can perhaps boost it to 20 percent in the next five years.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, demand from Thailand's major buyers -- Japan, China and the United States -- was either slowing or rising marginally, Wate said.  </p>
<p>Japan accounted for 34 percent of Thai rubber exports, China around 23 percent and the United States around 13 percent, he added.</p>
<p>Thailand should benefit from a drop in natural rubber exports from Malaysia -- traditionally one of the world's biggest producers -- in coming years as the country's rubber-based industry grew, Wate said.</p>
<p>A commerce ministry source told Reuters that the ministry had assigned its trade representatives to promote Thai natural rubber in the European countries.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been some interesting rubber-related investments in central and eastern European countries recently, like South Korean (carmaker) Hyundai's assembly plant in Poland, for example,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>In September last year, Hyundai Corp said it was considering investing up to $1 billion in Poland over the next few years.</p>
<p>The month before, a joint venture between Hyundai and Polish trader PHZ Universal SA started to assemble Hyundai cars, although the Polish government has expressed its opposition to the venture.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is not a kind of opportunity we want to miss,&quot; the source said, adding that expansion in these markets was important as competition from other major producing countries, especially Indonesia, was hotting up in Thailand's conventional markets.</p>
<p>Thailand exported 400 million baht ($15.38 million) worth of rubber to eastern Europe in 1995, up from 300 million baht a year earlier.</p>
<p>According to industry sources, the European rubber market is now dominated by Indonesia, and Malaysia to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>&quot;But I'm sure we can compete. We can offer a quality product at competitive prices,&quot; said Wate.</p>
<p>In 1997, Thailand expects to export no less than the 1.72 million tonnes recorded last year. ($1 = 26 baht)</p>
