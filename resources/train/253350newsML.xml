<p>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV will re-jig global cargo services into premium and standard services at different price levels, Oliver Evans, sales director Central &amp; Eastern Europe, said.</p>
<p>The airline would fix price levels for the two existing types of service within the next few months, he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now gearing our product to through-put time. If customers require a specific flight it is a primary product,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are offering customers the opportunity to pay a premium for flight-specific shipments or to benefit from a price advantage against a longer through-put time,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>It was too early to say how much the price difference between the two services would be but the new structure would be introduced over the next couple of months, Evans said.</p>
<p>The re-naming would effectively formalise an existing separation of two services with new labels and price structure, he stressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Our customers are requiring two different types of services and we are now trying to clarify the services and make the distinctions clear, also the distinctions in the price,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>KLM believed the market demanded a &quot;time-definite&quot; express product and a lower-priced general airfreight service, Evans said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be very clearly marketed but we have no further information at this stage,&quot; he added. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017</p>
