<headline>UK group cites drinks which appealed to under-18s.</headline>

<p>Two alcoholic drinks, including a so-called alcopop and spirits packaged in plastic sachets that could be tucked into a pocket, violated British marketing guidelines by appealing to underage drinkers, a watchdog group said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Portman Group said its Independent Complaints Panel is currently considering 34 other complaints, including four complaints referred to the panel by the Portman Group itself.</p>
<p>The Portman Group said the panel upheld complaints against Bliss, a fruit-flavoured alcoholic drink packaged in pink and purple and sold for 29 pence, and against Totpak, spirits such as brandy, tequila and vodka packaged in plastic sachets.</p>
<p>&quot;The name 'Bliss and its packaging was considered likely to appeal to young girls, towards whom a magazine of the same name is targeted,&quot; the Portman Group said in its report.</p>
<p>Bliss is marketed by Utter Bliss Ltd.</p>
<p>The Portman Group also upheld complaints against Totpak, marketed by Pierhead Purchasing Ltd (Wines &amp; Spirits), saying that &quot;Totpak alcoholic sachets, containing neat spirits, were found to be unacceptable -- the portable, easy-to-hide packages being likely to appeal to under 18s.&quot;</p>
<p>The Portman Group said the products it has referred to the panel include Bullshit beer and Squeal, a fruit mix -- both of which were referred due to their potential appeal to those under age 18 -- and Scream'n Beaver beer and Kinky cider, referred due to their sexual connotations.</p>
