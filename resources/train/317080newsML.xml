<p>Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky is likely to offer his resignation on Saturday, a senior source inside Vranitzky's Social Democratic Party said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would assume that this will happen,&quot; the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Reports of Vranitzky's impending resignation in two Austrian dailies on Saturday were &quot;not far from the truth&quot;, he added.  </p>
<p>The source said Vranitzky, 59, had called a meeting of his party's executive committee at 4 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Saturday to offer his resignation.</p>
<p>According to reports in two leading Austrian dailies, Vranitzky was likely to be succeeded as chancellor and head of the Social Democrats by Finance Minister Viktor Klima, 49.</p>
<p>Vranitzky's spokesman Karl Krammer declined to comment on the reports. &quot;There is no comment whatsoever from our side. I haven't even spoken to the chancellor myself,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, a former banker and one-time professional basketball player who became chancellor in 1986, has repeatedly been reported to have become tired of politics.</p>
