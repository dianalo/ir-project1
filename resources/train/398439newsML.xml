<p>Indian authorities on Monday began the mass cremation of unidentified victims of an inferno that killed at least 200 worshippers at a Hindu gathering, police and eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;One hundred and thirty four bodies were consigned to the flames this evening en masse,&quot; said Santosh Upadhyaya, police chief of the eastern town of Baripada.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a horrible task to collect the bodies and then arrange for their cremation.&quot;</p>
<p>Thousands of relatives, many of them wailing and sobbing, watched as rescue workers shifted corpses charred beyond recognition from the site of Sunday's inferno to pyres at a nearby cremation ground.</p>
<p>The inferno erupted on the last day of a convention dedicated to a Hindu guru in Baripada, about 175 km (110 miles) southwest of Calcutta.</p>
<p>The flames, fanned by gusting winds, scorched the shelters for men devotees but spared a separate section for women and children. The cause of the fire was thought to be an electrical spark that quickly ignited huts covered in dry straw.</p>
<p>&quot;There was hardly any time to escape as the fire burnt down the camp within three minutes,&quot; said 27-year-old Dilip Kumar Mohapatra, who was recovering in a Cuttack hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a near-stampede because everyone was trying to get out of the only gate.&quot;</p>
<p>Priests on Monday chanted hymns in accordance with Hindu funeral rites as bodies piled five to a pyre burned on the banks of the River Burhabalanga.</p>
<p>Authorities said they had identified only 71 of 168 bodies found in the debris of the fire that engulfed makeshift bamboo and straw shelters at a camp site in Baripada, 220 km (135 miles) north of the capital of Orissa state, Bhubaneshwar.</p>
<p>Authorities said 32 of 187 injured had died in hospital.</p>
<p>Panicked survivors searched for missing relatives.</p>
<p>&quot;Where can he be? The authorities must be hiding bodies from us,&quot; said a distraught man who had travelled to Baripada from Bhubaneshwar to search for his missing father-in-law.</p>
<p>&quot;Women searched frantically because they did not know if their male relatives were alive,&quot; said P.K. Barik, a 46-year-old devotee who survived Sunday's blaze and was recovering in a hospital in nearby Cuttack town.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda flew to the spot, a football ground that was once the cremation site for the ruler of the region, the Maharaja of Mayurbhanj, who died on February 22, 1912 -- 85 years and one day before Sunday's fire.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda announced federal payments of 50,000 rupees ($1,400) to the victims' families and 25,000 rupees ($700) to the injured. The aid came on top of state payments of 25,000 rupees to the families of the deceased and 10,000 rupees to the injured.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda said the federal government would open discussions with religious leaders about ways to prevent a repeat of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Some officials said the blaze highlighted a disregard for fire safety in India, which has no federal fire regulations.</p>
<p>&quot;It is kind of a casual approach, lack of accountability and no regard for safety,&quot; P.S. Das, additional director general of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), told Reuters in the capital New Delhi. BIS sets national technical standards.</p>
<p>The BIS has recommended rules but the 26 states are free to adopt or reject them.</p>
<p>The state government launched an inquiry into what is believed to be the deadliest fire in India since December 1995 when about 425 people died in flames and smoke that ngulfed a school prizegiving ceremony in the northern town of Dabwali.</p>
