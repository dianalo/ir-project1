<title>USA: NYCE cotton ends barely down on producer selling.</title>
<headline>NYCE cotton ends barely down on producer selling.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Producer selling at the highs limited this week's rally of NYCE cotton futures and pushed the benchmark March contract slightly below unchanged by the close.</p>
<p>Dealers said trade selling emerged at 75.00 cents a lb in March, and local selling added pressure to the downward slide.</p>
<p>Fund shortcovering sparked early gains and lifted benchmark March to a high of 75.25 cents, traders said. The contract ended off 0.05 at 74.60 cents after trading from 75.25 to 74.35 cents.</p>
<p>The back months settled 0.25 lower to 0.23 firmer.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 18,000 lots.</p>
<p>Resistance was seen at 75.00 for March cotton, under which steady trade selling is expected to pressure the March contract, and support at 73.00 cents.</p>
<p>The market brushed off bullish reports by USDA and U.S. Census Bureau as the data had already been built into prices earlier this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The reports were close enough to what was expected that we can't attribute them to (early) gains,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>USDA put new sales in the 1996/97 crop at 221,000 lots, for the week ended Jan 16.</p>
<p>Census Bureau reported December mill consumption at 849,786 bales, or 10,322,212 bales in 1996. These numbers compare with 800,605 bales for December 1995 and 10,409,286 bales in 1995.</p>
