<p>Beijing, accusing UNESCO of meddling in its internal affairs for honouring a jailed Chinese journalist, has broken off several joint projects with the U.N. body in protest, diplomatic sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said China sent a note protesting against a press freedom award to jailed Chinese journalist Gao Yu and announcing cancellation of a speech at UNESCO headquarters by China's education minister as well as of plans for Chinese participation in UNESCO conferences and meetings in July and September.</p>
<p>China also suspended a cooperation agreement between UNESCO and China's central radio station and indefinitely postponed plans by unspecified top UNESCO officials to visit China, the sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an action of gross interference in the internal affairs of a member state...and the Chinese side is obliged to make strong reactions,&quot; said the protest note, which was delivered to UNESCO last week, according to the sources.</p>
<p>An official of China's UNESCO delegation did not deny the contents of the diplomatic note but declined to release a copy.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman at the Paris headquarters of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation had no comment, saying the note was a private communication.</p>
<p>Ironically, UNESCO director-general Federico Mayor has been battling to free UNESCO from an image as a press censor, gained in the early 1980s when then-director general Amadou Mahtar M'Bow sought to impose a &quot;new world information order&quot; boosting the role of government-controlled news media.</p>
<p>M'Bow's efforts were cited by the United States and Britain as part of the reason why they left UNESCO in 1985, complaining of wasted resources and excessive politicisation of the international organisation.</p>
<p>London's new Labour government recently announced plans to return to UNESCO.</p>
<p>Gao was arrested in 1989 after the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>She was released after 14 months of detention without trial but was re-arrested in 1994 on the eve of her planned departure to the United States to attend Columbia University.</p>
<p>She was jailed later that year after a secret trial, on charges of passing state secrets to foreigners.</p>
<p>China has said her case has nothing whatever to do with press freedom.</p>
<p>Mayor formally announced Gao's award at a World Press Freedom Day ceremony in Bilbao, Spain on May 3.</p>
<p>A few days later, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry warned that the prize would harm Beijing's cooperation with the organisation, but offered no details.</p>
<p>China's UNESCO delegate Zhang Chongli, addressing the UNESCO executive board last week, renewed criticism of the award but did not mention the Chinese actions spelled out in the written note.</p>
<p>Mayor, in later remarks to the executive board, defended the award while stressing the need for good relations with China.</p>
<p>The award, honouring &quot;people or institutions that have made a notable contribution to press freedom, independence and pluralism&quot;, was decided by a panel comprised primarily of journalists and editors, he noted.</p>
