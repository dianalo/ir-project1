<p>Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said on Tuesday Bulgaria expected its tobacco output to double to 80,000 tonnes this year, compared to 39,790 tonnes in 1996 and a record low output of 25,000 tonnes two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;This year's tobacco output, expected to be at about 80,000 tonnes, shows that people are restoring their interest in tobacco growing,&quot; Kostov told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said that encouraging purchase prices and incentives provided to farmers had boosted interest of private tobacco growers and added that new purchase prices, to be introduced by the cabinet this month, would be even more favourable.</p>
<p>&quot;These people would be able to come back to their means of livelihood again,&quot; said Kostov</p>
<p>Bulgaria's tobacco industry provides a livelihood for some 800,000 people, mainly ethnic Turks, or some 10 percent of the country's population.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when tobacco production in the Balkan country hit a record low, unfavourable weather conditions and low purchase prices forced the poverty-stricken population in tobacco growing areas to switch to other activities.</p>
<p>Under the current scheme, purchase prices of tobacco are updated twice annually in line with inflation -- in mid-July and mid-October. Private growers also qualify for additional payments from the state Tobacco Fund.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, when tobacco output was between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes annually, Bulgaria exported some 40,000 tonnes of tobacco to the former Soviet Union and only some 10,000 to western buyers.</p>
<p>Since the collapse of Eastern bloc trade links, Bulgaria's tobacco exports have started going mainly to French, German and U.S. companies. -- Sofia Newsroom +359-2 981 4145</p>
