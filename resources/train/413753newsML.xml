<p>The parents of dead and missing Belgian children will publish a magazine dedicated to keeping alive an investigation into the authorities' handling of child sex abuse and murder cases.</p>
<p>Patrick van Alphen, the editor designate, said in interviews published and broadcast on Sunday that the parents wanted the journal to keep a public probe of the police and justice authorities' handling of the cases going.</p>
<p>&quot;Every major movement needs its own mouthpiece,&quot; van Alphen told Belgian radio.</p>
<p>The issue has shaken Belgium's political establishment and prompted public outrage, with hundreds of thousands of protestors taking to the streets.</p>
<p>The parents of the murdered, missing or abused children also wanted to ensure their cause would continue to get the media attention it deserved, van Alphen said.</p>
<p>Led by the Russo and Lejeune families, whose eight-year-old girls Julie and Melissa died at the hands of a gang led by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux, the parents aim to launch the 20 franc ($0.60) magazine on March 15.</p>
<p>Van Alphen said the magazine would try to keep alive a public investigation, currently carried out by a parliamentary commission.</p>
<p>The Dutroux scandal erupted in August when first two sexually abused girls were rescued from a Dutroux house. Later the bodies of four others were found.</p>
<p>The authorities fear at least six other missing girls have been murdered by the gang.</p>
<p>In the course of the current investigation it became clear that various police forces had failed to coordinate their actions.</p>
<p>It also emerged that police had sloppily conducted investigations and searches. There were allegations of high-level police protection for Dutroux and his gang members -- allegations that are still being investigated.</p>
<p>Last year's revelations caused public outrage, culminating in a October 20 march in Brussels by 300,000 people voicing their lack of confidence in the law and order system.</p>
<p>The demonstration, dubbed the White March, has given its name to the magazine which will have articles written mainly by volunteers in Dutch and French.</p>
<p>The publication date coincides with the end of the mandate of so-called Dutroux commission and the magazine will &quot;try to keep the movement going which saw the light on October 20, try to find a listening ear,&quot; Van Alphen said.</p>
<p>The parents have repeatedly complained about the lack of openness and sympathy from the authorities who, they said, paid more attention to the criminals than to the victim.</p>
<p>&quot;The (White March) magazine is for all those people who have been turned away by the administration,&quot; Van Alphen said.</p>
