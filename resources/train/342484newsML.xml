<p>Shanghai's economy, which grew 13 percent last year, is likely to see slower growth in 1997, falling to perhaps 12 percent, the head of the city's statistical bureau said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate for Shanghai in 1997 is likely to differ from that of 1996 by around one percentage point, and from current conditions, it would appear more likely to be down rather than up,&quot; Sun said.</p>
<p>&quot;Shanghai's economy has been growing at more than 14 percent a year since 1992. That's fast enough,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said he expected Shanghai's GDP growth rate to stabilise and fall gradually in the next few years.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, if everyone does good work, then we could see an increase,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Previously published figures give Shanghai's GDP for 1996 as 287 billion yuan, a rise of 13 percent on 1995.</p>
