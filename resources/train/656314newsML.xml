<title>BURMA: Japan envoy to convey aid conditions to Burma.</title>

<p>A visiting Japanese envoy will remind Burma that normalising aid flows will depend on the military government's easing of restrictions on opposition activities in the country, a Japanese diplomat said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Japan's ambassador to Rangoon, Yoichi Yamaguchi, said envoy Hiroshi Hirabayashi would convey Tokyo's position on aid when he meets Secretary One of Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Political analysts said Hirabayashi's visit might help improve Burmese-Japanese ties, which have been strained since Tokyo froze all aid except debt relief grants to Burma after the military crushed pro-democracy protests in 1988.</p>
<p>Yamaguchi said Hirabayashi, Japan's cabinet chief councillor for external affairs, would also discuss Burma's pending membership in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in late July.</p>
<p>&quot;Aid resumption will go ahead in conformity with the development of the democratisation process,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hirabayashi met Burmese Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw on Thursday after arriving on Wednesday for a three-day visit. Japan has long urged the SLORC to engage in dialogue with the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>The military government has kept a tight lid on the party's activities.</p>
<p>Burmese analysts said the SLORC showed no sign of budging from its policy of not negotiating with the NLD while it was led by Suu Kyi. The party won a landslide election victory in 1990 but SLORC refused to recognise the result.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing and nobody can force the SLORC to sit at the negotiating table with the NLD if it is led by Suu Kyi,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;If Suu Kyi is not included, it may be another case. Holding dialogue with the NLD without Suu Kyi might be acceptable to SLORC but it is something the NLD won't do.&quot; The analyst said Rangoon would express its appreciation that Japan had not followed the United States in imposing economic sanctions on the country.</p>
<p>Washington, citing &quot;severe repression&quot; in Burma, imposed the sanctions last month over the SLORC's human rights record and treatment of democracy activists.</p>
