<p>Hand grenades damaged several cars at a dealership in the Hungarian capital Budapest as a gangland war continued unchecked, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said witnesses saw one or two men running away after the attack on Monday night.</p>
<p>No one was injured, but police said at least one or two hand grenades had not exploded and they closed the road outside the car firm to conduct a search. A forensics team searched the lot shortly after 8 a.m. but appeared to find nothing.</p>
<p>Residents of the city of two million people are becoming alarmed by the rash of hand grenade attacks, petrol bombings and shootings which has escalated since it began in September</p>
<p>Police have admitted receiving little cooperation from victims.</p>
<p>The owner of the car dealership, interviewed by reporters, declined to give his name and added, &quot;I don't know anything about this.&quot;</p>
<p>State radio quoted the new national police chief, Attila Bertha, as saying he expected there to be more bombings &quot;because this is a mafia war associated with the development of society&quot;.</p>
<p>The attacks have mostly been aimed at restaurants, night clubs and car dealerships, usually after closing hours, but last Friday the wife and daughter of a Chinese restaurant owner were killed by a hand grenade left in the restaurant's toilet.</p>
<p>&quot;What can I say? I could be the next one,&quot; said Andras Donko, owner of a auto repair garage opposite the car dealership.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, firefighters were called out to extinguish a blaze started by petrol bombs lobbed into the garden of a Greek restaurant. The firemen removed gas canisters which officials said could have caused a major explosion.</p>
<p>So far, the crime wave has had no effect on Hungary's vital tourist industry, but diplomats said the government is becoming increasingly worried.</p>
<p>&quot;This has become a really high priority for the government,&quot; a diplomat said. &quot;They are putting a lot of effort into it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it's an uphill battle,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;There's so much money floating around.&quot;</p>
