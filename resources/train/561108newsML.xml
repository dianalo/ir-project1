<p>British police battled hundreds of rioters for more than two hours overnight before restoring order in the eastern English city of Scunthorpe, the Press Association news agency reported on Monday.</p>
<p>At least 19 people were arrested and two were taken to hospital with injuries, the agency said.</p>
<p>Police had to call in reinforcements from surrounding areas when they came under attack from the rioters.</p>
<p>&quot;The police officers found themselves under attack from bottles, coins and similar missiles,&quot; a police spokeswoman was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;In the course of the disturbance a police car was overturned and set on fire,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The Press Association said the trouble started in a fast-food shop in the city centre on Sunday night and spread when revellers from a nearby nightclub joined in.</p>
<p>Police said the cause of the rioting was unclear and an investigation was being launched.</p>
