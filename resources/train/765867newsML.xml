<title>RUSSIA: Blast kills three in centre of Chechen capital.</title>
<headline>Blast kills three in centre of Chechen capital.</headline>
<dateline>GROZNY 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>At least three people died on Wednesday when their vehicle exploded in the centre of Grozny, capital of Russia's breakaway Chechnya region.</p>
<p>A Reuters correspondent saw the charred bodies of three men inside a minibus which had been ripped open and overturned by a powerful explosion near the headquarters of a hardline guerrilla leader. A woman passerby was also wounded.</p>
<p>Police were investigating and declined to comment.</p>
<p>The car, with registration plates of neighbouring Dagestan, was parked close to the headquarters of Salman Raduyev, a hardline rebel fighter who has refused to recognise a peace deal struck last August between Russia and Chechnya.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Raduyev had left the building about fifteen minutes before the explosion.</p>
<p>The unruly Chechen guerilla commander raided the neighbouring ethnic republic of Dagestan in January 1996, held hundreds of hostages there and later escaped safely though the lines of Russian commandos.</p>
<p>Raduyev has survived a number of assasination attempts.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people were killed in a 21-month war between local separatists and Russian troops which ended in August with agreement on a Russian withdrawal.</p>
