<p>The U.N.'s food aid agency called for large-scale emergency aid to North Korea on Monday to prevent a famine that could turn into &quot;one of the biggest humanitarian disasters of our lifetime&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The countdown to famine has begun,&quot; Catherine Bertini, executive director of the Rome-based World Food Progamme, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The window of opportunity to avert famine is rapidly closing and could already have closed. The real issue facing us is not whether there will be famine but how many people will actually die,&quot; Bertini said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the suffering has already begun in some parts of the country where we have already detected serious malnourishment among children,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The WFP launched a $95.5 million appeal earlier this month to purchase and deliver 203,000 tonnes of emergency food to North Korea, where unprecedented flooding in 1995/96 devastated entire cereal crops.</p>
<p>But the agency said on Monday that it had received just one third of the money requested and estimated North Korea needed 1.3 million tonnes of additional food to meet its basic needs in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Potentially, if the situation remains unchecked, we could be looking at one of the biggest humanitarian disasters of our lifetime,&quot; Bertini said.</p>
<p>She called on the international community to increase aid contributions to the WFP's emergency fund before it was too late to stop a crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to realistically make up the enormous shortfall is through large-scale and direct aid,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>North Korean authorities have said their food supplies will run out at the end of April. The WFP estimated there was only enough food to feed the country until June.</p>
<p>&quot;After that, the country's 24 million people will have to wait until the next harvest in October and November,&quot; a statement said.</p>
<p>The United States recently delivered $25 million in food aid to North Korea but has refused to pledge further assistance or lift trade sanctions against Pyongyang's communist leadership until it agrees to proposed four-nation peace talks.</p>
<p>Negotiations on the peace talks, which would also include South Korea and China, were stalled earlier this month when representatives from the North tied progress to further large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>The political war of nerves between North Korea's Stalinist regime and South Korea has also restricted the effectiveness of humanitarian missions.</p>
<p>On Monday, the North Korean Red Cross rejected a proposal by its Southern counterpart that talks on speeding up food aid be held on the heavily fortified border between the two countries.</p>
<p>Repeated appeals for help have drawn only a lukewarm response from other international donor countries amid fears that the food aid will go to Pyongyang's isolationist military regime.</p>
