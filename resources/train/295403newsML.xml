<p>A late snowfall saved a World Cup cross-country skiing event scheduled to start on Saturday at the course which will be used at next year's Nagano Olympics.</p>
<p>Snow began falling late on Sunday after Japanese self-defence troops aided by hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend hauling snow to the course located outside the village of Hakuba in the Japanese Alps.</p>
<p>By late Tuesday, the course where cross-country skiers will compete for Olympic glory next February was covered with about 70 centimetres of snow. The course was opened for training only a day behind schedule.</p>
<p>Hakuba will also host Olympic ski jumping and the men's and women's downhill and super giant slalom events.</p>
<p>Nagano, about 30 kilometres east of Hakuba, was blanketed by the same snowfall.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not so concerned about lack of snow for the Olympics,&quot; said Kazutoshi Furusaka, director of Olympic venue management. &quot;This time of year it is not unusual to have no snow. By the middle of February, there is lots of snow.&quot;</p>
<p>About 200 self-defence troops used a fleet of 25 trucks to bring 3,000 cubic metres of snow from north-facing slopes located about five kilometres from the course.</p>
<p>More than 400 Hakuba residents, village officials and Olympic staff helped deliver and pack the snow.</p>
<p>In an earlier attempt to save the event, organisers hired transporters in late December to haul more than 350 truckloads of snow to the course, but efforts were interrupted by the Japanese New Year holiday.</p>
<p>Bjorn Dahlie, defending World Cup champion and four times Olympic gold medalist, called the course the most demanding he has tested.</p>
<p>&quot;The uphills are long and the downhills are fast and difficult,&quot; said the Norwegian. &quot;It will be the best racers who will win on this type of track.&quot;</p>
<p>About 130 skiers from 22 countries are expected to take part in the competition, which includes women's five-km and men's 10-km individual events on Saturday and women's 10-km and men's 15-km pursuit races on Sunday.</p>
