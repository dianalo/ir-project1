<p>At least eight Christians were killed and five others wounded when suspected Moslem militants attacked a church in southern Egypt on Wednesday, security sources and the interior ministry said.</p>
<p>The  sources said  the gunmen -- believed to be members of the militant Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) -- stormed the church in Abu Qurqas town, some 200 km (125 miles) south of Cairo, killing seven youths and wounding five others. Another man was killed while the gunmen were escaping.</p>
<p>In Cairo, the interior ministry said in a statement the attackers shot dead nine Christians and wounded six others when they sprayed the exterior of the church with machinegun fire.</p>
<p>Moslem militants have in the past five years targeted and killed members of the minority Christian population while trying to transform Egypt into a purist Islamic state.</p>
<p>But the sources said  this was the first time suspected militant groups actually stormed a church and killed worshippers there.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people have been killed and scores more wounded since the Gama'a and other organisations started their armed struggle in 1992 to overthrow the current government.</p>
<p>These groups have attacked policemen, tourists and government officials but security crackdowns have largely limited their activities to the south.</p>
