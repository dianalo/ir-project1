<p>Former senior Israeli security men on Saturday slammmed the Jewish state's recent treatment of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and his security chiefs over curbing militants.</p>
<p>Both criticised public statements by Israeli security chiefs and army officers against the Palestinians in the wake of an Islamist suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, saying if there was a problem it should have been quietly addressed in meetings.</p>
<p>They added that the political echelon could choose to publicly cast accusations at the Palestinian Authority or warn &quot;day after day&quot; of possible guerrilla attacks but said the military should not be dragged into making such statements.</p>
<p>Danny Rothschild, former military coordinator of Israeli activities in the occupied areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip who attended peace talks with the Palestinians in that capacity, told Israel's Channel One Television:</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt that Arafat has the preventive ability and we have to demand he use it so that there will not be more terror attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;But on the other side, it is necessary to continue to speak to him and to speak to him as an equal, not by dictates.</p>
<p>&quot;If that isn't done, there is a break, this break leads to misunderstandings, these misunderstandings lead to attacks and the process itself is in danger.&quot;</p>
<p>Karmi Gilon, who resigned as head of Israel's Shin Bet secret service after the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak by a right-wing Jew, said he and Rabin had met quietly with Palestinian security heads after attacks in the past and the strategy was effective. He added:</p>
<p>&quot;It has also happened not once that Arafat was attacked in the past, and heavy responsibility put on him for attacks, and in the end it turned out that we were the ones that did not prevent it or did not succeed in preventing them.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinian-Israeli peace moves plunged into crisis this month after Israel broke ground for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem and after the bombing in Tel Aviv that killed three Israelis a week ago.</p>
<p>Palestinians have clashed for 10 consecutive days with Israeli troops over the settlement. On Saturday, soldiers killed a Palestinian, the first fatality since the unrest began.</p>
<p>Israel says Arafat gave militants the impression they had a green light for attacks. The Authority denies the charge.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after meeting U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross on Friday demanded Arafat arrest militants, dismantle guerrilla groups and tighten cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces.</p>
