<title>USA: U.S. would consider new North Korea food appeal.</title>
<headline>U.S. would consider new North Korea food appeal.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-08-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United States said on Monday it would look favourably on another World Food Programme request for North Korea food aid, but another appeal was not expected soon.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman James Rubin said the U.N. agency is &quot;somewhat oversubscribed&quot; from its last appeal but &quot;if there was such an appeal, we would take a good, hard look at it. And we have a very good record in this regard.&quot;</p>
<p>He spoke after North Korea complained through its official media that the U.S. position at a meeting in New York last week was that food aid can be expanded only after four-nation peace talks are launched.</p>
<p>Pyongyang accused Washington of using food as a political weapon.</p>
<p>The U.S. position is that it does not make humanitarian food aid conditional on the political issue of peace talks and Rubin reiterated that view on Monday.</p>
<p>But officials have long said privately that while the United States has and will respond to limited food aid appeals, any major effort to deal with North Korea's food shortages -- like providing fertilisers and related items -- would have to be discussed within the context of peace talks.</p>
<p>The United States has become a major donor to North Korea, providing $52 million in food aid through the World Food Programme in 1997 and a total of $60.4 million since 1995.</p>
<p>North Korea, according to experts, is suffering a famine due to shortages caused by several years of flooding and now a drought.</p>
<p>Pyongyang's negotiators have repeatedly raised the Stalinist regime's food needs during prepatory discussions related to U.S. and South Korean efforts to launch peace talks also involving North Korea and China.</p>
<p>The aim is to replace the fraying armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War with a permanent peace arrangement.</p>
<p>Prepatory talks to settle procedural issues related to formal peace talks were held in New York last week but ended without final agreement. They are to resume on Sept. 15.</p>
<p>North Korea on Sunday called the New York talks disappointing.</p>
<p>It said through a spokesman that peace talks should not cover the internal affairs of North Korea, but issues which include a peace agreement between the United States and North Korea and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>On Friday, the United States said a &quot;significant&quot; disagreement was over whether the peace talks agenda should be specific or general, and said it does not want to negotiate a U.S. withdrawal of troops from the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>Contrary to Pyongyang's view, Rubin said the United States was &quot;quite pleased with what happened in New York last week.&quot;</p>
<p>Elaborating on the agenda row, he said Washington wants the talks &quot;to be about stability, about security, about confidence-building measures (and) are prepared to talk about the reasons why we have deployed so many American soldiers to defend our South Korean allies.&quot;</p>
<p>But if proposals that are &quot;clearly non-starters&quot; -- like withdrawal of U.S. forces -- are included in the agenda &quot;we are just going to create a prescription for the talks bogging down later,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rubin expresed hope that North Korean negotiators will  get new instructions from Pyongyang that will resolve the impasse.</p>
