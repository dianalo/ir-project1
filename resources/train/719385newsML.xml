<p>Stocks were mixed Thursday as the market consolidated while focusing on corporate earnings reports.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT/1700 GMT, the Dow was up 13.12 points at 7,855.55.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 14-11 on active volume of 310 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index slipped 2.01 points to 1,484.62.</p>
<p>Analysts said stocks reached such high levels that they were the target of profit-taking in the absence of fresh economic data.</p>
<p>Earnings results set the direction of individual stocks, as investors rotated among sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is edgy,&quot; said Dick Stein, vice president of U.S. Clearing Corp. &quot;There are a lot of people out there with nice, big profits who are quick to pull the trigger.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury bond was off 5/32, or $1.56 on a $1,000 bond, which lifted its yield to 6.58 percent from 6.56 percent Wednesday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>&quot;Valuations have gotten so high that we need really positive news to get people buying aggressively,&quot; said Roy Blumberg, chief investment strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross. &quot;A backup in bonds and some nervous after the stock market's recent volatility is enough to send shares lower.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors were busily rotating among groups, using earnings results and valuations to guide their actions, traders said.</p>
<p>Technology stocks lost steam after some below-forecast earnings reports, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nasdaq has been closing at new record highs every day, so it is subject to profit-taking as the earnings come out,&quot; said Jim Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage. &quot;It's a question of stock selection here.&quot;</p>
<p>Intel Corp., a recent gainer, shed 1-7/8 to 150-3/4 in active trade, setting a softer tone for the broader technology market.</p>
<p>Compaq Computer Corp. also weakened 1-1/8 to 120, after the company reported quarterly earnings that were above analysts' expectations but stood below the so-called &quot;whisper&quot; estimate.</p>
<p>The &quot;whisper&quot; number refers to unpublished earnings estimates that circulate on Wall Street ahead of earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;The market cannot tolerate anything but really fantastic news,&quot; said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital.</p>
<p>Kmart Corp. lost 3/4 to 10-3/4. The retailer said markdowns in its women's apparel business would keep its second-quarter net income below its year-ago profit levels.</p>
