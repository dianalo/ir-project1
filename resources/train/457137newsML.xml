<p>The problems for Russia's new economic supremo, Anatoly Chubais, are more serious than many investors believe, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Oaul Luke said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chubais must address both the foreign investment regime and the banking system, he said in a research report.</p>
<p>&quot;Too many investors see the challenges facing Chubais as incremental rather than fundamental...The feeling exists that all Chubais has to do is build on what has been achieved and Russia will be as hunky dorey as can be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There has been progress, such as the sharp drop in inflation and the fact the bulk of the economy is in private hands.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) a look at Russia's external accounts in 1996 shows that Russia is in much deeper doo-doo than the incrementalists believe,&quot; Luke said.</p>
<p>Though the trade account was fine, foreign direct investment last year was a mere $2.2 billion, which was less than Peru.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia's external debt rose and international reserves fell.</p>
<p>&quot;Although some of these outflows may be legitimate, for example giving trade credit, the number is a pretty good proxy for a fundamental problem facing Russia: capital flight.&quot;</p>
<p>There is a danger Russia will end up relying too much on short-term debt to finance its development, he said.</p>
<p>Though the amount of debt is relatively small, the quality is beginning to be a worry. Short-term debt now represents 115 percent of international reserves.</p>
<p>Chubais should make the most of friendly markets to improve Russia's debt profile this year and augment the climate for long-term equity investment, Luke said.</p>
<p>Another major concern is Russia's banking system where retstructuring has barely started.</p>
<p>One solution to Russia's banking problems would be to allow in more foreign banks.</p>
<p>A benign global liquidity environment is also helping Russian banks behave more like hedge funds than intermediators of savings, Luke added.</p>
<p>The banks' rapid acquisition of government paper and equities will not be a problem if the current environment remains.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, failure to meet at least half of Russia's fiscal deficit from foreign sources will, barring a big inflow of foreign direct investment and a renaissance of popular confience in the banks, lead to some pretty severe problems,&quot; Luke said.</p>
