<p>Barrick Gold Corp said on Tuesday that it was in talks with mining officials regarding a concession in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but that nothing had been decided.</p>
<p>Laurent Kabila's government said earlier today that Barrick's lease was one of several old contracts under review.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been in discussions with them in the last few weeks and those discussions have not resulted in anything yet,&quot; Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The Barrick mining concession, which was negotiated under ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko, covers an area of over 80,000 sq km near Bunia in the northeastern corner of the former Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with Barrick is that we still have to sort out the lease. We are still making proposals and waiting for a response,&quot; Minister of Mines Matukulo Kambale told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He did not say what changes to the lease the government was seeking.</p>
<p>Barrick acquired the lease last summer, but it halted its exploration activities when the civil war intensified.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a basic exploration property. We have not done detailed exploration work yet to know how prospective it is,&quot; Borg said.</p>
<p>Kambale said a preliminary deal for gold exploration had been signed on Tuesday with Russell Resources Group over a large area near Bunia. He did not say whether it overlapped with the Barrick concession.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not good to have very huge concessions in the hands of one company. It is better for more companies to have a chance,&quot; Kambale said.</p>
<p>Borg said he did not know if Barrick's representatives had been asked to give up part of the concession.</p>
