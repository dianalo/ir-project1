<p>Asian regional currencies sent reeling by speculator attacks are generally seen weakening further this year, a Reuter poll of 14 currency experts worldwide showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The poll was carried out after the Malaysian central bank stood aside on Monday and let the ringgit slide because of persistent pressure on the currency following the de facto devaluations of the Thai baht and Philippine peso.</p>
<p>The poll showed the Thai baht has further to fall with the average of forecasts pointing to the dollar rising to 31.62 baht, about 5.5 percent higher than its current level. Forecasts for dollar/baht ranged from 28.25 to 35.00.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the baht has to be the one doing the most work,&quot; said Kobus van der Wath, regional head of treasury economics at Standard Chartered in Singapore.</p>
<p>Also vulnerable is the Philippine peso, seen weakening to 28.65 per U.S. dollar by the year end -- a 2.3 percent rise in dollar/peso from current levels.</p>
<p>However, the bulk of the forecasts were on the higher side with a low forecast of 26.50 standing out amid 11 for around 28.00 and one of 32.00.</p>
<p>The Malaysian ringgit was seen easing slightly to 2.5879, a rise of around a 1.0 percent in the dollar/ringgit rate from current levels.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Indonesia rupiah is seen weakening only slightly to 2481.00, a rise of around 1.3 percent in dollar/rupiah. The rupiah is anyway the subject of a managed depreciation by the Indonesian government.</p>
<p>&quot;The rupiah has done the work over the past several years and if you look at purchasing power parity (PPP) level it is actually more than 10 percent undervalued, It's almost the total opposite of the others,&quot; Standard's van der Wath said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the ringgit was slightly overvalued, but at current levels that was academic.</p>
<p>According to PPP principles, the peso was highly overvalued and second to that Thailand.</p>
<p>&quot;Given what's happened you could say we're are pretty much at equilibrium levels but the bias is clearly for people wanting to be long of dollars if they can be,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
