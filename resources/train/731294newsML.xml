<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended broadly lower on Wednesday, as local and light speculative long liquidation wiped away all the previous day's gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said the market appeared to biding its time until some fresh fundamental input emerged, with prices seen bouncing around in range between $1,570 and $1,600 a tonne basis September.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is pathetic right now,&quot; said one trader. &quot;There's no volume, it's all locals -- the trade isn't really doing anything -- and it's stuck in a range.&quot;</p>
<p>Benchmark September fell $19 tonne on the day, to $1,576, after ranging from $1,591 to $1,570. Spot July, which expired today, ended $12 lower, at $1,571, while the remaining months finished down $16 to $18.</p>
<p>Local and speculative liquidation pressured the market from the outset on Wednesday. But light scale-down trade buying stemmed the downslide and kept the benchmark September contract from breaching chart support at $1,570-$1,565 a tonne, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade is buying on dips, but they are not buying much,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;They are just supporting the bottom end of the range.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, traders said September will continue to face some support at $1,570 down to $1,565, with the next level seen at $1,545. Resistance was pegged at $1,600, followed by $1,610.</p>
<p>Traders are hoping the U.S. second quarter grind figures due out on Friday at 0845 EDT, will help the market get out of its recent doldrums.</p>
<p>Most analysts expected the U.S. second quarter grind to rise by five to 10 percent compared with the same year-ago period, although estimates ranged from a five-percent decrease to a 15-percent increase.</p>
<p>In 1996, U.S. second quarter grindings rose by 4.85 percent to 82,713 tonnes against a revised 78,886 tonnes in the 1995 second quarter. In the first quarter of 1997,  grindings surged 20.74 percent to 95,435 tonnes versus the same year-ago period.</p>
<p>The day's volume reached an estimated 5,426 lots.</p>
