<p>Sumitomo Chemical Co Ltd and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc will merge their polystyrene business to make the second-largest polystyrene company in Japan, business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said in its Monday edition.</p>
<p>Neither company was immediately available for comment on the report.  </p>
<p>Nihon Keizai said the two chemical firms would form a joint venture to which they would each transfer production, sales rights, and research and development functions by October.</p>
<p>The venture will have an annual production capacity of 225,000 tonnes and will become Japan's second-largest polystyrene company after Asahi Chemical Industry Co Ltd, the paper said.</p>
<p>Polystyrene is used for a variety of products including electrical appliances and wrapping materials.</p>
<p>It is rare in Japan for companies in different giant business groups merge operations, and the move will speed up the restructuring of Japan's chemical industry, the paper said.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Chemical is a member of the Sumitomo group and Mitsui Toatsu a member of the Mitsui group.  </p>
<p>The merger of Mitsui Toatsu and Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd, expected in October, helped Sumitomo Chemical and Mitsui Toatsu to agree to the polystyrene merger, as Mitsui Toatsu needed to restructure its unprofitable polystyrene business, Nihon Keizai said.</p>
<p>Mitsui Petrochemicalhas already tied up with Sumitomo Chemical in polystyrene business and served as a go-between to bring Sumitomo and Mitsui Toatsu together, the paper said.</p>
<p>Sumitomo is also losing money in its polystyrene operations, the paper said.</p>
<p>The joint firm will be capitalised at about two billion yen and will be equally owned by the two companies, the paper said. The new firm's facilities will include Mitsui Toatsu's plant in Osaka in western Japan and Sumitomo Chemical's plant in Chiba, near Tokyo, it said.</p>
