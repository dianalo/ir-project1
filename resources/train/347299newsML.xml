<p>Costs of repairing damage at Yosemite National Park from devastating floods the West suffered in December and January may run as high as $178 million, the Interior Department said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are committed to reopening the park as quickly as possible. Emergency repairs are underway to stabilise the infrastructure, but the long term fix will take time,&quot; Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in a statement.</p>
<p>With 10 weeks of winter and the annual spring runoff still ahead, the Interior Department released an estimate of damage so far to structures including roads, sewers, water wells, campsites, lodging units and employee housing.</p>
<p>The Interior Department said damage estimates likely will rise as snow melts and crews can get into inaccessible areas.</p>
<p>Babbitt indicated he will ask Congress for money to help pay for repairs, saying he looked forward &quot;to working with Congress to gain the funding necessary for full recovery of the park.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the park in the California has been closed since Jan. 1, but heavy snow in the high country generally makes large portions of the park inaccessible in the winter.</p>
<p>Reservations to the park have been cancelled through February, but cross-country ski areas should open on Saturday.</p>
