<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bonds finished Friday's session underperforming the Treasury market but still managing 3/8 to 1/2 point gains.</p>
<p>The government long bond was up 25/32 at 96-12/32 in late New York trading to yield 6.91 percent.</p>
<p>Muni futures also lagged. The June municipal contract rose 10/32 to 117, while June T-bonds gained 23/32 to 110-1/32. The MOB spread narrowed to 223 ticks from 236 at the close on Thursday.</p>
<p>Low supply has been the predominant market force in recent weeks, and next week's calendar shows no signs of a major pick-up. Next week is expected to see $2.2 billion in 104 sales, up slightly from this week's $2 billion in 80 sales.</p>
<p>The negotiated calendar totals $1.6 billion, with a $160 million Philadelphia School District issue through Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. topping the list.</p>
<p>In competitive action, $618 million in 50 sales are expected.</p>
<p>A $200 million New York City general obligation sale on Tuesday is the largest.</p>
<p>In the muni secondary Friday, bids on Alliance Airport Authority, Texas, 6-3/8s of 2021 were unchanged at 101-1/2.</p>
<p>Jefferson County, Ala., FGIC sewer revenue bonds of 2027, which pay a 5-3/4 percent coupon, were bid at 99-1/2, up 1/4.</p>
