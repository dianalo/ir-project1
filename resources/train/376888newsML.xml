<p>European Commissioner Mario Monti said on Thursday that he saw no reason not to bring forward Italy's 1998 budget as a cautionary measure to boost confidence in its credentials as an aspiring founder member of EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion, caution dictates that nothing should be done to damage efforts to reach this goal,&quot; Monti told reporters after a news conference in Rome.</p>
<p>&quot;I remain convinced that...inserting the 1998 budget (into the framework of a three-year economic plan) as soon as it is technically possible would help promote among Italians and other countries, even in 1997, a better rooted conviction of the... stability and sustainability of the public finance results.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi have floated the idea of bringing forward the 1998 budget to August in order to underpin their determination to clean up public finances and achieve the Maastricht goals.</p>
<p>The budget must be drawn up by the end of September and passed into law by December 31.</p>
<p>But opposition centre-right leader Silvio Berlusconi said the government now appeared to be rowing back from the idea.</p>
<p>Government politicians said the options -- either a mini-budget in March and a 1998 budget on schedule, or an early 1998 budget and no mini-budget -- were still being reviewed.</p>
<p>Monti said Italy should continue to strive to achieve the criteria to join economic and monetary union from its planned start in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;If there should be the need for additional interventions to achieve the objectives set for 1997 with certainty...I would see no reason to delay them,&quot; he added.</p>
