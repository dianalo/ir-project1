<p>Continuing economic stability and rising purchasing power are keeping Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso high on the crest of unrivalled popularity, a poll showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The survey by Brazil's National Industry Confederation (CNI) gave Cardoso an approval rating of 70 percent, 10 percentage points up on February 1996, and showed he would win hands down with 46 percent of the vote if elections were held now.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures reinforce the view that Fernando Henrique Cardoso is enjoying his best moment,&quot; the CNI said in a synopsis of the survey results.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally, this must be due to the success of the Plano Real economic stability plan,&quot; said CNI President Senator Fernando Bezerra.</p>
<p>The so-called Plano Real, which combines tight monetary policy with a carefully controlled exchange rate, slashed 5,000-percent-a-year hyperinflation to just about 10 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Cardoso's reformist government says economic stability has lifted 13 million people above the poverty line since the plan was implemented 2-1/2 years ago though critics accuse Brasilia of failing to do enough for health and education.</p>
<p>The CNI survey, conducted between March 6-10, questioned 2,000 people across the country. Some 73 percent of respondents said 1996 had been an excellent or good year for them, while 75 percent expected 1997 to be good. The pollsters did not give the margin of error for their results.</p>
<p>The poll also showed increasing confidence in the Plano Real.</p>
<p>&quot;In contrast with previous plans, which started off with great credibility and gradually aroused distrust among the population, the Plano Real has been gaining more and more support from public opinion as time passes,&quot; the CNI said.</p>
<p>Whereas a year ago only 36 percent of Brazilians thought the plan would succeed, 46 percent now think it will hold. Eleven percent of those questioned this month expected it to fail against 17 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;This psychological factor is highly important in itself in ensuring stability,&quot; Bezerra told reporters.</p>
<p>Most interesting perhaps to Cardoso, and a certain cause for consternation among his foes, was the discovery that the current president would win more votes than all his opponents combined if a general election were held now.</p>
<p>The poll gave 46 percent support to Cardoso, who is pressing Congress to approve a constitutional amendment that would allow him to stand for a second consecutive term in 1998.</p>
<p>The closest challenger was likely opposition Workers Party (PT) candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with 13 percent of the ballot.</p>
