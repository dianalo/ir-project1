<headline>OPINION-Indonesian market outlook in June.</headline>

<p>JAKARTA, June 27 - Indonesia has been spared many of the problems associated with other regional markets and except, for Taiwan, has been the region's strongest performer so far this year, rising some 12 percent.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this relatively stronger performance, which has seen the JSE Composite Index return to within touching distance of its all time high.</p>
<p>The economy remains in good shape, with GDP growth of 7.6 percent forecast for this year, only marginally slower than 1996's 7.8 percent.</p>
<p>Earnings growth remains robust at close to 20 percent for each of 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the property sector, which has been the cause of many of the region's problems, while not in the rudest of health is in no worse situation than it was a year ago.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to note that property only plays a minor role in the Indonesia equity market, accounting for just eight percent of the market capitalisation.</p>
<p>POLITICAL CONCERNS</p>
<p>The only concern this year has been on the political front, with investors sidelined for much of the second quarter ahead of the parliamentary election.</p>
<p>While there was indeed some violence (over 200 people were killed -- mostly in either traffic accidents or a store fire in Kalimantan), the election itself threw up few surprises with the ruling Golkar faction winning handsomely and the market quickly rebounded.</p>
<p>However, with the election now behind us, there is little on the immediate horizon which is likely to propel the market higher.</p>
<p>Second quarter earnings, which will be published in late July and August, could turn out to be uninspiring.</p>
<p>In the consumer sector, there was some de-stocking at the retail level which will have affected manufacturers and distributors alike.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the banks saw reduced loan growth as borrowers moved to the sidelines until the political picture is clearer.</p>
<p>OUTLOOK FOR REST OF YEAR STEADY</p>
<p>The outlook for the remainder of the year is steady, if unspectacular.</p>
<p>On a FY97 PER of 15.3x, the market is not expensive, given prospective EPS growth this year of 20.2 percent followed by only a slightly slower 18.3 percent increase in 1998.</p>
<p>Several of the political questions that were with us two years ago are still with us today -- primarily that of the succession after President Suharto. This will again return to the surface in early 1998 at the time of the presidential election.</p>
<p>Although Suharto will undoubtedly stand again (and be duly re-elected), eyes will be focused on the vice-presidency for clues as to his eventual successor.</p>
<p>All of this is likely to keep the political risk premium high, limiting room for significant PER expansion.</p>
<p>At the start of this year we set a year-end target for the Index of 750 and we see no reason to change our view.</p>
<p>Given a current level of 708.5, this implies upside of about six percent from here. At this level, the market will be trading on a FY98 PER of 13.8x.</p>
<p>PREFERRED SECTORS REMAIN BANKS, CONSUMERS</p>
<p>Our preferred sectors remain the banks and (more selectively) the consumer sector.</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that deposit rates are unlikely to rise, both because expectations of higher U.S. rates have diminished and because the banking system, since the election, has regained its liquidity.</p>
<p>Margins will remain wide this year and, although loan growth at the bigger private banks will lag that of 1996 (when lending increased by up to 60 percent was recorded), they will nevertheless reap the benefit of 1996's new lending.</p>
<p>The infrastructure sector offers tremendous longer term growth prospects on the back of the rapid development of the economy and will be less affected by shorter term political conderations.</p>
<p>United Tractor offers tremendous exposure to the massive increase in elecricity generating capacity through its coal mines, while Telkom is expected to report 20 percent plus annual earnings growth as teledensity grows from a level currently amongst the lowest in Asia.</p>
<p>We continue to recommend that investors underweight the property sector.</p>
<p>Although the worst may be over, we see little reason for prices to recover while supply remains plentiful. At the same time, valuations of the companies, while not uncomfortably high, are not compellingly attractive.</p>
<p>The timber products sector -- pulp and paper and plywood companies -- looks set to go nowhere as long as commodity prices remain dull and we would also seek to reduce holdings here, particularly ahead of the Rp2 trillion rights issue from pulp giant Indah Kiat Pulp &amp; Paper.</p>
