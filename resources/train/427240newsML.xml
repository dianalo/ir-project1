<p>TI Group Plc is expected by analysts to show a solid performance when it reports 1996 results on Wednesday, but may have a cautionary tale to tell on the strength of sterling and the state of European car markets for the current year.</p>
<p>The engineered seals, tubing and aerospace group is expected to report a 14 percent increase in underlying pre-tax profits to 208-215 million stg from 184.8 million stg in 1995, with a further exceptional gain of around 22 million stg on disposals.</p>
<p>The final dividend is expected to be increased nine percent to 9.55 pence, making 14.3 pence for the year against 13.1p in 1995, on earnings of around 30 pence.</p>
<p>But the strong position of TI's Bundy division in  Europe making vehicle brake and fuel lines looks vulnerable to sterling's recent strength, and threatened cutbacks in production by the car manufacturers.</p>
<p>But the gloom there is likely to be relieved by an upturn in the aircraft manufacturing industry, which should revive growth in profits at Dowty Aerospace. The Dowty division includes one of the world's biggest manufacturers of aircraft landing gear, the Anglo-French joint-venture Messier-Dowty. &quot;The good news comes from the aerospace activities where they are well represented on a broad range of aircraft,&quot; said Tim Bennett, a London-based analyst at Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>&quot;(More) landing gear should have started to go out the door at the end of last year ahead of a pick-up in aircraft deliveries this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bennett is maintaining a &quot;neutral&quot; rating on the share but is mindful of the acquisitive company's long-running reputation for pleasant surprises.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel a lot of the good news is in the price,&quot; said Bennett. &quot;They are big in the French automotive industry -- the worst place in Europe to be this year because of the ending of (government) incentives (to buy new cars).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I am just waiting to see to what extent they can overcome that with what is otherwise quite a good outsourcing story that they have got in brake and fuel lines around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Down 9-1/2 540-1/2 p on Friday, TI's share price is off its year high of 593 touched last October, but still above the 488p level of a year ago.</p>
<p>On current market forecasts it is asking 15.45 times earnings for 1997, according to Reuters 3000 data based on estimates collated by Edinburgh Financial forecasting.</p>
