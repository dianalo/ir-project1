<headline>CME live, feeder cattle called .10 -.20 ct lower.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>CME live and feeder cattle futures were called mostly 0.10 to 0.20 cent per lb lower, with a few calls for steady, analysts said.</p>
<p>A week-long decline in cash beef prices plus slow feedlot cattle markets this week should attract more selling to the futures, analysts said. A few cattle traded Thursday at $65.00 per cwt in Plains feedlot markets, but unless more trade Friday analysts expect $64.00 bids next week.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, USDA quoted beef cutout values down $0.32 to $0.15 per cwt.</p>
<p>Also, some analysts said meat packers have a large number of contract cattle becoming available in June, which may lessen demand for them to make new purchases next week.  </p>
<p>Feeder cattle were called 0.10-0.20 cent per lb lower with pressure expected from lower cash feeder cattle prices, forecasts for higher corn prices and ideas the long-term uptrend in feeder cattle futures may be over.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was down $0.10 at $77.35 per cwt. CBOT corn futures were called two to three cents per bushel higher in reaction to bullish USDA export figures released early Friday.</p>
