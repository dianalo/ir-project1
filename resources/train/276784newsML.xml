<p>China's coal output was expected to reach 1.35 billion tonnes in 1996, up 4.6 percent from last year, the Xinhua news agency quoted Coal Minister Wang Senhao as saying on Thursday.</p>
<p>China's coal production had shown a 60-million-tonne increase compared with 1995, Wang told a national meeting.</p>
<p>Of China's 93 key state-owned coal mines, 55 were profitable this year, doubling from 26 in 1995 and cutting industry losses by 1.7 billion yuan ($205 million), he said.</p>
<p>These mines had also made 1.55 billion yuan in profits from sideline undertakings, showing an increase of 53.4 percent over last year, he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Wang attributed this year's heightened productivity to the addition of 70 new coal mines as well as an increase in the number of fully mechanised coal-cutting teams, it said.</p>
<p>China has said it would open at least 300 coal projects to foreign investors with priority to projects in pit-head power plants, coal transport facilities and coal-bed methane. It has not said whether investors could export output.</p>
