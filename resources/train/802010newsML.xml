<p>The Russian-U.S. crew aboard the crippled Mir space station on Friday entered their Soyuz escape capsule and shut the hatch ahead of a scheduled 45-minute ride around the ship, officials said.</p>
<p>The crew planned the manoeuvre after enjoying a change of luck on Thursday when they repaired the main Elektron oxygen generating system just as the old crew shut the hatch on their Soyuz capsule to return to Earth, officials said.</p>
<p>After enduring one of the most gruelling six months in the history of human space flight, commander Vasily Tsibliyev and flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin were undergoing rehabilitation and readjustment to life with gravity at the Star City cosmonaut training centre outside Moscow, officials said.</p>
<p>They touched down in the steppes of Kazakhstan on Thursday and later celebrated with caviar and red wine before greeting their families at Star City and taking their first baths in half a year.</p>
<p>Flight officials were relieved that the oxygen system was repaired despite concern that they would have to wait for the U.S. shuttle to bring new parts in late September, but they were still nervous about upcoming docking and repairs.</p>
<p>&quot;An undocking is a pretty tense event,&quot; said Yuri Antoshechkin, head of Mission Control's analysis team.</p>
<p>Mir suffered the worst accident in its history on June 25 when it collided with its cargo ship while it was redocking, damaging the power supply.</p>
<p>Commander Anatoly Solovyov, engineer Pavel Vinogradov and NASA physicist Michael Foale sealed the capsule from Mir at 1:50 p.m. (0950 GMT), a Mission Control spokesman said. They will undock at 5:26 p.m. (1326 GMT) and redock at 6:10 p.m. (1410 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;They will undock, go around the station to look at its construction and video it,&quot; Deputy Flight Director Igor Goncharov told Reuters. &quot;They will dock at the other port near the Spektr module.&quot;</p>
<p>The Spektr module was punctured during the June accident, and is now sealed off from the rest of the station. The two Russian cosmonauts will open the hatch next Wednesday to reattach cables linked to Spektr's solar panels in a risky repair job intended to restore the ship's energy system.</p>
<p>Redocking the Soyuz near Spektr will allow a quick escape if repairs go wrong.</p>
<p>To prepare for the Friday Soyuz trip, the crew shut off the oxygen system they had worked so hard to repair. &quot;We turned it on yesterday evening and it worked fine until this morning, and we have turned it off for two reasons,&quot; Antoshechkin said.</p>
<p>&quot;One, to lower energy demands on the station during the undocking today,&quot; he said. &quot;And second, because it can only be turned off by the crew, and in case that, knock on wood, the undocking fails, then we couldn't turn it off later.&quot;</p>
<p>All three crew members were packed into the Soyuz for Friday's flight because space officials do not want to leave anyone on Mir without an emergency escape vehicle.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Mir will redock with its old Progress resupply ship, the very procedure that caused the June accident. This time however the crew expects to do the operation on automatic pilot.</p>
