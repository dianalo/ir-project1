<headline>NYMEX, LME and others debate Sumitomo crisis.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Sumitomo Corp-type copper scandal could happen again unless the London Metal Exchange (LME) takes responsibility and adopts the necessary level of oversight, a senior New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) official warned in the latest of NYMEX's attacks on the LME.</p>
<p>&quot;The most troubling aspect for me of the LME's role in Sumitomo is not just the differences in regulatory philosophy. Rather, LME's attitude of blindness to Sumitomo and its torpid reaction to events were so clearly and evidently caused and tainted by competitive zeal in its effort to eliminate COMEX as a competitor,&quot; said NYMEX vice president Neal Wolkoff.  </p>
<p>Wolkoff addressed an American Metal Market seminar here.</p>
<p>NYMEX's COMEX division trades a rival copper futures contract to the LME's, and the seminar debated whether Sumitomo's loss of $1.8 billion from unauthorised copper dealings over ten years by its chief copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, could be repeated.</p>
<p>COMEX was angered by the LME's move in April 1995 to open U.S. warehouses to store copper.</p>
<p>Wolkoff claimed the LME &quot;fed information&quot; into the marketplace to &quot;mask the Sumitomo problem with its apparent large scale price information&quot;.  </p>
<p>Wolkoff also contended the investigation into Sumitomo that began at the end of last year by regulatory authorities was due to NYMEX pushing the U.S. regulator Commodity Futures Trading Commission to probe the copper market and was not, as stated by the LME, initiated by the London exchange.</p>
<p>Christopher Green, chairman of Barclays Metals Group and former LME chairman, in a spirited defence of the London exchange, said the CFTC approved the LME's regulatory rules, and NYMEX should be aware of past debacles on its own exchange, such as in silver.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's not enough to cast stones on markets overseas when there is plenty of glasshouses around in the U.S.A.,&quot; Green said. The LME raised its concerns about Sumitomo in the latter part of 1995 and not after the announcement of the $1.8 billion losses, Green added.</p>
<p>Concern was raised at the presentation about the growth in futures, options and especially over the counter (OTC) derivative products.  </p>
<p>But it was a &quot;misconception that the Sumitomo problem was created by the over-the-counter market&quot;, Wolkoff said, referring to the LME's repeated assertion that much of the Sumitomo dealings were outside its sphere of regulation.</p>
<p>It was the &quot;lack of transparency (on the LME) the brought about the problem,&quot; Wolkoff told the seminar.</p>
<p>David Threlkeld, the trader who complained to the LME in 1991 that Hamanaka had requested confirmation of allegedly ficticious trades, told the seminar the LME had not dealt with his complaint properly at the time.  </p>
<p>&quot;Had the LME gone to the correct levels in Sumitomo and asked the correct questions, this might have been avoided. They asked the wrong questions at the wrong levels,&quot; Threlkeld said. &quot;I sense a lot of pussyfooting in London - that's always how it's done.&quot;</p>
<p>Green, who was not on the LME board at the time of Threlkeld's complaint, said the LME had raised the issue with the U.K regulator Securities and Investment Board (SIB), and with Sumitomo &quot;if not at the highest level, but at extremely high levels... How much further can you go.&quot;  </p>
<p>Wolkoff said the LME should &quot;have posed substantially more questions than were posed. A single man resigns from one company and the price of copper falls by one third. That's fairly good evidence that a market was manipulated,&quot; Wolkoff said. The LME should have disclosed its concerns about Sumitomo to warn market participants.</p>
<p>Copper prices crashed following Sumitomo's announcement of its losses in mid-June. Hamanaka was moved from his day-to-day contact with the market mid-May.  </p>
<p>Green suggested there could be some &quot;independent mechanism&quot; to pool information about what's happening in the OTC market, though this would be difficult.</p>
<p>Robert Hageman of Oppenheimer and Co warned, &quot;My main concern is that the regulatory authorities and government are going to step overboard and create more restrictions.&quot;</p>
<p>The SIB is due to issue its report on the workings of the LME in four to five months, Green said.</p>
