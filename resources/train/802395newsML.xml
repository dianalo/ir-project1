<p>U.S. consumers, weighed down by heavy credit card debts, filed for bankruptcy in record numbers during the second quarter despite a buoyant economy, according to data released Friday by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy filings, more than 95 percent by consumers, hit a record 367,168 from April to June, up 24 percent from 297,162 in the same year-ago period and up 10 percent from the old record of 335,073 in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>For the 12-month period ended June 30, a record 1.3 million bankruptcy cases were filed, the agency said. Courts in California, New Jersey and parts of Georgia and Florida reported the most filings over that period.</p>
<p>The continued rise in filings by consumers could spell trouble for credit card issuers, according to industry analyst Warren Heller.</p>
<p>&quot;The industry expected (bankruptcy) growth to moderate or reverse,&quot; said Heller, research director at Veribanc Inc. &quot;It looks like it could get worse instead.&quot;</p>
<p>More recent data tracked by card giant Visa USA Inc. shows the rate of bankruptcy growth slowing, however, Visa spokesman David Sandor said.</p>
<p>&quot;What we saw starting in June was a significant slowdown in the rate of growth,&quot; Sandor said. Based on the most recent weekly figures, &quot;our numbers show a slowdown for the remainder of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The second-quarter increase in the number of bankrupticies could also fuel a drive to change the bankruptcy law, which Visa and other lenders argue encourages excessive filings.</p>
<p>A federal commission reviewing the current system voted on a series of reform proposals earlier this week, but rejected the changes desired by the credit card industry. The sharply divided panel will report its final recommendations to Congress in October.</p>
<p>The rise in bankruptcies &quot;mirrors the rise and build-up in consumer debt over the last several years and just points to the continued need to take a hard look at particularly consumer bankruptcy laws,&quot; said Samuel Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute, a non-partisan research group based in Alexandria, Va.</p>
