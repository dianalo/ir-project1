<p>A Russian doctor called for funds and facilities on Thursday to test a new method to deliver drugs directly into the brain, by-passing the bloodstream, claiming this would help cure mad cow and other brain diseases.</p>
<p>A British government admission last year that people eating infected beef could catch Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a human equivalent of mad cow disease which has killed over 165,000 British cattle, triggered widespread panic.</p>
<p>The invention, which means that drugs no longer have to be injected or swallowed, could be used to treat multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and other illnesses.</p>
<p>&quot;Thousands of people are dying daily from diseases, people who can be cured,&quot; Amsterdam-based neurologist Eduard Lerner, 68, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Lerner, who moved to the Netherlands in 1990, formerly headed a cardiology research team in Moscow.</p>
<p>The invention consists of a battery-powered machine wired to an electrode placed on the patient's head. A current pushes the drug into the brain through nervous tissue, Lerner said, adding that the precise location of the spot was secret.</p>
<p>&quot;Many hundreds of (Russian) patients have been treated and I have never seen any complications,&quot; he claimed.</p>
<p>Lerner said he had conducted experiments at Nijmegen University in the Netherlands but four months ago it stopped the programme, saying it didn't have the money or laboratories to continue.</p>
<p>University officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Lerner said leading pharmaceutical companies had shown great interest. &quot;Everyone is interested but they want to keep full (commercial) control,&quot; he said.</p>
