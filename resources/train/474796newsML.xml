<title>MALAYSIA: Bank Negara reserves rise to 70 bln rgt in '96.</title>

<p>Bank Negara Malaysia said on Friday its reserves rose to 70 billion ringgit by the end of last year against 63.8 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>The central bank said in its annual report for 1996 that the 6.2 billion ringgit rise last year followed two consecutive years of decline.</p>
<p>The reserves represent Malaysia's gold and foreign exchange, its reserve position with the International Monetary Fund and holdings of special drawing rights (SDRs).</p>
<p>The annual report said the rise in reserves was mainly due to a rise in long-term capital flows into the country.</p>
<p>Net private long-term capital flows in 1996 increased to 11.3 billion ringgit against 10.3 billion in the previous year.</p>
<p>This showed &quot;strong net inflows of foreign direct investment (of 14.4 billion ringgit), primarily in the manufacturing (87 percent) and oil and gas (10 percent) sectors&quot;, it said.</p>
<p>However, this was partly offset by investments by Malaysians overseas of 6.3 billion ringgit during the year.  </p>
<p>&quot;The aggregate net inflow of long-term capital was not sufficient to finance the current account deficit, resulting in a deficit in the basic balance of 986 million ringgit (against 2.5 billion last year),&quot; Bank Negara said.</p>
<p>The annual report estimated the 1996 current account deficit at 13 billion ringgit.</p>
<p>Official long-term capital inflows were also lower at 0.7 billion ringgit against 5.8 billion in 1995 because of higher prepayment of loans by the public sector.</p>
