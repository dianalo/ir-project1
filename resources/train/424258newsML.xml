<p>Bulls regained the upper hand and volume rose almost to start-of-year levels on Thursday as stocks took heart from Wall Street's overnight gains and demand continued brisk in Nokia and forestries, brokers said.</p>
<p>The HEX general index ended at a new record close 2,962.29, up 1.34 percent and just off an intra-session life-high of 2,963.56 set earlier. The previous record was 2,931.44.</p>
<p>Total volume was 761 million markka with 32 percent in telecommunications major Nokia and 12 percent in leading forest industry group UPM-Kymmene.</p>
<p>UPM extended its record-breaking spurt on positive recommendations after its 1996 report and comments and boosted other forestries, brokers said.</p>
<p>It closed up 4.50 markka or almost four percent at 118.00 markka, its highest ever, and has now added more than 10 percent since it released 1996 earnings on Tuesday. Brokers said the brisk demand for forest shares came mainly from overseas.</p>
<p>Its rivals Enso and Metsa-Serla both advanced over three percent -- up 1.40 at 45.70 markka and 1.50 at 42.50 respectively.</p>
<p>Nokia traded mostly above its New York close as its on-going road-show in the U.S. and UK kept the stock in focus -- up 1.40 at 314.50 markka in lively trade.</p>
<p>Another mobile phone maker Benefon -- recently strong on its GSM type approval on Monday -- was weaker as investors took profits, but still closed flat at 116.00 markka.</p>
<p>The firm dollar boosted exporters, and paper machine maker Valmet turned higher after a slump that has followed its 1996 report. It closed up 1.00 markka at 92.00.</p>
<p>Construction was also strong, led by Lemminkainen which closed up 2.10 markka or almost four percent at 56.10.</p>
<p>On Friday, brokers said U.S. payrolls would be in focus.</p>
