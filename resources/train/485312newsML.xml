<headline>EIA lowers outlook for U.S. 1997 oil demand.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-04-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. petroleum demand in 1997 is expected to hold at last year's level of 18.23 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Administration said Thursday, lowering its previous forecast of 18.36 million bpd.</p>
<p>The lower demand in turn was reflected in a lower forecast for net petroleum imports, now expected to average 8.84 million bpd in 1997, compared with EIA's earlier projection of 8.9 million bpd.</p>
<p>Net crude oil imports to the United States are expected to average 7.7 million bpd this year, up 33,000 bpd from 1996, but down 60,000 bpd from a previous forecast.</p>
<p>At the same time, EIA revised down its projection for imported crude prices to $20.00 per barrel in 1997 from an earlier projection of $21.04, as prices in the first quarter tumbled more than expected amid a mild winter.</p>
<p>&quot;Weather differences account for much of last year's large increase and lack of growth projected for 1997,&quot; EIA said in its short-term energy outlook.</p>
<p>Petroleum demand in 1996 grew by 500,000 bpd or 2.9 percent.  </p>
<p>U.S. gasoline demand for 1997 is now expected to rise by only 1.5 percent to 7.97 million bpd from last year, down from a projected increase of 2.0 percent to 8.01 million bpd in an earlier forecast.</p>
<p>EIA's outlooks for jet fuel and distillate demand in 1997 were essentially unchanged at 1.61 million bpd for jet fuel and 3.40 million bpd for distillate.</p>
<p>However, residual fuel demand is now projected to drop to 810,000 bpd in 1997, compared with an earlier forecast of a 4.7 percent rise to 890,000 bpd, partly due to the mild winter this year.</p>
<p>EIA said it expected U.S. crude production to decline 2.2 percent to 6.33 million bpd in 1997, lowering its earlier projection by 20,000 bpd.</p>
<p>The outlook assumed that U.S. gross domestic product would rise 2.8 percent in 1997, and that the United Nations would continue to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil.</p>
