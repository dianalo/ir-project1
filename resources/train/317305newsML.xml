<p>Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said on Sunday the new South Africa had scrapped an apartheid- era pro-Israel bias in the Middle East and would sell arms to Syria if it wanted to.</p>
<p>Mbeki, heir apparent to President Nelson Mandela, suggested the United States was being hypocritical in opposing the proposed sale of South African tank-gun aiming gear to Damascus.</p>
<p>&quot;Why would there be an assumption that we should not market (in Syria)?&quot; asked Mbeki, speaking after a four-day general policy planning session of the African National Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't follow a policy in the Middle East such as the policy that was followed by the previous regime which was to form an alliance with Israel and be hostile to the rest of the countries in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't pursue an apartheid policy in terms of our foreign relations in the Middle East... we would not take an apartheid position which would automatically exclude Syria,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States threatened last week to cut aid to South Africa if the deal, to supply a targetting upgrade for Syria's Soviet-built tanks, went ahead. Washington accuses Damascus of supporting terrorism.</p>
<p>South Africa has said companies in at least three European countries are also bidding for the Syrian contract. Local newspapers reported that a U.S. defence contractor was involved in at least one of those bids.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. equipment is being marketed in Syria for precisely the same thing and the U.S. government has let that be because they understand precisely what is happening,&quot; Mbeki told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It may very well be that at a certain point in the process the U.S. government might invoke its own legislation prohibiting the sale of U.S. manufactured equipment. They may -- they haven't (yet) done so,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mandela last week rejected U.S. criticism of South African negotiations with Syria, saying South Africa's enemies were not necessarily the same as Washington's.</p>
<p>Mbeki echoed the sentiment: &quot;We cannot proceed from the position that there is any country that has power of veto over the sovereign decisions of the South African government.&quot;</p>
<p>The South African cabinet is due to discuss the Syrian arms deal during its first regular meeting of the year on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mandela's government declared after taking office in April 1994 that it would bar arms sales to countries involved in conflict or governments that committed human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, a spokesman for the department of foreign affairs said South Africa had approved the sale of &quot;non-lethal&quot; military equipment to the Algerian government, which is fighting Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
<p>He have no details of the deal, but the Johannesburg-based Sunday Independent newspaper said the equipment consisted of pilotless military aircraft. It did not give a value for the contract.</p>
