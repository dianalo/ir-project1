<headline>Euro bourses end mixed, ignoring Wall Street.</headline>

<p>European stock markets ended Thursday's session in a mixed mood as investors stuck close to home, letting domestic events rather than Wall Street set the tone.</p>
<p>On the currency front the mark gained on the dollar, boosted by supportive comments from Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer. After sinking against the yen, the U.S. currency picked itself off its session lows to again trade above 126 yen.</p>
<p>London, Frankfurt and Paris blue chips initially all pushed higher after an overnight surge on Wall Street but their paths then diverged.</p>
<p>French and British stocks moved into negative territory as the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened lower while German equities bucked the trend to remain higher throughout the day. London then bounced back to positive ground as Wall Street edged higher after slipping in and out of the minus column, leaving French shares behind.</p>
<p>London investors remained dogged by fears that a soaring pound would hit corporate earnings later this year. Growing political uncertainties also stymied attempts to push up share prices, strategists said.</p>
<p>Although Britain reported slightly lower-than-expected March inflation, the positive news failed to invigorate the market.</p>
<p>&quot;There are just too many unknowns at the moment so most people are just simply staying away,&quot; one senior dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said fund managers were unlikely to be aggressive buyers until after the May 1 British election, which the opposition Labour party is the odds-on favourite to win, was out of the way.</p>
<p>German shares posted the sole buoyant performance among major European markets, with the IBIS electronic index finishing over 0.4 percent higher. The DAX index of floor trading closed earlier 0.89 percent up.</p>
<p>A weaker-than-expected March business sentiment report and absence of underlying inflationary concerns underpinned the market, but sentiment remained mixed and Frankfurt dealers said investors did not want to commit to large new positions.</p>
<p>&quot;People are very uncertain at the moment,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Engineering giant Daimler Benz proved the market laggard, shedding nearly 3.5 percent after analysts expressed disappointment at a meeting with management following the company results' announcement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Volkswagen shares were star performers as investors switched out of Daimler and into the rival carmaker.</p>
<p>French stocks turned negative on the back of Wall Street's decline and a weak domestic bond market, reversing earlier half-a-percent gains to close 0.22 percent lower.</p>
<p>Rumours of a government shake-up or dissolution of parliament and concerns about the country's 1997 budget deficit also put pressure on shares.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar suffered a setback against the mark as Tietmeyer quashed bullish sentiment by saying the German central bank was not interested in seeing the mark weaken further.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the first time in a long while that they've (German authorities) come out and said something about currency levels,&quot; said one trader at a British bank. &quot;The Japanese have been the ones who were more obviously worried about currency levels.&quot;</p>
<p>But the comment's impact was seen as temporary as Tietmeyer's remark was aimed not at pushing the dollar lower against the mark but at slowing down the speed of its rise, analysts said.</p>
<p>A sharp rise in Japan's March overall trade surplus with the United States weakened the dollar against the yen as fears of heightened trade tension between the two countries grew.</p>
<p>A strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive overseas and imports into the United States cheaper. While slightly weaker, the dollar remains near 37-month highs against the yen.</p>
<p>The United States reported a surprise jump in February imports, boosting the country's overall trade deficit above Wall Street expectations.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have issued a stern warning of trade friction unless Japan became less reliant on exports and promoted growth from within.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.7247 marks and 126.04 yen in late European trade after ending at 1.7285 and 125.80 on Wednesday.</p>

<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 ended 5.79 points lower at 2,615.18.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The IBIS electronic index closed 14.26 points higher at 3,361.80. The 30-share DAX index closed up 29.80 points at 3,383.25.</p>
