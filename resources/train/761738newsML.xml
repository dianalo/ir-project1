<p>The dollar strengthened on Tuesday after overnight profit-taking slowed its powerful run but the pound was further dislodged from recent peaks by talk that British interest rates might not be increased in the near future.</p>
<p>Equity markets got off to a healthy start. Weaker sterling, seen as helping British exporters , boosted London's stocks by 0.4 percent and Frankfurt climbed 0.5 percent, approaching its all-time peak</p>
<p>The U.S. currency , which surged to a seven-and-a-half year high of 1.8490 marks on Monday, lost nearly two pfennigs in overnight deals as traders took profits but regained some poise as Europe opened.</p>
<p>With the dollar trading at 1.8360 in early trading, dealers predicted the currency might take another run at the 1.85-mark level it fell shy of on Monday if reports this week confirm the U.S. economy is growing at a healthy pace without stoking inflation.</p>
<p>The dollar, up five percent against the mark in the last three weeks, has benefited from a growing conviction that Europe's planned single currency would be launched with a broad group of countries, making for a weak euro.</p>
<p>Sterling, which shed five pfennigs against the mark on Monday, was the other key focus for traders, tumbling another two pfennigs early on Tuesday to 2.9965 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling and the dollar are the key today,&quot; said Lee Ferridge, currency strategist at Commerzbank in London. &quot;There is not that much interest to sell dollars and if we get good data and a significant upmove in the Dow, this could take dollar through the roof.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday was a big day for sterling and people are now calling for a top in the pound,&quot; Ferridge said. &quot;Yesterday's retracement was a sharp one but we should form a bottom and move back up given that nothing fundamental has changed.&quot;</p>
<p>The speed of the pound's fall has triggered concern that the one-year rally which took it to multi-year peaks against the mark may be over.</p>
<p>Behind heavy profit-taking in sterling over the last two days is speculation that British interest rates rates might not be raised as, as previously expected, at next week's Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting because of concern about impact of a strong pound on exports</p>
<p>The the falling pound, making British exports more competitive, helped the London bourse. The FTSE-100 index leapt by 0.5 percent after a lacklustre performance on Monday.</p>
<p>But  some non-exporting stocks were depressed by first half earnings from the Abbey National bank which set a weaker tone for the rest of the banking sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Abbey National's results will set the tone today and overseas earners will be looked at more closely,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, stocks climbed to 27.51 points to 4398.67, close to the all-time trading high, before falling back slightly by mid-morning.</p>
<p>Paris stocks, which hit an intra-day high on Monday, made modest gains in trading that was expected to remain quiet ahead of U.S. economic data due at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0945 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.8360 marks and 117.57 yen compared to 1.8466 and 117.70 in late trading on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0945 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index up 25.5 points at 4,888.1.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The DAX index was up 22.43 points in bourse trade at 4,394.94.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 was up 15.99 points at 3,038.19.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $327.50 an ounce, unchanged from Monday's close. Silver was down two cents at $4.37.</p>
