<p>Nomura Securities Co Ltd chairman and president Masashi Suzuki said it was unavoidable that recent raids by authorities would have a negative impact on the company's business, a company spokesman said on Friday.  </p>
<p>The spokesman was confirming Suzuki's comments made in an interview with the Japanese business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun on Thursday.</p>
<p>The paper reported on Friday that Suzuki expects the company's business to be affected from April onwards.</p>
<p>Suzuki noted that some institutional investors had halted transactions with Nomura as a result of the revelations of Nomura's apparently illegal stock deals which led to the raids.</p>
<p>He said the company's business in the bond market may also be affected.</p>
<p>Suzuki also said so-called &quot;VIP accounts&quot; Nomura operates were for accounts on which special care needed to be taken when the customer concerned phoned or visited Nomura branches.</p>
<p>One Japanese daily said on Thursday that Nomura had VIP accounts for about 10,000 customers who it may have given preferential treatment to.</p>
<p>The Mainichi Shimbun said prosecutors had already seized a partial list of the accounts and were asking Nomura to give them the rest of the list.  </p>
<p>Suzuki was also quoted as saying there were no unified rules on how Nomura's branches should operate the VIP accounts.</p>
<p>The scandal surfaced on March 6 when Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage, said internal probes had found that two directors had made discretionary deals and funnelled profits raised through stock trading to a corporate client.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and securities regulators searched Nomura's headquarters and other locations for evidence on the case in raids carried out on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The account of the corporate client, which was run by a relative of a corporate racketeer, was in the list of VIP accounts, the Mainichi said.</p>
<p>Japanese media speculated that the raids by prosecutors may have been aimed at uncovering another potentially more embarrassing scandal involving politicians and bureaucrats who are customers listed in the VIP accounts.  </p>
<p>Suzuki told the Nihon Keizai he is confident that the scandal would not negatively affect ongoing reforms in Japan's financial industry.</p>
<p>He said Nomura will cooperate with the authorities during the investigation and will accept their ruling on whether the deals were conducted with the company management's knowledge, and not only of the individuals involved.</p>
<p>He said he is considering major personnel changes in Nomura and its group firms, including his own position as chairman and president. He said these changes would be made after new graduate recruits join the company on April 1.</p>
<p>Suzuki added the post of president to his position as chairman earlier this month when former president Hideo Sakamaki stepped down over the scandal.</p>
