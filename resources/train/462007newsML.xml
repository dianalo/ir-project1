<p>Former South African president F.W. de Klerk on Sunday accused Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu's truth commission of bias and denied again that he had known about political assassinations or death squads.</p>
<p>De Klerk told a news conference in Cape Town that he had on Sunday submitted a 50-page response to questions from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission arising out of a document handed in last year.</p>
<p>He responded to about 50 questions without adding significantly to existing evidence on his National Party's human rights record during 48 years of white rule.</p>
<p>But he said in the document and repeated at the news conference that the commission was losing its credibility amongst whites.</p>
<p>&quot;Whole classes of decent people and communities are being associated in the public's perceptions with the criminal actions of a few individuals, of which they were not aware and which they would not have condoned had they known of them.</p>
<p>&quot;The overwhelming majority of the members of our party have been horrified by the revelations of abuses,&quot; de Klerk said.</p>
<p>The commission, appointed to heal the wounds of apartheid, has heard gruelling testimony torture and abuse by police and former policemen have confessed to killing a number of anti- apartheid activists.</p>
<p>De Klerk, who repudiated apartheid in 1990 and four years later surrendered power to President Nelson Mandela, insisted he had not been a party to any decision to kill apartheid foes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a lie that I knew. It's a lie that I was part of any conspiracy to do these terrible things... to assassinate people. How many times much I say it's a lie before people hear me?.&quot;</p>
<p>De Klerk said the commission was working harder to uncover government abuses of human rights than those perpetrated by President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and its supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The time has arrived for balance and for action on the part of the commission if it wants to perform its duties,&quot; he urged.</p>
<p>De Klerk said his party would continue to cooperate with the commission, but added that the perception of imbalance would affect the willingness and enthusiasm with which it cooperated.</p>
<p>Now the main parliamentary opposition leader, de Klerk is expected to give further testimony to the truth body in May, according to a party spokesman.</p>
