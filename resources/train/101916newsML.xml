<p>Britain's ruling Conservatives, set the task by Prime Minister John Major of killing off socialism by a victory in the next election, confront their biggest challenge on Wednesday -- policy on Europe.</p>
<p>After a day of skirmishing over Europe on the fringes of their annual conference, Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind will urge Conservatives to unite behind Major's wait-and-see stance on whether to join the single European currency set for 1999.</p>
<p>The desire to close ranks to give the party a fighting chance of clawing back the opposition Labour party's 20-point poll was evident on Tuesday when Major won an important endorsement from his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>Thatcher, ousted in an internal party coup in 1990, has made no secret in the past of her disappointment at what she sees as Major's failure to keep the flame of her ruggedly individualist free-market ideology burning bright.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday Thatcher, who was in power for 11 years, spoke generously of her milder-mannered successor in a very public display of reconciliation.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good to know that the affairs of this nation are in such safe hands,&quot; she told him at a party reception.</p>
<p>&quot;I have fought more elections than I care to recall. But it has never been more important to see the Conservatives returned to office -- and you to Downing Street,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Major, who must call an election by May, said the task Thatcher started in extending opportunity and devolving responsibility was not yet finished.</p>
<p>&quot;For four successive elections the Labour party has been soundly defeated. A fifth successive election defeat for them and I feel we will have killed socialism for good.</p>
<p>&quot;That is a prize worth fighting for. It is a prize worth working for and it is a prize worth uniting for in the next general election,&quot; Major, aware his would-be successors are already jockeying for position at this week's gathering, said.</p>
<p>If Major is defeated and Labour returns to power for the first time since 1979, the divisions over Europe that have dogged his six years in office will be largely to blame.</p>
<p>Prominent Conservatives lined up on Tuesday to challenge Major's established line and urge him to say before the election that Britain would not join the single currency, at least in the first wave in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposal to give up the pound is a constitutional outrage and would be an economic disaster... We are sleepwalking towards a general election unable to make up our minds about an issue that will have to be decided next year,&quot; ex-treasury minister David Heathcoat-Amory, who quit his post earlier this year to campaign against monetary union, said.</p>
<p>Another &quot;Euro-sceptic&quot; opposed to closer European integration, Bill Cash, said Britain was heading for &quot;one country -- a German Europe&quot; unless it blocked the plan.</p>
<p>Using similar language, ex-Conservative party chairman Lord Norman Tebbit said any countries that fused their currencies in 1999 would become little more than &quot;German colonies&quot;.</p>
<p>It was left to another former Conservative minister, Sir Leon Brittan, to make the positive case for Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;If those hostile to the European Union wish to pursue the debate with integrity, it is time for them to declare their hand,&quot; said Brittan, now a European Commissioner.</p>
<p>&quot;Do they wish the United Kingdom to continue as a member of the EU, or would they like Britain to withdraw altogether?&quot;</p>
