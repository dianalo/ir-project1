<p>U.S. stock index futures ended mostly higher but down from early afternoon peaks in light trade.</p>
<p>&quot;There just hasn't been a whole lot going on,&quot; a Standard and Poor's 500 futures trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said bullish technical momentum and strong Treasury bonds buoyed stock index futures most of the day, but once T-bond futures closed stock indices began to erode.</p>
<p>September S&amp;P 500 futures volume was estimated on CME price boards at 64,000 contracts, but traders said the figure appearead overstated.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was really quiet all day,&quot; another S&amp;P 500 futures trader said.</p>
<p>September Standard and Poor's 500 futures reached a fresh record high at 963.90 during the session, beating out last Friday's 951.75 high. Traders said more record highs were inevitable, given the blatant bullishness of the market. They said players continue to buy dips.</p>
<p>A foray below 956.00 in early trade found buyers and traders put more support at 953.00 and 951.75.</p>
<p>&quot;On the upside, who knows?&quot; a trader said. &quot;Call NASA: this thing is just a rocketship on the upside,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Traders said the firm market tone got started with Treasury bonds and second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) and a first-quarter revision. GDP rose 2.2 percent in the second quarter and was revised downward to 4.9 percent from 5.9 percent in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Jobless claims fell to 277,000 in the latest week, from 299,000.</p>
<p>At the close, Sept S&amp;P 500s were up 0.80 pts to 957.95, Nikkei rose 75.0 pts to 20,375.0, Midcap 400s rose 0.25 to 316.10, Russell fell 1.45 to 415.55 and NASDAQ rose 5.25 to 1114.50.</p>
