<title>USA: FCOJ futures end up, off highs in anxious market.</title>
<headline>FCOJ futures end up, off highs in anxious market.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>FCOJ futures closed firmer but drifted off the highs as the market sorted through conflicting news reports, market sources said.</p>
<p>The March contract settled up 0.05 to 87.35, traded 89.50 to 87.25. The back months closed down 2.70 to 0.60 higher.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 2,500 lots.</p>
<p>Technical support remained at 83.80 cents and then at the recent low of 76.40 cents in March. Resistance was pegged at 92.90 and then at the recent high of 99.00 cents.</p>
<p>Prices rose early on an announcement late Thursday by Tropicana. The company said between 10 million and 15 million 90-lb boxes of oranges, or up to 7 percent of the Florida crop, will be lost to the Jan 19 freeze.</p>
<p>While the estimate is not an official one, it is the first forecast on freeze damage so far. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its estimate Feb 12.</p>
<p>A strong weekly movement figure of 6.5 million gallons added bullish sentiment to the market, traders said.</p>
<p>Warming temperatures in Florida, and the feeling that even a 7 percent loss is not significant amid ample supplies from the U.S. and Brazil, and slow demand, pressured prices late in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;People are being cautious,&quot; Celeste Georgakis, vice president with Dean Whitter, said. She expects activity to remain choppy ahead of the USDA's February crop report.</p>
<p>&quot;Until (the USDA) publishes the estimate, we will have a nervous market.&quot;</p>
