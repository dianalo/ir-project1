<headline>U.S. Midwest hogs seen steady after holiday - trade.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-08-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Midwest cash hog prices Tuesday were seen mostly steady having already been priced into the market early Friday, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>A surplus of hogs this week gave packers more than adequate live inventory to get started following the Labor Day holiday on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>One major packer was said to have bought hogs for delivery as far out as Thursday next week.</p>
<p>Iowa and Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to the plant were seen at $56.50 per cwt while Illinois tops were pegged at $56.00 and Indiana/Ohio at $55.00-$55.50.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think we'll be steady after the holiday, until they (packers) see what happens with product prices,&quot; a southern Minnesota hog buyer said.</p>
<p>A seasonal increase in hog supplies this week, coupled with deteriorating demand for pork pulled direct cash hog prices down an average $3.00 to the lowest levels since mid- to- late June, according to market sources.</p>
<p>The cut-out value of U.S. Number two pork carcasses slid further Thursday to $74.78 per cwt, down $3.24 from last Friday.</p>
