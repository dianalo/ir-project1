<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss right-winger challenges humanitarian fund.</title>

<p>A populist opponent of a planned Swiss foundation to aid victims of Holocaust and other abuses with the use of central bank gold challenged top government officials on Saturday to put their money where their mouth is.</p>
<p>Right-wing Swiss politician Christoph Blocher, who claims the plan implies guilt when the Swiss have nothing to be guilty about, said its backers including the central bank chief should fund the foundation with their own money, not with public funds.</p>
<p>The plan, brain child of Swiss National Bank chairman Hans Meyer, calls for the central bank to fund the huge humanitarian foundation by selling off part of its official gold reserves.</p>
<p>Swiss voters must approve the plan, unveiled by Swiss president Arnold Koller in March, in a referendum next year shaping up as a watershed in Swiss foreign and domestic policy.</p>
<p>Blocher, from the right-wing Swiss People's Party, has urged voters to overturn the plan, arguing that selling central bank gold is equal to giving away family silver at a time when the country is facing economic hardship.</p>
<p>&quot;The concept of this solidarity (foundation) has become an empty one,&quot; said Blocher, the man whose isolationist arguments helped persuade Swiss voters in 1992 to reject closer ties with the European Union.</p>
<p>Instead, Switzerland's rich and leading government figures must give the equivalent of a year's salary to the foundation, Swiss news agency ATS quoted him as telling a meeting in capital Berne organised to discuss a scathing U.S. government report in May that alleged the Swiss were bankers to the Nazis.</p>
<p>The report, compiled by U.S. Under-secretary of Commerce Stuart Eizenstat, has outraged many Swiss and stiffened opposition to the humanitarian foundation plan.</p>
<p>Blocher said he was ready to put up his own money for the foundation if businessmen and government figures did the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who speak of this Solidarity Foundation should not use the funds of the people but their own private wealth,&quot; ATS quoted him as saying. &quot;My million is ready.&quot;</p>
<p>Swiss businesses have also launched a 265 million Swiss franc memorial fund amid boycott threats from Jewish groups who accuse banks of hoarding the dormant wealth that Jews murdered by Hitler had stashed in Switzerland for safekeeping.</p>
