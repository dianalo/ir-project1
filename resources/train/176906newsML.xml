<headline>Stocks fall on profit-taking after election rally.</headline>

<p>Stocks fell Friday as investors took profits after a post-election rally, but some analysts said the market could move higher next week.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.32 points to 6,196.72. The blue-chip index rallied 97 points to set a record Wednesday, then rose 28 points to a record 6,206.04 on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 13-9 on active volume of 230 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.40 points to 1,251.74.</p>
<p>&quot;After the big move in stocks and bonds, and bonds in particular, you have to expect some profit-taking, especially when the long bond yield went down to 6.5 percent,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 20/32 to yield 6.58 percent, up from 6.54 percent at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>He said the excuse for stocks' weakness could be found in Friday's release of September wholesale inventories, which fell 1.3 percent after a 0.1 percent drop in August.</p>
<p>More importantly, the stocks/sales ratio -- a measure of consumer demand -- came in at 1.27, the lowest since a 1.27 reading in August of 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;This hints that production will have to be increased at the wholesale level to replenish stocks,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;That's the excuse that touched off some profit-taking in the stock and bond markets. The stocks that have been real winners -- like the semi (conductors) and regional banks, computers and electric utilities -- are the losers today.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnson said stocks that went up are &quot;hitting a wall today. Investors will go home for the weekend, brush themselves off and come back for another fight on Monday.&quot;</p>
<p>Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd., said the market was undergoing a normal consolidation and, in fact, wanted to move higher.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a much overdue consolidation after two screaming up days,&quot; Bleier said. &quot;There is obviously a desire to own stocks just below where the market is. I think the market is within 1 or 2 percent of a near-term top before we see further consolidation.&quot;</p>
<p>Big losers included Advanced Tissue Sciences Inc., which fell 3-1/2 to 11-1/8 after Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the stock to neutral from strong buy.</p>
<p>Technology stocks gave back some of their recent gains, with Intel Corp. down 7/8 at 121-1/4, Cisco Systems down 1-1/8 at 63-3/8, Microsoft Corp. down 3/4 at 142-3/4 and International Business Machines Corp. down 5/8 at 133-1/8.</p>
<p>Iomega Corp., which topped the NYSE most active list on its first day of NYSE trading, was down 1/2 at 24-7/8.</p>
<p>Conrail Inc. rallied 2-1/8 to 95-1/8 as the bidding war for the company between Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. brought a sweetened offer from Norfolk.</p>
<p>America Online Inc. rose 1-1/4 to 26 after Lehman Brothers reiterated a buy rating on the stock. The company reported a first-quarter loss, but Lehman analyst Brian Oakes said he was pleased with signs that momentum was picking up.</p>
