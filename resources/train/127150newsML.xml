<p>The European Commission is investigating allegations that European producers of special steel are operating a price-fixing cartel, steel industry and legal sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Under investigation is the practice of adding to the price of special steel products an &quot;alloy charge&quot; to compensate for erratic movements in the price of nickel and chrome, which are used in the making of stainless steel.</p>
<p>The Commission had no immediate comment, but an industry source said a probe had started less than a year ago following complaints from users of special steel. Such users include the automobile, building and machinery sectors.</p>
<p>A Brussels-based antitrust lawyer confirmed the probe and said that the Commission had launched dawn raids at the premises of a number of companies. He would not elaborate.</p>
<p>Cracking down on illegal cartels is one of the Commission's most difficult tasks because companies involved keep the matter closely held.</p>
<p>The steel sector has been a Commission target before. In February 1994 the Commission fined 16 European companies a total 100 million European currency units ($120 million) for fixing the price and sharing the market for steel beams.</p>
<p>In the present case, however, the practice of fixing alloy charges is hardly secret and has been in place practically since the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in the early 1950s. The ECSC is one of the EU's founding institutions,</p>
<p>&quot;The practice has existed for 50 years&quot;, the source said.</p>
<p>A rise in alloy charges following a higher demand for nickel and chrome some 18 months ago appears to have triggered the complaints.</p>
<p>The industry source denied that producers were in a position to dictate the rules saying special steel users were powerful enough to influence prices on their own.</p>
<p>The most important companies in the special steel producing sector include Germany's Thyssen and Krupp, Usinor Sacilor's unit Ugine, Sweden's Avesta Sheffield, British Steel and Acciai Speciali Terni SpA which is controlled by Krupp.</p>
<p>Outside the steel industry the Commission in 1994 also imposed fines totalling a record 248 million European currency units (Ecus) on 42 European cement producers and associations found guilty of operating a market sharing agreement.</p>
<p>Last July the Commission announced that it would reduce or drop fines for companies that would help it to bust cartels.</p>
