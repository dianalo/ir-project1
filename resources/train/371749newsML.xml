<title>UK: Refiners' lead times lengthen as gold demand booms.</title>
<headline>Refiners' lead times lengthen as gold demand booms.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-12</dateline>

<p>Delivery times for gold ten tola bars (3.746 troy ounces) and kilo bars from European refineries has lengthened to weeks rather than days reflecting booming demand for physical gold, trade sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone wanting ten tola bars or kilo bars now would be told to expect delivery at the end of March or the first week in April,&quot; an industry source said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Typically last year turnround time would have been a week or two weeks. A year ago, the turnround would have been two to three weeks, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not that unusual compared with the first half of 1993 or 1995. We have had much longer lead times than this,&quot; the industry source said.</p>
<p>A dealer at a Swiss bank said, &quot;Refineries are running at full capacity,&quot; adding that in Switzerland refineries were doing overtime.</p>
<p>He said the strong demand was related to the price.</p>
<p>&quot;It is purely due to the price. People in the U.S. are buying small bars. In America gold is cheap,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The same held true for other markets where the currency is tied to the dollar exchange rate, he said.</p>
<p>As to the refinery activity, he added, &quot;It is only a transformation from standard bars (bricks) into smaller bars, whether for hoarding purposes or for jewellery.&quot;</p>
<p>The glut of refining which involed refining dore (semi-refined gold) from mines, recasting good delivery bars supplied by bullion banks and remelting some secondary gold, also reflected surging demand in the Middle and Far East, the industry source said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have just had the Chinese New Year and the Indian wedding season continues so there is a seasonal element as well. But a high price would cool off the level of interest,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A sharp bounce to around $360-$370 for bullion would cut off demand but a steady crawl higher would have less impact, he said.</p>
<p>The sources emphasised that the refining was being done to satisfy demand for small bars and not principally to bring sub-quality gold up to good delivery standard (min 99.5 percent) for sale into the market, for instance on behalf of a central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the work we are doing is on behalf of the bullion banks,&quot; said one of the sources.</p>
