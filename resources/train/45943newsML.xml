<p>Leading Russian shares slipped on Wednesday on profit-taking after fluctuations during the day, traders said, forecasting further losses on minor volatility.</p>
<p>The RTS index of 21 shares fell 2.83 percent to 166.73 on $14.7 million volume.</p>
<p>Mosenergo eased to $0.9375 from $0.9550 at Tuesday's close on the Russian Trading System (RTS). UES fell to $0.0749 from $0.0765. Gazprom rose to $0.345 from $0.315. LUKoil dropped to $8.79 from $8.95.</p>
<p>Alexander Fonarkov, a trader from Trinfiko brokerge, said foreign investors were holding off trading ahead of President Boris Yeltsin's announced end-of-month heart surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will be watching Yeltsin's cardiogram and it will be one of the main factors (in market movement),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said last week he would undergo a heart operation at the end of September and doctors said it would be a bypass.</p>
<p>Fonarkov said some foreign and Russian operators sold shares while the possibility remained, anticipating further market stagnation and decreased liquidity.</p>
<p>Boris Shvedsky, a broker from IK Aton, said the market was waiting impatiently for new Western orders, but even at current low prices there was very little buying.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices have fallen low enough and many are interested to buy,&quot; he said. &quot;But buying is going on very cautiosly. Many are waiting for the end of September and do not want to push the market up.&quot;</p>
