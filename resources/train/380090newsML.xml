<p>Economists are deeply divided in their forecasts for Japan&quot;s customs-cleared trade balance in January, with some expecting the first rise in the surplus for more than two years and others predicting a trade deficit.</p>
<p>Economists&quot; forecasts for the January trade surplus ranged from a deficit of 190 billion yen to a surplus of 150 billion yen, compared with a surplus of 61.2 billion yen in January, 1996.</p>
<p>Japan&quot;s trade surplus fell for a 25th straight month in December on a year-on-year basis.</p>
<p>January figures are due to be announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Economists said January trade figures are a poor guide to changes in Japan&quot;s trade pattern since they vary widely depending on when companies resume work after the New Year holidays.</p>
<p>This year, there were five consecutive days of holidays, whereas last year the five days of holidays were broken up by a weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Exports were concentrated in the last 10 days of January, and it is difficult to predict the amount in the period,&quot; an economist at a major research institute said.</p>
<p>In the first 10 days of January, Japan posted a trade deficit of 350.68 billion yen, compared with a deficit of 284.28 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Economists who predicted a continued decline in Japan&quot;s trade surplus said the value of imports in January was high as the weak yen pushed up overall import prices.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, economists said they expect the yen&quot;s weakening since mid-1995 to help boost exports, while discouraging imports, eventually causing a halt in the trend of a declining surplus.</p>
<p>Forecasts by individual research firms are as follows:</p>
<p>    IBJ				   -190   billion yen</p>
<p>    NCB RESEARCH INSTITUTE	   -19   billion yen</p>
<p>    DAIWA BANK RESEARCH		 10.1 billion yen</p>
<p>    SALOMON BROTHERS		    10   billion yen</p>
<p>    YAMAICHI RESEARCH		   48   billion yen</p>
<p>    NIKKO RESEARCH			50   billion yen</p>
<p>    MERRILL LYNCH JAPAN		 67   billion yen</p>
<p>    DKB RESEARCH			  70   billion yen</p>
<p>    OKASAN				 125   billion yen</p>
<p>    BZW				    150   billion yen</p>
