<p>A supporter of outspoken General Alexander Lebed defeated a Kremlin-backed rival to be elected mayor of the central Russian city of Samara, Interfax news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted provisional election results as saying Georgy Limansky had received more than 54 percent of Sunday's vote, compared to the 38 percent received by deputy mayor Anatoly Afanasyev. Turnout was 41 percent.</p>
<p>Limansky is deputy head of the regional parliament and head of the regional branch of the Russian Popular Republican Party.</p>
<p>The party is led by Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's ex-security aide and now a fierce critic.</p>
<p>Lebed ran on a tough law and order ticket in the last presidential election and is widely expected to enter the next race for president in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Afanasyev was backed by reformists in the Kremlin including Oleg Sysuyev, who was mayor of Samara, 900 km (560 miles) southeast of Moscow, until he joined the Russian government's reform team in March.</p>
<p>Afanasyev and Limansky were the front-runners in a first round of voting in Samara two weeks ago, but neither had won enough votes then for outright victory.</p>
<p>Afanasyev's defeat was a disappointment for the Kremlin. But it was overshadowed by the success of reformist Ivan Sklyarov who beat a communist rival on Sunday to become governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region.</p>
