<p>The launch of a variant to Pernod Ricard's Orangina fizzy drink, a red-coloured blood orange Orangina, has slightly boosted the brand's share in a shrinking market, Orangina chairman Jacques Pfister said.</p>
<p>Pfister told Friday's issue of advertising industry weekly Strategies that Orangina sanguine, launched just in France in April last year, had taken 1.5 percent of the total French soft drinks market in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We hoped to sell five million litres in 1996. In eight months, from April to December, we ran out 20 million litres or 15 percent of the volume of orange Orangina,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A third of those persuaded to drink Orangina sanguine were consumers of orange Orangina, so the sales volume of mainstream Orangina had fallen, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But cannibalisation is not a real risk. As the marginal launch costs are low, with the same bottle and label, it doesn't matter much to us if we fill our bottles with orange or red (drink),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall we have gained 0.2 percent of market share and Orangina's total sales volume has been held steady in a declining market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Orangina plans to extend the coverage of Orangina sanguine into cafes, where cover so far is just 30 percent, and to carry out sponsoring specific to the red drink, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim is to differentiate our publicity for the two varieties,&quot; he said.</p>
