<p>New leader Tung Chee-hwa has won the support of more than half Hong Kong citizens for his housing reform drive to beat skyrocketing residential prices, a poll said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The survey yielded the first public reaction to an inaugural policy speech by the new post-colonial leader of China's latest and richest Special Region.</p>
<p>Respondents said they believed his 10-year plan unveiled on Tuesday, first day of Beijing's Hong Kong rule, would stabilise home prices in this crowded region where the government controls the supply of land for building.</p>
<p>Tung said he would act to curb property speculation. He promised efforts to increase land supply and housing production, saying he planned a 70 per cent home ownership rate in a decade for this territory of 6.4 million people.</p>
<p>Dismaying prospective homebuyers, Hong Kong residential prices have soared almost 30 percent this year on speculation and land scarcity in a region with some of the world's most expensive property values.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule at midnight on Monday when Beijing-backed Tung became new leader.</p>
<p>About 56 percent of 1,600 people surveyed by a property agency on Tuesday and published in Ming Pao Daily newspaper on Wednesday, said they thought Tung's housing policy could stabilise prices.</p>
<p>In the poll, 65 per cent of respondents said increasing the supply of land on the market was the most effective solution to Hong Kong's housing problem.</p>
<p>More than 60 percent of respondents said they had confidence in Hong Kong's economic development, usually sensitive to the property sector, in the coming year.</p>
<p>In a separate survey by another property agency, 78 per cent of 906 respondents said the government should take measures to curb property prices as soon as possible.</p>
