<p>A sharp rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index shows the U.S. economy grew at a brisk pace in May, a top NAPM offical said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;(The rise in the NAPM index) certaintly indicates a good bit of growth in the economy in the month of May,&quot; Norbert Ore, who chairs the NAPM business survey committee, told reporters in a teleconference.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, the NAPM said its May Purchasing Management Index rose to 57.1 from 54.2 in April.  </p>
<p>Ore said a strong jump in the new orders component of the index to 64.2 in May against a 57.9 reading in April suggested that manufacturing growth might continue in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;New orders always leads production, so it should indicate that the (industry) growth would continue,&quot; Ore said.</p>
<p>The official said the rise in the May NAPM index, the highest since November 1994, was not seen as a one-time jump but as an indication of sustained economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;(The rise in the May index) is not necessarily an aberration ... I think it's just an indication of good sustained growth,&quot; Ore said.</p>
<p>Ore said there was widespread expectations among purchasing managers that prices would not rise in the near future, adding that he see did not see a lot of inflation signs on the horizon.</p>
<p>He also said manufacturing employment was expected to continue to grow despite a slight drop in May. The employment component of the NAPM index fell to 52.6 in May from 52.8 in April.</p>
