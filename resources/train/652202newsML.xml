<p>IMM currency futures closed mostly higher, with yen leading advances and marks holding slim gains in rangebound trade ahead of the European Union's Amsterdam summit, traders and floor analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Marks will be relatively flat ahead of Amsterdam,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>September marks remained below Tuesday's highs as comments from various European officials failed to lift expectations for a budget stability pact at the June 16 meeting, they said. Expectations for a pact were dashed on Monday after France said it needed at least a week to consider the budget accord.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday, French president Jacques Chirac said in response to reporters' questions that he believed a stability pact could be signed at the EU summit in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>German finance minister Theo Waigel said EU economics and finance ministers could gather for a special meeting on Sunday night ahead of Monday's summit.</p>
<p>However, September marks only rallied to $0.5879, below Tuesday's pit session high of $0.5887. Resistance is at the 50-day moving average of $0.5901 and at the one-week high of $0.5916. One trader estimated that September marks would rally no higher than $0.6001, or 1.6780 spot, in the near term.  </p>
<p>&quot;It seems as though EMU will be pushed through in a dilutive manner,&quot; one currency analyst said. &quot;The mark will continue to have safe-haven status, but ultimately this is bearish.&quot;</p>
<p>He, as well as other currency analysts, said EMU uncertainties were supporting yen. Several noted the decline in the cash mark/yen spread.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be watching mark/yen tonight,&quot; one currency futures trader said.</p>
<p>They said the dollar was bogged down by trade problems, and waning expectations for a U.S. rate hike in July.  </p>
<p>They said U.S. May retail sales and producer prices could confirm the low U.S. inflationary environment. Retail sales, which will be released on Thursday at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT, are forecast to rise 0.4 percent, from down 0.3 percent in April.</p>
<p>Weekly U.S. jobless claims will also be released on Thursday. Claims are forecast to fall to 326,000, from 337,000 in the previous week.</p>
<p>The U.S. May Producer Price Index (PPI), which will be out on Friday at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT, is estimated to rise 0.1 percent overall and in the core rate. In April overall PPI fell 0.6 percent, while the core rate declined 0.1 percent.  </p>
<p>At the end of pit trade, September yen was up $0.000100 at $0.009129, marks rose $0.0010 at $0.5870, Swiss francs were $0.0024 higher at $0.7041, sterling fell $0.0008 at $1.6342, Canadian dollars were unchanged at $0.7258, Australian dollars were $0.0050 lower at $0.7577 and Mexican pesos were $0.000425 higher at $0.120525.</p>
