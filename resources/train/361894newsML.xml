<title>PHILIPPINES: Philippine lawmakers seek to stop oil deregulation.</title>

<p>Four Philippine opposition legislators along with three rights groups on Thursday filed a petition in the Supreme Court to stop the government from going ahead with full deregulation of the oil industry.</p>
<p>The government has set February 8 as the date when the country's oil sector, which has been under state control for over two decades, will be completely deregulated.</p>
<p>The petitioners, Congressmen Edcel Lagman, Joker Arroyo, Enrique Garcia and Wigberto Tanada along with groups representing labour unions and human rights organisations said the deregulation of the oil industry would lead to a rise in local oil prices and hurt the Filipino people.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to the extreme imminence of the questioned full deregulation .. petitioners are entitled to a temporary restraining order,&quot; the petition said.</p>
<p>Court officials said the petition had been received but there was no word on when it might be considered.</p>
<p>The oil deregulation programme, a part of President Fidel Ramos' economic reforms agenda, has been implemented since August last year when the government began dismantling controls on marketing and prices of petroleum products.</p>
<p>To cushion the impact of deregulation, the government decided to implement it in phases and full deregulation was scheduled for March this year.</p>
<p>Under the controlled regime, the government had subsidised fuel prices through a fund which ran into a deficit of over 2.4 billion pesos ($91 million).</p>
<p>Last year, the government set aside a separate one billion peso fund to finance subsidies during the partial deregulation phase but that money ran out too, forcing the government to advance full deregulation by one month to February 8.</p>
<p>The legislators, who belong to various opposition parties, said the government had no authority to advance the date.</p>
<p>This petition is one in a series of attempts to thwart government policy by litigation.</p>
<p>In the past week, two major privatisation bids have been taken to the courts.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the Philippine Court of Appeals temporarily halted the privatisation of the Manila Waterworks system after a petition charged that Ramos lacked the authority to carry out the programme.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Supreme Court threw out the winning bid of a Malaysian company for the historic Manila Hotel and awarded it to a Filipino company which had lost the bidding and later offered to match the winner's price.</p>
<p>And on Thursday, lawyers for a group called Legal Rights and Natural Resources Center said they would file a petition to challenge the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 which opens the mining industry to foreign firms. They said the petition would be filed on Friday.</p>
