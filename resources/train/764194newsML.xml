<p>Swiss banks were tight-lipped ahead of a U.S. court hearing set for Thursday that could decide the future of three big lawsuits charging the banks hoarded billions of dollars worth of unclaimed assets from Holocaust victims.</p>
<p>In separate class-action suits filed in New York, Holocaust survivors and heirs are demanding billions of dollars or records from Swiss banks including the biggest -- Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), Credit Suisse Group and Swiss Bank Corp (SBC).</p>
<p>The banks on Tuesday declined to say what outcome they expected when lawyers for the two sides met once again before Judge Edward Korman of the Eastern District federal court in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>&quot;In theory Judge Korman could say he rejects the suits, he could say he will accept the cases or he could postpone a decision,&quot; Swiss Bank Corp spokesman Michael Willi told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we are interested in what the judge decides, but I cannot speculate on what he will do,&quot; Willi added.</p>
<p>The lawsuits, seeking damages of at least $20 billion, are the key remaining obstacle to Swiss efforts to calm an international furore over the fate of Holocaust-era assets.</p>
<p>The banks took a big step towards appeasing their main critics, the World Jewish Congress (WJC), by breaking secrecy last week to publish over 1,870 names of foreigners who opened Swiss accounts before the end of World War Two in 1945 and had mostly gone unheard from sine then.</p>
<p>But lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that individual Holocaust victims, not organisations like the World Jewish Congress, should be able to look into records directly from the banks.</p>
<p>New York lawyer Edward Fagan, who filed the first class-action lawsuit last October, was quoted as saying the banks released the list one week before the court hearing in order to impress the judge with their efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course the timing was deliberately chosen...The list is ridiculous. All it shows is that the banks have withheld information for 50 years,&quot; Fagan told the Swiss newspaper Berner Zeitung.</p>
<p>The banks have asked the judge to dismiss or delay the cases, arguing that Holocaust victims and heirs are better served by efforts to find lost wealth that the banks have launched under the watchful eye of world Jewish groups.</p>
<p>The banks also argue the search for dormant assets is being led by an independent panel set up last year with the WJC and other Jewish groups and headed by former U.S. central bank chairman Paul Volcker.</p>
<p>&quot;The Swiss Bankers Association thinks the class action suits are senseless and unnecessary because they would mean a duplication of the work already going on in Switzerland,&quot; said Silvia Matile, spokeswoman for the association of about 400 banks.</p>
<p>Since last year, the campaign has also produced:</p>
<p>-- a Holocaust memorial fund of 265 million Swiss francs ($175 million) from Swiss banks, businesses and the central bank for humanitarian aid to Holocaust victims.</p>
<p>-- a government-named international commission of historians probing neutral Switzerland's wartime role as a financial centre</p>
<p>-- a Swiss government proposal, which still needs approval from parliament and a national referendum next year, to sell part of official gold reserves to finance a huge humanitarian fund.</p>
<p>Class-action suits are filed by plaintiffs in the belief they represent an entire class of potential claimants whose suits can be combined into one.</p>
