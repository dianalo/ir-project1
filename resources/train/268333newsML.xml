<p>Renault and General Motors Europe said on Thursday they had signed an agreement to jointly develop and market light commercial vehicles in Europe to boost their presence in the small but growing market.</p>
<p>The agreement, announced in June, is the latest in a series of alliances by auto companies seeking to exploit profitable niche markets without taking on huge development costs.</p>
<p>&quot;It will allow both companies to reinforce their positions in Europe in the commercial vehicle market and increase their offerings in this segment,&quot; Renault said in a statement.</p>
<p>Similar partnerships have been formed between PSA Peugeot Citroen and Italy's Fiat and between Fort Motor Co and Volkswagen of Germany.</p>
<p>Car analysts say automakers worry little about diluting or compromising their brand image through joint ventures in light commercial vehicles because the vehicles' primary purpose is utilitarian and styling plays a secondary role.</p>
<p>They say the alliances do not presage mergers, which face huge political hurdles in Europe as seen in the 1993 collapse of a merger project between Renault and Sweden's Volvo.</p>
<p>The market in western Europe for light commercial vehicles -- pickups, panel vans and small trucks sold almost exclusively to businesses -- represents around 1.3 million sales annually, or about a tenth of the car market, and is growing at an annual rate of around six percent.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Renault said the agreement lays out cooperation plans extending beyond the year 2010.</p>
<p>In the first stage, Renault will supply General Motors Europe with its Trafic panel van with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 3.1 tonnes early next year. GM will rename the vehicle Arena and sell it first in Britain and then in Germany under the Vauxhall brand.</p>
<p>Renault will subsequently supply GM with a range of panel vans of between 2.8 and 3.5 tonnes being developed to replace the 16-year-old Master. They will be sold in the second half of 1997 under the Renault brand in France and under GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands.</p>
<p>The highlight of the agreement entails the joint development of a vehicle in the 2.5- to 2.8-tonne range scheduled to hit the market in the year 2000 under the companies' respective brand names. This vehicle will be the replacement for the Trafic, which was first produced in 1980.</p>
<p>Initial studies on the project will be carried out at Renault's Creos research facility in France, and the new vehicle will be built by IBC Vehicles Ltd, which currently makes the Frontera for Opel and Vauxhall. The Renault spokeswoman told Reuters it would be produced at an annual rate of 60,000 units.</p>
<p>The Renault Express, the smallest light commercial vehicle produced by the French group, is excluded from the agreement.</p>
