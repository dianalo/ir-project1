<p>Bulgaria, beset by economic crisis and mass anti-government protests, is seeking to compensate workers for hyperinflation which is eroding wages by the hour.</p>
<p>The embattled Socialist government met on Thursday to approve a temporary budget bill aimed at linking wages to the inflation rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Bulgaria has entered a cycle of hyperinflation and it is impossible to predict how far it will go especially if the power vacuum continues,&quot; trade minister Atanas Paparizov told reporters.</p>
<p>The Socialists, formerly the communists, are overseeing a caretaker government while Interior Minister Nikolai Dobrev tries to form a new cabinet.</p>
<p>Buglaria has been rocked by 25 days of protests to demand immediate elections. Dobrev has said he would hold elections within five months but that has failed to satisfy opposition parties.</p>
<p>Strikes and rallies continued around the country on Thursday. Roads were blocked and workers staged one-hour strikes.</p>
<p>The lev sunk to a record low of 1,480 to the dollar from 1,300 on Wednesday and 880 a week ago. Inflation for the first 15 days of January stood at 30.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I am selling all the goods I have in stock and closing. There is no point in marking up prices. Few are buying even at these prices,&quot; said a hardware shop-owner in central Sofia.</p>
<p>The trade unions have demanded the workers be paid weekly and wages be adjusted each time for inflation. At the moment they are paid monthly with sporadic adjustments for inflation.</p>
<p>Many pensioners and some families with children have asked to buy bread or milk on credit, one shopkeeper said.</p>
<p>Economists warned that the worst was yet to come.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be much more horrible than anything the average Bulgarian can imagine. Savers will lose everything, producers will agonise because under hyperinflation the market shrinks beyond recognition,&quot; said Harsev &amp; Co investment house manager Emil Harsev in an interview with Sega weekly magazine.</p>
<p>After a run on deposits on Wednesday, the State Savings Bank assured savers in a televised address that it had enough levs to pay. Calm appeared to return on Thursday.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Lyubomir Filipov told reporters that authorities were not considering blocking deposits at this stage.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) proposed last year the implementation of a fixed exchange rate system, under which levs in circulation must be matched by foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>Introduction of the system was delayed after the Socialists failed to yield to opposition demands for immediate elections.</p>
<p>President Petar Stoyanov, who has said that Bulgaria could default on a $10 billion foreign debt, met the European Union's External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek in Brussels on Thursday.</p>
<p>Van den Broek told him not to expect any new aid from the EU until Bulgaria's political stability was restored.</p>
<p>The IMF has said it was prepared to resume funding talks as soon as a new government is in place.</p>
<p>Economists have proposed full liberalisation of markets, prices and investment incentives as the only way to halt the economic freefall.</p>
