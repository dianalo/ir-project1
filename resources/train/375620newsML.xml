<title>USA: Albright to go online to answer policy queries.</title>
<headline>Albright to go online to answer policy queries.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Concerned about human rights in China? Puzzled by U.S. policy in Bosnia? Now you can send electronic mail to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and ask her to explain.</p>
<p>Just send your query to the e-mail address secretary@state.gov and you are guaranteed a reply -- though not necessarily from Albright herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot guarantee you she's going to personally sit at home every night and answer every e-mail message,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;But I can guarantee people who do send messages to her that they will get a response from the State Department.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She will be given, on a weekly basis, a compilation of all the messages that come in, which ... we'll break down into what subjects people are sending messages about. And in some cases, I think she will be responding,&quot; Burns added.</p>
<p>The system was set up on Thursday, Burns told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Burns also said Albright would make use of the Internet to answer questions from students during a nine-country around-the-world trip she will start on Saturday.</p>
<p>He said she would sit down at the keyboard in Moscow Feb. 20 and hold an &quot;interactive town hall meeting&quot; with students around the world linked by the GLOBE system. GLOBE is a computer-based environment and science education programme linking some 4,000 schools worldwide.</p>
