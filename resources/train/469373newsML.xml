<p>Yemen's Popular Forces Union Party said in a statement on Wednesday it was boycotting next month's parliamentary elections to protest against alleged irregularities in voter registration .</p>
<p>The main internal opposition party, the Yemen Socialist Front (YSP) and two others have already announced a boycott of the April 27 elections, the first since a civil war in 1994 nearly tore apart the Arab world's poorest country.</p>
<p>The YSP won 50 seats in the outgoing assembly, dominated by the General people's Congress (GPC) of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and its junior coalition partner the Islamist Islah Party.</p>
<p>&quot;The results of the elections have already been decided... after the GCP and Islah agreed in advance how they will divide the seats in the chamber through agreement on constituencies,&quot; said Yemen's Popular Forces Union Party in the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;And this would also lead to a division of power between them after the vote,&quot; it added in a statement.</p>
<p>It said that together with seven others in an opposition alliance it failed to get official guarantees the ballot would be fair and free.</p>
<p>The party has support among intellectuals and reformers but has no seats in parliament.</p>
<p>The opposition claims the government has already fixed the election results through multiple registrations by army and security personnel.</p>
<p>Election officials expect about 5,000 candidates to seek votes for 301 parliamentary seats under the banners of 12 parties or as independents in the vote.</p>
<p>Saleh on Saturday invited international observers to monitor the vote.</p>
