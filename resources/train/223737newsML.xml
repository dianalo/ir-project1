<p>Russian Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said on Thursday the government would give subsidies and state investment funds to some key industries but would tell others to stand on their own two feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Our policy will be that of supporting strong companies so that they can become an engine to push Russian industry forward,&quot; Yasin told a news conference after a government meeting on industrial policy for 1997.</p>
<p>He said the government would give the space, nuclear and power sectors investment funds, subsidies and export credits to help them compete on world markets.</p>
<p>But the crucial oil and gas sector, the most profitable branch of Russian industry and the source of most of its export revenues, would get no direct government support.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue is to create a tax regime that will allow it (the energy sector) to finance itself,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yasin, a former academic, said the government would use import tariffs to help other industrial sectors, including automobiles, light industry, textiles, agricultural equipment and road machinery to maintain a position in the domestic market.</p>
<p>These sectors, many of them Soviet-era behemoths, have found it hard to compete with foreign firms on the Russian markets. Imported cars now crowd Moscow's streets, although they remain relatively rare outside the capital and other big cities.</p>
<p>Yasin said high tariffs for such goods would only remain for a transitional period of at least four or five years.</p>
<p>He said the government would only grant credits to these industries for well-backed projects able to guarantee a rapid return on investment. The use of investment credits would be tightly monitored.</p>
<p>Industrial production has halved since Russia launched its economic reform programme in 1992 and there is no sign yet of the long-awaited economic turnaround. Official data show October output was four percent lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p>Government officials have said the prolonged fall is because Russian industry has been slow to adapt to new economic circumstances, including the competitive environment created by the more open market economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We see that Russia's industry (is) in a difficult situation, a hard structual crisis is going on,&quot; Yasin said.</p>
<p>&quot;We see that the methods of supporting industry we have been using so far mainly under the pressure of different lobby groups is only aimed at curbing the fall, not at structural reconstruction.&quot;</p>
