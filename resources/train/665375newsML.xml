<p>Canada's unadjusted May consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in the month and 1.5 percent in the year to 135.7, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>(Corrects All-items Index for May from 135.7 to 137.7)</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of economists had forecast the undadjusted CPI to rise 0.2 percent on the month. The survey also forecast a 1.6 percent year-over-year rise in the all- items and 1.8 percent year-over-year rise in the core CPI.</p>
<p>The core CPI rise of 1.7 percent was well within the Bank of Canada's target inflation range of one to three percent.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada said much of the year's 1.5 percent rise in overall prices stemmed from higher prices for new vehicles, vehicle insurance, post-secondary tuition, meat and tobacco products.</p>
<p>The federal agency said that over the same period, consumers saw lower prices for mortgage loans and gasoline.</p>
<p>May's 1.5 percent monthly increase was the third consecutive month for lower rates of inflation, due mainly to lower annual movements in the energy sector, StatsCan said.</p>
<p>On the month, the 0.1 percent rise in May prices came from higher prices for recreation, food, vehicle registration, gasoline, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, the agency said. Partly offsetting these increases were lower prices for women's clothing, shelter and air transportation.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada said that since May of last year, energy prices have dropped 1.3 percent, due mostly to a 5.4 percent decline in gasoline prices offset by a 6.7 percent rise in piped gas rates, a 7.8 percent rise in fuel oil prices and a 0.8 percent hike in electricity charges.</p>
<p>On the month, energy prices rose 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>Food prices rose 1.6 percent on the year and 0.4 percent on the month in May, StatsCan said. Shoppers saw higher prices for fresh fruit and pork in May.</p>
<p>Recreation costs on the year were up 1.3 percent, primarily due to higher charges for travel accommodation, especially in British Columbia, the agency said.</p>
<p>Vehicle registration fees rose 9.4 percent on the year, due mainly to a hike in Quebec registration fees.</p>
<p>In May, the largest seasonally adjusted monthly rises were a 0.4 percent rise in alcohol and tobacco products and a 0.3 percent increase in food prices, StatsCan said.</p>
