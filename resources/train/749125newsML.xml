<p>Fighting between troops loyal to Cambodia's ousted first prime minister and government forces under strongman Hun Sen eased in northern Cambodia on Wednesday, officials in Phnom Penh and Thailand said.</p>
<p>A Thai army officer, based in northeast Thailand on the border with Cambodia, said there was no heavy fighting for a second day on Wednesday and royalist troops were consolidating their hold on the key town of Samrong which they took back from government forces earlier in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems the situation is calmer today,&quot; the officer told Reuters in Thailand. &quot;They are consolidating their hold on Samrong.&quot;</p>
<p>A Cambodian army officer under Second Prime Minister Hun Sen earlier confirmed that government forces were being pushed back from Samrong, which is some 330 km (200 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh and 30 km (20 miles) from the Thai border.</p>
<p>The officer said royalist forces were being helped by Khmer Rouge guerrillas.</p>
<p>But in Phnom Penh a government spokesman said Hun Sen's forces were meeting little opposition from the royalist troops and denied that royalist forces were still in Samrong.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is quiet. We don't have a lot of resistance,&quot; said Secretary of State for Information Khieu Kanharith.</p>
<p>Thousands of civilians have fled the area of fighting, many heading for Thailand.</p>
<p>Thai authorities estimated about 20,000 Cambodians were waiting at the border and said they would be allowed to cross to Thai soil if the fighting worsened.</p>
<p>The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Tuesday it was concerned that Thailand was not allowing civilians to cross into Thailand and that the UNHCR was not being allowed into the area.</p>
<p>The UNHCR was appealing to authorities in Thailand to open the borders, she said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a bloody coup on July 6 after driving the prince's forces from Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Sporadic fighting between the two sides has continued in the northwest and intensified at the weekend as Hun Sen rejected a regional effort to get peace talks going.</p>
<p>Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on Wednesday warned Ranariddh not to use Thailand as a venue for political manoeuvring.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Thailand was a main supporter of a Cambodian guerrilla alliance which grouped Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, the Khmer Rouge and another small guerrilla faction. They were fighting against the Vietnamese-backed government under Hun Sen in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Chavalit said Thailand would not play a leading role in resolving its neighbour's problems and would only get involved in conjunction with its Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers from ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, on Wednesday met in Kuala Lumpur to formally admit Burma and Laos as full members.</p>
<p>The induction of Cambodia, originally scheduled for the same time, has been postponed due to the conflict in that country.</p>
