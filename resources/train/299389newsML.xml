<p>A new prosecutor in Michigan on Friday dropped assisted suicide and other charges brought against Jack Kevorkian last year.</p>
<p>David Gorcyca, who took office on Jan. 1 as Oakland County prosecutor, said the charges were brought &quot;in haste&quot; by his predecessor, Richard Thompson, and were not backed by full investigations of facts.</p>
<p>Thompson, who brought Kevorkian to trial on assisted suicide charges twice last year and lost both cases, had charged Kevorkian with 19 separate offences in the deaths of 10 people.</p>
<p>In addition to assisted suicide, Kevorkian was charged with possession of a controlled substance, moving bodies without the permission of the medical examiner and with holding himself out to be a practicing physician while engaging in unlawful conduct.</p>
<p>&quot;As to the charges issued on Oct. 31, 1996, I do not feel they could be successfully prosecuted,&quot; Gorcyca told a news conference on Friday. &quot;It will be a waste of taxpayers money and prosecutorial resources to make such a futile effort.&quot;</p>
<p>Kevorkian still faces assisted suicide charges in Ionia, Michigan, for the Aug. 30, 1996, death of a 54-year-old woman there who was initially though to have died from natural causes. He could come to trial in the small western Michigan town as early as February.</p>
<p>The 68-year-old retired pathologist has acknowledged that he has attended at least 45 suicides since 1990. Thompson doggedly pursued Kevorkian, believing that conservative voters in the affluent suburban Detroit county wanted Kevorkian stopped.</p>
<p>But Gorcyca defeated Thompson in the Republican primary for prosecutor last year, and went on to a narrow victory over his Democratic opponent in the November election.</p>
<p>During the campaign, Gorcyca said he doubted that he would continue to prosecute Kevorkian without a clearly enforceable law controlling assisted sucide. On Friday he urged the legislature to pass one, and added that Kevorkian did not have a &quot;blank check&quot; to assist in suicides.</p>
<p>Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, said he was pleased with Gorcyca's decision to drop the charges.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he kept his promise to the electorate,&quot; Fieger said. &quot;It's a decision which is foresighted and enlightened and now ends the climate of persecution and prosecution in Oakland County.&quot;</p>
<p>Fieger called on the medical and legal communities to help draft guidelines for assisted suicide.</p>
