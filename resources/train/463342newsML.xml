<title>MACAU: Macau minister says China arms ban may go - LUSA.</title>
<headline>Macau minister says China arms ban may go - LUSA.</headline>
<dateline>MACAU 1997-03-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Portuguese Defence Minister Antonio Vitorino said on Monday that the current ban on European Union arms sales to China may be lifted soon, the Portuguese national news agency LUSA reported.</p>
<p>&quot;It is natural that the issue (of arms sales) will have to be re-examined&quot; since relations between China and the EU were being normalised, Vitorino was quoted as saying in Beijing.</p>
<p>The faxed LUSA report, monitored by Reuters in Macau, did not specify in what context Vitorino was speaking.</p>
<p>The defence minister arrived in Beijing on Monday on a six-day visit aimed at improving political ties and military cooperation with China.</p>
<p>Vitorino was expected to discuss the 1999 handover of Portuguese-administered Macau to China as well as NATO expansion plans in talks with his Chinese hosts, but would sign no military agreements, LUSA said.</p>
<p>The daily Macau Hoje newspaper said last week that Beijing was interested in selling military equipment to Lisbon, viewing Portugal as a gateway to the European market for Chinese weaponry.</p>
<p>But LUSA quoted the minister as saying on Monday that he was not visiting China &quot;to sell or buy arms&quot;, stressing the issue of arms sales to China could not be solved on an exclusively bilateral level.</p>
<p>The European Union banned arms sales to China following the crackdown on student demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, LUSA noted.</p>
<p>Vitorino would visit units of China's three million-strong People's Liberation Army near Beijing, including an air force guided missile division, LUSA said.</p>
<p>He was scheduled to meet Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian and President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday, and would travel to Xi'an and Shanghai later in the week, it said.</p>
<p>Vitorino's China visit is the first by a Portuguese defence minister since the two countries established diplomatic ties 18 years ago, LUSA said.</p>
