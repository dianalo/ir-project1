<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers this morning. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- More and more young people try drugs, partly as the danger has been played down by techno music, hiphop groups, satellite TV and different data bases, a survey shows.</p>
<p>- Swedish media shares could be boosted when holding company Kinnevik lists its media subsidiary Modern Times Group (MTG) this autumn. Media groups have been lagging behing other shares in the nineties.</p>
<p>- The joint venture Saab-British Aerospace is investing a lot of money to win an order, worth seven to eight billion crowns, for 30 airplanes from the Hungarian air force as this could mean further orders, for example from the Czech Republic, Poland and Latin America.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- The Social Democrats might reorganise the Swedish court system by merging two organisations, a general court and an administrative court, into one.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- Asset management group Brummer &amp; Partners' share fund Zenit is the most profitable in Sweden -- in the second half of 1996 its commission income amounted to 73 million crowns. Zenit takes more than five percent in commission, while most other funds take 1.5 percent. The fund rose 51.6 percent from July 1 to December 31, more than twice as much as the Stockholm Stock Exchange's general index.</p>
<p>- The Riksbank could become more aggressive in critisising government policies after a five-party agreement made it more independent.</p>
