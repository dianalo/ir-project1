<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss give India bank secrets on Bofors arms deal.</title>

<p>Switzerland on Tuesday gave India secret bank documents linked to a billion dollar arms scandal over Swedish artillery after seven years of legal wrangling in Swiss courts over whether to release the papers.</p>
<p>Indian ambassador Kizhakke Pisharath Balakrishnan and the head of India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Joginder Singh, received a sealed box with some 500 pages of documents in a public ceremony.</p>
<p>&quot;We have five pages (of 500) of statements from witnesses. It is not very much but it is important,&quot; Swiss investigator Michel-Andre Fels from the Federal Office for Police Affairs told reporters.</p>
<p>Fels declined to elaborate on the witness statements and officials would say only that most of the documents were from banks in Geneva.</p>
<p>But CBI director Singh said the papers allowed India to begin digging into the case, which stems from India's $1.3 billion artillery deal with Sweden's Bofors arms manufacturers in 1986.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is the real beginning of the case,&quot; Singh said.</p>
<p>India had been trying to discover whether leading Indian politicians took bribes in connection with the arms deal.</p>
<p>Following an Indian investigation which established that Bofors paid millions of dollars into Swiss bank accounts, Indian police asked Switzerland to provide details.</p>
<p>The furore contributed to the defeat in 1989 of the government led by late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was accused by opposition parties of involvement in the affair.</p>
<p>Gandhi, who denied the allegations, was killed in a bomb blast while campaigning for 1991 parliamentary polls.</p>
<p>Swiss police said there was evidence Bofors paid about $40 million into various banks accounts in Switzerland during the time the contract was India drawn up and settled.</p>
<p>Bofors has denied the payments were bribes and said the money was settlement costs to its agents.</p>
<p>India requested the documents in February 1990 but legal wrangling, including a Geneva lower court ruling last year that fair trial would be impossible in India, delayed the transfer of the Geneva bank records until a final decision by the Swiss supreme court last November.</p>
<p>Another batch from Zurich banks was sent to India in December 1990.</p>
<p>Swiss officials said revised laws on international cooperation, due to take effect on February 1, would make it easier for foreign investigators to get their hands on similar records in the future.</p>
<p>The revision drops many opportunities for appeals that had helped slow down the transfer of the Bofors documents from Geneva.</p>
<p>Fels also told reporters the federal police agency had not seen any request from Sweden for records linked to Bofors.</p>
<p>A Swedish newspaper reported on Sunday that a commission investigating the 1986 murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme was seeking Swiss documents on the Indian contract.</p>
<p>Palme, who was shot dead by an unknown assassin in a Stockholm street in February 1986, worked very closely with Gandhi to arrange the Bofors contract. It was finalised a month after his death.</p>
