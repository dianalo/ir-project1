<p>An oil spill from an ageing Russian tanker forced evacuation on Friday of 14 dolphins from an amusement park aquarium, half of them to the city of Kobe which suffered its own disaster two years ago.</p>
<p>In the latest sad twist in a 15-day-old pollution crisis on the northern Japanese coast, the dolphins will be transported by road to five other aquariums around the country where they will stay until the oil is cleaned up.</p>
<p>Seven of the dolphins, including a seven-month-old, were headed for Kobe on the day that it commemorated the second anniversary of an earthquake that devastated the city.</p>
<p>The Echizen Matsushima Aquarium is only one mile (two km) from where the bow of the tanker washed on to rocks. Oil tanks in the bow have so far caused most of the pollution along a 500 km (325 mile) stretch of coast about 300 km (190 miles) west of Tokyo.</p>
<p>The stern of the 26-year-old Nakhodka, which held most of the 19,000-tonne (133,000-barrel) cargo of heavy oil, is also leaking but further out to sea.</p>
<p>The stern went down about 130 km (80 miles) off the coast of Shimane Prefecture shortly after the ship broke up in rough seas on January 2.</p>
<p>Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) authorities warn oil slicks are expanding all the time as winds and tides push oil towards land from the stern.</p>
<p>Six prefectures heavily dependent on fisheries and tourism, are already involved in a non-stop struggle to protect and clean shores dotted with shellfish farms, scenic beaches and marine bird sanctuaries.</p>
<p>According to a survey released on Friday by Japan's Defence Academy, the impact of the spill on marine resources would be minimal because little oil was dissolved by sea water.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil spill should have no effect on deep-sea marine products such as crab,&quot; Haruyuki Yamaguchi of the Defense Academy said.</p>
<p>&quot;On beaches where the oil has washed ashore, the impact should not be as bad as expected because the survey indicates the oil was not absorbed deeply into the sand,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Despite Moscow's decision to send three ships to help with the cleanup, Japan has lashed out at Russia for what it regards as a half-hearted response so far to the leaks.</p>
<p>Russia's Interfax news agency has quoted Russian Transport Minister Nikolai Tsakh as saying preliminary investigation of the wreck of the tanker suggested &quot;there was an external cause due to an explosion&quot; but that a full explanation was not yet available.</p>
<p>The 31-man crew of the tanker, which was heading from China to Russia, was rescued. The captain is missing and presumed dead.</p>
<p>Japan has raised its estimate of oil spilled from the bow to 5,000 tonnes from an earlier 3,700 tonnes.</p>
