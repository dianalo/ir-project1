<p>Diamond exploration company Trans Hex International Ltd said on Friday significant progress had been made in advancing its alluvial diamond exploration projects in Namibia, Indonesia and Brazil.</p>
<p>In a statement on its financial results for the third quarter it said that on the Namibian bank of the Orange river at the Northbank project drilling had outlined in excess of 19 million cubic metres of diamondiferous gravels.</p>
<p>&quot;Both on the South African and Namibian banks...diamonds of above average value, in excess of U.S.$500 per carat have been recovered,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Indonesian marine dredging project, in the shallow waters of the Sunda Shelf off Kalimantan, had advanced to the stage where the first bulk sample site had been stripped of overburden.</p>
<p>Modifications to the washing and screening section of the diamond recovery plant to remove excess clay had been made and the plant was currently undergoing commissioning.</p>
<p>In Brazil, the group had recently completed a regional drilling program which had outlined diamondiferous gravel deposits in paleochannels of the Sono river in Tocantins State.</p>
<p>Bulk sampling of the Bangoran alluvial deposit, in the Central African Republic, had been completed and an assessment of the results by the joint venture partners was in progress, the group said.</p>
<p>It said in the next quarter, exploration work would focus on bulk sampling in Indonesia and detailed drilling to select bulk sample sites in Namibia and Brazil.</p>
<p>The group had cash reserves of C$10 million at December 31 1996 after exploration expenditure in the third quarter of C$4.6 million -- mainly in Indonesia and in Brazil -- and repayment of advances to its parent company.</p>
<p>The group's shares started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on December 20 1996 under the name &quot;THI&quot;.</p>
