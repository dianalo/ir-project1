<p>A former interior minister who quit in a scandal over links between Turkish officials and organised crime testified to a parliamentary inquiry on Thursday, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>It quoted members of the inquiry, which is closed to the media, as saying ex-minister Mehmet Agar refused to answer questions on aspects of the scandal because they were before the courts.</p>
<p>Legal authorities are studying the possibility of lifting Agar's parliamentary immunity to try him on charges of abusing his position.</p>
<p>He has been accused by the media of involvement in the disappearance of a secret service officer and supplying police documents to a fugitive, rightwing gangster.</p>
<p>Agar is an MP from Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's True Path Party, a junior partner in the coalition government.</p>
<p>He defended the reputation of the security forces: &quot;I am with them with all my heart. I am at peace and relaxed enough to give an account of everything,&quot; Anatolian quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Agar resigned last November after the scandal came to light when a senior policeman, a murder suspect and an MP were discovered together in a car involved in a fatal crash.</p>
