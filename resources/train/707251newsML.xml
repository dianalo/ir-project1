<p>Ukraine's Economy Minister Yuri Yekhanurov said on Friday he was confident the International Monetary Fund would decide by the end of the month to grant Ukraine a long-term, multi-billion dollar credit.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Yekhanurov when asked by Reuters whether the IMF, with a mission visiting Kiev until next week, would decide to give Ukraine the three-year, $2.5-3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) this month.</p>
<p>&quot;The talks are going normally and openly. They are prepared for mutual work and they want to help us,&quot; said Yekhanurov, who first met mission members on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the IMF's chief requirements was that Ukraine pass a budget, which we have done. Right now they are evaluating it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>IMF senior officials said last week the funding body was considering replacing the EFF, given to countries implementing deep structural reforms, with an interim stand-by credit until Ukraine met 41 mutually-agreed conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;Fourteen of the points are not fulfilled,&quot; Yekhanurov said.</p>
<p>He said a chief area of contention was IMF demands that Ukraine lower the payroll tax to 40 percent from 48.5 percent, as a first step in legalising an economy which is estimated to be 60 percent off the books.</p>
<p>There were also disagreements over taxes and deregulation, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, since these issues are tied with the process of law-making, Ukraine has not fulfilled them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ukraine's parliament, dominated by conservatives, passed the 1997 budget nearly six months late on June 27 -- and still must approve seven of nine tax laws to underpin the budget.</p>
<p>The EFF would succeed an $867 million stand-by credit which expired in February.</p>
