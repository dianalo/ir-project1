<headline>UK's FTSE seen showing restraint in tracking Dow.</headline>

<p>A further rally by the Dow could lead London's share index even higher into record territory next week, but strategists say the FTSE's gains will continue to lag those scored in the U.S. because of a less favourable domestic economic and political outlook.</p>
<p>London's blue chip share index surged to an all-time high of 4,353.4 on Friday, inspired by a third day of sharp gains in the U.S. which took the Dow industrial's over the 7,000 landmark for the first time.  </p>
<p>But so far this year the Dow has almost doubled the rise seen in leading British shares. The FTSE has risen by 5-1/2 percent since January compared to the Dow's nine percent surge.</p>
<p>Economists say domestic worries are increasingly restraining the London market. The proximity to a general election, the persistent strength of sterling, the weakening corporate earnings trend and the inflation and interest rate environment have all dulled investors appetites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dow has risen by over 1,000 points in just four months, adding 216 points in the last three days alone, amid growing optimism over the U.S. economy.  </p>
<p>Steady inflation, strong corporate profits, low interest rates and a strong dollar have all helped to fuel the market's exuberance.</p>
<p>UK equities have fewer incentives to justify the current demanding valuation of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The background of a weakening earnings trend has really distinguished us from the U.S. and particularly the rest of Europe,&quot; said Paul O'Connor, UK equities strategist at BZW.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not particularly upbeat about the FTSE from here,&quot; he added, pointing out that his year-end forecast for the index remains at 4,300.  </p>
<p>&quot;Looking ahead we have political uncertainty and valuations are still stretched.</p>
<p>&quot;The real key that could change our outlook would be a change in policy mix after the election,&quot; said O'Connor. A tightening of policy would help gilts, take the heat off short rates and sterling, and also boost company earnings, he said.</p>
<p>Investors here are also wary of the recent wild swings in the U.S. stock market, fearing that a sudden turnaround could hurt British stocks. &quot;With the Dow looking so strong at the moment we can't rule out further upside in the FTSE,&quot; said Richard Jeffrey, head of research at Charterhouse Tilney.  </p>
<p>&quot;But having said that, I think the Dow is approaching the top of its justifiable valuation range, the upside is very limited now and it might even be entering dangerous territory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think in London we have to start being very wary about the implications of the Dow moving much higher,&quot; Jeffrey said.</p>
<p>Scheduled economic news on retail sales in the UK and consumer prices in the U.S. next Wednesday will help provide a focus for investors, giving fresh evidence of how both economies are faring. Elsewhere, analysts will be studying British corporate results to see how the strong pound has affected companies' earnings outlooks.  </p>
<p>Among the FTSE 100 companies reporting results next week are Barclays Bank and SmithKline Beecham on Tuesday and BOC Group Plc and Rank Group Plc on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Monday, trading will begin in shares of Centrica, the gas supply arm demerged from British Gas Plc a week ago. British Gas will be quoted under the name BG Plc.</p>
