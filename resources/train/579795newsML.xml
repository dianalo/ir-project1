<p>The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on Tuesday blamed Kazakh Airlines for the world's worst mid-air collision when one of its aircraft collided with a Saudi Arabia Airlines Boeing 747.</p>
<p>N.A.K. Sarma, lawye representing the AAI in a probe into the accident, said it occured after the Kazakh Ilyushin Il-76 failed to maintain the height assigned to it by the air traffic control (ATC) at New Delhi airport.</p>
<p>&quot;The mid-air collision occured because the Kazakhstan aircraft descended below FL (flight level) 150, the level it had been assigned and directed to maintain by Delhi ATC, and the aircraft came to occupy FL-140, at which assigned level the Saudi Boeing aircraft was flying. This is the direct cause of the collision,&quot; Sarma said in a written submission.</p>
<p>The submissions were made in a special court of enquiry probing the collision near Delhi last November 12. All 349 on board the two aircraft were killed.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia Airlines last month submitted its account of the collision, in which it also blamed the Kazakh cargo plane for the accident.</p>
<p>Air traffic control had assigned a corridor of 15,000 feet to the Kazakh airliner and 14,000 feet to the Saudi plane, and the crash would not have taken place if both had stuck to their respective corridors, Sarma said.</p>
<p>Kazakh Airlines' lawyer Duli Chand Singhania contended that air turbulence had caused the plane to lose height and led to the accident.</p>
<p>&quot;It is fairly clear from the findings of the two institutes in Moscow and London that there was air turbulence which could have caused the Kazakh plane to fall and might have caused the accident,&quot; Singhania told Reuters.</p>
<p>Britain's Air Accident Investigation Branch and the Aviation Institute at Moscow decoded the flight recorders of the two planes.</p>
<p>&quot;For a plane to lose nearly 1,000 feet it requires severe air turbulences and according to the meteorological department's reports, there were no turbulences severe enough to cause such a fall,&quot; Sarma said.</p>
<p>Singhania added that the Kazakh airliner received instructions from the ATC much too late when the Saudi plane was heading in its direction.</p>
<p>&quot;The Kazakh crew was intimated only 38 seconds before the crash that they were in the same line as the Saudi plane, and by then it was too late to take any corrective measures,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The accident also happened due to a lack of communication between the Kazakh crew, which could have led to a loss of precious seconds, Sarma added.</p>
<p>&quot;The pilots who handled the cockpit did not know what the radio operator said or heard in English. The radio operator did not know what the pilots were doing. There was no coordination or involved approach,&quot; Sarma said.</p>
