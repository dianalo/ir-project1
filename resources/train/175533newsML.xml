<p>Freight forwarders in Europe are opposing cargo surcharges announced by airlines to compensate for sharply higher jet fuel costs, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Pressure from forwarders and shippers could result in the surcharges being removed on anti-competitive grounds, while the alternative of a rise in actual air cargo rates rise might not stand up to market forces, they added.</p>
<p>The surcharges average US10 cents a kg, or the equivalent in local currency, with small variations on some routes. This could be seen &quot;as reflecting a common, agreed increase,&quot; by airlines, one source said.</p>
<p>&quot;If a single closed group (the airlines) can impose a standard surcharge and specify it as such on an airway bill.... that could be seen as being against competition. In practice that's a cartel decision,&quot; the expert added.</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is holding an emergency meeting on November 13 in Geneva to discuss &quot;concerted action&quot; on how to tackle the question of rising fuel costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a move would surely be opposed by the European Commission's competition authority....it is very close to unfair trade,&quot; said Sandro Consolido who coordinates airfreight matters at the Zurich-based freight forwarders internaional association, FIATA.</p>
<p>Consolido told Reuters in a telephone interview that FIATA's European country organisations are also likely to approach their relevant national competition authorities once evidence of a common surcharge is available.</p>
<p>&quot;And if a surcharge can't work because of the competition implications, then the alternative left to the airlines is to increase actual market rates,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case market forces will come into play. Rates can be set individually for each forwarder but if there is what appears to be an unjustified increase, forwarders can move their business to those carriers which have not introduced a rate rise,&quot; Consolido said. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017</p>
