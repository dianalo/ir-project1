<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were little changed in featureless trade, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said most traders were sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. August producer price index and weekly jobless claims data.</p>
<p>The producer price index for August is forecast to show an increase of 0.1 percent compared with a 0.2 percent gain reported in July. Weekly jobless claims for the week ended September 7 is expected to be around 329,000 against the previous week's 316,000.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market was quiet and featureless in the morning due mainly to an absence of fresh incentives. The market is waiting for tonight's producer price index and weekly jobless claims figures for more clues to market direction,&quot; a local dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't think there will be much impact here as the numbers have been built into the market and most people have squared or are squaring their positions,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, Thursday/Friday and weekend were unchanged from Wednesday's common 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent, respectively.  </p>
<p>Week-fixed eased 1/16 percentage point to 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent.</p>
<p>Among longer dates, one-month was unchanged from Wednesday's 5-1/2 5-3/8 percent, three-months unchanged at 5-5/8 5-1/2, six-months unchanged at 5-7/8 5-3/4 and twelve-months unchanged at 6-3/16 6-1/16 percent.</p>
