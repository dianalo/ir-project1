<title>BURMA: Burmese bomb blast kills official's daughter.</title>
<headline>Burmese bomb blast kills official's daughter.</headline>

<p>A bomb exploded at the house of one of Burma's top military officials, killing his daughter and setting off a renewed security alert in the capital, sources close to the family and diplomats said on Monday.</p>
<p>A bomb exploded at the house of Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, Secretary Two of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and Chief of Staff, Army, on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Sources close to the family said Tin Oo's eldest daughter was killed in the blast.</p>
<p>&quot;We heard there was a bomb blast yesterday night at the house of Secretary Two and his eldest daughter died because of the blast,&quot; one source close to the family told Reuters. The daughter's name and age were not given.</p>
<p>Government officials confirmed the attack but would not say if Tin Oo's daughter was killed.</p>
<p>&quot;The incident is correct. It is still under consideration and we will send you the details,&quot; a spokesman told Reuters. When asked about Tin Oo's daughter he said information on the subject would be issued later.</p>
<p>Another person might also have been injured in the blast, which was said to have occurred at about 8:30 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Sunday, one diplomat said. Officials did not say if Tin Oo was in the house at the time of the blast.</p>
<p>Heightened security was apparent on Monday on Rangoon streets. Armed troops and police stood on many streets although they were not seen stopping pedestrians or vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;This just adds to all the other tensions,&quot; said one diplomat. &quot;Now there are streams of troops in the streets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The big question now is who did this,&quot; said another diplomat. &quot;Not only is it disgusting but it raises all sorts of questions about terrorism and national security.&quot;</p>
<p>Burma's military government has been on top security alert since late December when two bombs exploded at a Buddhist shrine in Rangoon, killing five and wounding 17.</p>
<p>The government blamed the attack on the Karen National Union (KNU) guerrilla group, which has denied responsibility.</p>
<p>Tin Oo is one of the hardliners in the government, and often gives speeches urging troops and citizens to &quot;annihilate&quot; anyone who opposes the government and anyone seen trying to undermine the stability of the nation.</p>
<p>Burma has been rocked by unrest over recent months, with rare student demonstrations in December followed by the bomb blast at the Buddhist shrine.</p>
<p>In mid-March religious troubles between Buddhist monks and Moslems erupted and the government imposed a curfew in some areas and several restrictive measures in an effort to curb the violence and unrest.</p>
<p>The government had sent hundreds of troops to patrol the streets ahead of the March 27 Armed Forces Day. Authorities said top officials feared a terrorist attack around that day, when all of Burma's top military brass would be together in the capital.</p>
