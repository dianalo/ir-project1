<title>TURKEY: Iraq slams Turkish security zone plan.</title>
<headline>Iraq slams Turkish security zone plan.</headline>

<p>Turkey and Iraq began talks on Tuesday on a Turkish bid to set up a security zone in northern Iraq that Baghdad slammed as &quot;provocative behaviour&quot; inspired by the United States.</p>
<p>Hamed Youssef Hummadi, an adviser to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and two other Iraqi officials went into a meeting with a leading Turkish general and foreign ministry officials at the ministry.</p>
<p>Iraq blamed Turkey's NATO ally Washington for the plan to set up a Turkish buffer zone of up to 10 km (six miles) deep in northern Iraq to stem infiltration by Turkish Kurd guerrillas.</p>
<p>&quot;The Turkish provocative behaviour to set up a so-called security zone is not a unilateral (initiative), rather it is clearly backed by the United States of America,&quot; Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf said in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p>
<p>The letter was quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA).</p>
<p>Turkey's plan has drawn fire from much of the Arab world as well as Russia and France but Washington has said it understands Turkey's need for a temporary security zone against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels based in the mountains of north Iraq.</p>
<p>Turkey often strikes across the border at the rebels but a six-week drive into Iraq last year involving 30,000 Turkish troops failed to dislodge the PKK.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported a large buildup of Turkish troops on the 330-km (200-mile) border last week. &quot;Turkey has deployed large numbers of its armed forces along what it called the temporary buffer zone,&quot; al-Sahaf said in his letter.</p>
<p>Western diplomats say the proposed cordon was likely to be a free-fire zone where Turkish troops based on their own side of the border would cross in and out in search of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Egypt said on Tuesday it had Turkish guarantees that no Turkish troops would enter Iraqi territory to set up the zone.</p>
<p>Egyptian presidential adviser Osama el-Baz told reporters: &quot;Turkey has told Egypt that it will absolutely not go into Iraqi territory... Any Turkish measures to protect its borders will be taken inside the Turkish border, whether they take the form of an early warning system or any other security system.&quot;</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak discussed the plan with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel by phone on Monday.</p>
<p>Northern Iraq has been held by Iraqi Kurdish groups since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>A Baghdad-backed Iraqi faction, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), said on Monday it was in control of the whole of the region after capturing northern Iraq's biggest city from its rivals, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).</p>
