<headline>Toronto stocks end slightly down ahead of U.S. data.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toronto stocks slipped 13.13 points on Monday to close at 6537.47 on broad-based selling, as 11 of the Toronto Stock Exchange's 14 sub-indexes fell.</p>
<p>Trading was thin, with 31.3 million shares worth $1.01 billion changing hands. Declines outpaced advances 519 to 433, with 322 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>Banks, led by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, were among the few gaining sectors, while golds, metals and forest products led the decliners.</p>
<p>Traders said the market is jittery ahead of U.S. consumer prices data for May, which is due out on Tuesday. Lower-than-expected consumer prices would add to the speculation that the Federal Reserve is not likely to raise rates at the monetary policy meeting July 1-2.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey of economists has forecast that May CPI will show a rise of 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>Last week's softer-than-expected U.S. producer price index and retail sales data added to the speculation that a rate increase was unlikely. But some analysts have cautioned that Federal Reserve members have warned that the U.S. central bank will seek to pre-empt a rise in inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy rather than react to one.</p>
<p>&quot;If they are going to be anticipatory, they'll be moving before we have any clear evidence that inflation is emerging,&quot; said Roy Palmer, analyst with TD Securities.</p>
<p>In individual issues Bombardier Corp. said today it won a $209.2 million Boeing Co. contract. The airplane maker is expected to announce later this week a $1.2 billion order from AMR Corp. for 67 of its 50-seat regional jets.</p>
<p>Stampeder Exploration Ltd. announced a stock offering and a big increase in spending. Stampeder said it planned to use the proceeds of its offering to fund stepped up heavy oil drilling and not takeovers.</p>
