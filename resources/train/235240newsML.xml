<title>ITALY: Illegal immigrants held in Italy, Turks arrested.</title>
<headline>Illegal immigrants held in Italy, Turks arrested.</headline>
<dateline>CROTONE, Italy 1996-12-04</dateline>

<p>Police arrested the eight-man crew of a Turkish ship on Wednesday after they dropped 103 illegal immigrants, who thought they were arriving in northern Italy, off the country's southern coast.</p>
<p>Customs police said the crew, seven Turks and an Egyptian, were arrested after the 400 tonne &quot;Attila Kaptan&quot; was intercepted by a navy corvette some five miles out to sea and forced under escort into the port of Crotone.</p>
<p>All were charged with criminal association aimed at introducing illegal immigrants into the country.</p>
<p>Police said the immigrants, picked up on three liferafts before dawn in high seas, told them they were from Iraq, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan and had embarked on the boat in Istanbul for between $5,000 and $8,000 a head.</p>
<p>Many of them thought they were off the coast of northern Italy and had intended to make their way to Germany.</p>
<p>Police doctor Orlando Amodeo, who visited the detained immigrants, said many were in poor health due to the freezing conditions in the hold of the Turkish merchant ship.</p>
<p>Raffaele Gallucci, the chief of police in Crotone, said investigators had looked at the ship's documents and believed it had been involved in some of five previous landings of illegal immigrants off the Calabrian port in recent months.</p>
<p>The papers also showed other routes leading to the southern region of Puglia and other parts of Calabria.</p>
<p>In an unrelated incident, two police patrol boats blocked a Tunisian ship off the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa with 42 North Africans on board.</p>
<p>Two crew members were arrested and repatriation proceedings undertaken against the illegal immigrants on board.</p>
<p>Island officials say well over 3,000 illegal immigrants have arrived in Lampedusa from nearby Tunisia this year alone, lured by lax immigration laws and the dream of a job in Europe.</p>
