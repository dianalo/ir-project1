<headline>Polish Senate passes 20, 32, 44 pct tax scale.</headline>

<p>The Polish Senate amended the lower house's income tax bill and introduced income tax levels of 20, 32 and 44 percent in 1997, the Senate speaker said.</p>
<p>Senators voted 44 to 33 with nine abstentions in favour of lowering tax levels from this year's 21, 33 and 45 percent, which implies that the 1997 budget deficit will be about 2.8 percent of gross domestic product, according to Finance Ministry estimates.  </p>
<p>The tax scale adopted by the Senate on Thursday was one of the alternatives the government said it was ready to accept.</p>
<p>The government's own proposals for a slightly deeper cut to 20, 31 and 43 percent was defeated in the lower house, which adopted a four-level tax scale of 17, 20, 33 and 45 percent sharply cutting taxes for the lowest-paid.</p>
<p>The ruling coalition's junior partner, the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), which helped defeat the government scheme in the lower house, said it would try to uphold the four-level scale, when the bill returns there for the final reading.  </p>
<p>&quot;The proposal to cut taxes for the poorest was rejected and it would be reasonable for us to uphold our position during the lower house vote,&quot; Peasant leader Waldemar Pawlak told public television after the Senate vote.</p>
<p>The government has said the four-level tax scale, supported by the Peasants and much of the opposition, would lead to a much wider budget gap and threaten inflation far above the 13 percent target set by the government for December 1997. @</p>
<p>President Aleksander Kwasniewski, linked to the coalition's dominant Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) party, has supported the government's arguments and suggested he would veto any tax bill that might lead to higher inflation.</p>
<p>The Polish legislature is debating taxes at the last moment as these by law must be set by November 30 to come into force.</p>
<p>The lower house on Thurday began debating the 1997 budget, the shape of which will be largely determined by the tax levels.</p>
<p>The tax level decision adopted by the Senate on Thursday also specifies that income tax should be levied in 1998 at 19, 30 and 40 percent. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700</p>
