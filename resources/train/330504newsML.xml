<dateline>SEATTLE 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Phamis Inc on Friday said it expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of about $0.10 per share, lower than analysts' estimates and the company's own forecasts.</p>
<p>Analysts on average had estimated Phamis' fourth-quarter earnings at $0.14 per share, according to a First Call survey. Last year, the company earned $0.15 per share in its fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Phamis' estimate for the 1996 fourth quarter does not include a previously announced special charge of $500,000 related to the signing of a development contract with London-based Chelsea &amp; Westminster Healthcare NHS Trust.</p>
<p>Phamis, which provides healthcare information systems to large and mid-sized providers, said its earnings were hurt by a major hardware sale being postponed to 1997. It also said severe weather conditions hampered operations in November and December.</p>
<p>The company said its outlook for 1997 was bullish. It expects to exceed analysts' earnings estimate of $0.70 per share for 1997.</p>
<p>It also expects to report a revenue backlog of more than $85 million as of December 31.</p>
