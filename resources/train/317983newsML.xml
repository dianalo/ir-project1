<p>Barcelona's young Brazilian star Ronaldo, who has taken the Spanish league by storm in his first season, was crowned FIFA world player of the year on Monday.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Ronaldo received more than double the points of his nearest rival, last year's winner George Weah of AC Milan, in a poll of more than 100 international soccer coaches.</p>
<p>England captain Alan Shearer of Newcastle was third in the run-off which featured three of the soccer world's top marksmen.</p>
<p>The young Brazilian, top scorer in the Spanish league with 15 goals this season, received 329 points under the poll's system of voting, against 140 for Weah and 123 for Shearer.</p>
<p>The award, the sixth time it has been made, was to be officially presented at a glittering ceremony later on Monday in Lisbon's Belem Cultural Centre.</p>
<p>Ronaldo is the second Brazilian to win after Romario was acclaimed the world's best player in 1994. Other past winners are Italy's Roberto Baggio, Dutchman Marco Van Basten and Lothar Matthaeus of Germany.</p>
<p>The young Brazilian, regarded by many as the most exciting player to emerge since Argentina's Diego Maradona, is so highly prized by Barcelona that they recently bound him to the club for 10 years with a multi-million dollar contract.</p>
<p>Dubbed the &quot;extra-terrestrial&quot; by soccer-mad Spanish fans, the shaven-haired Ronaldo made an explosive start to the season with Barcelona.</p>
<p>He likes nothing better than to pick up the ball in midfield and head for goal, his extraordinary balance and strength enabling him to appear to bounce off defenders.</p>
<p>His modesty has also won him admirers beyond the massed ranks of Barcelona supporters.</p>
<p>Asked at a press conference in Lisbon earlier on Monday what ambitions he would have left if he won the FIFA award, Ronaldo replied that he wanted to &quot;help Barcelona and Brazil&quot; win many trophies.</p>
<p>George Weah, whose attendance at the ceremony was in doubt up to the last moment, was due to receive a special FIFA award for fair-play.</p>
<p>The Liberian, Africa's most prominent player, faces a court action for damages in Portugal after breaking Porto defender Jorge Costa's nose in an incident at the end of a bad-tempered European Cup league match between the Portuguese champions and AC Milan last November.</p>
<p>Weah, who says he was severely provoked by Costa, feared legal problems and a hostile reception in Lisbon and FIFA managed to confirm his presence only hours before the ceremony was due to begin.</p>
