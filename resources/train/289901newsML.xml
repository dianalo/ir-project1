<p>Indonesia's non-oil revenue is projected to rise by 14.2 percent to 73.18 trillion rupiah in the 1997/98 (April/March) fiscal year from an estimated 64.08 trillion rupiah in the current year, officials said.  </p>
<p>In data made available ahead of President Suharto's 1996/97 budget speech to parliament on Monday, the government said revenue sources would include import duties, export taxes and value-added tax.</p>
<p>Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance Saleh Affif told a briefing that non-oil exports were expected to rise by 14.2 percent in 1997/98.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-oil exports in the coming year are expected to rise by 14.2 percent, while total exports are estimated to rise by 8.6 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that the rise in non-oil exports would be made possible by the development of export-oriented industries.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past few months, we have seen the rapid growth of exports in electronic products and yarn by export-oriented factories which have just started exporting goods,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The data also said income from value-added tax rose by 12.9 percent to 24.60 trillion rupiah in 1997/98 from 21.78 trillion rupiah in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad  said total revenue from oil would account for 16.9 percent of overall budgeted income in 1997/98, compared with 18.1 percent in the 1996/97 budget.</p>
