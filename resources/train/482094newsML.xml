<p>NYMEX crude ended Wednesday at its lowest level in more than year after weekly oil inventory data showed burgeoning supply driven by rising imports.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this was a recognition of the bearish API numbers which indicated the market is well supplied. We have known this for some time though,&quot; said Prudential Securities analyst Richard Redash in New York.</p>
<p>May crude ended off 81 cents at $19.47 a barrel, crude's lowest close since March 4, 1996 when it closed at $19.20.  </p>
<p>May crude fell to a session low of $19.35, spot crude's lowest intraday point since March 11, 1996 when it fell to $19.21.</p>
<p>After falling almost $3.00 a barrel since mid-March of this year, May crude buckled into a decisive contango, ending seven cents under June.</p>
<p>This is the second time within a month spot crude entered contango. Contango is when the nearby contract is cheaper than the later contract. May gasoline ended off 2.06 cents at 60.61 cents a gallon while May heating oil ended off 1.43 cents at 52.52 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>&quot;With gasoline falling with crude, we have removed from the market the one bullish underpinning that the market has been relying on to take us higher,&quot; said Redash.</p>
<p>Gasoline typically rallies in the spring in anticipation of the summer driving season when gasoline demand peaks.</p>
<p>However, the American Petroleum Institute's (API) weekly oil inventory data for the week ended March 28 indicated refined product output has increased markedly, with refinery utilization rates rising 0.9 percentage point to 93.6 percent after rising 2.3 percentage points the week before.</p>
<p>Analysts said the high output could eliminate the year-over-year gasoline stock deficit, which stands at 5.4 million barrels, by the end of April.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the API said crude stocks grew 6.4 million barrels compared to the one to three million barrels expected by traders.</p>
<p>What is most bearish about the report, dealers said, is that crude stocks are 17.6 million barrels above year ago levels in the U.S. Gulf region, where refinery demand is concentrated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the report showed stocks were 2.1 million barrels above a year ago in the midcontinent region, where the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is delivered.</p>
<p>Imports rose sharply to 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd) from 6.8 million bpd due to an influx of West African crude.</p>
