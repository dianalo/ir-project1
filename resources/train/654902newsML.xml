<title>JAPAN: Kobe to boost aluminium HDD disc output.</title>
<headline>Kobe to boost aluminium HDD disc output.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-06-11</dateline>

<p>Kobe Steel Ltd said on Wednesday it plans to boost its production of aluminium disc blanks for hard disc drives (HDD) to 27 million units per month by March, 1998.</p>
<p>Kobe's current monthly production of aluminium disc blanks is about 20 million, equivalent to 350 tonnes, giving the company a roughly 50 percent share of the world market, a Kobe spokesman said.</p>
<p>Kobe's output of aluminium disc blanks is likely to jump to 40 million units a month by March, 1999, depending on HDD demand, he said. One HDD uses several aluminium disc blanks.</p>
<p>&quot;We can boost production to 27 million using existing facilities, without any new investment, but we would need new investment to boost output to 40 million discs,&quot; said Susumu Tamiya, a Kobe director and the head of its Moka aluminium plant.</p>
<p>He added, however, that the level of investment was unlikely to be large. The Moka plant mainly produces 3.5-inch aluminium disc blanks.</p>
<p>The Moka plant produces 15,000 tonnes per month of aluminium beverage can sheet, its mainstay product in which it holds a 50 percent share of the domestic market.</p>
<p>Kobe aims to boost sales of aluminium products for other uses, including automobiles.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a drastic increase in sales of aluminium products for use in cars in or after the year 2000,&quot; Tamiya said. He gave no specific targets, although Kobe's current sales in the sector total 1,203 tonnes a month.</p>
<p>Carmakers use aluminium products in air conditioners, radiators and other components.</p>
<p>Aluminium has attracted interest from carmakers worldwide due to its light weight, which helps improve gasoline mileage and cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) recently said the share of steel products in the raw materials used to make cars is expected to fall to 52.1 percent in calendar 1997 from 54.9 percent in 1992, while aluminium's share is expected to rise to 7.5 percent from 6.0 percent.</p>
