<title>USA: Ruiz Massieu drug money case opens in Houston.</title>
<headline>Ruiz Massieu drug money case opens in Houston.</headline>

<p>A civil trial expected to include revelations about high-level drug corruption in Mexico opened on Monday in a Houston federal court as the U.S. government attempted to seize $9 million from the Texas bank account of a former Mexican deputy attorney general.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors allege the account held drug proceeds paid out to Mario Ruiz Massieu, who headed Mexico's anti-drug efforts in the early 1990s and allegedly pocketed millions of dollars in bribes to protect traffickers smuggling tonnes of cocaine and marijuana across the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Ruiz Massieu said in court filings that the money was part of a family fortune made in real estate and business and was moved to the United States for safekeeping in the event of political or economic turmoil in Mexico.</p>
<p>After seating a jury of three women and five men, U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Atlas scheduled opening arguments in the civil forfeiture case for 3:15 p.m. EST (2015 GMT).</p>
<p>Prosecutors in a final pre-trial hearing on Monday said the week-long trial would not touch on court proceedings in New Jersey that could send Ruiz Massieu back to Mexico to face an embezzlement charge, and would not include allegations of money laundering.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not trying Mr. Massieu. That is not the issue here. The issue is that money and how it got here,&quot; Assistant U.S. Attorney Jesse Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>Rodriguez said Ruiz Massieu had tried to have the money transferred to a Swiss bank hours before it was seized in March 1995 under federal drug forfeiture laws.</p>
<p>Ruiz Massieu fled Mexico in 1995 in the face of narcotics-related corruption charges, and remains under a house arrest in New Jersey after a court there refused to extradite him back to Mexico.</p>
<p>The trial opened against a backdrop of increasing tensions on both sides of the border following President Bill Clinton's recent decision to recertify Mexico as a U.S. ally in the war on drugs.</p>
<p>A push in Congress to block the recertification drew sharp protests last week from leaders of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which said it was an attempt to destabilise the country.</p>
