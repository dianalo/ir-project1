<headline>Russian MinFins dip on fresh US data after rise.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-04-30</dateline>

<p>Russian MinFin bonds edged down after U.S. GDP statistics renewed expectations of a possible U.S. rate hike but stayed above Tuesday's close after an early rise following U.S. Treasuries, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>			tranche   Apr 30		  Apr 29</p>
<p>    1999 maturity   (3)     85.25-85.55	   85.25-85.55</p>

<p>Annualised U.S. Gross Domestic Product  aUSGDP (GDP) rose 5.6 pct in the first quarter, against a forecast 4.1 percent rise and 3.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>The GDP price index rose 2.7 percent compared with forecast 2.1 percent rise and 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>MinFins started to ease after the data, tracking weaker U.S. Treasury bond prices, which often show the way for MinFins.</p>
<p>&quot;MinFins are falling as the figures implied not good news for Treasuries,&quot; Most Bank dealer Alexander Rodionov said.</p>
<p>He added prices had been rising in early trading continuing Tuesday's trend caused by first quarter employment cost index data.</p>
<p>Dealers said the third to seventh MinFin tranches had met resistance at 85.60, 61.00, 42.80, 48.70 and 37.60 respectively after which the opposite move started.</p>
<p>They added Russian banks preferred to keep flat positions ahead of Russia's and MinFin market holidays.</p>
<p>Russian markets are closed on May 1 and 2 for the May Day holidays followed by Victory Day on May 9. The MinFin market is closed from May 7 until May 14 due to annual coupon payment.</p>
<p>Further important U.S. data will be released this week, which will be closely watched for signs of inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The April NAPM report comes on Thursday, and on Friday the all-important employment report for April will hit the market.</p>
<p>On May 20 the U.S. policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets and could raise U.S. interest rates.</p>
