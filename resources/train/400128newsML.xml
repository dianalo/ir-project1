<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends up, but off session highs.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends up, but off session highs.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-25</dateline>

<p>CSCE coffee futures ended moderately higher on Tuesday, boosted by trade and speculative buying amid persistent supply concerns, dealers said.</p>
<p>But light profit taking around the ring and funds rolling spot March into second-month May capped the market and pushed prices toward the middle of the day's range.</p>
<p>Most-active May coffee rose 1.60 cents per lb on the day, to end at 163.25 cents, after ranging between 165.40 and 160.65 cents. Spot March closed 0.70 cent higher, to 174.15 cents, while the back months finished 1.20 lower to 0.80 lower.</p>
<p>The nearby March/May switch narrowed to 10.90 cents, up from 11.80 cents at the close Monday, while May/July widened to 6.90 cents from 6.50 cents the previous session.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes said supply woes were rekindled this week after a Colombia National Coffee Growers' Federation official said a &quot;drastic drop&quot; in the country's output during the current coffee year justified market fears about tight supply.</p>
<p>Revising previous estimates of Colombia's production in the 1996/97 coffee year, John Naranjo said output could drop as low as 10.4 million 60-kg bags, from 12.9 million bags in 1995/96.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still concern about the Colombian crop being smaller,&quot; Ganes said, adding that some projections pointed to a crop under 10 million bags.</p>
<p>But after coffee futures surged some 50 percent since the start of the year on worries about tight supplies and poor Colombian and Brazilian crop prospects, traders said the market appeared to be settling down a bit.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing profit taking with more regularity now,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;It seems to be calming down and going into a range.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, traders said the May contract would face near-term resistance seen at 167.00-167.50, then 168.50 and 173.00, May's life-of-contract high set last week. To the downside, they noted 160.00 level, which has held the last two session, should continue to provide good support.</p>
<p>Turnover on Tuesday reached an estimated 9,693 lots, up from Monday's official tally of 6,800 lots.</p>
