<p>Palestinian officials said on Monday Israel and the PLO would reach a Hebron deal by the end of the day and Israeli troops would withdraw from most of the West Bank town in a week.</p>
<p>&quot;Redeployment from Hebron will take place a week after the announcement of an agreement,&quot; negotiator Mohammad Dahlan, the head of Palestinian preventive security in the Gaza Strip, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Dahlan went into talks with Israeli negotiators in Jerusalem on Monday to iron out final disputes holding up the deal.</p>
<p>He said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were preparing to meet on Tuesday to seal the long-overdue agreement.</p>
<p>Chief Palestinian security negotiator Abdel Razak al-Yihye told reporters on his way into the talks: &quot;We expect to conclude negotiations on Hebron today. We expect an agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Hebron is the last of seven occupied West Bank cities Israel agreed to give self-rule to under an agreement signed with the PLO in 1995. The PLO took over much of the Gaza Strip in 1994.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton's Middle East envoy Dennis Ross was due back in the region on Monday to mediate any last-minute snags and attend the signing.</p>
<p>Underscoring tensions in Hebron, Israeli troops arrested several Palestinian construction workers on Monday after Jewish settlers complained they were doing work close to a Jewish enclave in the town, Palestinian witnesses said.</p>
<p>Security concerns have held up the handover in Hebron, including demands by Netanyahu for additional measures he says are needed to protect the 400 Jewish settlers in the heart of the town of 100,000 Arabs.</p>
<p>Under the 1995 accord, Hebron was due to have been given self-rule nine months ago.</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai met Arafat on Sunday and later told reporters the two sides were aiming to remove all obstacles to the deal by late on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that by tomorrow evening we'll find solutions to the subjects that remain in dispute,&quot; he said after the 90-minute meeting on Sunday night in the self-ruled Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that the new year, 1997, will be the year of solving all of the unsolved problems,&quot; Arafat told their joint news conference at the Palestinian police station where their late-night meeting took place.</p>
<p>Officials have said the signing could take place on Tuesday, the last day of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the meeting between me and His Excellency, the prime minister, will be very soon,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>He said the sides had yet to resolve a question of Palestinian participation in patrols near the Tomb of the Biblical Patriarch Abraham, known to Moslems as al-Ibrahimi mosque. The tomb is due to remain under Israeli control.</p>
<p>Arafat also said he still hoped they would agree on Israel's release of more Palestinian prisoners the day of the signing.</p>
<p>The right-wing Netanyahu, who ousted Nobel prize laureate Shimon Peres as prime minister in May on a promise of better security, reminded the world on Sunday that a Hebron deal did not mean Jews would leave the town.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who tells you we are leaving Hebron is telling you a lie. We're there and we're there forever,&quot; he told students.</p>
