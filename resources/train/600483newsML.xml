<p>Chinese aluminum consumption is set to grow sharply over the coming years in all product areas, said S. Tim Tu, president of United Metals Enterprise Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Aluminum consumption in the Eastern half of China alone could reach six to 10 kg per person annually early in the next century, Tu said.</p>
<p>He gave a presentation at Alumitech, an industry forum organised by the U.S. Aluminum Association.</p>
<p>The eastern region represents half of China's 1.8 billion population, and Tu said his per capita forecast indicated consumption of 6.0 million tonnes of semi finished aluminum products per year, and could reach as high as 10 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Tu based his forecast on studies from the packaging, transportation and construction sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth figures from the best analysts, based on consuming trends of these products, probably put total market in the same ballpark,&quot; Tu said.</p>
<p>Consumption for rolled products was set to rise from 1.25 million tonnes in 1995 to 1.5 million tonnes in 1997, and 1.8 million in 1999, Tu said.</p>
<p>Extrusion products consumption was expected to increase from 400,000 tonnes in 1995 to 440,000 tonnes in 1997, and 500,000 tonnes in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Our best guess for flat products consumption would be 1.5 million tonnes for the year of 1997, with a 10 percent per annum growth rate,&quot; Tu said.</p>
