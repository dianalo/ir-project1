<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia records lowest inflation for four years.</title>
<headline>Australia records lowest inflation for four years.</headline>

<p>Australia recorded its lowest annual inflation since early 1993 in the March quarter this year when the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2 percent for an annual inflation rate of just 1.3 percent.</p>
<p>Economists said the figures confirmed that low inflation is entrenched in Australia and likely to stay that way for the next year or so.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation result was bang on what we expected and it was pretty neutral for the markets,&quot; said John Kyriakopoulos, chief economist at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>&quot;It confirms that currently inflation remains low and there are no inflation pressures,&quot; Kyriakopoulos said.</p>
<p>Economists said the the figures did not stand in the way of another easing in monetary policy, but most thought the central bank would keep interest rates where they are in the near term.</p>
<p>Official cash rates are currently at six percent after having been reduced three times in the second half of 1996.</p>
<p>Most economic analysts had expected the March quarter CPI to rise by 0.1 percent for an annual rate of 1.2 percent.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the key underlying inflation rose 0.4 percent in the March quarter to stand at 2.1 percent for the year -- in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;What it says is that low inflation is entrenched in Australia and is likely to stay that way for a good 12 months,&quot; said Craig James, senior economist at Colonial State Bank.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia aims to keep the underlying rate to an average of between two and three percent over a number of years.</p>
