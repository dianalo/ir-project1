<p>The Indian government has approved an investment by U.S. soft drink maker Coca Cola Company to set up bottling plants under an overall $700 million investment plan, an industry source said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the approval of the downstream ventures,&quot; said the source close to the Industry Ministry. &quot;This is part of the $700 million (overall plan).&quot;</p>
<p>The downstream investment involved the setting up of bottling plants by Coca Cola, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said that Coca Cola's plan to set up two subsidiaries was cleared by the cabinet committee on foreign investment (CCFI) at a meeting on Friday.</p>
<p>Government officials could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>&quot;Within five years 49 percent of the equity will be sold to public (under the plan),&quot; the source said. He said he could not give other details.</p>
<p>The approval was one of six foreign investment projects approved by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujaral's two-month old government, in a further demonstration of India's commitment to economic liberalisation.</p>
<p>India reopened its doors to the Atlanta-based soft drinks giant after 16 years in 1993.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola pulled out of India in 1977 after the government insisted it reveal the formula for its soft drink, a closely-guarded secret.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola's main rival, Pepsico Inc, entered India in 1990 in a joint venture to challenge home-grown cola drinks boasting names like Thums-Up and Campa Cola.</p>
<p>Analysts say the government approval would strengthen the soft drink maker's positions in its ongoing battle with bottlers.</p>
<p>Coca Cola sought to buy equity in its local bottlers, but the bottlers have resisted on grounds that the beverage giant was trying to take over their business after having asked them to invest in the plants.</p>
