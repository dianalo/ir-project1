<p>Japan`s customs-cleared trade surplus fell sharply in January, plunging 91.7 percent from a year earlier to 5.19 billion yen (41.8 million), but the drop was a seasonal one, the Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The closely watched trade surplus with the United States, often a source of trade friction, rose 81.6 percent in January from a year earlier to 298.34 billion yen (2.40 billion).</p>
<p>The growth in the surplus with the United States was mainly due to higher sales of cars, a ministry official said.</p>
<p>This jump was offset, however, by Japan`s trade with China, which was in deficit by 291.42 billion yen (2.35 billion).</p>
<p>The drop in the January overall surplus, the 26th consecutive month of year-on-year declines, was due to traditional sluggishness in productivity during the New Year holiday period, the ministry official said.</p>
<p>Seasonally adjusted, the customs-cleared trade surplus was up 25.6 percent.</p>
<p>Economists had been deeply divided in their forecasts for the figures due to seasonal factors and they said January figures are a poor guide to changes in Japan`s trade patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the seasonally adjusted figures, it`s pretty clear that the bottom was around last May, so it has been gradually trending up,&quot; said Peter Morgan, chief economist at James Capel Pacific. &quot;It`s really a question of at what point you will see a year-on-year rise, certainly by the second quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Many economists said they expect the yen`s fall since mid-1995 to boost exports while discouraging imports, eventually causing a halt in the trend of a declining surplus.</p>
<p>A weaker yen makes Japanese products cheaper in terms of foreign currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason why both imports and exports are so strong in value terms is that the value of the yen has depreciated,&quot; said Jason James, a strategist at James Capel. &quot;The underlying trend is for exports picking up more strongly now than imports. We have been seeing the seasonally adjusted surplus pick up, and I think this will definitely continue this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall exports in January grew 17.2 percent from a year earlier in yen value terms, which was the biggest growth since July 1996, when they grew 17.5 percent, the official said.</p>
<p>Exports to the United States in January rose 26.5 percent year-on-year to 1.055 trillion yen (8.5 billion). A rise in imports from the United States of 13.0 percent to 756.87 billion yen (6.10 billion) was mainly due to imports of aircraft and audiovisual equipment, he said.</p>
