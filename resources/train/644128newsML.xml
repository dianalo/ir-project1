<title>SWITZERLAND: WTO set to create panel in Indonesia car dispute.</title>

<p>The World Trade Organisation (WTO) appears set to create a dispute panel sought by the European Union and Japan on Indonesia's controversial &quot;national car&quot; policy, diplomats said on Friday.</p>
<p>Both trade powers have put their request on the agenda of a meeting of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) next Thursday for the second time, and under the trade body's rules a panel will be established automatically.</p>
<p>Indonesia blocked earlier panel bids by the two, who are strongly supported by the United States, but the rules do not allow it to repeat this action.</p>
<p>The EU and Japan argue WTO open trade regulations are violated by the policy, which gives special tax exemptions from tariffs and taxes to national carmakers.</p>
<p>The concessions have so far benefited only a joint venture between a company headed by a son of Indonesia's President Suharto and South Korea's Kia Motor Corp, which produces a sedan known as the Timor at a Kia plant.</p>
<p>The two powers, as well as the United States which is also expected to seek a panel in the coming weeks, argue the policy discriminates against their automobile exports to Indonesia by making the Timor cheaper.</p>
<p>Jakarta has rejected the complaint, insisting that it is not breaking WTO rules.</p>
<p>A panel -- made up of three neutral experts -- would have six months to come up with its findings. But these could be appealed by either side and it could be up to 18 months before a final WTO ruling is approved by the presently 131 members.</p>
<p>If the case should go against Indonesia, it could not block a final ruling -- as it would have been able to do in the WTO's predecessor body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- and would be asked to bring the policy in line with the rules.</p>
<p>If it declined, the complainant powers would be authorised to take trade measures against Indonesian exports to the value of the trade they say they have lost.</p>
