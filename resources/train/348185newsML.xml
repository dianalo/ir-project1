<headline>BankBoston seen finding new buyer for unit.</headline>
<text>
<p>NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuter) BankBoston Corp, which pulled the plug Thursday on its deal to sell a consumer finance unit to Mercury Finance Co for $458 million in Mercury stock, will probably have little trouble finding another buyer for the unit, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the time they (BankBoston) were structuring this deal there were four or five other firms that expressed interest or made bids on Fidelity (Acceptance Corp),&quot; said analyst Nancy Bush of Brown Brothers Harriman. &quot;I don't think they're going to get the kind of sweetheart deal they got with Mercury,&quot; Bush said.  </p>
<p>BankBoston acted to terminate the deal with Mercury a little more than 24 hours after Mercury announced it was restating four years of earnings results because of the discovery of accounting irregularities.</p>
<p>Mercury's stock has not traded on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday or Thursday although there were trades in Europe at $4.25 a share. Mercury had closed in the U.S. at a price of $14.875 a share Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Timing is everything,&quot; Bush observed regarding BankBoston's close call. A clause in the agreement about materially adverse developments allowed BankBoston to get out of the deal.</p>
<p>&quot;Given what seems to be an increasingly clouded picture and fingerpointing I guess the indication was 'let's get out of that and look elsewhere,'&quot; said analyst Frank Barkocky of Josepthal Lyon &amp; Ross.</p>
<p>Barkocy said BankBoston would probably go back to the Fidelity suitors it talked to before.  </p>
<p>Bush noted that BankBoston said last year that it was examining all of its national consumer busineses. Fidelity Acceptance was the largest piece. Another unit which is a candidate for sale is one specializing in the finance of recreational vehicles.</p>
<p>Barkocy had written in a research report early Thursday before the termination announcement that other than surprise and disappointment, and a delay in its strategy, the Mercury situation had no material effect on BankBoston.</p>
<p>BankBoston, whose stock had slipped 1/4 on Wednesday, rose 1-1/4 to 70-1/2 Thursday.</p>
