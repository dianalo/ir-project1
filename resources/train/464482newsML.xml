<headline>FOCUS-Most Eurostocks end down on US rate prospects.</headline>

<p>Most European bourses closed lower on Monday with investors increasingly worried that the United States would this week increase interest rates for the first time in two years.</p>
<p>But on currency markets the prospect of higher rates was good news for the dollar and the U.S. currency climbed as traders anticipated a more attractive return on dollar-denominated assets.</p>
<p>London and Paris stocks ended the day in the minus column but Frankfurt made healthy gains. Trading was edgy, against a backdrop of Tuesday's meeting of the U.S. central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which is widely expected to raise rates.</p>
<p>The uncertain mood on European markets followed volatile trading last week after hints by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about an impending rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>London's FTSE index of leading shares ended the day nearly one percent down, its lowest level for two months and the sixth consecutive trading session to register losses.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we needed some sort of correction and we are certainly getting it,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;The market has become very nervous, we may come back to 4,150 as part of this correction.&quot;</p>
<p>The index tumbled 3.8 percent last week as investors braced themselves for the upcoming British general election and the possibility of near-term interest rate rises at home and in the United States.</p>
<p>Traders do not expect to see a British rate rise until after the election in May, which the opposition Labour party is expected to win, but traders said interest rate sentiment here was also increasingly nervous.</p>
<p>&quot;UK interest rate expectations for the end of the year, measured by short sterling, have moved from 6-3/4 pct to 7-1/4 pct in the space of one week,&quot; said Steve Wright, UK equities strategist at BZW.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a big deterioration in a short space of time and part of this reflects an increased expectation of a tightening in the U.S. and part of it is a political risk premium.&quot;</p>
<p>In contrast, Frankfurt closed up 0.72 percent, shrugging aside the rates worries and taking encouragement from the stronger dollar, seen as good news for exporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is surprisingly strong... the main factor is that the market has factored in a 25-basis point hike in U.S. interest rates,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>In Paris, shares slipped in and out of profit for much of the day and ended showing a modest loss as investors focused attention on the FOMC meeting and optimism ebbed away.</p>
<p>The market was adjusting to a quarter percent pre-emptive rise in U.S. rates but investors were unwilling to commit themselves until the move is confirmed. French bonds were steady.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, Lyonnaise des Eaux rose and Suez fell as rumours of a merger between the two firms gripped the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is betting on the fact that the merger will take place and that Suez will absorb Lyonnaise des Eaux, which means Suez will have to pay a premium to encourage that merger,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>On the currency front, the dollar was stronger with analysts also predicting a 25 basis point hike at Tuesday's meeting. But it slipped in late trade as dealers became wary that a rise in U.S. rates could trigger a selloff in U.S. stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to see what the upside for the dollar will be, but I think the currency will wait for a lead from the bond and equity markets,&quot; said Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of 48 economists, after Greenspan's remarks, showed 34 expected the Fed to raise its federal funds target to at least 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts say the reason the dollar is so vulnerable to the reaction of the bond market is because of the amount of foreign investment in dollar securities, which are needed to fund the huge U.S. current account deficit. When these funds retrench from volatile U.S. asset markets, the dollar shivers.</p>
<p>Another discordant note for the dollar was struck by a senior Bundesbank official who expressed concern about the effect a U.S. rate hike would have on German rates.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke said an increase in U.S. rates could push German rates higher, adding that this &quot;cannot be desirable&quot;. He said the central bank considered the level of German rates appropriate now in view of current inflation, the economic situation, and money supply.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Welteke) comments... were slightly deutschemark-supportive, but the main backdrop is dollar-supportive based on the expectations of higher interest rates tomorrow,&quot; said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1700 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.6876 marks and 122.89 yen compared with 1.6835 marks and 122.55 yen in late European trade on Friday.</p>

<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index closed down 40.0 points at 4,214.8.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 ended down 7.85 points at 2,579.28.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index finished up 23.60 points at 3,321.84.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
