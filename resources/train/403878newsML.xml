<text>
<p>The governments of Sierra Leone and Liberia have agreed to tighten security along their common border to prevent subversive elements crossing in either direction.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the head of Liberia's interim ruling state council, Ruth Perry, said in a joint statment on Tuesday that a joint commission and mutual defence pact should be revived.</p>
<p>They made a joint call for Sierra Leone's rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, currently in Ivory Coast, to cooperate fully with the U.N. and other mediators and ensure early deployment of a peacekeeping mission under an Ivorian-mediated peace deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The two heads of state underscored the need to reactivate as soon as possible the work of the joint commission of cooperation between both countries and their mutual defence pact,&quot; the joint statement said.</p>
<p>Tejan Kabbah took office in the former British colony in March 1996 after multi-party elections ended four years of army rule. He and Sankoh, who took up arms in 1991, signed a peace deal in Ivory Coast in November but implementation has dragged.</p>
<p>Both sides denounce truce violations.</p>
<p>Liberia, set up by freed American slaves in 1847, is on course for May 30 elections to end seven years of civil war following disarmament that ended early in February.</p>
