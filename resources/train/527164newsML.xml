<headline>Dart in conditional settlement with Haft.</headline>

<text>
<p>Dart Group Corp said Tuesday it reached a conditional settlement in principle with Herbert Haft, the company's founder and its present chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>If the settlement is implemented, the company said Herbert Haft, 76, will retire from his positions as chairman of Dart and its three major operating subsidiaries: Shoppers Food Warehouse Corp, Trak Auto Corp and Crown Books Corp.  </p>
<p>Haft will relinquish his claim to voting control of Dart and sell the company all of his stock and stock options in Dart, Trak Auto and Crown Books, it said.</p>
<p>The settlement would terminate Haft's employment agreement with Dart and would resolve all outstanding litigation and disputes between them.</p>
<p>Haft would also assign certain real estate interests to the company and receive $29.7 million from Dart if the settlement is implemented, the company said.</p>
<p>Herbert Haft would also receive an additional $11.6 million from escrowed funds previously paid by Dart to Ronald Haft as part of its October 1995 settlement with him, and $700,000 in interest on those funds, the company said.</p>
<p>The agreement in principle also allows that Dart would make a $10 million loan to a partnership owned by Herbert and Ronald Haft. The loan would be secured by partnership interests in three shopping centers located in suburban Washington, D.C. and would be personally guaranteed by Ronald Haft, the company added.</p>
