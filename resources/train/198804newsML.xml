<p>A new report showing almost a million Canadian children are living in poverty has prompted calls for a child support program similar to the country's plan for senior citizens.</p>
<p>One in five Canadian children, or 800,000, live in poverty, according to a report released Monday by the organization. Statistics Canada defines any family of three with less than $25,000 in income as &quot;poor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We need a special fund to protect money from being diverted from children's programs to other national priorities,&quot; said Rosemarie Popham, coordinator of Campaign 2000, a coalition of Canadian community groups. &quot;Everyone would pay into the fund, and it would have universal benefits.&quot;</p>
<p>Popham said a &quot;small&quot; increase in personal and corporate income taxes would be required to keep the fund going. &quot;You can not address the problem of child poverty without spending money,&quot; Popham said.</p>
<p>The federal government currently spends approximately $5 billion each year on income security programs for children.</p>
<p>But the current Liberal government has slashed social spending in the last three years and shows no willingness to raise taxes to finance new programs.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Paul Martin has said that poor children would be his priority if not for the country's deficit problems.</p>
