<p>Measures to improve land liquidity to be drawn up by the government by March 31 will help financial firms dispose of bad loans, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said he was told by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Tuesday to draw up the plan.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we make effective use of land, it is true that this will have an impact on solving problem loans quickly for financial firms,&quot; Mitsuzuka said.</p>
<p>He added that it would also help to bring land prices to the level where they should be. Details of the scheme to improve land liquidity will be formally announced on March 31.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said that by securitising collateralised real estate he hoped to boost the attractiveness of securitised financial products for both issuers and investors. It should be done in a way which would be both simple and offer a variety of investments at a low cost, with due consideration for protection of investors.  </p>
<p>Asked about Japan's trade surplus, which rose in February for the first time in 27 months, Mitsuzuka said: &quot;We think the shrinking trend of the trade surplus is becoming slower. We will keep very careful watch on this.&quot;</p>
<p>He reiterated his view that Japan will likely achieve economic growth led by domestic demand by carrying out measures to correct its high-cost economic structure through deregulation.</p>
<p>He said a conference attended by Hashimoto on Tuesday would discuss measures to cut state debt. Mitsuzuka stressed the importance of achieving a cabinet-approved goal of reducing the state deficit to below three percent of gross domestic product by 2005, and bringing the date forward if possible, perhaps one or two years before the cabinet-approved deadline.</p>
