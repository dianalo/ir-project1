<title>UK: NWE gas oil off on futures, low sulphur pressured.</title>
<headline>NWE gas oil off on futures, low sulphur pressured.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gas oil eased on Wednesday in line with falling benchmark IPE gas oil futures, ample supply and slack demand, traders said.</p>
<p>June IPE gas oil was $2.0 lower at $168.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>Heating oil premiums were static at around $1.0/$1.75 fob ARA for first half June delivery. Two lots of 1,000 tonnes traded at June IPE +$1.25 fob Rotterdam earlier.</p>
<p>Traders said a few players appeared to have taken advantage of the lower futures prices to cover a few shorts.</p>
<p>Low sulphur continued under pressure with differentials for first half June delivery barges at June IPE +$7.0/+$9.0 fob ARA.</p>
<p>A refiner picked up a small low sulphur barge for $8.50, but players said the number was on the high side. Few buyers were prepared to go above +$7.0.</p>
<p>&quot;The trouble is that there is low sulphur material everywhere,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders blamed the slump in low sulphur diesel prices on the arrival of arbitraged Algerian and Italian cargoes in the north in a generally slack market.</p>
<p>&quot;German demand had been low recently,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>On cargoes, many players speculated about the intentions of a Wall Street trader.  </p>
<p>That player picked up on Tuesday three cargoes of low sulphur material at June IPE +$6.0, $6.50 and %5.25 cif NWE for first half delivery.</p>
<p>Some thought the trader had been merely taking advantage of the competitive prices while others speculated the trader was looking to work the arbitrage to the Far East.</p>
