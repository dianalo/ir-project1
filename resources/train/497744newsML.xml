<p>The Israeli shekel's representative rate was fixed slightly lower gainst the dollar and the currency basket on Wednesday after the U.S. currency rose to a 56-month high against the yen in Europe, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was very quiet today with the shekel declining slightly against the dollar as it continued to rise abroad. The sentiment for the dollar is very bullish and it seems that the shekel's weakening will continue in the near term,&quot; said a dealer at United Mizrahi Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Following the dollar's rise (against the mark and yen) the basket declined again and the central bank had to intervene in the market buying more than $100 million to support the basket,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The central bank has been intervening regularly in the market to defend the currency basket, which has been trading at the bottom end of its band for two months.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3900 shekels against 3.3890 on Tuesday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, was fixed at 3.6662 shekels against 3.6656 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the shekel traded against the yen at 2.6819 shekels per 100 yen compared with 2.6848 on Tuesday, and against the mark at 1.9758 shekels after 1.9772 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, the dollar was trading at 3.3910 shekels.</p>
