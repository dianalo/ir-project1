<headline>Copper city tries to buck trend of decay in Zaire.</headline>

<p>While Zaire decays from neglect, the new mayor in its second city Lubumbashi has ordered that the grass verges be trimmed and the kerbstones given a fresh lick of whitewash.</p>
<p>&quot;They must be sprucing it up for (rebel leader) Laurent Kabila,&quot; said one astonished visitor from the capital Kinshasa, where such behaviour is unheard of. He spoke only half in jest.</p>
<p>Locals say the clean-up is a sign of rising hope of a boom in the southern copperbelt of Shaba -- a strategic cornerstone of Zaire's economy.</p>
<p>Under President Mobutu Sese Seko and his entourage, Shaba's mineral wealth has been sucked out by the central authorities in Kinshasa where it has disappeared into an abyss of administrative chaos and corruption.</p>
<p>As mines ground to a virtual halt, Shaba grew even poorer.</p>
<p>Like Kinshasa, &quot;Lubum&quot; has a faded charm that hints at earlier better times, when the zoo still had animals, the civic museum had money for exhibits and streets were paved.</p>
<p>The city's residents say they are desperate for an end to over three decades of Mobutu rule. They know their plans -- to woo foreign investors back to the mines and expand growing trade with southern Africa -- are on hold until the war is over.</p>
<p>&quot;The truth is, all the people here are waiting eagerly for Mr Kabila. They see him as a saviour,&quot; said Shaba's reappointed and fiercely pro-autonomy governor, Kyungu wa Kumwanza.</p>
<p>The central government suspended Kyungu for alleged secession moves two years ago.</p>
<p>A half-erased &quot;We want Kabila&quot; slogan adorns the corner of the high wall surrounding the governor's official villa.</p>
<p>The rebels control northern parts of Shaba. People on the potholed city streets say it is only a matter of days or weeks before they, or their local sympathisers, take over.</p>
<p>For now, the low-rise city known in Belgian colonial days as Elisabethville is calm but uneasy, hoping for a swift transition with a minimum of looting by retreating soldiers.</p>
<p>Trading communities such as the Greeks and Lebanese, and local Belgian workers have sent families away until the storm passes. Groups of bored males stay behind in their &quot;expat&quot; bars -- the Centaure, the Relais, the Cercle Wallon.</p>
<p>Despite Zaire's five-month war, optimism has returned along with foreign investors in the copper, cobalt and zinc mines.</p>
<p>A foreign venture has got the railway working again, shops are stocked with South African goods and beer consumption has doubled in a matter of months, a sign of consumer confidence.</p>
<p>The scars from previous bouts of pillaging during periodic political unrest in the early 1990s are still visible, from the boarded-up former nightclubs to the empty shells of shops amid modest art deco buildings like the ochre post office.</p>
<p>The abandoned U.S. consulate, one of scores of plush garden villas in what was once a colonial boom town beside its mine, has become the office of a local success story, Telecel.</p>
<p>The private cellular telephone network provider has thrived in a country whose existing phone system has collapsed like its railways, roads, hospitals and schools.</p>
<p>Missionaries of all persuasions have for a long time stood in to fill many of the gaps left by the state. Priests and nuns cycle round the town, a curious sight in times of tension.</p>
<p>On Easter Sunday, dozens of rival churches -- the Byzantine-style red brick Roman Catholic cathedral foremost -- wooed Lubumbashi's townsfolk to services to pray for peace.</p>
