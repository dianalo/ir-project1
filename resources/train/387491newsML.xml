<p>Arbitration proceedings were being pursued by the Nigerian liquefied natural gas (NLNG) company over the cancellation of a contract by Italian state power firm Enel to buy its gas, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to correct the impression held since last week, especially in Italy, that the problem has been solved,&quot; said NLNG's Dutch managing director, Theo Oerlemans.</p>
<p>Oerlemans said it was a &quot;total overstatement&quot; that alternative arrangements were being made by Enel for all or part of the LNG originally contracted be delivered to Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;As of today, NLNG has not received any proposal from Enel that could be properly considered. If there is a proposal, we will certainly consider it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The NLNG will continue to pursue their claims in arbitration for full compensation and substantial damages.&quot;</p>
<p>Arbitration between the two parties started soon after Enel in December pulled out of the contract to buy 3.5 billion cubic metres of gas per year. NLNG officials have said they were not looking for alternative buyers.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Stefano Dejak, Italian embassy counsellor in Lagos, said new discussions had begun between Nigeria and Italy on the issue.</p>
<p>Dejak said the Italian government was willing to assist Enel reach an agreement over the Nigerian LNG-Enel contract, adding that the matter would be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Oerlemans said: &quot;I think the Italians want to overplay the situation to their favour.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week, Nigerian Oil Minister Dan Etete said there were contacts between the two parties aimed at reaching an amicable out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;The federal government has been receiving encouraging response from the Italian government,&quot; Etete told reporters in southeastern Bonny town, the construction site of the project.</p>
<p>Work has continued on the $4 billion LNG project which is to produce 7.2 billion cubic metres of gas per year from 1999.</p>
<p>Shell Gas BV is the technical leader with 25.6 percent of the equity in the NLNG joint venture with state oil firm Nigerian National Petroleum Corp which has 49 percent.</p>
<p>The other partners are Elf Aquitaine with 15 percent and Italy's Agip with 10.4 percent.</p>
<p>Long-term supply contracts have been signed with Enagas of Spain, Gaz de France and Botas of Turkey.</p>
