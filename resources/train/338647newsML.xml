<p>Britain's trade deficit widened in December and November as growth in Europe slowed and the strong pound made it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad, official figures showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the global trade deficit mushroomed to 959 million pounds ($1.55 billion) in November from 680 million in October.</p>
<p>More recent figures for trade with countries outside the European Union showed a deficit in December of 844 million pounds, up from a 699 million shortfall in November.</p>
<p>&quot;This was largely because of a decline in exports, possibly related to sterling strength, but more likely to the slowdown in Europe at year end,&quot; said Andrew Milligan, an economist at General Accident.</p>
<p>Total exports of goods fell to 13.88 billion pounds in November from 14.41 billion the previous month, while imports eased to 14.84 billion from 15.09 billion.</p>
<p>Economists said Britain's trade position was likely to deteriorate further in 1997 as greater demand for cheaper imports from increasingly confident consumers inflated the import side of the balance sheet.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially the fact you've got lower prices for imports means you can have more of them without affecting the overall balance,&quot; said Lehman Brothers economist Mike Dicks.</p>
<p>&quot;But by the second quarter, volume trends should dominate so we will see a deterioration.&quot;</p>
<p>The pound has soared in value against the currencies of Britain's major trading partners over the last six months, making British exports more expensive but imports cheaper.</p>
<p>The good news on Tuesday was that prices of imports fell three percent in November from October, a fact the government was quick to single out as good news for domestic inflation.</p>
<p>But the opposition Labour Party said the trade figures were disappointing. &quot;They show once again that the Conservatives' general claims for the economy are grossly over-optimistic,&quot; Labour's trade spokeswoman Margaret Beckett said.</p>
<p>HSBC economist Dharshini David agreed the fall in import prices should lead to lower prices in the shops eventually.</p>
<p>&quot;The beneficial effects of a stronger currency are still very much in evidence. This implies producer price inflation should remain subdued in coming months, which is good news for the retail price index further down the pipeline,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Dicks said that while cheap imports may show up in lower goods inflation, service sector prices will remain largely immune.</p>
<p>&quot;Some good news will come through on the goods component of the retail price index but the services sector is pretty much protected. In a sense we have a dual economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Economists said the expected worsening of Britain's balance of payments will do little to dent the rosy outlook for economic growth in 1997, which will be driven largely by domestic demand.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact on overall growth will be marginal,&quot; said Dicks. &quot;The key there will be consumers' willingness to spend in a year when they've got a lot of windfall gains.&quot;</p>
<p>A number of leading mutually-owned home loans institutions plan to convert to banks in 1997, giving free shares worth hundreds or thousands of pounds to millions of account holders.</p>
<p>&quot;To some extent this will suck in imports, which will detract from overall gross domestic product growth, but I can't imagine it's going to dampen it down much,&quot; Dicks added. ($1=.6199 Pound)</p>
