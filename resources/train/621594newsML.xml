<p>Italian economy growth is expected to have idled in the first three months of 1997 before sputtering more convincingly back to life in the second quarter, economists said.</p>
<p>First quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data due on Friday are likely to show the economy grew 0.1 percent from the previous quarter but was almost flat at 0.04 percent year on year, according to forecasts from 10 economists polled by Reuters.</p>
<p>GDP growth was 0.1 percent quarter on quarter in the final three months of 1996 and fell 0.2 percent year on year, while in the first quarter of 1996 it grew 0.5 percent on a quarterly basis and 1.5 percent taking the annual comparison.</p>
<p>Recovery in production was expected to have helped GDP growth in this year's first quarter but would be counterbalanced by the fewer number of working days, analysts said.</p>
<p>Paolo Casadio, economist at Credito Italiano, said the number of working days had fallen progressively in the last few quarters but the three months to March should mark the end of that and the days would be recovered in the coming six months.</p>
<p>&quot;This gives the appearance of a worsening in the economy and step by step as we proceed through the year there will be the opposite effect with the appearance of improvement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Angela Ancona at Banca Commerciale Italiana said: &quot;Signals of recovery in industrial production help to improve the picture even though there are fewer working days -- a fact which will prevent these signals from showing up more strongly in GDP.&quot;</p>
<p>Seasonally adjusted industrial output rose 2.3 percent month on month in February and 0.7 percent in March. Compared with the 1996 fourth quarter output rose 1.4 percent.</p>
<p>Other positive factors included &quot;the recovery even if it's only moderate, in consumption and the trade surplus,&quot; said Martino Dolfini at Chase, noting imports had fallen much more than exports.</p>
<p>Cariplo researchers said net exports should form the most consistent part of revenue growth, while a tendency to destock was likely to continue in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Other economists said stocks had started to rise only in March so this was not likely to be seen in first quarter GDP figures but would start to be felt in industrial output data.</p>
<p>Bank of America economists were more pessimistic on the outlook for GDP, expecting a quarterly fall of 0.2 percent and a year on year decrease of 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is weak and should recover modestly only in the second quarter,&quot; a Bank of America research note said.</p>
<p>&quot;Data indicate an economy which is stagnant if not technically in modest recession, even if recent indicators show a modest recovery in the second half of the year,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>National statistics institute Istat will release first quarter GDP data on Friday May 30. Following are analysts' forecasts:</p>
