<p>Air cargo rates from Paris are showing modest increases on key Far East routes as the market enters the early Spring peak period, a Reuters survey showed.</p>
<p>Ex-Paris pacesetter, Air France, announced it would be increasing its rates by between three and eight percent on selected routes from March 1 to Asia, excluding Japan and also South America, North America, French-speaking Africa.</p>
<p>However, the airline declined to provide details on increases on specific destinations.</p>
<p>The star-performing cargo route from Paris at present is undoubtedly Singapore.</p>
<p>The joint SIA /Air France 747-200F service between Paris and Singapore is to undergo a significant upgrade later this month with weekly frequencies increasing from three to five.</p>
<p>&quot;The upgrade, more important than intially planned, is due to the buoyant level of outbound and inbound traffic and strong demand forecasts for 1997,&quot; said David Lim, SIA's London-based regional cargo manager, Europe.</p>
<p>The Paris-Singapore route will also be the subject of rates increases from April 1 with SIA indicating that this will work at around five percent.</p>
<p>From June 1 1997, SIA plans to replace its two 747-200Fs plying the route with 400F &quot;Mega Arks&quot; which offer ten to 20 tonnes extra capacity per flight as a result of an extra main deck position.</p>
<p>The upgrade has certainly raised eyebrows among other Far East carriers.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly, it's a daring exercise to put on such a significant amount of supplementary capacity when one considers that rates on the route are hardly within the &quot;prime&quot; band. Maybe they know something we don't!&quot;</p>
<p>Currently Paris-Singapore rates vary between 8.50 francs/kilo and 9.00fr/kilo which represents just under half the level top rates on Paris-Japan routes.</p>
<p>Two other Far East carriers, Thai Airways, which operates some of its freighter services jointly with Air France from CDG and Malaysian Airline System, which lost its main deck capacity from Paris recently following the withdrawal of 747 combis, increased ex-Paris rates by around five percent from March 1 while Korean Airlines is to up its rates by between seven and five percent from April 1.</p>
<p>No one at Cathay Pacific's CDG cargo station was available to comment on whether the airline would be upping its Paris rates in the Spring following a five percent hike in December 1996 to Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul.</p>
<p>Japan Airlines, which along with All Nippon Airways, increased ex-Paris rates by three to four percent from January 1, said it had no immediate plans to up tarifs for a second time in 1997 nor to increase capacity on its freighter services from Charles de Gaulle airport.</p>
<p>JAL and Air France jointly operate a four-times weekly Boeing 747F service between Paris and Tokyo.</p>
<p>The Japanese carrier also has a block-space agreement on Air France's weekly 747F service between Paris and Osaka.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has picked up markedly since the beginning of March. However, at the moment, bookings can be made only one to two days in advance so there's no real squeeze on capacity unlike the equivalent period two years ago when customers had to wait one week to ten days to secure space, &quot;the official added.</p>
<p>Air France also confirmed that its freighter programme to Japan, which also includes a service run idependently of JAL, would not be changing with the introduction of summer schedules at the end of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;For some time, the Far East has been the region where most of the growth in activity has taken place and one where new potential is emerging, notably, in China. While North America remains the major airfreight market from Paris but it has become a fairly stagnant one with development being concentrated further south in Latin America,&quot; one CDG-based forwarder said commenting on the overall market..</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rates on one of the major Middle East routes from Paris, Dubai, showed increases of between 20 and 50 centimes on an average rate of 5.25 to 5.50 francs a kilo.</p>
<p>National carrier, Emirates, increased its tarifs by between five and ten percent to Dubai and onward destinations, effective March 1. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017</p>
