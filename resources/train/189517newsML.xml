<title>GREECE: Greek exchange battered by settlement scandal.</title>

<p>The Athens stock exchange, rocked to its foundations over the past week, fell sharply Thursday in the first normal session since a trading scandal shut down most operations for four days.</p>
<p>Brokers said the repercussions from the Delta Securities scandal would be far-reaching and would cast a shadow over the exchange for some time.</p>
<p>Stocks closed down 3.31 percent or 30.04 points at 878.38 after opening at 908.07. There was a steady across-the-board selling.</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment is not good. Retail and institutional investors were selling,&quot; a floor trader said.</p>
<p>The crisis erupted when Delta, a relatively small brokerage, tried to settle its account at the exchange's clearing house with 2.6 billion Greek drachmas ($11 million) in bad checks.</p>
<p>The 65-member Association of Athens Stock Exchange Members, angered by perceived inaction by authorities to probe the scandal, refused to trade and effectively closed the exchange for four days.</p>
<p>The brokers' revolt appears to have put pressure on exchange officials to watch transactions more closely. Authorities have ordered a two-day suspension of trade in four stocks linked to the Delta scandal.</p>
<p>The national economy ministry has ordered an audit of 10 brokerages and many brokers have said they would like to know which firms were on the opposite side of the Delta trades.</p>
<p>Some brokers said the scandal had brought to the fore a battle for survival among the increasing number of brokerages in Athens' small market.</p>
<p>&quot;When commissions were liberalised it became obvious that the Athens stock exchange could no longer provide enough income for 65 brokers,&quot; ING Barings said in a recent report.</p>
<p>The scandal also highlighted notorious short-selling, which has cried out for regulation. But authorities have proved slow to move and apparently happy to turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>Short-selling developed into a way to boost trading volume in a thin market, make fast money on the downside and even to break even on previous losses, brokers said.</p>
<p>Although no one has said so officially, many brokers suspect short-selling was part of the Delta scandal. Three senior Delta officials have been charged with fraud and the firm's accounts and assets have been frozen.</p>
<p>Part of the Delta scandal appears to be linked to brokers taking advantage of an overburdened settlement system that can take up to 40 days to clear instead of the regulated 72 hours.</p>
<p>That means unscrupulous brokers can sell shares short and capitalise on the prolonged time interval before having to actually deliver the securities, brokers said.</p>
