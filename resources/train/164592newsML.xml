<title>ISRAEL: Israel ministry plans new West Bank settlement.</title>
<headline>Israel ministry plans new West Bank settlement.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1996-11-04</dateline>

<p>Israel's Housing Ministry is planning a new settlement for ultra-Orthodox Jews in the West Bank, a ministry spokeswoman said on Monday.</p>
<p>The planning is going on despite the government having yet to decide to approve the building of a new settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;It is correct that a new settlement is being planned for Nachliel,&quot; a ministry spokeswoman said when asked to confirm media reports.</p>
<p>She said the plans called for state-funded construction of some 2,000 new housing units near Palestinian-ruled Ramallah in the West Bank, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;This is only at the very early planning stages and will have to pass through many offices before...approval,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>An aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's right-wing government, which overturned a four-year freeze on building settlements in occupied Arab territories after taking power in June, had not ruled out building new settlements.</p>
<p>&quot;It has not decided either for or against new settlements but it has established the right of Jews to live in Judea and Samaria,&quot; Netanyahu's communications director David Bar-Illan told Reuters, using biblical names for the West Bank.</p>
<p>The building of a new settlement in the occupied lands must be approved by the government. Approval of expansion of existing settlements rests with Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision of the two ministers is not a government decision. It is an announcement of intent. It is not even a government proposal yet,&quot; Bar-Illan added. Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon backs the housing ministry plans.</p>
<p>Some 130,000 Jews have settled amongst the nearly two million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians view the settlers as a provocation and vehemently oppose any expansion of Jewish settlements in territories where they hope to build an independent state.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's settlement policy has thus far been limited to expansion of existing settlements. Jewish settlers have said they are in fact upset at Netanyahu for what they call the &quot;continued freeze&quot; of settlement construction.</p>
<p>&quot;On Wednesday we will launch a three-day protest outside the prime minister's office,&quot; a spokeswoman for the Yesha Council, the settlers' umbrella group, told Reuters.</p>
