<p>Lack of export demand for Indian non-Basmati rice pulled prices down by $5-10 per tonne during the past week, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;No new (rice export) contracts were signed during last week,&quot; said Prem Garg, managing director of Sri Lal Mahal Overseas Ltd, a leading Delhi foodgrains exporter.</p>
<p>&quot;Some shipments of old contracts (to the Middle East and Russia) were currently moving,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said Indian five percent broken non-Basmati rice was quoted at $290 per tonne FOB, 10 percent at $280, 15 percent at $245 and 25 percent at $230.</p>
<p>&quot;There is hardly any activity in the rice market as Indian prices were ruling higher than Pakistan,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;But there are some inquiries for the 25 percent broken variety.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders reported robust demand for Basmati rice from the Middle East due to Ramadan.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for Basmati rice is good from the Middle East because of Ramadan,&quot; Garg said.</p>
<p>Traders said Indian parboiled Basmati was currently priced at around $780 to $800 per tonne FOB compared with $620 at the same time last year.</p>
<p>Raw Basmati was quoted at around $900 to $1,000 per tonne against $725 to $775 a year ago.</p>
