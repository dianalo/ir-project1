<p>NYMEX crude futures failed to break resistance early Wednesday then turned lower and broke through support, traders said.</p>
<p>The initial early bullish move came after the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that crude stocks fell last week. Further support came from below-expectations loading levels for November North Sea crude.</p>
<p>However, &quot;the market just didn't have enough ammunition to push it higher today. When it could get through $25.70 it turned and broke through $25.35 (support),&quot; said Tom Blakeslee of Cargill Investor Services. Tuesday's close was $25.42.  </p>
<p>Blakeslee says he's targeting $24.80 as next support, which represents 61.8 pct Fibonacci retracement level. Nov crude was down as low as $24.90 by 1130 EDT/1530 GMT, having been as high as $25.70, equal to the post-Gulf War high set lat April (which was briefly broken in ACCESS trading Monday night).</p>
<p>But despite the turnaround in the market Wednesday, traders and analysts still see the market as staying bullish.</p>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute reported after markets closed Tuesday that crude stocks fell last week by 417,000 barrels to just below 302 million barrels. Ahead of the winter, the closely-watched heating oil stocks rose overall but were down in PADD I, the key northeastern market.</p>
<p>&quot;The 673,000 bbls increase in distillate stocks (heating oil, diesel and jet) was within the range of expectations but there were some other eye-catching figures to give the data a stronger bullish spin,&quot; according to Tim Evans at Pegasus Econometric Group.</p>
<p>&quot;Implied demand was heavy and may indicate renewed export activity...Furthermore, we think the market was braced for worse because of what happened last week and could see some buying today,&quot; Evans says in his daily report.</p>
<p>Heating oil November futures hit a high of 74.40 cents a gallon but sunk to a low of 71.35 on the reversal, before settling back up to 71.80 by just before midday.</p>
<p>Similarly, gasoline moved up to a high of 67.60 cents a gallon following crude, then slid to 65.25 before bouncing to 65.50.</p>
