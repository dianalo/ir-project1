<p>Shareholders of Chateau Properties Inc. Tuesday approved the company's hard-fought, $365 million merger with ROC Communities Inc., creating the nation's largest mobile home park operator.</p>
<p>Shareholders of the Clinton Township, Mich.-based real estate investment trust approved the deal by an 85 percent margin at a special meeting here.</p>
<p>The vote marks the end of a seven-month saga that brought two competing bids and several shareholder lawsuits and focused investor attention on the growth of the mobile home industry.</p>
<p>After the deal between Chateau and Englewood, Colo.-based ROC was announced last July, Manufactured Home Communities, controlled by billionaire Chicago investor Sam Zell, launched a $26-a-share tender offer for Chateau.</p>
<p>At the time, Zell's offer represented about a $1-a-share premium over the value of the ROC deal to Chateau shareholders, but Chateau management urged shareholders to ignore it. Chateau also rejected a competing bid by Farmington Hills, Mich.-based Sun Communities Inc.</p>
<p>Chateau shares rose 37.5 cents to $26.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. ROC shareholders approved the merger on Jan. 28, and the deal was scheduled to close Tuesday.</p>
<p>Under the restructured deal, Chateau will issue 13.1 million new shares that will be exchanged for ROC shares and 984,423 new shares to holders of Chateau's operating partnership units, both at a price of $25.875.</p>
<p>The combined company, which will change its name to Chateau Communities Inc. and be based in Englewood, will own or manage 43,000 manufactured home sites in 160 developments in 27 states.</p>
<p>&quot;Our challenge now is to prove to shareholders that this was the best deal for them,&quot; Chateau Chairman John Boll said after the meeting.</p>
<p>Boll and Chateau President C.G. Kellogg said they asked shareholders to forego a quick buyout in favour of a longer-term growth strategy focused on new development.</p>
<p>Chateau had stopped developing new properties when it went public in 1993 because of the pressure that development costs put on reported earnings and funds from operations.</p>
<p>Instead, it chose to buy existing properties and manage them, but bidding competition between Chateau, ROC, MHC and Sun and others has driven up prices for existing communities.</p>
<p>The merger with ROC will give the companies enough critical mass to resume development, Kellogg said. He said the companies will raise development spending to $20 million annually, which can be sustained without damaging earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;When we get done with a (development) project, it has a ton more value than if we purchased it,&quot; Kellogg said. &quot;We're asking shareholders to be patient.&quot;</p>
