<p>Britain, Ireland and the United States closed ranks against the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, on Thursday after a suspected IRA sniper killed a soldier and rekindled fears of fresh sectarian war in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister John Major vowed not give in to the &quot;murderous efforts&quot; of the Irish Republican Army to force his government to invite Sinn Fein to peace talks from which the party is excluded because of IRA violence.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was outraged and grieved by the callous killing of the soldier.</p>
<p>&quot;All those who care about the future of Northern Ireland must join me in condemning this cowardly crime,&quot; Clinton said, urging Northern Ireland's people to &quot;take the path of peace and reconciliation, not hatred and violence.&quot;</p>
<p>Stephen Restorick, the second soldier killed since the IRA scrapped its 17-month ceasefire 12 months ago, was shot by a single sniper's bullet as he checked a car in South Armagh, so-called &quot;bandit country&quot; near the Irish border.</p>
<p>The Irish republic, Major's partner in the search for a settlement to the 28-year Northern Ireland conflict, condemned the IRA for continuing to wage war to force an end to British rule.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Bruton told parliament the shooting of the British soldier was &quot;an expression of something we wish to eradicate from our society -- the use of violence to achieve political ends.&quot;</p>
<p>But Mitchell McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein, told Irish radio that Major's refusal to admit the party to peace talks until the IRA ended its war was the reason the soldier died.</p>
<p>&quot;John Major has responsibility for collapse of the peace process,&quot; he said. &quot;I think if it (the killing) focuses people's attention on the tragic consequences of political failure then that soldier's young life will not have been in vain.&quot;</p>
<p>Northern Irish police said later they had defused an anti-personnel bomb left in the middle of a housing estate in the Armagh area where the soldier was shot .</p>
<p>The device contained a quantity of Semtex explosive as well as nuts and bolts. Rifles and pistols also were found.</p>
<p>Major, staring defeat in the face at elections he must hold by May, vowed there would be no change to Britain's policy of refusing contact with Sinn Fein or inviting it to talks until the IRA called a permanent halt to its war.</p>
<p>Pro-British politicians believe the IRA campaign is aimed at provoking revenge attacks by their pro-British Loyalist foes to make Northern Ireland ungovernable.</p>
<p>They fear the IRA is hoping to create mayhem so that whichever government takes over after the British election is forced to invite Sinn Fein to negotiations without conditions.</p>
