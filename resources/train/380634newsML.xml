<p>U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata expressed &quot;grave fears&quot; on Saturday that Zairean rebels would attack a sprawling camp in eastern Zaire that hosts 150,000 refugees.</p>
<p>Ogata said her fears followed confirmation the Zairean army was recruiting Rwandan Hutu refugees to fight in its civil war and was using the airstrip at Tingi Tingi to fly in weapons.</p>
<p>&quot;It is extremely worrying that the same airstrip which is used to bring in humanitarian assistance is also used as an airstrip that brings in ammunition,&quot; Ogata told a news conference in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>&quot;When it becomes an area of militarised activities, the camp could easily become a target of military attack -- this is my grave concern,&quot; Ogata added.</p>
<p>A senior UNHCR official travelling with Ogata said her mission saw a shuttle of Zairean army-chartered cargo planes landing at Tingi Tingi with military equipment. The official, who declined to be named, added refugees unloaded the hardware.</p>
<p>Ogata, who spoke at the end of a tour of six &quot;Great Lakes region&quot; nations of Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, said she hoped it would be possible to divert military activity from Tingi Tingi.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very difficult situation separating the military elements from the camps especially when it is used for military and operational backup,&quot; Ogata said. &quot;I think we will have to appeal to governments to stop this from happening.&quot;</p>
<p>The new U.N. special envoy for Central Africa, Mohammed Sahnoun of Algeria, arrived in Zaire on Saturday with a message of concern about the arming of Rwandan Hutu hardliners among refugees in Zaires civil war zone.</p>
<p>Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan focused on Rwandan Hutu civilians in the war zone in a statement saying Hutu hardliners were being armed to help block a Tutsi-led rebel advance from the east.</p>
<p>U.N. officials in New York said Sahnoun would convey Annans concerns to the Kinshasa government.</p>
<p>But a senior Kinshasa defence ministry official told Reuters Zaire was not arming the Hutus, who have been blamed for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of up to 800,000 minority Tutsis.</p>
<p>Up to 150,000 refugees occupy makeshift camps around the village of Tingi Tingi, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of Zaires third city of Kisangani, headquarters for army operations against the rebels.</p>
<p>Medical workers say up to 30 people a day are dying in Tingi Tingi from hunger or disease. The Zairean official said there were no reports of fighting from the area on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ogata said she had discussed with the Zairean government a proposal offering refugees safe passage.</p>
<p>&quot;I have made my appeal that the camps not be attacked. On the (rebel) alliance side, Mr (Laurent) Kabila responded to my appeal and said he would not attack Tingi Tingi,&quot; Ogata said.</p>
<p>&quot;But seeing the considerable militarisation of Tingi Tingi, this may not necessarily be the case,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila had said he ordered his forces to avoid the Tingi Tingi camp but diplomats in New York said the military build-up there could alter that plan.</p>
