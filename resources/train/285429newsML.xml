<p>U.S. Treasuries rose, then gave back most gains in moderate volume on Friday amid fresh speculation the Fed may soon raise official interest rates.</p>
<p>Speculation about the Fed's next move, sparked by a magazine article, dampened earlier attempts to retrace some of the ground lost over the past two trading sessions.</p>
<p>Fears of a near-term Fed tightening followed strong manufacturing, construction and consumer confidence data this week. But traders said it uncertainty, more than monetary policy guesswork, accounted for a lifeless market.  </p>
<p>The market rallied a half-point in the morning amid talk the Japanese would be heavy buyers of Treasuries on Monday when they return from their New Year's holiday. But the rally faltered on fresh speculation the Fed may hike rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The market obviously had two straight days of steep decline. A lot of people recognize the market is vulnerable,&quot; said senior economist Astrid Adolfson at MCM MoneyWatch. &quot;You can no longer hide your head in the sand and not admit the U.S. economy is coming in very strong.&quot; Adolfson also cited uncertainty about U.S. economic data next week and whether Japanese investors actually would buy Treasuries.</p>
