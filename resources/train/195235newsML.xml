<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Monday Australian defence forces had been asked to prepare for an emergency after the possible impact of a stricken Russian space probe which could hit Australia later in the day.  </p>
<p>Howard told reporters Russian authorities had advised Canberra that four lethal plutonium canisters on board were designed to withstand the heat of re-entry and impact on the ground. &quot;In which case, there would be no danger of contamination,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I chaired a meeting of the national security council this morning which has asked the Australian defence force ... to make preparations to deal with any emergency.&quot;</p>
<p>The probe contains reinforced canisters containing 200 grammes of plutonium that pose a lethal threat if they crack open. Howard said the United States had offered assistance in dealing with the canisters if they were to split open.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Mike McCurry earlier issued a statement saying the U.S. &quot;believes the size of the probe is large enough to give pieces of it a chance of surviving re-entry, though most of the space craft will burn up in the atmosphere&quot;.</p>
