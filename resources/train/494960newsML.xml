<title>NETHERLANDS: Castro to be invited to EU/Latam summit.</title>

<p>Cuban leader Fidel Castro will be invited to attend a first European Union/Latin America summit scheduled to take place in either Panama or Brazil in the next 18 months, EU officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am glad to say that a summit will take place although we do not yet have a final date or venue,&quot; said one diplomat attending a meeting of EU and Latin America foreign ministers at this Dutch seaside town.</p>
<p>Asked if Castro -- increasingly being isolated by Western governments who have lost patience with his unwillingness to accept democratic reform in Cuba -- would be invited, the diplomat said: &quot;At this stage, yes. We all want him to come.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials from Europe and Latin America were on Tuesday comparing calendars to see when a summit could take place.</p>
<p>The EU has ruled out any time during the current Dutch and forthcoming Luxembourg and British presidencies as the 15-nation bloc is likely to be too occupied by economic and monetary union matters.</p>
<p>Officials said the task of co-organising the summit is likely to fall to Portugal, which takes charge for six months in the second half of 1998.</p>
<p>Although the EU does not have political links with Latin America as a whole, the summit will be arranged by combining the San Jose and Rio groups -- the two organisations with which the Europeans do have links -- and any countries not in either.</p>
<p>Castro's invitation is likely to irritate the United States which has made no secret of its desire to see Havana isolated by the international community.</p>
<p>EU and Latin American nations, however, favour dialogue with Castro as a means of prising Cuba out of the communist shell it has occupied since 1959.</p>
