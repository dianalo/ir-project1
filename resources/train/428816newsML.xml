<headline>India to discuss all issues with Pakistan - Gujral.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-03-08</dateline>

<p>Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said on Saturday talks with Pakistan this month would address all issues of mutual concern, adding that the freezing of trade between the two neighbours had been futile.</p>
<p>&quot;The Indo-Pakistan dialogue, which will resume later this month, is expected to address all issues of mutual concern,&quot; Gujral said in a speech prepared for delivery to a business conference in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Pakistan announced on Thursday that foreign ministry secretaries of the two governments would meet in New Delhi on March 28-31. Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said he hoped to see a positive outcome.</p>
<p>Gujral said India was committed to a relationship of trust, friendship and cooperation with Pakistan.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that there is a growing perception on both sides of the India-Pakistan border that the freezing of our bilateral trade and economic relationship over the past decades has achieved nothing better than mere waste and futility,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The last round of talks between the South Asian neighbours in January 1994 broke down over Kashmir, divided between India, which controls two thirds of the Himalayan region, and Pakistan, with the rest.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir, since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
<p>New Delhi considers all of Kashmir as a part of  India. Islamabad, which denies New Delhi's charges of training and arming separatist rebels, wants the Kashmiris to be allowed to vote in a U.N.-mandated plebiscite on whether to join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu-majority India.</p>
<p>No agenda has been announced for the March meeting, which is to be followed in early April by a meeting of the two countries' foreign ministers.</p>
<p>Pakistan has insisted in the past that Kashmir was the &quot;core issue&quot; and must be on the agenda of any India-Pakistan dialogue. But India has said progress over Kashmir should not be a pre-condition for discussing other issues.</p>
