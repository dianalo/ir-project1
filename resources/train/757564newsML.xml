<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton is up to his neck in hot water and enjoying every minute of it, now that a new hot tub has been donated to the White House.</p>
<p>A California firm provided a tub which can hold up to seven people to the National Parks Service, which installed it at the White House by the swimming pool near the West Wing.</p>
<p>&quot;The president reports that it's nice,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Asked why Clinton opted for a seven-seater when there are only three members of his immediate family, McCurry said it was chosen to deal with the needs of &quot;future presidents&quot; -- adding that Vice President Al Gore and his wife have four children.</p>
