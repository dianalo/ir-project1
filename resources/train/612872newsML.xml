<headline>Burma opposition braces for key party gathering.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-05-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Burma's opposition, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, said on Sunday it would go ahead with a party meeting this week despite the detention of 192 members by the ruling military.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all waiting to see what happens tonight and tomorrow to see if the authorities will stop the planned party meeting in Aung San Suu Kyi's (house) compound,&quot; a senior leader of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;So far there have been no new detentions that we heard of in addition to the 192 we know of,&quot; he said in Rangoon.</p>
<p>The party gathering set for May 27-28 is planned to coincide with the seventh anniversary of the NLD's landslide 1990 election victory which the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) never recognised.</p>
<p>The NLD has had few opportunities to gather in a large group since it won the 1990 election as the military has thwarted previous attempts.</p>
<p>The SLORC has denied that it detained any NLD members and labelled the party's claim a fabrication. It has also asked the NLD to prove the detentions.</p>
<p>A government spokesman said last week, however, that some NLD members had been requested by local authorities to refrain from acting in such a way as to create chaos in the country.</p>
<p>The NLD claimed that those detained were either restricted to their homes or confined at specific places.</p>
<p>Despite the detentions, other senior NLD members who managed to reach the party headquarters in Rangoon had discussed its political, economic, legal and justice reports as planned ahead of a general meeting set for May 27-28, the senior NLD official said.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi was not available for comment.</p>
<p>The NLD official said that security around Suu Kyi's lakeside residence at University Avenue was tight but some party members were able to visit her after stringent checks.</p>
<p>&quot;So far they have not detained any Rangoon township NLD members but we don't know if this is a sign that they may allow the party congress to go on,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>NLD officials said that even if the planned meeting was stopped by the authorities on Tuesday, senior party members who had not been detained by the authorities had met in the capital late last week had already agreed on various strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;We predicted this situation a bit earlier and therefore managed to hold discussions in advance on some papers intended to be read at the formal (May 27) meeting,&quot; said a Rangoon division NLD member of parliament.</p>
<p>The United States, Japan and some European nations have condemned the latest detentions and called on the SLORC to immediately and unconditionally free those NLD members held.</p>
<p>Last year, 261 party members, mostly MPs, were arrested ahead of a similar gathering. But the meeting took place anyway and Suu Kyi announced the NLD planned to continue its efforts to bring democracy to Burma despite the crackdowns.</p>
<p>Although the SLORC released most of the NLD members it arrested last May, some were charged and given long jail terms. Others, mainly MPs, were forced to sign papers saying they would resign from the party.</p>
