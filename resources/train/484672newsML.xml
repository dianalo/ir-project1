<text>
<p>Randalls Food Markets Inc and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co said on Thursday a KKR affiliate agreed to acquire a majority interest in the grocery store chain for a $225 million equity investment.</p>
<p>The equity investment will enable Randalls to cut its indebtedness and provide more financial flexibility, the companies said in a joint statement.  </p>
<p>KKR's equity investment also will facilitate further growth of the Randalls franchise in its markets, through both remodeling of existing stores and the addition of new stores.</p>
<p>Company founder and chairman Robert Onstead Sr. and president and chief executive R. Randall Onstead Jr. will maintain an interest in the company and will remain as executives and directors of the company, said Randalls and KKR, an investment firm.</p>
<p>Other existing Randalls shareholders, including other members of current management and employees, also will continue to own a minority stake in the company, the companies said.</p>
<p>Closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in June, is subject to customary closing conditions, the companies said.</p>
<p>Randalls Food reported revenues of approximately $2.4 billion at its 54 Randalls stores in the Houston area, 16 in Austin, and 51 Tom Thumb stores in Dallas/Fort Worth, the companies said.</p>
