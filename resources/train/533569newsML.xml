<p>The Australian dollar shrugged off early tremors to edge higher Wednesday as consumer price data confirmed inflation pressures were waning but not so far as to trigger another cut in official rates.</p>
<p>It had come under pressure as the money market began to believe loose talk the data would be very weak indeed and chased yields lower across the curve. It was disappointed therefore when annual underlying inflation remained steady at 2.1 percent and the dollar enjoyed a short covering bounce in response.</p>
<p>Signs of Japanese bids, perhaps for samurais, also offered support, although it still balked at US$0.7795 resistance.  </p>
<p>By 4.30 pm (0630 GMT), the dollar had stepped up to US$0.7777/82 having slid as far as US$0.7745/50 just before the data hit dealing screens from an early US$0.7770/75.</p>
<p>The currency was also ahead of Tuesday's late US$0.7755/60 and comfortably above chart support at US$0.7720 which had now successfully fended off a week of downside attacks. Resistance had proved just as tough at US$0.7795, however, and dealers felt the risks would be to the downside as long as it stayed intact.</p>
<p>Traders said today's bounce had been aided by sizeable demand out of Tokyo which reinforced talk Japanese funds were developing a taste for Australian government bonds.  </p>
<p>They noted NSW TCorp had successfully launched a 25 billion yen dual currency samurai Tuesday, the first yen/A$ issue in a while, and there was now talk of more bonds in the pipeline. All this helped keep it firm at 97.92/02 yen from 97.65/75 Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was also up on the mark, which had been undermined by a German economic institutes report predicting it would average 1.8000 per US$ in 1998, at 1.3320/37 from 1.3204/18. In trade weighted terms, it crept to 60.2 from a previous 60.1 close.</p>
<p>The local dollar looked less secure against the U.S. dollar, where a steady decline in domestic yields eroded its traditional interest rate advantage.  </p>
<p>Indeed, recent weak employment data, Tuesday's benign result from the national minimum wage talks and expectations today's CPI report would be a good deal softer than forecast, had some in the market betting the Reserve Bank might yet ease again.</p>
<p>The June 90-day bank bill future rose as high as 94.17 this morning, for a 14 basis point gain in less than 24 hours. That implied a rate of 5.83 percent compared to the official cash rate of 6.00 percent.</p>
<p>But the actual CPI figures were much as analysts had originally predicted, which gave some second thoughts and by the close, the contract had slunk back to 94.06.  </p>
<p>The headline consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in the March quarter, taking annual growth to a four-year low of 1.3 percent from 1.5 percent in the December quarter, but this was a little above median forecasts of a 0.1 percent gain.</p>
<p>Furthermore the key underlying rate of inflation stayed at 2.1 percent for the year, whereas some had looked for a dip below the Reserve Bank's 2-3 percent target band, an event which would have certainly stoked speculation of an easing.</p>
<p>The slowdown in CPI was largely due to falling mortgage charges and there were pockets of strength elsewhere, including education, medical, fuel and entertainment costs.  </p>
<p>&quot;The March quarter CPI suggests that the marked decline in inflation over the past year has troughed,&quot; said Bill Shields, chief economist at Macquarie Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Consequently, any further easing of monetary policy will require either weaker than anticipated growth in the economy or a further slowing in aggregate wage growth below the current rate of 4.0 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The next major reading on wages is due May 1 and was likely to show annual growth moving above 4.0 percent. The RBA board meets the week after and governor Ian Macfarlane it to give a keynote address on May 8. -- Wayne Cole 61-2 9373-1800</p>
