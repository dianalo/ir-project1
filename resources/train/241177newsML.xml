<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in lacklustre trade, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said most traders were sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. November employment report, October factory orders and October consumer credit data.</p>
<p>In November's employment report, non-farm payrolls is forecast to rise by 179,000 compared with a 210,000 rise reported in October.</p>
<p>October factory orders is expected to show a gain of 0.2 percent against September's 2.7 percent increase.  </p>
<p>October consumer credit is expected to be around US$3.9 billion from a deficit of $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was quiet and featureless in the morning on some position adjustments. Everyone is waiting for fresh clues to market direction from tonight's release of the (U.S. November) employment report, (October) factory orders and (October) consumer credit figures,&quot; a local dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't think there will be much impact here, as the numbers have been built into the market and most people have squared or are squaring their positions for the weekend,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, weekend, Monday/Tuesday and week-fixed were unchanged from Thursday's common 5-5/16 5-3/16 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Among longer dates, one-month was unchanged at 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent, three-months unchanged at at 5-1/2 5-3/8, six-months unchanged at 5-9/16 5-7/16 and twelve-months unchanged at 5-11/16 5-9/16 percent.</p>
