<title>USA: Stocks tumble, bonds edge higher.</title>
<headline>Stocks tumble, bonds edge higher.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks tumbled Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan signalled that the central bank may raise interest rates next week, but his comments helped drive bonds and the dollar higher.</p>
<p>Oil prices rose. Gold edged lower.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.40 points to 6,820.28, although technology stocks rose after getting battered in recent weeks. In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,526 to 949 on volume of 496 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>While investors were selling interest-rate sensitive issues, they were also opting to seek out bargains elsewhere.</p>
<p>One beneficiary was the battered technology sector, whose recent woes have produced a sharp correction over the last two months.</p>
<p>&quot;We passed the 10 percent correction level yesterday and that seems to be a magical level that brings out the bargain hunters,&quot; said Charlie Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management.</p>
<p>In testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Greenspan said the economy remained strong and called the prospects for continued growth &quot;quite favourable.&quot;</p>
<p>But the Fed chairman also repeatedly stressed the importance of prompt action to keep inflation down before it hurts the economy.</p>
<p>The central bank's policy-makers meet on Tuesday to consider raising short-term rates for the first time in more than two years. Higher rates would slow the economy and prevent higher inflation, but would also crimp corporate profits by raising borrowing costs for consumers and companies.</p>
<p>Investors in the bond market initially showed nervousness about Greenspan's remarks but prices rebounded later in the day. Bond investors are especially worried about inflation since it erodes the returns on their long-term investments.</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury gained 12/32, or $3.75 on a $1,000 bond, lowering its yield to 6.96 percent from 6.99 percent on Wednesday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people think that if the Fed tightens, it's already priced into the bond market,&quot; said Roy Blumberg, chief investment strategist at Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross. &quot;That makes bonds attractive, especially when you consider there's no driving inflation in the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>The recent rise in the 30-year bond yield near 7 percent makes bonds more competitive with stocks as an investment.</p>
<p>In currency trading, the dollar ended broadly higher, boosted by Greenspan's comments, reversing earlier losses that followed a report showing the nation's trade deficit widened to its highest level in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>The dollar climbed against the German mark to 1.6930 late in New York, compared with 1.6803 late on Wednesday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose to 123.75 at the close, compared with 122.82.</p>
<p>In commodity pits, pork prices soared after Taiwan said it was halting pork exports due to a disease outbreak, feeding speculation that the United States would soon be tapped by Japan and other nations for more pork.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork bellies for May delivery jumped the daily limit of 3 cents to 76.30 cents a pound and June hogs rose 2 cents to 78.15 cents a pound.</p>
<p>April crude oil rose 28 cents to $22.32 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>April gold lost 70 cents to $352.20 an ounce on New York's Commodity Exchange.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index fell 74.1 points to 4,258.1, its biggest loss since last December. Tokyo's stock market was closed for a holiday.</p>
