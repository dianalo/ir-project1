<headline>NYMEX electricity futures mixed, PV off new highs.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX electricity futures were trading mixed Monday with Palo Verde (PV) backing off new morning contract highs, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Strength was seen from a strong physicals market, but sources said August PV could weaken before expiring later today.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not going to stay at these new highs,&quot; one Western futures trader said of August PV, adding &quot;historically the contract has backed off new highs.&quot;</p>
<p>As of 1215 EDT, August PV was trading up $1.05 at $38.10 per megawatt hour (MWh) after hitting a new contract high of $38.70 and a low of $38.00, while September was up $1.03 at the day's low of $31.00 after hitting a new contract high of $31.60 per MWh.</p>
<p>August California Oregon Border (COB) was trading down 23 cents at $20.45 following exchanges in a range of $20.35-20.75, while September was up 22 cents at $22.85 after trades in a range of $22.80-23.00 per MWh.</p>
<p>NYMEX said as of 1130 EDT an estimated total of 223 PV and 194 COB contracts had traded.</p>
<p>Both the August COB and PV contracts expire today.</p>
<p>Western U.S. physical power prices were said to be trading higher Monday.</p>
<p>In Western news, southbound capacity on the Pacific Intertie was unlikely to be boosted to 6,900 megawatt (MW) from 6,300 before late this week.</p>
<p>The 750 MW unit 4 at the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico was scheduled to be down until Tuesday after being taken off line late Friday.</p>
<p>Also, Bonneville Power Administration said damage to a fish ladder at the Bonneville Dam on Columbia River in Oregon could reduce power generation at the project by 200 MW for the month or two.</p>
<p>To clear space for future runoffs, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation was set on Sunday to begin releasing extra water and producing more electricity at its Hoover, Davis and Parker hydroelectric dams.</p>
<p>The Hoover hydropower plant in Nevada has a generating capacity of 1,037 MW, Davis in Arizona 240 MW and Parker in California 120 MW.</p>
<p>The 1,221 MW unit 2 at the Palo Verde nuclear complex near Phoenix, Arizona was expected to begin slowly ramping down to between 60 and 80 percent of capacity by September 6, when it was scheduled to shut for refueling.</p>
<p>In its latest six to 10 day forecast, Weather Services Corp said the Southwest would experience near to slightly above normal temperatures across the region, while most of the Pacific Northwest would experience seasonal temperatures.</p>
