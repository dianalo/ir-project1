<p>---------------------------(AUG 19)----------------------------</p>
<p>New Zealand bank bill yields closed higher on Tuesday following a fresh slide in the New Zealand dollar.</p>
<p>The kiwi had a topsy-turvy day trading, ending at US$0.6390/97 after trading a 0.6380-0.6428 range.</p>
<p>The bill market was struggling to keep the Monetary Conditions Index within acceptable bounds following the Reserve Bank's warning on Monday and has been largely reduced to currency watching. It closed 100 below the bank's desired level for the quarter.  </p>
<p>A foreign exchange dealer said the kiwi market appeared to have gotten itself short after being positioned the opposite way on Monday and a slight bid tone at the close.</p>
<p>&quot;It's bounced back and the market is now short. I see the topside being tested,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bond dealers were a little puzzled about why the long end was sold so strongly. The 11/06 bonds ended nine basis points higher at 7.15 percent.</p>
<p>One dealer said there was hedging of fixed mortgages which accounted for some of the weakness.</p>
<p>But he said it was a &quot;skinny and skittery market&quot;.  </p>
<p>Another dealer said Real Estate figures showed there was still some inflation pressure coming through in the Auckland housing market.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank's Financial Markets manager David Archer was reported to have told a weekend conference that the bank was still concerned about Auckland house prices.</p>
<p>A bond dealer said New Zealand's spreads to Australia had widened significantly.</p>
<p>Even a $100 million eurokiwi overnight appeared to have no positive impact.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a poor performance,&quot; he said.  </p>
