<p>The long-suffering basketball players of Dynamo Moscow, who have not been paid since the summer, got their reward for calling off a strike by beating Sevilla in overtime in a EuroLeague match on Thursday.</p>
<p>Tied 65-65 with the Spaniards at full time in their Group D game in Moscow, Dynamo ran out 79-75 winners after the extra period. Igor Grachev was the home side's top scorer with 24 points.</p>
<p>Sports-loving President Boris Yeltsin stepped in on Wednesday by signing a decree ordering the government to return state assets, including sports facilities, to the Dynamo sports club, a sprawling organisation which, as in Soviet times, is run by and for the police and other security forces.</p>
<p>The basketball team dropped a threat to strike and agreed to play Thursday's game and next week's final Group D tie against Partizan in Belgrade after Russian Basketball Federation officials promised action in getting their wages paid.</p>
<p>The Dynamo players are among millions of Russians, including hundreds of thousands of striking coal miners, who are caught in a web of company and state debts, unpaid wages and tax arrears.</p>
<p>Thursday's victory was only Dynam's second EuroLeague success in nine games and comes too late to avoid finishing in the bottom three in Group D which means a tougher schedule in the second phase starting in January.</p>
