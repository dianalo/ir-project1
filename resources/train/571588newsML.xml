<p>South African gold shares ended firm as bullion broke out of its recent tight range of $340-$344 per ounce, to bounce to its highest fix in five weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold shares are better with bullion now sitting above $345, but they are not running quite as high,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $345.80 in the afternoon -- its highest fixing since April 14 hoisting the South African all gold index up nearly two percent or 23.2 points to 1,237.6.</p>
<p>Dealers said bullion's rally had come on the back of the slide in the dollar and U.S. bond yield values over the past couple of days.</p>
<p>South African gold shares were seen stronger next week if the yellow metal held its gains.</p>
<p>Industrial shares ended flat after starting firmer on Wall Street's overnight 50-point gain.</p>
<p>Dealers said local institutions entered the market in the morning after a lengthy absence but pulled out by noon, leaving industrials seeking direction.</p>
<p>Futures activity helped prop up the index around lunchtime but a late squaring of positions ahead of the weekend left the index virtually unchanged.</p>
<p>The market was seen stronger next week after a lethargic week.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been very lethargic and should start rising. The Dow has been rising and we have to catch up,&quot; said Greg Amoils, a portfolio manager at Irish Menell Rosenberg.</p>
<p>The overall index ended 16.5 points higher at 7,179.4 helped by the gold index's improvement and a 3.8 point rise in the industrial index to 8,501.2 points.  </p>
<p>Main features on the bourse included media group Sasani which ended 10 cents firmer on rumours that it was planning to buy entertainment business Interleisure.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rumours stemmed from the fact that investment holding firm Servgro, which together with Kersaf owns Interleisure, was in the process of unbundling its holdings.</p>
<p>However, Kersaf told Reuters on Friday it was still evaluating its options with regards to Interleisure.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking into the future holding and direction of Interleisure in the light of the Servgro unbundling...,&quot; Kersaf chairman Buddy Hawton said.</p>
<p>He said talks had been held with a number of parties, including Sasani, but that no decision had yet been made.</p>
<p>Sasani could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Consmining was the most actively traded share on the exchange gaining five cents to 87 cents in a volume worth 8.9 million rand.</p>
<p>Dealers said reports that Randgold's  commercial director Brett Kebble would spearhead the establishment of South Africa's first resource bank, via Consolidated Mining of which he is chairman, kindled interest in the stock.</p>
<p>Romatex dropped 10 cents to 256 cents after issuing a profit warning in the morning.</p>
<p>Romatex said it forecast a loss before tax for the nine months to end-June 1997 and major shareholders agreed that the only way to arrest the loss would be to rationalise the company's activities with those of Confram.  </p>
<p>Near-dated share futures were mixed in late trade amid a squaring of positions on industrial contracts. Gold contracts were firm as bullion surged above the $345 level.</p>
<p>The June all-share contract was at 6,650/75 from 6,645, the industrial contract was at 8,355/65 from 8,371 and the gold contract at 867/75 from 858</p>
