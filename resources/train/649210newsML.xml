<headline>IPE Brent ends weak after posting new 12-month low.</headline>

<p>IPE Brent crude dipped in late trade to a 12-month low as an early bounce evaporated amid talk of rising U.S. product stocks, dealers said.</p>
<p>July Brent closed down 6 cents at $17.50 a barrel, the lowest seen on the prompt contract since May 1996, extending a $2-slide since the beginning of June.</p>
<p>&quot;It dropped to new lows but the market was very thin below $17.50,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>Brent bounced early after managing to hold key support at $17.54 on Monday but lost ground ahead of the release of American Petroleum Institute (API) inventory data.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything was looking oversold so a correction was due but then a few pre-API jitters set in,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw some strength when New York opened but then that died away,&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>Rising U.S. crude and gasoline stocks gave investment funds an excuse to bale out of the market last Friday and this week's API figures could again set short-term market direction.</p>
<p>Refinery runs are expected to remain at or near record levels in Tuesday's API report, leading to a rise in distillate and gasoline stocks, according to a survey by Reuters.</p>
<p>Distillate stocks are expected to show a rise of 2.5 million barrels in the week to June 6. The build in gasoline should be more modest at around one million barrels, according to the analysts surveyed.</p>
<p>Earlier, IPE June gas oil closed $1.50 firmer at $161.50 a tonne.</p>
