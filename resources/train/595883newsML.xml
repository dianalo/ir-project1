<p>Germany's Bankgesellschaft Berlin AG which is believed to be interested in acquiring BHF-Bank AG, said on Monday it was interested in acquisitions to strengthen its business but added that it was not in takeover talks at present.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Bankgesellschaft said the bank was thinking about which business areas could be strengthened through acquisitions and that several banks in Germany and Europe were possible targets.</p>
<p>&quot;The impression that everything is focused on BHF-Bank is wrong,&quot; the spokeswoman said in response to a Reuter enquiry.</p>
<p>She added that negotiations about a merger with Norddeutsche Landesbank (NordLB) took precedence at present, with the main issue being the valuations of the two banks.</p>
<p>Berliner Zeitung reported on Saturday that Bankgesellschaft had identified Frankfurt-based BHF-Bank as an institution whose business would complement its own activities.  </p>
<p>BHF-Bank's shares had surged on Friday following a report in Boersen-Zeitung that Bankgesellschaft was interested in buying a stake of at least 75 percent in it. German markets are closed on Monday for the Pentecost public holiday.</p>
<p>Both banks have denied they are in talks and major shareholders in BHF also said they did not plan to sell their stakes.</p>
<p>However, Bankgesellschaft chief executive Wolfgang Rupf was quoted in Saturday's edition of Boersen-Zeitung as saying BHF was one of several banks that had been discussed by Bankgesellschaft's management board.</p>
<p>BfG Bank, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, had also been discussed, Rupf was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>BHF's asset management unit Frankfurt Trust would be an &quot;interesting addition&quot; to Bankgesellschaft although it would unrealistic just to buy the bank's fund arm, Rupf added.</p>
<p>Asked if Berlin-based Bankgesellschaft was interested in buying BHF because it wanted to strengthen its position in the Frankfurt financial market, Rupf said, &quot;We have to expand our activities in Frankfurt in any case.&quot;</p>
