<p>Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said on Monday he was cautiously optimistic about forthcoming talks with an International Monetary Fund mission on releasing the next tranche of a $10 billion loan to Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;We have hopes for a positive decision though we are not entirely confident,&quot; Livshits told a news conference after meeting an advance mission of experts from the IMF.</p>
<p>Last month, a fund mission abruptly left Moscow without recommending payment of the latest $330 million tranche. The mission was worried about the impact on fiscal policy of Russia's low level of tax collection.  </p>
<p>In the first nine months of the year, Russia managed to raise only 74 percent of the money outlined in the budget.</p>
<p>Tom Wolf, head of the fund's representative office in Moscow, told Reuters a group of IMF experts studying the level of tax revenue had started work in Moscow on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The first issue the experts raised was budget revenues,&quot; said Livshits. &quot;I replied that, in our opinion, the baby is getting better. In the first 10 days of November, there have been no problems with collecting taxes.&quot;</p>
<p>The fund's mission arrives in Moscow on Thursday for its regular monthly monitoring of the Russian economy. The mission will be headed by IMF official Yusuke Horiguchi, who arrived with the experts on Sunday.</p>
