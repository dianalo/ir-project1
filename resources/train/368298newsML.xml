<p>South Korea will supply 1.4 trillion won this year to stop Hanbo Steel Co's financial failure causing insolvencies of small and medium-sized firms, the Finance and Economy Ministry said on Monday.  </p>
<p>The ministry said in a statement the government would also provide 700 billion won to banks for use to rediscount commercial bills issued by small and medium-sized firms.</p>
<p>The statement said the 700 billion won would be raised by issuing government bonds, while part of the 1.4 trillion won of funds would come from the central bank.</p>
<p>It did not give further details on fund-raising.</p>
<p>The failure of Hanbo Steel, the nation's second largest steelmaker, has made it hard for small and medium-sized firms to get bank loans or have their commercial bills discounted.  </p>
<p>The steel firm, flagship unit of the nation's 14th largest conglomerate Hanbo Group, was declared insolvent on January 23.</p>
<p>Pohang Iron and Steel Co last week accepted a request from creditor banks to help run the troubled steelmaker, which is now seeking court receivership.</p>
<p>The statement also said the government would release 561.8 billion won, allocated for various aid programmes to support small and medium-sized companies, in February. The release was originally scheduled for the first half of this year.</p>
<p>In the manufacturing sector, companies with 300 employees or less are classified as medium-sized while those with 50 employees or less small firms.</p>
