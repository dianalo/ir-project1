<text>
<p>Austria's coalition government partners on Sunday agreed to sell the state's 70 percent stake in Creditanstalt to market leader Bank Austria for a total of 17.2 billion schillings ($1.5 billion).</p>
<p>The leaders of the dominant Social Democrats and their junior partner, the conservative People's Party, agreed on the following details:</p>
<p>-- Voting rights held by the City of Vienna's foundation Anteilsverwaltung Zentralsparkasse (AVZ) and the Vienna City Holding company in Bank Austria will be reduced to below 25 percent over a period of five years.</p>
<p>The stakes will be diluted by a series of capital increases or through a straight share sale. About half of the entire package will be put into a fiduciary account immediately.</p>
<p>Market conditions permitting, the municipal bodies' influence will be cut to below 20 percent within a further two years.</p>
<p>-- The state's 19 percent equity stake in Bank Austria will by sold via the bourse before the end of the year.</p>
<p>-- Creditanstalt will remain an independent bank for at least five years.</p>
<p>-- Bank Austria guarantees Creditanstalt employees' jobs. Reductions will be achieved through natural attrition only.</p>
<p>-- Creditanstalt will sell its stakes in Investkredit, which is active in municipal financing, and in Kontrollbank, the government's financing agent.</p>
<p>AVZ will sell its 56 percent stake in GiroCredit, the country's number three bank, and will not take part in the privatisation of postal savings bank P.S.K., scheduled for the current year.</p>
<p>-- Bank Austria will not strip Creditanstalt of its assets. Stakes held by Creditanstalt in several of Austria's smaller regional banks can be sold off.</p>
<p>-- Bank Austria's liabilities will continue to be effectively guaranteed by the City of Vienna, but the bank will have to pay a fee for the guarantee.</p>
<p>-- Bank Austria will buy out small shareholders of Creditanstalt, either by offering them shares in Bank Austria or by offering them 722.50 schillings in cash for each ordinary share held up to a total shareholding of 200,000 schillings.</p>
<p>-- Creditanstalt employees will be able to buy Creditanstalt shares worth a total of 500 million schillings.</p>
<p>-- A new privatisation law will be introduced, stipulating that the government has to agree on all tender offers for state assets as well as the choice of buyers.</p>
<p>-- The new merged bank will be expected to bring its accounting procedures into line with European laws regulating the consolidation of equity stakes by December 21, 1998.</p>
<p>-- Austria will introduce a new law on takeovers.</p>
<p>-- Austria's law on savings banks will be adjusted to reflect new, toughened regulations on munipcial guarantees for banks' liabilities.</p>
<p>-- The Vienna stock exchange will be turned into a shareholding company with the full participation of listed companies, investors and banks.</p>
<p>-- The government has to draw up proposals regarding changes in the takeover and savings bank laws, new accounting procedures and the Vienna bourse by the summer.</p>
<p>-- The government's research and development budget as well as its budget for export promotion will be increased by one billion schillings each in 1998 and 1999 with funds received from the sale of state assets.</p>
<p>-- If AVZ fails to draw up a firm plan to reduce its influence on Bank Austria within four weeks, the sale of Creditanstalt to Bank Austria will be declared invalid. ($ = 11.14 Austrian Schillings)</p>
