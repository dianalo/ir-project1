<p>Polish shares set a 33-month high for the third straight session on Friday, but analysts saw them falling or at least slowing growth in a profit-taking correction early next week.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index rose 1.1 percent, to 15,418.9 and turnover rose 11.5 percent to 211.6 million zlotys ($73 million) on both markets as 46 issues rose, 21 fell and 17 were flat.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems there will be a kind of halt early next week, it's difficult to say whether it will mean falls or only slowing growth,&quot; said Wojciech Kossuth, an analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage.</p>
<p>Some analysts said they expected a fall of about two percent on Monday, but were uncertain about the market's direction later in the week.</p>
<p>Analysts said that in the case of a fall, 15,000 points should provide strong support for the WIG index.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI units rose 2.7 percent in a 43.4-million-zloty ($15 million) turnover.</p>
<p>Pharmeceutical firm Polfa Kutno SA, Friday's top gainer, jumped 10 percent but analysts could not find a justification for such a strong gain.</p>
<p>Industrial boilermaker Rafako SA soared 9.9 percent in heavy 10-million-zloty ($3.4 million) trade, extending its surge on the back of Wednesday's announcement it was seeking a strategic investor.</p>
