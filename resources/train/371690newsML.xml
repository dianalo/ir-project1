<p>A move by the Slovak government to participate in central bank (NBS) board meetings has prompted analysts to voice concerns over the bank's independence, and raised expectations of an interest rate cut.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the government said it had approved a measure to allow Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik to participate in central bank board meetings with an advisory right to enhance the cooperation between the government and the NBS.</p>
<p>The move comes on the heels of last week's decision to appoint former Deputy Finance Minister Jozef Magula, who is seen as pro-government, as a board member.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a move is understandably negative and alarming news. The government is putting pressure on the institution of the central bank's independence,&quot; Zdenek Lukas of Wiener Institut fur Internationale Wirtschaftsverleiche (WIIW) told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The government appears to have the intention of loosening (the NBS's) until now restrictive monetary policy, which may lead to an inflation increase in Slovakia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Added one local economist: &quot;I expect the government's pressure on the NBS to rise further, plus the parliamentary election is nearing.&quot; A general vote is expected in Slovakia in the autumn of 1998.</p>
<p>The government said it had taken the move to ensure better cooperation between it and the central bank. Kozlik will not have a vote at board meetings, &quot;but his voice can influence the overall vote, of course&quot; Ministry Spokesman Jozef Mach told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kozlik has repeatedly criticised the NBS's monetary policy, which was further tightened at the end of 1996 after the government approved a fiscal deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP for this year, after a 0.4 percent surplus in 1996.</p>
<p>The squeeze pushed interbank money market rates to record highs of 26 percent and above, and helped to create wild fluctations on the market and a flood of foreign funds.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected the recent government moves to lead to a decline in rates, but they said the NBS, which has yet to react on the moves, had left them to speculation on how deep and fast the fall would be.</p>
<p>&quot;The threat is a possible steep decline in the interest rates, which could prompt a pullout of the foreign capital and likely to leave some very unfavourable effects,&quot; Vladimir Kuklis, a CSOB Bank analyst, said.</p>
<p>But, added Martin Barto of ING Barings: &quot;We may see a slow unravelling of the recent monetary regulations and a gradual liquidity inflow. Maybe the 14 percent level is a desired target for stability.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that foreign inflows should continue, and from the short and medium-term point of view there should be no dramatic changes in the economy, &quot;though looking further into the future one must see an ugly face (from the moves).&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts also warned that private sector debt, already already a concern, may increase if the government influences the board to loosen its grip on the money supply.</p>
