<p>Faced with a dismal weather forecast, NASA called off its plans to launch shuttle Columbia this weekend and rescheduled the start of its 16-day mission for Tuesday, space agency officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meteorologists had painted a bleak picture of strong gusty winds, cloudy skies and rain for planned Saturday and Sunday launch attempts, but forecast better conditions by Tuesday.</p>
<p>NASA managers decided at a meeting held late Wednesday afternoon to put the countdown on hold until the weather improved.</p>
<p>&quot;They had a solid no-go forecast through to Sunday,&quot; said NASA spokesman Rob Navias. &quot;In requesting Tuesday we have given ourselves an opportunity to let this weather clear.&quot;</p>
<p>Blastoff from Florida's Kennedy Space Centre was retargeted for 2:53 p.m. EST (1953 GMT) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, NASA had delayed the mission by one day so an unmanned rocket, grounded by high winds, could make a second launch attempt on Thursday (tomorrow).</p>
<p>Columbia was already running a week late due to booster rocket problems.</p>
<p>The shuttle's crew of five will wait out the delay at the Florida launch site, Navias said.</p>
<p>The astronauts are due to spend 16 days in orbit conducting scientific research with a pair of free-flying satellites. Two spacewalks are also planned to practice for the construction of the international space station.</p>
