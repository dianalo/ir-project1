<p>Consumer prices rose a scant 0.1 percent for the fourth month in a row in June, advancing at their slowest pace in 11 years during the first half of the year, the Labor Department said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also rose only 0.1 percent last month, the department said. In the first half of 1997, the core rate rose at its slowest pace in 32 years, it said.  </p>
<p>Wall Street analysts had expected the Consumer Price Index, the government's most widely used measure of inflation, to rise 0.2 percent in June.</p>
<p>During the first half of the year, consumer prices rose at a 1.4 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate, compared with 3.3 percent in 1996. Declines in energy costs and restrained gains in food prices were largely responsible for holding down the increase, which was the smallest for the first half of the year since 1986, the department said.</p>
<p>Excluding food and energy, consumer prices rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first half of 1997, their slowest pace since the first half of 1965.</p>
<p>The report, which showed no sign of a pick-up in inflation, comes with the economy ploughing into its seventh year of steady growth -- including a surge earlier this year -- without any serious threat of an acceleration in consumer prices.</p>
<p>After growing at a brisk 5.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter of the year, most economists believe growth slowed to a 2-2.5 percent pace in the second quarter. They expect the pace to rev back up to between 3 and 4 percent in the second half of 1997 as consumers increase their spending.</p>
<p>With little wage pressure present despite tight labour markets and prices of finished goods charged by producers having declined for six months in a row, most economists still see no inflation on the horizon, even if the pace of growth picks up in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>The June rise in consumer prices reflected an acceleration in housing and medical costs that was largely restrained by declines in transportation and apparel costs and flat energy prices, the department said.</p>
<p>Food prices rose 0.2 percent last month after a 0.4 percent rise in May. Fresh vegetable prices rose 2.4 percent, pork rose 1 percent and fresh fruits fell 1 percent.</p>
<p>Energy costs were unchanged last month after declining sharply over the previous three months. Gasoline prices plunged 0.9 percent in June and home heating oil fell 0.7 percent, while natural gas and electricity costs rose.</p>
<p>Prices of new cars retreated 0.1 percent in June for the second consecutive month, while housing costs rose 0.3 percent after a 0.1 percent May rise.</p>
<p>Medical costs rose 0.2 percent in June after rising 0.3 percent in May and were up 2.9 percent over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Tobacco prices fell 0.9 percent in June, the largest drop since a 5.1 percent decrease in September 1993, while entertainment costs rose 0.5 percent last month.</p>
<p>Service costs, which account for more than half of the overall Consumer Price Index, rose 0.3 percent, while commodity prices fell 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>The Consumer Price Index stood at 160.3 in June, meaning that a basket of goods that cost $100 in the 1982-84 period cost $160.3 last month.</p>
