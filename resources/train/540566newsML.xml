<p>Bulgaria's Foreign Affairs Minister Stoyan Stalev called on Friday for a special status for former communist countries which fail to win NATO membership at the first attempt.</p>
<p>Declining to accept his country would not gain alliance membership &quot;in the first wave&quot;, Stalev said countries left outside should be accorded a special status differentiating them from partnership nations not seeking full membership.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be a special procedure for countries that will not be invited in first time round,&quot; he told reporters after meeting the 16 alliance ambassadors at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO's) Brussels headquarters.</p>
<p>NATO sources said Sofia was looking for regular &quot;16+1&quot; meetings and other regular bilateral contacts in addition to those offered to some 27 Partnership for Peace (PFP) many of which do not want alliance membership.</p>
<p>NATO countries are to invite certain countries to join the alliance at a special summit in Madrid next July. A total of 12 countries want to join, but only three -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- are expected to be successful.</p>
<p>Stalev told the ambassadors his country wanted to be considered as a serious applicant for inclusion in the first wave and jointly with Romania.</p>
<p>&quot;The south-east region of Europe is very important for wider European stability,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bulgaria's reformist coalition which was reelected in polls last weekend has reversed the policy of the previous government and made NATO membership its top foreign policy goal.</p>
