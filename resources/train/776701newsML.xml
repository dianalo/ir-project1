<p>The dollar looked poised to continue its relentless rally against the mark but took a breather in European afternoon trading from its rise to near-eight year highs above 1.87 marks, analysts said.</p>
<p>The heady pace of the dollar rally - about 12 pfennigs since the beginning of July and three pfennigs alone since Friday - triggered profit-taking. Weakness in U.S. asset markets also weighed on the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>But the &quot;win-win&quot; scenario of a healthy U.S. economy and expectations that German growth is too weak to withstand sustained rate rises was expected to add fuel to the dollar rally, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The state of the U.S. economy relative to most of Europe is the engine behind the dollar's rally, and we don't expect a fundamental change to that scenario to happen soon,&quot; said Klaus Wiener, economist at West-LB in Duesseldorf, Germany.</p>
<p>Doubts that the Bundesbank will act on money market rates to put a brake on the dollar was also likely to support further gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Mark weakness has prompted the Bundesbank in recent weeks to foster talk that it could use variable-rate tenders to nudge its securities repurchase rate up from a record low of 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>The dollar fell below 1.87 again after hitting a high at 1.8730, a level not seen since since October 1989. At 1455 GMT it was at 1.8635/45, off its 1.8730 peak and compared to 1.8631/36 late on Friday in Europe. Dollar/yen was at 118.12/18 from 118.37/47 at the previous European close.</p>
<p>&quot;What we have seen recently is nothing else but sabre-rattling from the Bundesbank. We don't expect a change to German interest rates, and we are bullish for dollar/mark to go to 1.90,&quot; said Wiener.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar/mark scenario is bullish because the German economy is not yet in a fit state for a rate rise whereas the U.S. has the rosy scenario of steady growth and low inflation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dollar strength gave the mark a boost against many of its European crosses as they succumbed to the U.S. currency's rally.</p>
<p>The mark rose to a six-week high of 979.60 lire as the dollar pushed to 1,836.45 lire, its highest in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Talk the Bundesbank could nudge its repo rate higher accelerated when the central bank decided at its July 24 council meeting to leave its options open in the second part of its four-week summer recess - by not announcing repos for that period in advance.</p>
<p>German data out this week were expected to confirm that the fundamentals behind the dollar/mark rally is still intact.</p>
<p>Such expectations were little changed by a report which showed German industrial output rose 1.4 percent in June, even though the German Economics Ministry said the increase was likely to be revised up substantially. June manufacturing orders and July jobless statistics are also due this week. &quot;German figures have room to disappoint and this will give the dollar a lift against the mark,&quot; said Steve Barrow, analyst at Banque National de Paris in London.</p>
<p>By contrast, U.S. economic reports on Friday showed growth was stronger than expected and revived speculation of higher U.S. interest rates in the coming months.</p>
<p>While the dollar also hit new highs against other European currencies like the Swiss franc and the Italian lira, it made less headway against the yen. Expectations Japan will protest against dollar gains above 120 yen and talk of higher Japanese interest rates hampered the dollar's progress, dealers said.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency reached a four-year high of 1.5350 Swiss francs, before easing to 1.5250/56 in late trade here.</p>
