<title>RUSSIA: Army reform was a task too far for Russia minister.</title>
<headline>Army reform was a task too far for Russia minister.</headline>

<p>Igor Rodionov, brought into the government to spearhead the reform of Russia's demoralised and underfed armed forces, paid the price for being unable to fulfil the daunting task.</p>
<p>The silver-haired general, a tough professional and a career military man, was sacked on Thursday by President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>He was appointed 10 months ago, charged with converting Russia's conscript army into a tight professional force by 2000.</p>
<p>Rodionov, 60, stepped down from the military when he reached retirement age, becoming a rare Russian commodity -- a civilian defence minister.</p>
<p>He was a tough critic of both the Kremlin and the army for covering up the alarming state of the once-mighty armed forces and warned that their ability to control Russia's huge nuclear arsenals could be in question.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who had praised Rodionov's openness on this subject, said in February he fully backed his minister's efforts to improve the army's lot and told him that he should feel safe about his job, despite speculation then that he could be fired.</p>
<p>But Rodionov later fell out with members of Yeltsin's entourage, accusing a loyal Yeltsin aide and secretary of powerful Defence Council, Yuri Baturin, of playing down the army's problems.</p>
<p>Rodionov retained his job during a big cabinet reshuffle in March, although Yeltsin accused him of whining, with his persistent complaints about the poor state of the armed forces.</p>
<p>Rodionov, backed by many other Kremlin officials, warned that promised reforms would cost Moscow dear, not least because professional soldiers would need professional pay.</p>
<p>He has said the 2000 deadline to build a professional army was unlikely to be met and he criticised a pact charting relations between Russia and NATO. Yeltsin praised the agreement as a breakthrough in relationships with the alliance.</p>
<p>The military widely respect Rodionov, who is a veteran of the Afghan war, as a professional.</p>
<p>Experts hesitate to define him as a hardliner, as he is relatively soft-spoken compared to his hawkish and unpopular predecessor, General Pavel Grachev.</p>
<p>But Rodionov commanded Soviet forces in the Transcaucasus when his troops broke up a pro-independence rally in the Georgian capital in 1989, killing about 20 people.</p>
<p>The incident, in which troops used shovels, earned him the grim reputation of &quot;Butcher of Tbilisi&quot; in Georgia. But many Russian officials have since exonerated him and say the true blame lay elsewhere.</p>
<p>Rodionov was pulled out of Georgia after the rally and he became head of the General Staff's influential military academy in 1990 -- a powerful post which gave him background information on many of the rising stars in the Russian military.</p>
<p>Born on October 1, 1936, in the Penza region of central Russia, he graduated from the Orlov tank college, the Malinovsky armoured tank academy and the General Staff Military Academy.</p>
<p>He started out as a tank platoon commander and saw active service in Afghanistan from 1985 to 1986 before becoming commander of Soviet forces in the Transcaucasus two years later.</p>
<p>In the final years of the Soviet Union, Rodionov was a member of the Soviet parliament, then called the Congress of People's Deputies, and was known as a vociferous critic of the foreign policy of reformist communist leader Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
