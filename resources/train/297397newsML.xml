<p>Following are comments from U.S. economists after the Labor Department reported a 0.5-percent rise in the December Producer Price Index (PPI) compared to a 0.4-percent gain in November.</p>
<p>Economists in a Reuters survey had expected a 0.3-percent rise in December PPI and a 0.1-percent rise in the core rate, which excludes food and energy items. Core rose 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>KEITH EDMONDS, IBJ INTERNATIONAL, LONDON: &quot;It's a little bit disappointing that we saw such a rise in the overall figure.&quot;  </p>
<p>Edmonds said he doubted the figures would have any implications for the Federal Reserve and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Edmonds was speaking on Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>MIKE NIEMIRA, VICE PRESIDENT AND AN ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI: &quot;It's actually good news, bad news: good news in terms of the core, bad new in terms of the energy story. Obviously the higher energy does have an impact on consumer spending, especially in the Northeast which may be a little bit more sensitive to higher energy prices.  </p>
<p>&quot;From the (Treasury) market standpoint, I think it's good news. From the core standpoint, its coming in better than expected and I think that's the way, basically, the bond market took it.</p>
<p>&quot;The core, intermediate and crude numbers look favorable and no big deal on those. The bottom line good news for the bond market,&quot; Niemira added.</p>
<p>ASTRID ADOLFSON, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT AND AN ECONOMIST, MCM MONEYWATCH INC: &quot;It was all energy prices. But it was expected that food (prices) would fall more and they didn't, so that is why the overall was up 0.5 percent, higher than expected.</p>
<p>&quot;I think (Treasury market traders) are trying to figure out where they should be. It's not surprising that they jumped on (PPI) because it was a benign inflation report, but I think there is still probably a limit as to how high we'll go before tomorrow's (employment) report,&quot; she added.</p>
