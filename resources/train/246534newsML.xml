<p>Accused &quot;Unabomber&quot; Theodore Kaczynski pleaded not guilty to a murder charge on Tuesday by video teleconference, but a judge reserved a decision on whether to try him in New Jersey before a separate trial in California.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Dickinson Debevoise of Newark federal court said he would rule in a week on Kaczynski, who faces federal murder charges in two states for a bombing spree that began in the 1970s.</p>
<p>In the video conference from Sacramento, Kaczynski, wearing a white shirt and a brown jacket without a tie, looked calm and answered &quot;Yes, I do&quot; when the judge asked him whether he waived his right to a trial on the New Jersey indictment.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in New Jersey want a separate trial in the state to begin in June. His California trial is scheduled to start on Nov. 12 in Sacramento, where he is being held without bail.</p>
<p>He faces charges in New Jersey in the 1984 death of an advertising executive killed by a parcel bomb mailed to his home. Authorities alleged that Kaczynski mailed the bomb from San Francisco.</p>
<p>Kaczynski's attorneys have argued that the charges be consolidated into one case in California, where Kaczynski is accused of four bomb attacks that killed two people and injured two others.</p>
<p>The judge said that if he decides to hold a trial in New Jersey, then it would not start until after the end of the California trial.</p>
<p>&quot;That would create too much confusion to have a trial here that may overlap with a trial in Sacramento,&quot; Judge Debevoise said.</p>
<p>Kaczynski, a former mathematics professor who became a recluse, was arrested in April at his one-room cabin in rural Montana.</p>
