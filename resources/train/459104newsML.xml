<title>USA: NYMEX electricity settles higher on shortcovering.</title>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures settled higher Friday on a small technical bounce and shortcovering ahead of April contracts' expiration next Tuesday, market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;You're seeing a little bit of shortcovering before expiration,&quot; said a Houston futures trader.</p>
<p>April California-Oregon Border (COB) futures ended up 24 cents at $10.35 a megawatt hour (MWh), near its session high of $10.40.</p>
<p>May COB finished down eight cents at $10.35. Deferred COB settled five to 15 cents higher.</p>
<p>April Palo Verde (PV) ended up 12 cents after trading in a 20 cent rage. May PV finished down 10 cents at $14.15. Other active PV months settled five to 10 cents lower.</p>
<p>Overall fundamental picture for the western power market remained bearish due to light spot demand and rising hydroelectric production in the Northwest, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's still room for this to move down,&quot; the Houston trader said.</p>
<p>Weekday firm, peak electricity prices at most key western trading points fell again today with those at COB falling 25-50 cents to $11.50-13.00 and at PV tumbling 75 cents to $2.50 to $14.50-15.50.</p>
<p>Spot power supplies in the Southwest are expected to steadily rise in the coming days with scheduled startup of a couple of large generating units and increased power flow on the Pacific Intertie.</p>
<p>Edison International said it plans to restart the 1,070 megawatt San Onofre 2 nuclear unit in California on March 26 following a shutdown Wednesday to repair a small leak in a valve in an internal water cooling system.</p>
<p>A 750 MW unit at the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico was expected to restart Saturday after being shut earlier this month for unplanned repair work.</p>
<p>The Western Systems Coordinating Council today approved to boost the capacity of Pacific Intertie by about 25 percent to 6,250 MW from 5,200 MW. The North-South power flow on the transmission line may begin ramping up as early as Friday night.</p>
<p>Offsetting some of the supply increase, a 750 MW unit at the Navajo coal-fired plant in Arizona was said to be having problems which might require the unit to go off-line over the weekend.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Northwest would average below normal in the north and near normal in the south over the next six to 10 days, while the Southwest was expected to have temperatures above normal through the same period.</p>
<p>NYMEX estimated 308 COB and 249 PV contracts were sold, compared with 263 COB and 295 PV lots yesterday.</p>
