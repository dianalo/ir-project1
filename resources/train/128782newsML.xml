<p>The forces of ousted Afghan government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood have made major gains north of Kabul, witnesses said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Backed by the artillery of ethnic Uzbek chief Abdul Rashid Dostum, Masood launched two thrusts towards Kabul, taking Bagram airbase 60 km (40 miles) from the capital and the market town of Qarabagh.</p>
<p>By dusk, Masood's men were battling for the town of Kara Kalan, another five km (three miles) along the main road to the capital, the witnesses said.</p>
<p>The purist Islamic Taleban, who took Kabul three weeks ago, sent reinforcements, including tanks and mobile multiple rocket launchers from the city towards the fighting.</p>
<p>The Taleban authorities in Kabul were not available for comment on the setbacks for a movement that had swept all before it to conquer three-quarters of Afghanistan in just two years.</p>
<p>Reporters who visited the front from Masood's side found his jubilant men in firm control of Bagram and Qarabagh with more reinforcements arriving.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we're ready to push them (the Taleban) out of Kabul,&quot; said beaming Masood commander Karim Mohab Rahman in Qarabagh.</p>
<p>&quot;We captured Qarabagh last night at about two o'clock in the morning. We came with three tanks and 600 men and the Taleban withdrew without a fight,&quot; Rahman said.</p>
<p>Tanks swarming with Masood's northern ethnic Tajik soldiers churned south to Qarabagh, a 45-minute drive from Kabul, accompanied by truck-mounted anti-aircraft and multi-rocket launchers.</p>
<p>The capture of Bagram was the first joint operation between Masood and Dostum. But the Uzbek commander did not commit his infantry to the offensive, which analysts saw as a sign he was keeping his options open.</p>
<p>The largely ethnic Pashtun Taleban appeared to be setting up defensive positions south of Bagram on the so-called New Road, a parallel route to Kabul, and pouring rocket fire in the direction of Qarabagh.</p>
<p>Reporters from Kabul were halted about 20 km (12 miles) short of Bagram and shelling made it difficult to pinpoint positions. But the Taleban were preparing defensive positions much closer to Kabul than those they occupied on Friday.</p>
<p>The loss of Bagram will be a major psychological blow to the ultra-conservative Taleban, even though their small air force has been attacking Masood's positions from Kabul airport, not from the airbase.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Masood's heavily armed men strolled around the now dilapidated airbase from which the Soviet military threw its weight behind a communist government in Kabul in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Eight apparently useless fighter planes, several transport aircraft and helicopter carcasses of that era were parked in the base, but Masood's men said the Taleban had mined the area around them and it was not possible to inspect them.</p>
<p>Masood's men were also in control of the adjacent town of Bagramwhich bore few signs of recent battle.</p>
<p>The buildings were decrepit and rusty and bearing the scars of previous fighting over a base that sits on a dusty plain with snow-capped peaks in the background.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether Masood intended to keep driving south to Kabul, which he has twice demanded the Taleban leave, or give negotiators time to make a deal.</p>
<p>Several days of talks between the Taleban and Dostum this week have raised hopes that Kabul, extensively damaged in four years of faction fighting, would be spared another battle.</p>
<p>There has been no firm word of any outcome of the Pakistan-brokered talks, but Afghan watchers in Kabul said it appeared the two sides were still far apart.</p>
