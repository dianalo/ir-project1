<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia managed futures fund market seen growing.</title>

<p>The market for managed futures funds in Australia has grown to A$400 million from nearly nothing two years ago as investors turn more to leveraged investment instruments, the Asia Pacific Managed Futures Association (APMFA) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>This compares with over US$30 billion under management in the United States, although the Australian market is poised for further growth because investors are seeking out potentially higher yielding investments, APMFA chairman Barry Brownjohn said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It has grown from only minimal levels two years ago,&quot; Brownjohn told Reuters.</p>
<p>Investors in Australia appear more at ease with leveraged instruments now than in the early 1990s, given the advent of leveraged shares and warrants and other instruments, he said.</p>
<p>Also, in a low inflation environment, investors are looking for new avenues to maximise opportunities, he said.</p>
<p>Brownjohn linked the growth to risk-adjusted returns, which are attractive to investors along the same lines as hedge fund investments.  </p>
<p>APMFA plans to promote the Australian managed futures industry to investors domestically and aboard, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates are low, so the prospect of looking for alternative investments becomes more compelling,&quot; he said</p>
<p>A year after the Sydney Futures Exchange created a special class of membership for commodity trading advisers (CTAs), nearly a dozen have been admitted, he said.</p>
