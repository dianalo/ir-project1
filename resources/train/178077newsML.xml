<title>USA: CBOT corn ends up on export ideas, bull spreading.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn ends up on export ideas, bull spreading.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-11-08</dateline>

<p>CBOT corn futures closed higher on commercial buying and bull spreading which led to ideas that a significant amount of corn export business had been accomplished, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Commercial buying in wheat and corn kept the market up all day. There was no fresh news other than a continuation of a good technical performance,&quot; said Mark Cermak of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>Contract lows were set early this week but the market then began a reticent climb on daily charts and the cash-related buying Thursday and Friday helped fuel bullish fervor.</p>
<p>Continental Grain led the buy side with bull spreads of at least 14 million bushels Friday, traders said. Continental did five million bushels each of Dec/Mar and Mar/May and spread four million May/July, sources said. Continental also was a net buyer of two million December, they said. Cargill Inc bought eight million bushels of December and Cargill Investor Services bought 3,500 March $2.50 puts and sold 3,500 March $2.70 puts in the corn options pit, traders said.</p>
<p>Continental Thursday bull spread 10.0 million bushels.</p>
<p>Corn closed three cents per bushel higher to 1/4 lower, with December up three at $2.67-1/2.</p>
<p>Prospects for further fund short covering also helped advance the nearby corn futures contracts, the traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a weekly reversal in corn charts and they're looking for a big spec short in the corn market tonight,&quot; Cermak said.</p>
<p>Traders said the updated Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commitments of Traders report slated for release late Friday was expected to show a strong bias to the short side of corn by key funds.</p>
<p>Firm cash basis values with the Chicago market said trading at 14 cents over the December, boosted prices.</p>
<p>Traders also said short covering helped buoy corn with players taking positions ahead of Tuesday's USDA November crop production report.</p>
<p>But the Leslie-ADM Elevator survey released early Friday cast a bit of bearish light on futures. Leslie estimated the 1996 U.S. corn crop would total 9.22 billion bushels. The estimate exceeded the average of analysts' estimates in a Reuter survey of 9.145 billion bushels.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated at 69,000 contracts, below the 83,758 traded Thursday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 25,000 contracts, down from 28,542 Thursday.</p>
