<p>Germany's 30-share blue-chip DAX index ended bourse trade on Friday deep in negative territory, with traders seeking inspiration to give direction and cure the hangover from the record run of recent days.</p>
<p>The DAX index ended well off the record 3,400-point level of early in the week, and closed at 3,376.20 points, down 41.40 points, around the level of its electronic IBIS DAX colleague.</p>
<p>There was little in the way of data to allow the market to forge any significant new gains.</p>
<p>&quot;There isn't very much going on this morning and we don't expect to go back over 3,400 points while we are waiting for U.S. data this afternoon,&quot; said a Frankfurt trader.</p>
<p>The main focus of attention was on the U.S. February payrolls report due at 1330 GMT.</p>
<p>Shares in engineering group Deutz AG jumped almost 33 percent in early bourse and ended the session as the top gainer, up 2.05 marks at 10.51 marks.</p>
<p>Deutz's strong performance came after a newsletter reported that the company would return to profit in 1997.</p>
<p>Platow Brief reported that Deutz, formerly called Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG and rescued in a one billion-mark bail-out last year, would forecast a profit at its annual results conference on May 15.</p>
<p>Meanwhile shares in medical group Fresenius AG ended lower, but off earlier lows, after it denied media reports that it plans to issue bonus shares. Preference shares in Fresenius ended down seven marks at 383 marks in early trade.</p>
