<p>Egyptian share prices edged upwards on Wednesday in trading slowed by investors consolidating their gains and beginning to wind down ahead of the upcoming holiday season, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) overall index rose 1.73 points to 288.14 points on average turnover of 36.41 million pounds ($10.71 million).</p>
<p>&quot;The market is beginning to slow down ahead of the holidays. Overall prices are stabilising but some shares are still scoring,&quot; said broker Elwy Taymour of Hermes-EFG.</p>
<p>The CMA overall index hit its highest level ever in late November and has been rising steadily since.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is taking a breather but the trend is still bullish,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>An official announcement and rumours about state sell-offs in a handful of firms were behind the day's biggest trades.</p>
<p>A 6.5 million pound deal in Egypt Arab African Bank/EAAB topped the day's turnover and brokers said a state-owned bank was probably selling part of its share in the private bank to one or more investors.</p>
<p>Heliopolis Housing and Development continued to draw investors with its healthy profits and stock availability.</p>
<p>The firm announced on Monday that it had almost doubled profits in the 1995/6 financial year to 61.35 million pounds.</p>
<p>Brokers have said that the government -- which offered five or more percent of the firm to strategic investors -- was also selling some of its majority stake through the bourse.</p>
<p>The stock ended unchanged at 320 pounds after shares worth more than four million pounds were traded.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is very big and has a great net asset value. The stock is definitely undervalued,&quot; Taymour said.</p>
<p>Paints and Chemical Industries/PACHIN was also active as investors scrambled to buy shares after the state said it would sell in January part of its stake in the profitable firm via a global depository receipt offering.</p>
<p>Shares ended unchanged at 140.00 pounds.</p>
<p>Profit taking hit the popular milling sector, sending most share prices lower. Upper Egypt Flour Mills fell 0.25 pounds to 70.00 while North Cairo Flour Mills slipped 4.40 pounds to 134.10.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms rose to 435.69 points from 433.59 points on Wednesday while the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 202.01 points from 200.66.</p>
<p>Gaining shares led losers by 22 to 19.</p>
