<p>The Slovak Finance Ministry said on Thursday it would present concrete plans for revenue and expenditure for the 1997 state budget to the cabinet next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministry will present the structure of the planned revenues and expenditures of the 1997 state budget to the government on October 11,&quot; said Maria Miskivova of the ministry's budget department.</p>
<p>It is not clear when the cabinet will discuss it or when the full budget will go to parliament. But Miskivova said the material would include specific information on individual allocations for ministries and other state bodies.</p>
<p>The government has already agreed in principle that the 1997 budget deficit should be cut to a maximum 25 billion crowns from 27 billion this year. Revenue is planned at around 175 billion crowns and expenditure at 200 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The budget is based on the assumption gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at least five percent in 1997 and inflation will be kept under six percent.</p>
<p>According to this forecast, the country's GDP is expected to total 650 billion crowns in 1997.</p>
<p>In the first seven months of 1996, the budget deficit totalled 6.08 billion crowns, but government officials have said revenues might get tighter later in the year due to lower than expected tax income.</p>
<p>Slovakia has been showing some of the best basic economic indicators in post-communist Europe. Inflation was at 5.6 percent year-on-year in August, compared with 9.8 percent in the same month last year.</p>
<p>GDP grew 7.4 percent in calendar 1995 and 7.1 percent in the January-June period of this year.</p>
<p>According to preliminary plans, expenditures for debt service should total around 34 billion crowns, two billion crowns more than the planned sum for 1996.</p>
<p>Slovakia's public debt totalled 134.89 billion crowns at the end of last year, representing 26.0 percent of GDP, compared with 130.44 billion, or 29.6 percent of GDP, in 1994.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry has proposed a strategy under which the country's debt should be assessed as a proportion of GDP. &quot;This means that even if the total debt increases, the upward trend should be slower than GDP growth,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year ,the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which Slovakia wants to join, forecast the budget deficit near 1.3 percent of GDP this year, excluding debt service.</p>
