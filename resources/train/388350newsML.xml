<p>BankBoston Corp said Wednesday the Federal Reserve Board had granted it Tier 2 Section 20 powers, allowing it to underwrite corporate debt securities and some equity.</p>
<p>BankBoston said it had launched BancBoston Securities Inc (BSI), which will offer enhanced corporate financing options and investments, including underwriting and dealing in high-yield public debt securities.  </p>
<p>Vincent &quot;Val&quot; Mulcahy, president and chief operating officer of BSI, said the unit opened February 14 and began its first activity February 18.</p>
<p>He said the Fed action allows BankBoston to underwrite equity if the equity is a piece of a corporate debt financing.</p>
<p>Asked in a telephone interview if the company would seek powers to underwrite stand-alone equity, Mulcahy replied, &quot;We've taken a pretty big step taking the two tiers (of Section 20) at once. We want to be sure we can walk before we run.&quot;  </p>
<p>Tier 1 Section 20 powers cover activities such as commercial paper and revenue bonds.</p>
<p>Under the depression-era Glass-Steagall law regulating U.S. financial services, banking companies can establish subsidiaries that engage in securities dealing, provided that underwriting activities are limited to 10 percent of the gross revenues of the securities company. The ceiling will soon rise to 25 percent.</p>
<p>At present, only a small number of U.S. banks have Section 20 powers.  </p>
<p>BankBoston said its immediate plans include opening its high-yield securities business to underwrite, trade and make markets in public debt securities. The high-yield unit will be led by managing director Steven Shenfeld.</p>
<p>BankBoston said the unit will leverage BankBoston's historic client base of mostly mid-sized, non-investment-grade corporate clients.</p>
<p>The unit will underwrite senior and subordinated debt for clients in BankBoston's special industry areas such as media and communications, energy and utilities, transportation, high technology, environmental services and real estate.</p>
