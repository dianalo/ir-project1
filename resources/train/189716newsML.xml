<p>With the Dow Industrials extended on the upside, Wall Street stocks are expected to open lower after an eight-day rally.</p>
<p>Analysts said that investors would be closely watching this morning's October consumer price index, and, especially, retail sales for October.</p>
<p>&quot;We are eight for eight and the breadth figures continue to narrow. The question is can we pull it off for the ninth day. We are extended so we will start off on a lower note,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, analyst at Prudential Securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;The retail Christmas season will be the key to the stock market,&quot; Wachtel said. &quot;If the consumer comes on strongly and spends aggressively, the bond market will unravel to some degree. Good news is bad news.</p>
<p>&quot;As for today's figures, retail sales should be lower in October than they were in September. The real question is will the post-election momentum carry over into a ninth day. We'll start off slow and see if we can catch up.&quot;</p>
<p>October retail sales are expected to grow by 0.3 percent compared to 0.7 percent in September, while the core rate is expected to rise 0.3 percent compared to 0.4 percent.  </p>
<p>The October consumer price index is expected to rise 0.3 percent compared to the same increase the previous month. The core rate is expected to rise 0.2 percent compared to 0.3 percent in September.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei Average gained 52 points, or 0.25 percent, to 21,031.</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 Index was down eight at 3919.</p>
<p>Among U.S. shares traded in London, DuPont Co was down 1/2 at 92, Woolworth was up 1/2 at 24-1/2 and PepsiCo was down 3/8 at 31-5/8.</p>
<p>The long bond fell 9/32 to yield 6.47 percent.  </p>
<p>The dollar was steady against the yen in Tokyo and was in a slim range in Europe.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street writes that the stock of Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc has plummeted more than 30 percent since its shareholders agreed in late September to the purchase of Trump's Castle.</p>
<p>The New York Times Market Place writes Westinghouse Electric Corp will spin off industrial businesses to shareholders as an independent company.</p>
