<p>President Bill Clinton is closely monitoring new tobacco settlement talks to ensure that politically risky steps he took to increase federal oversight of the industry are protected, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The White House seemed intent on striking a carefully balanced position -- concerned, but not intervening -- on the disclosure that the two biggest U.S. tobacco firms are negotiating with state attorneys general and plaintiffs' lawyers on possible settlement of massive litigation by ailing smokers and anti-smoking groups.</p>
<p>A source close to the secretive talks, reported to be under way in a Washington suburb, said executives of Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and RJR Nabisco Corp.  were seeking a way to deal with lawsuits filed by at least 22 states and other plaintiffs. They seek to hold the tobacco industry liable for health problems suffered by smokers.</p>
<p>White House officials said Bruce Lindsey, a senior presidential aide and Clinton confidant, has been in periodic contact with both sides in the negotiations and has let them know the administration's views on issues under discussion.</p>
<p>&quot;We've underscored that we're interested in a certain outcome here, which is the protection of young people from the negative health effects of tobacco use,&quot; White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;We are not a party to any negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>White House support could be politically crucial, however, especially if legislation were required to enforce whatever agreement might emerge concerning out-of-court settlements.</p>
<p>The parties are said to be discussing the establishment of a $300 billion fund to pay for smoking-related illnesses over a 25-year period.</p>
<p>Clinton last year gave broad powers to the federal Food and Drug Administration by approving its contention that nicotine is a drug. That position underpins FDA's effort to regulate the industry and limit advertising it considers to be aimed at persuading young people to smoke.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry is fighting that regulatory effort in court and one White House concern would appear to be any negotiated deal that might undermine prospective FDA powers.</p>
<p>McCurry said the White House has been monitoring &quot;the conversations that have been underway with an eye towards protecting the very important public health objectives ... that have been set by the FDA.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, which broke the story, the industry negotiators were considering dropping their legal challenge to the FDA's authority.</p>
<p>Clinton embraced a tough campaign against cigarette smoking despite concerns it could hurt his re-election chances last year in several tobacco-growing southern states.</p>
<p>&quot;This is something the president feels strongly about,&quot; a White House official said. &quot;Obviously he's not going to back down now.&quot;</p>
<p>Only Tuesday, on a trip to New York, Clinton visited a junior high school in Brooklyn and delivered a strong anti-smoking message.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sort of the country's public advocate,&quot; he declared at a &quot;Kick Butt&quot; rally. He said that &quot;tobacco companies are getting more clever now&quot; in pitching advertising at the young.</p>
<p>Word of the talks stirred cautious and somewhat sceptical reaction in Congress, with Democratic Sens. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Ron Wyden of Oregon expressing reservations in a letter to Clinton.</p>
<p>Letter urged Clinton to &quot;maintain a healthy scepticism&quot; toward any proposed settlement. It said: &quot;We are on the cusp of victory and should not allow the tobacco industry to use a global settlement to turn the tide against necessary protections to the public health...&quot;</p>
