<p>Three men died and half a million dollars in cash was sprayed across a Guatemalan ranch when a small airplane used to transport bank deposits slammed into the side of a nearby canyon, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The single-engine Cessna 206 was on a routine flight to Guatemala City on Wednesday when it crashed in the canyon near Taxisco, 30 miles (50 kms) south of the capital, killing the pilot and two passengers, Guatemala's Civil Aviation Chief of Operations, Rony Paz, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;You can imagine the impact of a plane going down. The money was sprayed all over the place,&quot; Paz said.</p>
<p>The plane, owned by Transportes Aereos Guatemaltecos, had left its planned route because of bad weather, Paz said.</p>
<p>The two passengers were employees of Proteccion de Valores, S.A., a company that specialises in moving cash and deposits from bank branches in the south of the country to central branches in the capital.</p>
<p>&quot;We have information that a large percent of the money was recovered, we're talking about 3.2 million quetzales ($533,333),&quot; Luis Orellana, the company's business manager, told Reuters.</p>
