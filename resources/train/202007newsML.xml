<p>Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, his political life at stake after allegations he had sex with under-age boys, testifed on Wednesday to a parliament commission probing the charges, RTBF television said.</p>
<p>Di Rupo, a discreet homosexual, hotly denies the charges, insisting that he only ever had sex with consenting adults.</p>
<p>The commission has to decide whether the evidence is strong enough to warrant recommending to the full Belgian parliament that Di Rupo's immunity from prosecution be lifted and that he be sent before the Cour de Cassation, the country's highest court.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do not come to a solution tonight we will have to reconvene tomorrow, but...it would be in the country's interest to reach a solution as soon as possible,&quot; commission member Serge Moureaux told reporters shortly before Di Rupo arrived to testify to the closed-door meeting.</p>
<p>The allegations, following an unrelated paedophile sex and murder scandal that has shaken Belgium for the past three months, has further eroded already weak public confidence in the political and judicial system and shaken the government.</p>
<p>A telephone poll of 1,000 people by La Derniere Heure newspaper showed 49 percent thought Di Rupo should quit immediately against 42 percent who believed it was not necessary. Di Rupo has made it clear he will fight to the end.</p>
<p>Members of the commission have said the case against Di Rupo is thin.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking into the possibility of letting Mr Di Rupo be heard by the court without going through the heavy procedure (of lifting his constitutional immunity),&quot; commission member Albert Gehlen earlier told reporters in parliament.</p>
<p>BRTN radio said the Brussels public prosecutor had asked the commission to take this course.</p>
<p>Gehlen is a member of the PSC, the francophone Christian Democratic party which is one of the four parties in Belgium's centre left coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;The allegations against Di Rupo are very thin and do not seem well-founded,&quot; federal Science Minister Ivan Ylieff, a francophone Socialist like Di Rupo, told reporters.</p>
<p>Ylieff, who is not a member of the commission, was later publicly told by Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to keep his opinions to himself.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is not a crime in Belgium. Sex with children younger than 16 is.</p>
<p>The Belgian daily De Morgen quoted the two Flemish socialist members of the commission as saying the allegations against Di Rupo were not very substantial.</p>
<p>Several Belgian papers said the 29-page report contained detailed allegations against Di Rupo dating back to the late 1980s from a man, arrested in connection with a child porn video case, who was 15 at the time.</p>
<p>The commission's procedure is similar to that which brought down Belgian NATO Secretary General Willy Claes last year.</p>
<p>Parliament referred him to the Cour de Cassation over allegations of bribery in an army contract in the late 1980s. He has still not been tried.</p>
<p>A date for a parliamentary vote on the commission's recommendation has not yet been set. A simple majority of the 150-seat house is needed to implement the commission's advice.</p>
<p>Parliament has three options when it comes to a vote.</p>
<p>It can adopt the prosecutor's request and bring Di Rupo before the Cour de Cassation, a move which would immediately end his political career. Parliament can also reject the court's request, which is unlikely.</p>
<p>But political sources said that the commission was increasingly looking at allowing the court to hear Di Rupo, but without lifting his immunity.</p>
