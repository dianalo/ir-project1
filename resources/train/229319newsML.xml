<p>Syria expects to export around 125,000 tonnes of ginned cotton from this year's harvest after meeting the needs of the local market, Ahmed Suhad Jubara, chief of the state-owned cotton marketing organisation (CMO), said on Monday.</p>
<p>He told Reuters production reached a record 725,000 tonnes this year, and that the CMO, the sole marketer of cotton in Syria, had bought 712,000 tonnes from farmers during the past seven weeks.</p>
<p>The rest would be bought in the next two days.</p>
<p>Syria produced around 650,000 tonnes of raw cotton in 1995, and average output between 1991 and 1995 was around 604,000 tonnes, Jubara said.</p>
<p>It had made great strides this year in boosting yields, which had reached a record 3.4 tonnes per hectare, compared with 3.1 tonnes in 1995 and only 1.6 tonnes in 1970.</p>
<p>This had allowed a decline in the area devoted to cotton to 216,581 hectares from 236,133 in 1970, freeing up land for other strategic products, especially wheat.</p>
<p>Syria's main markets for ginned cotton were Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Russia, China and Poland.</p>
<p>Cotton was also exported to Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>&quot;The success of our external marketing policy is based on our respect of contracts and accuracy in dates of delivery and keeping the high quality of our products,&quot; the GEGMC chief said.</p>
<p>He said Syrian cotton also attracted strong demand because it was still harvested by hand.</p>
<p>More than 20 percent of Syria's population was involved in the cotton industry and affiliated sectors.</p>
<p>Syrian industry minister Ahmed Nezamuldin told Reuters last week the government and the private sector were investing around $1.27 billion to boost the cotton industry and to build new mills.</p>
<p>Nezamuldin said the ministry was working to reduce the sale of ginned cotton and expand exports of spun cotton. The difference in price could be as high as $7,000 per tonne for some grades.</p>
