<p>A South African consortium of Firstcorp Capital and Defy management confirmed on Wednesday it had bought Malbak-controlled white goods manufacturer Defy.</p>
<p>The firm gave no indication of price but Business Day newspaper reported earlier that the price-tag was 179 million rand, pipping Sweden's Electrolux, which placed a bid of between 200 and 300 million rand.</p>
<p>Defy chief executive officer Ross Heron said management's knowledge of the business could have contributed to the succesful joint bid.</p>
<p>Defy has an annual turnover exceeding 700 million rand and a workforce of 2,400. It holds about 32 percent of South Africa's market share.</p>
<p>&quot;We are excited about market growth prospects in view of the intensive electrification programme and housing development within the country,&quot; Heron said.</p>
<p>The disposals by Malbak of its unlisted subsidiaries form part of the group's decision to unbundle its assets in a bid to unlock the value of its underlying investments.</p>
