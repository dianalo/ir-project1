<p>* Mercury Finance hired an outside corporate turnaround specialist, William Brandt, to help it avoid bankruptcy.</p>

<p>* Reports from the Commerce Department, which said construction spending fell and personal incomes outpaced spending in December, and data showing a January slowdown in manufacturing, could mean the Fed will not feel compelled to raise interest rates when it meets this week.</p>
<p>* Signs of slower growth gave a boost to the Treasury market, where the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.73 percent.</p>
<p>* AT&amp;T Chief Financial Officer Richard Miller resigned unexpectedly.</p>
<p>* Guan Jinsheng, the central figure in a scandal involving Shanghai's leading securities firm, was sentenced to 17 years in prison.</p>

<p>* The future of Venezuelan airline Viasa depends on how its employees vote on a $55 million plan by the Venezuelan government and Spain's Iberia Air Lines to rescue it from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>* A company owned 80 percent by America Online has bought WP Studio, the producer of an online guide to New York City.</p>
<p>* Computer Associates Chairman Charles Wang's competitiveness and adaptability serves him well both in the board room and on the basketball court.</p>
<p>* A deepening trade deficit, a weakening currency and soaring wages indicate that economic growth could be slowing in South Korea, the world's 11th-largest economy.</p>
