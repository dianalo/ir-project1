<p>Venezuela's drive for oil production growth will continue to add around six percent a year to current capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) and the country's conflict with OPEC on quota-busting will be eased as world demand grows, the head of state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PdVSA), Luis Giusti, argues.</p>
<p>&quot;Even in the low-case scenario you see demand on OPEC growing through the year 2005 to 37 million barrels per day,&quot; said Giusti in an interview.</p>
<p>But if demand growth doesn't accomodate Venezuelan production growth in the meantime? &quot;We'll get it,&quot; is all Giusti will say.</p>
<p>The overproduction issue was ducked at this week's OPEC meeting, which ended Thursday with agreement to hold the official production ceiling at 25.033 million bpd for another six months.</p>
<p>Strong demand this year kept the meeting short and uncontentious and accusations that Venezuela is producing at a rate some 700,000 bpd over its 2.359 million bpd quota were muted.</p>
<p>In line with his oil minister, Erwin Arrieta, Giusti says the quota-busting charge is overstated.</p>
<p>&quot;The effective capacity to deliver the barrel is about 2.8 million (bpd)&quot; after deducting &quot;low-and-off&quot; wastage and accounting for maintenance and so on. Domestic consumption, which Venezuela argues should be deducted from the quota, accounts for just under 400,000 bpd.</p>
<p>But Giusti said PdVSA's main focus is on attracting the foreign investment necessary to grow production capacity by at least 150,000 bpd to 180,000 bpd a year.</p>
<p>The latest leg of PdVSA's expansion plan wraps up in London on Friday with a presentation to potential investors in 15 so-called marginal fields, the third licensing round for foreign oil investment.</p>
<p>Oil companies have until December 20th to submit bids and PdVSA will select winners and sign contracts in May, 1997.</p>
<p>Giusti says the 20 marginal fields up for grabs have current production of about 150,000 bpd. &quot;The build-up will take that to anything from between 450,000 bpd and 500,000 bpd. The companies that win will have to devise a development programme that should have a minimum activity level pre-established. It is estimated that the first three years' investment will be around $700 million but the full range in the 20-year period will be between $5 and $6 billion.&quot;</p>
<p>Previous marginal field developments, such as Jusepin and Nodosaria, have exceeded expectations. But some oil companies have expressed concern that unresolved tax issues might discourage investment.</p>
<p>Last week, Amoco Corp president William Lowrie said in Caracas said these &quot;serious issues&quot; need to be resolved.</p>
<p>Giusti said the hold up on oil companies' exemption from paying 16.5 pct value-added tax on start-up costs, &quot;is about to be resolved. I would say it is a matter of days. The law is in place already it is only a matter of how you apply it.&quot;</p>
<p>Other outstanding issues, such as allowing companies to account in dollars and worries about arbitrary municipal taxes, also have been agreed by all parties but are held up by bureaucratic delays, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PdVSA's expansion plans downstream are expected to move at a pace ahead of production growth and a number of potential U.S. refinery acquisitions are under consideration, though none are imminent, Giusti said.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally, we start getting into positions in the market ahead of our volume. We are looking at options (to buy refinery assets) and might end up doing something else,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sun has been putting forward some proposals but that is far away from reaching a deal,&quot; Giusti said, referring to ailing U.S. refiner Sun Co  SUN.N. Other preliminary discussions include Phillips Petroleum Co's 205,000 bpd Sweeney, Texas plant and Unocal's remaining stake in the 153,00 bpd Lemont, Ill. plant.</p>
