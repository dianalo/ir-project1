<p>Bulgarian riot police put an end to an opposition siege of parliament early on Saturday, firing blank cartridges and using clubs to beat a path for trapped deputies from the ruling Socialist party.</p>
<p>Police cleared a path to buses parked outside the darkened parliament building, and deputies left under a hail of stones thrown by opposition protesters.</p>
<p>They then turned their clubs on protesters who had been keeping vigil outside after attacking parliament on Friday in Bulgaria's worst political violence since the overthrow of one-party rule in 1989.</p>
<p>Police told deputies to lie down in the buses as they moved off, their windows smashed by stones.</p>
<p>Deputies of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces remained in the building. They have sworn to stay until their demand for a general election is met.</p>
<p>Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev said he would not ask the ex-communist ruling party to form a new government on Saturday as expected because of the protests.</p>
<p>&quot;Under these conditions, tomorrow I will not give a mandate for formation of a new government,&quot; Zhelev, who is normally a figurehead and has less than two weeks left in office, said on national television after visiting parliament.</p>
<p>He said he sympathised with the protesters but could not condone violence. &quot;I back the protests of the people who have been driven to this humiliating state. In this way they are demonstrating their dignity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zhelev had been expected on Saturday to summon Interior Minister Nikolai Dobrev, the Socialists' nominee for prime minister, to give him a mandate to form a new government.</p>
<p>Dobrev met president-elect Petar Stoyanov in parliament and Stoyanov said they had agreed to hold all-party talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We both share the same opinion, that the most important is the interests of Bulgaria and talks between the political forces should start,&quot; Stoyanov said.</p>
<p>The demonstration started with a human chain of students around parliament. Protesters tried to attack former Socialist interior minister Lyubomir Nachev as he left the building.</p>
<p>Opposition deputies walked out after the Socialists refused to vote on a motion calling for early elections. The vote took place as clouds of teargas billowed into the building.</p>
<p>The demonstrators broke windows in the parliament and smashed and overturned cars which deputies had parked outside.</p>
<p>Some security forces chatted to protesters and expressed sympathy for their cause. &quot;We are part of these people but I have to follow orders,&quot; said one policeman inside parliament.</p>
<p>Ivan Kostov, leader of the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces, called for a general strike and campaign of civil disobedience.</p>
<p>&quot;After this clash and this lack of understanding, we believe there is no possibility for us to stay and keep on working in this parliament,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Stoyanov -- an opposition figure whose election two months ago marked the collapse of public support for the Socialists -- was overcome by teargas while trying to calm the crowds through a loudspeaker. He was taken away by bodyguards.</p>
<p>Some 25 injured demonstrators and four police were treated in hospital.</p>
<p>Voters delivered a powerful no-confidence vote to the Socialist government two months ago by electing Stoyanov as president with 60 percent of votes.</p>
<p>Liquidity problems among the country's poorly supervised banks last year led to 14 being placed in receivership. A flight into dollars has pushed the lev from 70 to the dollar to 645 in a year. Annual inflation for 1996 hit 310.8 percent, the second largest rise since Bulgaria began market reform in 1990.</p>
<p>As soon as parliament approves a new cabinet the International Monetary Fund plans to negotiate implementation of a tough fixed exchange regime as a last resort to restore confidence in the crumbling economy.</p>
