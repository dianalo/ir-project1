<p>Brazil's Banco Noroeste on Monday said its first-half earnings rose to 42.8 million reais from 29 million reais in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Jayme Marques de Souza, market relations director at the bank, said Noroeste's performance mostly reflected an increase in its client base, higher revenues from credit operations, and banking and asset management fees.</p>
<p>Souza said the bank, which will publish its complete first-half results in coming days, gained 32,000 clients in the first half. It opened two new branches a month, taking its network to 97 branches.  </p>
<p>The bank's credit portfolio rose 22.7 percent to 2.2 billion reais in the first half, he said.</p>
<p>Noroeste's revenues from banking and investment fund management fees totalled 66 million reais in the first half, he added.</p>
<p>Noroeste has pre-qualified for Thursday's privatization auction of Minas Gerais state bank Credireal, but Souza said the bank has not yet decided whether it will participate in the auction. &quot;Our focus is on the southeast region and we have a few branches in Minas Gerais state. But we still don't know if we will bid,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Souza also dismissed persistent market speculation that Noroeste will be sold to Spain's Banco Santander.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all speculation. The bank's controlling shareholders have not decided if the bank will have new majority or minority partners,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Noroeste has repeatedly denied rumors that it is about to sell a controlling stake to Santander, which late March acquired a 51 percent stake in Brazil's Banco Geral do Comercio.</p>
<p>He said many foreign banks have sought deals with Noroeste after it ended a partnership with Chemical Bank of the United States because of Chemical's merger with Chase Manhattan Corp last year.</p>
<p>Controlled by the Cochrane family, Noroeste is a medium-sized bank, focusing on retail investors and small and medium-sized corporate clients.</p>
