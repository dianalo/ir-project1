<p>World insurance premiums have broken through the $2,000 billion mark for the first time, but while Asia is booming, growth in Europe and America has fallen off, according to reinsurers Swiss Re.</p>
<p>In its latest Sigma research report, Swiss Re said insurance premium volume in 1995 was $2,143.4 billion, an increase of 3.7 per cent on the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;This indicated growth which, like the previous year, was below the long term average of 4.6 per cent&quot;, the report said.</p>
<p>In a sluggish year, non life insurance achieved a turnover of $906.8 billion, up 2.2 per cent, mostly from Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>Life insurance counted for $1,236.6 billion, up 5.3 per cent, reaching highs in Japan and South Korea, South Africa and Switzerland.</p>
<p>In the U.S., falling prices in non-life insurance led to weak growth, while in life insurance below average to negative growth was recorded for individual products.</p>
<p>Non-life insurance in Europe suffered from &quot;lack of demand arising from the poor climate and price competition due to increasing deregulation in the European Union&quot;, the report said.</p>
<p>Real drops in premium income were recorded in 7 countries, with the UK holding the negative record with -5.5 per cent because of heavily falling prices following years of good results.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth in life business has also fallen in Europe. This might be an indication of the increasing significance of private pension schemes in economically difficult times,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe also suffered negative development in 1995, due primarily to trends in the Russian market.</p>
<p>&quot;The virtual tripling of nominal premium income was insufficient to keep pace with hyperinflation,&quot; Swiss Re said.</p>
<p>But Asia had the most dynamic markets, bolstered by a powerful upturn in the region's economy.</p>
<p>&quot;South East Asia has once again revealed itself as a growth region par excellence: growth rates in most countries achieved double figures in non life insurance (13.3 per cent) and in life insurance (17.5 per cent),&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>In addition Japan recovered from the weak growth of the previous year to 'normal' growth rates in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important reason for this may include the attractiveness of savings-linked products. The lines occupational injury and liability recorded the greatest growth; the latter due to poor product liability legislation.&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The Japanese also spent most on insurance, spending $5,088 per inhabitant. The Swiss were in second place with $4,507.</p>
