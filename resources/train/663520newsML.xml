<title>USA: No impact on flight attendants case from smoke talks.</title>

<p>The Florida judge hearing a class action suit brought by flight attendants against the tobacco industry said Monday he did not expect talks between cigarette makers and state attorneys general to affect the trial.</p>
<p>Dade County Circuit Judge Robert Kaye made his comments after a motion by Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt, attorneys for the plaintiffs in the case, that he issue an order that a settlement between government officials and tobacco companies not affect the class action suit, known as Norma Broin vs. Philip Morris Cos. Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't intend to do anything yet with this because there isn't anything to do (yet). We will proceed as we are proceeding,&quot; Kaye said.</p>
<p>He did not rule on the motion but indicated that he did not feel that the talks would affect the trial, currently in its eighth day of jury selection.</p>
<p>Bargaining between tobacco companies and state attorneys general toward a sweeping industry settlement was expected to resume in Washington Monday. Sources have said the talks could lead to an agreement as early as this week.</p>
<p>Kaye also said there could be constitutional problems with using a settlement agreement such as the tobacco pact being discussed to bar others from going to court.</p>
<p>Tobacco industry attorneys responded that the motion was an attempt by the Rosenblatts to gain attention in the media. Tobacco lawyers have repeatedly asked the judge to limit publicity about the case.</p>
<p>In the Broin case, the Rosenblatts represent a nationwide class of about 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants seeking as much as $5 billion in damages from tobacco firms for illnesses they attribute to breathing secondhand cigarette smoke on U.S.-based passenger jets.</p>
