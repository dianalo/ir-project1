<title>USA: COMEX copper ends at seven week lows.</title>
<headline>COMEX copper ends at seven week lows.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX copper futures fell sharply to end at seven week lows Wednesday, led down by LME copper which also fell to seven week lows.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no news behind it, just supply overwhelming demand and a break of key support around 88 cents on decent volume in December copper which caught many people asleep,&quot; Triland USA trader Brent Tolen said.</p>
<p>COMEX December fell 2.85 cents to 87.15 a lb after hitting a session low at 87.00, its lowest level since July 22.</p>
<p>The December/March backwardation narrowed further to 1.10 cents, from 1.50 cents at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The wide backwardation of recent weeks looks to have attracted copper supplies to exchange inventories recently, easing the prompt tightness, analysts said.</p>
<p>COMEX copper warehouse stocks have risen steadily to over 20,000 short tons from less than 5,000 short tons in June.</p>
<p>In the past few days both COMEX and LME copper prices had been consolidating near the bottom of the range of the past two months, after swinging in a wide range last week, partly on options related trade as short positions, established during the Sumitomo affair earlier this year, were unwound.  </p>
<p>&quot;Prices are susceptible to a technical selloff,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;But a number of U.S. producers continue to buy copper in the spot market to meet sales commitments which could moderate the extent of any price decline.&quot;</p>
