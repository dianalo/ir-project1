<p>The influential army, at the centre of a row with the government over Islamist activism, said on Thursday it was steering clear of Turkey's turbulent party politics.</p>
<p>&quot;The Turkish armed forces does not cooperate or favour any personality, political party or group,&quot; the military said in a statement carried by the state-run Anatolian news agency.</p>
<p>The military was reacting to a story in the Sabah newspaper that said the generals wanted Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to win a struggle for the leadership of the Turkish right to ward off the rise of Islamist politicians.</p>
<p>The secularist army has raised its political profile in recent months with a demand that Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan crack down on Islamist activity.</p>
<p>Two ministers from Ciller's True Path Party who sympathise with the army resigned last weekend.</p>
<p>Talks between opposition leaders to form a shadow government that would oust Erbakan have so far borne little fruit and main opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz has indicated it was too early for fresh elections.</p>
<p>Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, had earlier said he was prepared for early polls if necessary.</p>
<p>The military has given Erbakan a list of 18 anti-Islamist measures it wants carried out, including restrictions on Islamist education and enforcement of a ban on Islamic dress.</p>
<p>An Islamist MP close to Erbakan denied he would resign in frustration at Erbakan's reluctance to heed the army.</p>
