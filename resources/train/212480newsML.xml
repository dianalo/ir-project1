<title>USA: SEC eases provisions of new order-handling rules.</title>
<headline>SEC eases provisions of new order-handling rules.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-11-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it was easing deadlines and certain other provisions of new stock order-handling rules that are scheduled to be in force by January 10.</p>
<p>The action was in response to reactions to the rules, adopted in August, the agency said.</p>
<p>In general, the rules call for a wider display of limit orders -- those in which a customer wants to buy or sell a stock at a specific price and not at the prevailing market price.</p>
<p>The rules also call for giving investors a chance to view all limit order prices posted on private electronic trading screens that otherwise would not be readily available to them.</p>
<p>While the SEC adopted the rules as final, however, it still sought comments, particularly from exchanges and broker-dealers on whether certain changes may be needed.</p>
<p>To allay concerns raised about the new rules, including the limited time within which technological changes are to be put in place, the SEC said it issued an &quot;interpretive guidance&quot; to the exchanges.</p>
<p>Among the provisions the agency eased was one calling for market makers and exchange specialists to display a limit order within 30 seconds of being received.</p>
<p>Also, the SEC said it will not bring any enforcement action against a market maker or specialist if, for technical reasons, they are not able to comply with the 30-second display requirement.</p>
<p>The SEC said the no-action position will be effective until April 10, 1997.</p>
<p>The SEC also said that, until July 31, it will take no action against market makers or specialists if they fail to include in their public quotes the price of any better-priced order they have placed on a private electronic communications network, or ECN.</p>
<p>The SEC also eased the requirement that Nasdaq begin displaying limit orders on 1,000 of its most actively traded securities by January 10.</p>
<p>Instead, the agency will require only 50 of the 1,000 to be displayed by that date. An additional 100 securities must be displayed by January 31 and the remaining 850 by February 21, it said.</p>
