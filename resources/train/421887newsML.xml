<p>The Telecommunications Council is expected to agree on Thursday a directive to cover basic voice telephone service in an era of free competition.</p>
<p>The Council, racing against the EU's January 1, 1998, deadline for liberalising telecoms markets, is also set to finalise a directive setting out a regime for authorising phone companies to operate once state monopolies are abolished.</p>
<p>They will also discuss ways to ensure that EU governments implement the legislation needed to enforce that deadline, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The voice telephone measure, COM(96)419, would update directive 96/62/EC on application of &quot;Open Network Provision&quot; principles to voice telephony.</p>
<p>The legislation aims to ensure that customers -- either consumers or competing phone companies -- receive efficient and non-discriminatory service.</p>
<p>It covers issues such as network access, contracts, tariffs and billing and sets out a range of services that must be offered to all residents at an affordable price, with help from a special &quot;universal service&quot; fund if needed.</p>
<p>The services include phone lines that can handle calls, faxes and data communications; directories, directory services, public pay phones and emergency services.</p>
<p>One of the main controversies for EU governments was whether mobile phone companies should be covered by the new rules, diplomats said. Some countries with more liberalised telecoms markets, such as Sweden and Finland, did not want to burden the sector with heavy regulation.</p>
<p>Ministers are expected to agree to require mobile operators to follow only certain provisions -- those covering directory services, operator assistance, emergency services, contracts and publication of consumer information, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The legislation would update existing rules by applying some provisions to companies with &quot;significant market share&quot; -- generally at least 25 percent of a country's voice phone market -- rather than to those granted &quot;special or exclusive&quot; rights.</p>
<p>The ministers are also expected to formally adopt a directive, COM(95)545, requiring governments to use open and objective procedures for authorising telecoms operators and establishing a &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; system for those wanting to operate in more than one EU state.</p>
<p>The legislation -- approved last month by the European Parliament on a second reading with six amendments that were accepted by the Council -- encourages EU states to use &quot;general authorisation&quot; schemes requiring no prior approval.</p>
<p>But they may require individual licences for providers of voice telephone services or public telecoms networks or to allocate radio frequencies or numbers, grant access to land or impose public service obligations.</p>
<p>The Council may also adopt as an &quot;A&quot; (non-discussion) point a draft decision, COM(95)529, to increase European coordination in selecting and licensing providers of satellite personal communications systems.</p>
