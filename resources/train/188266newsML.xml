<p>CSCE coffee futures ended mostly higher Thursday, led by a sharp advance in the spot December contract amid persistent near-term supply concerns, market sources said.</p>
<p>Expectations of a drawdown in monthly consumer stocks touched off a late wave of buying by locals, dealers said, with most of the interest concentrated on the nearby month.</p>
<p>Green Coffee Association stock figures for October, due out after the close of business on Friday, are expected to show a decline of between 200,000 and 300,000 60-kg bags.</p>
<p>In September, supplies of green coffee in U.S. warehouses fell to 1,611,000 bags, their lowest level since the GCA began tracking inventories eight years ago.</p>
<p>With prompt supplies still relatively scarce, market participants once again scrambled to hedge the risk of another sharp drawdown in consumer stocks, traders said. The volatile nearby switch has contracted sharply in recent weeks, he noted, after peaking earlier this month at a high of 15 cents.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the December/March spread jumped to 9.20 cents, up from 7.15 cents at yesterday's close.</p>
<p>December futures rose 3.10 cents a lb on the day, to 121.60. Most-active March ended 1.05 cents higher, at 112.40, after ranging narrowly from 111.00 to 112.80. The remaining months finished 0.55 firmer to 0.40 weaker.</p>
<p>In other news, the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered its estimates for Colombia's coffee production for the current and upcoming marketing years, citing unfavourable weather conditions.</p>
<p>The USDA assessed 1995/96 output at 12 million 60-kg bags, down from 12.5 million. It also lowered the forecast for the 1996/97 campaign to 12.5 million, from 13 million.</p>
<p>The day's volume reached an estimated 6,508 lots.</p>
