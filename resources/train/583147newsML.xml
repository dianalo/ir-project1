<p>Mother Teresa is planning to go abroad on a tour that will include meeting Pope John Paul, but her fragile health after a serious illness last year may interfer, a spokeswoman for her Missionaries of Charity said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The trip could include Rome, Poland, the United States and China, the spokewoman said.</p>
<p>But doctor Patricia Aubanel, who will accompany her, said the trip hinged on the 86-year-old Roman Catholic nun's health.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever her programme is, it will ultimately depend on her health condition,&quot; Aubanel told Reuters.</p>
<p>She said the gentle nun, known as the Saint of the Gutters for her devotion to the poor and dying, was scheduled to leave Calcutta for Rome via New Delhi on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;If she feels well after her air journey from Calcutta to Delhi, she will fly to Rome on Thursday night,&quot; Aubanel said.</p>
<p>&quot;But if she feels unwell after her flight to Delhi, she will have to cancel her trip to Europe and the United States and take rest in Delhi for two days before returning here.&quot;</p>
<p>Aubanel, who was part of the team that carried out the nun's three heart operations in 1991, 1993 and 1996, said she had advised Mother Teresa to visit only Rome.</p>
<p>&quot;She is much, much better now. But with her present health condition, she should not visit any other place, other than Rome,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>This will be Mother Teresa's first foreign trip since she stepped down as head of her religious order in March after being admitted to hospital three times last year for emergency care and heart surgery.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman for her Calcutta-based Missionaries of Charity order said: &quot;Mother wants to visit Poland, Rome, the United States and if possible China.</p>
<p>&quot;She is looking for an opportunity to visit China. If she gets one, she will visit China before returning to India,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the Nobel Peace laureate was due to return by the first week of August, adding that no date had been fixed for her meeting with the Pope.</p>
<p>&quot;She will definitely meet the Pope, but the time would be decided considering the schedules of the two,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's few tours outside India have been marred by ill health.</p>
<p>On a visit to Europe in 1993, she injured three ribs in a fall. On a trip to the United States in 1991, she fell ill midway through the visit and had to undergo the first of her three heart operations.</p>
