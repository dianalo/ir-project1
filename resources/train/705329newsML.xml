<p>Ireland's adjusted annual private sector credit growth was 18.9 percent in May against 19 percent in April, the central bank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>End-month banking statistics showed that broad money supply (M3E) rose to 18.7 percent from 17.3 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Following two months of very strong private sector credit growth, the increase in May was in line with that of a year earlier resulting in a broadly unchanged annual rate of increase,&quot; the bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said the annual rate of growth of non-mortgage Irish pound credit rose by 21.1 percent in May against 22 percent in April while residential mortgage lending increased by 14.4 percent in the year to May against 14.3 percent in April.</p>
<p>Overall private sector credit was up by 579 million in May, an increase of 1.5 percent compared with a 1.6 percent increase in May 1996.</p>
<p>Irish pound lending rose by 513 million with term and revolving loans accounting for almost half of the increase in Irish-pound credit.</p>
<p>The other major contributor was mortgage lending which increased by 183 million of which 141 million was residential mortgages.</p>
<p>The bank said instalment credit and hire-purchase lending increased by 22 million, a relatively strong increase for the third month in a row.</p>
