<p>Deutsche Telekom AG, set to launch Europe's largest-ever stock offering next month, could offer shares to investors in a range between 25 marks and 30 marks, according to German press reports on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Handelsblatt newspaper, Germany's leading economic daily, said the Helaba Trust, one of the managing banks in Telekom's share listing, considered this price range to be appropriate.</p>
<p>&quot;The Telekom share represents an interesting investment opportunity for long-term and risk-conscious investors,&quot; the paper quoted the bank as saying in its report.</p>
<p>Telekom will release its preliminary sales prospectus on Friday for its share listing in Germany and New York on November 18. The listing is expected to have a volume of some 15 billion marks.</p>
<p>Boersen-Zeitung, the widely read financial daily, said a studies by Sachsen LB and Hauck Bankiers expected Telekom to offer shares to investors during its bookbuilding procedure in a range of 22 marks to 29 marks.</p>
<p>This would make an initial public offering subscription price of 25 marks an &quot;appropriate compromise&quot;, the paper said.</p>
<p>Sachsen LB expects Telekom's earnings per share according to the German Financical Analysts method (DVFA), the most widely accepted accounting method in Germany, to plunge to 1.07 marks this year from 2.64 marks in 1995. But it should begin rising again, reaching 1.95 marks next year.</p>
<p>Helaba predicts that Telekom's EPS will rise to more than two marks next year, to 2.70 marks in 1998 and over 3.30 by the year 2000.</p>
<p>The Handelsblatt, citing anonymous sources from Telekom's managing banks, said the company had an estimated book value of between 50 billion and 70 billion marks.</p>
<p>While the banks appear confident that Telekom will succeed in quickly shaving its enormous debt burden, they said there were other risks that could affect the performance of Telekom's share after its IPO.</p>
<p>The main factors that could affect the company are competition after 1998, a heightened regulatory environment, and disappointment in the company's 1996 earnings, which are expected to fall sharply from the previous year.</p>
