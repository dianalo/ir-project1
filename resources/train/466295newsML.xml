<headline>Pa. Senate sets hearings on liquor store sales.</headline>
<text>
<p>HARRISBURG, Pa., March 25 - The Pennsylvania Senate's Law and Justice Committee said Tuesday it scheduled hearings for next month to discuss Gov. Tom Ridge's plan to sell state liquor stores.</p>
<p>The committee, chaired by Sen. David Heckler, said hearings will be held April 1 and 2. Ridge has said the move could generate as much as $605 million over 10 years for the state.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very high-priority proposal for the Ridge Administration, and it is important for legislators and the public to fully understand the details of the plan and the potential effects that privatization could have on the sale and regulation of wine and spirits in Pennsylvania,&quot; Heckler said.</p>
<p>Among those scheduled to testify are Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board Chairman John Jones; representatives of Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm that developed revenue projections for the potential sale; union officials; Mothers Against Drunk Driving; and the Pennsylvania State Police.</p>
<p>Under Ridge's proposal, Pennsylvania would no longer control the retail sale of wine and liquor.</p>
<p>A maximum of 757 stand-alone franchises would be sold, with restrictions on monopoly control.</p>
<p>The proceeds from the sale of the stores would be used to fund enhanced alcohol education and enforcement efforts, assist displaced state store workers, fund the development of community assets, and provide college scholarships for students.</p>
