<p>A new history channel will begin broadcasting in France on the symbolic date of July 14, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille during the French revolution, the channel's backers told a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>The channel, Histoire, is majority-owned by public French television groups France Television and La Sept-Arte, which each have 25 percent.</p>
<p>France Telecom, Lyonnaise des Eaux's Lyonnaise Communication, and the broadcasting archives body Institut National de l'Audiovisuel have 10 percent each, and investment fund Archimedia holds the remaining 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This channel will succeed if it has talent,&quot; said Gerard Worms, a banker at Rothschild et Cie and chairman of Histoire.</p>
<p>Histoire will be broadcast on France's cable television networks and on one of France's three digital satellite TV services, Television par Satellite (TPS). Most of its backers are also shareholders in TPS.</p>
<p>The new channel's 1998 budget has been set at 38 million francs ($6.4 million), of which 25.5 million will go on programme purchasing and production. Breakeven should be reached in the year 2001, Worms said.</p>
<p>Programmes will run during the afternoon and evening, the backers said. WEM/SLA ($ = 5.959 French Francs)</p>
