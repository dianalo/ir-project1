<title>USA: FDA panel rejects heart laser device.</title>
<headline>FDA panel rejects heart laser device.</headline>
<dateline>GAITHERSBURG, Md.</dateline>
<text>
<p>A federal Food and Drug Administration panel Monday voted 9-2 to reject a proposed treatment for end-stage heart disease in which a laser is used to punch holes in the heart wall.</p>
<p>PLC Systems Inc.'s laser system is designed to treat chronic chest pain sufferers who do not respond to angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.</p>
<p>FDA panellists said PLC presented incomplete trial data and also had little understanding of exactly how the heart laser procedure, known as Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR), restores blood flow to damaged heart tissue.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect there is a use for this device, but the data is woefully incomplete,&quot; said panellist Dr. Samuel Cascells of the University of Texas Health Science Centre.</p>
<p>The FDA is not bound by its panels' advice but usually follows it.</p>
<p>During a daylong meeting to consider the device, FDA reviewers criticised PLC's data, saying the positive results might be due to a placebo effect and that more deaths resulted with TMR than without it.</p>
<p>FDA panellist Cynthia Tracy of Georgetown University said she was worried about high numbers of sudden deaths and irregular heartbeats in TMR patients who had previous bypass surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;It is abundantly clear that there is not a mortality benefit to this procedure,&quot; Tracy said. PLC agreed with her assessment.</p>
<p>The panel also said the company had not proved that the restored blood flow actually reduced chest pain, or angina.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the channels created by TMR may cause new capillaries to grow. But panellists said PLC could not prove any theory, leading to worries that with so many unknowns, the procedure could end up harming patients.</p>
<p>If the panel understood the mechanism of action, it &quot;probably wouldn't have any reservations,&quot; said committee member Dr. Henry Edmunds of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre.</p>
<p>Using the device, a surgeon drills 15 to 40 1-millimetre-wide channels in oxygen-starved tissue in the heart's left ventricle to restore the flow of blood.</p>
<p>At the request of the company on Friday, the American Stock Exchange halted trade in PLC stock Monday pending the FDA's decision. The FDA's vote came after the close of trade.</p>
