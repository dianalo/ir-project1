<headline>FORECAST - Italy Dec car registrations seen steady.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1997-01-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Italian new car registrations in December are expected to show a slight rise on December 1995 to above 100,000 units, according to industrial sources and analysts.</p>
<p>But because December 1996 had one more working day than the same 1995 month, on the same work-day basis the figures are expected to be in line with year-ago levels.</p>
<p>New car registrations in December 1995 were 98,959 while the full-year 1995 total was 1,731,277.</p>
<p>In the January-November 1996 period registrations totalled 1,626,953.</p>
<p>December new registrations data are due to be published by the Ministry of Transport on January 10.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that in December the 100,000 level could be slightly exceeded,&quot; said Giampaolo Trasi, analyst at Milan brokers IMI-Sigeco. &quot;It's probable the figure will come in around 102,000 with an increase of about three percent representing the calendar effect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>For Ilaria Fornari, analyst at JP Morgan in Milan, &quot;We forecast 105,000 new registrations, a rise of some five percent year-on-year. If this is the case the 1996 total will be unchanged on 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;On a seasonally-adjusted basis, the figures for the last few months have shown a slight increase,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>One industry source who declined to be named said, &quot;Very likely we will see a figure above 100,000 units.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we need to see what will be the effect of the renewal of company car fleets which many firms carry out for tax reasons before the end of the calendar year,&quot; the source added.</p>
<p>The effects of the government's new incentive scheme to boost domestic new car sales will only be seen later in 1997.</p>
<p>Car giant Fiat has said the scheme, to operate from January to September and which will give motorists cash bonuses for trading in cars over 10-years-old for scrapping in exchange for buying new models, could generate a total 300,000 new car sales, half of them Fiat models.</p>
<p>But some analysts said the beneficial impact on new sales from the scheme might have been somewhat overrated.</p>
<p>One source noted that although over 30 percent of cars on Italian roads were over 10-years-old, &quot;a large number have recently had their regular official inspection and their owners have often spent a lot of money so their vehicles could pass the test, so it's not obvious they'll be wanting to immediately scrap them for new models.&quot;</p>
