<headline>Fire at NBC closes programming, streets.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>An electrical fire at NBC headquarters in Rockefeller Plaza forced the closure of midtown Manhattan streets and stopped the network's local programming on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The fire began about 4 a.m. EDT (0800 GMT) in a storeroom on the 10th floor of the 70-story General Electric Co. building, officials said. The building was evacuated and five hours later, the fire was under control, a Fire Department spokesman said.</p>
<p>Some 320 firefighters were working at the scene and streets were closed in the midtown Manhattan area, snarling morning rush-hour traffic.</p>
<p>Fire Department spokesman Jack Thompson said 11 firefighters and building occupants were treated for smoke inhalation. There were no serious injuries.</p>
<p>Local news programming at WNBC-TV was affected by the fire but the network's Today Show, located in a separate building across the street, went on the air as scheduled.</p>
<p>The GE building is also home to the network's Nightly News program and a number of other programs are taped there, including Late Night With Conan O'Brien and the Rosie O'Donnell show.</p>
