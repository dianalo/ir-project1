<p>MGE spring wheat futures settled mixed and above their lows, with new-crop September buoyed after USDA's estimate of spring wheat production came in below analysts' estimates, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing today was that our September was firmer than our Dec and March because there's thoughts of more damage out there and not quite the yields that people were expecting,&quot; an MGE floor source said.</p>
<p>In its July crop report, USDA pegged U.S. spring wheat production at 569 million bushels, which was much lower than the average analysts' estimate of 634 million.</p>
<p>But spring wheat remained weak early on spillover pressure from other U.S. wheat markets after USDA's July crop report pegged 1997 U.S. winter wheat production at 1.781 billion bushels. That exceeded the average analysts' expectation of 1.687 million bushels.</p>
<p>Spring wheat futures also weakened as Cargill Investor Services sold at least two million Sept bushels.</p>
<p>&quot;That probably halted any huge rallies,&quot; the MGE source said of Cargill's sale.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat settled 1-1/4 cents per bushel lower to 1-1/2 cents higher, with new crop Sept up 1-1/2 cents at $3.56-3/4.</p>
<p>Traders said Frontier Futures sold a few hundred thousand bushels of the March 1998 contract at the close, forcing the Sept/March spread to narrow and settle at nine cents. On Thursday, that spread was trading at 14 cents, and it spent most of Friday trading between 12 and 12-1/2 cents.</p>
