<p>Kuwait expects oil prices  to stay high through 1997, Nasser al-Rodhan, deputy premier and finance minister said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Although oil prices are governed by several factors which are not fully controlled by the producers we believe prices in 1997 will maintain their current high levels,&quot; Rodhan said.</p>
<p>Speaking to Reuters in an interview in Damascus where he is on an official visit, Rodhan said market conditions were expected to continue to be favourable. He gave no details.</p>
<p>He said the continuation of the high prices would make &quot;welcome positive impacts on the economy but the government would not make its calculations on the price rise.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the country's 1996-1997 June-July budget of 4.2 billion kuwaiti dinars ($14.02 billion) was based on a low oil price of $13 a barrel &quot;to avoid any unexpected or sudden developments.&quot;</p>
<p>Kuwait has an production quota of two million barrels per day as set by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Kuwaiti crude is prices at a differential to Saudi Arabia's Arab medium grade, currently priced for European customers at a discount to North Sea Brent equating to around $20 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;The high prices would certainly improve the country's national income which depends for more than 90 per cent on the oil revenue but our budget calculations are made on a price of $13 per barrel,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>The price for Brent has recently held within a range of $20-25, compared to prices of between $15-20 that have been dominant for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Rodhan said Kuwait would base next year's budget at $13 a barrel and would project a spending increase of 10 percent over this year's budget.</p>
<p>This year's deficit of 1.2 billion dinar would also be cut by 250 dinars in the next year's budget, the minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to bring the deficit in the government's budget to the zero point in the 1999-2000 budget and we will continue with a programme to increase projected spending by 10 percent until then,&quot; Rodhan said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to go on with our plans unless there are any surprises or unexpected international developments,&quot; the minister said.</p>
