<p>German shares ended bourse trade on Thursday down nearly two percent, catching up with losses in IBIS trade from Wednesday and fresh pressure from a weaker dollar and overnight Wall Street losses.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index ended bourse trade down 65.59 points at 3,349.81 points but off the day's low at 3,338.53 points.</p>
<p>Traders said the drop may be the start of a long-awaited market correction in response to the recent heady gains, including a 20 percent rise in the DAX in the last 10 weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's healthy and not much of a worry,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;The drop is pretty much in line with what a lot of people have been expecting for some time,&quot; the Frankfurt trader said. &quot;This should help make the market a bit more attractive.&quot;</p>
<p>Chemical shares remained in the spotlight as Hoechst AG initially kept up its decline from Wednesday tied to disappointment over the shelving of plans for Hoechst to list its Hoechst Marion Roussel pharmaceuticals unit on the bourse.</p>
<p>Hoechst shares, which fell 10 percent on Wednesday, ended bourse trade down 1.65 marks at 68.80 marks but reversed course in IBIS trade to gain 26 pfennigs at 69.40 marks.</p>
<p>Other chemical sector shares, including Bayer AG, BASF AG and Schering AG, were all also lower in early dealings.</p>
<p>Shares in engineering group Deutz AG slumped as much as 1.75 marks to 12 marks on profit-taking before ending down 85 pfennigs at 12.90 marks.</p>
<p>Deutz was under pressure after surging in recent days after a report in Germany's Platow Brief saying the company, formerly known as Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, would return to a profit this year. Deutz plans to release its results on May 15.</p>
<p>Carmaker Volkswagen AG ended down 23.50 marks at 928 marks despite its Audi luxury unit confirming a Wall Street Journal report saying Audi was contemplating a U.S. factory site.</p>
