<p>The Australian share market secured strong gains by the close on Monday with the banks showing the way higher as both U.S. and local bond markets rallied.</p>
<p>By 4.25 p.m. (0525 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was 23.4 points higher at 2,461.9.</p>
<p>The March share index futures contract was 31 points higher at 2,459, a 2.9 point discount to the underlying index.</p>
<p>Traders said that while the performance was a convincing one, turnover was subdued with a public holiday in Victoria taking a number of institutions out of the market.  </p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. was obviously an inspiration,&quot; said a Perth dealer. &quot;The banks had a big run on the back of bonds.&quot;</p>
<p>The bank index closed 1.3 percent higher, compared to a gain in the benchmark All Ordinaries index of about one percent.</p>
<p>National Australia Bank bouncing back 1.4 percent to A$16.18 after Friday's fall, and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, also climbing about 1.4 percent to A$13.24, led that sector to higher ground.</p>
<p>Among others, mineral explorer Kingsgate Consolidated continued its 1997 ascent, jumping 12 percent to A$3.13 on speculation of a resource upgrade at its Thai gold project.  </p>
<p>On the downside, Centennial Coal slumped 16.2 percent to A$1.40, a two year low, after Friday's reporting of a slump in first half net profit to A$1.1 million from A$2.67 million.</p>
<p>Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about nine to five, while about 30 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>FUTURES/OPTIONS - Derivatives trade was modest with few features in either futures or options markets.</p>
<p>Total options traded 17,738 (29,548)</p>
<p>Turnovber in March SPI contracts totalled 6,739 (6,672)  </p>
<p>In other local markets, long-dated Australian bond yields staged a marked recovery after brushing 8.0 percent in after hours trading over the weekend, but interest was fairly light given the magnitude of the rally. By 5.05 p.m. (0605 GMT), 10 year T-bonds were yielding 7.8 percent, down from 7.96 Friday.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar spent its fifth straight session consolidating in a US$0.7835/7910 channel and dealers expected the hiatus to linger a while yet. By 5.05 p.m. (0600 GMT) the unit was at US$0.7861/66 having bent to US$0.7862/67 early from Friday's US$0.7893/89. Key levels were US$0.7835 and US$0.7910 and a break of either would likely release a 1/2 cent move.  </p>
