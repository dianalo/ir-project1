<p>Poland's state treasury approved a share issue of 250-750 million zlotys to selected investors by state-owned insurance firm  Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen SA (PZU), a finance ministry official said.</p>
<p>The head of the ministry's insurance department, Anatol Adamski, said on Friday the shares were to be sold by the end of March 1997 and it was up to PZU's supervisory board and management to find prospective institutional investors.</p>
<p>&quot;A motion has been passed for issuing new shares of between 250 and 750 million zlotys...and it (the exact value of the issue) depends on the negotiations with prospective investors,&quot; he told Reuters after a PZU shareholders' general meeting.</p>
<p>Adamski said the issue would give several institutional investors up to 50 percent in the firm jointly, but none of them would have more than 10-15 percent of the shares.</p>
<p>He declined to name investors who were already negotiating on acquiring stakes in PZU, Poland's largest insurer.</p>
<p>Earlier PZU said it was in talks or initiating contacts with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the International Finance Corporation.</p>
<p>PZU President Jan Monkiewicz told Gazeta Wyborcza daily this week the firm was negotiating with state-owned bank Pekao SA on acquisition of PZU shares.</p>
<p>Also this week, the head of the State Insurance Supervision Office, Danuta Walcerz, said PZU lacked about 400 million zlotys to cover the solvency margin which it must ensure under Polish law.</p>
<p>Adamski said the company was planning to enter the Warsaw Stock Exchange but the initial public offering could take place in mid-1997 at the earliest.</p>
<p>He said the state treasury did not so far plan to sell its shares in PZU, but because of the new issues its stake would be diluted to about 30 percent.</p>
<p>PZU, which has about 60 percent of the non-life insurance market, collected a total of 2.7 billion zlotys in gross premiums in the first three quarters of 1996.</p>
<p>Last year it had a net profit of 105.2 million zlotys on gross premiums of 2.2 billion zlotys.</p>
