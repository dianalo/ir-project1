<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian dlr takes stock after rewarding week.</title>
<headline>Australian dlr takes stock after rewarding week.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian dollar hung around in a snug range at a quiet midsession as the market took stock after amassing a cent of gains this week.</p>
<p>Data on domestic retail sales proved a touch softer than expected with a fall of 0.3 percent against forecasts of a flat result, which disappointed some bulls who had hoped for a strong enough result to extinguish all thoughts of another easing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, real sales were still up a healthy 2.2 percent on the quarter and thus promised to add 0.5 point to GDP growth.</p>
<p>The currency was supported by talk of buying for another dual currency samurai bond supposedly worth 25 billion yen.  </p>
<p>By 12.30 pm (0230 GMT) the currency had settled at US$0.7838/43 after see-sawing in a US$0.7835/7853 range through the morning having finished Thursday at US$0.7747/52.</p>
<p>Traders reported offers around US$0.7860 chart resistance, perhaps related to options positions, and a further stiff technical barrier lay ahead at US$0.7890/7905.</p>
<p>Support was seen at US$0.7830 and US$0.7795 and there was talk of possible offshore buying related to the sale of three Federal airports. These are rumoured to be worth a total A$3.0 billion and two of the bidding consortium do include foreign companies, suggesting a need for A$ might exist.  </p>
<p>However, their partners were large Australian institutions and dealers felt much of the money needed would be raised here.</p>
<p>But buying from Japan was real enough as a seachange in yields spreads this week had attracted demand for government bonds and prompted a revival of the yen/A$ dual currency samurai issues which were so popular last year.</p>
<p>This helped edge the dolalr up to 99.28/38 from an early 99.05/15, although that was still off Thursday's high around 100.03, which was its first venture atop the mystical 100.00 level since since May 1992. In trade weighted terms it had eased slightly to 60.9 from 61.1 late here Thursday.  </p>
<p>Today's March retail trade data were not emphatic enough to entirely rule out the chance of another Reserve Bank rate cut, but given the unexpected strength seen in Q1 wages data yesterday analysts reckoned it was safe to assume policy would be on hold for this month at least.</p>
<p>The RBA's board holds its monthly policy meeting Tuesday and there had been some speculation it might take advantage of low inflation to ease policy and give employment a fillip.</p>
<p>The talk might yet revive if jobs data on Thursday are weak again so the market will be cautious until then.</p>
