<p>Canadian bonds closed firmer in quiet trade on Monday, with spreads to U.S. long bonds widening amid waning concern about a possible U.S. rate hike and a stronger Canadian dollar, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a really solid bid under this market,&quot; said Hank Cunningham, director of fixed-income research with First Marathon Securities Ltd. &quot;The dollar has finally turned some corners here, so I think that's helped more than anything else.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.15 to C$111.32 to yield 7.045 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 1/32 to yield 6.87 percent. The spread between the two bonds narrowed to 18 basis points from 19 basis points at the close of trading on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is coming to grips (with the fact) that there's a smaller and smaller probability of the Fed going in May and the implications for the Canadian dollar,&quot; said one Toronto-based bond trader. &quot;On top of that the technicals have been great. There's been buying and very little selling.&quot;</p>
<p>Canadian and U.S. fixed-income markets saw sharp gains last week, with the Canadian market closing stronger for four out of five sessions.  </p>
<p>Canadian bonds rallied last week amid economic reports that reduced expectations of tightening by the Fed. Declining expectations for a rate hike also benefited the currency, which firmed further today to close below C$1.38 (US$0.7246)</p>
<p>Analysts said Canadian markets would likely trade sideways for the early part of this week amid a lack of significant U.S. economic data. Canadian economic reports this morning on foreign reserves and building permits had little to no impact on bonds, dealers said.  </p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bonds rose C$0.15 to C$103.65 to yield 6.475 percent. The U.S. bond rose 1/32 to yield 6.64 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds widened to 17 basis points from 15 basis points on Friday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 2.97 percent against its U.S. equivalent, which yielded 5.11 percent.</p>
