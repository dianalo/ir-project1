<p>SCP Pool Corp said Wednesday that it expects to report higher net sales and earnings for 1997 based on the underlying trends in its business, which is the distribution of swimming pool supplies and related products.</p>
<p>The company said that first-quarter results, released last week, included a 55 percent gain in net sales to $63.6 million and a net loss of $603,000, or $0.14 per share.</p>
<p>But SCP said that first-quarter results were fully in line with its expectations and included a 14.5 percent  gain in same-store sales.  The company also said that its performance for the first quarter, which is not the strongest period of the year for the pool supply business, reflected the inclusion of the BioLab service centers, acquired last fall.</p>
<p>For 1996, the Company reported net sales of $236 million, net income of $4.5 million and fully diluted net income per share of $1.05.</p>
