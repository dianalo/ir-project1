<title>USA: Crestar, Grad &amp; Walker in deal.</title>
<headline>Crestar, Grad &amp; Walker in deal.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Crestar Energy Inc said early Wednesday that it has an agreement to acquire Grad &amp; Walker Energy Corp in a deal worth about $336.2 million.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Crestar would acquire Grad &amp; Walker in exchange for $13.50 cash or, at the election of depositing shareholders, 0.509 Crestar common shares for each Grad &amp; Walker common share.</p>
<p>A maximum of 5 million Crestar common shares will be available under the share election. If all Grad &amp; Walker common shares are tendered, the value of the offer will be about $336.2 million, it said.  </p>
<p>As recently as Monday, Crestar Chief Executive Barry Jackson said the company did not have a deal for Grad &amp; Walker. Crestar operates in areas close to Grad &amp; Walker's, which include the Marengo and Mantario East oil plays in southwestern Saskatchewan and Three Hills Creek in central Alberta.</p>
<p>Grad &amp; Walker Resources Ltd, a holding company, and certain officers and directors of Grad &amp; Walker, who collectively hold about 21 percent of the outstanding Grad &amp; Walker shares on a fully diluted basis, have agreed to deposit and not withdraw their Grad &amp; Walker shares under the offer.</p>
<p>Crestar's offer has the unanimous support of the boards of directors of both companies.</p>
<p>Grad &amp; Walker has agreed to pay Crestar a non-completion fee of 2.8 percent plus costs in certain circumstances and has agreed not to solicit other transaction proposals, the companies said.</p>
