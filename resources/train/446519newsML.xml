<headline>Zaire capital tense, Mobutu support waning.</headline>

<p>Zaire's embattled government has moved to ease frayed nerves in the tense capital Kinshasa, where popular support for veteran President Mobutu Sese Seko is fading fast.</p>
<p>The cabinet, meeting in emergency session on Monday, dismissed rumours that a coup was imminent following major rebel gains in the east, that Zaire's notoriously undisciplined army was poised to run riot or that Mobutu was dead.</p>
<p>But many people in the usually lively city opted to stay home rather than venture onto the streets in the evening.</p>
<p>The name of rebel leader Laurent Kabila is on many lips in the city of five million people. Many people openly or privately welcome the prospect of a change of leadership. Others acknowledge that change is starting to look inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment it looks as though the doors are open for Mr Kabila,&quot; one Zairean banker commented. &quot;There is no-one left in Kinshasa who is strong enough to sustain a take over.&quot;</p>
<p>Mobutu, who has spent most of his time in Europe since prostate cancer surgery there in August, telephoned the ministers twice during their Monday meeting from his hospital bed in the Mediterranean Principality of Monaco.</p>
<p>Mobutu's son and spokesman Mobutu Nzanga said there was no cause for concern over his father's health. &quot;He came for extra medical tests. He will leave the hospital very soon to prepare for his return home,&quot; he said after visiting him.</p>
<p>But in Zaire's third city of Kisangani, which fell to the rebels on Saturday, residents celebrated the departure of Mobutu's army as about 300 soldiers surrendered their weapons -- apparently little moved by their defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that winning the war is the easiest part of the job. Much more difficult is the restoration of the country destroyed by more than 30 years of Mobutu's regime,&quot; the local rebel commander, Kabila's son Joseph, 25, commented.</p>
<p>In Kinshasa, the cabinet appealed for calm.</p>
<p>&quot;The government invites the people not to panic as this is both unjustified and fed by pure rumour,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>But one senior official said government ministers and Mobutu allies were among those most affected and panicked by the rumours of the president's deteriorating health and increasing concern over the loyalty of troops and their commanders.</p>
<p>Travel agents reported a post-weekend rush to book seats on flights out of the country. Planes to Europe and South Africa were the most popular.</p>
<p>In Kinshasa's central market, traders prepared to transfer their goods to safe houses, anticipating the mayhem that has regularly occurred after rebels have defeated the army.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the habit of our soldiers to start looting so we have to take precautions,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Many Kinshasa residents say they are eager for a change from Mobutu, accused by opponents of ruining what is potentially one of Africa's richest nations, but few see Kabila as little more than a war leader.</p>
<p>An opinion poll in the city this month found just over 50 percent of those questioned had a high opinion of Kabila but only four percent said they would vote for him.</p>
