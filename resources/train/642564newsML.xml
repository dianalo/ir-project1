<p>LIFFE cocoa futures saw late short-covering late on Friday to end flat to slightly higher nearly across the board.</p>
<p>July closed steady at 995 stg per tonne and September gained three to 1,019. Total volume stood at 6,407 contracts but most of that was seen in crosses.</p>
<p>Traders said crosses included 700 July/September contracts traded at 22 stg, 600 September/March and 600 May 1998 traded to help lift volume.</p>
<p>In outright activity, they said a commission house bought at least 600 contracts distributed between September, December, March and May. They speculated the buying was for a single trade house.</p>
<p>But nearby months spent most of the day in negative ground due to more fund and speculator liquidation. Floor sources said traders seemed to have underestimated the size of long positions held in London and were caught off guard.</p>
<p>They said traders had expected about 3,000 to 4,000 lots to be liquidated but have so far, received about double that. That has spurred some to believe a long July holder took advantage of the liquidation to hide a rollover of long Julys into forward months.</p>
<p>They noted that the September/December spread has remained little changed compared to other spreads. September/December closed at one stg versus July/September's 24, December/March's 12 and March/May's 11. They said a fairer value for September/December in relation to the other spreads would normally be closer to 11.</p>
<p>Though most of the July liquidation has occurred this week, traders speculated there was more to go. Some estimated another few thousand longs had to be flushed out of the market, which would keep prices pressured.</p>
<p>Most traders expected July to revisit the April 9 low of 980 though July has resisted breaking that level three times in the past two months.</p>
<p>If 980 fails to hold, they expected to hit sell-stops and then a rash of fresh selling from funds and speculators. But they said the bulk of sales may be seen in September instead of July as September edges closer to overtaking the front-month position.</p>
<p>On the charts, technical analysts did not see any solid support for July until about 950 if 980 breaks.</p>
<p>July and September each traded about 1,345 contracts to lead volume. Options volume was nil.</p>
