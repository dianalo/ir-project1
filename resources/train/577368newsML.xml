<p>Slovak blue chips closed mixed, pushing the SAX index slightly up in thin session on the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Monday, with brokers expecting few surprises in trading this week.</p>
<p>Steel producer VSZ dominated trading on the floor with 18,957 traded shares, but closed unchanged at 750 crowns while oil refiner Slovnaft closed unchanged at 1,015.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently there are two leaders, VSZ and Slovnaft, moving the index, but otherwise the bourse is pretty quiet,&quot; Radovan Dzugas of Creditanstalt said. &quot;I don't think this would change very soon,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Some investors say VSZ has the potential to climb close to its nominal (of 1,000),&quot; he said, adding, that in the case of Slovnaft the question is who will accept higher prices of several large offered blocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall volume fell to 163,108 shares, from 726,061 shares traded on Friday, while turnover fell to 43.44 million crowns from 683.05 million.</p>
