<headline>Canadian bonds close stronger after Greenspan news.</headline>

<p>Canadian bonds rallied to a stronger close on Tuesday after comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan eased fears of a short-term interest rate hike.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a classic relief bid. He didn't say anything to upset us,&quot; said Jim Webber, Toronto-Dominion's director of fixed-income research. Greenspan said on the first day of his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins economic report that the U.S. economy was strong but its growth was slowing, signaling that rates would remain steady for now. Canada's 30-year benchmark bond soared C$1.82 to C$120.48 to yield 6.445 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond gained 54/32 to yield 6.41 percent. The spread between the two issues widened to four basis points from three basis points at Monday's close.</p>
<p>The rally forced the Canadian yield curve to flatten out a bit, Webber said. T-bills firmed slightly as investors anticipated that the Bank of Canada may eventually have to raise rates to prop up a weakening Canadian currency, he said.</p>
<p>The dollar softened to C$1.3785 (US$0.7254) at Tuesday's close from C$1.3772 (US$0.7261) on Monday but firmed from Tuesday's opening levels of C$1.3804 (US$0.7244).  </p>
<p>Market players are awaiting the rest of Greenspan's testimony on Wednesday and a new 30-year Government of Canada bond supply. The Bank of Canada will auction C$1.3 billion of 8.0 percent bonds due June 1, 2027.</p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond rose C$0.89 to C$110.10 to yield 5.883 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond gained 32/32 to yield 6.13 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds narrowed to 25 basis points from Monday's close.</p>
