<p>Papua New Guinea's defence force commander turned against the government on Monday over its plans to use mercenaries to quash a rebellion on Bougainville island.</p>
<p>But the commander said there was no coup in the South Pacific nation and appealed to troops to remain calm.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me assure you that we do not intend to have any coup, I can guarantee you that,&quot; Brigadier General Jerry Singirok said on Kalang FM radio in Port Moresby.</p>
<p>Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio reported that the army and police had revolted and called on the South Pacific nation's governor-general to sack the government.</p>
<p>The Australian Associated Press news agency said Singirok had said the foreign mercenaries in the country had been detained and would be expelled.</p>
<p>Defence force chief of staff Jack Tuat told Reuters that Singirok had visited the governor-general but was unable to say what had been discussed.</p>
<p>Tuat said Singirok had addressed 300 to 400 troops at the Murray Barracks defence headquarters in Port Moresby before visiting the governor-general.</p>
<p>&quot;He was against the government employment of Sandline (mercenaries)...,&quot; Tuat told Reuters. &quot;He said to leave everything to him and to remain calm. All troops are at work doing their mormal duties.&quot;</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has hired 40 African mercenaries to train troops in a bid to end a nine-year uprising by the Bougainville Revolutionary Army.</p>
<p>The mercenary contract is with the British-based firm Sandline International, which has in turn hired soldiers from the South African private army Executive Outcomes..</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot go to Bougainville with the arsenal of arms and blow up Bougainville and come and tell the people what I have done,&quot; Singirok said on Kalang FM.</p>
<p>Australia, backed by the United States and New Zealand, has vigorously opposed Chan's plans to use mercenaries to end the Bougainville war, which has killed thousands of people.</p>
