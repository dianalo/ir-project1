<p>Iran has asked Syria's permission to make use of its spy network in Europe to get around the tighter surveillance of its secret agents there, a German newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said it had learned from British MI6 secret service sources that Iran had seen Syria's apparent success in building modern weaponry plants and believed it could benefit from a collaboration between the two on intelligence.</p>
<p>Compared to Iranian agents, Syrian spies are subject to much less surveillance in European countries such as Germany, the newspaper said in a summary of an article to appear in its Friday edition.</p>
<p>It added the request had been made by a high-ranking Iranian official to Damascus some time ago and had still not been answered.</p>
<p>The Israeli secret service Mossad had learned of the request and had informed its government which had expressed concern, the newspaper said, citing secret service sources.</p>
