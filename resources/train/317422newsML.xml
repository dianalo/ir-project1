<p>South Korea said on Sunday it would delay arresting seven fugitive union leaders holed up in a Seoul cathedral after they agreed to halt indefinite strikes against a new labour law that have hit industry for more than three weeks.</p>
<p>The domestic Yonhap News Agency quoted a senior official from the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office as saying police had put off storming Myongdong Cathedral to arrest the unionists.</p>
<p>Despite the softening government stance, violent clashes continued between riot police and students, showing passions over the law were still inflamed.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that there is a lull in the strikes and political figures are seeking dialogue, it is necessary to exercise flexibility in executing the arrest warrants,&quot; the unnamed prosecution official was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Prosecutors were not available to confirm the report.</p>
<p>The government has previously shown no signs of backing down on its threat to arrest the unionists. Police picked up another union leader on Saturday, bringing to five the number arrested in recent days.</p>
<p>But in a major backdown, Kwon Young-kil, head of the outlawed Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and one of the seven taking refuge in the cathedral, has said union members would limit strikes to Wednesdays only.</p>
<p>Confederation heads said the focus was now on trying to revise the new law, which makes it easier for firms to sack workers, after previously insisting it must be scrapped.</p>
<p>However, with a tight security net still in place around the cathedral, and regular clashes between protesters and riot police in the streets since the bill was rammed through parliament on December 26, the situation remained volatile.</p>
<p>Riot police mounted several raids on Hanyang University in the capital just after midday on Sunday, firing teargas to try to disperse up to 1,000 students rallying against both the labour legislation and a new security law.</p>
<p>Armour-plated vehicles unleashed barrages of teargas at the students, who initially fled but then regrouped and hurled molotov cocktails and fought with iron bars in intermittant clashes lasting one hour.</p>
<p>The students later converged near Myongdong where police waded in, firing teargas and clubbing students with batons.</p>
<p>Witnesses said police dragged more than 10 students away but it was unclear if they had been detained. That clash lasted just under an hour.</p>
<p>Any decision to storm the cathedral and drag out the seven unionists camped out in a ramshackle tent would spark a political storm in a country where more than a quarter of the population are practising Christians.</p>
<p>Separately, the first member of a team of 10 world labour leaders arrived on Sunday to put pressure on the government to scrap the most inflammatory parts of the legislation.</p>
<p>Vic Thorpe, head of the International Chemical Workers' Federation, said the team would meet strike leaders at Myongdong and follow up efforts of four union colleagues who left last week after deportation threats.</p>
<p>Seoul's top immigration official has said the new delegation would be expelled if it joined strike-related protests.</p>
<p>Hyundai Motor Co Ltd, the nation's largest car maker, reopened on Saturday. Other key factories in the export sector have operated normally for several days.</p>
<p>Output losses from the strikes have amounted to 2.6 trillion won ($3.1 billion). Lost exports have hit $467 million.</p>
<p>The latest union leader to be arrested was seized in the southeastern city of Ulsan, home of the Hyundai Group, which has been at the forefront of the strikes.</p>
<p>President Kim Young-sam has refused to revise or scrap the law, arguing labour reform is crucial to trim corporate costs and improve competitiveness.</p>
