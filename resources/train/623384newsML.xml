<p>The June Australian three-year bond futures contract struck a new high for 1997 of 93.67 in after hours trading, continuing the advance since last Friday's official interest rate cut.</p>
<p>The contract ended SYCOM at this peak compared with Thursday's firm 93.61 pit close and after finally overcoming the 93.60 level which was seen immediately after the rate cut.</p>
<p>The contract is now in the thick of a 93.65/93.68 resistance zone and a break could see a test of 93.72 en route to the 93.80 peak seen briefly last December, and highest level seen since February 1994.  </p>
<p>However, &quot;Strength past 93.68, if seen, should be sold,&quot; said Peter Pontikis, technical analyst at Westpac.</p>
<p>He said the contract is already in an overbought zone, the three/10-year bond futures spread is near major resistance at 125 basis points and a potential retracement in U.S. Treasuries should all hold back the three-year contract.</p>
<p>Bill futures also firmed in SYCOM with the September position touching a contract high of 94.57, equating to a cash rate of 5.43 percent and just below 5.5 percent official rates.</p>
<p>Economists are reluctant to discount another easing, and speculation was fuelled by comments from Prime Minister Howard.  </p>
<p>Speaking at a mining industry dinner Prime Minister John Howard said that while Australia had seen significant reductions in interest rates, real interest rates were still too high.</p>
<p>The market keenly awaits April retail trade at 11.30 a.m. (0130 GMT) for an indication of current demand. Forecasts centre on a 0.5 percent rise after the 0.3 percent fall in March, according to a Reuters survey of economists.</p>
<p>Also due are April motor registrations, which are seen being flat, and first quarter balance of payments, forecast to show a A$4.8 billion deficit.</p>
