<p>A mother and grandmother fed a 5-year-old girl a deadly potion of ammonia, vinegar, olive oil and pepper, then put her body in a garbage bag on the curb to be picked up by garbage collectors, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Police charged the mother, Angelic Burney, 25, and Rosa Wilkerson, 46, with murder in the second degree for the act, which they believe took place on April 27.</p>
<p>Child welfare authorities had investigated the family earlier and were alerted when kindergartner Amy Burney stopped attending school.</p>
<p>Police initially held the mother because she would not say what happened to the missing girl.</p>
<p>The grandmother told reporters on Saturday that the girl had complained of stomach pains and had died of natural causes in bed. She said she and her daughter panicked because of the previous suspicions of child abuse, and after several days they wrapped the girl in blankets and her crib mattress and put the body out in the garbage.</p>
<p>Police said upon further questioning she admitted to the poisoning. They said they were searching the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island to find the body.</p>
<p>Burney's two other children, boys age 3 and 6 months old, have been placed in foster care.</p>
