<headline>Copper hovers at key $2,000 level as stocks tumble.</headline>

<p>World copper prices broke above the crucial $2,000-a-tonne barrier for the first time in seven weeks late on Thursday, and with visible stocks tumbling, the potential for further rallies looks good.</p>
<p>In fact many floor traders on the London Metal Exchange (LME) are surprised the price rise has not extended further, given that copper stocks have dropped 60 percent from the year's peak to just 145,825 tonnes.</p>
<p>One more big drawdown on Tuesday next week would take the total to the lowest level for over six years.</p>
<p>&quot;Comparing total stocks to prices (over the last fifteen years) we estimate that the price of copper should be $1.10 per pound ($2,425/tonne),&quot; said Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Co, part of Deutche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>He estimated total stocks at around 3.5 weeks' consumption, not far above the all-time low of 3.1 weeks'.</p>
<p>But Bielski explained there were special factors in play which are limiting the market's upside potential.</p>
<p>One was the perception that long positions were still being unwound by banks who took over Sumitomo Corp's massive exposure in the wake of the copper trading loss scandal.</p>
<p>Another was complacency about new supplies coming on stream next year from big mine expansions.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, looking into 1997, I don't think the market will be that far away from balance,&quot; Bielski said.</p>
<p>Floor traders added that there was a big question mark over whether the copper moving out of LME warehouses was being consumed or merely shifted to consumers' yards in Europe, warehouses in China and to the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>But physical merchants were confident that copper offtake was picking up, justifying the decline in inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing good business in the U.S., good business in the Far East and a shortage of scrap forcing people to take more LME material as a substitue,&quot; said one European merchant.</p>
<p>And of the 40,000 tonnes going to China, the merchant estimated only 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes was likely to find its way back into LME warehouses in Singapore.</p>
<p>Other dampeners on the copper price were influential short position holders trying to protect their exposure and producers selling into rallies in case the market collapses, traders said.</p>
<p>Joining copper on its upward path this week has been aluminium, the second most heavily-traded of the LME contracts.</p>
<p>From a 2-1/2 year low of $1,305 a tonne earlier this month prices have recovered over 10 percent to a six-week high of $1,441 early on Friday.</p>
<p>Tightening nearby supplies and modest fund buying were behind the move, further boosted by market rumours that the six signatories to a 1994 production-cutting pact may be considering renewing the agreement to boost prices.</p>
<p>But Canadian sources in Moscow denied such intentions on Friday, knocking values off the highs.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the commodity markets, wheat prices took a dive in Chicago on Thursday on a surprise hike in the EU's export subsidy for wheat and dismal weekly U.S. wheat export sales.</p>
<p>December wheat closed down 14-1/2 cents per bushel to $3.84, just above a half the value during the price spike in March.</p>
