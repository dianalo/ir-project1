<title>BOSNIA: Hardliners prevail in Bosnia's &quot;Berlin&quot;.</title>

<p>A Croat ambush on Moslems visiting a cemetery has illustrated the international community's utter failure to reunite the city and its willingness to tolerate nationalist hard-liners, analysts say.</p>
<p>Three years since the war between Croats and Moslems ended, ultra-nationalists and their criminal allies are still firmly entrenched in Croat-held western Mostar, U.N. relief workers and diplomats say.</p>
<p>&quot;The war has ended but not much else has changed here,&quot; said one U.N. relief official.</p>
<p>Generous infusions of financial aid and patient diplomacy have done nothing to alter the communal divide between Bosnian Moslems and Croats in Mostar.</p>
<p>Some of the buildings that were destroyed in 10 months of Moslem-Croat war had been repaired with European money, but people in Mostar live in a partitioned town.</p>
<p>The former front-line that straddles the Neretva River serves as an unofficial Berlin Wall. Policemen stand at street corners ready to stop anyone with wrong registration plates, despite pledges to allow &quot;freedom of movement&quot;.</p>
<p>Monday's violence, in which Croats opened fire at Moslems visiting a graveyard in the Croat-held western sector, drew strong condemnation from Western governments.</p>
<p>But diplomatic protests are unlikely to change the political landscape in Mostar. Diplomats say Croats opposed to co-existence with Moslems have learned they can act with virtual impunity.</p>
<p>The same men who drove Moslems from western Mostar and blew up the town's ancient Ottoman bridge still hold the reins and refuse to recognise an elected city administration.</p>
<p>The hard-liners include the former mayor of western Mostar Mijo Brajkovic, who still exerts influence as head of the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party.</p>
<p>Two prominent gangsters, who have close ties to the HDZ hard-liners, have profited mightily of the expulsions of Moslems from the western Mostar, diplomats say.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what is so disgusting -- the mafia is so closely connected to the authorities&quot;, said a U.N. official.</p>
<p>The Mostar Croats enjoy close ties to Gojko Susak, the powerful Croatian defence minister who armed and supported Croat separatists throughout the Bosnian conflict.</p>
<p>Susak and some of the main Bosnian Croat hard-liner nationalists share the same birthplace in Herzegovina region.</p>
<p>The United States and its European allies have repeatedly demanded that Susak and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman force their HDZ proteges to halt ethnic cleansing and nationalist obstruction.</p>
<p>But the Zagreb government said its influence is &quot;limited&quot; in Bosnia.</p>
<p>Relief workers, U.N. monitors and diplomats said they were discouraged by the clash at the cemetery but ruled out the possibility of a new war erupting in Mostar.</p>
<p>Despite rising tensions, the heavily armed NATO-led peace force is seen as a guarantor that the peace will hold in Mostar and elsewhere in Bosnia.</p>
<p>NATO officers say both Croats and Moslems are aware that neither side enjoys sufficient military strength to be confident of defeating the other in a possible conflict.</p>
<p>Balkan analysts warn that Croat obstruction has strengthened hard-liners among the Moslems and planted seeds for an eventual collision.</p>
<p>They say only indefinite deployment of NATO troops will keep the guns silent or forceful action to oust the hard-liners.</p>
