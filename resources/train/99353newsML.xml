<headline>Goodale says CWB barley vote going ahead in winter.</headline>

<p>Canadian Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale said on Monday that he would definitely go ahead with a farmers' vote on whether the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) should keep its export monopoly on barley.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we're proceeding with it during the course of the winter,&quot; he told reporters at Parliament.</p>
<p>He also threatened to counter any spending on the campaign by provinces seeking to influence the vote.  </p>
<p>&quot;If there is a bias in the process or a government treasury in the process that is unfairly skewing the process, then we'll have to consider the appropriate means and methodology to even things up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if that meant federal spending if the province of Alberta, which last month placed radio ads questioning the wheat board's monopoly, intervened, he said: &quot;It concerns me if one side (in the vote) has an artificial advantage, not based on the merits of the case but based on dollars to spend, and I'll be watching that very closely to ensure fairness.&quot;  </p>
<p>Goodale said last Friday that the government was &quot;considering&quot; a poll this winter on whether the CWB should end the export monopoly in both malt and feed barley. He also said he planned legislation creating a CWB board of directors.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction both in terms of editorial comment and from many of the major farm organizations has been quite encouraging,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he hoped his department's lawyers could draft the necessary legislation in the next couple of months.  </p>
<p>He said that if the legislation was already before Parliament and if farmers voted to dismantle the monopoly, the bill could be amended, or perhaps the bill could anticipate the different outcomes in advance.</p>
<p>Goodale said he should be able to pin down the rules on the plebiscite, for example who would be entitled to vote, in the next two to three weeks.</p>
<p>The minister dismissed criticism that he would be loading the vote in favour of the CWB by making the question of barley jurisdiction all or nothing, and on both malt and feed barley -- in contrast to recommendations of a grain marketing panel.</p>
<p>He said there were numerous arguments to suggest that a dual marketing system -- partly through CWB and partly private -- was &quot;just not viable.&quot;</p>
<p>Goodale said for example that a dilution of the pooling system would reduce security of supply in the case of a rising market, and in the case of a falling market the board could be swamped and would make initial payment guarantees untenable.</p>
<p>He said quality would also be more difficult to guarantee.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be that underlying assumptions that the dual marketing scenario could be viable is in fact not a valid assumption,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that there was the possibility of leakage between malt and feed barley, if both were not marketed in the same way.</p>
<p>&quot;In theory barley could be sold for feed purposes, move across the border, end up actually being used for a malt purpose and dramatically undercut the malting sector on the Canadian side of the border,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Goodale's department faxed to journalists a four-page release hailing the strengths of the CWB and describing weaknesses of the dual-marketing concept.</p>
