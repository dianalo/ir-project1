<p>House Republicans Wednesday threatened a showdown with the White House over legislation aimed at providing disaster relief for about 30 states by including a measure guaranteed to provoke a presidential veto.</p>
<p>The bill would allocate about $5 billion to about 30 states hit by natural disasters such as floods, mudslides and harsh weather. House Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner said it would contain a provision aimed at preventing a government shutdown that President Clinton vowed to veto.</p>
<p>&quot;We still continue to believe that it should include a continuing resolution to prevent any possibility of a government shutdown come Sept. 30,&quot; Boehner said. &quot;We also believe that bill will be on the floor of the House and Senate before the week is over and we'll send it to the president.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked what would happen if it is vetoed, the Ohio Republican told reporters after a House Republican meeting: &quot;We'll wait and see what the president decides to do.&quot;</p>
<p>A Republican aide said this week it was hoped the issue could be resolved quickly after Clinton vetoed the bill and that the House would then pass a disaster-relief measure with the government shutdown provision stripped out.</p>
<p>The legislation also provides another $2 billion for U.S. peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and continued U.S. military flights in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats Tuesday expressed anger over the stalled disaster relief bill and used some procedural manoeuvres to slow down what could have been quick consideration of the fiscal 1998 budget resolution.</p>
