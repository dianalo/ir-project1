<headline>Malaysia to arrest cocoa fall, improve processing.</headline>

<p>Malaysia's cocoa crop is hitting a floor at its current 120,000-130,000 tonnes a year level after prolonged decline but output could bounce back if world prices improve sharply, the country's head of Cocoa Board said.</p>
<p>Musa Jamil also said Malaysia planned to improve cocoa power quality to help tide over idle grinding capacity problem and step up processing of chocolates and other finished cocoa products.</p>
<p>Malaysia's cocoa bean output has fallen sharply from a peak of 240,000 tonnes in the 1989/90 crop year to an estimated 110,000 in the current 1996/97 season as prolonged price slump, disease and adverse weather took their toll on production.</p>
<p>But Musa, speaking to Reuters on the fringes of the International Cocoa Organisation talks in London, said the slide appeared to have been arrested.</p>
<p>He said the existence of small but hard-core producers and the introduction of better cocoa varieties helped halt the slide.</p>
<p>The total area under cocoa cultivation will be kept at 215,000 hectares after falling from a high of 420,000 in 1990.</p>
<p>Musa said some of the higher-yielding cocoa trees in the main growing area of Tawau on Borneo island have started maturing.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the grafted trees have started bearing while others may come into maturity in two or three years,&quot; he said. &quot;This will maintain and probably boost national production.&quot;</p>
<p>On grinding, Musa said the industry has been running at 100,000 tonnes of bean equivalent a year, well below its designed capacity of 125,000.</p>
<p>Grinders have been chasing the higher-value cocoa butter at the expense of cocoa powder, two by-products of cocoa bean.</p>
<p>Musa said grinders are now being encouraged to improve quality of cocoa powder in terms of colour and flavour and seek new markets to help maximise returns.</p>
<p>The main target markets for Malaysian cocoa powder are Turkey and Egypt.</p>
<p>Musa said chocolate manufacturers were also expected to step up local production in view of growing demand as income rises.</p>
<p>Per capita cocoa consumption is now seen at 0.7 kg a year against 0.2 kg in the late 1980s. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
