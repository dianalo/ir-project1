<title>CHINA: China T-bill makes strong debut on bank rate cut.</title>
<headline>China T-bill makes strong debut on bank rate cut.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-08-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>China's latest three-year treasury bill made a strong debut on the Shanghai stock exchange on Tuesday, rising 5.86 percent thanks to a cut in interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>They said volume, the bond market's third-biggest on record, stimulated the entire T-bill spot market in Shanghai, because buyers believed the bond was a better investment than a three-year bank deposit.</p>
<p>The debutant closed at 105.86 yuan ($12.75) compared to an issue price of 100.00 yuan. It opened at 106.80 yuan and hit a high of 107.00 in early trading before profit-taking emerged.</p>
<p>Volume was heavy at 9.928 million lots, helping the day's combined volume on the eight-contract Shanghai T-bill spot market rise to 12.1 million lots, the third-biggest in the four-year history of China's modern T-bond spot market.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Interest in the bond was not dampened by the fact that its coupon was only 10.96 percent, the lowest for a three-year T-bill since the 9.5 percent for a July 1992 issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The bond (price) was pushed up due to the bank interest rate cut,&quot; said Lu Weimin, a T-bill trader with China Guotai Securities.</p>
<p>On Friday the central bank cut bank deposit and lending rates by an average of 1.5 and 1.2 percentage points.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite its low coupon, falling bank interest rates have still made the bond more profitable than bank deposits,&quot; Lu added. &quot;This attracted many investors today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The new bond is likely to continue to rise in active trading in the next few days because its yield on the market has not reached the level of bank deposits for the same period,&quot; said an analyst with Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;But in the long run the bond is unlikely to replace the 10-year bond as a market barometer because the 10-year bond has a much higher coupon and other advantages,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Advantages include interest on the 10-year bond being paid on an annual basis instead of at maturity like the three-year bill, Shanghai traders said.</p>
<p>Based on Tuesday's closing price, the market yield of the bond was less than an annual eight percent, compared with the 8.28 percent annual interest rate for three-year bank deposits, they added.</p>
<p>Analysts said the strong debut indicated faith among investors that the economy would continue to perform strongly in the short term.</p>
<p>China's year-on-year inflation was 7.1 percent in the first half of 1996 compared with 14.8 percent for all of 1995. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth was 9.8 percent in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise in inflation is lower than economic growth for the first time since 1992,&quot; said a banking analyst with the Shanghai-based Communications Bank. &quot;Investors believe the existing treasury bills will give them the best returns over the next year or two.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite its low coupon, both Chinese retail investors and institutions snapped up the latest issue of new three-year bonds from August 6 to 26, due to falling inflation, lower bank interest rates and its high liquidity, analysts said.</p>
<p>A total of 30 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) worth of the three-year bonds were issued, bringing the total number of short-term T-bills and long-term bonds issued in China so far this year to 180 billion yuan.</p>
<p>China plans to issue a record 195.2 billion yuan worth of T-bills and bonds this year.</p>
