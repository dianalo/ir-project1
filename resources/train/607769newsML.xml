<p>France's opposition Socialists battled on Thursday to defuse charges that an upset win in parliamentary elections could derail a single European currency and undermine French foreign policy.</p>
<p>On the penultimate day of campaigning before the first round of the May 25-June 1 vote, the centre-right government stepped up attacks on the Socialists and Communists over Europe and said a new age of economic growth was dawning under its leadership.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Lionel Jospin, campaigning in Toulouse in the south-west, reiterated backing for a single European currency on four conditions, including the inclusion of Spain and Italy from the start.</p>
<p>Polls before a blackout at the weekend have shown the centre-right retaining power. But the French stock market was down 1.4 percent in early afternoon. Dealers blamed the weakness partly on rumours of secret polls showing the government's lead narrowing.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who was holding his final rally in the central city of Lyon, says Jospin's conditions and spending would make it impossible for France to meet fiscal targets for a single currency and would cause crisis in Europe.</p>
<p>Socialist former European Commissioner Jacques Delors retorted that the conditions set by the Socialists were within the spirit of the Maastricht treaty setting out the path to economic and monetary union -- of which he was an architect.</p>
<p>He told the daily Liberation that the impression abroad was that both the ruling centre-right and the Socialists favoured the euro. &quot;That will be the message people retain,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Francois Leotard, head of the junior partner in the ruling coalition, renewed charges that power-sharing between a Socialist-led government and conservative President Jacques Chirac would spell damaging discord for France.</p>
<p>He told the daily Le Monde there would be a president saying &quot;yes&quot; to the euro, a Socialist prime minister saying &quot;maybe&quot; and a tiny Communist party allied to the Socialists saying &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>Delors brushed aside Chirac's warning that a left-wing win would mean an unprecedented five-year &quot;cohabitation&quot; between left and right that could stop France speaking with one voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether one speaks of 1986 to 1988 or of 1993 to 1995, one could never have slipped a cigarette paper between the president and the prime minister,&quot; he said of the two previous bouts of &quot;cohabitation&quot; under the late Socialist Francois Mitterrand.</p>
<p>Jospin insisted that any other parties in a Socialist-led coalition would have to adopt his line on the euro.</p>
<p>Apart from the inclusion of Italy and Spain, Jospin wants a European &quot;economic government&quot; as a counterweight to the planned EU central bank, a pact of solidarity and growth to combat unemployment and measures to avoid over-valuation of the euro.</p>
<p>Communist party boss Robert Hue sought to play down public rifts with Jospin, whom he has accused of seeking hegemony over the left, as both left and right sought to patch over damaging internal rifts in the campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Jospin can cohabit with Robert Hue on Europe...the remaining obstacles can be overcome,&quot; Hue told Europe 1 radio.</p>
<p>Dominique Moisi, director of the French Institute of International Relations, said left and right had swapped roles over Europe since 1995, when Jospin accused Chirac in the presidential election of lacking commitment by suggesting a new referendum on European integration.</p>
<p>Politicians &quot;distance themselves from Europe in the campaign and when they get power they move closer to Germany&quot;, he told Reuters, predicting that a Socialist European policy would match that of Chirac. &quot;It's a game of musical chairs.&quot;</p>
