<p>UK physical grain trading was almost at a standstill on Wednesday with many traders feeling this could be the finish until after the Christmas, New Year break.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not looking good, people are too busy doing administration work or visiting their customers to do fresh business,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Traders said the only possible excitement in the market could be Thursday's European Union tender, but they half expected it to be a non-event.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't see the Commission doing much on Thursday, they may try and tease us a bit, but at the end of the day I think it will be a damp squib,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>In light trading feed wheat traded at 100.50 stg a tonne for March fob ex-east coast ports.</p>
<p>Buyers were seeking February feed wheat at 99.75 stg with sellers around 100 stg. Apr/Jun was offered at 102 stg with a bid of 101.50 against it.</p>
<p>Delivered traded levels were around 0.50 stg down with 99 stg paid for feed wheat in Tilbury and 98.50 stg in the Avon six range.</p>
<p>Feed barley fetched 100.50 stg a tonne on the south coast while 98.50 stg was paid in Bridgewater.</p>
<p>There were no reported trades for milling wheat.</p>
