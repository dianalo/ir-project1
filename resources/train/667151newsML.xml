<headline>GM, UAW pact averts Wisconsin strike - union.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1997-06-17</dateline>

<p>The United Auto Workers and General Motors Corp. averted what could have been a crippling strike at its Oak Creek, Wis., parts plant by reaching agreement on a contract, the union said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Details of the pact, achieved after all-night bargaining, were not available, but the company and the union said in a joint statement that the agreement includes long-term job security provisions</p>
<p>A spokesman for UAW Local 1866, representing about 900 workers at the plant near Milwaukee, said a ratification vote was set for Sunday.</p>
<p>The Oak Creek plant manufactures catalytic converters for exhaust systems fitted on nearly all of GM's North American car and truck models. A shutdown could have sent ripples across the automaker's assembly lines within days.</p>
<p>Last week, the union local extended a midnight Thursday strike deadline &quot;hour by hour&quot; to continue negotiations, which went through the night and ended Tuesday morning, a GM spokesman said.</p>
<p>Negotiations at Oak Creek and at an important metal-stamping plant in Grand Rapids, Mich., focused on disputes over staffing levels, the shifting of work to outside suppliers and long-term business plans.</p>
<p>Talks continued at the Grand Rapids plant, which employs 2,346 workers. UAW Local 730 had extended a midnight Friday deadline indefinitely while negotiations continued there.</p>
<p>GM reached a tentative agreement late Friday for a new local labour contract at a foundry in Saginaw, Mich., averting a threatened strike by about 900 members of UAW Local 445. The foundry produces pistons, piston rods and transmission parts for a variety of GM vehicles.</p>
<p>Negotiations continued slowly on ending a two-month strike by 5,800 workers at GM's pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Mich. UAW Local 594 began a strike there April 22 over demands for more jobs to ease an increasing workload. Initial demands by the union called for GM to hire 600 new workers at the full-size pickup truck plant and related truck-development facilities.</p>
<p>GM has resisted, saying it needs to reduce its work force to more competitive levels.</p>
<p>Some analysts view the multiple strike deadlines set by the UAW as a move by the union to increase pressure for GM to settle the Pontiac walkout.</p>
<p>GM, which has been plagued by troublesome local negotiations more than eight months after it reached a national labour pact with the UAW, also has several other unresolved local disputes, including one at a midsize car plant in Fairfax, Kan.</p>
<p>The world's largest automaker has suffered five local strikes so far this year.</p>
