<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- Russian Michail Botvinov, competing for Austria, took first place in the Vasalopp, the world's longest cross-country skiing race which was held on Sunday in Mora, Sweden.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- Volvo Cars managing director Tuve Johannesson said in an interview that with annual sales of 500,000 cars the company would not need any alliances with other vehicle makers. An analysis by the newspaper showed the company needed to have a sustainable profit level of six billion crowns. Johannesson said the company would probably achieve about this level, but that the figure should not be seen as a forecast.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- Only three newspapers increased their sales in 1996, one of the worst years for the newspaper business in the past decade. Sales of Aftonbladet, Dagens Industri and Sydsvenska Dagbladet rose while for 131 other newspapers they fell.</p>
<p>- The government is investigating new state support for Sweden's wharfs which ended in the 1980s.</p>
