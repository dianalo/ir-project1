<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.African stock market closing report.</title>
<headline>S.African stock market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-01-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>South African industrial shares ended a quiet Tuesday weak, knocked down by futures trades, dealers said. Golds were flat amid a lack of interest on the ailing bullion price.</p>
<p>Dealers said weak European markets also dented sentiment in local shares.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been some arbitrage business, that is buying the future and selling the equity. There's been good buying at the lower levels,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the pain is from European stocks. The FTSE is down half a percent and the German stocks are also lower,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Volumes were fairly large and there was a little nervousness ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony on the U.S. economy on Tuesday night. But most dealers played down any possible negative impact of his speech.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the market is that worried on Greenspan. It does not seem like he will fiddle with the interest rates,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The market was seen looking to Greenpan's comment's and how they affect Wall Street for direction on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Golds were ignored and foreigners took no interest in the gold counter but the index held up well, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said Randgold's shares were rising ahead of their fourth quarter results due on Monday. Dealers said they were anticipating good results.  </p>
<p>The overall index fell 38.7 points to 6,738.7 points, the industrial index shed 63.9 points to 8,113.9 points and the gold index was unchanged from Monday's closing level of 1,419.1.</p>
<p>De Beers added 25 cents to 135.50 rand, Anglo dropped 75 cents to 257.50 rand, Sappi lost 210 cents to 42 rand and SA Breweries lost 125.50 rand. Dries added five cents to 43.15 rand.</p>
<p>Shares in Vestacor, the pyramid holding firm for Mathieson &amp; Ashley (M&amp;A), jumped 55 percent, or 22 cents, on speculative buying after the Johannesburg Stock Exchange approved a rescue bid by a consortium.</p>
<p>M&amp;A also leapt 22.22 percent, or 10 cents, to 55 cents. Analysts said interest was mainly speculation and the companies were not investment quality yet.  </p>
<p>Near-dated equity futures ended soft in nervous trade ahead of Greenspan's speech. Golds ended slightly firmer on a bullion price making some gains in late trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was a lot of selling after two weeks of gains in the market. They said Wall Street was beginning to look toppish and could come off. Futures were seen opening weak on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The March all-share contract stood at 6,230/55 from 6,283, the industrial contract was at 7,920/38 from 8,026 and the gold contract is at 1,000/15 from 1,000.</p>
