<headline>Nigeria slaps curfew on troubled oil town, reports.</headline>
<dateline>LAGOS, Nigeria 1997-03-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Nigeria's military government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the midwest oil town of Warri after protesters this week held hostage Shell workers and occupied oil installations outside the town, local newspapers reported.</p>
<p>The Guardian on Saturday quoted Colonel John Dungs, military administrator of Delta state, as saying in a radio and television broadcast on Friday night that the curfew, which takes immediate effect, would be until further notice.</p>
<p>Warri, dubbed Jungle City, because of its chaotic traffic, rampant crime and crowded roads, is a part of Delta state. It is also headquarters of Royal Dutch/Shell's operations in the Western region.</p>
<p>&quot;Businesses should shut down and residents be off the streets from seven pm to six am daily,&quot; the independent Thisday quoted Dungs as saying.</p>
<p>Riots by Ijaw and Itsekiri youths in the town for most of the week resulted in the death of three Ijaw tribesmen while the home of an Ijaw leader, a former Nigerian information minister, was burnt down.</p>
<p>&quot;Government will not fold its arms and allow terrorism in any part of the state. Law enforcement agents have stern directive to summarily deal with anyone who wants to dare the government,&quot; Dungs said.</p>
<p>Trouble started last Saturday when Ijaw tribesmen seized Shell's oil flow stations in the swamps outside Warri, stopped oil production and held the company's 127 Nigerian staff hostage to protest at the military authorities' relocation of their local government headquarters from Ijaw area.</p>
<p>All the hostages were freed, the last batch on Thursday, after negotiations with leaders of the communities.</p>
<p>Dungs said government would examine the grievances of the affected communities.</p>
<p>The company said on Friday it would send a team to assess the state of facilities in the flow stations to enable it to determine when to resume operations.</p>
