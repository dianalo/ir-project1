<p>Tokyo stocks ended on a somewhat feeble note on Thursday, following a surge of over 3.5 percent on the previous day, as there were few factors to sustain the rise, brokers said. Eyes were glued to the weak yen, with speculation on what could happen should it weaken further.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 was 104.42 points or 0.58 percent lower at 17,909.46. Its March futures were 150 points lower at 17,910.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade was very cautious today as many investors are anxious to see if the yen will fall further and whether it sparks foreign investor selling or not,&quot; a &quot;Big Four&quot; broker said.</p>
