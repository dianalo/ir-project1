<p>Participants in the market were generally inclined to leave prices unchanged until they see a further auction test of wool values this week.</p>
<p>The latest Australian tendency was firmer and stockpile sales supported an impression of sound demand. But this only applied to finer wool, with coarser crossbreds still neglected and New Zealand prices in this sector close to, if not at, their lowest of the current selling season.</p>
<p>New business being placed in the UK and Europe is mostly said to be limited in quantity with buyers only ready to pay highly competitive prices. The view that new business will come through as old orders are absorbed remains theoretical rather than a fact for most firms.</p>
<p>Currency is closely watched as are any factors likely to point to higher interest rates in the UK or United States and a consequent firming by sterling or the dollar.</p>
<p>A new suggestion that the remaining Australian stockpile may be acquired by a single buyer is disturbing to firms relying on this as a steady source of supply.</p>
