<p>Denmark, which rejected the European Union's planned monetary union in a 1992 referendum, may also consult voters on planned reforms of the 15-nation bloc, Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Petersen said there could be a Danish referendum on the outcome of the EU's intergovernmental conference (IGC), a series of discussions on the bloc's future which includes institutional reforms to pave the way for its expansion into eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Petersen said referenda &quot;express the will of the people and I think that sometimes is a good way of deciding things.&quot;</p>
<p>He told Reuters after a summit of EU leaders in Dublin that it would be unwise to make any decisions just yet about calling a national vote on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is absolutely a possibility that Denmark will have a referendum after the conclusion of the IGC,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The IGC, which began last March, is due to conclude in June 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;In a referendum, anything can happen, we know that, but I think there would be very good chances of winning the support of the people for a policy that would mean the enlargement of the EU,&quot; Petersen said.</p>
<p>The Danes rejected the EU's Maastricht Treaty in the 1992 referendum but accepted it in a 1993 vote after winning opt-outs from key EU areas such as monetary union, defence and citizenship and police arrangements.</p>
<p>Petersen said Denmark had problems with the draft proposal on the IGC put forward by current EU president Ireland, notably its proposals on the role of the European Commission in foreign trade.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't believe it is a good idea to give the Commission competences when it comes to negotiations on services,&quot; Petersen said. &quot;So here is one example where the Irish have gone too far, too soon and we have told them that.&quot;</p>
