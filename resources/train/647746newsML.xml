<headline>Dollar/yen off lows as Japan calls for stability.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-09</dateline>

<p>The dollar steadied above six-month lows against the yen after Japanese officials tried to offset concern about trade relations between the U.S. and Japan by stressing their desire for stable exchange rates.</p>
<p>Speculation Japan's trade surplus will be discussed by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations next week drove the dollar down more than two yen in Asia as low as 111.80, its weakest since November 25, 1996.</p>
<p>U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky sparked such concern after she said Friday the U.S. was concerned about the potential for a rise in Japan's trade surplus with the U.S..  </p>
<p>&quot;Barshefsky's comments gave no new fundamantal insight but were timely as they reminded the markets about the natural focus on trade ahead of the G-7 meeting,&quot; said Paul Meggyesi, a currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Japanese officials quickly stepped in to limit the damage by calling for currency stability. Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said Japan will do its utmost to achieve currency stability. His deputy, Tadashi Ogawa, said he hoped for stable currency trading and that he was not aware that Japan's trade surplus would become a specific focus at the G-7 meeting in Denver between June 20-22.  </p>
<p>Dollar/mark took centre stage at midday in Europe, though, after an European Union source said France wanted to consult its National Assembly before approving the Emaastricht treaty's budget stability pact.</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn confirmed an accord on the pact would not be reached Monday and that he would need more than a week to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>This triggered concern that the planned European single currency won't be launched on schedule in 1999 and spurred traders to buy marks for other European currencies and the dollar.  </p>
<p>Concern about a possible delay to EMU persisted even though Strauss-Kahn and other EU officials added that the pact would not be renegotiated and stressed their commitment to launching the single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;A delay in ratifying the stability accord could lead to delays elsewhere, and could be used to delay the whole project,&quot; said Teis Knuthsen, the international economist at First Chicago. &quot;This is bullish for the mark, and we can already see the results in dollar/mark and on the European crosses.&quot;</p>
<p>The mark rose to 3.3819/24 French francs and 988.50/80 lire from 3.3763/66 and 986.00/30 Friday.  </p>
<p>Traders expect the dollar to stabilize against the mark for the time being, awaiting further developments on the stability pact.</p>
<p>The focus could therefore return to dollar/yen, which is expected by traders to push lower ahead of the G-7 meeting, particularly if U.S. data confirms a slowdown in the pace of growth and dampens hopes of an increase in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>New York Federal Reserve President William McDonough said Monday U.S. growth would likely slow in the second quarter of 1997 and that the jobs data Friday was not a cause for concern. -Swaha Pattanaik, London Forex Desk, 44 171 542 6284</p>
