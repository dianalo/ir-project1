<p>Polish inflation fell more than expected to 14.6 percent year-on-year in May and analysts were upbeat on future figures but most said credit action was likely to prevent the central bank from cutting interest rates soon.</p>
<p>The Central Statistical Office (GUS) said on Monday that consumer prices grew 0.6 percent in May, against one-percent growth in April when the year-on-year rate was 15.3 percent.</p>
<p>Prices rose 6.6 percent in the January-May period, compared with a 10.3 percent rise in the corresponding period in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;If the National Bank of Poland (central bank) lowered interest rates we could forget about reducing the pace of credit growth...and I wouldn't count on it (a rate-cut) before the fourth quarter,&quot; said Krzysztof Rybinski of ING Bank.</p>
<p>Credit grew 13.3 percent to 10.7 billion zlotys in the first five months of the year. Personal credit was up 19.8 percent to 2.3 billion in the January-May period, despite a very restrictive monetary policy and high real rates.</p>
<p>Poland's broad money rose by 3.5 billion zlotys, or 2.4 percent, in May to 148 billion after a 2.3 percent rise in April. It grew 9.2 percent in the January-May period against 10.5 percent in the same period of last year.</p>
<p>Analysts said consumer price inflation was likely to keep gradually falling for the remainder of the year to end close to the government's 13 percent price growth target, helped by a probable food price fall in the summer season.</p>
<p>&quot;The finance minister will always be more optimistic about inflation than banks, but year-on-year 14 percent is possible, as is single digit price growth in 1998,&quot; said Jacek Lech, deputy chief dealer at Bank Handlowy SA.</p>
<p>Finance minister Marek Belka said earlier on Monday that the government may even revise down its inflation target for December of this year from 13 percent.</p>
<p>A monthly Reuter poll of the 26 biggest banks showed their average prediction for year-on-year inflation at the end of 1997 was 14.62 percent, down from 14.93 percent predicted last month.</p>
<p>Some analysts said inflation might still rebound in the fourth quarter due to fast wage growth and possible food prices increases later in the year.</p>
<p>Many analysts said the central bank was right to keep interest rates on hold to curb fast credit growth and reduce the widening foreign trade gap.</p>
<p>Others said, however, that a wide spread between inflation and official interest rates should prompt the central bank to cut rates.</p>
<p>&quot;I think such a large discrepancy between the tempo of price growth and interest rates on deposits and credits cannot be maintained any longer,&quot; said Tadeusz Chroscicki, chief analyst at the government-linked Centre for Strategic Studies.</p>
<p>Chroscicki said he expected a rate-cut of about two percentage points within the next several months.</p>
<p>Poland's official rates, at 25 percent for the Lombard and 22 percent for the discount rate, have not been reduced since July 1996, when year-on-year inflation stood at 20.4 percent.</p>
