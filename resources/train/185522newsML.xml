<p>Pen pictures of the Juventus players most likely to appear in Sunday's serie A clash with AC Milan at the Delle Alpi stadium in Turin.</p>
<p>Angelo Peruzzi, goalkeeper, 26. Italy's first choice goalkeeper. Was suspended for a year in 1990 after he and then Roma team mate Andrea Carnevale tested positive for amphetamines. Played 16 serie A matches for Roma.</p>
<p>Moreno Torricelli, defender, 26. Long-haired former carpenter discovered as amateur by Juventus in 1992. Tough. capable of moving forward to good effect. Recently returned from injury and struggling to find form. Was outstanding for Juventus in European Cup final and has been in Italy squad.</p>
<p>Alessio Tacchinardi, defender, 21. Product of Juventus youth team. Started as midfielder but switched to sweeper by coach Marcello Lippi where he was instantly hailed as &quot;heir to Franco Baresi&quot;. Suffered alarming loss of form after disastrous debut for Italy a year ago. Recovery hampered by injury. If he plays against Milan, will be first full league match of season.</p>
<p>Sergio Porrini, defender, 28. Signed from Genoa in 1993 but only made his mark last season. Equally at home as raiding full-back or central defender.</p>
<p>Mark Iuliano, defender, 23. Yet to start a league match for Juventus since being signed in close season from second division Salernitana.</p>
<p>Angelo Di Livio, midfielder, 30. Current Italian international who was born in Rome and started at Roma. He moved on after one season without a full serie A match. Then spent nine years in second and third divisions before joining Juventus in 1994 and helping them win league title in 1995.</p>
<p>Didier Deschamps, midfielder, 28. The key link with French international team mate Zinedine Zidane. Third season at Juventus. Won European Cup with Marseille as well. Juventus reportedly close to selling him after first season but has developed impressively under coach Marcello Lippi.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane, midfielder, 24. Arrived this season from Bordeaux with tag of &quot;new Michel Platini&quot;. The honeymoon has not lasted and Zidane has had a rough start to season. But he has come good in recent matches, showing good understanding with Alen Boksic and Alessandro Del Piero. Superb long-range shot.</p>
<p>Vladimir Jugovic, midfielder, 27. Former Red Star Belgrade and Sampdoria player. Skilful ball-winner who likes to get forward into shooting positions. Also won European Cup with Red Star in 1991.</p>
<p>Alessandro Del Piero, striker, 22. Future face of Juve who recognised him as natural replacement for Roberto Baggio, offering him contract until year 2000. Handicapped by military service last season, now recovering from injury and starting to show his best form. Deadly from free-kicks on edge of area. Third all-time scorer for Juve in European Cup with eight goals.</p>
<p>Michele Padovano, striker, 30. Juve's top scorer with three goals this season. Formerly with Genoa and Napoli, probably most under-rated striker in serie A, certainly the fastest. Deadly on counter-attack. Scored winner against Real Madrid in 1995 European Cup quarter-final.</p>
<p>Alen Boksic, striker, 26. Coming good after three frustrating years at Lazio. Immensely powerful son of a Croatian truck driver from Split, started out at Hajduk before moving to France. Four goals in Champions' League this season but just once in league where he has shown old Lazio habit of making more goals than he scores. Already tipped as front-runner for player of the year award.</p>
<p>Christian Vieri, striker, 23. Italian who learnt his football in Australia before playing for Venice and Atalanta. Bought by Juventus in close season to replace Gianluca Vialli. Has the physique but not the finesse. Out of favour after falling out with Lippi. One goal in Champions' League.</p>
