<p>Amnesty International said on Friday it deplored an Israeli Supreme Court decision authorising the country's security service to use physical pressure on a man accused of having information on Islamic Jihad bomb attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel is a state party to United Nations treaties which outlaw torture under all circumstances. This shocking decision negates Israel's solemn obligations,&quot; the human rights group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israel's Supreme Court on Thursday overturned an order by a lower court forbidding the General Security Service, known as Shin Bet, from using physical pressure against Muhammad Hamdan.</p>
<p>Hamdan, a student, is accused of knowing about some of the bomb attacks in which scores of Israelis have been killed or wounded since the Palestine Liberation Organisation signed a peace deal with Israel in 1993.</p>
<p>He is suspected of being a member of Islamic Jihad, one of a number of guerrilla groups which have claimed responsibility for suicide bomb attacks.</p>
<p>Amnesty said it had for years been concerned that regulations governing the operations of Shin Bet &quot;effectively allow the use of torture&quot; against people detained in prison.</p>
<p>But since 1994, a special Israeli ministerial committee had allowed increased physical pressure against them, it said.</p>
<p>Shin Bet officers had admitted in court cases to using methods such as violent shaking, which had already led to one death, prolonged sleep deprivation, and forcing detainees to remain in uncomfortable positions for long periods of time.</p>
<p>&quot;While admitting these methods are used, the Israeli Government denies they constitute torture. Amnesty International does not agree,&quot; the organisation said.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has effectively legalised torture...We are calling on our members, particularly those of the legal and medical profession, throughout the world to protest against this.&quot;</p>
