<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai arrived in Jordan on Tuesday for talks with King Hussein on the troubled Middle East peace process, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said Mordechai was met on arrival by Jordan's deputy chief of staff Mohammad al-Huwayan before driving off to a meeting with Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti.</p>
<p>Mordechai, who held crisis talks on Monday night with Palestinian cabinet minister Yasser Abed Rabbo over Israel's unilateral plans for troop redeployment in the West Bank, was due to meet King Hussein later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Abed Rabbo spoke of a deepening Israeli-Palestinian crisis after his late night meeting with Mordechai.</p>
<p>Palestinians have spurned an Israeli decision to hand over nine percent of the West Bank to PLO rule, saying it is too little. They were already angered by Israeli plans to build Jewish homes in Arab East Jerusalem and to close four Palestinian offices in the disputed city.</p>
<p>The latest tension is likely to overshadow Mordechai's talks with King Hussein, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. The two men had been expected to discuss military cooperation and security along their joint borders, Israeli diplomats said.</p>
