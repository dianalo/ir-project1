<p>Republican presidential challenger Bob Dole branded President Bill Clinton on Tuesday as &quot;an old-style, dyed-in-the-wool, big-spending liberal&quot; who would raise taxes on families while Dole promised to cut them.</p>
<p>In a speech before business people in the nation's auto capital, Dole combined an attack on his front-running opponent with a promotion of his own economic plan centred on tax cuts, including a 15 percent income tax rate cut, capital gains tax cuts and a $500 a child tax credit.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is under our plan, a family of four making $30,000 will save $1,261,&quot; Dole said. &quot;To some people that doesn't sound like a lot of money. But this is designed for Main Street, not Wall Street.&quot;</p>
<p>Dole, lagging by double digits in his uphill race against Clinton, spoke before several thousand people at the Economic Club of Detroit at Cobo Hall, the same complex area where Republican Ronald Reagan was nominated for president 16 years ago and later won election partly on a plan to cut taxes across the board 25 percent over three years.</p>
<p>In pushing his tax-cut proposals, Dole was trying to put a spark into his economic plan that public opinion polls show has not caught fire with most voters just six weeks before the presidential election Nov. 5.</p>
<p>But Dole did not spell out in any detail how he would pay for the $548 billion in tax cuts and still carry out his pledge to balance the budget by the year 2002.</p>
<p>He suggested it could be done by stimulating economic growth and by cutting five cents out of every dollar in spending as well as selling government property.</p>
<p>As he has for three days now, Dole portrayed Clinton as a liberal promoting conservative policies for the election but who would propose big spending programmes and taxes if elected.</p>
<p>During Clinton's term, Dole said, he has proposed programmes that would cost some $2 trillion and tax increases.</p>
<p>&quot;These are not the actions of a finger-in-the-wind politician,&quot; said Dole. &quot;These are the actions of an old-styled, dyed-in-the-wool, big spending liberal committed to a government that spends and spend and taxes and taxes.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, &quot;These are the actions of someone who -- once the spotlight of the campaign has been turned off -- will take every opportunity to increase the size of government -- even as he decreases the size of your wallet.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton denied on Monday he is a &quot;closet liberal&quot; and pointed to his record going back to governor of Arkansas.</p>
<p>But Dole contended Clinton has a &quot;tax and spend agenda&quot; and pointed to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's proposal for a sales tax on outdoor equipment for outdoor recreation areas.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a new tax on sport-utility vehicles,&quot; Dole told his audience including auto executives. &quot;I don't have to tell you here in Detroit what that means. That's a tax on some of your most  popular lines -- the Ford Explorer, the Chevy Blazer and the Jeep Cherokee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He (Clinton) wants families to pinch their pennies so government can spend more of their money,&quot; Dole said. &quot;I want government to pinch its pennies so families won't have to.&quot;</p>
<p>Dole countered Clinton's claim that Dole can't cut taxes and balance the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;I reject the words 'it can't be done,'&quot; said Dole who said it can be done and claimed &quot;our plan protects vital programmes such as Medicare, Social Security and defence.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton holds solid leads in recent polls in Michigan and two other key states, Ohio and Missouri, that Dole has on his two-day travelling schedule and which Republicans need to win.</p>
