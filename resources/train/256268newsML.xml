<headline>UK Labour by-election win costs Major his majority.</headline>

<p>Britain's opposition Labour Party on Thursday scored a runaway victory in a parliamentary by-election that further weakened Prime Minister John Major's grip on power.</p>
<p>Labour's triumph in the election in the Barnsley East constituency in northern England -- a Labour stronghold -- ensured that the Conservatives no longer command a majority in parliament for the first time in 17 years.</p>
<p>The new blow to Major's embattled Conservatives came as the party faced deep internal divisions over relations with the European Union and trailed badly in opinion polls.</p>
<p>Labour local council leader Jeff Ennis won 14,683 votes against 1,299 for Conservative Jane Ellison, who finished third to Liberal Democrat candidate David Willis with 1,502.</p>
<p>Turnout was just over 33 percent of the electorate of about 53,000.</p>
<p>Ennis was defending a Labour majority of 24,777 votes won by his predecessor Terry Patchett, whose recent death led to the by-election.</p>
<p>The by-election was one of the last tests of public opinion before the next general election -- which must be called by May -- but the run-down, working-class constituency has long voted left of centre and is not typical of the nation at large.</p>
<p>Ennis said after his victory: &quot;Tonight's result in Barnsley East should be seen as a springboard to Labour victory in a general election.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour Party leader Tony Balir said: &quot;The government majority has gone and we will continue to pile on the pressure until the government has gone too.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour has however made clear it will not move immediately to a confidence vote in parliament, where Major can count on the support of nine pro-British Northern Ireland Ulster Unionists.</p>
<p>The result nevertheless deepened Major's problems, coming days after he effectively lost his majority in parliament when a disgruntled Conservative MP, Sir John Gorst, withdrew support.</p>
<p>Even if Gorst is still formally counted as a Conservative, the party's 323 voting members of parliament are now evenly matched by legislators sitting for opposition parties.</p>
