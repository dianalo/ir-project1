<title>INDIA: Indian budget impact on leading companies - paper.</title>
<headline>Indian budget impact on leading companies - paper.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Economic Times newspaper on Saturday analysed the impact of India's 1997/98 (April-March) federal budget on several companies.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from the newspaper of the impact of Friday's budget announcements.</p>
<p>(The opinions expressed in this report reflect the views of the Economic Times newspaper. They should not be taken as reflecting the views of Reuters).</p>
<p>**  Associated Cement Companies **</p>
<p>The largest cement producer, ACC is the only major gainer from tax reductions. No major gain from coal imports. Excise duty cuts will not help much either. Major capacity additions in deficit areas and an all India presence will drive profits.</p>
<p>**  Arvind Mills **</p>
<p>Arvind Mills is the largest exporter of denims and its export income will benefit from tax exemption. The excise duty on synthetic and manmade yarn will improve margins though the effect would be marginal as it is primarily into cotton fabrics.</p>
<p>**  Bajaj Auto **</p>
<p>The drop in the custom duty by five percent in steel is not expected to have much impact on Bajaj as this drop is offset by the increase in the freight charges by 12 percent. Drop in the corporate taxes and the capital goods tax can have a positive impact.</p>
<p>**  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd **</p>
<p>Reduction in customs duty by one percent will make business environment more competitive. Though duty cuts will not affect the company too much, as domestic suppliers are given a price preference, competitive pricing may yield lower margins.</p>
<p>**  Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Ltd **</p>
<p>BSES will gain on account of the reduced import duty on coal. However, being a zero tax company, MAT will take a substantial toll on it worth 200 million rupees. Added to this will be the dividend burden of 35 million rupees.</p>
<p>**  Grasim **</p>
<p>Based on 1995/96 financials, the company would have had 140 million more as profits after adjusting for lower tax rates and the outflow due to dividend. Thus, a major gainer on the tax front. Otherwise, quite uneventful.</p>
<p>**  Gujarat Ambuja Cements **</p>
<p>This low-cost producer and largest exporter will benefit from customs cut in coal as it imports heavily. Recent freight hike will not affect it too much as most of the transportation is by its own truck fleet and by sea.</p>
<p>**  Hindalco **</p>
<p>Being the highest tax payer, it is the biggest beneficiary of cuts in taxes. Firming LME prices, increase in customs duty on wrought aluminium by 10 percent, new capacity addition, low production cost and rising demand-supply gap will ensure more profits.  </p>
<p>**  Hindustan Lever Ltd **</p>
<p>HLL straddles the soap and detergents segment. Lower excise duties once again on inputs and the end products will increase its penetration of rural areas. Toothpastes will get cheaper.</p>
<p>**  Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd **</p>
<p>Customs duty on LAB has been slashed by 10 percent. No relief has been given on raw materials or finished products. Scenario for IPCL, thus, does not change much. Reduction in MAT will help the bottomline.</p>
<p>**  ITC Ltd **</p>
<p>Has been hit by a nearly 15 percent hike in excise duty. Past few years the below 60mm segment had been the growth area for the industry. However, the mini-segment is a small and increasingly price inelastic segment. ITC will also save on corporate tax.</p>
<p>**  Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd **</p>
<p>No dramatic changes in the fortunes of the major divisions. Increased competition from imports and large tax liability due to high dividends are the major features. Marginally compensated by the lower tax rate. Thus not a very rosy budget.</p>
<p>**  Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd **</p>
<p>Tractor segment is expected to reap riches of the increased credit flow of 66 billion rupees to the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>Around 25 percent of this increased flow is expected to flow towards tractors and farm equipment. The increased excise on utility vehicles is not expected to have much impact.</p>
<p>**  MTNL **</p>
<p>Positive impact on the company as the equipment used by the company becomes cheaper. As the company has been tax in the past the company gets benefit in reduction of corporate tax rate and abolition of the surcharge.</p>
<p>**  Nestle India Ltd **</p>
<p>Adverse impact. Some products like sauces, soups to be taxed but fall in excise duties on instant coffee and tea may offset the loss. Cut in tax rate to have marginal impact as tax on dividends will be high.</p>
<p>**  Ranbaxy Laboratories **</p>
<p>The customs duty on raw materials -- organic chemicals -- has been reduced which should bring down their cost. With the duty increased on bulk drugs, the company can avail of full modvat benefits on excise paid for inputs.</p>
<p>**  Reliance Industries Ltd **</p>
<p>Reliance is a major gainer. Reduction in excise on polyester by 11.5 percent will be a big boost. Coupled with better margins, turnover will rise. Petrochemicals will remain unaffected. Reduction in MAT will help bottomline.</p>
<p>**  Steel Authority of India Ltd **</p>
<p>The company has been hit by reduction of customs duty on Cold Rolled Coils. The reduction in customs duty on coke, coal and nickle will help the company in reducing costs but this is offset by an increase in freight costs.</p>
<p>**  Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive Company Ltd **</p>
<p>There has not been much change on the excise and customs duties front for heavy and medium commercial vehicles. However there has been an increase in the excise duty by 5 percent for its utility range of vehicles. Hence not much impact.</p>
<p>**  Tata Iron &amp; Steel Company Ltd **</p>
<p>The reduction in the customs duty on coke and coal will not affect the cost of the company as it has captive sources. Increase in the freight cost might affect the company adversely. The non-reduction of customes duty on Hot Rolled Coils will help.</p>
