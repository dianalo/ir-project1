<headline>US, Britain urge checks on biological weapons pact.</headline>

<p>The United States said on Tuesday that the threat posed by biological weapons was growing and 12 countries -- including Russia, China and Iraq -- were suspected of having active biological weapons systems in various stages.</p>
<p>John Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, called for reaching agreement by 1998 to carry out international inspections of countries suspected of cheating on a 1972 global treaty banning biological weapons.</p>
<p>But any verification measures, which would also cover private laboratories, should protect the commercial secrets of pharmaceutical and biogenetic industries, according to Holum.</p>
<p>He spoke to a news conference after addressing a plenary session of representatives in Geneva from the 138 countries which have ratified the Convention on Biological Weapons.</p>
<p>Delegates are looking at how to boost compliance with the pact, under which states pledge never to develop, produce or acquire microbial or other biological agents or toxins.</p>
<p>&quot;In general terms, we believe roughly a dozen countries may have an active biological weapons programme,&quot; Holum said, adding that this was twice the number suspected in the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously those concerns give us strong incentives, and should give strong incentives to the entire international community, to negotiate this protocol,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Holum declined to list all 12 countries, but named seven which appeared in his agency report to the U.S. Congress earlier this year: China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Russia and Syria.</p>
<p>China's disarmament ambassador Sha Zukang, speaking at a seminar on Monday, said Beijing fully complied with the pact.</p>
<p>Holum, in a speech to delegates, criticised Iraq for failing to fully disclose the scope of its biological weapons programme to UNSCOM (United Nations Special Commission).</p>
<p>&quot;Iraq's successive &quot;full, final and complete' disclosures -- each one proving the dishonesty of its predecessors -- give good cause to treat the Iraqi programme as an active menace.</p>
<p>&quot;It is essential for UNSCOM to be able to complete its work and certify that the programme has in fact been eradicated and discrepancies in information have been fully explained.&quot;</p>
<p>Holum praised Russian President Boris Yeltsin for having acknowledged and renounced in 1992 the offensive biological weapons programme Moscow inherited from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But the U.S. arms control official added: &quot;The challenge to demonstrate full eradication of that programme still remains.&quot;</p>
<p>A special trilateral committee, composed of officials from Britain, Russia and the United States, was trying ensure that Yeltsin's orders have been carried out, according to Holum.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a very widespread consensus that the time has come to complete this protocol,&quot; Holum said.</p>
<p>&quot;Not everyone will sign up to the same timetable, but I think everyone understands that the absence of a compliance structure for the BWC is a serious omission.</p>
<p>The lack of an inspection regime for biological weapons stood out even more since the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty were agreed, Holum said.</p>
<p>Britain is chairing the two-week talks, the treaty's fourth regular review conference, which began on Monday.</p>
