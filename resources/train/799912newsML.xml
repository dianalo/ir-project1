<p>Pakistan celebrated its 50th anniversary of independence on Thursday, but the festive mood was soured by crowd trouble at a rally in Karachi.</p>
<p>Two people were killed by gunfire and a score injured in a stampede after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif addressed a crowd of about 20,000 at the marble mausoleum of the Islamic state's founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, in the southern port city.</p>
<p>Pakistan's celebrations took place a day before those in arch-rival India, the Hindu-majority state also carved from the British raj in the bloody 1947 partition of the sub-continent.</p>
<p>At the stroke of midnight on August 14-15, 1947, more than two centuries of British colonial rule over the vast subcontinent came to an end and two new nations emerged.</p>
<p>As India prepared for a lavish golden jubilee, suspected separatists exploded a bomb on a train track in the northeastern state of Assam, killing seven people and wounding eight.</p>
<p>It was the latest attack in a mounting campaign of insurgency-related violence in the region, where dozens of separatist groups are fighting Indian rule.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, Sharif used a flag-raising ceremony in Islamabad to issue a fresh call for peace with India and a solution to the 50-year-old Kashmir dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that India would also respond with the same sincerity by withdrawing its forces from occupied Kashmir and putting an end to atrocities there and hence pave the way for establishment of lasting peace in the region,&quot; he declared.</p>
<p>He earlier told the National Assembly (lower house) that Pakistan would provide continued moral support for Kashmiris fighting Indian rule. &quot;Our independence will be complete on the day all our Kashmiri brethren join us in celebrating independence,&quot; the prime minister declared.</p>
<p>Pakistan, which holds one-third of the Himalayan region, denies Indian accusations that it arms, trains and finances the guerrillas in mainly Moslem Kashmir, whose insurgency has cost an estimated 20,000 lives since it erupted in 1990.</p>
<p>There was no immediate Indian reaction to Sharif's peace call, but the government accused Pakistan of developing nuclear warheads for medium-range missiles with China's help.</p>
<p>New Delhi has also said Pakistan may have deployed M-11 ballistic missiles near the Indian border.</p>
<p>A lawmaker in the upper house asked Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral in writing if the government was &quot;aware of Pakistan's developing of nuclear warheads for its medium-range missiles with active technical assistance from China&quot;.</p>
<p>Junior Foreign Minister Saleem Iqbal Shervani responded in a written answer released by parliament on Thursday: &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week, India accused China of supplying M-11 missiles to Pakistan and helping its arch-foe build a missile factory.</p>
<p>It was believed to be the first time India had openly accused China of supplying M-11 missiles to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan and China have denied reports of missile transfers, dismissing fears voiced in the United States and India.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan, both now regarded as threshold nuclear powers, have fought three wars since 1947. They launched peace talks in March, but have periodically traded accusations since.</p>
<p>From the start, India and Pakistan have been at loggerheads.</p>
<p>The stark division of the subcontinent into two states was accompanied by the massacre of hundreds of thousands and the uprooting of millions of families. Two months after independence there was war over Kashmir.</p>
