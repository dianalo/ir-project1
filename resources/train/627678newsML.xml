<p>Sweden, concerned at the rise in consumption of so-called &quot;alcopops&quot;, said on Friday it would ask its European Union parners to double taxes on the alcoholic soft drinks to drive them from the beverages market.</p>
<p>&quot;Incredibly cynical marketing methods are being used to get youngsters to start drinking spirits,&quot; Social Affairs Minister Margo Wallstrom told reporters.</p>
<p>Wallstrom said she would seek a change in an EU directive so that the alcopops could be taxed as spirits. At present they are taxed at the same rate as wine and beer. In Sweden such a change would mean a doubling in price.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm thinking of proposing that the EU either bans or limit the marketing that is aimed at children or youngsters or as an alternative to investigate the possiblity of raising taxation on alcoholic soft drinks so that they are at the same level as spirits,&quot; Wallstrom said in a statement.</p>
<p>Wallstrom said she would like to see the drinks, which have been successful among young people, removed altogether. In Sweden they are only sold through the monopoly alcohol retail chain Systembolaget.</p>
<p>The social democratic minister said she would raise at a meeting of EU social ministers next week in Luxembourg the possibility of a total advertising ban on alcopops.</p>
