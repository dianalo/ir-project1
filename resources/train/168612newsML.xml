<title>USA: Coastal Physician's Corman resigns.</title>
<headline>Coastal Physician's Corman resigns.</headline>
<dateline>DURHAM, N.C. 1996-11-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Coastal Physician Group Inc said chief financial officer and director Stephen Corman has resigned in conjunction with a settlement of claims made in a lawsuit against the company, Corman, and others by two Coastal Physician directors.</p>
<p>The settlement, which dismisses all claims against Corman, was approved by Coastal's board Wednesday and further calls for Corman to provide financial consulting services to Coastal over a five-month period.</p>
<p>For the last few months, Coastal has been involved in a proxy battle with former chief executive Steven Scott for control of the company's board.  </p>
<p>Pending court approval, the settlement will be a full resolution of all claims in the lawsuit against Corman.</p>
<p>Coastal named Timothy Trost to serve as chief financial officer following Corman's resignation.</p>
<p>Trost joined Coastal as vice president of corporate development in March 1994 and was named vice president, corporate controller and chief accounting officer in January 1996.</p>
