<p>The number two executive at Mexico's Grupo Televisa SA quit on Monday, having lost a bitter boardroom battle inside the Spanish-speaking world's largest media empire.</p>
<p>The departure of Televisa's Chief Corporate Officer Guillermo Canedo White followed widespread reports of a management split within the media giant since the death in April of patriarch and founding chairman Emilio Azcarraga Milmo.</p>
<p>It was the latest instalment in a months-long drama worthy of the company's trademark soap operas, a behind-the-scenes play that kept investors guessing who would come out on top and the company's share price in check.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel it is best for me to move on and pursue other interests,&quot; Canedo said in a short Televisa statement released in Mexico City late on Monday.</p>
<p>Seen as the financial brains at the firm, Canedo was groomed by Azcarraga Milmo to help his 29-year-old son Emilio Azcarraga Jean lead the company into the next century, but Canedo's fortunes floundered without Azcarraga Milmo's backing.</p>
<p>Instead, Azcarraga Jean consolidated control of the company barely a week after his father's death, replacing Canedo as chairman with the approval of shareholders.</p>
<p>In June, Azcarraga Jean allowed his cousin and Canedo's rival, Alejandro Burrillo, back into the company after a two-year hiatus -- an absence some analysts blamed on an earlier boardroom coup engineered by Canedo and approved by Azcarraga Milmo.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, reports surfaced that Canedo was leaving the company. Burrillo made no effort to play things down, telling the Wall Street Journal recently that Canedo &quot;doesn't have any experience in finance and should be gone.&quot;</p>
<p>But on Wall Street, Canedo had earned a reputation as the man who helped Televisa weather Mexico's 1994-5 financial crisis. A year before Mexico's peso crashed and caused the price of dollar debt here to double, Canedo engineered one of the largest private bank loans in Mexico's history for the company -- in pesos.</p>
<p>Televisa's stock price suffered in recent weeks partly due to the uncertainty. On Monday, Televisa's shares on the Mexican bourse fell 5.75 percent mainly on worries about the company's management troubles and its upcoming quarterly earnings report.</p>
<p>Company officials on Monday played down Canedo's departure, stressing that the remainder of Televisa's team was intact.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot hide the fact there were differences between the two men, although I do not know how much they played a role (in Canedo's exit),&quot; company spokesman Xavier Von Bertrab told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The important thing is that the company's plans ... remain intact. We have made commitments to the marketplace and we will carry them out,&quot; Von Bertrab added, referring to the company's recent Televisa 2000 plan to cut costs and revamp programming.</p>
<p>Analysts said earlier on Monday the company might get a boost once its management saga drew to a close.</p>
<p>&quot;It might be a positive for the company ... people there haven't had much time in the past few months to focus on the core business,&quot; said one company analyst in New York.</p>
<p>The company said it was continuing its search for a chief financial officer and named Raul Lopez Martinez to serve in the role in the interim.</p>
<p>Von Bertrab said about four or five candidates were currently under consideration, including the chief financial officer at Mexican retailer Cifra SA, Gilberto Perezalonso.</p>
