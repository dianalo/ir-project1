<headline>HSBC, Hang Seng down on profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-03-04</dateline>

<p>Shares of HSBC Holdings Plc and Hang Seng Bank Ltd fell on profit-taking on Tuesday after the banks reported strong yearly earnings growth on Monday, brokers said.  </p>
<p>HSBC shares fell as much as HK$4.00 or 2.12 percent to HK$185 in early trade on volume of 939,615 shares before clawing back some ground. At 0300 GMT the stock was at $185.50.</p>
<p>Shares of Hang Seng Bank fell as much as HK$5.50 or 6.18 percent to HK$83.50 in early trade on volume of 1.87 million shares. It had also rebounded slightly by 0300 GMT to $84.50.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors took profits in HSBC after the bank met market expectations of a 25-percent growth in 1996 earnings to HK$37.59 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors were taking profit after the bank posted a profit which was in line with expectation,&quot; said Edwin Cheung, sales manager at Taiwan Securities.</p>
<p>Hang Seng Bank reported a 6.3 percent growth in 1996 annual earnings to HK$8.49 billion on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our estimation was already at the lower end of the market range of 15 to 20 percent, but it turned up much lower than we expected,&quot; said Sean Li, associate director at Amsteel Securities. &quot;Its growth disappointed the market and its provision was also seen higher.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said a higher bad debt position of the bank and a gradual loss of marketshare in the mortgage sector also disappointed investors, and that helped to trigger selling.</p>
