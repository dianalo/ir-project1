<p>Russia, whose President Boris Yeltsin signed a Union Treaty with Belarus on Wednesday, is the biggest state to emerge from the ashes of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It is painfully trying to become a democracy. Russia remains a global power through its sheer size, residual military might and vast natural resources. Here are key facts about it.</p>
<p>TERRITORY: Spanning half the northern hemisphere from the Baltic to the Pacific, Russia's 17.1 million sq km (6.6 million sq miles) make it the world's biggest state. The last European empire, it was built by Muscovite Slavs through centuries of conquest.</p>
<p>PEOPLE: The 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union all but halved the population ruled from Moscow to 147.9 million as Ukraine, Kazakhstan and a dozen other states broke away. Most Russians live west of the Ural mountains. While 85 percent of the Russian Federation's population is ethnic Russian, it is a patchwork of 89 regions and republics. The bloody conflict from December 1994 to August 1996 in the Caucasus region of Chechnya, in which tens of thousands of people were killed, highlighted separatism.</p>
<p>CIS: Moscow maintains great influence in the former Soviet area, partly through the loose regional alliance of 12 members known as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).</p>
<p>NATURAL RESOURCES: Russia could be a huge global fuel source next century with about 49 billion barrels of oil reserves, or five percent of the world's total, and about one-third of the natural gas reserves. Oil, gas, coal, diamonds, gold, platinum, nickel and timber are found in remote parts of Siberia, north of the Arctic Circle and in the Far East. Energy, minerals, metals and timber account for three-quarters of exports.</p>
<p>AGRICULTURE: Russia's farms are still largely organised on a collective system and they barely feed the nation. The 1996 grain harvest was 69.3 million tonnes, one of the worst in 30 years but up from 63.4 million in 1995.</p>
<p>INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE: Russia had an overwhelmingly peasant economy at the time of the 1917 revolution, but 76 percent of Russians now live in towns. The world's biggest privatisation programme ranged from space rockets to supermarkets and the government is encouraging military plants to find civilian markets. Major companies are often grouped into financial-industrial groups, large alliances with interlocking ownership and, often, strong connections in the government.</p>
<p>ECONOMY: Gross domestic product (GDP), or national output, was 2,300 trillion roubles, or $400 billion, in 1996. GDP fell six percent in 1996 and is now about 60 percent of 1991 levels, but the official statistics tend to understate the private sector and a large informal economy. Average wages are around $150 a month, although workers are owed about 50 trillion roubles in back wages. A $10 billion three-year loan from the International Monetary Fund was agreed in February 1996 after the central bank stabilised the rouble and brought down inflation. Inflation this year is projected to be 11-12 percent, against a peak of 2,521 percent in 1992.</p>
<p>CURRENCY: The rouble, officially worth over $1 in 1990, is backed by the Central Bank within a corridor against the dollar. The corridor has helped control inflation. The rouble currently trades at about 5,700 to the dollar.</p>
<p>SOCIETY: Health and social problems are rising, aggravated by unemployment, welfare cuts, violent crime, pollution, poor housing and alcoholism. Male life expectancy is 57, down from 65 in 1986. Russian women -- and Western men -- live to over 70. The gap between rich and poor is widening. &quot;New Russians&quot; drive Mercedes and holiday on the Cote d'Azur. The wealthiest 10 percent of the nation took a quarter of its official income in 1994, up from 19 percent of income three years before. The share of the poorest 20 percent halved, to five percent of official income from 10 percent.</p>
<p>RELIGION: The Russian Orthodox Church, a pillar of the state for 1,000 years before communism, is undergoing a revival. Small areas on the southern fringe and along the Volga are mostly Moslem. The Jewish community, diminished by tsarist pogroms, the Nazi invasion and Communist persecution, is shrinking as thousands leave for Israel.</p>
<p>DEFENCE: Defence Minister Igor Rodionov said in February there were 1.7 million men and women in the armed forces. Russia has the world's second biggest navy and a vast arsenal of land, airborne, naval and submarine nuclear missiles, some 4,000 combat aircraft and 30,000 tanks. It has withdrawn forces from eastern Europe and is scaling down home defences. It strongly opposes NATO membership for ex-Warsaw Pact allies.</p>
<p>POLITICS: Russia is governed under a 1993 constitution which gives broad powers to President Boris Yeltsin, elected for a four-year second term in July 1996. There is also a two-chamber parliament. The government is headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, appointed in December 1992.</p>
