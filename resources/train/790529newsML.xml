<p>Borussia Dortmund's young attacking midfielder Lars Ricken was called into Germany's squad of 22 on Monday for a World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland on August 20.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old, a key figure in Dortmund's European Cup- winning campaign last season despite his tender years, is set to make his senior debut in place of veteran Dieter Eilts for the match in Belfast.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm really pleased. Its recognition for achievement but also motivation for me to improve,&quot; said Ricken, who has graduated from the German under-21 squad.</p>
<p>The dropping of Werder Bremen's Eilts, capped 31 times, surprised some but Germany coach Berti Vogts was unrepentant. &quot;He has been a disappointment recently,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ricken could not be ignored after scoring plenty of goals last season -- some vital and some that were simply impressive.</p>
<p>Of the former, he scored the goals that dumped France's Auxerre out of the European Cup quarter-finals and Manchester United out of the semifinals.</p>
<p>In the final, he scored the third individual goal against Juventus in a 3-1 win -- just 16 seconds after going on a substitute.</p>
<p>Injury-plagued European Footballer of the Year Matthias Sammer will miss Belfast after damaging his knee in Dortmund's season opener against Hertha Berlin.</p>
<p>He had surgery last week for cartilage damage and will be replaced by Karlsruhe's Thomas Haessler, who returns after nine months out due to a fractured left leg.</p>
<p>South African-born striker and club mate Sean Dundee, called up against Ukraine in June, is out.</p>
<p>Vogts kept faith with three Italian-based players -- Juergen Klinsmann at Sampdoria, Christian Ziege at AC Milan and Oliver Bierhoff at Udinese -- despite the fact that the Italian league season does not start until the end of the month.</p>
<p>The game in Belfast will be the first time since 1988 that the national team have competed in a qualifier without a practice game beforehand. Vogts said playing cold was &quot;a compromise which I had to make&quot;.</p>
<p>Germany are second in European group nine, two points behind Ukraine but with two games in hand. They are level with Portugal on points but again have a game in hand.</p>
<p>Vogts was happy with Germany's standing but &quot;not with the way we presented ourselves&quot; and had written to all of his players urging them to fulfil their duty. &quot;I hope very much that all the players will heed my advice,&quot; he said.</p>
