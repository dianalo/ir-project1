<p>IBM and Geotek Communications Inc said on Monday they were expanding their strategic agreement under which IBM is helping Geotek to build commercial mobile radio systems.</p>
<p>Under the accord, IBM will act as prime contractor to develop and supply enhanced features for key elements of Geotek systems, including switching and switching control systems.</p>
<p>The two sides estimated the value of the first phase of the contract in the U.S. alone at $50 million. They said worldwide equipment sales could reach $150 million under the accord.</p>
<p>IBM's enhancements will provide the Geotek system with an open interface to other wireless standards.</p>
<p>Geotek has developed technology and is building commercial mobile radio networks in the U.S. and South Korea using its proprietary FHMA technology. The networks, providing voice and data transmission services, are designed to be used by businesses to track vehicles and employees in the field.</p>
<p>The two sides also signed a letter of intent under which IBM will market integrated mobile business solutions incorporating Geotek's FMHA network with IBM services and products. In addition, the two said they were discussing jointly offering enhanced FMHA systems systems globally.</p>
<p>In December 1996, the two sides signed a U.S. marketing agreement authorising IBM to sell Geotek's voice and packet data services with its own services.</p>
