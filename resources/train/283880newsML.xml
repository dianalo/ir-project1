<headline>Israeli shares end higher amid new year optimism.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-01-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli shares closed broadly higher on Thursday with traders saying that the first session of the new year opened on a wave of optimism.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 1.47 percent, or 3.11 points, to 214.15 on all-share turnover of 82 million shekels against 92 million shekels on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index gained 1.36 percent to 222.08.</p>
<p>On Wednesday there was no trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to enable the bourse to change its system for valuing share prices. From today, trading is conducted in &quot;whole&quot; share prices as opposed to the previous system of trading in percentages of shares' par value.</p>
<p>The change is technical and does not alter the actual value of the shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The new year started with rising optimism. Several Maof shares rose sharply for no evident reason. The approval of the budget is a very good sign,&quot; said Noam Braverman of the Central Securities Corp.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, parliament approved the government's 1997 budget. The budget of just under 190 billion shekels includes spending cuts, new taxes and other revenue measures totalling about seven billion shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, Finance Minister Dan Meridor has said that he expected the Bank of Israel to cut interest rates further. The feeling in the market is that share prices are very cheap and that the market is expected to rise,&quot; Braverman added.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise of the market was very surprising. Stocks rose sharply for no evident reason and players are very optimistic. The only thing that might explain the rise is the approval of the budget,&quot; said Baruch Glicksberg of Clal Insurance.</p>
<p>Israel Land Development Co, the most active share, surged six percent to 1,260 agorot on turnover of 4.9 million shekels. Israeli papers reported on Thursday that Ofer Nimrodi, whose family controls ILDC, purchased 1.7 million ILDC shares for 22 million shekels, which was 7 percent above their market value.</p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the second most active share, fell 1.0 percent to 1,609 agorot on volume of 4.3 million shekels.</p>
<p>Africa Israel Investments, the third most active, surged 6.0 percent to 43,153 agorot after the company said it would distribute to shareholders its stock in Leumi Insurance Holdings next Tuesday. The distribution is part of a multifaceted transaction under which the Italian insurer Generali is buying controlling of Leumi Insurance.</p>
