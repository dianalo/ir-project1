<p>Quebec's place in Canada dominated the campaign for the June 2 federal election, but Prime Minister Jean Chretien was criticized for ignoring the issue on Wednesday as he announced his new cabinet.</p>
<p>&quot;We note with dismay that the prime minister completely neglected to mention the unification of the country as a priority in a new government,&quot; the new opposition leader, Reform Party leader Preston Manning, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Quebeckers voted narrowly to stay in Canada in a 1995 referendum. Much of the recent Canadian election campaign focused on how the five major political parties would deal with Quebec's separatist sentiment.</p>
<p>But Chretien made few changes in his cabinet to reflect a creative approach to Quebec. All the cabinet ministers from Quebec were the same as in his first term, with only one Quebec minister changing portfolios.</p>
<p>The new justice minister, Anne McLellan, is from Alberta and does not speak French. The justice department will likely play a key role in any debate on the status of Quebec because the department is asking the Supreme Court of Canada to outline if Quebec can legally separate from Canada.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very good group of ministers,&quot; Chretien said, answering why he had not made significant changes in the Quebec ministers. Chretien's Liberal government was re-elected last week with a reduced majority.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the status quo,&quot; complained Jacques Brassard, intergovernmental affairs minister in Quebec's separatist provincial government.</p>
<p>The separatist Bloc Quebecois accused Chretien of taking a &quot;hard line&quot; against Quebec by reappointing Stephane Dion as intergovernmental affairs minister.</p>
<p>Dion has been Ottawa's front man in Quebec since the 1995 referendum. He has championed the federal government's so-called Plan B, which seeks to outline how to deal with Quebec if Quebeckers vote to separate in another referendum.</p>
<p>Separatists, as well as Conservative leader Jean Charest, said the plan showed no willingness on the part of Ottawa to accommodate Quebec.</p>
