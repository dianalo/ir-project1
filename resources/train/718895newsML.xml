<p>Russia's Gazprom, the world's largest gas company, published its 1996 accounts according to international standards for the first time on Thursday.</p>
<p>But analysts said the new numbers did not clarify the company's future prospects.</p>
<p>Gazprom reported 1996 net profit of 8.98 trillion roubles ($1.62 billion) under International Accounting Standards on sales of 126.24 trillion roubles ($22.7 billion).</p>
<p>But it said 57 percent of its receivables were settled by typically Russian barter trade and debt forgiveness.</p>
<p>Earnings per share were 426 roubles, it said.</p>
<p>Analysts gave different reactions to the results but said it was difficult to evaluate Gazprom since there was no analogous company.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a political stock -- it remains under government pressure,&quot; said one Western analyst, noting that the government had tapped it for taxes which consumed more than half Gazprom's 20.69 trillion rouble pre-tax profit.</p>
<p>&quot;The net profit number was a surprise. The tax ratio is quite high,&quot; he said, but added: &quot;We don't compare it to any company.&quot; Gazprom could also not be compared against its own past performance, since there are no reliable 1995 results.</p>
<p>Its future performance depends on whether the government will allow it to reap the benefits of reform or only pay for them, gas analysts said.</p>
<p>MC Securities Oil and Gas Director Stephen O'Sullivan said the new results were not surprising.</p>
<p>He agreed Gazprom was essentially unique but, like many analysts, said the best possible analogy was with leading companies in Russia's energy sector.</p>
<p>The new results showed Gazprom to be about as profitable as its closest peer LUKoil  LKOH.RTS, though Gazprom's IAS net profit was only about a quarter of the 33.22 trillion roubles reported according to Russian accounting standards in May.</p>
<p>Gazprom's net profit to sales ratio was 7.1 percent, compared with 8.7 percent for LUKoil and about eight for smaller oil producer Tomskneft  TOMG.RTS, O'Sullivan said.</p>
<p>But he predicted that earnings would outstrip those of LUKoil, which he put at about 7-8 percent, if regulatory reform could free up company management.</p>
<p>Gazprom wants to compete with international companies but with the cut-up of British Gas there are no publicly traded competitors, he said.</p>
<p>But its shares are more expensive than those of major oil companies. Its current price earnings ratio of about 24, based on the price of underlying shares covered by its London-trading American Depositary Share, is closer to LUKoil, above 30, than U.S. oil majors Mobil at 17.48 or Amoco at 16.06.</p>
<p>Many analysts said they had to wait for the battle for gas industry reform to die down before they could tell where Gazprom would stand.</p>
<p>&quot;If reforms continue, Gazprom will want to work more like a commercial entity, if it is going to be taxed like one,&quot; O'Sullivan said.</p>
