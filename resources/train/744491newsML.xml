<p>Philips Electronics NV is expected to report a rise of about 60 percent in net profit from ordinary operations on Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts say the sharp rise in earnings will be driven by the sale and closure of loss-making units, restructuring and cost-cutting measures and a stronger dollar.</p>
<p>Their estimates of ordinary net profit range from 429  to 540 million guilders ($240 million to $300 million), with a consensus around 490 million. This compares with 304 million in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts expect earnings growth to continue in the second half of the year and in both 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>Philips shares have soared this year, reflecting investors' faith in new chairman Cor Boonstra's ability to raise the profitability of Europe's biggest consumer electronics group.</p>
<p>Since the end of 1996, Philips shares have risen over 120 percent, strongly outperforming the AEX index of Dutch blue chip stocks which itself has chalked up a rise of some 47 percent.</p>
<p>Despite their rapid ascent, analysts say Philips shares are by no means overvalued at current levels of around 150 guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;Philips is in much better shape and there will be a further improvement in the coming years. Profitability will reach a structurally higher level,&quot; said Steven Vrolijk of ING Barings.</p>
<p>Vrolijk said that while previous chairman Jan Timmer had to be given credit for keeping Philips afloat, Boonstra had begun to turn Philips into a more efficient and profitable group.</p>
<p>Simon Street of BZW in London said the expected rise in second-quarter earnings was part of a more durable improvement.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't think it's a flash in the pan. We think there will be a progressive improvement quarter by quarter relative to 1996,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cost-cutting and more efficient production, particularly in the core Sound and Vision consumer electronics business, are expected to be a key factor behind higher earnings.</p>
<p>Philips has launched a major drive to reduce the number of external component suppliers and cut its purchasing costs.</p>
<p>The gradual severance of links with loss-making German firm Grundig is also seen lifting earnings in this sector.</p>
<p>Analysts expect reduced start-up losses from Philips' consumer telephones business and increased earnings from information technology services unit Origin whose earnings were depressed last year by integration costs after a merger.</p>
<p>Vrolijk says that at roughly 22 times his 1997 earnings per share (EPS) estimate of 7.00 guilders, Philips shares are slightly less expensive than the Dutch stock market average.</p>
<p>He rates Philips a buy, expecting EPS to rise to 9.40 guilders in 1998 and 10.85 in 1999, and he believes the share price can reach 175 guilders over the next year.</p>
<p>Street also sees further upside for the shares, predicting that EPS will rise to 10.10 guilders in 1998 from 6.80 in 1997 and 2.11 in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;On a 12-month view we still think the shares are undervalued,&quot; he said. ($ = 1.79 Netherland Antilles Guilders)</p>
