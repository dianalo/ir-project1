<p>U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross will return to Washington on Monday after Israel and the PLO failed to clinch a deal on a partial Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron, officials on both sides said.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat left Gaza for Europe early on Monday amidst Israeli accusations that he was stalling.</p>
<p>&quot;We're mad at Arafat. He's apparently trying to stall,&quot; said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak. &quot;There were no achievements and no agreement. Ross is going back to the United States,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Palestinians have said Israel was trying to renegotiate terms of the Hebron withdrawal which the Jewish state agreed to more than a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Palestinian and Israeli negotiators failed to agree. Talks ended very early this morning without any agreement on the same issues,&quot; said Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.</p>
<p>&quot;Arafat has already left,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned both Netanyahu and Arafat on Sunday to urge them to clinch the deal overnight before Arafat's pre-planned trip to European countries.</p>
<p>But talks between Israeli army chief Amnon Shahak and top officials of the Palestine Liberation Organisation broke off early on Monday with no progress.</p>
<p>Palestinians said the differences centred on Israel's demand for the right to pursue Palestinian militants into parts of Hebron it hands over to the PLO and on what arms Palestinian police would be allowed to carry.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has insisted on modifying security arrangements set in a redeployment deal which Israel's previous Labour-led government signed with the PLO last year. About 400 Jewish settlers live in enclaves in Hebron among 100,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>The troop redeployment has been delayed since March.</p>
<p>Arafat said late on Sunday he had received telephone calls from Clinton and from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein who had all stressed their desire for a speedy agreement.</p>
<p>Netanyahu aide Dore Gold had described Arafat's planned departure as a &quot;deadline&quot;.</p>
<p>Ross, mediating in the area for more than three weeks, almost left for home last week but changed his mind on the way to Tel Aviv airport when informed that progress had been made.</p>
<p>In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton had spoken to Netanyahu and Arafat for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Clinton, he said, had encouraged them &quot;to do everything they can to address the remaining issues relating to Oslo (peace accords') implementation and specifically security-related issues and the withdrawal from Hebron&quot;.</p>
<p>Before going to Gaza on Sunday, Ross said Arafat's European trip would hamper mediation efforts. The United States and Israel have been cool to a European role in the U.S.-brokered talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the pace of negotiations is affected when the leaders are not here. Also, my own presence is affected when the leaders aren't here because part of my mission is very clearly to go back and forth between the leaders,&quot; Ross said.</p>
