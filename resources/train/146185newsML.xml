<p>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Sunday the island's next general election may be held after January 5, 1997, state television reported.</p>
<p>It quoted Goh as telling a local meeting he planned to serve out his government's full five-year term, which ends in January.</p>
<p>The report superseded an earlier story on state television's text service implying that Goh had ruled out an election in 1996.</p>
<p>Under Singapore's constitution, Goh can call elections at any time up to three months after the end of his five-year term, it said.</p>
<p>Goh gave no date for the elections. In the past, he has said that if the elections were to take place in 1997 his favoured dates would be in either February or March.</p>
<p>Goh's People's Action Party (PAP) took around 60 percent of the vote and all but four of the 81 seats in Singapore's parliament at the last polls in 1991.</p>
<p>Local newspapers earlier quoted Goh as rejecting suggestions that he was merely a temporary leader, running the city-state while another candidate was groomed for the top job.</p>
<p>When he succeeded Singapore patriarch Lee Kuan Yew in 1990, some political analysts suggested Goh might only remain in power for a short while, and would likely be succeeded by deputy prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, Lee Kuan Yew's eldest son.</p>
<p>But the Sunday Times newspaper quoted Goh as ridiculing at a function on Saturday evening any suggestion that he was just standing in temporarily.</p>
<p>&quot;When I first took over, I remember people touting me as a seat-warmer,&quot; Goh was quoted as telling a meeting of activists of the ruling PAP.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I can qualify as the longest seat-warmer in history. In the coming election, if you signal that you want me to continue, I shall leave the seat so warm that my successor will have to find a new chair,&quot; he said.</p>
