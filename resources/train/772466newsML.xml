<title>CHINA: Hopewell working on Thai rail financing.</title>

<p>Hopewell Holdings Ltd said on Friday it  was continuing to work closely with bankers on a financing solution  for its Bangkok mass transit project which will be presented to the  Thai government in detail next month.  </p>
<p>Hopewell reaffirmed its commitment to the Bangkok Elevated Road and  Train System (BERTS) after a meeting with the State Railway of Thailand  on Friday.</p>
<p>The company said meetings were held with bankers in Europe and London  last week and good progress has been made, but added bankers require  more time to conclude their financial planning.</p>
<p>Hopewell said it asked senior officials from the Bank Group to meet  with the Thai government as soon as possible to confirm their commitment  to the project, present the progress on the financing plan and timetable,  and obtain views and suggestions.  </p>
<p>The Bank Group includes Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, Bayerische  Landesbank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Group, and  West Merchant Bank, it said.</p>
<p>Hopewell said it will meet separately with the government if requested.</p>
<p>The original schedule for the project financing has been affected  by the decline of the economic climate in Thailand and the devaluation  of the baht, and that funding for any project in Thailand is now harder,  the company said.</p>
<p>Hopewell said despite various issues faced by the project, it strongly  believes that financial closing can be achieved, and that it continued  to work with the Bank Group on a solution which will be presented  to the government in detail next month.</p>
<p>Hopewell earlier said it has received no formal deadline from the  Thai government.</p>
<p>Sathien Wongvichien, Thailand's Deputy Permanent Secretary for Transport  and Communications, said on July 24 that if Hopewell could not come  up with a firm financing package by the end of July, the ministry  could exercise its contractual right to scrap the 30-year BERTS operating  concession awarded to Hopewell in 1990.  </p>
<p>Hopewell Chairman Gordon Wu said on July 21 that the financing structure  was in place, but added he did not want to take the money until Bangkok  promised to clear land acquisition problems and agreed to a fare rise  to cover increased costs.</p>
<p>On Friday, Standard and Poor's affirmed its BBB-minus corporate crdit  rating on Hopewell and revised the outlook for the company to stable  from negative.</p>
<p>The rating agency said Hopewell's sale of its power unit had allowed  it to cut leverage and better focus on management of its existing  portfolio and future investment commitments.</p>
<p>But the rating still reflected considerable uncertainty regarding  the future of BERTS and its implementation, which helped reduce the  potential for any upgrade, S&amp;P said.</p>
