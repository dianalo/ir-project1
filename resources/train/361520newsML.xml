<p>U.N. human rights observer Graham Turnbull used to stride around in a cream-coloured linen jacket in a remote region of Rwanda, selflessly investigating massacres in one of the most dangerous corners of central Africa.</p>
<p>He paid the ultimate price.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old Briton from York was team leader for U.N. human rights observers in the southwestern Cyangugu region, where aid workers sleep in sandbagged homes and the Tutsi-dominated army fights Hutu rebels striking from Burundi.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Turnbull and his four U.N. colleagues were ruthlessly gunned down in cold blood in a clearly marked U.N. car by unknown killers in a far-flung commune of Cyangugu.</p>
<p>The killing, the latest in a series of attacks targetting aid workers, has shocked relief agencies doing vital frontline work in faraway conflict zones from Chechnya to Zaire.</p>
<p>At agencies' Geneva headquarters, fears are palpable at emergency talks to improve security and prevent aid workers from being hunted down and killed, kidnapped or threatened.</p>
<p>In Kigali, U.N. officials and aid workers immediately met after the killings to discuss security. U.N. staff were ordered back to Kigali while the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) suspended their operations.</p>
<p>Diplomats said full U.N. evacuation appeared unlikely under directions given so far from world headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>The U.N. has lost more than 150 workers in conflicts since 1987, including 50 in Rwanda, said Raymonde Martineau, head of the U.N. staff association for security of aid workers.</p>
<p>&quot;More and more aid workers are being killed in places where there are warring factions, statelets, enclaves and governments with no control,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But this is a political problem beyond us. It's a question for the leaders of the world to get together and try to find solutions to these conflicts. Internal conflicts have increased security problems for aid workers.&quot;</p>
<p>U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata warned of the dangers ahead this week when she urged the world to come to terms with the increasingly militarised nature of conflicts.</p>
<p>&quot;During the Cold War period, refugees were not militarised people and donors were much more resigned to prolonged refugee problems,&quot; Ogata told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But today, refugees are victims and sometimes perpetrators of internal conflicts. They flee together with armed elements.&quot;</p>
<p>Aid workers said the dangers were growing because the line between the risks that war brings with it -- stray bullets, mines, shells -- and violent banditry was becoming blurred.</p>
<p>Aid agencies attract criminals with fleets of vehicles and sophisticated communications equipment and are seen as rich.</p>
<p>&quot;By definition, we are targets,&quot; said John Logan, security officer of the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.</p>
<p>&quot;But conflicts and banditry are now merging. The line between freedom fighters and bandits is becoming hazier and hazier. Humanitarian work has now reached a point when aid workers are getting closer to the frontline and are targetted.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, in the remote settlement of Shabunda in a rainforest in east Zaire, UNHCR staff were stranded without roads, phones or cars near fighting between rebels and troops.</p>
<p>Early on Thursday in the capital of the remote Central Asian republic of Tajikistan, four UNHCR employees were snatched by armed rebels who also seized four U.N. military observers, two Red Cross workers and four Russian journalists this week.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now in a new conflict environment and new security answers are needed,&quot; said Kim Gordon-Bates, an official of the Geneva-based ICRC which lost nine expatriates in brutal attacks in 1996 -- six in Chechnya and three in Burundi.</p>
<p>&quot;In wars there is always risk and we assess that risk. But there's been a tendency to mask political objectives with humanitarian action. If the world uses humanitarian action to get political results, then we become pawns in war.&quot;</p>
