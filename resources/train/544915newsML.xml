<p>Finnish forest industry group Enso Oy's acquisition of German paper-maker E. Holtzmann &amp; Cie AG makes it the second biggest paper manufacturer in Europe, Enso chief executive Jukka Harmala said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;If we look at the overall situation among paper and board producers (in Europe)... then we are in second place,&quot; Harmala told a news conference after Enso said it bought 50.4 percent of Holtzmann and would buy a further 39 percent next year. @</p>
<p>The addition of Holtzmann's annual capacity of 700,000 tonnes of newsprint, uncoated magazine paper (SC) and wallpaper base would raise Enso's total yearly production capacity of paper and board to 6.7 million tonnes in 1997, Harmala said.</p>
<p>Harmala said Enso would be second only to Europe's biggest paper-maker, Finnish rival UPM-Kymmene Oy , with total output capacity of 7.4 million tonnes, but ahead of Sweden's Stora , with 6.3 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now ... in a situation where we can offer all the products that publishers need and we are also competitive in size,&quot; Harmala said. @</p>
<p>In shopping around for a European firm, Enso had been particularly keen on finding a producer of SC magazine paper -- a grade that has been lacking from its own product range, he said.</p>
<p>Holtzmann has an annual SC-paper output capacity of 340,000 tonnes, and the total European market for SC is now about 2.5 million tonnes per year, Enso said earlier in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This magazine paper grade was the kind that we thought we needed,&quot; Harmala said.</p>
<p>The acquisition would make Enso &quot;a big German producer of these products&quot;, Harmala said, referring to SC.</p>
<p>Holtzmann's other main product is newsprint, with an annual production capacity of 280,000 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>Enso produced 857,000 tonnes of newsprint in 1996.</p>
<p>With the acquisition, Enso would become Europe's fourth biggest manufacturer of newsprint and also the fourth biggest producer of SC paper, an Enso official said on the fringes of the news conference.</p>
<p>Harmala said Holtzmann's second main attraction had been its &quot;very strong market position.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of this deal, our position on the German market has improved quite considerably,&quot; Harmala said. @</p>
<p>He said the addition of Holtzmann's output would double Enso's deliveries of newsprint in Germany, where the Finnish group already produces newsprint at its Sachsen Papier subsidiary in Eilenburg.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a very big local producer,&quot; Harmala said.</p>
<p>Cooperation with Holtzmann's previous major owners, publishing group Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), would continue, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made agreements for the continuation of deliveries (to WAZ),&quot; Harmala said. @</p>
<p>Holtzmann's wallpaper base operations, with annual capacity of 55,000 tonnes, was not a strategic core business for Enso, &quot;but it is profitable and will probably continue,&quot; Harmala said.</p>
