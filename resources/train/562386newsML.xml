<p>Sudanese rebels said on Tuesday they had captured two army garrisons near the eastern town of Kassala, close to the Eritrean border.</p>
<p>Yassir Arman of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) told Reuters the garrisons were at Timkit and Thaday and that government troops withdrew from them in the past week. There was no independent confirmation of the rebel report.</p>
<p>The SPLA is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a coalition between southern and northern opponents of the Islamist government in Khartoum.</p>
<p>&quot;The forces of the NDA...captured Timkit garrison, which is northeast of Tukan and about 50 km (30 miles) north of Kassala&quot;, Arman said. Both Timkit and Thaday, which is south of Tukan, fell after sieges which lasted several weeks, he added.</p>
<p>Arman said Sudanese government forces had withdrawn towards Kassala, where they were reinforcing the defences.</p>
<p>&quot;They are digging trenches around Kassala. They are starting to prepare the defense of Kassala. NDA troops have seen it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said this was the first time the joint opposition had used the military forces of the two big northern parties, the Umma and the Democratic Unionists (DUP), in operations in the area around Kassala.</p>
<p>On the offensive in southern Sudan, Arman said that with last week's fighting and the capture of Wun Rog and Rumbek, the rebels had cut off all the government's land links to Juba, the main southern town and army garrison.</p>
<p>&quot;It...is a big blow to the government. This (capturing the two towns) connects the liberated areas in Western Equatoria and Bahr al-Gazal for the first time in the history of the war. It cuts all land reinforcement. Juba can now only get reinforcements by air,&quot; the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Arman said the government had refused to exchange five rebel prisoners for 300 government prisoners held by the SPLA.</p>
<p>&quot;The Norwegian Red Cross has been given an offer by the... SPLA that we are prepared to release 300 prisoners of war in exchange for five prisoners of war who were captured in an ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) plane early this year. But Khartoum turned the offer down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our military and security sources in Khartoum say that the five prisoners have been killed. We have hundreds of prisoners of war. We declare them and the Red Cross visits them. Khartoum should do the same,&quot; he added.</p>
