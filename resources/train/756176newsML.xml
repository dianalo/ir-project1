<p>U.S.-based commodities group Cargill said on Friday it and Groupe d'Investissements et de Participations Afrique (GIP) have agreed to form a joint venture to originate, condition and export cocoa and coffee from Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>Also under consideration is a plan to build in the Ivorian capital Abidjan a new cocoa processing plant, which would have an annual capacity of 65,000 tonnes, Cargill Europe said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;The two companies have pledged to work diligently to reach a final agreement on the joint venture,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Terms of the venture agreement were not released. Cargill said the pact was also subject to final approval by the boards of directors of the two companies.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a Cargill official told Reuters that the group and Ivorian cocoa exporter SICC, a subsidiary of GIP, were close to agreeing a partnership deal in Ivory Coast including plans for a cocoa factory there.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very close to an agreement,&quot; Cargill manager Lionel Soulard told Reuters. &quot;We should make a decision by the end of this week,&quot; he said after senior Cargill managers arrived for talks from Monday.</p>
<p>Cargill and SICC have been in talks since late 1996 on building a 65,000 tonnes capacity cocoa processing plant. Discussions had been extended after a deal expected earlier this year was delayed, Cargill and SICC managers told Reuters at the time.</p>
<p>Cargill and SICC were also discussing an integrated cocoa marketing and shipping arrangement, Soulard said.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is encouraging local processing in a bid to add value to exports. It aims to process 50 percent of its annual cocoa production, now running at about 1.0 million a year, by 2000.</p>
