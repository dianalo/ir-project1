<p>Leaders of the world's big industrial powers demanded in a draft statement on Saturday that Balkan leaders do more to protect peace in Bosnia or face a cut-off in international aid.</p>
<p>In a statement expected to be approved during the second day of the Group of Seven summit, the leaders expressed their deep dissatisfaction with the pace of refugee resettlement and other non-military aspects of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords.</p>
<p>&quot;We are prepared to continue to help the states of this region, but our continued commitment is not unconditional,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It singled out Croatia and Serbia for special criticism, faulting them for failing to demonstrate &quot;a stronger commitment to the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement sidestepped whether the NATO peace-keeping force in Bosnia would be withdrawn as scheduled in June 1998, saying: &quot;We support the mission of the stabilisation force to help provide a secure environment by June 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States plans to withdraw its 8,500 troops from the 31,000-strong force as scheduled.</p>
<p>European leaders at the G7 summit on Friday night expressed concern to President Bill Clinton about the withdrawal plans, but he refused to budge. The Europeans fear a U.S. withdrawal will lead the force to collapse and allow war to start again.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton reaffirmed to the other leaders public statements he has made reiterating the planned withdrawal date.</p>
<p>&quot;As the president has indicated, there is a defined mission that expires June of 1998 and that's the timetable we're on,&quot; McCurry said. &quot;And the president simultaneously said we ought to do everything we can and use every available day to deepen and nurture the prospects for peace there.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton's statements have been seen in the United States as falling short of a cast-iron commitment that the troops will in fact leave on the target date.</p>
<p>The draft G-7 statement warned that parties to the U.S.-brokered Dayton accords who failed to carry out their obligations, especially on allowing refugees to return to their homes, &quot;will lose access to economic assistance.&quot;</p>
<p>It also demanded that the Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb leaders accelerate the the development of democratic institutions, including permitting a free press, in the war-ravaged former Yugoslav region.</p>
<p>&quot;We call upon the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  (Serbia) to meet their responsibility and obligations to work for a democratic, stable and secure future for their citizens,&quot; the draft said.</p>
<p>Reiterating a long-held position, it said it wanted to see war criminals brought to justice before an international tribunal and warned the governments in the region that economic and other assistance is &quot;dependent on compliance with these obligations.&quot;</p>
