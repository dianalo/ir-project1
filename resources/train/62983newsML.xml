<p>Lebanon's economy has picked up since the Israeli blitz that battered the country in April but economists doubt it can return to last year's seven percent growth unless Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri changes his policies.</p>
<p>Hariri's resounding election victory this month, which made him a dominant figure in parliament and increased confidence on Beirut financial markets, offers a golden opportunity for a much-needed change of direction, economists and bankers say.</p>
<p>His multi-billion dollar reconstruction drive has set Lebanon on the road to postwar recovery, but it has also created a huge budget deficit, a mountain of public debt and treasury bill interest rates that have crowded out the private sector and slowed economic growth.</p>
<p>Interest rates went so high a year ago that private sector activity has fallen to a crawl.</p>
<p>Bank Audi, a leading Beirut bank, noted &quot;recessionary signs&quot; in its second quarter economic report while Fransabank, another major bank, said: &quot;Economic slowdown has continued during 1996 Q2 with further stagnationary features.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists say GDP growth was already down to two to three percent a year before the Israeli blitz that the government estimates cost $500 million in destruction and dislocation.</p>
<p>According to the central bank, economic activity has since bounced back to 1995 highs, but economists say the improvement is more apparent than real and it is time Hariri reassessed the reconstruction drive which is straining Lebanon's finances to the limit.</p>
<p>&quot;After the first three years of the reconstruction process he should evaluate what to do,&quot; economist Kamal Hamdan told Reuters after Hariri emerged at the head of a powerful group in parliament that should give him new political freedom.</p>
<p>&quot;Seven years after the civil war ended he can't go on borrowing from abroad for such an ambitious plan with a 50 percent budget deficit,&quot; Hamdan said.</p>
<p>Public debt has grown sharply since April and the government deficit for the first eight months was 48 percent against a 38 percent annual target.</p>
<p>Hamdan said the deficit would actually be a whopping 55-60 percent if the government had not delayed paying many salaries, contractors and expropriation dues linked to reconstruction.</p>
<p>Treasury-bill subscriptions have helped to finance the deficit and bolster the improving exchange rate of the Lebanese pound against the U.S. dollar since Hariri took office in 1992.</p>
<p>But economists and bankers chiefly blame the high interest rates for slower than expected growth in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>Stories are told in Beirut of people who simply shut down their businesses last October and put their millions into T-bills as 12-month yields approached 40 percent.</p>
<p>The top 24-month rate is still above 22 percent. In contrast, economists estimate that consumer prices rose only 2.8 percent in the first half of 1996, and inflation for the whole of the year will be about four percent.</p>
<p>&quot;These interest rates are a terrible cost to the economy,&quot; economist Marwan Iskander said. &quot;They are increasing the unearned income element and the non-availability of finance on reasonable terms has caused people to slow down projects.&quot;</p>
<p>The alternative was to cut the deficit to a point where investors would have faith in the stability of the currency on the basis of normal economic elements rather than stimulated public sector demand.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Hariri should and can move towards lowering interest rates, increasing competition in the marketplace and giving a boost to economic activity,&quot; Iskander said.</p>
<p>&quot;He has to dynamise the economy by making credit easier, especially for small and medium enterprises which are finding it very difficult to survive.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamal Hamdan, however, said the government must keep rates reasonably high to finance the deficit. The best it could do was continue a slow reduction already underway.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they can accelerate the reduction of interest rates, or they won't find the necessary money,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Iskander said the government could reduce the deficit by selling assets like the profitable Credit Libanais bank, owned by the central bank and recently valued at $120 million. Millions of square metres of state land along unused coastal railway tracks could also be sold.</p>
<p>&quot;I should say the government should sell most of the utilities to the private sector, provided there are national authorities to supervise pricing and prevent monopolistic profits,&quot; Iskander said.</p>
<p>Despite the concerns about the economy, Beirut bankers say Hariri's election success has helped spur bullishness for the Lebanese pound and T-bills.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign funds are getting interested in Lebanon now. Emerging market funds want to get in....There is a genuine, serious interest abroad and a lot of evaluations and studies are being done by institutions,&quot; a Beirut dealer said.</p>
<p>Another banker said subscriptions to two-year T-bills and renewed purchases of Lebanese pounds by investors were putting the treasury in surplus and offering a chance to change policy.</p>
<p>&quot;This regaining of confidence...is an important opportunity for the government to re-think its economic and financial policy,&quot; the banker said.</p>
<p>&quot;It should re-think the nature of its expenditures, reduce interest rates as servicing the debt is an important proportion of government spending, reduce current spending in favour of investment, and maybe introduce longer-term bonds and re-think the maturity of the debt,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Kamal Hamdan fears that, now Hariri is strong in parliament, overconfidence may make him miss the opportunity for change.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid that, while Hariri should assess the structural problems very quietly, the danger is that he is now a one-man show more than ever before. He is the biggest chief in parliament and he has all the main public institutions in his hands,&quot; Hamdan said.</p>
