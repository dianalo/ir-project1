<p>The Bank of Thailand on Tuesday suspended 42 troubled finance firms in an attempt to inspire public and investor confidence in the country's ailing financial sector.</p>
<p>The move raised the number of finance firms whose operations were suspended to 58.</p>
<p>Bank of Thailand Governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi told reporters that the finance companies have borrowed about 430 billion baht ($13.9 billion) from the central bank's Financial Institutions Development Fund.</p>
<p>Officials estimated that the money the fund lent to the whole sector was about 500 billion baht.</p>
<p>&quot;Loss of confidence in the financial sector caused the problems. The fund has almost come to the point that it can no longer support the troubled companies with liquidity,&quot; Chaiyawat said.</p>
<p>&quot;This measure will separate the healthy financial firms from the troubled ones. It is expected to stop the negative rumours and the confidence in the sector will be restored,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The following measures were taken by the central bank:</p>
<p>-- Clearly separate good from bad financial institutions by suspending 42 firms on the top of the 16 ailing finance firms suspended in late June</p>
<p>-- Limit the role of the Financial Institution Development Fund in propping up financial institutions</p>
<p>-- The new suspended firms were given 60 days to come up with rehabilitation plans and due diligence. The central bank will decide on a case by case basis whether they can resume business within one month after receiving the proposed plans.</p>
<p>-- The central bank said both creditors, domestic or foreign, and depositors of the troubled firms will be fully protected</p>
<p>-- Depositors of companies that have been ordered to suspend operations can exchange their promissory notes and negotiable certificates of deposits (NCDs) at state-run Krung Thai Bank Plc.</p>
<p>-- Creditors of the troubled companies will also have the right to exchange notes or NCDs or arrange for a new borrowing contract with Krung Thai Bank</p>
<p>--  The government will set up a deposit insurance institution. Meanwhile, the Financial Institution Development Fund will guarantee deposits in the remaining healthy firms.</p>
