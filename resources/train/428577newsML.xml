<p>Albanian rebels seized this government stronghold in the south on Saturday, putting newly-arrived troops to flight and seizing thousands of weapons.</p>
<p>In a humiliating defeat for President Sali Berisha, at least seven helicopters of army reinforcements fled on foot shortly after landing and a one-star general was captured by rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;The town has fallen to the people. Berisha's troops have turned tail and are in hiding,&quot; said rebel leader Omer Litse.</p>
<p>He said senior rebel officers were meeting on Saturday night and a rebel council would be in place on Sunday to organise the town's defence. Gjirokaster was the latest in a series of towns in the south to fall to the rebels.</p>
<p>The head of the army reinforcements, General Ali Kontrakou, and his aide-de-camp, Georgi Vlnti, were held by the rebels, Litse said.</p>
<p>Documents with the general showed the military was planning an assault on the rebel-held southern port of Sarande and on Tepelene, north of Gjirokaster, Litse said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of rebels raced through the captured town in cars, firing wildly into the air. Hundreds of residents looted state warehouses for food and could be seen carrying away flour, rice and canned milk.</p>
<p>Official sources said more than seven helicopters ferried in fresh troops on Saturday -- at least a company of 120 men -- from a base in the southern town of Permet.</p>
<p>The troops were taken by lorries to Gjirokaster's square but they were met by heavily-armed rebels and angry residents. They turned tail and scrambled to surrounding forests and hills.</p>
<p>About 30 km (20 miles) from the Greek border, Gjirokaster was the last government stronghold in southern Albania and its fall gives the rebels full control of the region. It will make any attempt by the army to regain the region more difficult.</p>
<p>Most of the government troops had retreated in disarray and were trapped in the Shen Triadhe monastery, two km (one mile) east of the town.</p>
<p>The rebels, who have about two dozen tanks, seized four more during the Gjirokaster showdown and drove them towards the monastery, a Reuters correspondent said.</p>
<p>The rebels had also stormed and ransacked the army base just north of Gjirokaster, seizing some 10,000 weapons while officers and soldiers stood by watching, a Reuters Television crew said.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of injuries and the capture of Gjirokaster appeared to be bloodless.</p>
<p>Rebels in the hills about Sarande, just across from the Greek tourist island of Corfu, practised manoeuvres in at least a dozen tanks at a captured army base.</p>
<p>Former base commander Major Ilir Kermezi and scores of his soldiers switched sides to join the rebels after anti-government riots swept this region near the Greek border last weekend.</p>
<p>A Reuters correspondent saw at least 12 old Chinese-built tanks manoeuvring around the Bajkaji base. Kermezi said 25 tanks at the base were in working condition.</p>
<p>He showed off hundreds of shells for tank cannons during a tour of the base 20 km (12 miles) into the hills above Sarande.</p>
<p>He also displayed thousands of rounds of smaller calibre ammunition for assault rifles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers. Dozens of barrels of petrol were at a base depot for the tanks.</p>
<p>&quot;We tell Berisha to come down and seize southern Albania if he dares but he won't find a single soldier in the south who supports him,&quot; said Sopot Devvish, a former army lieutenant at the base who has joined the rebel cause.</p>
<p>He made his boast hours before Gjirokaster went over to the rebels.</p>
<p>Villages in the rugged hills around Bajkaji were supplying food to the base for the ex-soldiers. Rebels have set up camps in the hills and thrown up dozens of roadblocks in the region.</p>
<p>Southern Albania has been swept by anti-government protests and riots since January when popular, but fraudulent, savings schemes collapsed, wiping out the savings of many families.</p>
<p>Anger has focused on Berisha for allowing the unregulated &quot;pyramid&quot; schemes to flourish and for failing to warn investors of their dangers.</p>
<p>&quot;We want our money back. We worked like dogs in Greece. I had three million drachmas ($12,500) in the pyramids,&quot; said Sopot. &quot;We will take anybody but Berisha.&quot;</p>
<p>The self-styled rebels, whose main demands are that they get their money back and that Berisha quit, now control most of the country from the coastal port of Vlore to the Greek border.</p>
