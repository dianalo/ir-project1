<p>A Dutch soccer fan died and dozens were injured on Sunday in a pre-arranged battle between supporters of rival first division clubs who used mobile telephones to out-manoeuvre police.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Ajax Amsterdam and Feyenoord Rotterdam fans armed with baseball bats, clubs and knives streamed to waste ground along the A9 motorway near Amsterdam for a showdown ahead of Feyenoord's match against AZ Alkmaar in the northern Netherlands.</p>
<p>&quot;One man is known to have died, but as yet I have no details on the precise number of wounded,&quot; police spokesman Alfred Ellwanger said.</p>
<p>Reuters photographer Jasper Juinen found the area littered with burned cars. Dutch riot police were scouring the wasteland for weapons. &quot;The atmosphere is still very tense,&quot; he reported.</p>
<p>Dutch radio said the dead fan was an Ajax supporter.</p>
<p>Police said they had known the supporters planned to meet but were unable to prevent the bloodshed because the gang chose their battle ground at the last minute and spread the word by mobile phones.</p>
<p>&quot;We would have needed airborne troops to get between them,&quot; a local police chief told Dutch radio.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a black day for Dutch football,&quot; Feyenoord chairman Jorien van den Herik told Dutch radio.</p>
<p>Ajax chairman Michael van Praag said that in the past he had called on other clubs and police to hammer out a joint policy to combat football violence. &quot;Until now nothing has been done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shocked government ministers condemned the incident, calling for a renewed police clampdown on football violence which has resurfaced in recent years after a long period of relative calm.</p>
<p>Home affairs minister Hans Dijkstal told Dutch television the government looked to be losing its grip on soccer hooliganism and urgently needed to review its strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is hard work for the police,&quot; he said. &quot;We must track down and punish these criminal gangs.&quot;</p>
<p>Along with their English counterparts, Dutch fans were among some of Europe's most feared soccer vandals in the 1970s, but improved policing methods based on tracking known hooligans brought violence under control.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, organised violence has become more difficult to trace, as fans no longer travel en masse to matches but make last-minute arrangements by mobile phone, a police intelligence officer cautioned in a recent newspaper interview.</p>
<p>Police defused a similar incident earlier this year, when they intervened in another pre-arranged battle between Feyenoord and Ajax supporters in north Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Intelligence officers intercepted information about the planned clash and riot police were able to confiscate an arsenal of knives, baseball bats and iron bars, chains and pickaxes.</p>
<p>But on Sunday police were helpless to intervene.</p>
