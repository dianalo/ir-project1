<p>China said on Saturday it would cut the cost of international telephone calls by an average of 30 percent but raise the price of local phone calls by 20 percent.</p>
<p>The cost of mailing a domestic letter would jump as much as 400 percent with all of the new rates going into effect on Sunday, the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>Excessively high international charges were seriously affecting China's international telephone business while local phone calls were set too low, resulting in losses, according to the news agency.</p>
<p>The cost of a telephone call from Beijing to the United States would be cut to 21 yuan ($2.53) per minute from 26.25 yuan now while the cost of a call to Japan would fall to 14.50 yuan per minute from 18.15 yuan.</p>
<p>China is facing increased competition from so-called 'call back' services which allow customers to make payments overseas and take advantage of usually lower foreign rates.</p>
<p>The price of a local phone call in Beijing would climb considerably more than the average, rising 44 percent to 0.18 yuan per minute from 0.125 now, according to local telephone authorities.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications would reduce telephone installation fees and telephone service fees for rural areas, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>It also called for an end to &quot;excessive charges&quot; set on top of official rates for telephone services by hotels, guest houses and office buildings.</p>
<p>The basic cost of mailing a domestic letter would rise to a flat 0.5 yuan from a range of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan currently. The post office would still be losing money as the average cost of delivering a letter was 0.89 yuan, according to the news agency. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
