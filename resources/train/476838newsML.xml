<p>Turkish State Minister Ahmet Cemil Tunc arrived in Baghdad on Monday to discuss increasing trade with Iraq under the oil-for-food deal signed with the United Nations.</p>
<p>Tunc said his country was seeking to extend its trade with Iraq under the U.N. resolution 986 which allows Baghdad to sell oil worth $2 billion over six months to buy food and medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;What we aim now within the scope of (resolution) 986 is to extend our trade and hope that there will be another extension of 986,&quot; Tunc told Reuters shortly after arriving in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Under the deal, which went into effect in December, Turkey has a contract to lift 75,000 barrels per day of Iraqi crude.</p>
<p>The bulk of the limited Iraqi oil exports is being shipped through a pipeline to the Turkish terminal of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The Turkish minister said Ankara had asked the U.N. Security Council to allow Turkey to trade food and medicine for Iraqi oil in addition to the 986 resolution. &quot;We will exert utmost efforts to achieve this goal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tunc said the Turkish energy minister was expected in Baghdad next month to discuss details of a gas agreement reached by the two countries in December. The pact was concluded in Turkey during a visit by Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammed Rasheed.</p>
<p>Details of the agreement have not been given but Iraqi and Turkish officials said last summer a gas pipeline with annual capacity of 10 billion cubic metres would be built.</p>
<p>The first food shipments under the oil deal arrived in Iraq from Turkey last week. They were white beans, chickpeas and vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Iraq said that from April it would increase the monthly food rations distributed to Iraqis under the oil programme with the U.N.</p>
