<p>The German government has called on the city state of Hamburg to ban political activity by the international spokesman for the Marxist rebel group involved in the Lima hostage crisis, government sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>The move followed a Peruvian media report that Lima's Foreign Ministry had asked Germany to cancel political asylum status granted in 1993 to Isaac Velazco.</p>
<p>The government sources said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet had authorised Interior Minister Manfred Kanther to contact Hamburg officials. But the sources added that there were no grounds to cancel political asylum under German law.</p>
<p>As the main mouthpiece of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), Velazco gave news conferences in several European cities and issued regular statements on behalf of the 14 rebels inside the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima.</p>
<p>Velazco told Reuters he had not been officially told to stop his political activity. &quot;With political asylum, I have my rights,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hamburg police told Reuters they had summoned Velazco to discuss his threats of reprisal attacks on Peru after troops stormed the residence in Lima on April 22, freeing all but one of the 72 hostages and killing all 14 MRTA rebels.</p>
<p>But a Hamburg police spokesman said criminal proceedings were not being considered against Velazco at the moment.</p>
<p>Hamburg prosecutors told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper threats by somebody like Velazco against politicians abroad were not punishable under German law.</p>
<p>Velazco says he carries United Nations travel documents and is a political exile from Peru.</p>
<p>The Peruvian media report said if German authorities did not strip Velazco's asylum, Peru may seek his extradition.</p>
