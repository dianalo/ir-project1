<p>British unemployment fell at a slower rate than recorded in recent months in March, suggesting big distortions in the monthly data from an overhaul of the benefits system may be finally coming to an end.</p>
<p>&quot;The monthly fall this time looks like it is coming closer to the trend shown by the quarterly Labour Force Survey, so the big distortions may be finally washing out,&quot; said Andrew Cates, UK economist at UBS.</p>
<p>Unemployment fell by 41,100 in March compared with 66,400 in February.  </p>
<p>This compares with a monthly average of 60,600 over the last six months.</p>
<p>In contrast the Labour Force Survey, which uses an internationally approved measure of unemployment, showed the jobless total fell by 111,000 in the three months to February, a monthly average of 35,000.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect monthly falls to revert to the trend shown by the LFS, and in line with the strength of the economy which would be around 25,000 or 30,000 a month, declining slightly towards the end of the year as the economy starts to slow,&quot; said Cates.  </p>
<p>Britain's monthly figures uniquely measure unemployment not just as people out of work, but also eligible for benefit and able to prove they are activity seeking work.</p>
<p>The most recent change came in October when the government scrapped unemployment benefit and replaced it with the Jobseekers' Allowance which brought with it more rigorous eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>Monthly falls accelerated sharply as a result. The ONS attributed this to Job Centres struggling with operational changes, but the government said the scheme flushed out people who were no longer considered unemployed under the new rules.  </p>
<p>Ian Stewart, UK economist at Merrill Lynch, said it makes sense that the distortions caused by the JSA are coming to an end and monthly falls should now stay at a more realistic level.</p>
<p>&quot;The staggeringly big falls of 70-80,000 seen in recent months should now decline to 40-50,000, consistent with a falling away of the JSA effect and continued strong activity in the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said the size of the falls will soon shrink further if economic growth is curbed by monetary tightening. &quot;It is now the case that the labour market responds very early to changes in GDP -- the lags are not as long as they used to be.&quot;  </p>
<p>Cates said with nominal and real earnings pressure now in evidence -- average earnings grew 5.0 percent in the year to February -- the present level of labour market tightness merited an interest rate rise.</p>
<p>&quot;It does warrant a rate rise. Earnings growth is not consistent with an inflation target of 2.5 percent, but it's nothing to get too excited about and we would recommend just 75 basis points by the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>But Simon Briscoe said the LFS survey provides no case for monetary tightening.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is no acceleration in the pace of hiring which remains muted. The economy is not, therefore, so strong and the labour market does not justify higher interest rates. Indeed, shaking off fraudulent claimants of benefit, in effect cutting family income, could restrain, not boost the economy.&quot;</p>
