<p>London will continue to prosper as a global financial centre whether or not Britain decides to participate in European monetary union, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, provided that thorough preparations are put in hand, the UK financial sector should continue to prosper regardless of participation in monetary union,&quot; it said in a report entitled &quot;Preparing for EMU.&quot;</p>
<p>The report was written by a working group established by the BBA, the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) and the London Investment Banking Association.  </p>
<p>The report said there was a strong probability that a single currency would start in 1999 or soon after and this would involve unprecedented change in financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, if the UK participates in EMU, the CIty should consolidate its position as Europe's leading financial centre. In the event of non-participation, London's strong position as a global financial centre should still endure,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>However, there was no room for complacency and UK markets needed to prepare adequately and in good time.  </p>
<p>Regardless of whether Britain joined the single currency or not, &quot;competitive considerations argue for the development of UK-based Euro payments and settlements facilities,&quot; the BBA said.</p>
<p>It acknowledged that there was a possibility that institutions and markets in non-participating states could face discrimination.</p>
<p>&quot;Whilst, in principle, such actions could be subject to legal challenge by the institutions affected, in practice this is not realistic.&quot;  </p>
<p>However, as payments systems were an integral part of the single market, restrictions on access to the TARGET real-time payments system could not be justified, the BBA said.</p>
<p>It praised the work of the Bank of England to encourage coordinated preparations for EMU, but said the implications for the entire economy were such that only the government could provide the necessary leadership and coordination.</p>
<p>The report said Britain would still attract considerable Euro business if it did not join the single currency.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the EMU area were to be characterised by a high regulation culture, the competitive position of the City would be strengthened further,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;...The advent of a single currency should lead to greater economic integration in the EMU area and, should monetary union prove to be an economic success, London would probably be less favourably positioned to take advantage of the considerable business opportunities that would be likely to ensue.&quot;</p>
<p>It warned that perceptions of Britain being &quot;sidelined&quot; in the European Union could discourage institutions from basing new operations here.</p>
<p>&quot;If the UK does not join the single currency, it would be important for the UK to maintain a constructive relationship with participating member states,&quot; the Bankers' Association added.</p>
