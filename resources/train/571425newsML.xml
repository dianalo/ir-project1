<p>The Bucharest bourse's first</p>
<p>tier, which has been taking strong volumes since the start of</p>
<p>the year, maintained command of the market on Friday,</p>
<p>accounting for around 89 percent of turnover.</p>
<p>But share prices of three of the four heavyweights remained</p>
<p>unchanged, as they held to a resistance level.</p>
<p>&quot;High-caps had drifted rather high and buyers continued to</p>
<p>show reluctance to pay more,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>He said he expected first-tier stocks to ease down next</p>
<p>week, also on profit-taking.</p>
<p>First-tier chemical plants Azomures and Oltchim,</p>
<p>as well as pharmaceuticals company Terapia </p>
<p>marked time at closes of 3,700, 2500 and 6,000 lei</p>
<p>respectively. The other pharmaceuticals firm Antibiotice</p>
<p>moved lower 350 lei to end at 5,750.</p>
<p>Turnover was 6.54 billion lei, down from 8.14 billion the</p>
<p>previous day.</p>
<p>The second tier featured lacklustre trading, with a bright</p>
<p>spot from Policolor dye maker, which had more than</p>
<p>355 million lei in turnover and closed 100 lei firmer at 4,200.</p>
<p>Seven second-tier stocks had no trade and three were</p>
<p>suspended pending release of their 1996 results.</p>
<p>Two unofficial bourse indices, the VAB and the BIG, drifted</p>
<p>higher by 2.5 and 2.45 percent respectively from the previous</p>
<p>session. The BIG first-tier index rose by 3.74 percent to</p>
<p>3,381.49 points.</p>
<p>		MAY 9     MAY 8   Week's change  1997 high 1997 low</p>
<p> VAB-Index  978.6     955.1    n.a.*	   1,041.0    262.0</p>
