<p>SUGAR: World market for April 3, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London ended higher on short covering. The May contract closed $2.10 higher at $310.20 per tonne, while August added $1.30 to close at $307.60 per tonne. Raw sugar futures in New York closed slightly higher buoyed by trade buying in May and speculative buying in July. May added 4 points to close at 11.00 cents/lb, while July ended 5 points higher at 10.75 cents/lb. Brazil apparently intends to import no alcohol in 1997/98 which raises the question, whether this will have any impact on sugar production.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS-</p>
<p>BRAZIL - Pedro Cabral, head of the Industry and Commerce Ministry's sugar and alcohol department, said that Brazil will not import any alcohol in 1997/98 and that enough alcohol will be produced to replace production of MTBE in Rio Grande do Sul and also some methanol. He indicated that alcohol production will have priority in 1997/98. In order to meet the goals regarding no imports and replacement production of MTBE and methanol, one or two bn litres more of alcohol will need to be produced than in 1996/97, Cabral said. However, he is confident that cane production will be above last year's 290 mn tonnes and will be sufficient to cover both alcohol and sugar needs.</p>
<p>BRAZIL - Low world market quotations and relatively good prices on the domestic market resulted in a sharp drop in sugar exports in February. Total shipments in that month amounted to no more than 95,005 tonnes, raw value, down from 464,464 tonnes in January and 167,612 tonnes in February 1996. This brought cumulative exports in the first ten months of 1996/97 (May/February) up to 5.065 mn tonnes compared to 5.640 mn tonnes in the corresponding period the previous year. Total exports in 1995/96 amounted to 5.922 mn tonnes against 4.352 mn tonnes in 1994/95. The largest destinations for white sugar in May/February 1996/97 were Nigeria with 432,940 tonnes against 358,610 tonnes, Algeria with 303,350 tonnes, hardly changed from last year's 303,284 tonnes, Egypt with 286,919 tonnes compared to 516,604 tonnes and Russia with 272,449 tonnes, down from 560,251 tonnes. The largest markets for Brazilian raw sugar were the USA with 213,737 tonnes, up from 122,914 tonnes and Russia with 105,300 tonnes compared to 4</p>
<p>EL SALVADOR - According to the Salvadoran Sugar Association the country will reap a record crop of 385,000 tonnes, tel quel, in 1996/97 (November/May) up from the 325,000 tonnes produced the previous year. It is expected that 65 per cent of total production will be sold on the domestic market, while 10 per cent will be exported to the United States and the remaining 25 per cent sold on the world market.</p>
<p>GERMANY - Sugar production in February 1997 amounted to 1,722 tonnes, raw value, which brought cumulative production in the first five months of 1996/97 (October/February) up to 4.544 mn tonnes, up from last year's 4.138 mn tonnes. Total output in 1995/96 amounted to 4.158 mn tonnes against 3.991 mn tonnes in 1994/95. Sugar consumption in February 1997 reached 230,075 tonnes, down from 250,537 tonnes in January but up on the February 1996 figure of 227,240 tonnes. This brought cumulative consumption in October/February 1996/97 up to 1.221 mn tonnes, slightly up on last year's 1.219 mn tonnes. Total consumption in 1995/96 amounted to 3.076 mn tonnes against 2.995 mn tonnes in 1994/95.</p>
<p>SINGAPORE - Sugar imports in November 1996 amounted to 28,725 tonnes, raw value, sharply up on last year's 11,684 tonnes. This brought cumulative imports in the first eleven months of 1996 (January/November) up to 282,776 tonnes compared to 241,833 tonnes in January/November 1995. Total imports in 1995 amounted to 271,334 tonnes compared to 285,420 tonnes in 1994. Major countries of origin in January/November 1996 were Thailand with 80,000 tonnes raws against 8,040 tonnes, Australia with 60,001 tonnes, down from 154,014 tonnes, and Malaysia with 59,172 tonnes whites compared to 47,598 tonnes. Sugar exports in January/November 1996 reached 10,055 tonnes, down from 19,781 tonnes in 1995. Total exports in 1995 amounted to 22,136 tonnes against 23,391 tonnes in 1994. The largest destination for white sugar from Singapore in 1996 was Brunei with 2,117 tonnes against 1,644 tonnes.</p>
