<title>FRANCE: Zaire's Mobutu arrives in France.</title>
<headline>Zaire's Mobutu arrives in France.</headline>
<dateline>NICE 1997-01-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko arrived in southern France on Thursday to consult doctors about his health, leaving his African nation at a time of crisis over a rebel uprising.</p>
<p>Mobutu's private airplane landed at the airport in the Riviera capital Nice at around 1.15 p.m. (1215 GMT), airport officials said. In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said the Zairean head of state had a three-month visa.  </p>
<p>Mobutu had previously spent six weeks at his palatial villa in the nearby Riviera town of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in November and December following treatment for prostate cancer in Switzerland.</p>
<p>On his return to Zaire three weeks ago, he carried out a major reshuffle in the government and the army high command in preparation for an intended counter-attack on positions captured by rebels holding a large tract of eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>The rebels, led by longtime Mobutu opponent Laurent Kabila, have vowed to march to Kinshasa to overthrow the president, who has ruled the mineral-rich country for 31 years.</p>
<p>Mobutu flew to France from his jungle palace at Gbadolite, where he stayed for much of the time after returning on December 17 to a huge welcome by well over 100,000 inhabitants of the capital, Kinshasa.</p>
