<title>USA: U.S. cash crudes - sour differentials tumble.</title>
<headline>U.S. cash crudes - sour differentials tumble.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>U.S. cash crude prices were weaker across the board Wednesday, with West Texas Sour/Midland (WTS) seeing a sharply lower differential while Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James continued to edge higher.</p>
<p>Traders said that WTS had become too expensive and a number of developments pulled the rug from under its price in the last few days.</p>
<p>Having traded at around $1.05 under benchmark West Texas Intermediate/Cushing (WTI) late last week, WTS traded down from $1.24 under early Wednesday to $1.35 under late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;A dollar under was way too expensive and a number of people found alternatives, switched to sweet grades,&quot; said a dealer at a major MidWest trading firm.</p>
<p>Other traders said that, while not an immediate factor, developments in Baghdad which appeared to bring closer the resumption of Iraqi crude exports weighed on the sour sector. Also, an abundance of Canadian heavy crude supply was a factor.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's going back toward $2.65, $2.80 under this quarter, next quarter and into next year,&quot; said a Houston crude broker. WTS slumped early in the year amid heavy supply and was trading below $2.50 during February and March before rebounding.</p>
<p>September WTS was trading around $1.60 below WTI on Wednesday.</p>
<p>WTI August futures lost 27 cents during regular trading and ended at $19.46 a barrel, largely the result of a bearish American Petroleum Institute stocks report on Tuesday. The August/September contango widend a few cents to around 13 cents.</p>
<p>The LLS differential firmed up another couple of cents as the July North Sea Brent remained relatively expensive and in anticipation of lower August Brent supply.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll probably remain strong 'cause the arb has shut right down,&quot; said a trader for a large commodities trading firm. &quot;Brent has to weaken or LLS has to go up.&quot;</p>
<p>LLS traded up to 25 cents over WTI on Wednesday, a gain of about 50 cents for the differential over the past month.</p>
