<p>German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Friday it has filed a complaint with the European Court of Justice in its bitter dispute with the European Commission over subsidies paid for an east German plant.</p>
<p>VW, Europe's largest carmaker, said the complaint was in response to the European Commission's decision in June to block a portion of the subsidies it has received from the German state of Saxony.  </p>

<p>The German government also said on Thursday it would file a complaint with the Luxembourg court. But Bonn said its decision to file the suit before a Sept 16 deadline did not block efforts to reach a solution with Brussels.</p>
<p>The European Commission agreed last week to a compromise. The deal calls for the 91 million marks of subisides in dispute to be approved in return for Bonn to block an equal amount of federal aid that has been approved but not yet paid out.</p>
<p>Talks to reach a solution will continue between Bonn and Brussels and Germany said it could withdraw its complaint if a mutually agreeable solution was found.</p>
<p>The powerful carmaker, who countered the Brussels ruling in June by threatening to end its investment in the region already plagued by high unemployment, did not say in a statement whether it would withdraw its complaint if a deal were reached.</p>
