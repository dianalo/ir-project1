<p>East Timor activist and Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta urged Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday to raise human rights issues when he visits Jakarta later this week.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not asking Japan to impose economic sanctions against Indonesia...but there is no conflict between having economic relations with a country...and being very forceful in raising the issue of human rights,&quot; Horta told a news conference in Tokyo on the eve of Hashimoto's departure for a tour of Indonesia and four other Southeast Asian states.</p>
<p>The winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize called upon Hashimoto to raise what he described as widespread and systematic torture, killings and woundings of East Timorese carried out by the Indonesian army when he meets President Suharto on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like Prime Minister Hashimoto to raise the issue of East Timor in the same way (U.S.) President Clinton and (Germany's) Chancellor Kohl, among other world leaders, have done,&quot; Horta said.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan has done the least among all developed countries,&quot; the exiled independence activist said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Jakarta's leading source of development assistance, extended $886 million in aid, loans and technical assistance to Indonesia in 1995.</p>
<p>Horta told reporters Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda had refused to meet him during his visit to Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;They said they were too busy with the Lima hostage crisis,&quot; he said, referring to the 19-day-old seizure of the Japanese ambassador's residence by Peruvian leftist rebels.</p>
<p>Horta said there were at least 1,000 East Timorese political prisoners being held by the Indonesian government, in addition to what he called &quot;private prisoners&quot; held by the Indonesian army.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides the official, registered prisoners...there are prisoners of battalions... Almost every battalion, company or platoon has two, three or 10 prisoners who have no protection from the International Red Cross. They are tortured, mistreated and work as slaves within the army.&quot;</p>
<p>There are up to 25,000 Indonesian troops stationed in East Timor, he said.</p>
<p>He also called for an end to the transmigration of Indonesians into East Timor. Up to 200,000 Indonesians have moved into East Timor since Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in December 1975, Horta said.</p>
<p>Indonesia declared East Timor its 27th province in July 1976, an act not recognised by the United Nations which still regards Portugal as the territory's administering power.</p>
<p>Up to 250,000 East Timorese died in the early years of occupation, he said.</p>
<p>Horta said six years of United Nations negotiations between Indonesia and Portugal failed because of resistance from hardliners in the Indonesian army.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreign minister and others have no power whatsoever... The problem in East Timor and Indonesia is that certain people who call themselves the army have too much power and too many guns.&quot;</p>
<p>Horta said he was hopeful newly appointed United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan of Ghana would put human rights and territorial integrity at the top of a reformed U.N. agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a great respect for the new secretary-general who comes from a country which has always supported the struggle of peoples for self-determination.&quot;</p>
