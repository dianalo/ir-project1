<p>Colgate-Palmolive Co said Tuesday it had promoted two senior executives as part of a restructuring of its global management.</p>
<p>The executives will head the newly created High Growth Markets and Developed Markets regions, which together encompass all Colgate operations.</p>
<p>Both executives will report to William Shanahan, Colgate president and chief operating officer. The appointments are effective March 1.  </p>
<p>David Metzler was named executive vice president and chief of operations of High Growth Markets. Previously he was president of Colgate's European operations.</p>
<p>Metzler will be responsible for all Colgate operations in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Africa and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Lois Juliber was named executive vice president and chief of operations of Developed Markets. She will be responsible for operations in North America and Europe. Most recently Juliber was president of Colgate North America.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are refining our organizational structure to reflect Colgate's excellent prospects for growth in both the developing and the developed worlds,&quot; said Reuben Mark, chairman and chief executive of the consumer products company.</p>
<p>&quot;This new organizational structure...will better enable us to develop and implement tailored strategies and best business practices for each region, leading to enhanced overall profitability, speed and flexibility and in turn, continued growth and value creation for all Colgate stakeholders.&quot;</p>
<p>The former jobs of Metzler and Juliber will be filled soon, the company said.</p>
