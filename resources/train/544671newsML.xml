<title>BELGIUM: Belgian Uniwear eyes more acquisitions.</title>

<p>Belgian textile holdings company Uniwear SA said on Monday it was looking out for more acquisition targets in the textile and leather industries.</p>
<p>The company said earlier this month it was likely to announce an acquisition at Monday's results conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Several (possible) acquisitions are being looked at at the same time,&quot; Uniwear managing director Andrea Cattaneo Della Volta told a news conference to present 1996 results. &quot;We'd rather wait until we're sure (before signing a deal).</p>
<p>He said that since Uniwear's 288 million franc capital increase in March it would be easier to finance a buy, and that Uniwear was interested in targets with turnaround potential.</p>
<p>Uniwear aims to develop its flax division by acquisitions or collaboration with other companies active in the sector to boost market share and increase its range of products.</p>
<p>&quot;A pick up (in the flax sector) is already visible. Prices should rise in the second half of the year,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>In its children's socks and stockings activities the group wanted to control production costs, reduce fixed costs and increase its market. &quot;To this efect takeovers of other companies in the sector are envisaged,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The leather division was winning market share, it noted.</p>
<p>Uniwear said its goal was also to increase its market capitalisation to 1.5 billion francs from 850 million currently to attract interest from institutional investors.</p>
<p>Group net profit rose to 30.5 million francs in 1996 from 5.7 million in 1995. U.K. hosiery manufacturer and distributor Pex plc, in which Uniwear bought a stake in January 1996, made net profit of 24.5 million francs after 116.1 million loss, with productivity boosted by new machines.</p>
