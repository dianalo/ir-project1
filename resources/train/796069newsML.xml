<p>Zimbabwean shares strengthened in active trade on Wednesday but brokers said they might soften towards the end of the week on a resumption of profit-taking which characterised the market last week before the long weekend break.</p>
<p>The main 57-counter industrial index rose 23.03 points to end Wednesday at 12,058.54.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the interest has been in the second liners because they have just been lying around. The blue-chips have had a good run and buyers are now looking somewhere else where they still see value and they are finding in the second liners,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I still think the market might come off still because there's nothing to make it run and I think we will see profit-taking continuing this week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the main industrials board on Wednesday, cement producer Circem jumped 105 cents up to 700, furniture and clothing retailer Haddon and Sly rose 60 cents to 460, winery Cairns gained 35 cents to 660 and publishing group Zimpapers added five cents to 175.</p>
<p>Flour and maize miller Natfoods bucked the trend, dropping 75 cents to 750.</p>
<p>Minings were quieter with gold producer Falcon leaping 400 cents to 1,400 on the back of a firmer bullion fixing in London.</p>
<p>The seven-share mining index put on 8.11 points to close at 926.07.</p>
