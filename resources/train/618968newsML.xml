<p>French Socialist party leader Lionel Jospin on Tuesday said he did not plan to privatise France Telecom and a planned consultation of the company's staff would only be used to advise the government.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the staff of France Telecom who decide on the privatisation of a very large company. That is a decision of the state, of the public powers,&quot; Jospin told Europe 1 radio.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position is not to privatise France Telecom,&quot; he added. &quot;We are currently in a process which has started. The staff, faced with a government and a boss which wants to privatise France Telecom, will formulate an answer which is valid at a given moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In another situation, with an authority which reacts differently on this point, I am not sure their opinion will be the same because they know that the process is not the same,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We could very well ask (staff) their opinion, it will be an element that enters into the decision, no more,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The outgoing government planned to sell a 30 to 35 percent stake in a first share offer and pledged to keep 51 percent in the telecommunications operator.</p>
<p>Analysts expects a government of Socialists and Communists to postpone the sale by a few months but not to cancel it altogether.</p>
