<headline>German DAX ends bourse trade at higher levels.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>German shares ended bourse trade on Wednesday at higher levels, reaping the benefits of a higher close on Wall Street overnight, but with sentiment muted by the weaker dollar.</p>
<p>The DAX-30 index of leading German shares ended 25.77 points, 0.77 percent, higher at 3,353.45 after trying to catch up with Tuesday's post-bourse rally.</p>
<p>June DAX futures were a point higher at 3,374.0 early on, but they fell sharply over the session before recovering to stand at 3,364 points, down nine.</p>
<p>With turnover low and even 1996 result details from industrial giant Daimler-Benz AG, maker of Mercedes vehicles, failing to excite the market, trade was firmly range-bound over the session.</p>
<p>The DAX index was unable to breake out of a range between 3,345 and 3,368 points over the session.</p>
<p>Dealers said new result details released from Daimler-Benz were viewed positively but not with the same enthusiasm that greeted recent figures from BMW. Upgrades were nonetheless expected to result from an analyst meeting later today.</p>
<p>Daimler's shares ended bourse at 138.15 points, up 1.25 marks, having earlier reached an all-time of 142.40.</p>
<p>Dealers said a move by the group to issue 1.1 billion marks in mandatory convertible notes to strengthen its capital base was not being seen positively.</p>
<p>Drugs group Schwarz Pharma, which late Tuesday said group net profits rose 14.4 percent in 1996 and further a profit growth was expected in 1997, rose 3.50 marks to 137.00, but ended the day down 2.80 marks at 130.</p>
<p>Luxury carmaker Porsche AG was among the chief winners over the session after U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers urged its clients to switch to it from other car stocks.</p>
<p>Porsche ended the day up 120 marks, 5.91 percent, at 1,150 marks.</p>
