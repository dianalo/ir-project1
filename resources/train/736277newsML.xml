<headline>&quot;Snake eater&quot; to head U.S. military forces.</headline>

<p>Army Gen. Henry Shelton, a tall paratrooper named by President Bill Clinton to become chairman of the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff, is imposing in special forces green beret and combat boots.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old Army Ranger heads the Pentagon's Special Operations Command and Clinton said on Thursday that he nominated Shelton because of his expertise in post-Cold War challenges ranging from anti-terrorism to peacekeeping.</p>
<p>Shelton is known as a &quot;snake eater&quot; along with other members of U.S. special forces trained to slog through swamp and jungle on hush-hush missions. A veteran of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars, he is highly regarded by his 47,000 elite Army, Navy and Air Force forces troops.</p>
<p>If approved by the Senate to succeed Army Gen. John Shalikashvili on Oct. 1 as the nation's top military officer, the 34-year veteran would jump from leading a small slice of U.S. forces to running the whole show from the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The decision by Clinton and Defence Secretary William Cohen to pick Shelton over higher profile candidates reflects the new U.S. military, called on increasingly after the Cold War to perform missions from peacekeeping to civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>&quot;Through long experiences in special operations, he ... brings to this job a unique perspective in addressing the broad range of challenges we face on the brink of a new century -- from war fighting to peace keeping, from conventional threats to newer threats like the spread of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&quot;You get a lot of bang for the buck&quot; with special forces, Shelton is fond of telling anyone about his Army Green Berets and psychological operations troops, Navy Seals, and Air Force special tactics and para-rescue personnel.</p>
<p>Shelton served two tours of duty as a special forces and airborne officer in the jungles of Vietnam and as assistant commander of the 101st Airborne Division during the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.</p>
<p>The general, also a former commander of the famed 82nd Airborne Division, has travelled extensively in the past year to visit his forces in more than 60 countries around the world.</p>
<p>Shelton headed the U.S. military operation in Haiti three years ago and also has held senior operations posts with the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>He doesn't rest on formality, and prefers to be addressed by his middle name, Hugh.</p>
<p>The motto of Special Operations Command is &quot;Quiet Professionals&quot; and Shelton, who wears his pants tucked into his paratrooper boot tops like other Army special forces troops, is considered a prime example of that.</p>
<p>Cohen's first choice to replace Shalikashvili, Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, withdrew from consideration last month after disclosure of an adulterous affair more than 10 years ago. Ralston is vice chairman of the joint chiefs.</p>
<p>Shelton, a native of Tarboro, North Carolina, did not attend the elite U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Instead, he holds a degree in textile engineering from North Carolina State University and a master's degree from Auburn University in Alabama.</p>
<p>He is married to the former Carolyn Johnson. They have three sons, one a special agent in the Secret Service, another an Army captain and the youngest a student at Florida State University.</p>
<p>Although the backgrounds of all of the remaining candidates for Shalikashvilki's post were carefully checked following the Ralston incident, Cohen told reporters last month that he did not intend to look for &quot;absolute perfection&quot; in a new military leader.</p>
<p>&quot;In Shelton, he got someone unusual and came dammed close to perfection in the process,&quot; a fellow Army general said.</p>
