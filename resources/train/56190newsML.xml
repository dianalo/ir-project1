<p>The Afghan government accused Pakistan on Monday of being behind the rebel Taleban movement and urged Islamabad to &quot;recall its militias&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Afghan government calls upon the parliament, people and Islamic parties in Pakistan to press...certain (Pakistani) circles to call back Pakistan's militias from Afghanistan,&quot; Aziz Murad, President Burhanuddin Rabbani's spokesman, said.</p>
<p>Pakistan denies that it supports the Taleban, which took the eastern city of Jalalabad on Wednesday in its latest drive to topple Rabbani and enforce Islamic law throughout the country.</p>
<p>Afghan government officials say the Taleban could not have captured Jalalabad and border areas without Pakistani support.</p>
<p>&quot;Peace will never return as long as Pakistan continues interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,&quot; Rabbani's top military commander Ahmad Shah Masood said last week.</p>
<p>He was speaking to Marrack Goulding, U.N. under-secretary for political affairs, who was visiting Kabul to explore prospects for a U.N.-brokered peace settlement.</p>
<p>Rancour over the Taleban has soured relations between Pakistan and the Afghan government, although these had improved before the latest Taleban gains in eastern provinces.</p>
<p>The secretary of Pakistan's foreign ministry, Najmuddin Sheikh, is due to go to Kabul on Thursday to reopen a diplomatic mission in temporary premises to replace the embassy that was sacked and burned by a mob of protesters a year ago.</p>
<p>But the latest broadside from Rabbani's spokesman casts doubt on whether Sheikh's visit will go ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;A pre-condition for reopening the mission was that the Kabul government stop its hostile propaganda against us,&quot; said a Pakistani foreign ministry source. &quot;We will decide on Wednesday whether the secretary's visit will take place or not.&quot;</p>
<p>In Jalalabad, where a government air raid killed 12 people and wounded 50 on Sunday, the ruling Taleban shura (council) decided to keep up military operations against the government, the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press agency reported.</p>
<p>It said the Taleban planned to use Jalalabad airport to launch air and missile attacks on government military targets.</p>
<p>The agency said militants of the Sunni Moslem Taleban movement, bent on imposing their purist brand of Islam, had begun destroying music cassettes in Jalalabad and confiscating them from vehicles stopped at checkpoints.</p>
