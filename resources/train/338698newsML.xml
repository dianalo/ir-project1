<headline>LIFFE still in CBOT wheat talks but priority low.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) is still in talks on a wheat contract linkup with Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) but for now the priority was on a planned bond trading CBOT link, LIFFE chief executive Daniel Hodson said.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't stopped conversations but we are focusing as far as the Board of Trade is concerned on this very important event taking place in May,&quot; Hodson said in an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>LIFFE and the CBOT are due to start a link in May which allows LIFFE to trade CBOT Treasury futures and the CBOT to trade LIFFE Bund futures.</p>
<p>THe London Commodity Exchange (LCE) had been in discussions with the CBOT on a wheat link mainly for the European market but those talks were put on hold when LIFFE and the LCE merged in September.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether we continue that contract and bring on a franchise Board of Trade contract alongside it remains to be seen,&quot; Hodson said. &quot;But you shouldn't assume from the silence that the deal is off.&quot;</p>
