<p>U.K. petrol stations selling the Esso brand are planning a conference in London on May 21 to protest the company's Pricewatch campaign, another twist in the retail market that has led to a record number of site closures in the last year.</p>
<p>The Esso Licensed Retailers Association (ELRA), claiming to represent more than 600 of Esso's nearly 2,000 U.K. outlets, said on Friday the conference would tell motorists that the ferocious price war in Great Britain was &quot;against the interests of consumers in the long term.&quot;</p>
<p>The group also alleged that Esso, a unit of U.S. oil giant Exxon Corp, has boosted its operating fees to pay for its Pricewatch campaign, which promises to match its lowest-priced competitors.</p>
<p>&quot;The retailers feel that they are being unreasonably exploited by Esso and that the capital investments put into their businesses will be wiped out with the consequent loss of their livelihoods,&quot; ELRA said in a statement.</p>
<p>Launched in early 1996, Pricewatch exacerbated a cut-throat petrol market in the U.K. where the hypermarkets have been grabbing market share through lower prices, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>Nearly 10 percent, or 1,500, petrol stations closed in the U.K. last year as margins were squeezed and pump prices fell to the lowest in Europe.</p>
<p>ELRA has already filed a complaint against Esso with the European Commission and Parliamentary hearings last year in the U.K. examined whether motorists were enjoying unrealistically low petrol prices and whether the industry needed to be regulated.</p>
