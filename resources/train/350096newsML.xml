<p>After a lacklustre campaign, Pakistanis prepared to vote in Monday elections which Benazir Bhutto's main rival Nawaz Sharif is expected to win.</p>
<p>Sharif, saying he was counting on a comfortable majority in the National Assembly elections, said on Sunday tackling dire economic problems would be his first priority as prime minister.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in an interview in his home city of Lahore that repairing the economy would be a long, difficult task, but he was confident Pakistan could become an &quot;Asian Tiger&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is in very bad shape because of the mismanagement of the Benazir Bhutto government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>President Farooq Leghari sacked Bhutto's government on November 5 on disputed charges of corruption and misrule, but the caretaker government he appointed has failed to nail any leading politicians or bar them from standing for election.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) denied a report by London's Sunday Times that she might seek asylum in Britain if she lost the elections.</p>
<p>&quot;It's rubbish,&quot; the spokesman told the official APP news agency. &quot;She has got to play a historic role in the politics of Pakistan and she will never flee the country.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sunday Times had quoted senior Pakistani government sources as saying that corruption charges against Bhutto and her jailed husband Asif Ali Zardari would be dropped if she agreed to leave the country and abandon politics.</p>
<p>Bhutto and Zardari, who is held on a charge of conspiring in the murder of his wife's estranged brother Murtaza in September, have denied any wrongdoing, saying they are victims of a plot.</p>
<p>Sharif's previous government was dismissed on corruption charges but was restored by the Supreme Court, only to lose power again two months later. His Pakistan Muslim League party lost the October 1993 polls to the PPP.</p>
<p>Last week, the Supreme Court upheld Leghari's dismissal of Bhutto, saying there was enough evidence of corruption, nepotism and other abuses for him to have fired her.</p>
<p>Corruption has been the main issue in a campaign that has failed to excite Pakistanis, many of whom are disillusioned by the perceived misdeeds of a rapacious political class.</p>
<p>Imran Khan, Pakistan's former cricket captain, was the first to focus public attention on the issue, but polls suggest his Tehrik-i-Insaaf (Justice Movement) is unlikely to win more than a few seats, if any, in the 217-member National Assembly.</p>
<p>Sharif, an industrialist, promised to strengthen a commission set up by the caretaker government to root out graft.</p>
<p>&quot;This Accountability Commission is an independent body. We will try to make it free of any government influence so that any citizen can go to it with a petition and the commissioner is free to take action,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said a Sharif government would not target Bhutto or Zardari. &quot;We will never indulge in any politics of revenge,&quot; he said, but later blamed Zardari for many of Pakistan's woes.</p>
<p>&quot;Zardari was running the country, including the financial institutions. He was effectively de facto prime minister.&quot;</p>
<p>Sharif ended his campaign after a night-time parade through Lahore's old city that looked like a victory march, with thousands of people packing muddy lanes despite steady rain.</p>
<p>Men let off fireworks in the streets while women threw rose petals from balconies.</p>
<p>Tension mounted in the violence-prone port city of Karachi after stone-throwing clashes between supporters of rival factions of the ethnic Mohajir National Movement (MQM).</p>
<p>Witnesses said several people were hurt in Saturday's trouble in Landhi, bastion of the breakaway MQM-Haqiqi faction.</p>
<p>The mainstream MQM, led by self-exiled Altaf Hussain, expects to win a dozen seats in Karachi and could play a key role in post-election bargaining if no party gains a clear majority for any party. The MQM boycotted the 1993 polls.</p>
