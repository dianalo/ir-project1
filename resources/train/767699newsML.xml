<p>Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz vowed on Wednesday to defy Islamist pressure to scrap religious education changes at the centre of a wider dispute between Turkey's Islamists and secularists.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is completely committed to carrying out the education reforms,&quot; Yilmaz told a news conference in parliament.</p>
<p>Police using dogs, water cannon and batons on Tuesday broke up a demonstration of around 6,000 Islamists in Ankara against government plans to curtail religious high schools.</p>
<p>At least 11 people were wounded when police repeatedly baton-charged protesters and journalists.</p>
<p>Yilmaz said the Islamists, narrowly denied political power by his uneasy alliance of secularists, would get nowhere with shows of force on the streets.</p>
<p>&quot;They are mistaken if they think they can intimidate the republic's government with street protests, threats and blackmail,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Education reform is the most serious policy challenge facing Yilmaz since he took office in late June at the head of a left-right coalition formed to keep the Islamists from power.</p>
<p>He has taken up an army call for secularist education to be boosted to eight years from five in reforms that would close many religious schools, known as Imam Hatips.</p>
<p>Previous prime minister Necmettin Erbakan, the first Islamist to rule modern Turkey, resigned in June under pressure from the secularist army to crack down on Islamist activism. Curtailing religious education was a key army demand.</p>
<p>Yilmaz accused Erbakan's Islam-based Welfare Party, the biggest single grouping in parliament, of using the schools to raise supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The Welfare Party wants to protect these institutions, which produce militants for it,&quot; he said. Many of Erbakan's close aides graduated from Imam Hatips.</p>
<p>The schools were set up decades ago to train would-be Moslem clerics but they have expanded well beyond their original remit. Around 500,000 Turkish children now attend some 560 Imam Hatips.</p>
<p>The government plans to halve to three years the period that a pupil can spend at a religious school in a bill due to go before MPs for approval within two weeks.</p>
<p>Welfare's official organ, the Milli Gazete newspaper, sounded a warning of further opposition to the education reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Education has turned into a social bomb because of the way it is being handled. This bill will set off the bomb,&quot; the paper said in an editorial. &quot;The nation will not accept this bill.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts say Islamist anger at the government, secularist President Suleyman Demirel and the military will rise if the constitutional court bans Welfare in a case expected to be resolved in the autumn.</p>
<p>The country's top prosecutor has called for Welfare to be outlawed for its alleged threat to Turkey's official secularism.</p>
<p>The military, which has described its fight against Islamists as a matter of &quot;life or death&quot;, has given written testimony against Welfare to the court.</p>
<p>Bearded protesters, wearing baggy trousers and skullcaps in Turkish Moslem style, chanted Islamist slogans outside the military headquarters in Tuesday's demonstration. Army sharpshooters looked on from the roof of the building.</p>
<p>Journalists staged a protest in Istanbul against the beating of their colleagues by police during the demonstration.</p>
<p>Around 200 reporters gathered outside the headquarters of the Turkish journalists' association in Istanbul shouting: &quot;The free press will not be silenced&quot;.</p>
<p>Five journalists were taken to hospital after being attacked by both police and protesters.</p>
