<headline>Greek shares end higher but volume falls.</headline>

<p>Greek shares settled with mild 0.46 percent gains in narrow trade after a technical problem stopped trading and early trades were annulled.</p>
<p>Volume also fell to 2.5 billion drachmas as several brokers were barred from trading after failing to meet tight settlement regulations.</p>
<p>Soon after the session opened the electronic screen-based system went erratic and trading stopped. All early trades were nulled. The day's official trading started at 13:15 local and ended two hours later.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't a normal session. We started late and a lot of retail clients did not know that the session would take place at a later time. Volume was quite low with mostly banks trading firmer,&quot; said a floor trader.</p>
<p>Greece will cut its marker 12-month T-bill rate by 50 basis points down to 11.50 percent in December, it said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The general index closed up 0.46 percent or 4.19 points at 911.96 from Monday's 907.77 close after opening at 908.44. Turnover fell to 2.56 billion drachmas from 3.49 billion on Monday on volume of 1.2 million shares.</p>
