<title>USA: Centennial sued by shareholder.</title>
<headline>Centennial sued by shareholder.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A shareholder lawsuit was filed against Centennial Technologies Inc alleging securities law violations after Tuesday news that Centennial was checking the accuracy of earnings it reported for the quarter ended December 31 and financial statements for prior periods.  </p>
<p>Company officials did not return repeated calls for comment.</p>
<p>In a statement, the law firm Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach said a lawsuit seeking class-action status was filed in U.S. District Court for Massachusetts on behalf of persons or entities who bought Centennial common from August 21, 1996, through and including February 10, 1997.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that Centennial misrepresented material information concerning revenues and net earnings for, at least, its fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, reported on August 21, 1996, and its quarterly reporting periods for the first and second quarters of 1997.</p>
<p>In particular, the complaint alleges that Centennial reported revenues and net earnings which were artificially inflated and materially overstated during the class period.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, the company announced it had &quot;undertaken an inquiry into the accuracy of its reported earnings for the second fiscal quarter of 1997, ended Dec. 31, 1996, and financial statements for prior periods.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock closed Monday at 16-3/8 Monday and did not open as of late trading Tuesday.</p>
