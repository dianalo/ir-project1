<text>
<p>Lithuanian blue chips bounced back in light trade on Friday and dealers said more gains were looming on the horizon.</p>
<p>The Litin A index clawed its way back over the 2,600 mark, edging up 43.47 points to 2,617.37 in central market trade worth 1.31 million litas.</p>
<p>The index is still a long way off its high in mid-January of 3,242.25.</p>
<p>Gainers included Lithuania Sea Shipping Company, which rose ten percent to 7.59 litas in trade of almost 114,000 litas.</p>
<p>The state-run company on Friday reported that its 1996 net profit was 55.8 million litas and that it would pay out a dividend of 16.5 million litas.</p>
<p>&quot;That news may have pushed its price up today, but it probably won't go much higher,&quot; one dealer told Reuters.</p>
<p>Other gainers included Vilniaus Bank, which saw its ordinary shares advance 2.22 percent to 230 litas in trade volume of 11,500 litas.</p>
<p>The bank's shares had eased in mid-week despite its Monday announcement that its 1996 net profit had soared to 24.4 million litas from 2.9 million litas the previous year.</p>
<p>Rokishkis Cheese also shot up in strong demand, rising to 47.00 litas from 44.95 litas in turnover of 404,000 litas.</p>
<p>The company is considered to be one of the best managed in the country and is carving a niche for itself in overseas markets, making it look like a good buy, dealers said.</p>
<p>It has caught the eye of big league foreign investors like Williams de Broe, which bought a stake in it earlier this year.</p>
<p>Electronics components producer Vilniaus Vingis price was unchanged at 5.90 litas in trade of almost 50,000 litas but dealers said its price looked set to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;One or two big shareholders want to sell their stake right now, so there is a big supply of its shares,&quot; said Arvydas Jacikevicius of brokerage firm Suprema.</p>
<p>&quot;When those shares get sold, its price will probably go up quite a bit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers also said that Hermis Bank's shares will probably rise when they are traded again. Trade in its shares has been suspended temporarily pending its general shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>The bank reported on Thursday that its 1996 net profit had leapt to over 27 million litas after a loss of over eight million litas in 1995.</p>
<p>Block trades amounted to over 2.6 million litas.</p>
