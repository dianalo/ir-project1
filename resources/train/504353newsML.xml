<p>China's benchmark retail price inflation could slow more quickly than expected in 1997, to three to four percent for the year, an official of the State Planning Commission Economic Research Institute said on Friday.  </p>
<p>The rate of inflation was much better than the government had forecast, Chen Dezhong, director of the institute, told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>China has set a target of 6.0 percent for retail price inflation this year, compared with 6.1 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>When this target was set, economic planners were taking into account several potential fluctuations in prices, but no large fluctuations had occurred in the first quarter, Chen said.</p>
<p>He attributed the stability in prices to good spring weather that had ensured a plentiful supply of agricultural products.</p>
<p>China's retail price inflation averaged 2.6 percent for the first quarter, and was up by a year-on-year 1.7 percent for March, the State Statistical Bureau said.</p>
