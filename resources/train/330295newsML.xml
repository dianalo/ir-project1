<p>The trial of a Brazilian soap opera actor accused of murdering his screen lover neared its conclusion on Friday amid frenzied media attention.</p>
<p>Guilherme de Padua and his ex-wife Paula Thomaz stand separately accused of murdering actress Daniela Perez four years ago by stabbing her repeatedly with a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>Judge Jose Geraldo Antonio suspended the trial for more than an hour after defence attorney Paulo Ramalho ignored five warnings to tone down his interrogation of a witness.</p>
<p>Brazil's equivalent of the O.J. Simpson trial has attracted mobs of journalists and a public following. Outside the court, protesters covered the sidewalk with banners proclaiming &quot;Justice for Daniela&quot; and &quot;Stop impunity now!&quot; alongside a photograph of the body of the slain actress.</p>
<p>Millions of soap apera fans have followed the twists and turns of the murder case as faithfully as the episodes of &quot;De Corpo e Alma&quot; (Of Body And Soul), the drama penned by Perez's mother Gloria Perez in which de Padua rose to fame.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old former male stripper became a celebrity as the brooding screen boyfriend of sexy teenager Yasmin, played by Daniela Perez. He originally confessed to murdering Perez, who was 22 at the time, but later said Thomaz carried out the stabbing in a fit of jealousy. The two divorced shortly after de Padua was jailed pending trial.</p>
<p>The 1992 killing eclipsed news of the impeachment of then President Fernando Collor and spawned calls for a crackdown in Brazil's justice system, which often turns a blind eye to the crimes of the rich and famous.</p>
<p>De Padua could walk free despite confessing in a book and in court that he strangled Perez until she lost consciousness and later disposed of the murder weapon. The wording of the accusation means he can be found guilty only if the jury of seven is convinced he actually carried out the stabbing.</p>
<p>De Padua and 23-year-old Thomaz, who will stand trial in April, face a maximum of 30 years in jail if convicted. But under Brazilian law first-time offenders can be released after serving a sixth of their sentence. Both defendants have already spent the past four years behind bars.</p>
<p>Lawyers said a verdict was possible as early as Saturday.</p>
