<p>A million looted guns in private hands cast a dark shadow over Albania as it seeks to attract foreign investors to help rebuild the chaotic Balkan country.</p>
<p>As a new Socialist-led government prepares to take over in Europe's poorest state, all sides agree its first priority must be to restore law and order and disarm gangs currently terrorising large parts of the land, particularly in the south.</p>
<p>These gangs sprang up after Albanians, outraged by the collapse of shady pyramid savings schemes earlier this year, rose up against the government blamed for allowing them to flourish, looting army weapons depots as demoralised troops watched or joined in.</p>
<p>As the outgunned police vanished from the streets armed civilians went on an orgy of looting and vandalism, destroying much of what had been built up in a modest economic boom since the fall of communism in 1990.</p>
<p>A Swiss-owned flour producer saw its Tirana warehouse emptied in March as civilians used their newly-acquired weapons to stock up on staple food for the looming crisis.</p>
<p>Greek firms operating in Albania suffered losses estimated by the Greek-Albanian Business Association at up to 5 billion drachmas ($18 million), in theft, damage and lost production.</p>
<p>FUTURE SECURITY</p>
<p>While the thought of a Kalashnikov in every Albanian bedroom is enough to make most potential investors nervous, foreign diplomats and businessman based in Albania are reasonably optimistic about the future security situation.</p>
<p>They believe that once law and order is restored with a properly functioning police force back on the streets, the criminal minority using the weapons for profit will be isolated from the majority of law-abiding citizens who picked up a gun for self-protection.</p>
<p>&quot;Without law and order, you don't have any illegal behaviour,&quot; one diplomat said. &quot;You can walk through Tirana now brandishing a Kalashnikov and no one will stop you. Imagine what it's like outside the capital.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they'll ever get all the guns back,&quot; another senior Western diplomat told Reuters, noting that Albanians had a long tradition of self-protection and settling inter-clan blood feuds with arms.</p>
<p>Visitors to isolated communities in the mountainous north of the country since the fall of communism have told of villagers proudly showing off rifles from World War Two and earlier, lovingly oiled and wrapped in oilskins and buried during four decades of Stalinist rule.</p>
<p>Diplomats believe some weapons have already been dispersed, to the large Albanian minority in the Serbian province of Kosovo, to other ethnic Albanians in the neighbouring former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, and to organised crime via the black market.</p>
<p>European governments are discussing plans to try to recover at least some of the others by confiscating them or buying them back, though this could be very costly.</p>
<p>&quot;Buying them back is certainly one option, but you could never be sure of getting them all,&quot; one diplomat said. &quot;A family with three would give you back two.&quot;</p>
<p>INCENTIVES</p>
<p>Another idea is to offer incentives to regional and town councils in the form of additional aid and investment based on their success in recovering looted weapons.</p>
<p>These are among the ideas to be discussed at a meeting of European Union officials this month in Rome, to prepare for a high-level meeting in September to work out a programme for reconstructing the country.</p>
<p>One foreign businessman actively involved in Albania, Zakaria Rashed of Mak Albania, an offshoot of the Kuwaiti-based M.A. Kharafi Group, said it was Europe's duty to help restore order by providing Albania's police with training, communications systems, weapons and transport.</p>
<p>&quot;Once order is restored 70 percent of the population will ask themselves why they need to keep a gun at home,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;After all it's a dangerous pastime -- most of the 1,500 people who died in the unrest were killed accidentally.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile his company is taking no chances. At an exclusive tourist development Mak Albania is building on the Adriatic coast near Durres, some 40 km (25 miles) west of Tirana, it has engaged a 30-strong private security force after losing some material in last March's looting.</p>
<p>A few kilometres (miles) down the coast the privately owned beachside hotel Apollonia also hired their own gunmen, and managed to hold off the looters.</p>
<p>The luxury state-owned hotel Adriatik next door, reserved for foreigners and top party officials during four decades of communist rule, was not so lucky. Lacking the funds or foresight to protect itself, it was gutted and vandalised by looters in March. ($ = 277.2 Greek Drachmas)</p>
