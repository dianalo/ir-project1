<p>Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European Commission on Wednesday:</p>
<p>Spokesman Joao Vale de Almeida said the agenda of Thursday's Commission meeting would include preferential accords with third countries in the framework of the World Trade Organisation and an orientation debate on flexibility and reinforced cooperation within the inter-governmental conference.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida announced a briefing following Portuguese Republic President Jorge Sampaio's visit to the Commission, at 1430/1330 GMT in the Breydel's VIP corner.</p>
<p>Spokesman Jochen Kubosch said the Court of Justice upheld a 1992 Commission decision rejecting the complaint against the French post office and the French state concerning the international express courier market.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida said Commission President Jacques Santer was very pleased about the Israel-Palestinian agreement on Hebron. He said that the Commission would remain involved in the peace process and that it would strive for the respect of the agreement.</p>
<p>Regarding the British Airways (BA)/American Airlines alliance, spokesman Willy Helin said close cooperation between the Commission and the British authorities was needed to solve the actual dispute. British authorities should take their time, pay attention and be aware of the risks they would run by taking contradictory measures on parallel procedures, he said.</p>
<p>In answer to a question, Helin said article 89 of the EU Treaty gave the Commission the right to block the BA/American Airlines alliance.</p>
<p>Helin also announced a news conference by Commissioner Karel Van Miert on several issues on Wednesday January 22.</p>
