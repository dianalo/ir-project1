<title>UK: London record leads Euro bourses, dollar firm.</title>
<headline>London record leads Euro bourses, dollar firm.</headline>

<p>The London stock market hit a new peak in morning business on Monday, boosted by a record Wall Street close, and the Frankfurt and Paris bourses also gained.</p>
<p>On the currency markets, the dollar was in good form but traded a little below a 45-month peak of 116.20 yen touched in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>Concern about the weakness of the Japanese economy and its sagging stock market put more pressure on the yen, with movements exaggerated by thin end-of-year markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar-yen seems to be very well bid. But to be honest, there has not been much action,&quot; said a trader at one British bank. &quot;Markets are thin. What will happen is anyone's guess but dollar-yen looks set to carry on going strong.&quot;</p>
<p>While many other major stock markets have hit new highs this year, Tokyo ended its final trading day of the year below its level of a year ago. The Nikkei average closed at 19,361.35, down 7.69 points on the day and around 500 below its 1995 close.</p>
<p>In contrast, the London stock market, Europe's busiest, was aided by higher futures and bonds and takeover speculation. It moved into uncharted territory despite a negative influence of 3.9 points from shares quoted after their dividend payments.</p>
<p>U.S. shares quoted in London were also mostly firmer.  &quot;We should see the Dow start higher again today -- the market is quite confident,&quot; one market-maker in U.S. stocks said.</p>
<p>On Wall Street the 30-share Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.23 to 6,560.91 on Friday.</p>
<p>But traders said volume on both sides of the Atlantic was expected to remain thin with the New Year holiday in mid- week.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose there will be more people around than there were last week but no one wants to get too involved before the New Year's holiday,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;There aren't enough people around to make a game.&quot;</p>
<p>Speculation that British Aerospace would merge with another aerospace or defence group resurfaced. BAe shares gained 38.5 pence to 12.64 pounds. Shares in retailers also gained as investors hoped stores would report bumper sales for Christmas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, strength in the dollar -- good news for exporters -- helped encourage the Frankfurt bourse on its final session of the year but some dealers were kept away due to heavy snow.</p>
<p>&quot;This is real end of the year stuff, turnover is thin and everyone is trying to keep clean books. We're also closing early, which won't help volumes, and a lot of people didn't make it because of the snow,&quot; said one Frankfurt broker.</p>
<p>French shares also took their cue for a rise from Wall Street, a stronger franc and higher bonds but trading was quiet.</p>
<p>Currency traders said the market was concerned whether Japan could sustain its already anaemic economic recovery into 1997, when tax rises will drain funds and public spending will slow.</p>
<p>For traders at work and on the watch for clues on the strength of the U.S. economy, U.S. leading November indicators and existing home sales are due at 1330 and 1500 GMT, respectively.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1200 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.5565 marks and 116.05 yen, compared with Friday's late European rates of 1.5556 and 115.60.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1200 GMT</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 18.5 points at 4,109.5 after earlier hitting a record 4,111.1.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt the 30-share DAX index was 4.39 higher at 2,857.27 but below earlier highs. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 7.53 at 2,314.48.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was quoted around $369.75 an ounce after a morning fix of $369.60 and Friday's London close of $369.55. Silver eased two cents to $4.89.</p>
