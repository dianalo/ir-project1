<p>The United States said on Wednesday it will not support naming Hiroshima as a world heritage site.</p>
<p>The World Heritage Committee is meeting now in Merida, Mexico, and Japan has proposed that the atomic bomb dome in Hiroshima -- marking a building destroyed when the United States droppped the first atomic bomb in August 1945 -- be designated as a world heritage site.</p>
<p>But State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said: &quot;The United States will not support the inclusion of Hiroshima as a site on this list -- essentially because we have made the decision that we don't believe that war-related sites are within the scope of the convention.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;War-related sites by their nature are inherently controversial, and we believe that it's probably best not to include them on the list of sites that the World Heritage Committee takes up,&quot; he told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;So we will respectfully decline to support the Japanese effort to have Hiroshima included in this site,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Burns acknowledged that Auschwitz, a Nazi death camp from the Second World War, was included on the site list some years ago and that that decision is unlikely to be reversed.</p>
<p>But he said: &quot;The United States has made the decision that we don't believe ... it is helpful to this committee to include any war-related sites on its list.&quot;</p>
