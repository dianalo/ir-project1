<p>International spin bowlers Nicky Boje and Daniel Vettori, in a foretaste of possible test battles to come, are among the star performers on show in a one-day cricket match at Hoy Park on Thursday.</p>
<p>Boje will captain a South African academy side, which also includes Kenyan World Cup all-rounder Thomas Odoyo and emerging Eastern Province fast bowler Mornantau Hayward, while Vettori is a key member of the touring New Zealand academy squad.</p>
<p>Vettori, like Boje a slow left-arm bowler, has already represented his country at both test and one-day level and his New Zealand teammates include fellow one-day international caps in Andrew Penn, Craig McMillan and Shayne O'Connor.</p>
<p>The Hoy Park limited-overs contest is the first fixture of a three-week, six-match tour of South Africa by the 14 New Zealand academy cricketers.</p>
<p>The academy squad, coached by former Australian wicketkeeper Steve Rixon and managed by former Kiwi test player Dayle Hadlee, features several other players on the fringe of possible international honours.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a number of guys - like captain Llorne Powell, Stephen Lynch and Matthew Bell - who are all very, very fine players,&quot; Rixon told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This academy tour is a good opportunity for me to get a look at them and see who really are the mentally tough ones, who are the ones who want to work hard and the ones who want to take the short cuts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I get my opinion on that, at least I can express that when it comes to the New Zealand selectors coming to me and asking me for my thoughts on the next man in line.&quot;</p>
<p>Rixon, who has been the New Zealand national coach for a year, believes academy tours are vital in introducing emerging talent to the intensity of both test and one-day cricket.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get the system right and if I get involved with the boys at a younger age and work with them, they start to get a feel for the barrier being broken down. And when it does actually come down and they get the opportunity to play - either a test o at one-day cricket - they know exactly what's expected.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've been pushing hard for both the A-tour concept and the academy boys to do as much touring as possible because it certainly helps when it comes to the time for a decision to be made.&quot;</p>
<p>South African academy side (from): Nicky Boje (captain), Mark Bruyns, James Henderson, Morne Strydom, Douglas Gain, Grant Morgan, Jonathan Cook, Thomas Odoyo, Andrew Hall, Pierre Joubert, Ryan Maron, Mornantau Hayward, Anthony Botha, Robbie McQueen.</p>
<p>New Zealand academy side (from): Matthew Bell, Chris Brown, Martyn Croy, Llorne Howell (captain), Stephen Lynch, Craig McMillan, Nathan Morland, Shayne O'Connor, Michael Parlane, Andrew Penn, David Sewell, Matthew Sinclair, Daniel Vettori, Paul Wisema.</p>
