<p>The National Bank of Poland may need to raise interest rates next year to curb swelling domestic demand, the bank's deputy president told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Witold Kozinski said internal demand, signalled by the 27 percent growth of investment in the first three quarters of this year against the same period last year, was so big that it was also curbing the growth of exports.</p>
<p>&quot;Our problem is not how to proceed on the path of interest rate reduction, but how to control this huge demand,&quot; Kozinski said.</p>
<p>&quot;One will have to wait a long time for an interest rate cut, (and) maybe, maybe, we will be forced to raise interest rates...the demand is so high,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand is so big that it also diminishes a part of exports,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether Kozinski was refering to real, nominal or market interest rates.</p>
<p>The nominal rates -- the lombard and discount rates -- are now at 25 percent and 22 percent while market rates are at about 19.5 percent.</p>
<p>Last month the NBP said it would strive to raise real interest rates by keeping nominal rates flat amid falling inflation to curb domestic demand which the bank fears will blow Poland's trade gap out of proportion and boost inflation.</p>
<p>In October the central bank made clear it did not intend to raise its nominal interest rates in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Apart from investment, the fast rising domestic demand is signalled by the fast growth of credit for households which jumped almost 81 percent since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Poland's current account gap is expected to baloon to about $3.9 billion next year from a deficit of about $300 million this year to a large extent under the pressure of domestic demand.</p>
