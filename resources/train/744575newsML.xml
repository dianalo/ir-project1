<headline>Australia stocks fall 1.15 pct on Wall Street dip.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian stock market ended 1.15 percent lower on Monday and near the day's lows in response to Wall Street's 1.6 percent dip on Friday.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index shed 30.8 points to close at 2,653.4. Total turnover was worth a modest A$564 million (US$417.36 million), about two thirds of the normal amount.</p>
<p>Dealers said many players were cautious ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony on monetary policy and economic conditions before Congress on Tuedsay.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow could be down again tonight so nobody wanted to take any major positions today. Everybody will sit on the backburner for a day or two to see what Greenspan says,&quot; said Peter Struk of broker Reynolds &amp; Co in Sydney.</p>
<p>Others said domestic second quarter inflation and wages data, due Wednesday and Thursday respectively, were more important and could give an indication of whether the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates again soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Personally, I don't think anything will happen until the beginning of August,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The gold sector failed to hold on to early gains, and ended 0.1 percent lower after rising 1.3 percent on Friday following higher bullion prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still a general bearish sentiment in the market on gold. What we've seen to day is a symptom of that -- strong in the morning, then profit-takers came in,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Normandy Mining ended one cent up at A$1.58 after reaching A$1.62 earlier in the day. The smaller Delta Gold rose 10 cents or six percent to A$1.76 and was one of Monday's best performing stocks.</p>
<p>Great Central Mines fell six cents to A$2.63 in relatively active trade after rising last week on rumours of an imminent takeover by Canada's Barrick Gold Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the speculative traders that bought on Friday sold out because there was no announcement,&quot; one Sydney-based dealer said.</p>
<p>All the big miners lost ground. Bellwether BHP dropped 46 cents to A$18.10, while WMC lost 17 cents to A$7.70 and Rio Tinto 38 cents to A$21.42.</p>
<p>The banks held up better, the sector index falling a modest 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>ANZ ended nine cents down at A$10.06, while Westpac Banking climbed eight cents to A$7.98. Westpac has gained ground over the past week on expectations that its A$9.75 a share bid for the Bank of Melbourne will be approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Bank of Melbourne ended eight cents up at A$9.55.</p>
<p>Beverages company Coca-Cola Amatil was among the weakest with a 67 cent dip to A$15.91, a fall that sent the food and household sector index 2.8 percent lower.</p>
<p>&quot;There was bound to be some profit-taking today. The stock rose over A$1.50 on Friday,&quot; one dealer said about the bottler.</p>
<p>Troubled food group Burns Philp &amp; Co closed 10 cents up at A$2.54, its highest level in about a year, after it reached a legal settlement with Meridian Investment Trust, which rose eight cents to A$1.55.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Burns Philp will pay around A$115 million to Meridian to end a dispute following the 1990 collapse of the Estate Mortgage Trusts, which wiped out retirement savings of about 56,000 elderly investors.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.74)</p>
