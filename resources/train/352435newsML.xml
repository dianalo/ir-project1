<p>PARIS, Feb 3 - French Prime Minister Alain Juppe painted an upbeat picture of the economy on Monday, ruled out a cabinet reshuffle and called for unity to defeat the extreme-right National Front.</p>
<p>He also reaffirmed the governent's determination to stamp out violence in Corsica after separatist guerrillas set off 61 bombs on the Mediterranean island on Sunday in a show of strength.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we can say that, at the start of 1997, the outlook is better. You spoke about the dollar (strength) this morning and it's good for our exports,&quot; Juppe told France Inter radio in an interview. &quot;We are on the improvement track.&quot;</p>
<p>Citing a small decline in unemployment and signs of economic growth gathering pace, Juppe said that neither he nor President Jacques Chirac saw the need for a government reshuffle or a change in policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not going to change policy at a time when our policy seems to be producing good results, where December unemployment figures went in the right direction, where company bosses are rediscovering their morale, at a time when we're expecting an acceleration in growth,&quot; Juppe said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not see, neither does the president, any need for a ministerial reshuffle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said it was too early to talk of speeding up tax cuts. Ensuring France qualified for a single European currency would take priority over further tax cuts this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, in the month of January, compromising the good results obtained so far to qualify France for the euro would be unhelpful,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Juppe urged his centre-right coalition to pull out of a municipal election in Vitrolles, near Marseille, and unite with the opposition Socialists to try to prevent the National Front winning control of a fourth town in southern France.</p>
<p>The extreme-right candidate won 46.7 percent in Sunday's first round on a high 76.7 percent turnout, and is hot favourite to win the runoff next weekend.</p>
<p>On Corsica, Juppe vowed to pursue his government's crackdown on separatist guerrillas although he admitted it would take time and there would be more bombings on the island.</p>
<p>&quot;We are fully determined. We enjoy the backing of the immense majority of our fellow-citizens in Corsica,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Juppe came out against a call by ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing for militant Islamists to be included in planned parliamentary elections in Algeria.</p>
<p>The prime minister said the elections should be open to all legal democratic parties, effectively excluding the movement which won the biggest share of the vote in 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which was outlawed in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;The only party we support in Algeria is the party of democracy...Legal political groups must take part in this election,&quot; Juppe said.</p>
<p>Asked whether the FIS was among democratic parties, he said: &quot;As long as you use bombs, car bombs and knives you are not a party backing democratic values.&quot;</p>
