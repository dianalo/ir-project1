<p>Germany's stubbornly high unemployment cannot be blamed on increased wage levels or lower company profits, the DGB trade union federation said on Saturday.</p>
<p>In a report focusing on profit and wage developments, the DGB said company earnings for two years had been as high as levels reached during times of full employment.</p>
<p>At the same time, wage levels relative to national income were at their lowest post-war point, while unit wage costs had remained unchanged for the last year.</p>
<p>German unemployment is currently running at 11.1 percent, or 4.26 million people.</p>
<p>&quot;Employees have made great concessions. Now it is the turn of the employers to create training places and jobs,&quot; DGB board member Michael Geuenich said.</p>
<p>He said the government and the Bundesbank should also make efforts to contribute to pan-European employment policy.</p>
<p>The union federation said net wages, adjusted for inflation, had risen by just 0.1 percent in west Germany in 1996, and by 0.2 percent in east Germany.</p>
<p>West German wage levels last year were only 1.2 percent above 1980 levels, while corporate net profits had doubled over that period, it said.</p>
