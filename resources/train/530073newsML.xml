<p>SIMEX Brent crude was quiet in early trading on Tuesday as most players were attending the relaunch of the revised fuel oil futures contract this afternoon, brokers said.</p>
<p>June was quoted at $18.30/$18.40 per barrel, straddling London's closing of $18.34. July was indicated at $18.35/$18.57, also within range of London's $18.43-close.</p>
<p>The market remained jittery over Iraqi helicopters breaking a 'no-fly' zone imposed by the U.S. and other Western powers to pick Moslem pilgrims from the Saudi border.  </p>
<p>The White House urged Iraq to reconsider its decision and said it would &quot;respond appropriately&quot;. Brokers said this could threaten the country's oil-for-food accord with the United Nations.</p>
<p>But NYMEX crude shaved off two cents on the after-hours ACCESS system from its official close to last trade at $20.36, as players rolled over their positions ahead of May's expiry on Tuesday. June gained one cent to last trade at $20.08.</p>
