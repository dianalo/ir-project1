<p>The popular ousted leader of one of Indonesia's two minority parties on Thursday urged its members and supporters not to take part in the general election campaign that begins on Sunday.</p>
<p>But Megawati Sukarnoputri, ousted as head of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) by a government-backed rival last year, avoided calling for an illegal boycott of the May 29 polls.</p>
<p>The political temperature has risen ahead of the campaign with violent clashes continuing in Central Java province between supporters of the Moslem-orientated United Development Party (PPP) and the ruling Golkar.</p>
<p>Megawati said in her statement that she and her supporters had tried to take part in the formal election process but had been blocked by the state-run General Election Institute (LPU), which oversees the elections.</p>
<p>The LPU rejected her list of election candidates for the 500-seat House of Assembly and said it only recognised those of her rival, new PDI leader Surjadi.</p>
<p>&quot;As such, I say to all party members and PDI supporters throughout Indonesia that we will not take part in any campaign activities in the name of the PDI during the 1997 election campaign,&quot; Megawati said her statement.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we must continue to struggle together to create a general election which is democratic and constitutional according to the 1993 Broad Outlines of State Policy in the spirit of the 1945 constitution, especially during this campaign,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This policy is created for the sake of maintaining national unity and keeping an image of the election which is based on the people's sovereignty and Pancasila democracy,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Only the ruling Golkar, the PDI and the PPP are legally permitted to contest the election.</p>
<p>Megawati said she had decided to ask her supporters not to take part in the campaign in part to avoid violence.</p>
<p>Security forces have pledged to safeguard the election and prevent any unhealthy rivalry that would lead to violence.</p>
<p>But a private Jakarta radio station said on Thursday that unknown assailants had attacked the home of the head of the election body in Pekalongan, Central Java, the previous day. There have been several clashes in the district in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Last July, the worst riots in Jakarta in more than 20 years broke out when hundreds of supporters of Surjadi, backed by police and troops, attacked PDI headquarters to evict Megawati supporters that were occupying the building.</p>
<p>At least five people died in the riots, several buildings were burnt and dozens of vehicles destroyed.</p>
<p>The government has since banned street marches and rallies and has organised a system of campaign zones in an effort to prevent violence.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a political manifesto authored by Megawati was leaked to the media in which she said the country was in decline because of a lack of democracy, widespread corruption and a flawed legal system.</p>
