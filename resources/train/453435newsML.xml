<p>The world insurance business fears that erratic weather induced by global warming could deal it a crippling financial blow any time soon, industry executives say.</p>
<p>&quot;Disaster losses will continue to rise drastically in dimension and frequency,&quot; said Dr. Gerhard Berz, head of Geoscience Research at the company Munich Reinsurance.</p>
<p>&quot;Computer simulations indicate that already a $50 billion insured loss is possible in the United States from a single hurricane. This would probably be critical for the insurance industry in that country,&quot; said Dr. Andrew Dlugolecki, Group Assistant General Manager of Britain's General Accident.</p>
<p>The experts were speaking at a conference entitled &quot;The Impact of Climate Change on Business and Industry,&quot; held recently in Brussels.</p>
<p>Dlugolecki said the insurance business is still reeling from a series of massive financial shocks from natural disasters, and it is getting more difficult to dodge the conclusion that this is because human activity is having a malign impact on traditional weather patterns.</p>
<p>Scientists argue over the cause of a warming of the earth's climate. Some say this is simply in line with natural fluctuations through the ages. But others, notably those employed by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, say that human influence is now clear, and governments must unite to stop it.</p>
<p>The IPCC has been seeking agreement to force down the emission of so-called greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), said to contribute to a warming of the planet.</p>
<p>IPCC scientists say the increased temperature would cause havoc with the climate. Melting polar ice would raise sea levels and submerge low lying areas. Traditional agriculture would be decimated by untenable temperatures and severe storm frequency.</p>
<p>Dlugolecki points to a series of monster storms over the last 10 years, including an unprecedented hurricane in south east England and north west France in 1987 which cost insurers $2.5 billion, Hurricane Andrew in Florida which cost $16.5 billion in 1992, and Hurricane Opal in 1995 in the southern United States which cost $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>There are factors other than the possibility of global warming behind this tale of losses.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a moot point whether the trends in storm costs do indeed reveal a change in weather patterns. Most meteorologists are reluctant to conclude that there has been a significant change in weather patterns because of the natural variability inherent in the climate system and the sparseness of good meteorological records,&quot; Dlugolecki said.</p>
<p>Munich RE's Berz also points out other factors behind the industry's rising cost of claims.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend is primarily attributable to the continuing steady growth of the world's population and the increasing concentration of people and economic values in urban areas,&quot; Berz concedes.</p>
<p>The problem is being compounded by global migration of populations and industries into areas such as coastal regions, which are particularly exposed to natural hazards, Berz said.</p>
<p>But Berz said the overwhelming danger to the industry's future is climate change.</p>
<p>&quot;It is to be feared that climate change will produce in nearly all regions of the world new extreme values of many insurance-relevant parameters that will lead to natural disasters of unprecedented severity and frequency,&quot; according to Berz.</p>
<p>Although conceding that some environmentalists over-exploited the dangers from global warming in the early 1990s, GA's Dlugolecki said the industry is under threat.</p>
<p>&quot;Weather patterns are changing, and even small differences can have big effects. Climate change will lead to major consequences for insurers,&quot; Dlugolecki said.</p>
