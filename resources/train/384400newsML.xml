<p>Romania's tough economic stabilisation programme could be successful provided loans worth $1.0 billion from international lenders are put to good use and the government matches words with deeds, analysts said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea unveiled on Monday a package of radical reforms, promising only &quot;work, sweat and austerity&quot; to put Romanian economy on a market footing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very good sign and (the reform package) it's much tougher than we believed,&quot; Andrew Kenningham, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch, said from London.</p>
<p>The government pledged to bring bulging deficits and inflation under control and to bring back economic growth next year after a forecasted 2.0 percent fall in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;This (programme) is a sacrifice requested from people who already own very little. But it's not possible to drag Romania's economy out of its present situation without it,&quot; local independent analyst Ilie Serbanescu said.</p>
<p>Romania is struggling with a surging inflation, which hit an year-on-year 56.9 percent in 1996, when its budget deficit widened to 5.7 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Inflation is forecast to soar to 97.0 percent this year, led by liberalisation of fuel, electricity and food prices.</p>
<p>The government's plan, drafted with International Monetary Fund and World Bank experts, includes liberalisation of the foreign exchange market, faster privatisation and restructuring.</p>
<p>Analysts said fast action to implement reforms and proper channelling of loans were vital to make the package successful.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to judge by actions not by words. However, the programme looks very good,&quot; Merrill's Kenningham said.</p>
<p>&quot;This programme is feasible only if the funds drawn from international lenders are properly used,&quot; a local banker said.</p>
<p>The IMF and World Bank withheld loans in 1996 on grounds that the former ruling leftists had stalled reforms.</p>
<p>IMF mission chief Poul Thomsen hailed Ciorbea's programme as &quot;tough and ambitious&quot; and said he was confident the new government would go on with reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Our experience with Romania in the past is that again and again stabilisation plans have broken down,&quot; Thomsen said in reference to previous Fund accords which failed during the former leftist government ousted in elections last November.</p>
<p>Reforms of the farming and energy-intensive sectors were crucial to stabilise the economy and secure loans, he said.</p>
<p>The government also promised social protection steps to cushion the impact of the painful reforms, expected to push unemployment rate to 8.0 percent, up from a current 6.7.</p>
<p>&quot;The main problem is whether Romanians accept or not such a sacrifice,&quot; said Serbanescu.</p>
