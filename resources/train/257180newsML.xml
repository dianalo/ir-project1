<p>Two people were killed and three injured when police opened fire on Saturday to control a rioting mob in a southern Indian town, police said.</p>
<p>Six policemen were injured, one of them seriously, when they tried to control a mob that started throwing stones at shops and property in Mulbagal, 100 km (62 miles) from Bangalore, after hearing a rumour that a mosque was desacrated, police said.</p>
<p>Police first used batons to disperse the crowd in the town, which has a large Moslem population, and later detained 25 people when the mob regrouped and violence continued, said A.P.Durai, police chief of the state of Karnataka.</p>
<p>Protestors rioted to demand the release of the detained, which led to the police firing, Durai told Reuters in Bangalore, state capital of Karnataka.</p>
<p>Police imposed a curfew, Durai said. There was no confirmation of any act of desacration, police said.</p>
