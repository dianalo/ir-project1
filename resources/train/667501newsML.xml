<p>Bonds recovered from their lows after the market concluded that higher than expected price rises in May would not break the downward trend in inflation.</p>
<p>Traders said that there was even room for the 10-year spread with the cash Bund to narrow slightly on Wednesday, aided by the renewed optimism over monetary union.</p>
<p>Analysts do not expect the Bank of Portugal to cut official interest rates on Wednesday for the start of a new commercial bank reserve period and therefore there is unlikely to be any steepening of the yield curve.  </p>
<p>&quot;After the selling on the inflation, the market recovered on the notion the rise was one-off and the downtrend remains in tact,&quot; said one trader. Year-on-year inflation was 2.1 percent against forecasts for between 1.4 and April's 1.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation was bad due to potatoes and pork meat but the other sectors evolved well,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>&quot;Convergence for the single currency will give a boost to the peripheries tomorrow and the spread could go towards 60 basis points,&quot; he added. The two year bond closed with a yield of 5.23 percent, up from 5.15 percent before news of the inflation figure and 5.21 percent at Monday's close.</p>
