<p>An Argentine rebel fighting in the ranks of one of Colombia's guerrilla groups was killed in clashes with the army in southwest Colombia on Monday, authorities said.</p>
<p>Gustavo Abel Cabezas, a member of the Cuban-inspired National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second largest rebel force, died in a battle near the town of Jamundi.</p>
<p>Regional army commander Gen. Luis Eduardo Charry said an Argentine passport and identity card were found on Cabezas' body. According to stamps in the passport, Cabezas, born in Buenos Aires, entered Colombia on Aug. 8 via Bolivia.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no idea what an Argentine was doing fighting with the ELN. Maybe he had got the Che syndrome,&quot; Charry told reporters, referring to the legendary Argentine-born guerrilla leader Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara.</p>
<p>Guevara played a key role in the Cuban revolution alongside Fidel Castro and later fought in Africa and Bolivia, where he was killed in 1967 as he tried to export revolution to the South American mainland.</p>
<p>Little has been officially revealed about the possible presence of foreigners among the ranks of Colombia's estimated 18,000 rebels. Another Argentine was recently arrested in the southwest city of Cali in possession of ELN documents but later released without being charged.</p>
<p>Army intelligence experts have in the past speculated that Colombian guerrilla forces may have links with the Basque separatist force ETA and even Japan's Red Army.</p>
