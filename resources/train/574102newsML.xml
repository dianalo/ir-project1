<p>A white former South African cabinet minister who bulldozed black homes in the name of apartheid was one of hundreds of people making a last-minute rush on Saturday to apply for forgiveness, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Piet Koornhof, responsible for demolishing black-owned shacks built in areas reserved for whites while a minister between 1978 and 1984, said he was deeply sorry for his role.</p>
<p>&quot;I have applied for amnesty because I was part of the apartheid system which caused a lot of damage and human rights abuses,&quot; Koornhof said outside the Cape Town offices of the truth commission.</p>
<p>&quot;Applying for amnesty is a gesture which black people appreciate. It is a sign of feeling intensely sorry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Koornhof, who enforced laws forbidding sex between people of different races, was one of the first National Party ministers to embrace post-apartheid changes, leaving his wife of over 40 years to father a child with a mixed-race lover.</p>
<p>Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu's commission wants confessions from people who might have blood on their hands from the fight over apartheid.</p>
<p>The offer of pardon in exchange for coming clean expires at midnight (2200 GMT) on Saturday.</p>
<p>Former security police, soldiers and senior members of Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) were among those taking their last chance to come clean, commission officials said.</p>
<p>But there was no sign of Koornhof's former boss, then prime minister P.W. Botha, who insists he committed no crimes and has no need for pardons.</p>
<p>There had been applications from senior apartheid army officers and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, whose supporters have been reluctant to come forward.</p>
<p>Figures showed around 7,000 people have sought amnesty -- nearly a fifth of them in the last week. Tutu has made a public effort to ensure all parties are heard and treated fairly.</p>
<p>State radio reported that far right-wing leader Eugene Terre Blanche had advised some of his followers to apply for amnesty if they had crimes to confess.</p>
<p>He said he did not know of anything for which he needed forgiveness, but would testify at commission hearings for any followers who might want this.</p>
<p>ANC Defence Minister Joe Modise has said he would apply but his predecessor, General Magnus Malan, who led the last decade of the white government's fight against black liberation groups said he did not need any pardon.</p>
<p>The commission, which has the power to grant amnesty to those who make full confessions, warned Malan he might be making a mistake.</p>
<p>Botha's successor, F.W. de Klerk, also says he committed no crime, but most of the ANC leadership, with the likely exception of Mandela, were expected to apply.</p>
<p>The deadline for amnesty applications was originally last December, but Mandela extended it by five months at Tutu's request because relatively few people had come forward.</p>
<p>Dozens of former security police have since applied, including those responsible for the death of black activist Steve Biko in 1977.</p>
<p>But many have rejected the probe as a witch hunt, saying apartheid-era crimes should be forgotten. They said revelations to the commission hinder the reconciliation the body is intended to promote.</p>
