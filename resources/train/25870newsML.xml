<p>Greece said on Saturday stormy relations with Albania were over and pledged to push its European Union partners to provide more aid to improve infrastructure in the impoverished state.</p>
<p>Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, the first senior EU minister to visit Albania since a disputed general election in May, said Greece aimed to strengthen ties with Albania and help in major projects to build and repair roads.</p>
<p>&quot;The period of misunderstandings...is over,&quot; Pangalos told reporters in the southern town of Gjirokaster, near the Albanian-Greek border.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very happy with our relations and would like to put them on a new level, towards more constructive ties,&quot; he said at Gjirokaster town hall before opening a new Greek consulate.</p>
<p>Tension between the two countries rose to fever pitch in 1994 when Athens deported thousands of Albanian immigrants following Tirana's deportation of a senior Greek cleric.</p>
<p>Albania accused the churchman of inciting unrest among its large ethnic Greek minority in the south. Greece charged that Tirana was persecuting the ethnic Greeks.</p>
<p>Washington and the EU urged both countries to exercise restraint. The Bosnian war was at its height and the West feared further conflict in the Balkans would ignite fighting across the region.</p>
<p>Pangalos held 45 minutes of talks with Albanian Foreign Minister Tritan Shehu, focusing on bilateral ties, more visas for Albanians and road building, Albanian government spokesman Gilbert Galanxhi told reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>Albania and Greece signed a landmark friendship treaty last March. Athens agreed to legalise the status of Albanian immigrants working in Greece, estimated at around 350,000. In exchange, Tirana vowed to set up three Greek schools in the south, settling one of the main grievances of the minority.</p>
<p>Road construction is an important economic and social issue in Albania, where cars were a rarity during 45 years of communist rule, brought to an end by popular protest in 1990.</p>
<p>Driving 200 km (160 miles) can take four hours on narrow, pit-holed roads, clogged with second-hand cars bought by Albanian workers abroad, and carts drawn by horses or oxen.</p>
<p>Albania plans to upgrade roads from Gjirokaster to Fier, 120 km (80 miles) northwest of the town, and from Fier to the port town of Vlora on the southern coast.</p>
<p>A road from Gjirokaster to the Greek border, linking it to a route leading to the Greek town of Ioannina, was also discussed by the ministers, Galanxhi said.</p>
<p>He said Athens pledged to give its own assistance and encourage the EU to step up cooperation projects like PHARE, the EU's technical aid programme for East European countries.</p>
<p>Relations between Tirana and the EU have cooled since President Sali Berisha's ruling Democrats won almost all parliamentary seats in an election criticised by foreign observers as failing to meet international standards.</p>
<p>Washington, the EU and the Council of Europe have said they would closely watch nationwide local elections in Albania on October 20 to gauge the Democrats' commitment to democracy.</p>
<p>Lord Finsberg, who headed a Council of Europe delegation to Tirana this week, said the body could not rule out suspending Albania if the government failed to open serious dialogue with the opposition boycotting parliament, including the Socialists.</p>
