<headline>Northeast Utilities CEO to retire.</headline>
<dateline>BERLIN, Conn. 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Northeast Utilities on Thursday said Bernard M. Fox planned to retire as chiarman, president and chief executive officer in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>The company said its board was commencing a search for a successor.</p>
<p>No specific date for Fox's retirement was set, though it is likely to be between late July, when he turns 55 and becomes eligible to retire, and the end of the year, Northeast Utilities said. It said Fox agreed to remain in his position until a successor has been named.</p>
<p>After his retirement, Fox will serve as an adviser to the company for two years.</p>
<p>The utility, which serves parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, said Fox asked the board at its January meeting to accept his request to retire at some point in 1997. The trustees tabled his request at that time but accepted it at a special meeting this week, NU said.</p>
<p>The board is expected to form a search committee at its February 25 meeting. It does not expect to complete its search until the second half of this year, the company said.</p>
