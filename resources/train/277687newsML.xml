<p>President Boris Yeltsin on Friday met visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng, the Kremlin leader's first foreign visitor since he returned to work after heart surgery, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>It quoted Yeltsin as saying he was happy with the pace of bilateral relations highlighted by his visit to China in April.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategic agreements reached in Beijing work,&quot; Interfax quoted Yeltsin as saying.</p>
<p>Russian officials have said Li's trip is aimed mainly at paving the way for a planned visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 1997.</p>
<p>Beijing's official Xinhua news agency said on Friday that China, Russia and three other former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have reached a comprehensive accord on reducing forces along their borders.</p>
<p>Xinhua said the agreement was reached in Beijing but gave no details about the timing or extent of troop reductions and did not say when a formal pact would be signed.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin was also due to meet Li on Friday and was expected to arrange to hold regular talks with the Chinese premier, setting up the level of relations that Moscow now has with only the United States and France.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery in November and returned to work on Monday, has said more than once that he seeks a strategic partnership between Russia and China.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin has ruled a revival of the close political and military alliance that had existed between Moscow and Beijing in 1950s and degenerated in the mid-1960s into two decades of bitter rivalry for leadership in the communist world.</p>
<p>Russia's desire to develop close links with China has followed NATO's plans to expand eastwards by admitting Moscow's Cold War allies in Eastern Europe as members of the alliance.</p>
<p>Russia also views China as a key trading partner and both countries have shown interest in upgrading economic ties which have failed to keep pace with an improvement in political links.</p>
<p>China and Russia are working on a plan to increase cross-border trade by setting up a special zone in the northeastern Chinese city of Suifenhe that would allow free movement for traders.</p>
<p>The two nations are also negotiating over major deals from nuclear power plants to a natural gas pipeline, but political analysts said Li's visit was unlikely to yield a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Russia has proposed building a pipeline to carry Siberian natural gas to China and is seeking a role in China's huge Three Gorges dam project. It is also keen to sell military and civil aircraft to China.</p>
<p>First Deupty Prime Minister Alexei Bolshakov, quoted by Interfax news agency, said Russia and China planned to sign several documents during Li's visit concerning planned sales of Russia's Su-27 fighters. He gave no details.</p>
