<title>USA: Federal appeals court bans gaming on tribal lands.</title>
<headline>Federal appeals court bans gaming on tribal lands.</headline>
<dateline>DENVER 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>A federal appeals court Friday ruled that high-stakes, casino-style gambling operated by Indian tribes in New Mexico is illegal.</p>
<p>In a 3-0 decision, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling which concluded that Gov. Gary Johnson lacked authority to sign compacts with the tribes which allowed the gambling.</p>
<p>However, the court postponed Friday's decision which would have shut down the casinos pending further appeal by the tribes.  It noted that the tribes have spent millions of dollars to build the gaming facilities and that &quot;gaming revenues are a major source of income for the tribes.&quot;</p>
<p>In an unusual commentary, the judges said that despite the ruling &quot;we have by no means solved an extremely difficult and sensitive problem facing tribe members, citizens and legislators in New Mexico. The only hope for a satisfactory solution is through dialogue and good faith negotiation between all involved parties.&quot;</p>
<p>The governor lacked authority to sign the compacts, the court said. Under federal law gaming can only be allowed on tribal lands if it is already sanctioned on non-tribal lands. To date the New Mexico legislature has not approved gaming in the state.</p>
<p>The lower court judge had granted the tribes' request for a stay, thus permitting the casinos and other gaming casinos to remain open pending this appeal.</p>
<p>The types of gambling involved slot machines, casino games, dog racing and lotteries.</p>
<p>The court noted that former Gov. Bruce King refused to negotiate with the tribes and that gambling on tribal lands became a significant campaign issue in the 1994 election, in which Johnson defeated King. Johnson had publicly committed to signing the compacts with the tribes if elected.</p>
