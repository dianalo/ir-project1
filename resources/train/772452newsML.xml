<headline>Indonesia late rubber firm on deals, Tokyo gains.</headline>

<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 rubber offer  prices were firm in late trading, with sentiment bolstered by purchases  and gains in Tokyo, traders said.</p>
<p>They said October shipment SIR20 was done at 44.00 cents/lb fob Palembang,  while November rubber was done at 44.125 cents fob Medan. The buyers  were Singapore-based dealers.</p>
<p>&quot;Some deals were done in Palembang and Medan, although the overall  market was quiet,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The gains in Tokyo today, I think,  helped pull in the buyers.&quot;</p>
<p>Tokyo futures ended higher across the board on Friday, helped by the  Japanese currency's weakness against the dollar and higher prices  for other commodities in the country.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected Indonesian prices to be steady next week  on improved demand, but added that they only expected values to improve  significantly after the summer holidays.</p>
<p>Traders said September SIR20 offers were quoted at 44.00 cents/lb  fob Medan, and at 44.25 cents for October, 43.75-43.875 cents fob  Palembang and Surabaya, 43.50 cents fob Padang and 43.25 cents fob  Pontianak and Jambi.</p>
