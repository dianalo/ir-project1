<p>Investors should buy shares of Polish household appliance maker Amica Wronki SA, which should benefit from increased demand from Poland's population of 38 million, Flemings Research said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;The ability of Poles to buy consumer goods is rising....Over the past three years there has been a credit boom,&quot; the report dated July 8 said, adding that any monetary tightening by the central bank should slow but not halt demand.</p>
<p>Amica Wronki, whose initial public offering at 50 zlotys per share was oversubscribed, has said it expects to start bourse trade in late August or early September.</p>
<p>Flemings said Amica, which was investing to produce quality products, broadening its range of kitchen ovens and expanding into other appliances such as refrigerators, had product quality at least as good as foreign imports.</p>
<p>It said Amica should raise net profit to 33 million zlotys this year and 44 million next year from 25.3 million in 1996.</p>
<p>It said sales should rise to 570 million zlotys this year and 723 million zlotys next year from 361.9 million in 1996.</p>
