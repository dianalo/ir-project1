<title>ISRAEL: Israeli troops detain Gaza fishermen.</title>

<p>Israeli forces arrested two Gaza Strip fishermen in Gaza on Sunday and briefly surrounded a fishing boat off the Gaza coast demanding they be allowed to search it, Palestinian police said.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said it was checking the report.</p>
<p>Palestinian police Captain Khalid Abu al-Ila told Reuters some 50 Israeli soldiers raided Fisherman's Square in Khan Younis in the strip and arrested two fishermen.</p>
<p>Ila said he had demanded Palestinian forces join the Israelis surrounding the fishing boat to defuse the situation but said the Israelis initially refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>A short while later the Israelis changed their minds, Ila said, and both forces dealt with the boat.</p>
<p>&quot;The Israelis agreed to our demand and we searched the boat in front of them and it was clear that there was nothing suspicious,&quot; Ila told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the Israelis then allowed the boat with its six Palestinian fishermen to proceed on its way. The two men arrested earlier were still in Israeli custody.</p>
<p>Ila said he still did not know why Israel arrested the two fisherman or had insisted on a search of the boat. He said tensions raised by the Israeli acts, which he called &quot;provocations&quot;, had eased when the boat was released.</p>
<p>Under the deal setting up Palestinian self-rule in much of the Gaza Strip, Israel retains ultimate control over borders and at sea. There are also areas on land, like Fisherman's Square, where Israel has ultimate security control.</p>
<p>Israel-Palestinian relations are in crisis over Israel's breaking ground for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. Israeli troops and Palestinian demonstrators have clashed for 11 consecutive days in the West Bank over the settlement.</p>
<p>In Gaza, where much more of the land is under full Palestinian control, there has been relative quiet.</p>
