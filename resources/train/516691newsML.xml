<p>White sugar futures ended mostly steady on Thursday. But price movements were narrow with the market drawing little incentive from a lacklustre New York market.</p>
<p>Some of the turnover came from against actuals trades but routine business was the order of the day with very little interest reported to trade arbitrages against the New York raws, traders said.</p>
<p>Volume amounted to 1,471 lots.</p>
<p>August ended unchanged at $307.00 after ranging between $306 and $307.30. October was up 40 cents at $303.20.</p>
<p>Technically, August has skidded along $306.00 support as an intraday low for two consecutive trading sessions, reluctant to push back above the upward trendline which had been underneath the market since late January.</p>
<p>In other news, Alfa Group, one of Russia's biggest importers of Cuban raw sugar, is said to be considering extending a credit of up to $50 million to Cuba to help finance the 1998 sugar cane harvest.</p>
<p>Alfa Group was reported to be planning to import 300,000 tonnes of Cuban raws up to June.</p>
