<title>UK: NWE gas oil rallies with IPE, German cargo demand.</title>
<headline>NWE gas oil rallies with IPE, German cargo demand.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gas oil rallied $2-4 a tonne on Monday as healthy German demand lifted spot market premiums, magnifying a rally on benchmark IPE futures, traders said.</p>
<p>A 20,000-tonne part cargo of German grade heating oil due to load July 3-5 was sold at July IPE +$2.60 a tonne, basis cif Hamburg, about $1 firmer than talk on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said steady interest from buyers in Europe's largest heating oil market, where cool temperatures have led to a modest increase in consumption, was combining with thin supply of Russian barrels to push premiums higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is there in the background, particularly into Germany, and there's not much Russian coming out at the moment,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Prompt IPE July gas oil futures rallied $1.50 to close at $165.25 a tonne, pushed higher by stronger crude markets which were benefiting from continuing uncertainty about when Iraqi exports would resume.</p>
<p>The IPE gains and a strong dollar kept barge markets thin, however, with deals restricted to a couple of European diesel parcels which fetched a steady July IPE +$5.50 a tonne fob Rotterdam.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of higher futures prices, a stronger dollar/mark and rising premiums in Rotterdam means nobody is interested today,&quot; said a barge trader.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were talked slightly firmer either side of July IPE +50 cents a tonne for prompt delivery with July 15-31 barrels offered at +$1.00.</p>
