<p>At least 38 people were killed in a blast in an explosives warehouse in India's western state of Maharashtra on Thursday, the United News of India (UNI) said.</p>
<p>The Press Trust of India (PTI) had earlier said the blast occurred in a construction warehouse near the town of Satara, killing 19 and injuring 23 people.</p>
<p>PTI quoted a district official in Satara as being unsure of the cause of the blast.</p>
<p>UNI said its reporter found rescue operations in progress at the building which had collapsed with the impact.</p>
<p>UNI, in a separate report on Thursday, quoted police in the state capital Bombay as saying they had arrested a man alleged to be planning to kill Bal Thackeray, leader of Maharashtra's rightwing Hindu Shiv Sena party, with a bomb.</p>
<p>It said the Moslem man, identified by police as Abdulla Salafi, was planning to target Shiv Sena's offices on Wednesday, the anniversary of a string of bomb blasts in Bombay on March 12, 1993.</p>
<p>Some 260 people were killed in the attacks that were linked to underworld Moslem gangs, apparently seeking revenge for the demolition of a 16th century mosque by Hindu militants in December 1992.</p>
