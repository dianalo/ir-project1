<p>Analysts say they are still waiting for the dust to clear after the Israeli government reformed the exchange rate mechanism and the Bank of Israel slashed interest rates two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Since the cabinet decision, which widened the Israeli currency's trading band and lowered its crawling slope, the Israeli shekel has lost some five percent against the dollar to 3.587 on Monday. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange's Mishtanim index of 100 leading has fallen 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the stock and currency markets have been reacting to the uncertainty, not to the fundamentals,&quot; said Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg, senior economist in the securities division of Israel's Bank Hapoalim.</p>
<p>Like most other analysts, she discounts the long-term significance of the changes.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the shekel rate will stabilise in the short run,&quot; said Vikas Nath, emerging markets strategist at UBS in London. &quot;We are shooting for 3.47 or 3.48 once the short cover gives way.&quot;</p>
<p>By year end, he sees the dollar at 3.55-3.6 shekels, not far off from the 3.5 shekels he forecast before the eruption.</p>
<p>The shekel's current slide marks a reversal for the currency, which had been riding high on the back of big capital inflows into the country. Some of the inflow was due to stepped-up foreign investment, but most was due to Israelis' taking advantage of lower overseas interest rates.</p>
<p>That is why Baudot-Trajtenberg says the shekel's weakening is a short-term trend.</p>
<p>&quot;The people who've forced the depreciation are mostly the business sector here,&quot; she said. &quot;But you don't get a sense that they want to get out of their dollar loans.&quot;</p>
<p>She expects the shekel to experience periodic waves of speculation but settle near the lower end of its trading band against the basket of foreign currencies to which it is linked. As of Sunday, the shekel was 4.6 percent above the lower band.</p>
<p>But Hezy Gutman, chief economist at First International Bank of Israel, warns that each day the shekel falls further the odds of a significant rebound grow slimmer. Gutman said he is not confident that the shekel will appreciate enough to again reach the lower end of the band.</p>
<p>Gutman said he could still see the shekel falling far enough for the Bank of Israel to intervene in the forex market. &quot;There are situations where you have no choice,&quot; he said. &quot;If the depreciation reaches 10 percent, (the central bank) can create a balance with just a little intervention.&quot;</p>
<p>However, a top Bank of Israel official indicated on Sunday that the bank would be more inclined to raise interest rates than intervene.</p>
<p>The exchange rate has an outsized impact on the trade-oriented Israeli economy. A weaker shekel could give a boost to the country's sluggish exports but also feed into inflation by raising the price of imports and housing. Israeli home prices are customarily linked to the dollar.</p>
<p>But economists are cautious in assessing its impact.</p>
<p>Nath said even a moderate weakening of the shekel over then long run would improve export prospects. But Gutman said the continued uncertainty overhanging the exchange rate would moderate any export growth.</p>
<p>Israel's sluggish growth and rising unemployment would discourage importers and builders from passing along the higher prices created by the weaker shekel, economists say. As a result, inflation is unlikely to accelerate.</p>
<p>But Gutman said interest rates are unlikely to fall either, after the Bank of Israel lowered rates 1.2 percentage point to 12.7 percent two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;My forecast is that we won't see a further fall in the nominal interest rate,&quot; said Baudot-Trajtenberg. &quot;I think we might see a rise towards the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>She warned that the budget may come under pressure in the second half of the year at the same time that the Bank of Israel begins orienting monetary policy towards the government's 1998 inflation target. She said the target could be as low as six percent.</p>
