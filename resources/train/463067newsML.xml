<p>Serbia presented on Monday new draft privatisation law introducing heavy incentives for future investors but refrained from voucher privatisation and making the process compulsory for companies.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the project of a new ownership picture of Serbia and of its new history,&quot; said Mirko Vasiljevic, the head of a team of experts who prepared the draft.</p>
<p>Serbia's Minister of Economic and Ownership Transformation Milan Beko said the law envisaged three forms of selling state-controlled assets: sell-off with discounts, share issues and debt-for-equity swaps.</p>
<p>The book value of the Serbian companies expected to enter privatisation runs between 60 and 70 billion German marks. Independent estimates see the value between 30 and 100 billion German marks.</p>
<p>There will be three rounds of the ownership transformation with four million people taking part in the first round.</p>
<p>First round involves sale of shares to company employees and to employees employed elsewhere with a discount.</p>
<p>Second round includes sale of shares without discount and the third sale of unsold shares from the previous two rounds.</p>
<p>Such shares will be sold with a maximum 20 percent discount of the revalued price from the second round.</p>
<p>In case that an investor wants to buy 40 percent of the remaining unsold shares of a company, the law envisages a 30 percent discount of the revalued price.</p>
<p>A decision to go private will be autonomous in the case of most companies, but the state consent is needed in the case of big companies, infrastructure systems and indebted firms.</p>
<p>Employees and pensioners and will enjoy a 20 percent basic discount plus a further one percent discount for each year of service.</p>
<p>Each of those investors cannot buy more than an equivalent of 20,000 German marks worth of shares.</p>
<p>The law allows subscribed shares to be paid for in five years.</p>
<p>The ownership transformation in companies will be performed in three stages.</p>
<p>In the first, shares will be sold with a discount inside the firm. In the second stage, unsold shares will be offered on the local bourse but without discount. The third round is reserved for sale on the market with discount.</p>
<p>Share subscription period can be no shorter than 20 days and no longer than 40 days. Bids will be invited via public tenders. The law sees 120 days between the two rounds of sale. Discounts will be in force for one year.</p>
<p>Privatisation receipts will be directed to three state funds, with 50 percent going to the Serbian Development Fund, 25 percent to the Pension Fund and 25 percent to the Serbian Labour Market Office to finance creating new jobs.</p>
<p>After three rounds of sale finalised, all unsold shares will be acquired by a special fund, called Share Fund. The Fund will be established within three months after the enactment of the law.</p>
<p>&quot;The Share Fund will be a temporary institution and will last until all shares are sold,&quot; Vasiljevic said.</p>
<p>The moment the shares are acquired by the Share Fund, all equities will be available to international investors.</p>
<p>The fund takes over all unsold shares without any voting rights and sells them in three rounds. Privatisation proceeds also end up with three state funds.</p>
<p>Beko said privatisation in Serbia will offer a chance to investors to buy shares of loss-making companies and saw capital gains as a strong motive for able managers.</p>
<p>The law does not specify whether holders of old hard currency savings will be able to swap deposits for shares.</p>
<p>But the Serbian government will soon offer some of state commercial premises, state building sites and various concessions in exchange for hard currency deposits which could also be used in a debt-for-equity swaps.</p>
<p>Beko said the law will be presented on the Internet later today and public discussion home and abroad. -- Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
