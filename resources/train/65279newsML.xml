<p>A beaming Shannon Lucid on Thursday embraced the American crew of shuttle Atlantis, which docked at Russia's Mir hours earlier to make good on a promise to fetch her home.</p>
<p>The hatches between the shuttle and Mir swung open at 12:40 a.m. CDT (0540 GMT) as the two craft soared 248 miles (399 km) above the South Pacfic.</p>
<p>Atlantis skipper Bill Readdy was welcomed to the orbiting outpost with a handshake and hug from his Russian counterpart Valery Korzun.</p>
<p>But the warmest greeting came when when Lucid was reunited with John Blaha, who will replace her aboard Mir. The two U.S. astronauts, who have flown together in space twice before, floated in each other's arms, wearing wide grins.</p>
<p>Atlantis, with six astronauts and thousands of pounds (kilos) of supplies aboard, docked at Mir at 10:13 p.m. CDT on Wednesday (0313 GMT on Thursday).</p>
<p>&quot;Atlantis and Mir are shaking hands,&quot; said Readdy as the metallic petals of the two docking ports slipped together.</p>
<p>&quot;You make that look easy,&quot; radioed mission control's Bill McArthur.</p>
<p>Electric motors then drew the two ports together, completing the docking process and making an air-tight seal.</p>
<p>Readdy had to negotiate his way through the station's forest of delicate, electricity generating solar panels, including a newly installed concertina-like array that hangs just 14 feet (4.2 metres) from the shuttle's nose.</p>
<p>The shuttle's arrival at Mir, its fourth visit, ended a three-day chase through space that began early on Monday with a pre-dawn blastoff from Florida's Kennedy Space Centre.</p>
<p>Lucid has been waiting for her ride home since early August. The shuttle was running nearly seven weeks late because of rocket problems, a threatening hurricane and scheduling difficulties.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old mother of three was silent for most of the shuttle's approach, although her Russian crewmates, Valery Korzun and Alexander Kaleri, were heard chatting with Blaha by radio.</p>
<p>Lucid has been working aboard the Russian space outpost since March as part of a NASA effort to learn more about long duration space flights before starting construction of the planned international station.</p>
<p>When the hatches open, Blaha was to take Lucid's place on Mir, beginning a four-month tour of duty on Mir for the former Vietnam fighter pilot. He is the second of six U.S. astronauts who will staff the Russian station into 1998.</p>
<p>Atlantis will be berthed at Mir for five days while supplies and equipment are transferred to and from the station. The shuttle is carrying about 4,600 pounds (2,070 kgs) of supplies and equipment for Mir and will return to Earth with 2,200 pounds (990 kgs) of scientific samples and other gear from the station.</p>
<p>The shuttle is due back to earth on Sept. 26, ending Lucid's 188-day mission, a record for a woman and the longest by an American.</p>
