<headline>GOLF-WOOSNAM MAY UNDERGO SURGERY ON INJURED BACK.</headline>
<dateline>BERLIN 1996-10-03</dateline>

<p>Ian Woosnam, still challenging Colin Montgomerie for the European number one spot, is considering having surgery on his back.</p>
<p>The former U.S. Masters champion, playing in some pain, shot a three-under-par 69 in the German Masters on Thursday -- one shot better than Montgomerie.</p>
<p>Woosnam's 69 left him three shots behind five joint leaders, fellow Welshman Mark Mouland, Irishman Paul McGinley, France's Marc Farry, England's Peter Baker and Argentine Jose Coceres.</p>
<p>Woosnam, who has been plagued by back trouble in recent years, said after his round: &quot;It is still very sore and now the problem is spreading to my calf muscles...they are burning up and I can hardly walk 100 yards without feeling them.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't get through the ball and can only use my arms.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been told I really need surgery and I am seriously thinking about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Montgomerie, who looks certain to finish Europe's leading player for the fourth successive year, was also unhappy but not because of any fitness problems.</p>
<p>He was four under after 13 holes and poised to challenge for the lead when he had a double bogey six at the 16th.</p>
<p>&quot;It was one of those things,&quot; he said. &quot;I got a flyer out of the rough with my six iron and went over the back of the green, chipped back and three-putted from 20 feet.&quot;</p>
<p>Of the five leaders, McGinley will be the most unhappy as his only bogey of the round came at the final hole where he went over the back with his second shot and failed to get up and down.</p>
