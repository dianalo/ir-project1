<p>Talk of early elections in France and of tax hikes in Germany failed to unnerve the German bond market on Monday, in part because investors saw the moves as underscoring official commitment to EMU, analysts said.</p>
<p>With French President Jacques Chirac preparing to call a parliamentary election and Bonn appearing to prepare a mid-year tax increase, German Bunds could have amassed sharp losses.</p>
<p>Instead the June Bund futures contract  traded down about 15 basis points in the morning and was not expected to break much lower in the afternoon, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an element of uncertainty, but it is hard to see how it is bad for the markets,&quot; said Ros Lifton economist at HSBC Markets in London referring to French election plans.</p>
<p>Overall economists agree that as France and Germany, the two engines driving European monetary union, scramble to get their houses in order, the market can only welcome the steps.</p>
<p>&quot;Both developments signal a fairly strong commitment to the EMU timetable,&quot; Lifton added.</p>
<p>German bond dealers largely shrugged off talk Bonn's budget shortfall would be much bigger than Finance Minister Theo Waigel has said, threatening Germany's timely start into EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has priced in a relatively low amount of tax revenues, so what was much more interesting to the market this morning was the question whether Bonn would raise the mineral oil tax and how that would affect inflation &quot; said Klaus Holschuh, head of global bond research at Commerzbank.</p>
<p>As analysts said it would be critical for Waigel to act immediately after Germany's 1997 tax estimate is released in mid-May, many said it was highly probably that preparations for a 10 to 20 pfennig fuel tax were underway already.</p>
<p>While such a tax would raise Germany's current 1.5 percent inflation rate and risks upsetting the bond markets, analysts agreed there would be little long-term danger for inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;This will not put inflation on a new upward trajectory,&quot; HSBC's Lifton said.</p>
<p>Even Germany's bond issuance programme, where Bonn is about one third of the way through its annual plan, is not seen to upset the markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact we sense a bit of a shortage of new material, so more material would not upset the market,&quot; Holschuh said.</p>
<p>One danger however would be if Bonn made good on its commitment to review the option to issue longer-dated paper and actually issue a 30-year bond, analysts said, arguing this could signal a turn in the interest rate cycle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile France's preparations to call early elections also seemed to be welcomed by the bond market as they underscored the Chirac government's commitment to readying France for timely start into EMU, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If Chirac's party has a clear victory, the win will eliminate any credibility crisis and pave the way for Chirac to press through more austerity measures,&quot; said Frank Schroeder, analyst at Trinkaus Capital Management in Duesseldorf.</p>
<p>HSBC's Lifton added, that the market in France appeared to be set up to believe that if Chirac wins, as he is expected to do, then the decision to go ahead with EMU will not be threatened.</p>
<p>On the other hand, analysts also stressed there were still dangers involved in Germany's tax situation and France's election plans.</p>
<p>&quot;Especially Germany's homemade deficit problems could lead to questions about the political will to interpret the criteria strictly. If there is any fear about a softening of criteria, the market will not like it,&quot; Trinkaus' Schroeder warned.</p>
