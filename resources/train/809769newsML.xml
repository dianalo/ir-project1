<p>A powerful time bomb explosion wrecked the office of a former Greek public order minister on Tuesday but there were no injuries, police said.</p>
<p>The bomb was left in a plastic bag at the entrance of the fifth floor office of Socialist parliamentary deputy Stelios Papathemelis near Syndagma Square in central Athens.</p>
<p>Greece's socialist government strongly condemned the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;The terrorist attack against the office of parliamentary deputy Stelios Papathemelis is the work of bullying cowards trying to undermine democracy,&quot; government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said in a statement.</p>
<p>Two Athens newspapers said they had received phonecalls from unknown people saying they represented the Revolutionary Nucleus urban guerrilla group and warning the bomb would expode in minutes.</p>
<p>Police ordered the evacuation of the building. Fire engines rushed to the area and firefighters rescued an elderly woman trapped in the elevator due to a power cut after the blast.</p>
<p>Special anti-terrorist police units scoured the building for traces of the explosives used in the time bomb.</p>
<p>&quot;We had received threats in the past,&quot; Antonis Naxakis, a friend of Papathemelis' who had been at the office shortly before the explosion, told Greek television.</p>
<p>Papathemelis, 59, who served as public order minister -- responsible for the Greek police -- from October 1993 to March 1995, was in the northern city of Salonika during the attack.</p>
<p>He told television his secretary had been warned by police and had seen the bomb outside the office door.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Nucleus group has claimed responsibility in the past for several bomb attacks against cars owned by foreign diplomats and Greek businessmen.</p>
<p>Greece's leftist urban guerrillas often target Greek politicians and dignitaries in their bombing campaigns.</p>
