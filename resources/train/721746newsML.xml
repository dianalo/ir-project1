<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair is digging in his heels for a showdown with rank and file members of the ruling Labour party unhappy with his plans to tighten his already strong grip over policy-making.</p>
<p>In his first major speech to a Labour audience since his landslide victory in the May 1 election, aides say that Blair will tell activists on Saturday he has no intention of moderating his blueprint for overhauling the way the party is run.</p>
<p>&quot;It is courage that brought us victory on May 1 and it will deliver us victories in the future,&quot; Blair will tell Labour's youth and women's conference in Bournemouth, southern England.</p>
<p>A total of 89 motions opposed to the reforms, contained in a document called &quot;Labour into Power&quot;, have been submitted to Labour's annual conference in September.</p>
<p>Only nine are broadly in favour.</p>
<p>The reforms would shift policy-making power from the annual conference to a high-level committee, headed by Blair, that would draw on ideas developed by local policy forums.</p>
<p>In a sign of his determination not to back down, Blair's aides disclosed that 95 such forums have been planned up and down Britain starting in September.</p>
<p>The aim is to rein in the power of left-wing activists and avoid policy clashes between the annual conference and the government that have dogged past Labour administrations.</p>
<p>&quot;Modernisation did not stop on May 1. Modernisation goes on,&quot; the prime minister will say.</p>
<p>Blair set the stage for Labour's first election victory in 18 years by single-mindedly ditching its old socialist policies and recasting the party in his own moderate mould.</p>
<p>Aides said he also expected to get his own way in September, despite disquiet among grassroots members who fear they and the conference will be reduced to rubber-stamping Blair's policies.</p>
<p>&quot;He's confident,&quot; one aide said simply.</p>
<p>In Saturday's speech, Blair, who has a record-breaking 83 percent approval rating, will reaffirm that his government will not duck the tough decisions on economic policy, education and the welfare state needed to bring Britain up to the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything we do will be geared to Britain's long-term strength, stability and prosperity,&quot; Blair will say.</p>
<p>&quot;Some say making hard choices will lose us support. But we did not win by taking the easy route,&quot; Blair, who calls Labour the finest political fighting force in Europe, will add.</p>
