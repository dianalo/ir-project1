<headline>UK's Redwood pitches anti-EU Tory leadership bid.</headline>

<p>John Redwood, one of six former ministers vying for leadership of Britain's opposition Conservative Party, pitched himself on Thursday as the man to see off unwanted advances from the European Union.</p>
<p>Redwood told a gathering of party faithful and reporters of his five-point plan to win back lost Tory (Conservative) voters but said all of them would count for nothing if Britain's new Labour government signed the European Union's Treaty of Amsterdam next month.</p>
<p>The treaty proposes a common EU foreign policy, a joint defence policy and the removal of Britain's rights to control its own borders, he said. &quot;We must awaken our country from its slumbers. There will be little point in general elections in the future if all these powers are surrendered.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has pledged to keep border controls and said defence will remain an intergovernmental issue but Redwood, who unsuccessfully challenged former Prime Minister John Major for the Conservative Party leadership in 1995, was not letting that spoil his campaign pitch.</p>
<p>The EU Amsterdam summit will take place in mid-June and will attempt to produce a new Treaty timetabling moves to a full single market and European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;There is only one answer the UK can give to such proposals. The answer is no,&quot; Redwood said.</p>
<p>The key 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs last night voted former defence minister Sir Archie Hamilton as its leader and is expected to rule on Thursday how the leadership campaign will be conducted.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, the Observer newspaper polled half of the 164 Conservative MPs in parliament and found former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke -- the only Europhile standing for the leadership -- ahead but only because the vote was split between the rest, all of whom are Eurosceptic to some degree.</p>
<p>The poll showed 21 MPs backing Clarke, 16 opting for William Hague, Peter Lilley and Michael Howard level-pegging with 14 supporters each and John Redwood on 12. Stephen Dorrell brought up the rear on five.</p>
<p>Dorrell, Health Secretary until three weeks ago, attempted to revive his leadership chances on Thursday, praising Major's leadership but saying the Conservative Party must now rebuild to woo back the supporters lost on May 1.</p>
<p>Redwood agreed but was implicitly less flattering to the former Prime Minister. &quot;All too many in our party have had their loyalties stretched, often to breaking point, in recent years. I want all those Conservatives to come back home.&quot;</p>
<p>His five-point plan was thin on detail but pledged better education and jobs for the young, protection for Britain's countryside and heritage, a crackdown on teenage offenders, a health and welfare system to take care of all in need and the creation of a new &quot;army&quot; of shareholders and homeowners.</p>
