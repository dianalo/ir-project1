<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Wednesday he expected the German economy to grow by between two and 2.5 percent this year.</p>
<p>Speaking before a conference of his Christian Democrats (CDU) which will adopt a policy on pensions reform, Kohl also said a 25 billion mark construction investment drive agreed by his cabinet on Tuesday would create well over 100,000 jobs.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are signs that the mood is changing in the economy,&quot; Kohl told reporters.</p>
<p>The government's 1997 budget is based on an assumption of growth of 2.5 percent, but that goal is seen as under threat following a dramatic rise in unemployment during the winter to a post-war record 4.7 million.</p>
<p>Despite the lost tax revenues and extra benefit costs caused by extra joblessness, the government has stood by its goal of cutting the budget deficit to below three percent of gross domestic product this year.</p>
<p>Hitting that target would make it easier for Germany to lead a group of countries with strong records of monetary stability into European monetary union in 1999.</p>
