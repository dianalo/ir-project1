<headline>US backs unlimited carrier liability for crashes.</headline>

<p>U.S. authorities have agreed to scrap air carrier liability limits for passengers, clearing the last major hurdle towards unlimited compensation for victims of air disasters and dependents, the world airlines body said.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based International Air Transport Association (IATA), grouping 254 airlines, said on Wednesday that a global inter-carrier accord could be in place soon following approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) on January 8.</p>
<p>Spokesman William Gaillard said the accord had been signed by more than 80 airlines representing 80 percent of scheduled international air traffic and including all big global carriers.</p>
<p>It was likely to come into force following a February 3-5 meeting in Miami to study technical details of implementation.</p>
<p>The accord means airlines will move quickly after a crash to negotiate reasonable and just payments, abandoning ceilings for accident compensation set after World War II and widely seen as too low and outdated.</p>
<p>Once the accord is in force, liability will be settled by courts which will decide damages based on individual cases and the economic value of passengers.</p>
<p>&quot;This means that damages could go up to $1 million for, say, a chief executive officer of a big company with eight kids,&quot; Gaillard said.</p>
<p>Under the accord, the Inter-Carrier Agreement on Passenger Liability, airlines will negotiate promptly with victims' relatives or their lawyers to agree on a sum to be paid.</p>
<p>At present, under the industry's 1929 Warsaw Convention, airlines are restricted to compensation payments -- varying from country to country -- which specialist lawyers say are &quot;grossly inadequate and unsustainable.&quot;</p>
<p>The limits range from $75,000 in the United States to $150,000 in Europe and $350,000 in Australia.</p>
<p>To obtain more, injured crash victims or the families of the dead have had to engage in costly court proceedings, often stretching out over months and even years, to prove negligence on the part of the company involved.</p>
<p>IATA had initially set Jan. 1, 1997, as the target for the accord to come into force. The accord had been stalled by a dispute over its terms between IATA and DOT.</p>
<p>Gaillard said the DOT, which supervises the world's biggest single civil aviation market, had finally approved the terms of the accord following pressure from consumer groups and families of air crash victims.</p>
<p>Airlines themselves have long chafed at the inter-governmental Warsaw Convention limits as legal costs for judicial hearings have soared, especially in the United States. They have been usually capped by large out-of-court settlements.</p>
<p>The five European carriers -- Austrian Airlines, Finnair, Dutch KLM, Scandivania's SAS and Swissair -- as well as Switzerland's Crossair, Dutch KLM Cityhopper, Martinair and Transavia, indicated they would apply the pact immediately.</p>
