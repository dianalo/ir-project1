<p>Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Wednesday reiterated Iran's support for Sudan's territorial integrity and called for an end to the conflict in Sudan, state-run Tehran radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran declares its support for the territorial integrity of Sudan and urges an end to the internal conflict in this country,&quot; Rafsanjani was quoted by the radio as telling visiting Sudanese Vice-President al-Zubeir Mohammad Saleh.</p>
<p>Saleh handed to Rafsanjani a message from Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir in which the Sudanese leader thanked Iran for its &quot;principled position&quot; on the conflict, it said.</p>
<p>Tehran has close ties with Khartoum's Islamist government. Iran has condemned &quot;all acts of aggression&quot; in Sudan and supported the country's unity and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>Iranian media have accused the United States and Israel of conspiring to bring down the Khartoum government. Washington accuses both Tehran and Khartoum of sponsoring terrorism, charges denied by the two countries.</p>
<p>In a commentary, Tehran radio said ...&quot;the military onslaught on Sudan has exposed parts of colonial plans to exert a new kind of pressure on Islamic countries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that the recent military operations would not have occurred if the supply of aid to Sudan's enemies had been stopped,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>Sudan has denied rebel reports that Iran has given the Sudanese army weapons, including banned chemical arms, cash and even troops for the fighting.</p>
<p>Sudan says Ethiopia and Eritrea are behind the clashes in the east of the country. Both neighbouring states and the rebels deny this.</p>
<p>Iran, which last year mediated in Sudan's conflict with Uganda, has called on the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League to help end the crisis.</p>
<p>Saleh earlier this month explained Khartoum's view of the conflict in visits to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Syria.</p>
