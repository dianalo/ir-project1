<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- up 1/8 as retail sits out.</headline>

<p>U.S. municipal bond prices gained about 1/8 point in early trading Thursday, though traders said retail investors had all but abandoned them.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm frightened of these levels,&quot; one retail trader said. &quot;The levels are just huge. Everybody's got rate shock.&quot;</p>
<p>But a second trader said institutions are helping the market maintain a firm tone. &quot;Retail will just sit on the sidelines or go into stocks at these levels, but we've got an institutional pickup in demand,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Thursday's data included jobless claims for the week ended July 12, which the Labor Department said fell to 347,000, close to the 345,000 forecast.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said June housing starts rose 4.8 percent to 1.452 million, also close to predictions.</p>
<p>Treasuries also gained slightly after the data, with the long bond up 4/32 at 102-1/32 to yield 6.47 percent.</p>
<p>September municipal bond futures rose 7/32 to 120-20/32, while September Treasury bond futures gained 4/32 to 114-26/32. The MOB spread widened to 186 ticks from 183 at the close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, bids on Dade County, Fla., FGIC 5-1/4s of 2021 were down one basis point to 5.37 percent.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority FGIC 5.0s of 2027 were down three basis points, to 5.32 percent, after shedding four basis points in Wednesday's session.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's Blue List of secondary market offerings again dropped below $1 billion Thursday, falling to $989 million from Wednesday's $1.056 billion.</p>
<p>Municipal bond sales for Thursday were expected to total $422 million in 22 sales, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.</p>
<p>Negotiated offerings total $133 million in eight sales, with a $32 million Colorado Regional Transportation District offering through George K. Baum &amp; Co. topping the list.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, 14 sales totaling $290 million are scheduled. A $200 million Florida Department of Transportation offering at 1100 EDT is the largest.</p>
