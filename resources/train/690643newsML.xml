<p>Swedish producer prices for domestic sales in May rose sharply because of higher meat prices, Statistics Sweden said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Statistics Sweden said earlier that Swedish producer prices rose 0.7 percent in May for a year-on-year rise of 1.4 percent compared to market expectations of a monthly rise of 0.3 percent and a 12 month increase of 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>Behind this figure was a 0.9 percent rise in producer prices for home sales in May compared to April, which was the largest monthly rise in this figure since early 1995.</p>
<p>However Statistics Sweden said higher meat prices were behind a large part of the hike.</p>
<p>&quot;Higher prices on meat and meat products were behind 0.4 percentage points of the increase,&quot; Statistics Sweden said in a statement.</p>
<p>Export prices rose 0.4 percent from April to May because of higher prices on pulp and forestry products.</p>
<p>Import prices rose on average 0.2 percent in May from April. Higher prices on petroleum accounted for 0.3 percentage points of this rise.</p>
