<p>-- GENETIC PRODUCTS ROW WORSENS</p>
<p>According to US secretary of agriculture Dan Glickman, the European Union proposal to label genetically modified agricultural products is 'unacceptable' and will lead to restrictions in trade, as it would segregate a bulk commodity. EU agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler declared he understands the US reasoning, but that European consumers wanted to know exactly what it was they were eating. The Commission is to discuss the issue and will put forward proposals in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>-- UNIPART IN MOVE TO SUPPLY NHS</p>
<p>UK motor components manufacturing and distribution group Unipart has entered a joint venture with the government's Buying Agency, with a goal of cutting hundreds of millions of pounds from the NHS's 4.4 billion stg per year supplies bill. A new Unipart company formed in the venture called Surestock will link the 450 NHS trusts' purchasing operations with the numerous variety of suppliers which provide the Service with everything from needles to scanners and property maintenance services.</p>
<p>-- PRIVATE PRISONS PROJECT WILL BE CONTINUED</p>
<p>Citing the unprecedented rise in prison population and the government's adopted spending limits as reasoning, UK home secretary Jack Straw revealed the government is to renew one contract for a privately run prison and invite bids to construct and operate two more. The move comes as a blow to those who had been hoping Labour would signal an end to further private sector management. Straw added that the government will continue to examine long-term ways private-run prisons could be returned to public sector management.</p>
<p>-- VIRGIN ACQUISITION ADDS SPICE TO NEW LABEL</p>
<p>Virgin Records has approached BMG senior executive Hugh Goldsmith over the prospect of launching a new record label. Goldsmith has reportedly been given 'carte blanche' to develop the currently unnamed label which will be geared towards pop acts. The move comes as part of massive restructuring at Virgin, with former Virgin (UK) managing director Paul Conroy becoming president of the new company and his former deputies becoming joint managing directors.</p>
<p>-- DIVIDENDS DO NOT HIT R&amp;D, ANALYSIS SAYS</p>
<p>An academic analysis sponsored by the National Association of Pension Funds has revealed that companies paying dividends are more likely to invest in research and development than those that do not pay dividends. The conclusion of the analysis is that UK companies do not sacrifice growth opportunities through excessive dividend payments. The report comes at a time when the Labour government is believed to be considering dropping the 20 percent tax credit on dividend payment.</p>
<p>-- LONDON TRANSPORT OPERATING SURPLUS UP 30 PERCENT</p>
<p>London Transport's chairman Peter Ford announced on Thursday that despite operating surplus at the company having increased 30 percent in 1996, it was still looking for the government to inject short-term funds to fill a void left by the Conservative government's last Budget. LT hopes that in the long run, the government will solve its investment backlog by setting up a new financial regime. The government is currently examining the possibility of allowing private sectors to take a majority stake in LT.</p>
<p>-- YORKSHIRE CHIEF SEEKS SUPPORT FOR GRANADA BID</p>
<p>Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television (YTT), is to visit with the institutional investors who remain opposed to the takeover bid from the Granada Group. Among the institutions believed to be opposed to the bid are LGT Investors, Royal Sun Alliance, Fidelity, Schroder Asset Management and Barclays Global Investors. In total, institutional investors control 30 percent of YTT, with United News &amp; Media holding an extra five percent. Revenues at YTT have been down over the past few weeks, due in large part to competition from Channel 5.</p>
<p>-- EMU FEARS BOOST DOLLAR BONDS</p>
<p>With investors worried over the prospects of a European economic and monetary union, the volume of US international bonds issued in US dollars hit a weekly record high on Thursday. Almost $14.5 billion in new dollar-denominated bond offerings have hit the market since Monday, surpassing the previous weekly record of $14.2 billion set earlier in the month. Bond economists cite concern of a 'soft' euro currency, which would reduce returns on euro-denominated bonds once the proceeds were converted into dollars, as the central reasoning behind strong US activity.</p>
<p>-- MDIS WARNS OF 'VERY SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES'</p>
<p>The financially troubled computer services group, McDonnell Information Systems (MDIS), has warned that old software development contracts will lead to 'very substantial losses' for the year to December 31, 1996. MDIS chief executive John Klein declared that the company was 'saddled' with delivering on contracts which range in value from 500,000 stg to eight million stg, contracts entered in 1995 as sales people battled to lift the company's revenues.</p>
<p>-- LYNX ENDS KALAMAZOO TALKS</p>
<p>Acquisitive computer services group Lynx Holdings has withdrawn from takeover talks with the Kalamazoo Computer Group due to what it referred to as slow progress of talks. Part of the disagreement between the two groups concerned the uncertainty surrounding the ability of Kalamazoo Trust, the fund controlling 40 percent of Kalamazoo shares for the benefit of past and present employees, to sell its shares. Kalamazoo also revealed that news of its talks with Lynx had attracted 'a number of additional approaches' from other companies interested in bidding.</p>
