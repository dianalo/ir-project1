<title>CANADA: Activist wins in court against two Canadian banks.</title>
<headline>Activist wins in court against two Canadian banks.</headline>
<dateline>MONTREAL 1997-01-15</dateline>

<p>Shareholder activist Yves Michaud won on Wednesday a court ruling ordering two big Canadian banks to include in their shareholder proxy circulars his proposals on limiting senior executive pay.</p>
<p>Quebec Appeal Court Judge Jean-Louis Baudouin refused requests by the Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada to stay a lower court decision requiring them to include Michaud's proposals in their circulars.</p>
<p>Michaud's proposals call for limiting executives' pay to 20 times that of an average bank employee, limiting director's tenure and preventing bank executives from becoming chairman.  </p>
<p>In court, the bank's lawyers argued that Michaud held only one share of each bank, was fighting a personal campaign against bank management and was simply seeking publicity.</p>
<p>But after the ruling, the Royal Bank said it accepted the judge's decision and would include Michaud's proposals in the notice to be sent to shareholders on January 22 for the March 5 annual meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;We will include Michaud's proposals together with a statement on each of them,&quot; said Langevin Cote, a Royal Bank spokesman.  </p>
<p>Cote would not comment on whether the bank would continue its appeal of the legal issues in the case.</p>
<p>At Montreal's courthouse, Michaud told reporters that Royal Bank shareholders could very well turn down his proposals, but that he was not able financially to poll them on the issue.</p>
<p>Michaud said his &quot;fight for corporate democracy&quot; was based on the 1994 Dey report on Corporate Governance to the Toronto Stock Exchange, adding that the court decision would set a precedent for all Canadian companies.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm acting for scores of bank shareholders who have sound and practical proposals to include in proxy material and have been refused by management,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Laurentian Bank of Canada, a schedule II bank controlled by Desjardins Laurentian Financial Corp, earlier said it would include Michaud's proposals in its proxy circular.</p>
