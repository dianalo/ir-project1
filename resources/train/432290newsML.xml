<p>A new noninvasive treatment for fibroids may provide some women with an alternative to the surgical removal of the uterus known as hysterectomy, doctors said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The procedure, presented at a medical conference here, involves a quarter-inch (about 0.5 cm) incision and uses a catheter to cut off blood flow to the fibroid, a technique known as embolization. It leaves the uterus in place, said Dr. Scott Goodwin, chief of vascular and interventional radiology (corrects from &quot;radiation&quot;) at UCLA Medical Center, a pioneer in this procedure.</p>
<p>More than a half-million U.S. women have hysterectomies each year, about one-third because of fibroids, which are non-cancerous growths that can cause pain and bleeding.</p>
<p>There has been a raging controversy for years about whether many of these hysterectomies are unnecessary, and specialists have searched for alternative treatments that preserve the womb.</p>
<p>The study Goodwin presented at the conference of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology was small, involving 10 patients followed for up to eight months. The procedure has been used on other patients at UCLA, as well as in hospitals in Philadelphia and Paris.</p>
<p>Interventional radiology is a hot field involving new imaging technology that enables doctors to guide through the body tiny medical devices such as catheters and balloons.</p>
<p>These less invasive procedures are often alternatives to traditional surgery, which generally requires larger incisions and longer recovery.</p>
<p>Doctors have used embolization on other organs, but not on fibroids. In this case, the doctor makes a small incision in the groin and guides a catheter into the artery. Tracking it by x-ray, the doctor guides the catheter to the uterus and the fibroid. There, it injects particles to block the artery and cut off the blood flow to the fibroid.</p>
<p>Goodwin said eight of the 10 patients reported significant improvement of their symptoms. On average the fibroids shrank to about a third of their size.</p>
<p>One patient had less bleeding but not less pain, but the pain later proved to be an unrelated problem. And the 10th patient ended up needing a hysterectomy.</p>
<p>&quot;Because we don't know the effect on fertility, we recommend women who are trying to get pregnant to not have embolization done,&quot; Goodwin said. Those women should try another uterine-preserving technique called laparoscopy.</p>
<p>A woman can no longer bear children after her uterus has been removed in a hysterectomy.</p>
