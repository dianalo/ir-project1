<title>USA: NYMEX oil complex ends up on bullish stock draws.</title>
<headline>NYMEX oil complex ends up on bullish stock draws.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-27</dateline>

<p>The NYMEX oil complex ended higher Friday after weekly oil inventory data showed bullish draws in crude and distillate stocks when traders had expected stock increases.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices started out higher, and they stayed there. The APIs were pretty much the story,&quot; said Al Lindseth, manager of oil and gas hedge programs at GSC Energy in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Feb crude ended up 30 cents at $25.22 a barrel. Jan heating oil ended up 0.49 cent a gallon at 70.55 cents. Jan gasoline ended up 0.23 cent a gallon at 69.74 cents. Volume was thin as traders extended the Christmas holiday through the week.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed a draw of 1.89 million barrels in distillate stocks for the week ended December 20. Distillate stocks are comprised of heating oil and diesel.</p>
<p>Crude stocks fell 5.16 million barrels while gasoline stocks grew 504,000 barrels.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed a draw of 300,000 barrels in gasoline stocks in its own weekly inventory data Thursday, as well as draws in distillate and crude.  </p>
<p>Dealers had been expecting distillate stocks to increase by about 500,000 barrels. It was, however, draws in diesel stocks not heating oil stocks that accounted for the distillate stock fall. Heating oil stocks actually grew overall by 284,000 barrels.</p>
<p>Crude stocks had been expected to rise nearly two million barrels though there were less imports than anticipated.</p>
<p>But, heating oil prices were seen on shaky ground due to forecasts of unseasonably warm weather which should soften demand in the key heating oil market of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>Weather Services Corp forecasted above average temperatures through the weekend in the Northeast. The National Weather Service's six to 10 day forecast on Friday also called for above average temperatures in the region when dealers had expected a colder forecast.</p>
<p>Amid the expected drop in heating oil demand, a large amount of distillate supply was heading to the Northeast via the Houston-to-New York Colonial Pipeline, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still plenty of distillate barrels floating about the (U.S.) Gulf,&quot; said John Bradberry, vice president at Continental Ozark Inc, a petroleum distributor based in Arkansas.</p>
<p>The Colonial Pipeline said last week that there was still more shipment demand than its huge distillate line can handle, so it would continue to ration space on the line through January 1997.</p>
