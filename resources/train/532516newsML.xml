<p>Volunteers struggled on Wednesday to maintain power and telephone services in this disaster-stricken region as the Red River flooded more areas on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border.</p>
<p>At least 90 percent of this evacuated city of 50,000 was under water from the bulging Red River, which extended its widening path of destruction northward into Canada.</p>
<p>The next big city in the floodpath is the provincial capital of Winnipeg and experts doubt whether the city's massive diversion channel can handle the record-high water levels. Two Manitoba boys have already drowned in the rising flood waters.</p>
<p>About 17,000 residents of the Red River Valley between the U.S. border and Winnipeg were ordered out of their homes early on Wednesday, Manitoba Emergency Management Organisation spokesman Ed Peters said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the high temperatures of the last few days, the watershed and tributaries are flooding faster. The evacuations are taking place because the rising waters are expected to cut off access to these communities,&quot; Peters said.</p>
<p>In the United States, evacuees received a boost on Tuesday when President Bill Clinton toured flooded areas by helicopter and pledged almost half a billion federal dollars to help. Clinton saw first hand the incredible destruction caused by an ice storm, a blizzard, the flood and then last weekend's devastating downtown fire.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't recall ever in my life seeing anything like this,&quot; Clinton said. It was, he said, &quot;not an ordinary disaster.&quot;</p>
<p>Floodwaters overwhelmed the city's water treatment plant on Saturday, and it may take a month before the water and sewer systems are running at all. But the fight continued on Wednesday to maintain other essential services.</p>
<p>National Guard troops spent the night filling sandbags and bolstering dikes outside the power plant in Grand Forks, which still serves hundreds of customers in outlying areas.</p>
<p>Workers cleared water from the basement of the telephone company building, the only business still operating in the flood zone. Rumours of a failing telephone system in the Grand Forks area were false, officials with U S West said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no major problems. We are ahead of the battle,&quot; U S West spokesman Larry Ellingson said.</p>
<p>In the river town of Drayton, 40 miles (64.37 km) downstream from Grand Forks, residents were building a wooden support dike to buttress a clay and sandbag revetment.</p>
<p>&quot;The river's coming up slow,&quot; said Merl Defoe, at the town's temporary flood planning centre.</p>
<p>Both Drayton and the border town of Pembina have been evacuated to avoid possible injuries should the fragile dikes give way. The filthy floodwaters already contain raw sewage and disintegrating animal carcasses.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Dole, head of the American Red Cross, was expected to tour the disaster zone later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Work is already under way to rebuild shattered communities. Five Grand Forks retailers reopened their doors on Tuesday after being shut by the weekend flood. Residents retrieved their mail at the Air Force base 15 miles (24.14 km) west of Grand Forks, where the number of evacuees in a makeshift shelter dwindled.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service's official flood gauge broke on Saturday, so officials have been taking manual readings of the river level in Grand Forks. The latest readings showed the river hovering right around the projected crest at 54 feet (16.46 metres).</p>
