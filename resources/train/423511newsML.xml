<p>Lassa fever has killed nine people in eastern Sierra Leone and doctors say that the outbreak is the worst on record there.</p>
<p>Doctor Simon Mardel of the British aid agency Medical Emergency Relief International (MERLIN) told Reuters by telephone from Kenema that 74 sufferers had been admitted to hospital there in February -- the highest number on record.</p>
<p>&quot;This is clearly the worst (lassa) epidemic -- and I mean epidemic in the real sense -- in Sierra Leone to date. There has definitely been a rapid deterioration recently,&quot; Mardel said.</p>
<p>The lassa fever ward only opened last May but doctors say figures for February 1996 show only 10 cases and the annual average is usually around 35.</p>
<p>Lassa fever, spread by rats urine and faeces or between humans in the same way as the common cold, causes fever, minor haemorrhaging, vomiting, chest pains and low blood pressure. It killed about one in four people infected in 1996.</p>
<p>The disease in endemic in eastern Sierra Leone but Mardel blamed the surge on poverty caused by almost five years of civil war and a rise in the rat population.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't have the mechanisms to destroy the rats or protect their food. The human element of transmission has also increased because of overcrowding and, as a result of the war, there is less access to health care,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The only known cure, Ribavirin, a costly drug previously donated by the United States is no longer produced there.</p>
<p>&quot;We have only one week's supply left,&quot; Mardel said. &quot;We are now looking for another source, maybe China or Russia.&quot;</p>
