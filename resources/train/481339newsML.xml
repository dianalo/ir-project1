<p>The state attorney prosecuting 10 police officers allegedly involved in a highly publicised, videotaped murder said on Wednesday that thuggery was chronic among Brazilian police, but that it was very rarely punished.</p>
<p>Sao Paulo state prosecutor Fernando Nucci said he was digusted by senior government officials who said the March 6 murder of 31-year-old mechanic, Mario Jose Josino, by police officers was an isolated case.</p>
<p>&quot;What was unusual about this case was that it was filmed and shown on prime time TV, and that for once, the Brazilian middle class had a chance to see how their police officers behave,&quot; Nucci told Reuters.</p>
<p>Josino's murder has dominated newspaper headlines since Monday when Brazilian television showed an amateur video of a group of Sao Paulo police officers who used their batons to beat and extort money out of drivers at a roadblock.</p>
<p>The video, taped over the course of three nights by an anonymous person, showed how the police tortured and intimidated civilian occupants of a car that was ordered to stop and pull over one night.</p>
<p>The video showed that after the men were released, one of the policemen fired his gun at the car. Authorities later confirmed Josino, who was in the back seat, died in a hospital as a result of the officer's bullet.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the 10 policemen in the video were charged with murder, battery, graft and conspiracy. If found guilty, they could face up to 30 years in prison.</p>
<p>Nucci said the video showed the police were intent on committing a crime from the moment the roadblock was set up. He said the tape shows that the officers deliberately tore off their name tags and wore their caps backwards in an attempt to not be recognised.</p>
<p>The officer who fired the fatal shot was also seen on the videotape using a non-regulation gun. Nucci said this was a common trick adopted by bandit police to eliminate any evidence that could be used against them.</p>
<p>&quot;They know the rules, so they will do everything in their power to tamper the evidence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nucci said the Sao Paulo police force had powerful allies among politicians and in the courts and was capable of derailing any serious corruption investigation.</p>
<p>Human rights groups claim they have documented hundreds of cases of police violence, but there was neither the political will nor the legal instruments to prosecute offenders.</p>
<p>Nucci said he hoped the publicity surrounding Josino's murder would prompt lawmakers into approving tougher laws against corrupt police. &quot;If there is any good to come out this, it will be a revision of the penal code under which the police are tried,&quot; he said.</p>
