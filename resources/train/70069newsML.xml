<p>Russia's communist opposition on Monday called on Boris Yeltsin to resign because of his heart condition after a doctor said he may be too sick for planned surgery.</p>
<p>Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, beaten by Yeltsin in a presidential election earlier this year, accused the Kremlin leader of deceiving the electorate by keeping quiet about his illness during the campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;(Concealing the heart attack) amounts to falsification. The elections were not fair,&quot; Zyuganov told Reuters at the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In Moscow, the communist speaker of the State Duma lower house of parliament said the 65-year-old Yeltsin should step down if the surgeons refused to operate and told him he had to simply eke out his life by avoiding stress and overwork.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in Russia is such that (the president) cannot have an easy work schedule,&quot; Gennady Seleznyov told reporters.</p>
<p>Renat Akchurin, who is expected to lead a heart bypass operation on the president, said at the weekend that surgery might be put off for 1-1/2 to two months to prepare Yeltsin.</p>
<p>He said there was a risk of surgery being cancelled altogether, a move that would consign Yeltsin to a very limited lifestyle.</p>
<p>Akchurin said the Kremlin probably covered up a heart attack, his third, during the  presidential campaign. Aides at the time said he suffering from a cold or a sore throat. Others said he was just tired.</p>
<p>Russian media, freed by Yeltsin from the censorship of the Soviet period, gave only scant coverage to reports that Yeltsin might be a good deal sicker than the Kremlin has portrayed.</p>
<p>But Moscow's stock market slumped on foreign media reports.</p>
<p>The mounting communist campaign for Yeltsin to step down heightened the political uncertainty in Russia stemming from his ill-health. The Kremlin, meanwhile, retreated into silence.</p>
<p>A presidential spokesman said there may be no comment until a council of Yeltsin's doctors, including foreign experts, meets on Wednesday to decide whether, and when, to operate.</p>
<p>U.S. bypass pioneer Michael DeBakey, 88, flew in on Monday to take part in the meeting. He told reporters: &quot;I'm always optimistic.&quot;</p>
<p>Akchurin, DeBakey's former pupil who is likely to lead the operating team, said on Sunday: &quot;We will see how the patient is prepared for the operation...If the risk is justified, go and do the operation. If it is not, don't do silly things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An earlier date of the operation means bigger risks,&quot; he added, saying Yeltsin was in a &quot;fighting mood&quot; and anxious to press on. Akchurin said the strong-willed Yeltsin would probably not put up with being told he could not have the operation.</p>
<p>Zyuganov, 52, who finished 13.5 points behind Yeltsin in July's vote, made it clear on Friday he is eager for a second shot at power and thinks he can win.</p>
<p>With signs of a worsening economic crisis in the regions and a permanent threat of a flare-up in breakaway Chechnya despite last month's peace, Zyuganov could build on his showing in July.</p>
<p>Some communists also believe that, without Yeltsin, the ruling establishment may help them by fragmenting into factions -- speculation which has been fueled by signs of manoeuvring for power behind the Kremlin walls during Yeltsin's absence.</p>
<p>Yeltsin dropped out of sight before the July 3 runoff vote.</p>
<p>Yeltsin broke the secrecy on September 5 by saying he would have surgery at the end of the month to avoid a &quot;passive life&quot;.</p>
<p>Now he is in hospital under doctors' orders to take things even easier than in the summer, when he fished and hunted boar.</p>
<p>Russians and governments abroad are left guessing about who is running the nuclear-armed country whose grip on democracy is still fragile.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who would take over to organise new elections if Yeltsin were to step down, has been given some extra duties and will take over full presidential powers for the few hours Yeltsin is on the operating table.</p>
<p>But that has not quashed speculation of who would take over permanently if Yeltsin were to step down nor the impression that top officials are already jostling for position.</p>
<p>Some analysts said delay will change little because Yeltsin has managed to balance the powers of rival officials, including Chernomyrdin, 58, ambitious security chief Alexander Lebed, 46, and his chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais, 41.</p>
<p>But others disagreed, saying rivalry would increase and political instability would deepen as Yeltsin waits for surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;The longer the operation is put off, the more unstable the situation will be,&quot; said Lyudmila Telen of Moscow News weekly.</p>
<p>Other analysts said that could paralyse decision-making and let problems, particularly in the economy, go unsolved.</p>
