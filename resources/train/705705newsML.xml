<p>IPE Brent crude futures traded sideways to lower amid some light profit taking after Wednesday's late gains but short-covering ahead of the NYMEX opening on Thursday pulled the market back from the lows, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is good support in place on the way down and it didn't get tested, it just drifted lower under no pressure, one broker said.</p>
<p>By 1334 GMT the August Brent contract was trading 18 cents lower at $18.74 a barrel after touching off a low of $18.66.</p>
<p>Strong support around $18.50 as long as it is held continues to maintain the market's bullish sentiment and analysts see sufficient technical momentum to push the market through $19 later today.</p>
<p>Gas oil futures drifted lower in a market that appeared to be running out of buying momentum.</p>
<p>The July contract stood $1 lower at $166.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>Analyst were less bullish for the market on the technical side with Wednesday's open and close at the same $167.50 level seen as an indication of uncertainty and indecision by buyers that will not maintain an uptrend.</p>
<p>However, they said the market was difficult to gauge at the moment with the narrow ranges unsurprising ahead of a holiday period though they said short term RSIs were well into the overbought region.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude and unleaded look poised to move higher again today with technical indicators looking very positive despite &quot;high RSIs and toppy stochastics&quot;, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The trends are intact and the convergence of the five- and 15-day moving averages is very positive,&quot; said Charles Gray analyst at Prudential-Bache International Limited.</p>
<p>&quot;Stochastics and RSIs although high are not signalling a turnaround,&quot; Gray added. He said &quot;A move through $20.50 could spark a fast move to $20.85 a barrel&quot;.</p>
