<title>USA: U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS--prices climb, cash sidelined.</title>
<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS--prices climb, cash sidelined.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bonds climbed as much as 3/8ths of a point at the long end, as Treasuries added to last week's big gains, and some market players looked like they might have room for more bonds on their shelves.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people have money and no need to raise cash,&quot; a trader said, noting that selling pressure from bid-wanted lists had been fairly muted over the past week or so.</p>
<p>Consequently, trading in the secondary market was fairly quiet as the market reopened after the three-day weekend. Friday was the U.S. Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>Intermediates wer seen rising around 1/4 of a point, and the recent drop in yields looked likely to trigger additional refundings, but traders said it might take a little longer for them to surface.</p>
<p>The main reason for the broad gains in the fixed income market was the prospect that the Federal Reserve, which last week opted to keep interest rates steady, will not find enough evidence of rising inflation to change its stand anytime soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people feel comfortable, just given the economic numbers over the past couple of weeks, that the Federal Reserve is not going to do anything in August,&quot; a trader said, adding the central bank also was not expected to act in early autumn either.</p>
<p>A big drop in gold prices, which hit fresh, 12-year lows before rebounding sharply, also soothed inflation fears.</p>
<p>The market was looking ahead to the release of retail sales on Tuesday, with talk that some economists were lowering their forecasts in the wake of weak auto sales data.</p>
<p>In the municipal market, bond sales this week were expected to total $2.1 billion in 99 sales, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.</p>
<p>Municipal bond sales for Tuesday were pegged at $431 million in 30 sales.</p>
<p>Negotiated offerings added up to $273 billion in six sales, with a $150 million Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Calif., deal through Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., topping the list.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, 24 sales totaling $158 million are scheduled. A $27 million Freehold Township Board of Education, N.J., deal at 1100 EDT is the largest.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey bonds of 2026, which pay a 5-1/2 percent coupon, were bid at 99-7/8, up three-eighths.</p>
<p>And Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Sanitary Authority Sewer Revenues of 2024, which pay a 5-3/8 percent coupon, were bid at 5.53 percent, NET, down two basis points.</p>
<p>September Treasury bond futures ended up 15 ticks at 113-21/32, while September municipal bond futures rose 11 ticks to 119. This left the MOB spread a bit narrower at plus 171 ticks.</p>
