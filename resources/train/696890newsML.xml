<headline>Brady debt mostly higher ahead of FOMC this week.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-30</dateline>

<p>Brady bond prices were mostly higher on Monday as market participants dismissed any chance of a tightening in U.S. monetary policy by the Federal Open Market Committee when it meets this week. &quot;I don't think the FOMC is really making a lot of difference. I think there will be a very unpleasant surprise if the Fed does move but I think (U.S.) payrolls is dominating market sentiment now and not the FOMC,&quot; said Richard Gray, emerging market analyst at Bank of America In London.</p>
<p>Still, Gray and other analysts said the emerging debt market is poised to move higher this week because current levels on certain assets are cheap and offer good buying opportunities. Market specialists said end of the quarter buying should also help to buoy emerging market debt prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I am expecting to see some buying. Basically, the whole market should strengthen a little bit and obviously we will be taking the cue from the long bond later this week. I am expecting a rally in the long bond,&quot; said Jerome Booth, head of emerging market research at ANZ Investment in London.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we are likely to expect a big shock on payrolls,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The U.S. unemployment report, which is generally released on the first Friday of the month, is scheduled to be released on Thursday because of the U.S. Independence Day Holiday.</p>
<p>Of all the Brady bond countries, market experts agreed that Ecuador currently offers the best value.</p>
<p>Ecuador, which suffered sharp losses last week on rumours of a rift between cabinet ministers and President Fabian Alarcon, is expected to rebound further now that the rumours have been dispelled.</p>
<p>Ecuador's central bank general manager Fidel Jaramillo and Monetary Board President Danilo Carrera told reporters in Washington that they were not quitting.</p>
<p>Ecuadorean Finance Minister Carlos Davalos, who had tendered his resignation on Thursday, declined to answer a reporter's question in Washington on Friday on his resignation. But as of Friday, President Alarcon had not announced whether he would accept Davalos' resignation. &quot;I think Ecuadorean debt ought to be considered as the last high yield opportunity in Latin America,&quot; said Gray.</p>
<p>&quot;The value pick today is probably Ecuador. Prices came off last week but people will have worked out that there is no real change in fundamentals,&quot; added another emerging market analyst.</p>
<p>In London trade, Ecuadorean discount bonds  ECDISC=RR were 1/4 firmer at 71-3/4 bid. Among Eastern European debt instruments, Bulgarian Brady bonds scored the biggest gains ahead of the introduction of its currency board system on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bulgarian FLRB  were 3/8 higher at 56-7/8 bid and its discount bonds  were 5/8 firmer at 74 bid. --Diane Craft, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5110</p>
