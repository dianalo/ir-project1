<p>Fresh-faced teen pop trio Hanson joined forces with veteran Irish rockers U2 to boost music profits at PolyGram, but growing film losses saw first-half group profit dip slightly, PolyGram said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Overall net profit for the first six months of 1997 slipped to 270 million guilders ($132.9 million) from 272 million a year earlier -- a completely flat half-year performance since 1995 when the first-half net profit was also 270 million guilders.</p>
<p>Analysts had been anticipating a net profit of up to 286 million guilders, based on strong music sales from artists such as U2 and Hanson, with the consensus view at 276 million. Operating losses from films had been expected to continue.</p>
<p>First-half group sales climbed five percent to 4.53 billion guilders with music generating sales of 3.94 billion. Operating profit in music rose to 522 million guilders from 457 million during the half.</p>
<p>The film division saw first-half turnover dip to 589 million guilders from 681 million with operating losses widening to 92 million from 37 million.</p>
<p>Film's second-quarter operating loss was 37 million guilders compared to 55 million in the first quarter and 18 million in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Chief executive Alain Levy said the strategy at the film unit was on track to deliver break-even over the next two years.</p>
<p>&quot;Film strategy is on target. We always said 1997 would be a year of transition. There's nothing there to worry about,&quot; he said. &quot;We say 1998-99 for operating profit from film,&quot; he said reiterating a previous PolyGram forecast.</p>
<p>PolyGram said the results of its filmed entertainment business reflected the division's lighter release schedule during the first six months of 1997, adding the division expected its strongest releases in the second half.</p>
<p>The Dutch company, 75-percent owned by Philips Electronics NV, has recently released &quot;Bean,&quot; starring Rowan Atkinson, to enthusiastic audiences in Australia and the Netherlands. It plans to release mainstream movie &quot;The Game,&quot; starring Michael Douglas, in September.</p>
<p>Film during the first half of 1996 benefited from the success of &quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; &quot;Fargo,&quot; and &quot;Mr Holland's Opus.&quot;</p>
<p>At the first-quarter stage in April PolyGram said underperformance of previously released films &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; and &quot;Gridlock'd&quot; had hit its earnings.</p>
<p>PolyGram said the combination of sales from established artists such as U2 and the Bee Gees, along with those from breakthrough artists such as Hanson had delivered results in the first half.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite challenging conditions in some of our markets, PolyGram's expertise in breaking new acts and promoting established artists is reflected in the first half results,&quot; Levy said in a statement with results.</p>
<p>U2 sold over five million copies of their album &quot;Pop&quot; in the first half, while the Bee Gees sold 2.3 million albums. Newcomers Hanson -- decades younger than the Bee Gee trio of brothers -- sold three million copies of their album &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; in the second quarter.</p>
<p>In total nine albums sold over one million copies in the first half, compared to 15 in the first six months of 1996 when PolyGram released a bigger number of superstar albums.</p>
<p>Total unit sales for the top five albums in the first half of 1997 was 15 million compared to 13 million for the comparable period in 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company's performance was broadly as they expected, although the film side had been a little disappointing.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the film operation) is loss-making and will remain so for the time being. In the second half there are some good names, but we knew about them already. The prospects are good, but not spectacular,&quot; said Peter Wortel of Delta Lloyd Bank.</p>
<p>PolyGram shares closed 90 guilder cents firmer at 101.90 guilders on a sharply higher Amsterdam bourse, back from a session high of 106.10 soon after the results announcement. ($ = 2.031 Dutch Guilders)</p>
