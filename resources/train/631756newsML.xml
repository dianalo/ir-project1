<p>Insurance giant Liberty Mutual Group will take over California's financially-troubled Golden Eagle Insurance Co, one of largest writers of workers' compensation insurance in the state, state and company officials said Saturday.</p>
<p>Boston-based Liberty Mutual beat out American International Group Inc in a court-supervised auction to acquire San Diego's Golden Eagle, which was seized by the state Department of Insurance in January because of alleged financial irregularities, the officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're delighted with the court's decision and we look forward to a smooth and efficient transition,&quot; said John Cusolito, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual.</p>
<p>Liberty Mutual and the Department of Insurance said they would not discuss the terms of the deal over the weekend.</p>
<p>California Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush plans to release details about Liberty Mutual's winning bid at a press conference set for Monday in San Diego, department spokeswoman Dana Spurrier said.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, Quackenbush said: &quot;Golden Eagle Insurance Company has been stabilized and at least 1,000 San Diego jobs have been preserved.&quot;</p>
<p>American International Group had been expected to take over Golden Eagle. Two weeks ago, the Department of Insurance said it had finalized an agreement with American International, and that the company had won the bidding.</p>
<p>Golden Eagle, a company valued at $1.3 billion, wrote about $400 million of workers compensation and $300 million of property-casualty business in 1996, according to the Department of Insurance.</p>
<p>The state's Department of Insurance said it seized Golden Eagle after its investigators turned up evidence the company had manipulated its financial records. The department alleged that the records were changed to make it seem as if Golden Eagle had adequate reserves when in reality the company had a $138.5 million cash reserve shortfall.</p>
<p>Liberty Mutual, which is not a publicly trade company, has more than $40 billion in consolidated assets and $48 billion in assets under management. It is one of the largest insurers in the property/casualty field and is the leading provider of workers' compensation insurance in the United States. Sunday, 1 June 1997 18:02:50</p>
