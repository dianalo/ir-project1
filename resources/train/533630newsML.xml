<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The dollar had drifted lower against the yen by late afternoon Tokyo on Wednesday due to liquidation of long positions by short-term traders and sporadic sales by U.S. funds and exporters, dealers said.</p>
<p>But importers and those who had failed to buy dollars earlier remained keen to purchase the greenback below 126 yen, keeping the dollar's downside solid near 125.80 yen.  </p>
<p>Comments by Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governer Yasuo Matsushita that a rise in confidence about Japan's economy could lead to concerns about price rises became a yen buying factor for dollars, some dealers said. They added that his comments sparked fears of a possible rise in Japan's interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall prices are stable except for the impact from the sales tax increase, but potential concern about prices of goods may arise if confidence in the prospects for the economy increases,&quot; Matsushita was quoted as saying in a meeting between BOJ officials and officials of the Japan Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren).  </p>
<p>But overall trade remained range-bound during Asian trading time as traders were awaiting the Group of Seven (G7) meeting this weekend for clues to future dollar/yen direction.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders are not willing to take heavy long positions ahead of the Group of Seven (G7) meeting,&quot; a dealer at a city bank said. But he added that if the G7 meeting did not signal a strong warning against recent currency levels, the dollar would continue to edge up against the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>In the late morning, the dollar fell versus the yen as traders unloaded long positions built earlier after efforts to break through 126.50 yen ended in a failure.  </p>
<p>Exporters, eager to sell dollars before Japan's &quot;Golden Week&quot; holiday next week, and possibly some trust banks, placed offers above 126.50 yen, weighing on the dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>Although most dealers said expectations of dollar sales intervention by the Bank of Japan had somewhat receded and that their focus was now on the G7 meeting, a U.S. bank dealer said it was still dangerous to disregard the possibility.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have a few days before the G7 meeting, so we should be careful about possible intervention,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>But another U.S. bank dealer in Singapore said: &quot;The G7 will give them (markets) a bit of concern but I don't think people expect much from it.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar eased against the mark partly on offers from U.S. funds near 1.7160-70 marks in the morning. But the city bank dealer in Tokyo said dollar/mark trade was mostly directionless as political uncertainty in Europe with elections coming up in Britain and France may again spark a mark buying spree.</p>
