<title>UK: Oil prices stay buoyant on winter supply fears.</title>
<headline>Oil prices stay buoyant on winter supply fears.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fears over the possibility of a winter supply crunch kept oil prices buoyant on Thursday despite an easing of tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>London October futures for bellwether North Sea Brent blend closed up five cents at $22.17 a barrel, near its session high of $22.22 a barrel achieved on short-covering just before the close.</p>
<p>Brent shot up more than a dollar after Iraq's weekend military incursion into Kurdish safe havens and the consequent delay to Iraqi oil exports under a United Nations oil-for-food exchange.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday that retaliatory missile strikes against Iraq after its military incursion into Kurdish safe havens were over for the time being.</p>
<p>&quot;(The Iraqi oil sale delay) will certainly have a physical impact and on top of that there is this speculative factor,&quot; he said Cyrus Tahmassebi, president of Energy Trends Inc in Washington. &quot;There is a fear in the market that things could get out of control.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said jumpy markets remained vulnerable to news of further military action in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Prices twice spiked on Thursday on reports from Kurdish rebels that Iraqi forces were making fresh assaults in the region.</p>
<p>Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani, evicted by Iraq from Kurdish capital Arbil, said on Thursday that his forces were still under attack and that he was prepared to seek Iranian help to fight back.</p>
<p>Iraq's latest confrontation with the United States has forced an indefinite delay in the implementation of a U.N. agreement allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil to pay for food and medical supplies.</p>
<p>Without the extra Iraqi crude to help replenish low inventories, analysts expect to see crude prices stay buoyant, at higher levels than previously projected, for months to come.</p>
<p>Keith Hamm, chairman of London-based consultancy Petroleum Economics Ltd said he expects Brent to hold in a $19-$21 range during the fourth quarter this year.</p>
<p>He had previously estimated prices to fall through the bottom of that range later this year with revived Iraqi sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Just-in-time inventory management, Iraqi uncertainty and the winter weather conditions uncertainty could lead to greater price volatility,&quot; said Tahmessebi.</p>
