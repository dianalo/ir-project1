<p>President Boris Yeltsin is to meet his Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov on Wednesday to discuss a spate of violent incidents in southern Russia blamed on Chechen separatists, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>It said the meeting would take place at the Black Sea resort of Sochi where Yeltsin is spending a vacation, but gave no further details.</p>
<p>The situation around Chechnya, where 21 months of war between Moscow troops and rebels ended in a shaky truce in August, has badly deteriorated in the past week.</p>
<p>Russian police fought a brief night skirmish on Tuesday with a group of what they said were 20 Chechen fighters just outside Chechnya, resulting in casualties on both sides.</p>
<p>Two people were killed and more than 20 wounded on Monday in a powerful explosion at the railway station in the southern Russian spa resort of Pyatigorsk.</p>
<p>Kulikov said on Tuesday police had detained two Chechen women fighters suspected of organising the blast.</p>
<p>He told a news conference the two were part of a Chechen armed group which undertook a hostage raid on the Russian town of Budennovsk in 1995 in which more than 100 people were killed.</p>
<p>Russian news agencies quoted police sources as saying the Pyatigorsk attack was similar to a bomb blast at a railway station in the southern Russian town of Armavir last Wednesday which killed two people.</p>
<p>Kulikov demanded tough measures to counteract terrorism.</p>
<p>&quot;These are not rebels. This is not a political struggle,&quot; he said. &quot;This is banditry. We will catch and destroy those criminals.&quot;</p>
<p>His accusations were immediately denied by Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov, Itar-Tass news agency said. The separatist leaders accused unnamed Russian special services of planting a bomb to disrupt peacemaking.</p>
<p>Chechen Vice-President Vakha Arsanov, quoted by Interfax news agency, said talks on political matters were impossible until Kulikov apologised for his allegations or proved them.</p>
<p>But the latest tensions seemed to open differences in Moscow over how to handle Chechnya.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaking at a news conference in the Slovak capital Bratislava, condemned the Pyatigorsk attack but focused on the need to preserve peace talks with the rebels, in contrast with Kulikov's harsh words.</p>
<p>&quot;Terror is vandalism and innocent people die,&quot; he said. &quot;But our relations toward the (peace) treaty will not be affected by this...the Chechen leadership has denied any connection with these terrorist attacks.&quot;</p>
<p>The August ceasefire halted fighting but did not resolve the main dispute -- whether the rebel region is part of Russia or independent. They two sides are now involved in difficult negotiations over a long-term peace treaty.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's senior aide, Boris Berezovsky, who is heavily involved in shuttle diplomacy with Chechnya, appealed for restraint.</p>
<p>&quot;Irresponsible statements are being made today by those who have not had enough of the war in Chechnya,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Russian news agencies reported that Udugov and Berezovsky, a deputy head of Yeltsin's policy-making Security Council, agreed that peace talks should go ahead.</p>
