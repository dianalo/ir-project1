<p>SBC Communications Inc said on Wednesday that it filed a suit to declare part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 unconstitional, claiming that it discriminates against Regional Bell Operating Companies.</p>
<p>SBC said the law imposes restrictions that prohibit the Bell Companies from competing in long-distance and other services that other local exchange companies are free to provide.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, SBC said. It could not immediately be determined what government agencies were named as defendants in the suit.  </p>
<p>SBC's challenge comes after federal regulators last week blocked the company's bid to offer long distance in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>SBC said the challenge aims to eliminate restrictions that it deems unconstitional, so it could enter the long distance market, spurring more competition.</p>
<p>In complying with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the company has signed agreements with 170 competitors in its territory and will spend $1.2 billion in 1997 to meet the law's obligations.</p>
<p>MCI Communications Corp said in a separate statement that SBC's challenge to the law is &quot;absurd&quot; and is an attempt by SBC to avoid opening its market to local telephone service.</p>
<p>SBC said the law has targeted a select group of companies by name, placing an obstacle to their entry into the long-distance telephone business.</p>
<p>SBC said the provisions of the act violate the Constitution's separation of powers, the Bill of Attainder clause, the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment and infringes upon its First Amendment rights.</p>
