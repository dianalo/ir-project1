<title>UK: Lira surges as market searches for ERM entry rate.</title>
<headline>Lira surges as market searches for ERM entry rate.</headline>

<p>The Italian lira's surge back to 1,000 per mark took the currency markets by surprise Wednesday as it flew in the face of a stronger mark, a weaker domestic bond market and background jitters about French franc stability.</p>
<p>Speculation about a renewed push by French and German authorities to ensure the lira returns to the European exchange rate mechanism at a stronger cental peg than 1,000 seems to be the key driving force behind the latest move, analysts said.</p>
<p>Traders, meantime, cited a wave of lira orders and stop losses as accelerating the Italian unit's return to its strongest position in six weeks. A number of large orders to buy lire directly for French francs were also noted, they said.</p>
<p>Yet, most analysts said the latest wave of buying began following a report in the French daily Le Monde on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper report said French and other European government's have been irritated by massive Bank of Italy intervention to prevent the lira strengthening below 1,005 per mark lately. Crucially, the paper said French and German officials wanted the lira to return at a central rate of 950.</p>
<p>The Italian authorities have said in recent weeks that the passing of the 1997 budget in the lower house of the Italian parliament last weekend opened the way for the lira's return to the ERM. Thay have said the end of November is a likely date.</p>
<p>&quot;The Le Monde report about Italy trying to generate a cheap ERM entry rate was the start of all this,&quot; said Peter Von Maydell, sebnior currency economist at UBS.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has taken the view that if the Bank of Italy is that keen to cap the lira, trades will contiunue to test its resolve,&quot; said Von Maydell.</p>
<p>The UBS economist said he thinks the Italians are &quot;taking a leaf from the Spanish book&quot; by keeping the lira competitive while building up foreign exchange reserves for potential reversal of convergence trades in Italy next year.</p>
<p>At 1515 GMT, the lira was trading at 1,000.00/0.50 compared with 1,007.15/45 late Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Speculation about the ERM re-entry rate is pushing the lira higher again,&quot; said Julian Jessop, European economist at Nikko Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;What we now know from yesterday's report is that the Italians want a central ERM rate about 1,000 and the French and Germans are pushing for 950,&quot; said Jessop. &quot;The market chatter today is that they will approach a compromise level about 975.&quot;</p>
<p>Others are more skeptical. Georgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the lira's rise today confounded a more reasonable retreat in Italian bonds today and he felt the currency was riding for a fall.</p>
<p>&quot;The Italian budget fudge with this Euro tax is showing up the whole process as a bit of a joke,&quot; said Radaelli at Lehman. He was referring to the one-off tax in the Italian 1997 budget which is aimed squeezing the Italian budget deficit in line with European monetary union entry criteria next year.</p>
<p>Some analysts said that with such one-off accounting measures likely to be deemed unsustainable by the French and Germans, they may use their veto to delay lira entry to the ERM as a way of keeping the lira out of the first wave of monetary union.</p>
<p>Others said the long lira/short French franc trade was related to concern that if the French did not get a stronger lira ERM entry rate they would threaten to allow the franc to weaken on its other European exchange rates in compensation.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of background pressures on French exchange rate policy as we've seen again today and in this context the long lira/short franc trade is attractive,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Prendergast referred to reports today that former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing called for franc depreciation to the equivalent of 3.65 per mark and that ruling-RPR member of parliament Pierre Mazeaud called for a weaker franc and government cabinet reshuffle.</p>
<p>Le Monde, meantime, also reported today that the Bank of France was due to replace two members of its policy-making council at year end and speculation was rife about whether the new appointees would reflect the current policy status quo.</p>
