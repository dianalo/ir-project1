<headline>UPM says made bid for Repap.</headline>

<p>Finnish forest industry group UPM-Kymmene Oy late last year submitted a bid to acquire some parts of Canadian LWC paper maker Repap Enterprises Inc, UPM executive vice president Martin Granholm said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is true that we showed interest (to buy) certain parts (of Repap) at that time but the issue became void when Repap received an offer for its entire shareholding,&quot; Granholm told a Reuters reporter.</p>
<p>He was asked to comment on a report in business daily Kauppalehti, which said UPM had bid in late 1996 for Repap and was likely to do so again if the opportunity presented itself.  </p>
<p>&quot;The situation is still exactly at that stage,&quot; Granholm said referring to Canadian pulp and paper group Avenor Inc's bid for Repap, the success or failure of which is due to become clear on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;What may possibly be on its way we will return to at a later stage,&quot; Granholm said. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Avenor has made a C2.6 billion ($1.9 billion) offer to acquire Repap, but the plan was put in doubt on Monday after Canada's largest pension fund, which holds a 10 percent stake in Avenor, gave the deal a thumbs down and other institutional holders indicated they would also vote against the merger.</p>
<p>The merger of Avenor and Repap, both Montreal-based pulp and paper companies, was due to close if shareholders approved it on Wednesday. But it has met with significant shareholder resistance.</p>
<p>Avenor earlier this month cut its stock and debt offer to one Avenor share for every eight Repap shares and excluded Repap's British Columbia operations from the deal.</p>
<p>The original bid was one Avenor share for every 4.25 Repap shares, plus the assumption of C2.4 billion ($1.7 billion) in debt.</p>
<p>Kauppalehti said Repap's past strategy to buy undervalued paper and pulp mills and modernise them with debt financing had given it modern machinery and a leading position in light-weight-coated paper in North America.</p>
<p>Repap's downsides were its debts and pulp production, it said. --Helsinki newsroom +358-9-680 50 245, e-mail news@reuters.fi</p>
