<p>Sales of New Zealand discount retailer The Warehouse were up 18 percent in the four months to July 31 but same store sales were up just 0.7 percent, the company said on Friday.</p>
<p>It said August and September sales were up 14 percent on the same months in 1995.</p>
<p>Sales in the first three months of the period under review were quite strong with a weak trading period in July, it said.</p>
<p>Operating earnings over the four month period were $9.9 million, six percent of sales.  </p>
<p>During the period under review, the TUI information system, which had caused the company major problems when introduced, performed accurately as expected, The Warehouse said.</p>
<p>The company's new distribution centre was completed in August and commissioned in September. Operations at the centre were being progressively stepped up, and it would play a key role in distributing overseas sourced stock in the build up to Christmas 1996, the company said.</p>
<p>However operational benefits were yet to be recorded.</p>
<p>The tax paid profit of $5.26 million included a $431,000 loss resulting from the sale of property assets.</p>
