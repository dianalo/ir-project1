<title>USA: First of America Bank core profits improve.</title>

<p>First of America Bank Corp., which earlier reported lower third-quarter earnings after a one-time charge, said Monday its core profitability improved during the period.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased with the progress we have made in improving our profitability as we have been emphasizing the core benefit of our current franchise,&quot; said Richard Chormann, First of America's chairman, president and chief executive.</p>
<p>Earlier, First of America said it earned $51.0 million, or $0.84 a share, in the third quarter versus $66.7 million, or $1.05 a share, during the same period last year.  </p>
<p>This year's results included a $14.8 million, or $0.24 a share, charge to recapitalize the SAIF insurance fund.</p>
<p>Excluding the SAIF assessment, earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.08, up 2.9 percent from a year ago, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have experienced increases in revenue from targeted product areas, which has required emphasis and progress in sales. We are also working to become a more lean and efficient company,&quot; Chormann said.</p>
<p>The company said it has almost completed a balance sheet restructuring announced late last year.  </p>
<p>The bank holding company has reduced marginally profitable earning assets and deposits and expanded targeted loan portfolios and deposit products. It said this helped boost net interest margin to 4.59 percent for the third quarter from the 4.23 percent in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Our asset quality continues to be strong,&quot; Chormann said. &quot;During the third quarter, as a result of lower net charge-offs, improved credit quality of new loan originations and our stronger collection efforts, we were able to slightly reduce the provision for loan losses.  </p>
<p>Net charge-offs to average loans ratio, annualized, was 0.48 percent in the third quarter versus 0.49 percent for the second quarter, 0.52 percent for the first quarter and 0.63 for the fourth quarter of 1995, the company said.</p>
<p>Excluding the SAIF assessment, return on average assets would have been 1.20 percent for the third quarter of 1996, compared with 1.13 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>For the same comparable period, return on equity would have been 15.00 percent, compared with 15.17 percent.  The equity to asset ratio for the 1996 third quarter increased to 7.92 percent from 7.54 percent in 1995, First of America Bank said.</p>
