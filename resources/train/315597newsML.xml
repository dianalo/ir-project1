<p>British retail group Storehouse Plc, owners of Bhs and Mothercare stores, said on Friday sales rose nine percent in the six weeks to Christmas and the new year had got off to a good start.</p>
<p>&quot;Bhs had a successful Christmas...Mothercare was disappointing but trading since Christmas, especially the new childrenswear ranges, has been more encouraging,&quot; group chief executive Keith Edelman said.</p>
<p>Storehouse said group same-store sales were up 7.6 percent in the 40 weeks to January 4 and cumulative group sales were up 15 percent, including childrenswear and toy retailer Childrens World which Storehouse bought last May from Boots.</p>
<p>Investors hailed the retail figures, which contrasted sharply with some recent gloomy statements from stores after a predicted pre-Christmas shopping boom failed to materialise.</p>
<p>Storehouse shares soared almost eight percent, gaining 17 pence to 274-1/2 after a high of 278. Among other retailers, Blacks Leisure Group Plc gained six percent to a record 408p after the outdoor leisure group reported a 22 percent rise in same store sales for the 44 weeks to January 4.</p>
<p>&quot;After some recent disappointing Christmas sales statements from other high street chains, the market has certainly welcomed the Storehouse results,&quot; one senior dealer said.</p>
<p>Storehouse, created by Habitat founder Terence Conran, said total sales in the six weeks to Christmas were up 18 percent.</p>
<p>At Bhs sales rose almost 12 percent, boosted by strong gift and menswear sales and helped by the 25 million pound &quot;millennium&quot; revamp of Bhs stores which aims to revitalise shopfronts and interiors.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now clear that Bhs &quot;millennium&quot; store design can improve like-for-like sales and store profitability even at peak trading times...the sooner we can refit the whole chain the better,&quot; Edelman said.</p>
<p>Sales elsewhere were disappointing however in the Christmas period. Same-store sales at Mothercare were down four percent and Childrens World sales dropped two percent, chiefly because of lower toy sales, Storehouse said.</p>
<p>Edelman said consumers appeared to be targeting electronic toys at the expense of generic products. Toys account for a third of Childrens World sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Toy sales were softer and it probably has something to do with the electronic area. Computers were very strong, even the very early computers,&quot; Edelman said, referring to the toy computers aimed at very young children.</p>
<p>But Edelman was optimistic for both divisions, with Mothercare's new childrenswear range helping to set the retailer back on track.</p>
<p>&quot;We said that by the year-end (March 31) we expected Mothercare to be on a better trend and there are signs that could still be true,&quot; Edelman said.</p>
<p>The group is converting Childrens World's out-of-town sites into Mothercare World to reap efficiency gains.</p>
<p>&quot;We have improved margins at Mothercare and Bhs and managed in the first nine months to hold those margins. There is an opportunity for margin growth next year particularly in Childrens World when we convert them,&quot; he said.</p>
