<p>Dutch supermarkets group Ahold NV said on Tuesday its 1996 total sales had risen by 23.3 percent to 36.5 billion guilders.  </p>
<p>Sales growth in guilders was affected by the dollar exchange rate against the guilder, with an average 1.69 guilders for every dollar versus 1.61 in 1995. At unchanged exchange rates, sales would have grown by 20 percent, Ahold said.</p>
<p>The increase was mainly due to the contribution of American supermarket chain Stop &amp; Shop, acquired in July.</p>
<p>U.S. sales surged by 34.8 percent to $11.2 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Excluding the consolidation of Stop &amp; Shop, U.S. sales increased by 8.5 percent, Ahold said.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, sales rose 4.4 percent to 15.0 billion guilders.  </p>
<p>Dutch retail chain Albert Heijn increased sales by five percent while 73 percent Ahold-owned wholesaler Schuitema reported a 4.1 percent turnover growth.</p>
<p>In other European countries, sales totalled 2.5 billion guilders, 32.8 percent more than in 1995. This rise was mainly generated in Portugal but sales in the Czech Republic also showed strong growth. Turnover in Poland was still moderate.</p>
<p>In the Asia Pacific region, where Ahold recently became active in Singapore and Malaysia, 1996 sales totalled 57.6 million guilders.</p>
<p>No profit figures were given.  </p>
<p>Ahold president Cees van der Hoeven said in the statement last year's sales growth was the result of the company's international expansion strategy.</p>
<p>He repeated that further profitable growth could be expected from Ahold in the future.</p>
<p>On November 27, 1996, when Ahold released its third quarter results, the company said it expected net earnings in 1996, including Stop &amp; Shop, to be significantly higher than in 1995.</p>
