<p>Most Japanese stocks were higher in London on Friday, underpinned by strength in shares in major exporters and banks, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 1513 GMT, the Nikkei 50 was up 13.61 points at 1,413.51.</p>
<p>Shares in blue chip exporting concerns like Sony Corp and Toyota Motor Corp, firmed as the dollar appreciated against the Japanese yen, making Japanese exports more competitive on work markets.</p>
<p>The dollar rose as high as 122.12 against the yen in New York after the U.S. jobs data were released.</p>
<p>Dealers said most bank shares got a boost in London after Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd said it would dispose of 550 billion yen worth of problem loans. The bank made the announcement after Tokyo markets closed.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks have been under pressure in the last few months and now it looks like they're prepared to take measures to get their houses in order,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>He said he expected Japanese stocks to rise on Monday, led by shares in exporters, banks and property companies.</p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 average closed 157.41 points higher at 18,198.74, having dipped below the 18,000 level at one point in the session.</p>
<p>Dealers viewed the close above the 18,000 level as a bullish signal.</p>
