<p>Interfax news agency quoted a conservative agrarian politician as saying on Thursday that Russia's total grain harvest this year may be 12 to 15 million tonnes below official forecasts of 75-77 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the Agrarian Party faction in parliament, was quoted as saying the slow pace of harvesting in Siberia and a lack of farming equipment stood behind his grim forecast.</p>
<p>The Agrarians support a return of the farming sector to state control.</p>
<p>The State Statistics Committee (Goskomstat) said on Wednesday that as of Monday, Russia had gathered 58.2 million tonnes of grain, 4.2 million more than at the same date last year.</p>
<p>But farmers still have to harvest some 12.7 million hectares of grain including 10.7 million in the Siberian and Urals regions.</p>
<p>Kharitonov said that less than 10 percent of the total area sown to grain in Siberia had so far been harvested and each combine had to cover 350-400 hectares, or three times the optimal area.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted the Agriculture Ministry as saying that by Monday, farmers in Western Siberia had harvested 1.5 million tonnes against 3.2 million tonnes at the same date last year.</p>
<p>It said the grain harvest in Eastern Siberia was faring better and was so far at 487,000 tonnes compared to 417,000 tonnes in 1995. --Dmitry Solovyov, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520</p>
