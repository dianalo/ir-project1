<headline>Charges against Cowboys stars withdrawn-report.</headline>

<text>
<p>The woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted by Dallas Cowboys stars Michael Irvin and Erik Williams has now admitted she lied, radio reports quoted police as saying on Friday.</p>
<p>Dallas radio station KRLD cited police sources as saying the woman had withdrawn her allegations, and that police would formally announce the news shortly. Police officials were not immediately available for comment.  </p>
<p>Police spokesman Ed Spencer later told Reuters the 23-year-old woman had withdrawn her allegations, and that there was no case against Irvin or Williams.</p>
<p>&quot;We carried out a thorough and serious investigation and concluded the allegations were false,&quot; Spencer said.</p>
<p>The woman had accused Irvin of holding a gun against her head while Williams and a third, unidentified man raped her on top of a pool table inside Williams' home on Dec. 29. She said the men videotaped the assault.</p>
<p>But Irvin, 30, and Williams, 28, flatly denied the accusations. Irvin said he had not been at Williams' home in 18 months, and Williams insisted he had done nothing wrong.</p>
