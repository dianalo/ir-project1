<p>A government panel unveiled final proposals for reforming the law governing the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Thursday, aiming to boost the central bank's independence in forming its monetary policy and transparency in its decision-making process.</p>
<p>The proposals by the Financial System Research Council under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will become the basis for bills to be submitted to the current session of parliament to come into effect on April 1, 1998.  </p>
<p>The BOJ's main purpose is defined in the proposals as aiming to stabilise prices to help economic growth through steps such as adjustment of interest rates, the reserves requirement ratio for commercial banks and evaluation of the economic and financial situation.</p>
<p>It would also aim to maintain the credibility of the financial system through steps such as promoting smooth fund settlement among banks and inspection of financial institutions.</p>
<p>Under the proposals, the government's power to influence the BOJ's monetary policy decisions would be curbed.  </p>
<p>The government can at present order the BOJ to postpone monetary policy decisions should the central bank's views differ from those of the government. But under the plan, the government could only ask the BOJ's policy-making board to delay such decisions and the board could decide whether or not to agree to the request.</p>
<p>The plan, which aims to free the central bank from the grip of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), is part of deregulation promoted by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. MOF has come under fire for its handling of Japan's banking crisis and various embarrassing scandals involving its senior officials.</p>
