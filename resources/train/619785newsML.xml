<p>Hungary said on Wednesday the prospects were good that it would soon sign two World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements covering general purchases and information technology.</p>
<p>&quot;We will consider (signing the agreements) carefully and I think the prospects are good,&quot; Finance Ministry State Secretary Tibor Draskovits told Reuters.</p>
<p>The move would lift a potenital block on trade with the United States.</p>
<p>International Business Machine Corp officials said on Tuesday that Hungary's delay in signing the two accords hindered its Hungarian unit's exports to the U.S. as it could not sign deals wth the U.S. government.</p>
<p>&quot;For contracts with the U.S. government, those treaties are required,&quot; Walter Meizer, General Manager of Germany's IBM Speichersysteme GmbH said, adding that the U.S. only gives preferential treatment to those importers who have signed the WTO agreements.</p>
<p>Draskovits said Hungary was keen to be part of a freely trading world and as such would speed up the process towards reaching agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Since free trade is in our interest I think there is no real objection on the Hungarian side to being part of the agreement,&quot; he said, adding that he could not give a time-frame but Hungasry would act quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very fast-changing world so we have to hurry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Draskovits was speaking after IBM launched an initiative with the Hungarian government to boost small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Hungary.</p>
<p>IBM said earlier it had invested $100 million in Hungary since early 1995 and by the end of 1997 will have created over 3,500 jobs directly or through IBM projects.</p>
