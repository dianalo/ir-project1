<p>The Athens bourse defied the bears and rebounded by a strong 1.37 percent to make up about half of Thursday's 3.31 percent plunge in moderate volume of 6.06 billion drachmas.</p>
<p>It was the second normal session since a settlement scandal halted trading for almost four days, and brokers and analysts predicted that it would take time to repair the negative impact on market sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;We had signs of corruption with the recent crisis at the bourse -- you can't fool everyone all the time. We experienced light redemptions but such impacts take a longer time to be felt by mutual funds,&quot; said Phaedon Tamvakakis, managing director of Hambros Hellenic Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sources told Reuters the resignation of four of the five board members of the exchange's guarantee fund was imminent over a stock exchange draft bill released on Friday.</p>
<p>According to their interpretation the bill sets a loophole for the clearing house to avoid paying its part -- 1.3 billion drachmas -- of the Delta Securities default.</p>
<p>Banks gained 1.33 percent, industrials climbed 2.24 percent with construction edging uo 0.28 percent. Small-caps ended 1.65 percent higher.</p>
<p>Advancers led decliners 120 to 82 with 19 issues unchanged on 221 traded.</p>
