<text>
<p>French shares closed 1.6 percent lower on Thursday on profit-taking on the eve of the end of the trading account after recent highs for the blue-chip index, dealers said.</p>
<p>They added that rumours about unpublished opinion polls concerning the May 25 and June 1 two-round parliamentary election were also weighing on the market.</p>
<p>The French share market is expected to slip further on Friday when the May account closes and ahead of the weekend's first round of voting. The CAC-40 closed 44.70 points lower at 2,741.65.  </p>
<p>&quot;There should be further consolidation tomorrow, day of the liquidation (of the account) and eve of the election. We could go down to 2,700 or maybe even fall below it,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Volume was 8.29 billion francs of which 6.25 billion was in CAC-40 stocks. The May future was 44 points lower at 2,734.</p>
<p>* Elf Aquitaine gained 2.5 percent to 613 francs in the day's biggest individual volume of 1.5 billion francs after Renault sold an 0.9 percent stake in the oil group to an Elf subsidiary. Dealers said they expected the shares to be cancelled after a May 31 general meeting where Elf will ask permission to reduce its capital by up to 15 percent.  </p>
<p>* Seller Renault, which stands to make an asset gain of some 450 million francs on the deal, closed 4.34 percent down at 147.80 francs because dealers believe Elf is now due to sell its stake in the carmaker of less than three percent.</p>
<p>Elf had no comment on the rumour.</p>
<p>* Renault said after the close that it would sell engines and engine licences to Daewoo Corp of South Korea.</p>
<p>* Eurodisney was one of the biggest fallers of the day, down 4.89 percent at 8.75 francs, but dealers saw no particular reasons. It closed at a year low.  </p>
<p>* Total slipped slightly in heavy turnover, down 0.71 percent at 558 francs, after a recent good run on the general meeting and prospects for an Iran deal.</p>
