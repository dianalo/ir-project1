<p>Russia's parliament met on Friday in extraordinary session to scrutinise a decision by President Boris Yeltsin to withdraw Moscow's last troops from breakaway Chechnya.</p>
<p>But chances were slim that the session would lead to a head-on collision between the State Duma (lower chamber), dominated by the communist-led opposition, and Yeltsin, who is recovering after heart surgery.</p>
<p>Some deputies, saying the pullout from Chechnya amounts to acceptance of rebel demands for independence, were threatening to start impeachment moves against Yeltsin. Others said they wanted a no-confidence vote in the government.</p>
<p>But the communists who pushed for the debate have toned down their rhetoric and on Friday they appeared to be in disarray.</p>
<p>The start of the session was delayed by more than an hour while dozens of communists scrambled to find the cards which activate the electronic voting system.</p>
<p>Key figures in the Duma, including communist speaker Gennady Seleznyov and Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, sounded a more conciliatory tone ahead of the debate.</p>
<p>&quot;Legislators have some questions to ask the government,&quot; Itar-Tass news agency quoted Seleznyov as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;They cannot be pleased with the fact that the federal authorities are actually making unilateral concessions (to the Chechen rebels),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Just before the debate, Seleznyov told reporters that neither the issue of impeachment, nor of a no-confidence vote in the government was on the agenda.</p>
<p>The move seemed to reflect the fact that Yeltsin, re-elected in July, is in a much stronger position than the Duma.</p>
<p>Under the constitution, any impeachment bid would be a long drawn-out procedure which would have little chance of success.</p>
<p>Any move to bring the cabinet down would give Yeltsin the possibility of dismissing the Duma and calling early elections.</p>
<p>On Thursday Yeltsin sent a firm message to the Duma over who is in charge in Russia.</p>
<p>He defied opposition demands that he send Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to parliament to explain the withdrawal decision and an agreement which the premier signed last Saturday with the rebel Chechen government.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin on Friday defended Yeltsin's decision to withdraw Russia's remaining troops from the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Their withdrawal is an important step on the road to demilitarisation of the republic and the stabilisation of the regional atmosphere,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>But dissatisfaction with the deal, seen by many deputies as a sell-out of Russian national interests, remains strong.</p>
<p>A member of Chernomyrdin's own Our Home is Russia faction in the Duma urged the government to ensure elections in Chechnya, planned for January 27, be held under Moscow's auspices.</p>
<p>Sergei Belyayev, in remarks quoted by Interfax, also pressed the government to take a firm line on outstanding issues like the return of Russian soldiers held captive by the Chechens and the future of ethnic Russians in the region.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people, mainly civilians, have been killed in the Chechnya conflict since Yeltsin sent troops to try to crush the separatists in December 1994.</p>
<p>Fighting largely halted under a ceasefire last August but no solution has been found to the central dispute over Chechnya's status -- in or out of Russia.</p>
