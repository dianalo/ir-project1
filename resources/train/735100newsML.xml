<title>SOUTH AFRICA: FOSKOR AIMS TO SUPPLY ALUMINA TO ALUSAF.</title>

<p>South Africa's state-owned fertiliser producer Foskor is in talks with aluminium producer Alusaf Ltd to supply up to 20 percent of the alumina needs of Alusaf, an official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Foskor, a unit of the state's Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), has earmarked around 125.5 million rand for a demonstration plant which was being built at Foskor near Palaborwa on the edge of South Africa's Kruger National Park.</p>
<p>The project, which would cost around 4.1 billion rand, could produce 330,000 tonnes of alumina, 300,000 tonnes of magnesia and 230,000 tonnes of potassium sulphate per year from phlogopite supplied by Foskor and kaolinitic clay mined at a small mining operation near Bosbokrand.</p>
<p>IDC consultant Etienne Roux told Reuters Foskor and the IDC had been in contact with Alusaf.</p>
<p>&quot;They know all about the project. They will probably do most of the industrial-scale tests on the alumina for us.</p>
<p>&quot;The production of alumina from this project would satisfy something like 20 percent of Alusaf's needs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said there was no commitment for the project to supply the alumina to Alusaf and other options -- including supplying the alumina to niche markets -- were open.</p>
<p>Alusaf, a wholly-owned unit of Gencor Ltd and the largest aluminium smelter in the Western world produces around 500,000 tonnes of aluminium per year and currently imports all its alumina -- mostly from Billiton operations in Australia.</p>
<p>Roux said because the alumina would be extracted from the mineral phlogopite -- a silicate of aluminium, magnesium, potassium and iron -- it would be of very high quality.</p>
<p>Phlogopite was presently being discarded as tailings from Foskor's current phosphate operations.</p>
<p>He said the demonstration plant phase would last for two years during which an environmental impact study and feasibility study for a commercial plant will be completed.</p>
<p>The IDC said sufficient information would have been gathered by mid-1999 to complete a detailed feasibility study for the commercial project.</p>
<p>&quot;An investment decision could be reached in 2000 and the commercial project could be in production in 2002,&quot; the IDC said.</p>
<p>The IDC and Foskor said in May last year that they were to conduct a comprehensive environmental study into the project.</p>
<p>At the time the companies said the net benefits to South Africa in terms of foreign exchange savings and earnings would be more than 1.1 billion rand a year.</p>
