<title>GERMANY: Board recommends IG Bau reject construction deal.</title>
<headline>Board recommends IG Bau reject construction deal.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>The main wages commission of Germany's IG Bau construction union on Monday said it had recommended to union leadership that it reject an arbitration-brokered pay deal.</p>
<p>Despite pleas from government officials not to strike, the commission had been expected to reject the deal, which was approved by a small majority in the arbitration committee.</p>
<p>The union said it may resort to strikes to secure 100 percent sick-pay benefits for its workers, rejecting the decision of the arbitration committee for workers to receive 80 percent pay for the first three weeks of sickness.  </p>
<p>IG Bau leader Klaus Wiesenhuegel told a news conference in Frankfurt the union was prepared for further talks with employers and that it was prepared to compensate for sick pay costs in wage talks.</p>
<p>The decision made by the main wages commission on Monday will pass to the union's board for a final decision on whether to reject or accept the deal. If the deal is not approved by May 21, the IG Bau union can lawfully call industrial action.</p>
<p>Analysts believe any strike is likely to be limited since neither side can afford a prolonged dispute in a sector suffering from mass unemployment, with about 400,000 of its 1.3 million workers out of a job.</p>
<p>Officials from several regional units of the IG Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt (IG Bau) union signalled at the weekend that they were unhappy with the deal, which was reached last Thursday during a marathon negotiating session.</p>
<p>The controversial deal also recommended raising wages by 1.3 percent from last April 1 and reducing Christmas bonuses. German inflation stands at about 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>The IG Bau union had, among other demands, called for wage increase of 2.9 percent and continued full pay during annual sick leave while employers sought to keep pay unchanged.</p>
<p>Unoin officials particularly disliked the cutbacks in sick pay and the Christmas bonus. Government officials have urged the union and employers to accept the deal.</p>
<p>Construction minister Klaus Toepfer warned on Friday that a strike would be &quot;poison&quot; for the troubled sector. He noted that new building orders in Germany had fallen by 8.7 percent in January and February.</p>
<p>Labour minister Norbert Bluem also warned of the potentially devastating consequences for the sector of a strike in view of the current weakness in the construction industry.</p>
