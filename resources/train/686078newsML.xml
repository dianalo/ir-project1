<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday cancelled a two-day trip to Cambodia because of security concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;The secretary has decided not to travel to Phnom Penh on this trip,&quot; spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;After several days of consultations with Cambodian leaders and U.S. security experts she felt the security situation ... will not permit the type of visit she wants,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He briefed reporters on Albright's plane en route from San Francisco, where she gave a speech on Tuesday, to Hanoi, where she plans to meet government leaders on Friday. The aircraft was refueled at Elmendorf.</p>
<p>Burns called the Cambodia security environment &quot;serious and unpredictable&quot; as a result of recent political tensions that resulted in a firefight on June 17 between bodyguards loyal to the two rival co-prime ministers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen.</p>
<p>A rocket propelled grenade was lobbed into the U.S. embassy compound during the fighting. &quot;The conditions that produced the violence on June 17 continue to exist,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>Two bodyguards from Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and one bodyguard from co-Premier Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) were killed.</p>
<p>Ties between the two premiers, who have led a coalition government since 1993 elections, have sunk to a new low over Ranariddh's attempt to strike a deal with senior Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan and bolster his political position in the run-up to elections due next year.</p>
<p>The United States had taken a leadership role in forging the Cambodia peace deal that now appears to be disintegrating. Albright's visit was intended to press the country and its leaders to get back on the track toward democracy and free market economic reforms.</p>
<p>Despite Albright's decision not to go to Cambodia, a Japanese envoy and a European envoy were due to be in Phnom Penh on Wednesday to carry the G7 summit message that Cambodia should halt the political violence and tensions.</p>
<p>But Burns said the &quot;American secretary of state is different ... She's a much greater target&quot; for possible attacks.</p>
<p>He said Albright really wanted to visit Cambodia and explored a range of options -- including a very truncated stop of only a few hours -- to make it possible. But the bottom line is the United States decided it would have had to take extraordinary security precautions to ensure Albright's safety and that of her travelling party, officials said.</p>
<p>Security aides felt they could not rely on Cambodia's rival forces to do that job and there is no U.S. or other international military forces in the country to supplement the diplomatic security agents who are Albright's permanent bodyguards.</p>
<p>Albright plans to visit Asia again in three weeks for the Association of Southeast Asian Nation meeting in Kuala Lumpur and she could conceiveably stop in Cambodia then. But Burns said she currently &quot;has no plans to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>Albright planned to urge the political factions to end the political violence, continue efforts toward democracy and market reform and continue their efforts to bring notorious Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot to justice, Burns said.</p>
<p>He said the United States very much supported Cambodia's call for elections in May 1998. Also, Cambodia's leadership &quot;should redouble efforts to unify the government and pursue a peaceful path to elections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Albright had planned to visit Phnom Penh on June 27-29 as part of an Asian trip that includes Vietnam and Hong Kong for the June 30 handover of the British colony to Chinese control.</p>
<p>Now Burns said she would spend more time in Vietnam -- she is due to arrive in Hanoi on Thursday night -- and arrive in Hong Kong on Saturday June 28, a day earlier than planned.</p>
