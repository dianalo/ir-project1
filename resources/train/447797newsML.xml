<p>Western Resources Inc said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declared the registration statement for its exchange offer to shareholders of ADT Ltd effective.</p>
<p>The decision clears the way for Western Resources to deliver full details of its proposed $3.5 billion hostile takeover to ADT shareholders, Carl Koupal, a Western Resources spokesman told Reuters. ADT stockholders would receive $22.50 per share.  </p>
<p>&quot;We can and will now go directly to the shareholders of ADT to outline our offer,&quot; Koupal said. &quot;It's another important step in the process of moving toward getting the shareholders of ADT to act on our offer.&quot;</p>
<p>Under SEC rules, Western Resources had to receive formal approval from the SEC to send ADT shareholders documents containing full details of its proposed acquisition, Koupal said. He said the company would send the materials to the shareholders shortly, although he did not specify a date.  </p>
<p>In December, Western Resources, which already owns 27 percent of ADT, launched its hostile offer to buy the rest of the company in a deal that would make it the nation's top provider of electronic security services. At the time, the offer price consisted of $15 in Western Resources common stock and $7.50 in cash.</p>
<p>In January, however, ADT rejected the offer, prompting Western Resources to sweeten the deal to $10 in cash and $12.50 in its stock.  </p>
<p>ADT set a special July 8 shareholders meeting to consider the offer, although it said earlier this month it would recommend that its shareholders reject it. ADT said the offer was inadequate and did not reflect ADT's inherent value.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to hope for an earlier special meeting than July 8,&quot; Koupal said. &quot;We want to make it earlier and we have brought legal action against ADT in Florida to try to get that date moved up. We continue to press forward with that.&quot;  </p>
<p>Western Resources said it plans to conduct a special meeting of its own shareholders on April 24 to approve the acquisition. The company has also filed complaints in an attempt to invalidate ADT's anti-takeover -- or poison pill -- provisions.</p>
<p>When asked if Western Resources would again sweeten its offer if ADT shareholders rejected it, Koupal declined to comment. He said only, &quot;It's an offer we believe is of value to the (ADT) shareholders and we feel they have the right to be able to consider it as soon as possible.&quot;  </p>
<p>Koupal said it was notified of the SEC decision late Friday, although waited until Sunday evening to release the news.</p>
<p>&quot;We just wanted to put it out before the market opened on Monday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Western Resources shares closed Friday at 30-1/8. ADT shares closed at 21-3/4 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
