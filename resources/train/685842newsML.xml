<p>Chilean blue chips opened broadly higher with attention focused on the launch of Luksic group holding company Quinenco in Santiago and New York, said traders.</p>
<p>Traders reported high interest among local and foreign investors in the firm, which will be Chile's twenty-first company to trade publicly on Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;People are betting on Quinenco as a vehicle for the growth of the Luksic group,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Nearly 29 million Quinenco shares were sold at the minimum price of 750.96 pesos per share in a stock offering Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The 40-share  .IPSA index opened up 0.16 percent at 132.67 points.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market reacted with mild relief to news that the government had finally set new electricity distribution prices after winning a court battle against power companies over the rates.</p>
<p>A notice in the government gazette Wednesday announced sharp price cuts, including a 12 percent reduction for Chile's largest power distributor Chilectra.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the electricity rates are a big surprise -- on the contrary, it's positive to get them out of the way,&quot; said David Hurd, head of research at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Power generator Chilgener stock is expected to be volatile over the next couple of months as the company has recently started selling preferential shares in its $500 million rights issue. ((-- Margaret Orgill, Santiago newsroom, 562-699-5595 x212))</p>
