<p>Romania's main car makers and importers on Tuesday slammed the transport ministry's decision to levy a road tax on motorists, saying it could push local car production and sales to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;This move hurts seriously the interests of car producers, importers or users,&quot; Paul Schiaucu, head of the Association of Automotive Manufacturers and Importers (APIA), told a news conference.</p>
<p>On Monday the ministry said it would amend a 1996 bill -- which already levies a 10 percent tax on the purchase price of new cars -- and bring in a supplementary road tax in order to create a fund to repair the country's battered roads.</p>
<p>&quot;The extra burden brought by the new taxes is extremely discouraging for all car buyers and threatens producers,&quot; said Dan Vardie, vice-president of APIA, which groups the local Dacia Automobile SA and Daewoo Automobile Craiova car makers.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, vehicles with a capacity of up to 1,500 cubic centimetres would be taxed with 50,000 lei a year.</p>
<p>Capacities from 1,500 to 2,000 cc would be taxed with 100,000 lei, while taxes for vehicles with capacities exceeding 2,000 cc would amount to 1.4 million lei.</p>
<p>Romania has some 2.94 registered vehicles of various capacities, APIA data show.</p>
<p>Since the bill was enforced last November, car sales had dropped dramatically in Romania, Vardie said.</p>
<p>Data showed sales for imported and locally-made cars had dropped by 40 percent since January.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't grasp the logic behind these taxes,&quot; said Marius Pitigoi, head of the Autorom SA, the sole authorised Mercedes dealer in Romania.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like someone just played with figures without thinking that any potential buyer already has to pay huge amounts to get a car,&quot; Pitigoi said.</p>
<p>The ministry planned to put an estimated 2.5 trillion lei to be grossed from the road taxes into a special fund to finance part of the repairs needed by Romania's roads. Some 70 percent of the country's 14,500 km (9,000 miles) of roads are in bad shape.</p>
