<p>German shares ended bourse trade on Monday lower, hurt by profit taking after the DAX index on Friday surged to a new all-time high on buying tied to the expiry of DAX futures and options and stock options.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX ended the session down 33.55 points at 3,754.72 points and near the session low of 3,751.23 points.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX, which reflects all-day computer trade, later ended down 39.75 points, or 1.05 percent, at 3,748.79 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything seems to be going against the DAX right now,&quot; said one Frankfurt trader. &quot;Everyone had their mind on the expiry last Friday and it's been very quiet today. There's no reason for the rally to continue right now.&quot;</p>
<p>A slightly weaker dollar and German debt market losses also capped enthusiasm for buying as traders predicted further range trade with a downside bias.</p>
<p>The DAX index should find support at 3,750 points on any more selling, with further support evident at 3,740 points.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a big expiry on Friday and the market is trying to find its feet,&quot; said another Frankfurt share trader.</p>
<p>But some traders said the dollar's ongoing stability above 1.70 marks was supportive and would underpin export-sensitive shares, particularly in the chemical and carmaker industries.</p>
<p>Among specific shares, television network ProSieben was in the spotlight as its shares surged in grey market dealings.</p>
<p>ProSieben, the first television network in Germany to go public, set its bookbuilding price range for an initial offering of preference shares at 66 to 72 marks per share.</p>
<p>Traders said grey market bids for the shares were quickly indicated at 100 marks before slipping to about 95 marks.</p>
<p>Telephone group Deutsche Telekom ended up 50 pfennigs at 43.15 marks after it denied a report that it planned to dismiss board member Herbert May after talks over allowing other telecoms firms access to Deutsche's network broke down.</p>
<p>May is responsible for business clients at Telekom.</p>
<p>One German brokerage house said pharmaceuticals group Bayer AG, industrial group Daimler-Benz AG and electronics group Siemens AG were in favour due to technical factors.</p>
<p>Siemens rose 1.55 marks to 103.20 marks in bourse trade but Bayer ended down 1.21 marks at 68.45 marks and Daimler was down 60 pfennigs at 136.40 marks.</p>
