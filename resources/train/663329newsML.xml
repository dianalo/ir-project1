<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian govt members support tax reform.</title>

<p>A campaign to overhaul the Australian taxation system was launched on Monday when junior members of the conservative government gave their overwhelming support for Prime Minister John Howard's reform plans.</p>
<p>But proposed changes remained broad and backbenchers had not considered specific options such as a consumption tax in any depth during a late night meeting with Liberal-National coalition leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;The coalition parties expressed a genuine desire for tax reform, very strong support for general tax reform and gave a steer to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet about the way in which the issue should be progressed,&quot; Treasurer Peter Costello told reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>He said backbenchers were aware of the inconsistencies of the tax system and believed that any reforms should be aimed at boosting the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a very strong view that tax reform has got to be focused on increasing exports and developing jobs,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard last month said there was a need for a debate on the tax system and revamped the push for a controversial goods and services tax (GST) that many blame for delaying the coalition's return to power.</p>
<p>The coalition -- which lost what was regarded as an unloseable election in 1993 with a policy for a GST -- pledged in the 1996 election not to introduce a consumption tax in its first three-year term.</p>
<p>But a series of recent opinion polls have showed growing community support for a GST and Howard has not ruled out its introduction in the second term of government.</p>
<p>Backbenchers said some parliamentarians remained concerned about the impacts of a GST policy at the next election, although the majority seemed to support it.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd say there was a number of people who still have the experience of 1993 fresh in their minds,&quot; backbencher Ross Cameron told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's strong opposition to a GST per se, but there are serious questions about how we enrol the community in that discussion.&quot;</p>
<p>Costello said government members were encouraged to seek community opinion on the issue and report back to the government before the next step was taken.</p>
