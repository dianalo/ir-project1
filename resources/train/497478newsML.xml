<p>Polish anti-smoking campaigners on Wednesday sounded the alarm over a bid in parliament this week to scrap part of a new law forcing cigarette packs to carry bigger health warnings than in other European states.</p>
<p>Under a tough law passed in late 1995 to limit the health damage caused by tobacco, cigarette packs sold in Poland after the end of this year will have to carry stark health warnings covering at least 30 percent of each large side of a pack.</p>
<p>This week parliament is to to vote on an amendment which would reverse this requirement even before it takes effect, arguing the law would discriminate against local products.</p>
<p>The authors of the amendment say that, as Poland's European Union neighbours such as Germany only require a small warning covering four percent of each pack, foreign-made cigarettes will have an unfair advantage on the Polish market.</p>
<p>The draft also argues that the large health warnings will prevent a proper display of each firm's brand name and symbol.</p>
<p>&quot;This provision places the Polish tobacco industry in a very difficult position,&quot; reads the document backing the amendment, which was approved by a parliamentary committee dominated by the ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) party.</p>
<p>But opposition deputy Grzegorz Marciniak said the argument that sales of Polish-made brands would suffer more than imported ones was false, because the requirement for the large warning applied to domestic and imported cigarettes alike.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to say that I am ashamed of my parliamentary colleagues...the justification is false,&quot; the strong opponent of tobacco told a news conference.</p>
<p>Poland's leading anti-smoking crusader, cancer specialist Witold Zatonski, said tobacco firms in Poland and abroad were afraid Poland's tough example would be copied in EU countries and had lobbied hard to halt it now -- persuading some deputies who voted for the original law to change their minds.</p>
<p>&quot;Our law on health warnings is a precedent in Europe and if it is not changed it could quickly spread to other European states,&quot; Zatonski told the conference.</p>
<p>Poles are among the world's heaviest smokers and the tobacco industry, privatised last year, has attracted heavy foreign investment, but health campaigns and rising duties on tobacco have brought a drop in demand.</p>
<p>Last year about 90 billion cigarettes were sold in Poland, down from 96 billion the previous year.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Zatonski said that every day 500 children in Poland began to smoke and children consumed three to four billion cigarettes a year.</p>
<p>The 1995 law, passed almost unanimously, also introduced restrictions on tobacco advertising but not a total ban.</p>
