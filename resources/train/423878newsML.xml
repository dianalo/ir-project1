<p>Starbucks Coffee Corp has not lived up to promises to monitor treatment of workers on Guatemalan farms that supply coffee to the Seattle, Wash., company, a labour group said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But an executive of Starbucks, a speciality retailer that purchases a small percentage of Guatemalan coffee, said the company consistently has worked in small ways to promote change in this Central American nation.  </p>
<p>&quot;Starbucks has refused to take steps to identify let alone monitor the growers of its Guatemalan coffee,&quot; the U.S./Guatemala Labour Education Project (GLEP) said in a news release.</p>
<p>GLEP held a news conference in Seattle on Wednesday, the day before Starbuck's annual shareholders meeting, to announce a campaign to pressure Starbucks to implement its code.</p>
<p>GLEP said it recently conducted interviews with workers on a Guatemalan plantation from which Starbucks has purchased coffee for several years.  </p>
<p>Workers told GLEP they earned $1.25 a day for the work of an entire family, which needs $8-$9 to meet basic needs, GLEP said.  It said it documented other abuses including child labour, no protection for workers using pesticides, not enough latrines for workers, and housing made of plastic sheeting and sticks.</p>
<p>&quot;Starbucks is a small company that is expected by some people to do far more than we could ever realistically hope to achieve. Instead we are trying to do our part ... in projects that have a future capability,&quot; Dave Olsen, Starbuck's senior vice president for coffee, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Starbucks has more than 1,100 speciality coffee shops and cafes in the United States.</p>
<p>Starbucks in 1995 announced it would adopt a code of conduct looking for ways to work toward higher coffee quality, better quality of life for people in coffee production, and better environmental quality for coffee-related activities.</p>
<p>Part of its goal was to purchase coffee from growers who share a commitment to good wages, decent housing and acceptable health and safety standards.  </p>
<p>Olsen said Starbucks announced last week a joint programme with Appropriate Technology International to increase the income of small coffee farms in Guatemala.</p>
<p>Olsen said the project for growers of less than 10 acres would provide agricultural knowledge to improve coffee yields, help small growers get loans and provide better market access.</p>
