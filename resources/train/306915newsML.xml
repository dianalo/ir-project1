<p>Peugeot Automobiles, the biggest manufacturing branch of the PSA Peugeot Citroen group, said on Tuesday that sales of its cars and light commercial vehicles rose 4.6 percent last year to 1.17 million units.</p>
<p>It sold 995,000 vehicles in the 17 countries making up western Europe, up 4.9 percent from 1995 levels, and 178,600 vehicles in the rest of the world, up 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>Peugeot car sales rose 7.6 percent in France to 367,700 and 3.7 percent in the rest of western Europe. Peugeot deputy managing director Frederic Saint-Geours told reporters he hoped to increase car sales in Europe by seven percent this year.</p>
<p>Peugeot had difficulties in Germany last year because of a delay in renewing the contract with its German dealers and slower-than-hoped sales of the new 406 model, Saint-Geours said.</p>
<p>Peugeot's share of the German car market slipped to 2.4 percent last year from 2.6 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>He said the company sent a revised contract to its German dealers at the end of 1996. &quot;We hope to sort out this situation in the next two to three months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Peugeot aims to boost its share of the German market to 2.9 or three percent this year, helped by sales of new versions of the 406, including a stationwagon.</p>
<p>Its market share rose in Spain and Britain last year, but fell in Italy where it sacrificed volumes to protect margins.</p>
<p>In France, Peugeot's share of the car market slipped to 17.2 percent last year from 17.7 percent in 1995, but Saint-Geours said the group aimed to take more than 18 percent in 1997 and was counting on a boost from the launch of a revamped 306 car.</p>
<p>He said a reversal in the falling share of diesel cars, which hit a low of 37 percent in France in the third quarter of 1996 but has risen since, was favourable for Peugeot. The share of diesel car sales was 40 percent in the fourth quarter and 44.8 percent in December.</p>
<p>Saint-Geours said the PSA group maintained its objective to raise the proportion of sales outside western Europe to 25 percent by the year 2000, although its efforts last year were slowed by difficulties in China and Brazil.</p>
<p>Peugeot sales in China fell to 3,000 last year from 8,000. The drop partly reflected a fall of more than 10 percent in Chinese car sales due to a liquidity crunch in China, but also tensions at its Guangzhou joint venture, which is currently not producing cars. Saint-Geours reiterated that the group was studying several options, including shifting Peugeot production to the Citroen plant in Wuhan, but had taken no decision.</p>
<p>The PSA group has been in talks for several months to set up production in Brazil, and Saint-Geours said an agreement was expected in 1997, probably early in the year.</p>
<p>He said Peugeot exports to Brazil were hit last year by a surge in Brazilian duties on imported cars.</p>
<p>Peugeot delivered 8,000 kits to assemble 405 models last year to its Iranian partner Iran Khodro after resuming shipments following the settlement of Iranian arrears. Saint-Geours said financing was in place for the delivery of 10,000 kits this year, and demand for cars in Iran appeared to be strong.</p>
