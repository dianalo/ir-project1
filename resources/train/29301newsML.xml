<p>Poland's biggest opposition party on Tuesday accused the ruling leftist coalition of trying to grab control of public television, the country's main source of news, and use it in the campaign for elections next year.</p>
<p>Last week's sacking of the chief of one of television's two channels was a further sign the coalition aimed to steer programmes during the parliamentary election campaign, said Andrzej Potocki, spokesman for the Union for Freedom (UW).</p>
<p>&quot;The electoral campaign is coming closer and the coalition wants to subordinate public television to itself,&quot; Potocki told Reuters.</p>
<p>A dominant group in television management, linked to the two ruling coalition parties of ex-communists and Peasants, fired First Channel director Tomasz Siemoniak on Friday -- prompting nine senior editors to quit in solidarity.</p>
<p>Siemoniak said he had been fired by political appointees and alleged: &quot;They want to root out all programmes which do not fall in with the political views of their protectors.&quot;</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz firmly denied on Tuesday any attempts to influence the television.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has not, does not and will not exert any pressure on internal decisions in the television,&quot; PAP news agency quoted Cimoszewicz as telling reporters.</p>
<p>The head of the television has said the sacking was merely over Siemoniak's failure to carry out agreed guidelines.</p>
<p>The latest uproar is part of a sequence that has already aroused concern in Washington and other Western countries over public television -- seen as a vital element in a democracy only established with the 1989 fall of communism.</p>
<p>In February, after President Lech Walesa's defeat last year removed a counterweight to the ruling left, the right-leaning head of the television Wieslaw Walendziak quit, alleging pressure from the two parties rooted in the communist era.</p>
<p>His successor, Peasant party member Ryszard Miazek, was then quoted as making remarks about the role of journalists which prompted anxious enquiries from senior U.S. officials concerned over democratic progress in a country seeking NATO membership.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati returned from talks in Washington saying: &quot;I heard concerns that the new television leadership might conduct a purge of staff.&quot;</p>
<p>Miazek said at the time that he had been misquoted.</p>
<p>Since then, however, some hard-hitting current affairs programmes associated with the former management have been scrapped and, last month, the management aroused a storm by deciding not to take programmes made by outside companies.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that people who are not associated with the current coalition will now be systematically eliminated,&quot; Potocki said. &quot;The implications of such a move would be the disappearance of objectivity and an independent television.</p>
<p>His concerns were echoed by Marek Jurek -- a former right-wing politician who is now a member of the National Radio and Television Council (KRRiT), the broadcasting watchdog.</p>
<p>Jurek called for the cancelled programmes to be restored.</p>
<p>KRRiT was meeting on Tuesday to discuss the situation in the television.</p>
