<p>Six Mexicans trying to cross the border illegally into the United States got trapped in an irrigation ditch during a violent rainstorm and drowned, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>U.S. Border Patrol agents were looking for a seventh body, believed to be that of a child. One of the dead, a woman in her 20s or 30s, was found with a diaper bag, leading authorities to believe a child was involved in the crossing attempt on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>According to Rob Daniels, spokesman for the Border Patrol's Tucson sector, Mexican authorities told U.S. police on Tuesday that 13 immigrants tried unsuccessfully to cross into Douglas along a ditch that runs under an official border-crossing point and that six of them had returned to Mexico.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, city workers trying to clear debris from the ditch as a result of the storm early on Wednesday found the body of a man. Police searching the area found four more bodies about six hours later, including that of a woman.</p>
<p>&quot;At that point the Border Patrol was asked to search the entire area and drainage system,&quot; said Daniels. They soon found the sixth body, also a man. All victims were in their 20s and 30s, Daniels said. One was identified as a 35-year-old man from Quinta Moralos, Mexico.</p>
<p>The area in southeast Arizona, which usually gets no more than 10 inches (25 cm) of rain a year, was soaked with three inches (7.5 cm) in a single hour on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;It is believed they were swept away and drowned as a result of the sudden onslaught of running water,&quot; said Daniels. &quot;It's not uncommon that when these storms come up these dry river beds suddenly become roaring rapids. Runoff has little or no place to go.&quot;</p>
