<p>Fifty-six percent of British managers believe it is time for a change of government, according to a survey by the Institute of Management.</p>
<p>A poll of 366 of its members during the week of the ruling Conservative Party's annual conference last week found that 44 percent thought the party was out of touch with the real needs of business.</p>
<p>Around three quarters thought government policies on Europe had weakened Britain's position in the EU and that adoption of a &quot;Euro-sceptic&quot; agenda would damage British business.</p>
<p>&quot;Managers believe the Tories -- traditionally the party of enterprise -- have lost touch with British business,&quot; Institute of Management director-general Roger Young said.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe is key to Britain's long-term propserity and managers are concerned that the Conservatives' approach to Europe is damaging the UK's interests.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The government must heed the long-term needs of business rather than the short-term demands of party unity if it is to secure managers' confidence once again.&quot;</p>
