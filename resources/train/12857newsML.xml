<p>Mother Teresa's fever has fallen and her malaria is under control, but the Roman Catholic missionary remains in serious condition with an unstable heart, a doctor said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;It (her condition) is still serious,&quot; Dr S.K. Sen, medical director of Woodlands Nursing Home, told reporters in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta. &quot;Her condition is still unchanged. She is conscious. Her cardiac condition remains unstable.&quot;  </p>
<p>Earlier, local news agencies quoting unnamed authorities said the condition of the world-renowned nun had improved on Saturday and she was in stable condition.</p>
<p>Sen said doctors had been able to contain the malaria, and her fever had fallen to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 Celsius) from 100 degrees (37.8 Celsius). The doctor said there had been no significant complications on Saturday.</p>
<p>A medical bulletin released by the hospital said Mother Teresa, 85, was being treated with antibiotics for a chest infection.</p>
<p>&quot;She continues to have respiratory support,&quot; Sen said. &quot;She is showing enormous strength given her age, which has surprised all of us. She is not able to speak. She is just making gestures. We are keeping strict vigilance around the clock.&quot;</p>
