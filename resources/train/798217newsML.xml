<p>Belgian linear bonds headed languidly lower in morning trading on Wednesday, tracking German Bunds and with attention focused on a flush of forthcoming figures from the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a tired and offered market,&quot; one trader said, noting pressure on short maturity paper and buying of long paper producing a yield curve flattening move.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is doing well on the short end. This market is due for a larger correction downwards,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;There are very important U.S. figures today and Thursday. They will set the tone for the rest of the week,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>U.S. July retail sales and producer prices are due this afternoon. They are seen rising 0.7 percent and 0.1 percent respectively.</p>
<p>On Thursday July consumer prices and June industrial production figures feature among a host of other data.</p>
<p>Traders said the prospect of these figures was keeping the Belgian bond market relatively quiet on Wednesday, as was the mild upward pressure on money market rates and currency worries.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT the yield of the benchmark 10 year OLO was 5.78 percent against Tuesday's closing 5.74 percent. The spread over Bunds was an unchanged nine basis points.  </p>
<p>The front month futures contract was 29 basis points off at 121.00.</p>
<p>The one-week repo rate was 3.31/36 percent against late Tuesday's 3.28/31, and the mark/franc was 20.6505/15 against 20.6465/95.</p>
