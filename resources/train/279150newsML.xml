<headline>Oman's Sultan decrees defence council membership.</headline>
<dateline>MUSCAT 1996-12-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said on Saturday issued a decree detailing the role and composition the Sultanate's defence council announced in November.</p>
<p>The council, to be headed by the Sultan himself, &quot;will look into issues of state security and defence, and will confirm the successor which the Sultan will recommend in a letter to the ruling family, if the family fails to agree on a successor when the post of the Sultan becomes vacant,&quot; the decree said.</p>
<p>It said army, airforce, police, and customs chiefs would be members of the defence council. The Sultan's palace minister and the army chief of staff would also serve on the council.</p>
<p>Sultan Qaboos in November decreed Oman's &quot;basic law&quot;, which diplomats said was the country's first written constitution.</p>
<p>They said the law was aimed at preventing a power vaccum or an internal struggle after his death.</p>
<p>The Sultan, 56, has had no heir apparent since he took over from his father in 1970. He is not married.</p>
<p>Oman, with a population of over two million, is a small independent oil producer and a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council which also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
