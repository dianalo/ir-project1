<title>USA: Immunex up on Flt, SmithKline news.</title>
<headline>Immunex up on Flt, SmithKline news.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-06-24</dateline>

<p>Shares of the biotechnology company Immunex Corp rose sharply Tuesday on positive news from one of its own drug development projects, and bad news from a competitor, analysts said.</p>
<p>The news from Immunex was that its Flt 3 ligand compound was shown to boost the immune system dramatically, suggesting potential as a treatment for cancer and infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, SmithKline Beecham Plc said it had suspended trials of a compound for rheumatoid arthritis, a disorder for which Immunex is also working on a treatment.</p>
<p>Immunex shares were up 5-3/16 to 35-7/16.  </p>
<p>SmithKline and Immunex are two among a group of companies working on a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. On Tuesday, SmithKline and its U.S. partner, IDEC Pharmaceutical Corp said they had suspended Phase III trials of the compound they were jointly developing after observing lowered immune cell counts in patients who had been treated with it.</p>
<p>Analysts noted SmithKline and IDEC do have a follow-up drug in earlier-stage trials, but said Immunex shares had clearly benefited from the setback.</p>
<p>They also said Immunex's Flt 3 ligand was increasingly showing potential in a broad range of applications, including as an adjuvant to so-called cancer vaccines.</p>
<p>Immunex said Tuesday that Flt 3 ligand produced an average 30-fold increase in one type of immune system cell, which is central to anti-tumor and infectious disease immunotherapy.</p>
<p>&quot;It is showing promise as a vaccine adjuvant, anticancer agent and as a stimulator of bone marrow cells,&quot; said Josephthal Lyon analyst Franklin Berger.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with the next generation of cancer vaccines is that they don't rev up the immune system sufficiently. A vaccine adjuvant is a was of turning up the immune system to make it more responsive to a vaccine,&quot; Berger said.</p>
