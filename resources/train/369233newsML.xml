<p>The zloty broke a key resistance level against the basket of currencies at three percent from the parity rate after foreign payments for Polish fixed bonds created a currency selling trend despite a bullish dollar.</p>
<p>They said the supply of currencies was higher than demand for them on the local forex market, which remained mainly focused on domestic pressures and not the volatile dollar/mark trade on world markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Supply of currencies on the local market dominated contrary to the world market and selling trend efficiently underpinned the zloty,&quot; said Adam Roeske from Bank Gdanski SA.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed at 3.22/3.14 percent from the trading band centre, stronger than Monday's clodse at 2.97/2.92 percent. It closed at 3.0110/30 to the dollar, down from 3.0033/48 on Monday and at 1.7995/15 to the mark, up from 1.8155/65.</p>
<p>Dealers were surprised the central bank did not intervene against the zloty at three percent from parity as expected and said that this opened the way for another test at 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The cost of carry-over currency positions is high, so I expect the pro-zloty sentiment pushing the zloty to the next intervention level possibly at 3.5 percent,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Longer-term money market deposits were virtually unchanged, while shorter depos eased slightly as the recent underliquidity was seen fading later this week after cash inflows revamp the slightly dry market.</p>
<p>&quot;Shorter term rates tend to trade lower and they may ease to around 22 percent later this week,&quot; one dealer at a foreign bank here said.</p>
<p>Overnight deposit rates were at 22.10/22.25 percent against the opening's 22.35/22.55 percent. Tomorrow/next rates were at 22.30/22.75 percent from opening's 22.30/22.55 percent.</p>
