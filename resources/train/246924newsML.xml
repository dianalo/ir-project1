<p>A British-based mine-clearance agency on Tuesday launched a novel mechanical process to help speed up the destruction of mines in the war-torn Afghan capital.</p>
<p>&quot;We started today with mechanical clearance,&quot; team leader of the Halo Trust, Khalil Hamayoun, told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For four years, Kabul was on the front line between warring Afghan factions and the city is strewn with mines and unexploded ordinance. The city is now under control of the Islamic fundamentalist Taleban militia.</p>
<p>Mines are normally cleared by hand. A two-man team, one with a metal detector and another with a probe, painstakingly investigate any trace of metal.</p>
<p>Mines in Kabul are frequently buried up to a metre deep -- beyond the range of the metal detector -- by walls and buildings that have collapsed in the fighting.</p>
<p>Halo's new armoured mechanical digger is designed to speed up operations. &quot;We expect that we will be able to clear in one day what would have taken a two-man team two or three weeks,&quot; said Jasper Harrison, a member of the Halo team.</p>
<p>Halo is using a modified Soviet-built digger to clear a minefield in one of the most fought-over parts of Kabul.</p>
<p>The digger has an armoured bucket and cabin.</p>
<p>&quot;We took some armour from a destroyed armoured personnel carrier and welded it on to the cabin and the bucket. The windows are made of armoured glass,&quot; said Hamayoun.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been testing the digger for the last month. Last week I detonated two mines in the bucket while I was in the cabin. There was no problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The digger scoops up the debris and then spreads it thinly on a hard surface so that any mines or unexploded munitions can be spotted and destroyed.</p>
<p>The United Nations says there are an estimated 10 million mines in Afghanistan and that between 20 and 25 people are wounded each day. It says 400,000 Afghans have been maimed by landmines.</p>
