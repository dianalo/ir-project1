<p>Leading Edge Packagaing Inc chief financial officer Casey Tjang said Tuesday that he expects the company to report earnings of between $1.9 million and $2.1 million, or $0.85 to $0.90 per share, in the fiscal year ended March 31.</p>
<p>Tjang also said that revenues for the company would be between $12 million and $13 million for the year.</p>
<p>Leading Edge went public last year, spun off from a unit of Chung Hwa  Development Holdings Ltd.  On a proforma basis, earnings for the preceding fiscal year were $0.52 per share.</p>
<p>Tjang also said that he expects the company, which makes gift boxes for jewelry and other items, to increase its market share to about 20 percent of the market for such items by 2001.</p>
<p>That would indicate revenues of about $80 million, he said, which he beleives the company can attain by finding new customers among smaller jewelry chains in the Texas and the Midwest, expanding into existing distributorships and developiong the market for premium items, such as cases for NFL licensed watches or car keys.</p>
