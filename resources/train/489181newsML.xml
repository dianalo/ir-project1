<p>The opposition bloc that returned radical Zaire politician Etienne Tshisekedi to power this week joined rivals on Saturday to try and oust the prime minister.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi has drawn fire from political opponents as well as his own backers in parliament by deciding to dissolve the legislature and appoint ministers by decree.</p>
<p>The pro-Tshisekedi Sacred Union opposition alliance and the Presidential Movement grouping President Mobutu Sese Seko's allies said jointly they no longer had confidence in Tshisekedi.</p>
<p>&quot;The two political families have decided to withdraw their confidence in Etienne Tshisekedi as Prime Minister,&quot; a joint statement said after a meeting of leaders of the two sides.</p>
<p>A Sacred Union spokesman said earlier the Alliance endorsed steps to remove Tshisekedi from office begun earlier by the Presidential Movement which dominates parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The opposition alliance upholds the accusations made by the presidential movement and takes note of the charges brought against the prime minister Mr Etienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba,&quot; spokesman Alexei Likango declared after an Alliance meeting.</p>
<p>This meant members of a committee of opposition deputies assembled at parliament on Saturday had withdrawn support for Tshisekedi only days after he took office, lawmakers said.</p>
<p>However a complicated constitutional procedure to dismiss Tshisekedi may take up to two weeks, they added.</p>
<p>The meeting was held up for several hours by a group of about 50 pro-Tshisekedi demonstrators who carried placards declaring support for the prime minister. Civil guardsmen dispersed them peacefully but not before they had frightened off organisers of the meeting.</p>
<p>Later militant Tshisekedi supporters grouped together as they do daily in the capital's working class district of Matonge said they would continue to block parliament should procedures to dismiss their man continue.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi was named prime minister by an overwhelming majority of opposition parties last Monday. Mobutu, who sacked him from the same job in 1993, then ratified the nomination of his arch-rival.</p>
<p>Mobutu's supporters initiated moves to remove Tshisekedi soon after he announced the controversial policy moves on his first day on the job on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Mobutu camp was completely excluded from the government unveiled by Tshisekedi the same day, as were opposition parties not affiliated to Tshisekedi's UDPS party.</p>
