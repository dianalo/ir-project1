<p>Even before he has had a chance to savor his re-election, President Bill Clinton is knee-deep in foreign policy problems in Africa and Bosnia -- and this might be an omen of things to come.</p>
<p>At a time when he is trying to choose a team for his second term and prepare for an Asian trip starting on Friday, Clinton has been distracted by pressure to send U.S. troops to help ease Zaire's refugee crisis and continue the NATO-led peacekeeping operation in the Balkans.</p>
<p>He agreed in principle to the former on Wednesday -- subject to a set of stringent conditions -- and is clearly in favour of the latter. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said on Thursday the United States was ready to commit as many as 8,000 troops to a new international force of up to 30,000 that would police the peace in Bosnia next year.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said the need for immediate presidential action on these issues had slowed the process of putting together a new foreign policy team, which Clinton originally hoped to finish before he left on his 12-day trip.</p>
<p>But Helmut Sonnenfeldt, an international affairs expert who served in President Richard Nixon's administration, said Clinton and his advisers had only themselves to blame.</p>
<p>&quot;They kicked a lot of cans down the road to deal with after the (Nov. 5) election. Zaire has been a mess for a while ... and everbody knew what has been accomplished in Bosnia is very fragile, and that there would have to be a continued military mission of some sort,&quot; Sonnenfeldt said.</p>
<p>But Zaire and Bosnia are just leading indicators of the likely prominence of foreign policy in Clinton's presidency over the next four years. White House insiders see a host of potential problems ranging from rising tensions on the Korean peninsula to Russia's sensitivity over enlargement of NATO.</p>
<p>Shaky U.S. relations with China, an issue Clinton intends to address at a meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the Asian trade summit in Manila next week, is yet another big item on Clinton's second term agenda.</p>
<p>And looming over all else on the foreign policy front is the precarious state of the Middle East peace process. U.S. officials believe agreement is imminent on an Israeli troop pullout from Hebron, the last West Bank city under Israeli military rule, but they see many more hurdles ahead.</p>
<p>It is ironic that foreign policy has become so big a part of the workload for Clinton, a Democrat who came into office in 1993 planning a single-minded focus on domestic policy.</p>
<p>Stephen Hess, a scholar of the presidency based at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, said Clinton's focus on international affairs was likely to become more and more pronounced as his second term unfolded. &quot;There's an old cliche that when presidents cannot run for another term they run for the Nobel Peace Prize. They certainly run for their place in history.&quot;</p>
<p>Hess said it was also &quot;easier and neater&quot; for an American president -- particularly a second-term political lame duck like Clinton -- to deal with foreign policy, &quot;where he has power and elbow room,&quot; than it was to wrestle with an opposition-controlled Congress over thorny domestic issues.</p>
