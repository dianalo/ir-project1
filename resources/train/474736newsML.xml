<p>Australia is holding a planeload of military hardware bound for Papua New Guinea, where plans to use mercenaries to quell a rebellion sparked a 10-day national crisis, an Australian official said on Friday.</p>
<p>An Antonov 124 carrying military supplies including helicopters was diverted to an airforce base near the northern city of Darwin on Thursday, a spokesman for Defence Minister Ian McLachlan told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;An AN 124 aircraft carrying defence materiel proposed to have been supplied to PNG under the Sandline (mercenary) contract has been diverted to Australia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The PNG government was concerned about the delivery of this material to PNG in the uncertain circumstances and asked Australia to receive it and store it. We have agreed to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokesman said the load included several helicopters, but would not provide further details for security reasons.</p>
<p>But Australian media reported the arsenal included attack helicopters, military vehicles, assault rifles, about 500 cases of ammunition and explosives, rockets and heat-seeking missiles.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan suspended the $36 million contract with consultancy Sandline International last week in the face of civil and military opposition to the plan to use African mercenaries to help put down a secessionist rebellion on Bougainville island.</p>
<p>The contract included the provision of sophisicated weaponry to be used against the Bougainville Revolutionary Army on the resource-rich, jungle-clad island 800 km (500 miles) northeast of Port Moresby.</p>
<p>The mercenaries' leader Tim Spicer is currently awaiting trial in Port Moresby on illegal firearm charges.</p>
<p>Chan stepped aside on Wednesday, pending the outcome of an inquiry into the awarding of the contract, after a wave of unrest climaxed in rebel troops blockading parliament, trapping about 100 politicians inside on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The streets of Port Moresby remained calm on Friday, as the country closed down for the Christian Easter holiday.</p>
<p>PNG officials, including caretaker Prime Minister and Defence Minister John Giheno could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The Australian spokesman denied one newspaper report that airforce fighter jets were scrambled to force the plane to land.</p>
<p>&quot;That report is totally inaccurate,&quot; he said, denying any planes had been sent up.</p>
<p>The aircraft was allowed to leave late on Thursday after it had been unloaded.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the fate of the load was undecided, adding there were legal issues over the ownership.</p>
