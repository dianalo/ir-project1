<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's tough talk on the entry rules for a single European currency may reflect renewed confidence about Germany's budget outlook and a desire to put added pressure on France's new government.</p>
<p>Analysts say Kohl's surprising turnaround on the deficit question could suggest that Germany will in fact bring its 1997 deficit down to 3.0 percent of Gross Domestic Product, and is not just part of the internal debate over how the Maastricht Treaty's criterion should be interpreted.</p>
<p>&quot;I think (the finance ministry) told (Kohl) that they are pretty confident they can make three percent,&quot; said one EU monetary official.</p>
<p>German coalition sources said on Thursday that Bonn was preparing a supplementary 1997 budget with a deficit that was sharply higher but would still meet the target for joining the single currency.</p>
<p>Most analysts were unable to say why the outlook for the government's finances should suddenly have become brighter. But they felt he could not have adopted such a high-profile stance without some form of legitimate backing.</p>
<p>&quot;I think his intention was to get rid of some of (Edmund) Stoiber's attacks and also because (Finance Minister Theo) Waigel promised him that they could deliver something close to 3.0 percent,&quot; said Gernot Nerb, economist at Salomon Brothers in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Stoiber, the premier of Bavaria and one of Germany's leading sceptics about monetary union, has launched a blistering attack on Bonn's apparent willingness to accept a softening in the euro's entry conditions.</p>
<p>Yet for Kohl, never given to quibbling about decimal points in the past, the more explicit reading of the criterion might have more than one purpose.</p>
<p>Several economists said Kohl might have also have wanted to send a pointed message to France. &quot;Kohl wants to signal to France not to let its deficit deteriorate too much,&quot; said Gerhardt Grebe, economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn acknowledged on Wednesday that France's 1997 deficit might be significantly above the Maastricht threshold, prompting a debate over how much red ink would be acceptable to its large eastern partner.</p>
<p>While France may believe it can get away with a deficit well above 3.0 percent of GDP, Germany has far less room for manoeuvre, given growing perceptions that the euro will be weak and will embrace a large number of founder members.</p>
<p>The one country Germany wants to keep out is Italy.</p>
<p>Under the soft euro scenario this would prove difficult, as virtually all governments with deficits slightly over the limit would be allowed in.</p>
<p>But if Bonn believes it could regain the moral high ground on budgetary rigour, Italy might find itself in a less favourable bargaining position.</p>
<p>&quot;While Italy might look as though it could qualify in 1997, its 1998 budget outlook is what will really count in German eyes,&quot; said one London-based economist.</p>
<p>France, meanwhile, was seen qualifying for the euro in 1999 with a deficit above 3.0 percent of output in 1997, but it too would have to demonstrate that it could hit the target exactly in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Germany is trying to put pressure on France and avoid a situation in which it gets the blame should EMU fall apart,&quot; the London analyst added.</p>
