<p>Relaxation of foreign exchange controls, the centrepiece of Japan's &quot;Big Bang&quot; financial reforms, could deal a body blow to Tokyo markets unless some taxes are also scrapped, experts say.</p>
<p>&quot;If the present tax system is kept in place beyond April of 1998, trading of Japanese stocks, for instance, will move out to London,&quot; Tomomitsu Oba, a former vice finance minister for international affairs, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The cabinet of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto sent a bill on the planned revisions to parliament earlier this week.</p>
<p>The revision would take effect from April 1998, Finance Ministry officials said.</p>
<p>The aim is to revitalise Tokyo markets by scrapping a rule limiting foreign exchange business to authorised banks and enabling freer cross-border capital transactions.</p>
<p>But analysts said that if controls on foreign exchange transactions are lifted without also implementing deregulatory measures in areas such as taxes, it could prompt an exodus of Japanese capital to overseas markets.</p>
<p>Makoto Utsumi, former vice finance minister for international affairs, said last month that Japanese authorities had &quot;crossed the Rubicon&quot;, or taken an irreversible decision, by deciding to liberalise foreign exchange controls.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do not succeed in removing handicaps including tax systems properly, the Japanese market will be totally hollowed out,&quot; Utsumi said.</p>
<p>Analysts have long said a securities transaction tax (STT) levied on shares makes trading in Tokyo unattractive. Most industrialised nations have no such tax.</p>
<p>Investors, except for brokerages, must pay 0.21 yen (corrects from 0.30 yen) in tax on every 100 yen worth of stock sales.</p>
<p>Some Japanese blue-chip shares are currently traded on the London Stock Exchange, where no transaction tax is levied, so Japanese investors may opt to conduct their transactions there if foreign exchange controls are lifted, said Oba, who is also a former vice finance minister for international affairs.</p>
<p>Utsumi also said: &quot;So there is no rationale for STT to exist after the total liberalisation of foreign exchange.&quot;</p>
<p>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party shares that view, saying on Thursday it would seek to speed up the Big Bang, which Hashimoto announced last November for completion by 2001.</p>
<p>According to a draft report obtained by Reuters, the party's administrative reform panel is now calling for abolition of the STT from April 1, 1998.</p>
<p>Utsumi and Oba also said their former colleagues at the ministry were well aware of the need to revise the tax system in time for the foreign exchange deregulation.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to consider reviewing...the tax, as financial reforms and liberalisation of foreign exchange transactions are now on the agenda for discussion,&quot; Nobuaki Usui, director of the ministry's Tax Bureau, said in January.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to implement the contents of the deregulation measures as soon as they are ready,&quot; Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa said on Thursday in response to the LDP's proposal to scrap the STT.</p>
<p>But some remained sceptical due to the notoriously slow pace of past reforms in Japan.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said: &quot;Like anything in Japan or anywhere else, you have to look at specific proposals as they emerge and you want to see the various layers of regulation and administrative guidance that apply to implement the regime.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials at the ministry have said it will likely reach a conclusion on how to reform Japan's securities taxes in June, after receiving a proposal from an advisory panel.</p>
