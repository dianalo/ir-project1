<title>USA: Piper Jaffray Q1 hurt by litigation costs.</title>
<headline>Piper Jaffray Q1 hurt by litigation costs.</headline>
<dateline>MINNEAPOLIS 1997-01-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Piper Jaffray Cos Inc said Wednesday that its earnings for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31 were hurt by litigation-related expenses.</p>
<p>Piper said other expenses in the first quarter of $22,181,000, up from $18,429,000 a year ago, include litigation costs related to funds or assets managed by Piper Capital Management.</p>
<p>Earlier, Piper Jaffray said its first quarter revenues rose five percent to $138.8 million from $132.5 million a year ago. Earnings, however, fell to $0.10 a share from $0.37.  </p>
<p>&quot;After a record-breaking revenue year in fiscal 1996, our revenue stream continued to grow for the first quarter of this fiscal year, although at a lower rate than for the last fiscal year,&quot; Addison Piper, chairman, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In 1996, total revenues rose to $553.9 million from $431.7 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It's disappointing, however, that litigation-related expenses continue to have a negative impact on our net income,&quot; Piper added.  </p>
<p>As previously reported, the company is a defendant in lawsuits or arbitration related to various funds or assets managed by Piper Capital, and is cooperating in investigations being conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>Piper said that, because it is impossible to predict the outcome of these actions and the effect on its consolidated financial statements, no provision for loss that may result has been recorded.</p>
<p>The company reiterated that the aggregate cost of litigation and any judgments or settlements could have a material, adverse effect on its financial statements. It added that its remaining litigation exposure is manageable, and has a team working toward resolution while staying focused on managing its business, building client relationships and attracting new clients.</p>
<p>Piper Jaffray Cos is the parent of Piper Jaffray Inc, an investment firm, Piper Capital Management Inc, a money management firm, and Piper Trust Co, which provides trust services.</p>
