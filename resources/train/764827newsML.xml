<p>Senior managers of struggling TAP-Air Portugal have accused pilots who suspended a strike over working hours of trying to destroy the state carrier, Diario de Noticias and Diario Economico newspapers reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>An internal memorandum signed by the managers was quoted as saying that the pilots were making &quot;an authentic attempt to destroy a company, which has real prospects for financial viability and profitability and is important for Portugal.&quot;</p>
<p>TAP spokesmen were not immediately available to confirm the reports, which said the memorandum was signed by senior officials in several departments, including Maintenance, Ground Operations, Flight Operations, Personnel and Planning.</p>
<p>Pilots agreed to suspend the selective strike from Monday for five days to give time to reach a deal with the company on working hours.</p>
<p>Twelve flights were cancelled over the weekend as pilots refused to operate flights not scheduled at least three days in advance.</p>
<p>Diario de Noticias quoted TAP chairman Manuel Ferreira Lima as saying that 1,500 passengers were stranded on Sunday and that the airline had lost a total of 65 million escudos ($350,000) in revenues.</p>
<p>The stoppages were due to continue throughout August and the government had warned that they could provoke heavy losses for the company during the peak holiday season.</p>
<p>TAP flies international routes and to the Portuguese mid-Atlantic islands of Madeira and the Azores.</p>
<p>The government had said that the pilots' action was risking the survival of the airline, which hoped to return to profit in 1997 after more than two decades of losses.</p>
<p>It says that it is barred by agreements with the European Union from pouring any more funds into the company, which it hopes to privatise, at least partially, before the end of the century. ($1=186.4 escudos)</p>
