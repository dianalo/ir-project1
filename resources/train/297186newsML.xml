<title>UK: OPTIONS - Bund volatility stays sluggish after data.</title>
<headline>OPTIONS - Bund volatility stays sluggish after data.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-09</dateline>

<p>The Bund market had a rush of news to contend with on Thursday but dealers said options on German debt remained listless. After a large drop in the underlying futures at the start of the year, they have range-traded since.</p>
<p>Implied volatility on Bund futures failed to pick up, having eased from earlier in the week, and business was relatively quiet. This was in the wake of German unemployment and growth data, which both underlined the soft state of the economy.</p>
<p>It also followed news Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in hospital with pneumonia, but dealers said they failed to see any sign of options trading on the back of that.</p>
<p>&quot;Vols have come off right from earlier in the week because the futures have been so quiet,&quot; a trader at a U.S. house said.</p>
<p>Vols on February options on March futures were trading around 5.60/5.75 percent, down from around 6.00 percent late on Wednesday. March vols eased to 5.90/6.00 percent from nearly 6.20 percent. April and June were both quoted around 5.80/5.90 percent, not far from Wednesday levels. &quot;It was pretty perky on the open, but it's tended to settle down after the German unemployment figures,&quot; said a broker at a French house. &quot;Now it (volatility) is starting to drift off.&quot;</p>
<p>There was some trade in 100.50 calls by U.S. banks, which one dealer said was down more to tidying up positions initiated last week rather than any directional play on the back of the day's events.</p>
<p>March Bund futures tumbled on January 2 to a 99.28 low from a 100.33 open and high. Since then they have settled into a comfortable range from 99.30 to around 100.00.</p>
<p>Earlier Germany's Federal Labour Office said German unemployment rose 48,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.156 million in December. Meanwhile the German statistics office in Wiesbaden said the economy grew a real 1.4 percent in 1996, which was slower than economists' predictions.</p>
<p>The figures, showing a lacklustre economy, were broadly supportive of the debt market.</p>
<p>Traders said Bund vols were unlikely to suffer dramatically from current levels while the market waits for Friday's all-important U.S. non-farm payroll data.</p>
