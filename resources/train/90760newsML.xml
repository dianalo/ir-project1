<p>Polish shares eased after inching up this week and analysts said the stronger selling after price fixing signalled another dip on Thursday with the bourse staying in a horizontal trend.</p>
<p>But they said investors might soon prove optimistic enough to send the market from its current 14,726.1 points to September 18's 30-month high about 100 points higher.</p>
<p>&quot;We should have a slight fall tomorrow but then maybe stronger buying after price fixing and a subsequent testing of our high,&quot; said Bogdan Kornacki, a trader at Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK) brokerage.  </p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index slipped 0.2 percent to 14,726.1 points and turnover fell 12.3 percent to 108.4 million zlotys on both markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors could be heartened if September's business climate indicator, due on Friday, rises on the back of gains in August and July.</p>
<p>They said investors would also be watching Monday's food-price figure for September's last 10 days to help determine if the year-on-year inflation rate, due at mid-month, would dip below 20 percent and give cause for an interest rate cut.  </p>
<p>They said the ruling coalition's agreement to include Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek in the new treasury ministry could help the bourse's mood.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being the political situation seems calm, which is a positive,&quot; said Krzysztof Rogalski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski brokerage.</p>
<p>Analysts were surprised by the scale of top gainer Kety's 9.9-percent jump but said Bank Komunalny, down 7.3 percent, was hit by profit-taking after surging.</p>
<p>NFI units fell 2.1 percent to 141.5 zlotys in 36.3-million-zloty trade. -- Steven Silber +48 22 653 9700</p>
