<headline>SOCCER-VICENZA END 95-YEAR WAIT FOR ITALY CUP FINAL.</headline>
<dateline>BOLOGNA, Italy 1997-02-25</dateline>

<p>Veteran striker Giovanni Cornacchini sent Vicenza through to the first Italian Cup final of their 95-year history on Tuesday and dashed the hopes of Bologna, the club he played for last season.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Cornacchini, who helped Bologna win promotion last season, rifled in a left-footed shot with just two minutes to go before injury time as the home team clung on after being reduced to 10 men in the 67th minute.</p>
<p>Vicenza, who have never won any silverware in the past and whose best previous achievement was to finish runners-up in the league in 1977-78, won the first leg 1-0.</p>
<p>But they have suffered a poor spell of form recently with just one point in three league matches. They are seventh in serie A, which they led briefly in November.</p>
<p>Bologna, beaten semifinalists last year as well, took the lead on the stroke of halftime when Giancarlo Marocchi passed to Cristiano Scapolo on the edge of the area.</p>
<p>Scapolo fired a diagonal shot across goal from the left of the box past diving goalkeeper Pierluigi Brivio.</p>
<p>Vicenza captain Giovanni Lopez was booked shortly afterwards and will miss the final against Internazionale or Napoli, having been cautioned previously in the tournament.</p>
<p>Napoli are at home to Inter on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Bologna then dominated the first 10 minutes of the second half and, having easily overcome the setback of the 1-0 away defeat, looked destined to dash Vicenza's hopes.</p>
<p>But defender Giuseppe Cardone was the sent off for bringing down Massimo Beghetto who had a clear run on goal.</p>
<p>Cornacchini then sealed matters.</p>
<p>&quot;We could have won it with Beghetto. It was a tough match but we stuck it out in the first 15 minutes of the first half,&quot; said the impassive Vicenza coach Francesco Guidolin.</p>
<p>&quot;My compliments to Bologna...we must always remember that we are just Vicenza,&quot; he added with his usual humility.</p>
