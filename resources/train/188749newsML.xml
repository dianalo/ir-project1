<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenia stocks gain as SKB jumps.</title>
<headline>Slovenia stocks gain as SKB jumps.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1996-11-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Slovenian shares rose on Thursday on the back of strength in bank SKB which today decides at its shareholders meeting about a listing abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The jump of SKB was certainly one of the biggest reasons for today's rise, but the future is still hard to predict, as the composition of the next government remains unknown,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Unofficial results from Sunday's general election show that the ruling centre-left Liberal Democrats may have to hand over power to the rightwing &quot;Spring&quot; alliance.</p>
<p>Analysts said that a shift to the right may turn off potential foreign investors from entering Slovenia's market, due to rightists' cautious stand towards Slovenia joining the European Union.</p>
<p>The 10-share SBI index rose 0.70 percent or 8.15 points to 1,173.7. Overall seven shares rose and seven fell, while 10 were untraded.</p>
<p>Turnover fell to 177.4 million tolars from 264.1 million tolars.</p>
<p>The shares of bank SKB were the most actively traded and the biggest gainer, rising 5.05 percent or 2,120 tolars to 44,130 tolars on volume of 2,378 shares for total turnover of 103.6 million tolars.</p>
<p>Brokerage Primofin was the day's leading decliner, falling 9.79 percent to 26,170 tolars on volume of 94 shares for total turnover of 2.5 million tolars.</p>
