<p>A data-starved U.S. government securities market prepared for release of the Producer Price Index on Thursday following a steep runoff late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The report was to released by the Labor Department at 0830 EST/1330 GMT.</p>
<p>A group of economists surveyed by Reuters expected, on average, that the overall PPI rate would rise 0.3 percent and the core rate -- excluding the volatile food and energy components -- by 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>Both estimates were similar to November levels.  </p>
<p>Lynn Reaser, chief economist with Barnett Bank Inc, said higher energy costs had already been factored into most estimates.</p>
<p>&quot;If the numbers come above consensus, we'll see more selloffs,&quot; Reaser said. &quot;Otherwise the market will just wait for the payrolls number.&quot;</p>
<p>The Labor Department was set to release the December nonfarm payrolls report at 0830 EST/1330 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>She said the bond market remained vulnerable, however, noting recent signs of renewed U.S. economic strength following relatively subdued third quarter growth.  </p>
<p>&quot;Unless PPI is a big surprise, I don't expect the market to move sharply either way ahead of payrolls data on Friday,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, economist with First Albany Corp.</p>
<p>Traders warned that many institutional investors have positioned for steady PPI figures and unexpected movements in either direction could cause a great deal of confusion before the more important payrolls report.</p>
<p>&quot;If the core PPI rate break above 0.3 percent, we could get a scare,&quot; said Matt Alexy, chief market strategist with Credit Suisse First Boston. &quot;But we think it will remain in forecasts and trading should stay in a range.&quot;  </p>
<p>Alexy said real fear of inflation does not creep into the market until higher energy costs begin to become evident in the final products sector.</p>
<p>&quot;When we have inflation numbers in the form of labor market tightness and earnings growth, that's when the market becomes concerned and that's why the payrolls report is so important,&quot; Alexy said.</p>
<p>Analysts expected that energy costs led by gasoline and fuel oil jumped about 2.0 percent, but should become a concern only when increases are passed along to crude and intermediate goods.  </p>
<p>Also slated for release Thursday at 1000 EST/1500 GMT was the wholesale inventories November reading. Economists polled by Reuters expected, on average, the level would rise 0.2 percent versus a 0.6 percent increase in October.</p>
<p>In addition, several Federal Reserve policymakers were scheduled to make speeches throughout the country. Of late, most such comments have been considered fairly tame.</p>
<p>The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee next meets on February 4 and 5, but few analysts expect any tightening move at that meeting. Instead, many see one coming at the FOMC's March meeting.  </p>
<p>In late trading Wednesday the 30-year bond was down 21/32 at 95-20/32 to yield 6.84 percent.</p>
<p>The two-year note was at 99-17/32 to yield 6.00 percent, down 2/32. The five-year note was down 7/32 at 99-1/32 to yield 6.35 percent, while the 10-year note was at 99-09/32, down 12/32, to yield 6.61 percent.</p>
<p>Federal funds closed at 5-13/16 versus the Federal Reserve's current target level of 5.25 percent and were expected to open trade Thursday between 5-13/16 and 5.25 percent.</p>
