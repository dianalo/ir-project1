<p>While Africa's share of available western investment capital has remained small in recent years, Africa's share of the world's expenditure on gold exploration spent is rising, said Bill Nairn, managing director of JCI Ltd, one of South Africa's leading gold miners.</p>
<p>&quot;Of the almost 600 closed-end investment funds worldwide monitored by SBC Warburg, with a total net asset value of US$128 billion, only 11 -- with a net asset value of around $1.5 billion -- are African, making up just five percent of the $27 billion invested purely in emerging markets,&quot; Nairn told the annual conference of Gold and Silver Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, there is no doubt that an increasing share of the global exploration dollar is being directed toward Africa -- over 12.8 percent of the estimated $4.6 billion spent in 1996,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The introduction of multi-party democracy and liberalized mining and investment legislation is positively influencing investment in Africa now, in the same way such moves improved the economies of South America in the past 10 to 15 years, Nairn said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, we must recognize that Africa is not for the faint hearted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Since the Egyptian revolution in 1952, there have been 78 violent or unconstitutional changes of government in Africa, some 88 leaders have been deposed. And since the 1960s, 25 presidents or prime ministers have been killed in political violence, he pointed out.</p>
<p>Violent changes of government took place in 31 African countries, of which 20 experienced violent changes more than once.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost half of Africa remains politically unstable, while another inhibiting factor is the fluid legislative environment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Of the 36 countries where information was available, ten are currently reviewing their laws and 16 others have revised their legislation since 1990.</p>
<p>Four preconditions are necessary for investment, according to the World Bank -- a legal framework defining the rights and obligations of investors, a guarantee of mining rights in advance of exploration, a tax regime that shares returns on profits fairly between government and investors, and guarantees of access to foreign exchange at market rates for repayment of debt, purchase of inputs and repatriation of profits.</p>
<p>&quot;In this respect only a few countries can demonstrate their continued favored status for investment and it is no surprise to find that there is a correlation between these countries and those African countries which are fulfilling their exploration expenditure potential,&quot; Nairn said.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, the outlook is improving for investment in Africa, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most countries in Africa with gold producing potential have made significant progress in the past decade towards creating an operating environment that enables this potential to be exploited,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ghana led the way with the passing of its Mines and Minerals Law in 1986 and this change has seen gold production rise by some 550 percent over the past 10 years to about two million ounces a year.</p>
<p>About 57 mining companies are currently active in exploration in Africa, with major contributions being made by South African mining houses ($200 million in 1996) and Canadian miners (C$100 million in 1993/94).</p>
<p>Investment is currently targeted at countries such as Ghana, Burkina Faso, Tanzania and Mali which have sound geological potential. These four countries and South Africa accounted for over 55 percent of this expenditure in 1996.</p>
<p>At 52.2 tons per annum Ghana is the most significant producer, followed by Zimbabwe (26.1 tons), Zaire (9.5 tons), Guinea (6.5 tons) and Tanzania (5.3 tons).</p>
