<p>Hudson Technologies Inc said Friday it had made a downward revision of its earnings for the first quarter of the year after finding that &quot;accounting policies and estimates&quot; made during their preparation were wrong.</p>
<p>Hudson said in a statement the restatement led to a net loss of $700,000 or $0.14 per share on revenues of $8.0 million.</p>
<p>A company officials said it had reported a net profit of $235,000 or $0.05 per share on revenues of $9.0 million when it reported the quarterly earnings for the first time in April.</p>
<p>&quot;There were accounting policies and estimates made during the preparation of the first-quarter statements that were incorrect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hudson also reported a loss of $0.57 per share for the second quarter, against a loss of $0.15 for the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>The company, which recovers and reclaims refrigerants, said the poor results for the second quarter and six-month period were due to an &quot;unseasonably cool&quot; spring and an unanticipated decline in demand and prices for some of its products.</p>
