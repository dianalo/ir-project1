<p>Bankers Trust New York Corp does not plan to take a major equity stake in Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB), Bankers Trust vice-chairman George Voita told a news conference on Friday.  </p>
<p>At the same news conference, held to announce details of a tie-up between the two banks, NCB president Hiroshi Kubota said that the two were considering securitising 50 to 100 billion yen worth of real estate and other assets.</p>
<p>Another NCB official said the first securitisation products to be developed and marketed jointly with Bankers Trust will be offered in July.  </p>
<p>Kubota also said that NCB does not plan to have any Bankers Trust executives sit on its board of directors.</p>
<p>He blasted Moody's Investors Service, a rating agency, for assigning low ratings to the long-term credit bank.</p>
<p>&quot;(The rating) is full of misunderstandings and it is unacceptable,&quot; he said, when asked his view of the fact that Moody's had not raised NCB's ratings despite the announcement two weeks ago of a tie-up with Bankers Trust to help it securitise some of its loans.</p>
<p>Asked about securitisation opportunities in Japan, Bankers Trust's Voita said, &quot;We believe securitisation has many possible applications in the Japanese market.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said Bankers Trust intended to continue its existing relationships with other Japanese banks.</p>
<p>NCB, burdened with a heavy load of problem loans, unveiled a restructuring plan on April 1 under which it would retreat from overseas operations, sell prime real estate and float new shares to try to rebuild its capital base.</p>
