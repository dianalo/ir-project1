<p>Thailand's military chief said on Saturday the military would support police and drug enforcement officials in cracking down on widespread national drug abuse.</p>
<p>Supreme Commander General Mongkol Ampornphisit said premier Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who is also defence minister, had urged the military to set up teams to support police and the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) in their war on drug trafficking.</p>
<p>The teams would focus particularly on trade in amphetamines.</p>
<p>&quot;We are studying the law and rules on how soldiers can act as law enforcers or how to be the supporting units of the ONCB on cracking down on drugs trafficking,&quot; Mongkol told reporters.</p>
<p>Current laws ban military personnel from acting as law enforcers although they can help keep the peace when the country is in a state of emergency.</p>
<p>Mongkol said the army had set up special units to help fight the drug trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister said he wishes to see the rate of drug abuse drop significantly within six months so he urged the military to support his plan,&quot; Mongkol said.</p>
<p>Chavalit, who assumed power after a November 17 general election, has declared a war against drug abuse, especially amphetamines, which are widely used in the country.</p>
<p>The ONCB said some four millions people in Thailand were addicted to amphetamines.</p>
<p>Police said they have seized about 24.5 million amphetamine tablets and arrested 35,529 people suspected of producing and dealing in amphetamines in crackdowns in the past nine months.</p>
<p>Last week, Thai police shot and killed six people suspected of being amphetamine traffickers in a summary execution that sparked a public outcry.</p>
<p>Police said they led the suspects to a house in order to search for evidence but the suspects had tried to fight back and were killed in an exchange of bullets.</p>
