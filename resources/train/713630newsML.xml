<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch bonds slipped on Tuesday, shedding part of Monday's strong gains, but ended above the session's lows as bargain-hunters put a floor under prices.</p>
<p>With a 11,000-rise in the adjusted number of unemployed to 4.734 million, German jobless data for June were on the upper end of market expectations.</p>
<p>Analysts had forecast a 8,500 rise, while one dealer said rumours predicting a 30,000 to 40,000 drop had circulated.</p>
<p>Dealers said the data gave Dutch bonds a shove, but added the support was short-lived with the market soon tracking the Bunds' downward move.  </p>
<p>&quot;What's 3,500 on an overall figure of more than four million (unemployed)?,&quot; one dealer said, explaining the lack of support generated by the release of the jobless data.</p>
<p>&quot;What counts is the overall trend, and unemployment does seem to have reached its highest peaks,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Another said disappointment that the Bund future had not crossed the 103.00-level induced some profit-taking.</p>
<p>Price levels remained under pressure during the rest of the session, breaking from Monday's uptrend.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's not really a direction to trade, but market players agree price levels are quite high,&quot; one dealer said, adding continued EMU-uncertainty had also put a brake on the rise.</p>
<p>He said no extreme moves were being made, adding that market players were definitely envisaging shortening their positions.</p>
<p>&quot;People will want to take somewhat less risk, take their profits in the long end and buy short paper,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Another said he did not see any big selling or shortening of positions going on, but added buying interest was concentrated on the five-to-ten year segment.  </p>
<p>A third dealer said the positive yield difference with Germany in short paper lured buyers into the shorter end of the Dutch market. He also noted some switching out of Dutch the Dutch long bond into the newly-issued and strippable 30 year German paper.</p>
<p>The Dutch benchmarks outperformed their German counterparts, making up for yesterday's weaker achievements.</p>
