<p>Investors weighing the risk of pouring money into Egypt, the Arab world's largest emerging market, say they are more in need of protection from copyright pirates and arbitrary tax inspectors than they are from Moslem militants.</p>
<p>Image is everything as Egypt campaigns to attract foreign and local private capital. Analysts say Cairo wants to be seen to be as tough with terrorism as it is liberal with investors.</p>
<p>Last week Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfi for the first time used security efforts to highlight the investment climate when he welcomed a truce appeal by imprisoned leaders of the Gama'a Islamiya, the most violent militant group in Egypt.</p>
<p>&quot;Our main goal as a security body is to create a favourable atmosphere to attract investment and tourists,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri has said the extension of an emergency law giving security forces broad powers was aimed at protecting the economy from &quot;terrorists&quot;.</p>
<p>Egypt's rallying cry that it has broken the back of the movement has apparently reached the right audience.</p>
<p>&quot;Egypt has been able to contain Islamic militancy,&quot; said brokerage EFG Hermes in their August report. &quot;Improving economic conditions will further de-claw the threat of fundamentalism.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the European rating agency IBCA gave an investment-grade long-term credit rating to Egypt, citing relative financial strength.</p>
<p>&quot;The internal political situation has also begun to improve. The security threat of the militant Islamists has been overcome&quot; and Ganzouri's administration &quot;is making efforts to alleviate the social conditions in which (the threat) had grown,&quot; the agency said.</p>
<p>Economy Minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali said in a statement the rating &quot;will assure investors of (Egypt's) stability&quot;.</p>
<p>How investors weigh the current militant threat is difficult to gauge. &quot;I wouldn't put it more than 10 to 15 percent,&quot; said analyst Vassilis Hadjiyannakis of International for Securities. &quot;I don't think the Gama'a is a big factor in investors' minds.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts say red tape, lack of protection for intellectual property rights, an opaque tax system, inadequate infrastructure and insufficient legal facilities were of more concern when weighing decisions.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the things I would encounter every day,&quot; said World Bank representative Khalid Ikram. As for the militant threat &quot;I would rank it very low down. It's been pretty sporadic&quot; and mostly confined to provinces in south Egypt.</p>
<p>More than 200 suspected militants are on trial in Egypt, the largest number at any time since the Gama'a took up arms in 1992 to create an Islamic state. More than 1,000 people have died in attacks but their frequency has fallen since the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>An August report by Deutsche Bank said security in Egypt has improved but &quot;in some parts...in particular the Upper Nile region, the security situation remains problematical.&quot;</p>
<p>International fund managers and currency traders are also keeping an eye on Egypt. Analysts emphasise decisions are based on a range of factors, including overall political stability.</p>
<p>A London-based emerging markets analyst said he focused on exchange controls, the level of reserves, and the narrowing spread of U.S. treasury bills compared to Egyptian t-bills.</p>
<p>&quot;The best way is to look at Egypt's credit risk ratings. We are looking at the regime as a whole. But it would be unprofessional to ignore opposition to any regime,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ed Butchart of Merrill Lynch said, &quot;I think my approach would be above all whether there is a political commitment to economic reforms. I feel it's unfairly seen as too risky. Investors are more concerned with economic fundamentals than domestic political events.&quot; His company said in a report in June that militant support has weakened.</p>
<p>A U.S. embassy report in July said that the &quot;number one&quot; complaint of foreign investors was pervasive red tape. It also said Egypt did not provide the patent protection investors want.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jon Taylor said one of his clients set up a multinational firm in Egypt this year after &quot;contact with the British and U.S. embassies on the terrorist risk&quot;. He said the client was told there was an &quot;entirely acceptable&quot; risk level.</p>
<p>One analyst said no news was not necessarily good news. &quot;There is still a dark side to Egypt. The militants have been eerily quiet for twelve months or so.&quot;</p>
