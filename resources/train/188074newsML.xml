<p>The listing of Hungarian mineral water company Kekkuti Asvanyviz Rt is not expected to bring substantial liquidity to the Budapest bourse but analysts said it might do so in the longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;The company may be ambitious to want to be listed on the bourse and a public offer is prerequisite to this,&quot; said Tibor Papp, sales executive at Raiffeisen Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;But if they assess themselves as good enough to issue 100-forint face value shares at 1,280 forints then why do they offer only a one percent package?&quot; he added. &quot;I see some controversy.&quot;</p>
<p>The answer may be that some of Kekkuti's investors may want to sell their papers later on the secondary market while the company was not in bad need of fresh capital, Papp said.</p>
<p>Kekkuti's public offer will run between November 19 and 21 when a nominal 2.326 million worth of 100-forints shares will be offered at 1,280 forints per share.</p>
<p>The issue represents about a one percent stake of Kekkuti's total registered share capital of 238.326 million forints and will enable it to raise almost 30 million forints.</p>
<p>The Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) gave its conditional approval for the listing of Kekkuti's series A shares -- a nominal 234.926 million forints -- earlier this month.</p>
<p>Calculated with the subscription price this amount represents three billion forints in market capitalisation. The BSE's share market capitalisation was 733.08 billion forints at the end of October.</p>
<p>&quot;(In market capitalisation) one could put Kekkuti between brewery Soproni and Zwack Unicum ,&quot; Papp said.</p>
<p>Sopron and spirits maker Zwack's share market capitalisation were 1.55 billion forints and 4.60 billion forints respectively, at the end of October, according to figures published in the BSE's October monthly report.</p>
<p>&quot;Kekkuti has small liquidity,&quot; said Balint Hada of New York Broker Budapest. &quot;I don't think we would include it into the NX10 index soon.&quot;</p>
<p>The NX10 is a capitalisation-weighted share index, calculated and published by New York Broker Budapest.</p>
<p>The share's liquidity on the secondary market will depend on the intentions of Merrill Lynch, one of the major shareholders, the analysts said.</p>
<p>According to the share issue prospectus Merrill Lynch group member Smith New Court Ltd held 18.40 percent of the shares on October 18. Merrill Lynch quotes over-the-counter bid and ask prices for Kekkuti shares.</p>
