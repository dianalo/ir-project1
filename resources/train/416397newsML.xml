<p>Indonesia's largest minority party will petition authorities to ease the tight controls imposed for the country's general elections in May, media reports said on Monday.</p>
<p>The government has issued regulations banning large and rowdy public rallies and the street processions common in past campaigns, and has restricted campaigning to indoor discussions and structured television debates.</p>
<p>The Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP) said after a weekend meeting that the campaign regulations disadvantaged contestants, particularly itself.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of this, the meeting has ordered the party executive board to continue to fight for an improvement in the campaign regulations and decide the party's stance towards campaign implementation,&quot; PPP secretary-general Tosari Wijaya was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.</p>
<p>Antara also quoted party chairman Ismal Hasan Metareum as saying the PPP's concerns about the election regulations did not necessarily mean the party would not take part in the campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;PPP will not rush to decide not to take part in the election campaign,&quot; Metareum said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will first seek a meeting with the minister of home affairs, the minister of information (who is also the chief of the ruling Golkar party) and the national police chief to discuss the regulations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, thousands of PPP supporters took to the streets in a rally in the central Java city of Yogyakarta despite government regulations restricting public gatherings ahead of the May 29 poll, newspapers said. Authorities have not taken any action against those who took part.</p>
<p>Last week, seven district PPP branches in central Java pledged to boycott the election campaign that begins on April 27 and ends on May 23, saying it was too hard to follow the rules. A five-day cooling-off period separates the campaign period and polling day.</p>
<p>The election will be contested only by the three approved parties, Golkar, PPP and the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).</p>
<p>Elections held simultaneously at the local, provincial and national level will see 425 legislators elected to Indonesia's mostly rubber stamp House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The armed forces, who do not vote, fill the remaining 75 seats in the 500 member parliament.</p>
