<p>A powerful explosion several hundred metres (yards) away from the U.S. embassy rocked Algiers on Tuesday, residents said.</p>
<p>The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear but ambulances were seen heading to the scene. Algiers has been rocked by a spate of bomb attacks this month blamed on Moslem rebels.</p>
<p>One foreigner working near Place Addis Ababa in the capital said: &quot;We heard a very big blast about a half hour ago. It was a huge one. It was between the U.S. embassy and the (independance) war monument.</p>
<p>&quot;There's lots of black smoke and lots of ambulances heading there -- about one or two km south of the U.S. embassy.&quot;</p>
<p>An embassy source, reached by telephone, said: &quot;It was a very big one. It shook the U.S. embassy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We heard a blast at about 4:45 p.m. (1545 GMT) in the capital but we do not know where exactly,&quot; said another resident.</p>
<p>The bomb was the third in three days. Two days ago a car bomb killed at least 21, although Algerian newspaper said 42 died and more than 100 were wounded.</p>
<p>A bomb exploded without casualties outside a school on Monday and one diplomatic source said earlier: &quot;It didn't kill anyone but that was only a matter of timing.&quot;</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
