<title>CANADA: NHL ICE HOCKEY-EDMONTON OILERS TO SELL SHARES TO PUBLIC.</title>
<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-EDMONTON OILERS TO SELL SHARES TO PUBLIC.</headline>
<dateline>EDMONTON, Alberta 1997-02-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Edmonton Oilers, who once dominated the National Hockey League with now long-departed superstars Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier, said Wednesday they plan to offer shares to the public this spring.</p>
<p>The Oilers -- who captured five Stanley Cup championships in the 1980s before falling on hard times in recent years -- said they need to raise funds to survive as a small-market club.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm doing this to keep the team here,&quot; Oilers' owner Peter Pocklington told a news conference.</p>
<p>The fate of Canada's small-market teams has been grim since the recent collapse of the Winnipeg Jets and Quebec Nordiques. The Jets moved to Phoenix while the Nordiques won the Stanley Cup last year as the Colorado Avalance.</p>
<p>Despite ice hockey being Canada's national sport, only six of the NHL's 26 teams remain in Canada, with half in cities of less than a million people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NHL's expansion plans are focused on major U.S. markets such as California and Florida -- far away from hockey's roots in small frozen towns across Canada.</p>
<p>Pocklington, who had previously threatened to move the Oilers to another city, said the public offering will &quot;cement the team in place, in a small market.&quot;</p>
<p>The Oilers will be part of a new public company that will include Pocklington's management firm, a triple A baseball team, a soccer club and a junior hockey team.</p>
<p>Pocklington said the shares will likely be priced between $3.70 and $7.40 (U.S.) per share with a prospectus available in two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Florida Panthers Holdings Inc. led by Florida businessman Wayne Huizenga, was initially offered on Nasdaq last November at $10 a share. The stock closed at $31.75 Wednesday.</p>
<p>Richard Groome, Pocklington's financial advisor, estimated the Edmonton team is worth between $74 million and $149 million based on similar clubs in the United States.</p>
<p>Most of the money from the public offering will go to pay off the Oilers' large debts to an Alberta-owned bank.</p>
<p>Pocklington, loathed by many Oilers fans after selling the Canadian-born Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, said his role in the new company will be spelled out in the offering document.</p>
<p>The Alberta entrepreneur said he would have ultimate voting control, but added: &quot;Let me say very clearly that this will not be Peter Pocklington's company. In every sense, it will be a shareholders' company.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Football League champion Green Bay Packers are the only major North American sports team fully owned and run by shareholders.</p>
<p>Pocklington said the offering marks a new era for the struggling club, which has missed the playoffs in the past four seasons.</p>
<p>The Oilers joined the NHL from the now-defunct World Hockey Association in 1979, and amassed a young corps of future NHL superstars, including Gretzky, Messier, Paul Coffey and Grant Fuhr. They led a fast, high-scoring club to five championships in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1990.</p>
<p>The team went into decline in the 1990s after most of its stars were traded away. But the Oilers are contending this season with a 25-22-4 record and second place in the NHL's Pacific Division.</p>
