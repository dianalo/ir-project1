<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenian shares give way to technical correction.</title>
<headline>Slovenian shares give way to technical correction.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1997-04-29</dateline>

<p>Slovenian shares snapped a three-day winning streak on Tuesday, falling prey to a technical correction on what traders said was meagre volume.</p>
<p>The SBI index eased 7.48 points to 1,314.87, turnover crumbled to 19.4 million tolars from 90.4 million. Overall nine shares fell, five rose and one was flat, while 12 were untraded.</p>
<p>Traders hope next week's listing of petrol trader Petrol may kick some life back into the market.</p>
<p>Petrol, one of the five largest Slovenian companies, will be listed on the main market of the Ljubljana bourse on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a standstill on the market which could finish next week, when petrol trader Petrol will be listed -- that could attract fresh investors,&quot; Andrej Caharija, a trader at brokerage BPH said.</p>
<p>&quot;If fresh buying resumes in May that could push the index back to its February levels -- if not the index could slide 10 to 20 percent,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Drug maker Lek's A issue was the most active, firming 0.37 percent to 24,200 tolars on volume of 239 shares for total turnover of 5.8 million tolars.</p>
<p>Mineral water producer and health resort operator Radenska led the day's decliners, falling 3.11 percent to 1,621 tolars on volume of 740 shares.</p>
<p>Traders said Radenska could fall further to about 1,500 tolars if small investors continue selling on the back of the firm's disappointing results and a reluctance by Radenska to defend its share price.</p>
<p>Preferred shares of Dolenjska bank were the top gainers, jumping 4.69 percent to 14,500 tolars on volume of 15 shares.</p>
<p>The bank said on Monday it planned to introduce a 15-percent foreign stake in the bank.</p>
