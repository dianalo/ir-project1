<p>A hat-trick for Atalanta on Sunday not only confirmed Filippo Inzaghi's position as the leading goalscorer in serie A but also prompted speculation about his future.</p>
<p>Inzaghi's three goals in Atalanta's 4-0 home win against Sampdoria brought his seasonal tally to 18, four goals more than closest rivals Argentine Abel Balbo of AS Roma and Vincenzo Montella of Sampdoria.</p>
<p>Aged 23 and in his sixth professional season, &quot;Pippo&quot; Inzaghi has begun to realise the promise which earned him 14 under-21 caps with Cesare Maldini, now coach of the Italian national side.</p>
<p>With the exception of last season when he scored two league goals in 15 outings as a reserve striker for Parma, Inzaghi's career so far has been played in the second and third divisions with Piacenza, Leffe and Verona.</p>
<p>But his form this season has led some of the most famous Italian and European clubs to show a keen interest in him.</p>
<p>Italian media reports indicated English champions Manchester United as potential buyers while Parma, the club which half-owns the player along with Atalanta, have allegedly offered $6.2 million dollars to buy him out totally.</p>
<p>For the time being, Inzaghi prefers not to discuss his future in depth.</p>
<p>&quot;Atalanta, Parma, foreign parts or wherever,&quot; he said. &quot;I've told my agent I don't want to talk about any of it until June, until maybe Atalanta have qualified for a UEFA Cup place.&quot;</p>
<p>Inzaghi admits a return to Parma cannot be taken for granted, because of the competition there for team places with strikers Enrico Chiesa and Argentine Hernan Crespo.</p>
<p>&quot;If, along with Parma, I decided to move to Bergamo (Atalanta), it was to be sure of playing regularly and therefore I don't see the point of returning to square one next year.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, will Parma want to play a three man attack of Chiesa, Crespo and Inzaghi...When you think that a player called (Gianfranco) Zola didn't work out there, then it makes you wonder&quot;.</p>
<p>Gianfranco Zola, currently highly successful with English club Chelsea, left Parma last November in controversial cirumstances after failing to secure a first team place as a striker.</p>
<p>Inzaghi's form this season has inevitably sparked speculation about a future possible call-up to the Italian World Cup qualifying squad.</p>
<p>Italian coach Cesare Maldini was an interested spectator at Bergamo on Sunday, a point not lost on Inzaghi.</p>
<p>&quot;It's normal that I'm thinking about being called up, just as it is normal that day after day you fix new objectives for yourself.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad Maldini saw Atalanta against Sampdoria because he saw how the Inzaghi of these days is making out, but he really didn't need to. We worked together for four years in the under-21 team and few people know me as well as he does and therefore nobody will know better than him when is the right moment to give me a call-up&quot;.</p>
<p>Inzaghi also says he enjoys an excellent relationship with his current coach, Emilio Mondonico, pointing out that the Atalanta coach had no hesitation in playing him on Sunday despite his not having trained during the week because of an ankle problem.</p>
<p>&quot;He's a coach who talks to us just as he plays cards with us. He's like a father or an older brother and indeed when I do have to decide what move to make, I'll ask his advice.&quot;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Inzaghi shows no signs of losing his appetite for scoring goals.</p>
<p>When, with the score at 2-0, Atalanta were awarded a penalty against Sampdoria on Sunday, Inzaghi got into a blazing row with team mate Domenico Morfeo as he demanded to take the spot kick.</p>
<p>Morfeo won the argument, took the kick and scored but Inzaghi went on to complete his hat-trick anyway, scoring the final Atalanta goal in injury time.</p>
