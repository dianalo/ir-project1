<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed higher on a strong rally in the soybean complex, traders said.</p>
<p>Support came from news the European Union may wrap up soft wheat exports from the 1996-97 campaign before the traditional end-April deadline. But export sources said EU wheat values remain below U.S. prices.</p>
<p>Also the market found underlying support on evidence of strong stopping of the deliveries posted against the March contract, traders said.</p>
<p>Diminished concerns about flood damage to the U.S. wheat crop also limited gains.</p>
<p>Talk circulated last week that flooding in the Ohio River Valley could harm the wheat crop there but agronomists Friday said very little wheat would be damaged.</p>
<p>USDA's weekly export inspections report did little to help the bull's cause. USDA Monday said 13.857 million bushels of U.S. wheat were inspected for export the week ended March 6. There were expectations for 14 million to 17 million bushels.</p>
<p>Wheat ended 1-1/2 to 3-3/4 cents a bushel higher, with March up 1-1/2 at $3.76-1/2. New crop July closed up three cents at $3.66-1/2.</p>
