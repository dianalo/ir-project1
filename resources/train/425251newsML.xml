<headline>Thai baht falls, resignation rumour denied.</headline>

<p>The Thai baht fell against the dollar on Thursday after rumours the head of the central bank was quitting, but a Bank of Thailand official denied the speculation.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange dealers blamed on the currency's fall on speculation that central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond might resign.</p>
<p>The rumours followed reports in some small Thai business newspapers that Rerngchai might have prepared his resignation letter and could submit it to the finance minister later on Thursday.</p>
<p>The baht fell to 25.960/965 against the dollar from around 25.945/950 late on Wednesday on the rumour, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumours have affected the baht. People are moving to the dollar,&quot; said a senior dealer with a foreign bank.</p>
<p>However, the central bank later denied Rerngchai would resign.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been asked to categorically deny these rumours in the market,&quot; a senior Bank of Thailand official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The baht, which came under speculative attack late last year and in February due to pressure from a strong dollar and devaluation rumours, had recently steadied after authorities firmly ruled out devaluation.</p>
<p>The Thai stock market remained mostly unaffected by the talk, with brokers saying they were more concerned about the health of finance companies and high interest rates.</p>
<p>Two Moody's Investors Service officials are in Bangkok this week and have met Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan and central bank officials to gather data on the Thai economy.</p>
<p>The agency had last month put Thailand's long term debt rating on watch for a possible downgrade. The Moody's officials' plans for gathering more data on Thursday were not available.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports speculated that Rerngchai might resign in protest over the government's suspension of three Bank of Thailand officials, including deputy governor Jaroong Nookhwun, on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The officials were suspended in connection with their failure to bring former executives of the ailing Bangkok Bank of Commerce to court for violations of the Banking Act, a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors last month said they were forced to drop a government case against the executives because a one-year statute of limitations had expired.</p>
