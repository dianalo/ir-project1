<p>NEW YORK, July 24, 1997 -- Moody's has assigned a Baa1 rating to the City of La Crescent's now offered $1,280,000 General Obligation Improvement Bonds of 1997. Our stable outlook incorporates the expectation that financial margins will remain at the current level and will not revert to the narrow balances of earlier years. The rating is further supported by the city's favorable debt position and recent tax base expansion.</p>
<p>The city succeeded in reversing a five year trend of operating deficits at fiscal year end 1995 achieving a General Fund balance equivalent to about 37% of operating revenues. Despite a small drawdown in 1996 a similar position was maintained. However, expenditures in both years exceeded budgeted levels and revenues above budget were primarily attributable to non-recurring sources. Officials indicate that at this time positive operations are anticipated for 1997 and the Council's goal is to enhance the balance going forward.</p>
<p>The city has been a regular borrower to finance necessary infrastructure improvements for its growing population. In recent years both the wastewater treatment plant and the water system have been upgraded and sufficient capacity exists to support further development. The city's direct debt level, at 2.6% of market value, is above the median of 2.1% for similarly sized cities. Debt burden, which is below the median, is expected to rise as overlapping units, specifically the school district, may have to expand to service enrollment growth. Debt structure is strong with bonds rapidly retired and while debt service claims about 36% of the budget the majority of support is from non-levy sources.</p>
<p>Its location, only ten miles from the City of La Crosse, Wisconsin, provides the city with an alternate source of jobs outside of the agriculturally dominated area economy. Resident wealth, as indicated by per capita income, is only slightly below average and has kept pace with growth elsewhere in the state. Poverty rates are low and unemployment is below the state and nation. The city has experienced double digit tax base growth over the last two years and permits to date indicate similar growth level this year. ANALYSTS:</p>
