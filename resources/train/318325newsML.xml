<p>South Africa will not start pumping from its first oilfield until late March after high winds delayed the planned departure of the Orca semi-submersible floating production facility from Simon's Town, officials said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for state-run oil firm Soekor said it could take another week to load equipment, after which the Orca would be towed into False Bay for sea trials before heading out to its final site 130 km southwest of Mossel Bay.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still in the harbour. It will take at least another six to seven days to get all the equipment on to the rig,&quot; spokesman Andre van Niekerk said by telephone from Cape Town.</p>
<p>&quot;We're now looking at starting production at the end of March.&quot;</p>
<p>Soekor and its 20 percent partner Energy Africa Ltd had originally hoped to start pumping from the Oribi field next month, but the project encountered several delays.</p>
<p>The new field is a minnow by world standards, with an expected production rate of 20,000 barrels of low sulphur crude a day, but it will supply some five percent of South Africa's current crude oil needs.</p>
<p>Crude from the field will be pumped to a one-million-barrel shuttle tanker moored at an adjoining buoy and then shipped to South African refineries in Cape Town or Durban.</p>
<p>With probable recoverable reserves of 20 million barrels, Oribi would have a production life of four years, although the actual outcome could be anything between two and six years.</p>
<p>Oribi is also expected to form the nucleus of development for several smaller fields in the Bredasdorp Basin, which should add extra recoverable reserves of 15 million to 40 million barrels, providing a further three to six years' life.</p>
