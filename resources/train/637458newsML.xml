<p>Less than half of India's businessmen expect the pace of industrial growth to quicken in the first half of 1997/98 (April-March), a survey conducted by a top industry body said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) poll covering 410 companies also said 58 percent expected the industrial production rate to cross 10 percent in the six months.</p>
<p>Industrial output grew by 7.5 percent in the first 10 months of 1996/97 compared with an 11.7 percent rise in the corresponding period in the previous year.</p>
<p>In a similar survey conducted last year, only 26 percent of the respondents said they expected industrial growth to pick up.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation rate is also seen at a moderate five to 10 percent by 69 percent of the respondents,&quot; the survey said.</p>
<p>More than 70 percent of the firms polled expect capital expenditure to grow over the year, and nearly half foresee a capacity utilisation rate of more than 80 percent, CII said.</p>
<p>During the last six months of 1996/97, 35 percent of the respondents achieved above 80 percent capacity utilisation, the survey said.</p>
<p>&quot;A major bottleneck threatening industrial growth and performance was infrastructure constraints,&quot; the poll said, listing an acute shortage of power as the top problem of nearly one-third of the firms polled.</p>
<p>&quot;Another major bottleneck continues to be finance, with problems being faced on extended credit to customers, availability of adequate credit, cost of borrowings, increase in finished stock, and delays in sanctions and disbursements,&quot; the poll said.</p>
<p>Nearly 60 percent of exporters surveyed said they expected the value of new orders to improve, but about one third said they predicted no change.</p>
