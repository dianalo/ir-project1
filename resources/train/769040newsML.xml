<p>Mexican stocks soared to breathtaking heights Thursday as bullish investors crowned the country the new gem among emerging markets.</p>
<p>&quot;It's almost the flip side of what recently happened in Brazil. Instead of panic selling you've got panic buying,&quot; said Todd Edwards, Latin American investment strategist at the Latinvest brokerage.</p>
<p>Since landmark midterm elections July 6, the Mexican stock market has gotten a new lease on life, buoyed by the recovering economy and the best signs of widespread business profits in years.</p>
<p>With liquidity high as investors look for a safe haven from currency woes in Asia, and with local rival Brazil considered overbought, Mexico has become the emerging market of choice in the cutthroat race for investment, experts said.</p>
<p>Early Thursday, Mexico's IPC index barely paused as it burst through the 5,000-point barrier for the first time ever. By midafternoon it had clocked up gains of 150.67 points, or 3.03 percent, to reach a new record of 5,124.90.</p>
<p>The market pared earlier gains at the close Thursday, but was still up 93.60 points at a record 5,067.83. These gains came following the highest rise ever in terms of points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Underpinning confidence was a rock-solid peso that appears to have shed much of the stigma left over from a disastrous devaluation in 1994.</p>
<p>Democracy has also helped. In congressional elections earlier this month, opposition parties broke the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's 68-year lock on the lower house of Congress, which analysts said cut the risk of political storms.</p>
<p>&quot;We've washed out of the elections and the mid-month turbulence on Brazil, so we're off to the races again,&quot; said Geoffrey Dennis, emerging markets startegist at HSBC-James Capel.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling is upward earnings momentum is here, the economy is improving on the margin and you have a vote of confidence in the peso.&quot;</p>
<p>For Vinod Seghal, head of equity research at the Societe General brokerage, Mexico may have become a logical venue for emerging market funds.</p>
<p>&quot;You take liquidity away from Asia and off the major markets, and it has to go to Brazil or Mexico, and there is a feeling that Brazil may have played out,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Seghal also said the recent slew of second-quarter earnings reports had helped propel gains.</p>
<p>&quot;At last there are signs of growth in consumption, which is what we've all been waiting for for two years -- previously it was all export-based,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the stockwatchers said the market still had strong upside potential, but said healthy profit-taking could intervene along the way.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happening now is a function of liquidity ... and people should not underestimate what liquidity can do,&quot; Seghal said. &quot;It's hard to make a bearish case right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Dennis said he would not recommend heavy profit-taking until the IPC headed toward a mid-1998 target of 5,600 points, although he said he may have to bring that target forward.</p>
<p>The main stumbling block for the market, the analysts said, was a strong peso that could eat into earnings posted by exporting companies for the third quarter in October.</p>
<p>Dennis said that, although investors may become nervous that the peso could slip, the risk of a free fall was reduced.</p>
<p>&quot;The maximum adjustment in the peso will be 8 percent, and that's about a day's worth in Asian markets recently,&quot; he said.</p>
