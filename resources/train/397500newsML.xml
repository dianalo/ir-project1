<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Persetel shares fall after results.</title>
<headline>Persetel shares fall after results.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-02-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in computer concern Persetel Holding Ltd fell on Monday on investor disappointment with interim results.</p>
<p>Although attributable earnings jumped 92.4 percent to 55.4 million rand and earnings increased 57.5 percent to 29.3 cents a share, dealers said the good results were mainly on offshore operations and not local business.</p>
<p>Earnings were also boosted by an abonormal gain of 11.0 million rand on the disposal of subsidiaries.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the 11 million rand abnormal item figure it translates to a growth figure of about 14 percent. The emphasis on offshore operations is strategic,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The share fell 310 to 30.50 in a volume of 370,000 shares.</p>
<p>The company was also cautious on short-term prospects noting that results of the South African business would be affected negatively by the timing of the completion of certain large contracts and the high interest burden resulting from the high asset level in the PC business.</p>
<p>The stock had jumped on Friday on anticipation of good results and shareholders were now bailing out, dealers said.</p>
<p>One dealer said the information technology stocks were also under pressure in Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow Jones' IT stocks are under pressure with talk that results may not be as good as expected,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Some said the share was starting to look cheap at lower levels.</p>
