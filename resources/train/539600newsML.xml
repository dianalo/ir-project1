<headline>Indian rupee ends down on RBI, SBI dlr purchases.</headline>

<p>The rupee closed Friday at 35.7650/7700 against the dollar on sustained purchases by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank, and the State Bank of India (SBI), the largest commercial bank, dealers said.</p>
<p>The spot rupee opened at 35.745/755 and hardly moved until after noon when SBI's dollar demand hit the market, they said. Its sustained purchases pushed down the rupee to 35.77 level.</p>
<p>&quot;He (SBI) was buying towards late evening,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;People will be watching out if his demands have been met. So I think 35.75 level should hold on Monday,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The RBI bought June, August and September delivery dollars in the forwards section, trying to push up forward premiums from the lows they had touched in recent weeks, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what is more important is the RBI is in the market and has been bidding higher each time,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>RBI's outright forward purchases helped push the six months annualised premium to 4.47 percent from the previous close of 4.36 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;A sharp drop in forward premiums is more worrisome for exporters rather than the 10 paise appreciation in the spot rate,&quot; N.S. Paramasivam, vice president (forex) at Essar Group of firms said on Friday, referring to the rupee's recent rise to 35.75 level from 35.80 level.</p>
<p>&quot;The rupee could test further higher levels - even 35.65,&quot; he said.</p>
