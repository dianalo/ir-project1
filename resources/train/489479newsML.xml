<title>SRI LANKA: Sri Lanka says no foreign mediation to end war.</title>
<headline>Sri Lanka says no foreign mediation to end war.</headline>
<dateline>COLOMBO 1997-04-05</dateline>

<p>The Sri Lankan government said on Saturday that a British-assisted bipartisan agreement signed this week to work towards ending the country's ethnic war was not a prelude to foreign mediation in the matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The government was not contemplating mediation or facilitation by any foreign government or third party at this point of time,&quot; Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar was quoted as saying in a release issued by the ministry.</p>
<p>Kadirgamar made the comments when he addressed local newspaper editors on Friday about an agreement signed the day before by Sri Lanka's ruling People's Alliance and the main opposition United National Party (UNP) to work together to end the 13-year-old war with separatist Tamil rebels.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga and opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe agreed on Thursday to take a &quot;common approach&quot; to end the country's war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).</p>
<p>Kadirgamar said Britain had played an important role in the settlement between the two parties.</p>
<p>&quot;While acknowledging the help given by the British in forging the People's Alliance-UNP understanding, (Kadirgamar) said implementation of this agreement is entirely a national matter,&quot; the Foreign Ministry statement said.</p>
<p>The agreement was also widely seen as a move that would usher in fresh peace talks with the rebels.</p>
<p>But the statement quoted Kadirgamar as saying there was no plan at this point of time for talks with the LTTE.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has consistently expressed willingness to open a dialogue with the LTTE, subject to conditions including a substantial laying down of arms and an agreement to arrive at a settlement within a stipulated time frame,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The LTTE's spokesman in London was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east. The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war.</p>
