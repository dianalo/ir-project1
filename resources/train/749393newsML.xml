<p>Secretary of state Madeleine Albright said Wednesday that fast track trade negotiation authority was critical to U.S. global leadeship and one of her highest foreign policy priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;At stake is the chance to expand trade further and create more American jobs,&quot; Albright said in a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council.  </p>
<p>Also at stake is the &quot;indispensible contribution that our economic leadership makes to U.S. influence around the globe ...we cannot sit on the sidelines with towels over our heads while others seize the opportunities presented by the global marketplace,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is why from foreign policy perspective, I consider fast track among our highest legislative priorities.&quot;</p>
<p>She pledged to work hard with Clinton to gain congressional support for fast track.</p>
<p>Fast track authority would allow administration officials to negotiate an expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement to include Chile and other trade deals without fear they will later be changed by Congress.</p>
<p>The administration has been without fast track authority since 1994 and was expected to propose legislation to Congress earlier this year. But the White House decided to delay action on it until September to allow lawmakers time to work on the budget and proposed tax package. Administration officials are also struggling to find a consensus on whether labor and environmental issues should be included in the negotiation authority.</p>
