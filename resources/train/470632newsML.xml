<p>A subsidary of Polish Budimex builder  Budimex-Poznan has signed a contract with MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, a unit of Germany's MAN AG, to construct a bus assembly plant in Poland, Budimex-Poznan's head said.</p>
<p>Wojciech Wierzbicki told Reuters that under the agreement, signed on Monday, his company would build the factory's production site and its infrastructure by October 17, 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We will provide all construction and building works as well as installations, except for installing machines for production,&quot; Wierzbicki told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the value of the contract with MAN was a part of the total cost of the factory's construction of 23 million marks, but declined to disclose the exact value of the deal.</p>
<p>The construction of MAN's factory, which will initially assemble 120 buses annually and employ 250 people, was launched on Tuesday, PAP news agency reported.</p>
<p>The output of the plant, located near the western city of Poznan, would eventually be expanded to 600 buses annuaLly and the workforce to 900, PAP said.</p>
<p>Wierzbicki said Budimex had a controlling stake in Budimex-Poznan. The municipality of Poznan and several individual investors held the remaining shares, he said.</p>
<p>PAP has quoted MAN's management board member Franz Breun as saying that his company counted on orders from Polish cities, which needed to replace half of municipal transport buses.</p>
