<headline>Nasdaq surges after favorable employment report.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Nasdaq shares jumped along with the Dow industrials and bond prices after the release of a monthly employment report that was viewed by investors as generally favorable for the markets, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index added 14.79 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1404.84. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 24-to-17 ratio on total volume of 594 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, the whole market surged. The stocks followed the bonds, which just surged after people sifted through the numbers,&quot; one trader said, referring to the employment data.</p>
<p>The rally benefited both large-cap and small-cap stocks, traders said. The Russell 2000 index gained 2.13 points, or 0.55 percent, to a closing high of 387.12.</p>
<p>Technology stocks firmed Friday, with Intel Corp adding 2-55/64 to 146, and Microsoft Corp gaining 3-1/2 to 124-1/16. Dell Computer Corp increased 3-11/16 to 112-1/8. Avant! Corp jumped 3-7/8 to 25 after a contract with Lucent Technologies Inc's Microelectronics Group was extended.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Storage Dimensions Inc fell 3-15/16 to 6-5/16 after it warned its second-quarter results would fall short of earlier expectations.</p>
