<p>New Zealand shares ended weaker but off their lows after a sedate Thursday session.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 9.41 points down at 2,417.80 on turnover worth NZ$37.5 million, much of it done late in the session. The index had earlier hit a low of 2,414.88.</p>
<p>Campbell Stuart at SBC Warburg said there was little specific corporate news for the market to react to.</p>
<p>&quot;It certainly felt pretty quiet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Among the movements, Fletcher Paper lost five cents to close at NZ$2.89 and Telecom lost two to $7.52. Both were marginally off their lows.  </p>
<p>Fisher and Paykel was under pressure, losing 14 cents to NZ$5.35. Stuart suggested the whiteware manufacturer may be feeling the pinch of a strong New Zealand dollar.</p>
<p>Clothing retailer Hallenstein Glasson gained four to NZ$2.79, despite earlier reporting that December 1996 sales had fallen 4.6 percent on a same-store basis over December 1995.</p>
<p>Hallenstein's statement did not hold a lot of good news, but it didn't mean seriously bad news either, Stuart said.  </p>
<p>&quot;They have proved to be a good quality company over time and a good manager of their stock. While they have probably not had the Christmas they would have liked, they are probably not likely to materially disappoint either,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Among other issues, Cultus Petroleum gained 10 cents to NZ$1.58, a year high.</p>
