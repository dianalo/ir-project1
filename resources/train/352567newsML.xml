<headline>RTRS-MIM says holding talks on zinc output.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-02-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>MIM Holdings Ltd said on Monday it was holding talks with its customers worldwide on the impact of reduced zinc concentrate production this year.</p>
<p>MIM expects to produce about 360,000 tonnes of zinc concentrates this financial year ending June 30, down from 410,000 tonnes last year, due to reduced mine activity at its Hilton deposit near Mt Isa in Queensland.</p>
<p>MIM said in December that it planned to reduce production of zinc ore at Hilton to 900,000 tonnes from 1.3 million tonnes as part of cost cutting measures.  </p>
<p>Nick Stump, chief executive of MIM, declined to comment directly on a Reuters report that MIM would be reducing supplies of zinc concentrate to Europe by half this year.</p>
<p>&quot;There is definitely a shift to Asia, although to what degree we will have to wait and see,&quot; Stump told Reuters.</p>
<p>Jeff Ballard, executive general manager of metals for MIM, said discussions over supplies of zinc concentrates to smelters were still in progress with final terms yet to be determined.</p>
<p>&quot;We're talking to everyone about the effects of lower production,&quot; Ballard told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Stump also said there was a clear advantage in terms of freight costs in shipping more concentrates to Asia at the expense of Europe.</p>
<p>European smelter sources at the American Zinc Association Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, told Reuters MIM would cut by half the amount of zinc concentrates it would supply to them this year.</p>
<p>Among those said by the sources to have received a letter from MIM were Union Miniere SA, Outokumpu Oy and Billiton, a unit of Gencor Ltd.</p>
