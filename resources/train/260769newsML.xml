<p>Gold ticked higher on Tuesday on the back of weaker stock market and coffee lost some ground but other commodity markets were becalmed ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>Copper's price slide from six-month highs hit last month accelerated this week and more volatility is expected as the market seeks direction after the shockwaves from the Sumitomo scandal earlier this year.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $368.95 an ounce against Monday's $367.55 after a stronger-than-expected U.S. housing starts data depressed U.S. bond and share prices.</p>
<p>The data jangled market nerves over interest rate hike prospects.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. Federal Reserve is not expected to move on interest rates after Tuesday's regular Federal Open market Committee, some economists fear a rate hike could come early next year.</p>
<p>But generally, investors continued to stay away from gold.</p>
<p>&quot;It would take something extraordinary to move the gold market,&quot; said one. &quot;By now 50-point movments on Wall Street are run of the mill.&quot;</p>
<p>As with other commodities, gold market activity is slowing down ahead of Christmas and the New Year.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything's winding down for Christmas. There's not much interbank trading and I can't see anything significant happening,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>In coffee, London prices lost about two percent at one stage on origin selling. But they ended with pared losses on reports a cold airmass was threatening the Mexican coffee belt.</p>
<p>In base metals, copper see-sawed around $2,100 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange after a more bullish than expected stock report shook the market as it approached the slow holiday period.</p>
<p>Overall, the metal has given up $200 from its peak in late November, the highest since Sumitomo Corp uncovered billions of dollars in losses in June, sending prices crashing.</p>
<p>The year's high was hit in May at around $2,700 per tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you'd have to expect more volatility...There's no indication that it won't flare up again,&quot; said analyst Robin Bahr of broker Brandeis.</p>
<p>LME copper stocks have edged up to 115,375 tonnes, up slightly from a 6-1/4 year low hit in late November, but still under half the 275,775 tonnes in September.</p>
