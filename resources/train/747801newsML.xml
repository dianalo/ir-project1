<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah trapped in range trading.</title>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was trapped in range trading between 2,600 and 2,630 to the dollar in early trade on Tuesday after strengthening earlier, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the rupiah, which plunged to a record 2,665 low on Monday, rose to a high of 2,610 before easing back to the 2,627/30 level and bouncing again to 2,610/15 at 0205 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend suggests possible recovery of the rupiah. We see some attempts from Singapore players to cash out from the high dollar level,&quot; one Japanese bank dealer said.  </p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said the plunge of the rupiah on Monday was too excessive and was not supported by Indonesia's sound economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is room for a recovery today. But the dollar is well supported at the 2,550 level and it is not easy to break the 2,600 rupiah resistance level,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. bank dealer said the central bank also managed to contain speculation in the swap market as it kept liquidity supply sufficient in the money market.</p>
<p>Overnight rupiah was traded at 13.0/14.0 percent.</p>

<p>&quot;If the 2,600 level is broken, the dollar can fall all the way down to as low as the 2,570 level,&quot; one local bank dealer said.</p>
<p>He said many operators could be forced to cut losses in the afternoon when the London market opens if the rupiah broke the 2,600 resistance level.</p>
<p>The rupiah became the latest victim of a speculative currency attack on Monday, plunging about 150 points to a historic 2,665 low against the dollar before staging a marginal recovery on central bank intervention.  </p>
<p>But it appeared to be on the way to recovery on Tuesday, with speculators seen taking profits from the high dollar.</p>
<p>The rupiah/dollar spot rate was quoted at 2,603/06 at 0345 GMT from a 2,633/43 open.</p>
<p>Dealers said swap rates were also moving to the left on the back of sufficient liquidity supply. Short-dated swaps were traded at par level.</p>
