<p>Taiwan's Formosa Plastics group promised on Monday to drop an unauthorised US$3 billion power plant in China if Taipei denies the conglomerate a permit allowing it to finance the project.</p>
<p>The statement follows a government inquiry launched earlier on Monday into the controversial project, with officials vowing to take tough measures against any violation.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government ultimately decides not to allow the investment, Formosa group will respect the government's policy and abandon this investment project and turn it over to overseas business groups,&quot; Formosa said in a statement.</p>
<p>Formosa Plastics chairman Wang Yung-ching confirmed on Saturday the group had started building the thermal power plant in China's coastal Fujian province in defiance of Taipei.</p>
<p>Taiwan economic affairs minister Wang Chih-kang said he had received assurances from Formosa's Wang Yung-ching that it would withdraw from the project if denied a permit, and said Taiwan had no intention of allowing Formosa to finance the plant.</p>
<p>&quot;We can clearly declare that the government will not allow investment in power plants (in the Chinese mainland),&quot; Wang Chin-kang said on state radio.</p>
<p>Taiwan forbids direct China investments, obliging firms to route even small investments through Hong Kong or other third places after obtaining permits from the economic ministry.</p>
<p>Officials and analysts have said Formosa group could dodge Taiwan's regulations by channelling the funds through its overseas affiliates or holding companies.</p>
<p>But Formosa said on Monday no Formosa unit, affiliate or executive in Taiwan or the United States had put money in the project.</p>
<p>Central Bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong told lawmakers that an initial central bank inquiry showed Formosa had not illegally sent money to China from Taiwan, state media reported.</p>
<p>The announcements from Formosa and the economic ministry capped a day of uncertainty and intense anxiety over the fate of the giant investment, with Taiwan stocks tumbling 1.42 percent -- largely due to a selloff in the plastics sector.</p>
<p>Shares in Formosa's four listed units led the losses.</p>
<p>In June 1996, Formosa said it and local Fujian authorities would jointly build a 3,600-megawatt plant in what easily would have been the biggest Taiwan investment in China and the first in the power sector, which Taipei had banned.</p>
<p>Formosa sought government approval but backed out two months later after President Lee Teng-hui urged local firms to slow their investments in the arch rival Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Taiwan food giant and top China investor, President Enterprises, said in September 1996 that it had abandoned a US$100 million power station in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.</p>
<p>Communist China has regarded Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949, vowing to take the island back by force if necessary.</p>
<p>Taiwan says it espouses reunification, but not before Beijing implements democracy.</p>
<p>Taiwan still bans investment in major Chinese strategic projects such as power generation and carmaking as well as banking, insurance and other financial projects.</p>
<p>In 1992, Formosa Plastics withdrew a proposal to build a multi-billion dollar petrochemical complex in China -- again under government pressure.</p>
