<p>Yemen publicly executed a man on Saturday who shot dead four children and two teachers, shooting him with a Kalashnikov in front of cheering crowds across from two schools where the killings took place.</p>
<p>A large crowd jammed into an empty plot by the schools cheered during the execution of Mohammad Ahmad Misleh, 48, who was sentenced to death for opening fire with an assault rifle on hundreds of school children on Sunday.  </p>
<p>Misleh was forced to lie down with his face to the ground and was executed with five shots by a single sharpshooter.</p>
<p>Onlookers chanted and whistled as they formed a circle around the site, while others scrambled onto the roofs of houses to win a better view in the middle class residential suburb of Asbahi, about seven km (four miles) south of the city centre.</p>
<p>As the shots rang out, crowds yelled &quot;Allahu akbar&quot; (God is greatest) and &quot;long live justice&quot; before breaking out into applause.</p>
<p>Yemen's supreme court on Thursday approved the death sentence ruling of a Yemeni appeals court, but overturned a decision which said Misleh's body should also be nailed on a cross for three days near the site of the murders.</p>
