<title>THAILAND: Thailand election campaign &quot;most violent in years&quot;.</title>
<headline>Thailand election campaign &quot;most violent in years&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1996-11-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A private poll research agency on Monday described Thailand's November 17 election campaign as the dirtiest and most violent since the mid-1970s when student-led democracy groups toppled Thai military governments.</p>
<p>The Rajapak Institute said major political parties had resorted to blatant vote-buying, political assassination and other electoral law violations in their campaigns in rural areas, especially in northeast Thailand.</p>
<p>&quot;This election is the messiest, the worst in terms of electoral violations, the most violent,&quot; Uthai Dejatanond, director of the Rajapak Institute's northeast branch, told a news conference. &quot;These are acts that blatantly challenge democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Uthai did not single out any political party for leading electoral law violations but the northeast region is the stronghold of the New Aspiration Party (NAP) headed by prime ministerial hopeful Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.</p>
<p>The Rajapak Institute predicted the NAP may capture up to 70 of 137 lower House of Representative seats up for grabs in the election. It expected the Democrat Party, led by former Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, to win as few as 13 seats in the region.</p>
<p>More than one third of the lower house's 393 seats come from northeastern Thailand.</p>
<p>Preecha Uatrakul, a lecturer at the institute, told Reuters he believed the NAP and other major parties -- Democrat, Chart Pattana and Chart Thai -- had all been involved in direct vote-buying.</p>
<p>The four parties have in the past week stepped up trading charges of vote-buying, while current opposition parties, the Democrat and Chart Pattana, have accused Chavalit and Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa of Chart Thai of peddling influence.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the unfortunate facts is the party with the most money to dump in this election can buy Thailand,&quot; Preecha said. &quot;Northeastern voters could not distinguish between good and bad politicians and election candidates fully exploit their priority for money.&quot;</p>
<p>Preecha's institute said that the average price of buying a vote in the northeast had risen to 200 baht ($8) in the current poll from 50 baht in the past two elections.</p>
<p>Seventeen people have been attacked by unidentified gunmen, seven of them killed, since campaigning began on September 27, police said.</p>
<p>Campaign workers are usually prime targets for gunmen rather than candidates because they are better known and more influential locally than the politicians, police said.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Banharn ordered police to step up efforts to curb violence ahead of the poll.</p>
