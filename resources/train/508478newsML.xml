<headline>France to support thematic TV channels - minister.</headline>
<dateline>CANNES, France 1997-04-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Philippe Douste-Blazy, France's culture minister, has opened the annual MIP television trade fair at Cannes and announced new state measures to back thematic television channels.</p>
<p>He said on Friday the minimum investment in a programme giving a channel the right to state financial support would be cut to 15 percent of the estimated total from 25 percent currently.</p>
<p>This support could be as much as 30 percent of the total cost and would be granted to a producer in receipt of an order, either in co-production or pre-buying, from a thematic channel, he said.</p>
<p>There would be special support for magazine programmes and productions of plays, Douste-Blazy said.</p>
<p>He said he hoped COSIP, the fund managed by the Centre National de la Cinematographie (CNC), the body which awards financial support to film and television programme makers, would fulfill its role among newcomers to broadcasting and production.</p>
<p>This year MIP-TV has attracted 2,444 companies from 100 different countries, up from 2,380 last year.</p>
<p>Broadcasters from Bermuda, Jamaica, Kazakhstan and Macao were present for the first time.</p>
