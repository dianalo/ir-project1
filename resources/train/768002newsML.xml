<p>The Algerian government on Wednesday drafted a mini-budget for the next five months to meet inflated state expenditure, the cabinet said.</p>
<p>In a statement on the official Algerian news agency APS, it said the increased spending on top of the original 1997 budget stemmed mainly from pay rises for government workers and pensions, along with payment of debts due to state-owned firms and the cost of holding local elections.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a good reason to make clear that the drawing of the (mini-budget) text was made necessary due to the emergence of new expenditure since the beginning of the year,&quot; the cabinet said.</p>
<p>But it said the extra spending would not upset state finances and swell the budget deficit because Algeria had additional income from higher world oil prices than it had originally forecast.</p>
<p>The cabinet said the government had based the budget on a conservative oil price of $17.50 a barrel but Algerian crude had earned more than that. It gave no details.</p>
<p>The government draws more than half of its budget from oil and gas taxes.</p>
<p>The cabinet did not give all the figures for the emergency expenditure, saying only that they included salary hikes for civil servants, subsidies for the retirement fund, underwritting of debts due to state-owned companies and the cost of local elections.</p>
<p>These items totalled 29 billion dinars ($500 million).</p>
<p>The statement made no mention of any provision for extra spending expected after a severe drought which has badly hit about one million farmers and this year's cereal harvest.</p>
<p>The draft mini-budget will be the first budget to be submitted by the government to a multi-party National Assembly (lower house) elected in June and representing 10 political parties and 11 independents.</p>
<p>But the three-party coalition government has a secure majority to pass the budget.</p>
<p>According to official figures reported earlier by APS, Algeria forecast 829.4 billion dinars ($14.8 billion) total revenue against 914.1 billion dinars ($16.32 billion) expenditure, producing a deficit of about $1.5 billion for 1997.</p>
