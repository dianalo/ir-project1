<p>Ousted Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani has agreed to appoint Uzbek militia leader Abdul Rashid Dostum as minister of defence and give Uzbeks more autonomy in the north, the international daily al-Hayat said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Arabic-language newspaper, which is based in London, said Rabbani told its reporter of the agreement at Pol-e-Khamri, a town 160 km (100 miles) north of the capital Kabul.</p>
<p>&quot;He said the agreement he signed with...Dostum specified his appointment as minister of defence in the mujahideen government. He acknowledged that he agreed with Dostum to give Uzbeks more independence in the north,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said Rabbani advised the Taleban militias to withdraw from Kabul immediately or else Rabbani and his allies would &quot;take appropriate measures&quot; to drive them out.</p>
<p>&quot;But we do not want to spill blood and would prefer that they withdraw peacefully,&quot; it quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The Taleban took control of Kabul two weeks ago but their rivals have been recapturing some of the territory the Taleban had taken north of the capital.</p>
<p>The Taleban's successes have driven former rivals together. In the agreement signed on Monday, Dostum agreed to recognise Rabbani's deposed government.</p>
<p>But al-Hayat quoted sources close to former prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as saying Hekmatyar had reservations about the new alliance agreements and could not go along with them.</p>
