<p>Key Asia-Pacific economies should take the lead in maintaining the worldwide push towards free trade at their annual summit later this month, a senior Australian government official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The official, who did not want to be named, said the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum summit in the Philippines should signal the members' commitment to freer trade at a time when other countries were backsliding.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting from our point of view is important because of what it can do in terms of keeping the momentum of trade liberalisation going at a global level,&quot; the official told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is, we can't assume that ... the momentum of trade liberalisation will continue globally -- in fact, the natural tendency is for that to slow down, if not be reversed.&quot;</p>
<p>APEC's 18 members are due to present their blueprint in Manila for achieving the group's historic free trade pact, struck in Indonesia in 1994.</p>
<p>That agreement commits developed APEC members to axing trade barriers by 2010, with developing economies doing so by 2020.</p>
<p>Australia has also expressed concern about backsliding on free trade gains under the Uruguay Round of trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</p>
<p>Ministers from the World Trade Organisation, which replaced GATT, are due to meet in Singapore next month for fresh talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone was looking for a breather,&quot; the Australian official said, &quot;but obviously it's in our interest to try to get the dynamic moving again.</p>
<p>&quot;APEC offers a very good opportunity to do that because the APEC members are probably amongst the most committed liberalisers -- they still see it as being very much in their own economic interest to continue the process of liberalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;This helps at a time when other parts of the world may be not so keen.&quot;</p>
<p>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.</p>
