<p>Thai telecommunication firm Jasmine International Plc said on Wednesday it would not be affected by the central bank's baht flotation as all its foreign loans were hedged.</p>
<p>In a filing to the Stock Exchange of Thailand, Jasmine said foreign currency-denominated loans by the company and its affiliates totalled $367 million.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand announced earlier that it intended a &quot;managed float&quot; of the Thai baht and said the value of the baht would be set by market forces instead of being pegged to a basket of currencies.</p>
<p>Analysts said the central bank's move to float the baht was a de facto devaluation.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Thai Telephone and Telecommunication Plc, which is majority owned by Jasmine, said a partial portion of its foreign loans totalling $353 million had been hedged against foreign exchange risk.</p>
<p>Of total foreign loans, $200 million had been covered by the option with a financial institution, Thai Telephone said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, only $153 million loans would be affected by the central bank's move,&quot; it said.</p>
