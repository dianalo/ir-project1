<p>The U.S. trade deficit shot up in December on record imports, driving the shortfall on total goods and services trade for all of 1996 to an eight-year peak, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The December deficit climbed 29.6 percent to $10.29 billion from a revised $7.94 billion in November, bringing the total 1996 trade gap to $114.23 billion -- an 8.7 percent jump from 1995 and the highest since a $115.5 billion shortfall in 1988.</p>
<p>Soaring costs for imported oil pushed up both the December and full-year 1996 deficit figures, while weak overseas economies provided a less buoyant market for American-made products in December.</p>
<p>The department said the U.S. trade deficit, excluding petroleum, declined last year for the first time in four years, to $107.79 billion from $111.72 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>The December deficit exceeded Wall Street economists' expectations of a $9.9 billion shortfall. Previously, the department said the November deficit was $8.4 billion, but it revised that downward.</p>
<p>&quot;This number is nothing exciting. Combined with the downward revision to November's deficit, this data was about what the Commerce Department assumed in its fourth-quarter GDP report,&quot; said John Ryding, managing director and senior economist at Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc.</p>
<p>Overall imports during December grew by 1.5 percent to a record $81.68 billion, while exports declined 1.6 percent to $71.4 billion.</p>
<p>During December, crude petroleum imports jumped 13.3 percent in value to $4.66 billion as the price per barrel increased to $21.65 from $21.44 in November.</p>
<p>Capital goods imports, including computers and telecommunications equipment, grew by $464 million in December to $19.55 billion. Imports of consumer goods also were up, possibly in part because of late stocking for the Christmas holiday season, by $525 million to $15.28 billion.</p>
<p>The politically sensitive deficit with Japan decreased by 1.2 percent to $4.27 billion in December while the shortfall with China was down 11.7 percent to $2.65 billion.</p>
<p>For the full year, however, the deficit with China totalled $39.52 billion and was second only to the $47.68 billion deficit  posted with Japan.</p>
<p>During December, the deficit on trade with Canada soared 32.8 percent to $2.32 billion in December while the gap with Western Europe shot up 48.7 percent to $2.05 billion.</p>
<p>In trade with oil-producing OPEC countries, the United States posted a December deficit of $1.89 billion, up 28.7 percent from $1.47 billion in November.</p>
<p>The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits.</p>
<p>In December, the merchandise deficit swelled 16.2 percent to $16.58 billion and hit a record $187.62 billion for all of 1996. The surplus on services fell 0.7 percent to $6.29 billion in the month but for the full year was a record $73.39 billion.</p>
<p>In trade with Mexico, the United States had a $667 million deficit in December, down sharply by 56 percent from the shortfall of $1.52 billion recorded in November.</p>
<p>Before the report was released, analysts said a strong dollar that made U.S. exports more expensive for foreigners, together with economic weakness among key trade partners in Europe and Japan, might keep the U.S. monthly deficit at lofty levels for much of 1997.</p>
<p>The dollar rose more than 8 percent against the German mark and almost 12 percent against the Japanese yen last year. It has continued to surge early this year, although economists note there is generally a lag between its appreciation and any measureable impact on trade.</p>
