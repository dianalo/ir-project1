<p>Sweden's S-E-Banken could be split down the middle into investment and retail banking and then merged rather than merged wholly with another bank, sector analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Over two months since merger talks between S-E-Banken and state-controlled Nordbanken collapsed, the market was still expecting further restructuring in the Swedish finance sector, with all eyes on S-E-Banken for its next move.</p>
<p>&quot;A solution would be to divide S-E-Banken in two and merge the retail banking with Nordbanken and the investment banking operations with a foreign bank, either an investment bank or a foreign bank which also has other operations,&quot; Fredrik Myren, analyst at HSBC James Capel, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A division and merger could boost share prices although much of the action was already discounted, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both Nordbanken's and S-E-Banken's shares would rise but S-E-Banken's would rise more,&quot; said Goran Kallebo, analyst at Matteus brokerage.</p>
<p>Speculation about a merger between S-E-Banken and Nordbanken took off last autumn with S-E-Banken shares leaping 48 percent from September 25 and Nordbanken's shares surging 52 percent, against a general index advance of 30 percent.</p>
<p>On Monday S-E-Banken was trading at 81 crowns and Nordbanken at 257 crowns.</p>
<p>The latest speculation began when Claes Dahlback, chief executive of the powerful Wallenberg family's investment company Investor, said he wanted his company to take a firmer grip on S-E-Banken's asset management.</p>
<p>Investor has doubled its S-E-Banken stake to 9.2 percent of capital this year and Dahlback is joining the bank's board.</p>
<p>Dahlback last week said S-E-Banken's retail banking needed a partner and emphasised its investment banking was profitable but needed a larger network to met international competition.</p>
<p>&quot;If you listen to Claes Dahlback he finds asset management interesting and the Wallenbergs, or Investor, are mainly interested in owning Enskilda, S-E-Banken's investment banking operations, and the bank's asset management,&quot; Myren said.</p>
<p>Analysts agree that S-E-Banken would transfer its asset management to its investment banking unit before a split.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is a connection between asset management and retail banking as branch offices are used for distribution,&quot; Myren said.</p>
<p>&quot;If Enskilda cuts the ties to S-E-Banken, it needs either to sign a distribution contract with the bank or to find an alternative distribution form or change in strategy because it won't have the same opportunity to reach individuals.&quot;</p>
<p>The Wallenbergs could merge Enskilda with a well-known investment bank or a large international bank with both investment and retail banking, Myren said.</p>
<p>But Kallebo suggested the investment banking business could be listed and run by the Wallenbergs who treat S-E-Banken like a family bank as a Wallenberg founded its core in 1856.</p>
<p>Myren did not expect the Wallenbergs to be sentimental after recently stressing shareholder value and return.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is value you want, it does not matter if you own a small stake,&quot; Myren said.</p>
<p>Kallebo expected the banks to move fairly quickly as there are large synergies to be gained on updating computer systems ahead of the turn of the century and ahead of Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU), set to start in 1999.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Finance Ministry has said that the sale of the government's 59 percent stake in Nordbanken this year was included in the April 15 spring budget proposal.</p>
<p>A sale would give the government roughly 28 billion crowns as Nordbanken's market capitalisation currently amounts to 46.8 billion crowns, while S-E-Banken's is 42.6 billion crowns.</p>
