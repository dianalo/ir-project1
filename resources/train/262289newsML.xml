<p>Leading stories in the Greek general press:</p>
<p>KATHIMERINI</p>
<p>--The damage to the economy caused by the continuing farmers' blockade is estimated to have cost 170 billion drachmas and left deep wounds that will take time to heal. Despite the lifting and relaxation of a number of road blocks around the country, the inclination of farmers in Thessaly to hold out and yesterday's announcement of a 48-hour strike at ports has worsened the situation. Prime Minister Costas Simitis reiterated again last night that the government would not give in as long as the blockades remained.</p>
<p>--Labour unrest comes to a head today, with the 24-hour strike by the public service and a three-hour work stoppage by the private sector, coinciding with the beginning of the discussion of the 1997 budget in Parliament.</p>
<p>--Attention turns to Parliament today as the five-day discussion of the budget begins. The Saturday night roll-call vote is considered to be an informal vote of confidence for the government's policies.</p>
<p>--Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and conservative opposition New Democracy leader Miltiades Evert responded yesterday to threatening statements by Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, embittered by her failure to persuade the European Union of the rightness of Turkey's campaign to become a member of the EU. At the same time, the International Federation of Journalists reported that Turkey came first worldwide in jailing reporters.</p>
<p>--US President Bill Clinton yesterday called on Athens and Ankara to reconsider their stance on bilateral relations for the sake of regional security. Clinton gave a personal commitment to work to improve Greek-Turkish relations and resolve the Cyprus issue.	</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROTYPIA</p>
<p>--The objective pricing system for real estate and property is to be extended throughout the country, the finance ministry announced yesterday. The ministry says its prices are about 15-25 percent lower than market values.</p>
<p>--A new opinion poll by MRB shows main opposition New Democracy leading ruling PASOK by 28.3 percent over 26.6 percent, just three months after the elections and despite widely-publicised squabbling in the ND ranks. A resounding 75.8 percent say that the government's economic measures are unfair.</p>
<p>--The winners in the new poll are the Coalition of the Left and Progress (5.6 percent over 5.2 at the September 22 elections) and the Democratic Social Movement (6.2 compared to 4.4). Coalition leader Nikos Constantopoulos remains the most popular politician while Simitis's popularity takes a dive from 49.7 percent in June to 37.9 percent.  </p>
<p>TA NEA</p>
<p>--Farmers continuing to block the nation's road and rail links will descend on Athens on Thursday, bringing their families with them to Parliament and the prime minister's offices. The road blocks, however, will remain.</p>
<p>ETHNOS</p>
<p>--The latest poll indicates that Greeks are all for European unification but critical of how it is being achieved. The most popular politician who is not a leader of a party is Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos. </p>
<p>--Greece's Miss World Irene Skliva returned home yesterday for the first time since winning the title and criticised the decision of an Athens magazine to publish nude photos taken six months ago. Skliva is due to meet President Kostis Stephanopoulos today.</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROS TYPOS</p>
<p>--A priest in Drama has provoked an outcry after refusing to to conduct a funeral service for a woman who was married in a civil ceremony.</p>
<p>--Greece's 50,000 policemen will submit source of wealth statements as of March. Instances of corruption will be dealt with by the courts immediately. --Maria Petrakis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
