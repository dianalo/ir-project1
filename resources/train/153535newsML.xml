<p>Mass. Sen. John Kerry and his challenger Gov. William Weld each picked up the endorsements of a high-profile politician and a Boston newspaper Wednesday as two new polls showed the race remains a statistical dead heat.</p>
<p>Texas billionaire Ross Perot took his faltering presidential campaign to Boston's Faneuil Hall where he told an enthusiastic crowd he backs the Republican Governor in the Senate race, one of the closest in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We need people like Bill Weld in Washington today. Governor Weld is not a partisan politician; he is a doer,&quot; Perot told about 100 people.</p>
<p>Weld thanked Perot for his support, but told reporters later he would vote next Tuesday for Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole.</p>
<p>&quot;That's fine. He's a Republican,&quot; Perot told reporters when asked about Weld's vote.</p>
<p>The Kerry campaign quickly countered by announcing former Senator Paul Tsongas, who ran unsuccessfully for the presidential nomination in 1992, would back his successor, John Kerry.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that standing with Paul Tsongas this afternoon ... is a lot better way to terminate a campaign than standing with Ross Perot,&quot; Kerry told reporters.</p>
<p>The Weld campaign filed a complaint in Suffolk Superior Court, charging that Kerry breached a contract by exceeding an agreed-upon $500,000 limit on personal contributions by a candidate to the campaign.</p>
<p>Kerry, the richest member of Congress following his marriage last year to the heiress of the Heinz food processing fortune, has thrown $1.25 million into his campaign, the Weld camp said.</p>
<p>Two polls released Wednesday showed a statistical dead heat. Kerry, who won the endorsement of the Boston Globe on Wednesday, has a 46 percent to 42 percent lead over Weld, within the survey's five percent margin of error, according to a poll by the Boston Herald and WCVB-TV.</p>
<p>A Boston Globe poll showed Kerry leading by 44 percent to 38 percent for Weld, who picked up the endorsement of the Boston Herald Wednesday. That survey of 400 voters also has a five percent margin of error.</p>
<p>Both surveys were conducted late Monday and Tuesday after Monday's debate, the eighth and last face-off between the two.</p>
