<p>*********</p>
<p>HAMBURG - Hamburg-based advertising agency Scholz &amp; Friends says it aims to expand its international network and have a significant group role following its merger into the British-based Bates.</p>

<p>*********</p>
<p>BERLIN - The Sat.1 commercial television channel has put the Hamburg-based Wilkens agency in charge of its advertising account following its move in February to cancel its contract with Jung von Matt, also based in Hamburg.</p>
<p>***********************************************</p>
<p>MEDIA &amp; THE INTERNET:</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's Independent Television Commission says it plans to limit the use of branding by broadcasters on electronic programme guides (EPGs). The ITC published its code of conduct on EPGs, which are remote control guides helping viewers navigate through the 200-odd channels expected in the next few years with the arrival of digital television.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>BONN - German parliament passes legislation that will allow government regulation of the Internet and set the stage for the development of new multimedia services in business and entertainment. The law sets standards for child protection in cyberspace and defines which activities require regulation and which can be operated without any formal license or regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>TOKYO - Japanese distributors say they have indefinitely postponed the release of &quot;Scream&quot;, a blockbuster U.S. teen slasher film, because people in Japan have been so upset by the killing and beheading of an 11-year-old schoolboy in the town of Kobe.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>BONN - Interior minister Manfred Kanther has urged public broadcasters to reduce the amount of violence shown on television. The call follows official statistics showing a 12-percent increase in crimes by children in 1996.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's impending handover to China got you down? Tired of that nostalgia for empire? Bored by Britain and Beijing? Get with it. Get wired.

Check out scores of World Wide Web sites on Hong Kong, including the Reuters site at http://www.hk97.com.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES - Time Warner Inc. Vice Chairman Ted Turner says he plans to follow the lead of the Home Box Office cable station by converting the Turner cable stations to digital high-definition format &quot;as quickly as we can&quot;.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>HAMBURG - The owners of German pay-television channels Premiere und DF1 are close to signing a cooperation pact, news magazine Der Spiegel reports.

<p>*********</p>

<p>*********</p>

<p>***********************************************</p>
<p>BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS &amp; MARKETS:</p>
<p>NEW YORK - The $750 million market for drugs and devices to help people stop smoking could easily double within two years if a key proposal in tobacco settlement talks is accepted, industry analysts say. Health groups, state attorneys general and lawyers for smokers suing tobacco companies have suggested that the tobacco industry be required to finance programmes for smokers who want to quit.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Philips Electronics, which over the last two years has slashed its network of about 40 advertising agencies to just two, has a unique chance to forge ahead with a global strategy based on the strength of its brand, analysts say.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>LONDON - LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton says it requests arbitration from the International Chamber of Commerce over its dispute with Guinness Plc, relating to the proposed merger of Guinness with Grand Metropolitan Plc.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>NEW YORK - Some of the world's biggest personal computer makers plan to join Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to unveil new machines called NetPCs that are meant to lower the cost of corporate computer networks. Compaq Computer Corp., International Business Machines Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Mitsubishi Corp., and others are expected to unveil scaled-down, diskless PCs designed as lower-cost devices for corporate networks.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>TOKYO - Corporate Japan, which tops the list of direct investors in Hong Kong, expects business as usual after the British colony returns to China at the end of this month. But Tokyo will be watching closely to see whether -- and for how long -- Beijing preserves the free-wheeling atmosphere that has made Hong Kong a major magnet for Japanese money.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>VANCOUVER, British Columbia - British Columbia is set to announce legislation paving the way for the province to sue tobacco companies to recoup medical costs for treating smokers, people familiar with the plan say. The move would make British Columbia the first province in Canada and possibly the first government outside the United States to pursue such action, similar to the approach taken by 37 U.S. states, legal experts say.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>BEIJING - China's output of bicycles is expected to reach 41 million a year by 2000, the Market Daily says. Exports of bicycles would climb to 10 million a year by 2000, the newspaper reports. China, which produced fewer than 30 million bicyles in 1996, has forecast its demand for bicycles in 1997 at 32 million.</p>
<p>***********************************************</p>
<p>CONSUMER TRENDS:</p>
<p>CHICAGO - Chicago's free-wheeling futures traders are waiting eagerly to sink their teeth into what promises to be a tasty new commodity -- hamburger futures. Andy Gottschalk, livestock analyst with LFG LLC, predicts active use of the contracts from anyone in the ground beef business seeking price protection. The group includes cattle ranchers, beef packers and meat processors, supermarket chains and retail stores, and restaurants, says Tim Brennan, a governor at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange which is listing the new contracts.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>LONDON - Chocolate maker and cocoa bean processor Barry Callebaut says it plans to open a chocolate college in Lodz, Poland this year to help lay the foundations for further chocolate consumption growth in that region. &quot;We're now also investing in a college in Poland,&quot; said Onno Bleeker, executive director of industrial sales and development. &quot;Why? Because we want to educate people on how to use chocolate.&quot; Barry Callebaut already has six schools worldwide in France, Belgium, Italy, the United States, Canada and Singapore.</p>
