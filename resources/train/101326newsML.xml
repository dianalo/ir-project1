<p>Foreign companies expecting huge profits in hooking up the Asian telecommunications market may end up severely disappointed, a report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Asia is not the pot at the end of the telecommunications rainbow that many foreign companies hope it will be,&quot; said the latest report by Asian Intelligence, a publication of the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;Even talking in terms of the emerging Asian telecommunications market is deceiving. Asia is a collection of countries with very different situations with respect to their telecommunications industries,&quot; said the report made available over the weekend.</p>
<p>Liberalisation of the telecommunications industry is proceeding in almost every Asian country from Indonesia to China, but reform &quot;is not being greeted with great enthusiasm&quot; by many of the companies who dominate the market in the region.</p>
<p>The list of players includes China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd, Korea Mobile Telecom Corp and Taiwan's Directorate General of Communications.</p>
<p>&quot;All are determined to hold onto as much domestic market share as possible,&quot; Asian Intelligence said, adding their tactics range from Singapoe's aggressive international positioning to MPT's use of &quot;its political clout to make life difficult for potential competitors.&quot;</p>
<p>Telecommunications reform in Asia will not be as smooth as many in the industry had hoped for or as the public was led to believe, it said.</p>
<p>Companies like China's MPT and Indonesia's PT Telecom, aside from the political influence they already possess, are adroit at using bureaucratic inertia in their governments to keep the competition off-balance.</p>
<p>&quot;Even when rules are changed officially, it is easy for the larger, established companies to refuse to cooperate with newcomers in ways that delay their expansion plans and push up investment costs of new entrants,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Intense competition, especially in the mobile phone business, is also eating away the profit margins of the biggest suppliers in the business hoping to cash in at the increasing demand for telephones in Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;Major deals seem to be announced on almost a daily basis (in China), but only a few companies are making really big money,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>While MPT has been willing to give ground on marginal areas like paging, it has held firm in core businesses like fixed line communications and control of international gateway facilities that process overseas calls.</p>
<p>In fact, getting into the fixed-line business is tough and politically tricky.</p>
<p>&quot;The MPT will fight tooth and nail to defend its interests in this business, although its new domestic rival, Liantong, is trying to lay down an optical fibre network that will give it an alternative backbone system in the future,&quot; the report added.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, the handing out of some regional telecommunications contracts recently encouraged some analysts to suggest that Jakarta is now willing to put aside its usual preference for politically well-connected companies.</p>
