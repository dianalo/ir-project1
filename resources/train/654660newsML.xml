<p>The European Commission, anxious to ensure fair competition across the English Channel, said on Wednesday it had strong doubts about a joint venture between ferry giants P&amp;O and Stena Line.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission has informed P&amp;O and Stena that it has serious doubts as to whether their proposal to combine their cross-Channel ferry services can be cleared under EC competition rules,&quot; the EU executive said in a statement.</p>
<p>However, this did not &quot;rule out the possibility that the proposed joint venture will ultimately receive clearance,&quot; it said, adding that the Commission would continue its investigation before coming to a final ruling.</p>
<p>By sending a so-called &quot;letter of serious doubts&quot;, the Commission is signalling to Britain's P&amp;O and Sweden's Stena that they must agree to conditions in order to win regulatory approval for their venture.</p>
<p>If it had not been sent by Wednesday, the deal would automatically have been exempted from EU competition rules for six years.</p>
<p>P&amp;O, the Peninsular and Orient Navigation Company, and Stena plan to merge operations across the Channel, notably on the lucrative Dover-Calais route where they will run tourist services approximately every 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The merged company would compete mainly with Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel Plc.</p>
<p>EU sources said it is now up to Stena and P&amp;O to come back with comments or proposals on how to ease the Commission's competition concerns. There is no deadline for a final decision.</p>
<p>However, both firms said they remained confident of getting Commission approval for their plans. Stena said it hoped to receive a &quot;letter of comfort&quot; giving the go-ahead for the deal in early July.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been keeping in close touch with Commission officials and this is very much what we expected. I am confident we will be able to meet the points they have raised,&quot; said P&amp;O chairman Lord Sterling.</p>
<p>EU sources said the Commission had raised a number of concerns in its letter, for example on the combined strength of the Stena/P&amp;O venture and Eurotunnel's Le Shuttle, the car-train service through the Channel Tunnel.</p>
<p>Their share of the cross-Channel traffic is estimated at 80 percent or more. There are also three other, smaller operators.</p>
<p>P&amp;O's statement said that the Commission had essentially accepted the merger arguments for the freight market, which would continue to see intense competition. But the Commission was more concerned about the short sea tourist market.</p>
<p>Therefore, it wanted to examine the need to keep the operations of the merged company separate from the operations of the parent groups, P&amp;O said. It would also look into how the tourist services are promoted and sold in brochures.</p>
<p>&quot;These are important issues for the regulator to be clear about. But on the commercial side of the merger it would have little impact,&quot; Peter Smith, director of corporate affairs at P&amp;O, told Reuters in London.</p>
