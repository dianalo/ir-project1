<p>Robust foreign demand for American-made aircraft and other goods narrowed the U.S. trade deficit sharply in March as it gave the economy added impetus, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The shortfall between exports and imports tumbled 19 percent from February to $8.51 billion, the smallest gap since $7.97 billion last November. The closely watched bilateral deficit with China was the lowest in nearly a year.</p>
<p>Analysts said the better-than-expected March performance meant the U.S. economy was churning forward at an even brisker first-quarter pace than previously thought, straining to meet orders.</p>
<p>&quot;It smells like 6 percent,&quot; said Commerce Undersecretary Everett Ehrlich, referring to a likely upward revision in the annual rate of growth in first-quarter gross domestic product.</p>
<p>That would represent a pickup from the already vigorous 5.6 percent rate of first-quarter expansion in GDP reported a month ago.</p>
<p>During March total exports increased 4.1 percent from February to a record $76.48 billion. Imports grew by a more modest 1.2 percent from February to $84.99 billion, also a record, kept in check by a lower value of imported cars and parts, primarily from Canada.</p>
<p>The contraction in the deficit occurred despite a higher-valued dollar that made U.S. goods more costly for foreigners to buy and amid relatively lackluster overseas economies in Japan and much of Western Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;We produce the goods that the rest of the world wants, particularly in high-tech and aircraft,&quot; economist Mike Fenollosa of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. said.</p>
<p>&quot;What's more we are able to sell them even though the dollar is high and foreign economies are struggling,&quot; he added, so the export picture should brighten further if foreign economies improve.</p>
<p>A day after the Clinton administration announced it was extending China's most-favored-nation trading status, the Commerce Department said the March bilateral deficit with the Asian trade dynamo plummeted 22.4 percent to $2.59 billion -- the lowest since $2.3 billion in April last year.</p>
<p>But the deficit with Japan swelled to $4.61 billion, an 8.3 percent increase from February's $4.26 billion gap.</p>
<p>Persistent deficits with Japan seem unending.</p>
<p>In April numbers released on Monday, Tokyo said that its bilateral surplus with the United States more than doubled last month, on a year-over-year basis, largely because of surging exports. Japan's exports have been fueled by a weaker yen that makes its goods attractive in foreign markets.</p>
<p>Ehrlich indicated the Clinton administration wants more action from Japan to curb its supluses, especially since new consumption taxes on April 1 may dampen Japanese consumers' taste for imports.</p>
<p>&quot;Our concern ... is that Japan will revert to a pattern of allowing the rest of the world to pull it out of a cyclical downturn,&quot; Ehrlich said.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said the February deficit was $10.42 billion. But it revised that up to $10.54 billion.</p>
<p>The cost of imported crude oil fell for a second consecutive month during March, down 4 percent to $4.38 billion, as the price per barrel eased to $18.72 from $20.49 in February and from $22.03 in January.</p>
<p>The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism, which partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits.</p>
<p>In March the merchandise deficit fell 11.4 percent from February to $15.06 billion. The surplus on services climbed 1.3 percent to $6.56 billion.</p>
<p>In trade with Mexico, the United States posted a deficit of $1.47 billion in March, more than a 20 percent jump from February's $1.2 billion shortfall.</p>
<p>The United States had a smaller surplus on trade with Western Europe of $320 million in March, compared with $330 million in February.</p>
<p>Foreign sales of civilian aircraft jumped strongly in March to $2.46 billion from $1.72 billion in February. Commerce officials said much of the gain was accounted for by stronger sales to South Korea and to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Imports of autos and parts from all sources fell by $1.22 billion to $11.09 billion in March from $12.31 billion in February while consumer goods imports eased by $98 million to $15.14 billion.</p>
