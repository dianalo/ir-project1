<p>Hong Kong stocks look set for further consolidation in the week ahead after a government move last week to curb real estate prices left investors fearing further clamps on the property market.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government said it would extend the presale period for private flats to 15 months from a current 12 months to bring more supply to the market. It also said developers would have to put presale flats on to the market within six months of the date of consent and release a &quot;reasonable quantity&quot; each time.</p>
<p>&quot;This policy is making people concerned about the future policy of the government -- whether they will make another move,&quot; said Sunny Chan, senior research manager at Seapower Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short and medium term the property market will still be a focus,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index rose 45.02 points, or 0.36 percent, last week but ended the abbreviated four-day week on a shaky note on Thursday, tumbling 242.07 points or 1.89 percent to 12,534.32.</p>
<p>The market was closed on Friday for the Good Friday holiday and will be closed on Monday for the Easter Monday holiday.</p>
<p>Property stocks led last week's decline despite posting strong earnings growth for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;What the government is doing is positive from the end-user point of view but negative for the developers,&quot; said Eric Yuen, a property analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research.</p>
<p>Analysts said property developers would be restricted in their pricing strategies. Some tend to release flats for sale in small batches, increasing the price for each new batch.</p>
<p>However, Percy Au-Young, director of research at DBS Securities, said developers' earnings should not be hurt.</p>
<p>&quot;For 1997 and 1998, most developers will be able to show a very good performance. They don't need to rely on further increases in prices. Their costs are very low and the profit margin is more than 50 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he saw the market trading in a narrow range in the week ahead. &quot;Most people would like to take a wait-and-see approach. I think the market is still looking for support,&quot; said Au-Young, adding that he saw a range of 12,300 to 13,000 points.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a certain amount of nervousness out there,&quot; added Miles Remington, sales trader at SocGen-Crosby Securities.</p>
<p>He said 12,800 points should prove to be a strong resistance level for the Hang Seng Index with support at 12,200.</p>
<p>Remington said that after last week's 25 basis point rise in the U.S. federal funds rate and similar moves in Hong Kong rates, the market would become more susceptible to economic data, looking for signs of another 25 basis point rise.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is going to be a lot of uncertainty over the next two months with U.S. interest rates and property. It is not going to be great,&quot; said Archie Hart, a director at BZW Asia.</p>
