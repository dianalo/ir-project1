<headline>Sudan paper says Egypt tortures, deports 4 students.</headline>
<dateline>KHARTOUM 1996-11-24</dateline>

<p>A privately-owned Khartoum daily said on Sunday that Egypt had tortured and deported four southern Sudanese students and detained 24 others because they belonged to rebel factions loyal to Sudan's Islamist-government.</p>
<p>Akhbar al-Youm quoted Reverend Idi Ambrose, the deputy president of the human rights committee at the parliament, as saying the Egyptian authorities denied the students food and water for several weeks, exposing them to all sorts of torture.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Interior Ministry said it did not have any information about the detention or deportation of the students.</p>
<p>&quot;The committee has...strongly denounced the conduct of the Egyptian regime towards these students,&quot; Ambrose was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He said the students were members of two factions which broke away from the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), fighting for more than a decade for autonomy of the mainly Christian and animist south.</p>
<p>The two factions, led by Riak Machar and Cerbuino Bol, signed in April peace deals with the Khartoum goverment and the daily said the Egyptian authorities had tortured the students to make them recant their &quot;peace-oriented&quot; beliefs.</p>
<p>Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained since gunmen tried to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia last year.</p>
<p>Egypt, which accuses Sudan of harbouring and training the Moslem militants trying to topple the Cairo government, says three of the gunmen are hiding in Sudan. But Khartoum says they are not within its borders.</p>
