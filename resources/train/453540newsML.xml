<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>

<p>Dutch bonds ended slightly lower on Wednesday, largely shrugging off U.S. CPI data, but remaining nervous after the consistent market weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the corrections of the last couple of days, economic data are gaining in importance. More than usual, market players remain sidelined until they've seen the figures,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>German February M3 data, released this morning were somewhat better than expected, giving a positive undertone to the market.</p>
<p>Wednesday's U.S. February CPI figures were, by contrast, initially ignored. The 0.3 percent increase was above the forecasted 0.2 percent rise.  </p>
<p>Dealers noted some lengthening of positions, with trade there above average. But bonds did slip towards the close. Jan 2023s closed down 10 basis points at 112.35/55.</p>
<p>Dealers disagreed about the future market direction.</p>
<p>&quot;I think market players haven't realised until now the market trend has turned. Interest rates have gone down since 1991, but that's come to an end now,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;A U.S. interest rate hike doesn't seem needed at the moment. Looking at the misery in France and Germany, I think prospects for the bond market are quite good for the coming months,&quot; said another by way of contrast.  </p>
<p>Talk also grew about a rise in Dutch rates as the guilder weakened slightly against the German mark.</p>
<p>&quot;They could do it, they still have 0.10 percent of room left,&quot; one dealer said,</p>
<p>Another said there was no need for a hike as the guilder still stood far below its central ERM rate against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;They now have it (the guilder) where they want it, so they won't hike (rates). Only if the guilder moves towards 1.13 is there a problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Dutch central bank will announce a new special advances pact on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The special advances rate currently stands at 2.90 percent, ten basis points below its German equivalent. It rose from 2.50 percent on February 27, after the guilder had showed continued weakness versus the mark.</p>
