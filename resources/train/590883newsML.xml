<p>Connecticut's House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill designed to help would-be patients choose a health maintenance organization (HMO), Hartford Courant reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The bill, passed by a 144-1 vote, is the closest Connecticut has come to regulating the quality of treatment delivered by managed care plans.</p>
<p>The bill is expected to be approved because it also has substantial support in the Senate, the Courant said.</p>
<p>About 1.4 million Connecticut residents are insured through some sort of managed care plan.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers have voiced concerns that the bill was an example of over-regulation. But they said they still supported it because they recognized that improvements in patient care were necessary.</p>
<p>The bill represents a compromise between the state's powerful insurance industry, which opposes regulation of managed care, and physician and consumer groups who argue that managed care detracts from the quality of healthcare.</p>
