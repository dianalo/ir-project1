<text>
<p>British food and snack maker United Biscuits, freed of its money-losing Keebler arm in the United States, reported Thursday it had moved back into the black and said the first signs of recovery were coming through.</p>
<p>United Biscuits reported first half pre-tax profits, before one-time charges, of 44.9 million pounds ($69.8 million), up from 22.9 million ($35.8 million).</p>
<p>A charge of 60.7 million pounds ($94.8 million) in last year's first half was set aside to cover losses on the sale of businesses.</p>
<p>United Biscuits, maker of McVities biscuits and KP snacks, is striving to restore profit growth after ditching Keebler and a money-losing business in Spain last year at huge cost.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Eric Nicoli said the group had been through some financial pain in 1995 because of the restructuring, but first half results showed that investment in the remaining businesses was starting to pay off.</p>
