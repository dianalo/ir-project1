<p>The IAAF international athletics meeting in Sestriere next month could be cancelled if major sponsors do not come forward, organisers said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking for sponsors to cover the costs of this meeting,&quot; Livio Berruti, press officer for the company which manages the resort, said.</p>
<p>Berruti said sponsors were needed to finance a part of the one billion lire ($590,000) costs of the July 19 meeting, in the run up to August's World Championships in Athens, but he did not specify the exact amount of the shortfall.</p>
<p>He said a decision on the meeting's future would be made in the next few days.</p>
<p>Organisers have traditionally offered a Ferrari car for anyone breaking a world record at the meeting.</p>
<p>Italian newspapers reported on Monday that the resort was in a bad financial shape after hosting the Alpine skiing World Championships earlier this year.</p>
<p>Berruti denied the reports and said rising costs and lack of public support for development projects were the two main factors which put the athletics meeting at risk.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not had great help from outside. The costs are more each year but the finances don't always increase,&quot; he said.</p>
