<title>UK: Export woes keep Europe grains market in doldrums.</title>
<headline>Export woes keep Europe grains market in doldrums.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Slack export business to EU and non-EU destinations kept Europe's grains markets in the doldrums this week, traders said.</p>
<p>Denmark is still competing hard on wheat, hitting chances for UK exporters in Germany, while French wheat did well in Italy on poor German crop quality and the strength of sterling.</p>
<p>Indications that France might dig in its heels over imports of genetically modified U.S. maize helped bolster French maize.</p>
<p>France might insist the Monsanto maize be labelled separately before import - a requirement of environmentalists. This raised questions over U.S. maize imports to Spain and Portugal and sent some consumers to French maize for cover.</p>
<p>A French diplomat in Brussels said France would allow in the maize, following European Commission approval in December, but insist it be labelled. A timetable for that is not clear, nor is the impact it would have on other maize imports to Europe.</p>
<p>France has not officially disclosed its position but farm minister Philippe Vasseur has spoken about the merits of extra food labelling.</p>
<p>Iberia is a traditional &quot;swing&quot; destination for southwest French maize, depending heavily on the timing of preferential imports from the United States.</p>
<p>Some traders are said to have sold U.S. maize forward into Spain before getting licences for EU duty reductions, further putting the market on edge.</p>
<p>Benchmark maize was unchanged over the week at Bordeaux, though the gene maize speculation and renewed interest from starchers did put a floor under prices, traders said. Starchers are looking for maize due to quality problems north and east.</p>
<p>Central French maize gained on the internal demand.</p>
<p>French wheat and barley drifted lower after a lower EU export award than usual last week, disappointing the market and only partly offset by this week's exports.</p>
<p>Internal EU business was slack, though Italy remains the most popular EU destination for French wheat. France has benefited from disappointing German crop quality and the strength of sterling.</p>
<p>The weak tone in German milling wheat prices persists amid a lack of foreign (including EU) buying and as more grain emerges from farmer and co-operative storage.</p>
<p>British feed wheat is expensive (offered at 267.50 marks cif north Germany March-June), although German traders said Britain was selling elsewhere in southern and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Danish feed wheat exporters are keen to sell their surplus to Germany but they're having a hard time competing with cheap domestic supply from eastern Germany.</p>
<p>Feed wheat is dominating feed grain markets so that feed rye and feed barley prices are drifting closer towards intervention levels (February's  buying-in price is 241.25 marks a tonne)</p>
<p>There is also concern about the ongoing Polish grain tax discussion as it might damage Germany's export chances.</p>
<p>Price levels in the UK are still being set more by the foreign exchange than the grains market. The weakness of sterling helped futures to a rise Friday morning, but the effect is only feeding through slowly to the physical market.</p>
<p>&quot;It hasn't had a chance to filter through,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Even so the fall has helped push up a quiet market. Sterling has lost some ten pfennigs against the mark since January 22 and seen a similar fall against the franc, contributing to a rise in delivered prices.</p>
<p>UK wheat for export remains competitive against French supplies, but expensive against the Danish alternative. There is little exporting from the UK to other EU countries going on.</p>
<p>Higher prices could encourage farmers to hold on to stocks in the view that the market was one the way up, but traders were pessimistic for the longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;I think now it's showing a bit of strength farmers won't sell,&quot; one said. &quot;But in the longer term there are problems of disposal,&quot; he said. &quot;We're still heading for a surplus at the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>In Spain, widespread heavy rain has been delaying both maize harvesting in the north and wheat-sowing in the south, contributing to a pick-up in prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>Durum wheat has also been subject to strong demand from Italy and northern Europe, hence a sharp price rise.</p>
<p>&quot;With the market so tight and the problems with the weather I don't think its going to do us any good. It needs to stop raining,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Latest benchmark European grains prices (French prices exclude carrying charges, Italian prices are based on Thursday's Turin exchange prices and are on delivered basis, with durum prices based on Milan exchange).</p>
