<p>Nigeria's military government on Tuesday said it was shocked at young people's moral decadence and said it would set up a committee to try to improve their standards.</p>
<p>The head of the National Orientation Agency, Elo Amucheazi, told a news conference in the capital Abuja that Nigerian youths were indulging in drug dealing and abuse, murderous cult groups, burglary, armed robbery and prostitution.</p>
<p>&quot;If this disturbing trend is not checked and something drastic done to change the value systems of our youths the nation's future will be bleak,&quot; Amucheazi said.</p>
<p>He said the military would set up a high-powered committee to look into the decadent behaviour and find ways to reform it.</p>
<p>&quot;My agency has planned a systematic orientation programme for schools and universities that we hope will have a salutory effect,&quot; Amucheazi said.</p>
<p>He did not specify which youths would be able to take part, or what would happen to the many who are not in school because their families are too poor or unwilling to send them.</p>
<p>Nigeria's rulers have been shunned by many Western countries for alleged human rights abuses, holding dozens of political prisoners and being insincere about restoring power to civilians.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Africa's most populous nation has won a world reputation as a centre of fraud and the drug trade and was recently dubbed the most corrupt country to do business in a survey of 52 countries by Berlin-based watchdog Transparency International.</p>
<p>Parts of the country are virtual no-go areas after dark for fear of armed robbery.</p>
<p>Amucheazi said the indisciplined behaviour of some of their elders, the extravagant lifestyles of rich Nigerians and the poor economic health of the country should not be taken by youths as excuses for their own misdeeds.</p>
<p>&quot;We should not regard these as excuses, but rather consider how to address them,&quot; said Amucheazi. &quot;We need an improved economy and pattern of resource distribution to provide our youths with opportunities to let out steam.&quot;</p>
<p>Nigeria has been in political and economic crisis since 1993, when a former military government annulled elections that would have ended a decade of army rule.</p>
<p>At the weekend a hero for much of Nigerian youth, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, died of AIDS. The Afrobeat musician had a reputation for openly smoking marijuana and sleeping with hundreds of women.</p>
