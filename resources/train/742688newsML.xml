<p>Argentine bonds were slightly lower in a very calm market in early trading Monday, with attention focused on Tuesday's speech before Congress by U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very calm, with very thin volume,&quot; a dealer for one major local bank said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the high volatility seen last week, on fears that Brazil might devalue its real currency, was over.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is the calm after the storm,&quot; he said. &quot;There is wide consensus now both in the international and domestic markets that Brazil will not devalue the Real.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that Argentine bond spreads were very wide and there may still some way down to go Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>The FRB Brady bond due 2005 was slightly lower a $93.75 after having closed Friday at $93.875 while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 was trading at at $118.20 against a previous close of $118.25.</p>
