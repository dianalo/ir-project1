<p>World championship leader Colin McRae and Spaniard Carlos Sainz both retired from the Rally of Portugal on Monday.</p>
<p>Sainz, who was celebrating his 10th anniversary in world championship rallying, had been in contention with the leaders during the opening stages of the day but encountered gearbox problems on the fifth stage.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything was going fine in the stage and it would have been a good time but just two kilometres from the end there was a big bang in the transmission,&quot; said the 34-year-old Spaniard, who lies second in the championship table, behind McRae.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe something in the gearbox tried to seize but there was nothing we could do and I was forced to park the car.&quot;</p>
<p>Briton McRae had been leading the rally after the fifth stage but his Subaru stopped near the end of the sixth stage. Although he was able to push the car to the end of the stage, he did not reach the service point in time and was forced to drop out.</p>
<p>The retirements mean that Subaru's Kenneth Eriksson from Sweden leads the event after six stages and should he go on to win he would take the lead in the world championship standings.</p>
