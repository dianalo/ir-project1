<headline>Taiwan February gold imports up 22.57 pct y/y.</headline>

<p>Taiwan's imports of gold bars, coins and plate rose 22.57 percent to 9.785 tonnes in February from 7.983 tonnes a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the February import jump to falling world gold prices and a domestic economic recovery.</p>
<p>Taiwan March gold imports were expected to fall due to rising international gold prices and a slowing of local buying interest in the wake of the mid-February Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, typically a period of high demand, dealers said.</p>
<p>Taiwan gold dealers said imports from South Korea were mainly from transshipments.</p>
<p>Many major Korean firms made speculative gold transshipments before the South Korean government began cracking down on the practice in July 1996.</p>
<p>Typically, South Korean bullion houses imported gold on 90- to 120-day deferred payments, then immediately exported the gold at a slight discount and put the proceeds in high-interest money market instruments that more than made up for the discounts.</p>
<p>Significant profits could be made by exploiting the gap between South Korea's interest rates and London's Interbank Offered Rate and re-export tax breaks.  </p>
<p>But on July 1, Seoul shortened the deferred payment period to a maximum of 30 days, instantly chilling what had been a booming transshipment business.</p>
<p>Taiwan traders said some scattered trading still existed in South Korea, but on a much smaller scale.</p>
<p>The ministry said Taiwan's gold exports in February remained modest at 0.284 tonnes, up from 0.375 tonnes in February 1995.  </p>
<p>Taiwan's main gold suppliers in February were as follows (in tonnes):</p>
<p> Country	     February 1997	 February 1996</p>
<p> Switzerland		   3.674		   2.281</p>
<p> South Korea		   2.079		   0.998</p>
<p> Britain			 1.653		   0.481</p>
<p> Hong Kong		     0.537		   0.514</p>
