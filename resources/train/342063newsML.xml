<title>NORWAY: Elf cuts reserves estimates at Froey field - Hydro.</title>
<headline>Elf cuts reserves estimates at Froey field - Hydro.</headline>
<dateline>OSLO 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Elf Petroleum Norge AS, as operator of the North Sea Frigg oil and gas area, has downgraded estimates of recoverable oil reserves at the Froey oil field by 59 percent to 5.9 million cubic metres, or 37 million barrels, Norsk Hydro ASA said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Original estimates in the plan for operation and development were 14.3 million cubic metres, or nearly 90 million barrels.  </p>
<p>Hydro said in a statement that it would make provisions and write down the carrying value of assets in the Frigg area by 600 million crowns ($91.7 million), to be booked in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>The net result after deferred taxes would be a charge of 132 million crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;This has a negative impact on both the value of Froey and the overall profitability of the Frigg area, because the oil from Froey is processed at Frigg prior to transportation through Frostpipe and the Oseberg Transport System,&quot; Hydro said.</p>
<p>It said it had reduced the carrying value of assets in the Lille-Frigg and Froey fields by 400 million crowns. At the same time it had raised provisions for future costs related to workforce reductions, closure and the removal of installations in the Frigg area by 200 million crowns.</p>
<p>Previously Hydro has recorded two other writedowns tied to the Frigg area, one of 755 million crowns in the second quarter of 1995 and a further 400 million crowns in the third quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Hydro owns 6.05 percent interest in Froey and 32.87 percent in the Lille-Frigg field and in the Norwegian part of the Frigg field.</p>
