<p>Brazilian striker Anderson has a score to settle with English soccer when Monaco clash with Newcastle United in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year against Leeds in the first round, we lost 3-0 at home and despite our good performance in the away leg the die was already cast and I played with an injury,&quot; Anderson said after practice on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;This time things will be different and Monaco have already done well in the competition.&quot;</p>
<p>Anderson is not, however, taking anything for granted as Monaco prepare to travel to Newcastle next week for the first leg against a side deprived through injury of England captain Alan Shearer.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't play against Metz (in the first leg of the previous round) and that didn't prevent Newcastle from qualifying,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
<p>&quot;We know they've fallen a bit behind in the league championship and they have big ambitions in the UEFA Cup. We know they'll be wary of us because they know we've eliminated two German sides.</p>
<p>&quot;They'll play a prestige match against us and, having changed trainer, they have things to prove,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Newcastle secured their quarter-final berth in December under Kevin Keegan, who has since been replaced by Kenny Dalglish.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if Dalglish's tactics are more defensive than Keegan's I think that at this level in the competition the host team is obliged to show the difference at home and attack to force the issue,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
<p>He said Monaco, six points clear at the top of the French first division, have forgotten their recent defeats in the League Cup semifinals and at Metz in the league.</p>
<p>Having been eliminated in the first round of the French Cup they have no commitments this weekend, and have been practising dead ball situations to rectify mistakes that have cost them goals recently.</p>
<p>Anderson is more relaxed now he has extended his Monaco contract to the year 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I know where my future lies... I won't have my mind any longer on what could happen in the next few months.&quot;</p>
