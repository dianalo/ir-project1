<headline>Mass checks Goldman Sachs for small gifts - source.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Massachusetts Ethics Commission is reviewing whether a former Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co employee might have spent a bit too much entertaining a state official, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the investment bank declined to comment.</p>
<p>The source, who requested anonymity, said the state official, whose identity was not immediately available, was entertained in 1991 and 1993 by an employee in the firm's municipal banking area, who since has left the firm. &quot;The dollar amount was small...It was a few hundred dollars,&quot; the source said, explaining the municipal employee had paid for theater tickets and a meal or two.</p>
<p>The matter was disclosed by the firm in a filing with New York City, the source added, reading the statement he attributed to Goldman:</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, we should advise you that the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission is reviewing whether certain gifts and entertainment by Goldman personnel violated the state's conflict of interest law, which generally limits such gifts and entertainment to $50.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Massachusetts Ethics Commission was not immediately available to comment.</p>
