<p>Japan, always wary of Russian intentions, is this time puzzled.</p>
<p>What puzzles Tokyo is why, after holding Japan at arm's length over a perennial island dispute, should Russia suddenly welcome expanded U.S.-Japan military ties.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome? Why does Russia have to 'welcome' closer defence ties between the United States and Japan? Understand, or condone maybe, but why welcome?&quot; said Sophia University professor Masatsugu Naya, a Russian expert.</p>
<p>The statement that perplexed Naya and other Russia watchers, including those at Japan's Foreign Ministry, came over the weekend from Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov, the first Russian defence minister ever to visit Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not hold concerns about a U.S.-Japan military alliance and understand it is not directed against any third country,&quot; Japanese officials quoted Rodionov as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome that Japan and the United States are building even closer security ties,&quot; Rodionov added in reference to an ongoing review of U.S.-Japan military cooperation.</p>
<p>Naya said he is puzzled by the comments because they come on the heels of pledges of closer Russia-China links.</p>
<p>&quot;Only a few weeks ago, Russia proclaimed a 'strategic partnership' with China in an effort to counterbalance the United States' growing global role,&quot; Naya said. &quot;Rodionov's latest statement does not make any sense.&quot;</p>
<p>After a meeting in Moscow between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in late April, the two countries said they will form a partnership so that no one power, meaning the United States, will dominate the world.</p>
<p>Military analyst Haruo Fujii agreed with Naya.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't seem like Rodionov's remarks in Tokyo were based on any long-term strategic policy and this is very un-Russia like,&quot; said Fujii, an expert on Russia's military.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe Russia is saying it can be flexible, and certainly you can see flexibility in Moscow's latest compromise with NATO's expansion plans. But Rodionov's remarks are still confusing,&quot; Fujii said.</p>
<p>Russia signed an agreement last week with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) despite Moscow's opposition to alliance plans to add new member states from former Soviet bloc countries.</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said they were sceptical about Rodionov's remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't take this on face value,&quot; said one senior ministry official, who asked not to be identified. &quot;After all, they haven't warmed up on the Northern Territories, the one thing that really matters.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan and Russia have still not found a way out of a deadlock over a perennial territorial dispute about what Tokyo calls its &quot;Northern Territories&quot;, islands northeast of Japan, which has prevented the two sides from signing a World War Two peace treaty.</p>
<p>Despite a landmark 1993 agreement to resolve the dispute over the Russian-held islands through political dialogue, Russia has still not shown signs of a compromise.</p>
<p>Only last week, in three days of talks in Tokyo ending on Friday, diplomats from the two sides failed to reach agreement on fishery rights around the islands.</p>
<p>Called the Southern Kuriles by Russia, the islands were seized by Soviet troops in the closing days of World War Two.</p>
<p>Japan says it does not accept that Russia should have exclusive fishing rights around the islands as they are disputed. Russian patrol boats have often fired on Japanese fishermen in waters around the islands, saying they are poachers.</p>
<p>As if to keep pace with Rodionov's surprise statement, however, Japan did its own somersault on Russian relations while he was in town.</p>
<p>In a decision that Japanese officials went out of their way to stress was not linked to Rodionov's talks, Tokyo reversed its policy of opposing Russia's full participation in the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations' summit.</p>
<p>The G7 links Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;The G7 membership issue has nothing to do with this,&quot; Fujii said. &quot;Japan just didn't want to be isolated at the Denver (G7) summit by being the last member saying no to Moscow's full membership.&quot;</p>
