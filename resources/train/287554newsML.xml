<title>ISRAEL: Israeli unlinked bonds lead broad rise.</title>
<headline>Israeli unlinked bonds lead broad rise.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-01-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli bonds closed broadly higher on Sunday led by a further rise in unlinked bonds, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.2 to 100.33</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.2 pct to 100.28</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds (Gilon -- issued for four years): +0.24 pct to 100.67</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: +0.12 pct to 100.05</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.17 pct to 100.37.</p>
<p>Volume was moderate at 188 million shekels with trading in unlinked bonds rising to 92 million shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;The positive trend in the unlinked bonds continued from Thursday,&quot; said a trader at Bank Leumi, who said she could find no logical explanation for the strong demand for unlinked bonds and Makams.</p>
<p>&quot;The yields on some of the Makam series fell below 14 percent but investors are still willing to buy. This is real madness,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Big mutual funds, which sold unlinked bonds before the end of the year to gain tax benefits, were buying them back today. The funds were also active buying bonds outside the market,&quot; a trader at the First International Bank of Israel said.</p>
<p>Traders said that by contrast activity in CPI-linked bonds was low, although there was some demand for long bonds.</p>
<p>Dollar-linked bonds rose for the first time in several weeks following the rise of the U.S. currency against most major currecies on Friday, the First International trader added.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
