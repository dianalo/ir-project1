<p>Canada was determined to press ahead with the international rescue mission for Central Africa despite the mass return of refugees to Rwanda, Prime Minister Jean Chretien said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The mandate is still the same. We have to go there and we have to go for humanitarian purposes,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council on Friday authorised an international force to help refugees return and facilitate aid deliveries but some -- including Washington -- have now begun to have misgivings over whether it is necessary.</p>
<p>Even Chretien and Defence Minister Doug Young left open a crack for the first time to the possibility of military force not being needed, though both believed it was still required.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do everything that is necessary to complete the work. We believe troops are needed, but we will be happy if there is no need,&quot; said Chretien, who staked his prestige on personally assembling the international force.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been informed that close to 500,000 people have returned to Rwanda,&quot; he said, but added: &quot;Still a lot of people are in a desperate situation in many parts of eastern Zaire.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain, France, Italy and the United States are among the countries that have agreed at least conditionally to join the force, but strategists everywhere are scrambling to decide exactly how it should be deployed.</p>
<p>Canada has sent about 200 soldiers on reconnaissance but is waiting to send the bulk of its planned 1,500-strong force to the region until it makes a proper assessment of the quickly changing situation.</p>
<p>The head of the overall force, Canada's Lt. Gen Maurice Baril, left Ottawa on Sunday night for Rwanda via Kenya, to make a personal assessment and also to make representations to the Rwanda government, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>He will head to Stuttgart, Germany, for a meeting with representatives of participating countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Gen. Baril will report to us, we'll discuss with the partners and adjust the mission to make sure that the work is concluded as quickly as possible,&quot; Chretien said.</p>
<p>Young told Parliament: &quot;Surely we can all agree that it is too early to say the crisis is over.&quot;</p>
<p>He added half a million refugees remained behind and few understood their plight, but he did not insist that Canadian forces would for sure be required.</p>
<p>&quot;Canadian forces continue to prepare for a possible deployment. Over the coming days, as we assess the situation, we want to make sure that they're capable of acting if that is required,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy told Parliament: &quot;We now have to find an integrated, strategic, comprehensive way of melding political, military and humanitarian efforts so that there is a complete and total response.&quot;</p>
<p>Chretien's nephew Raymond Chretien is the U.N. troubleshooter for the crisis and talked with the prime minister on Sunday night: &quot;In talking with Ambassador Chretien, he told me that U.N. intervention was still needed.&quot;</p>
<p>The prime minister also called some national leaders to shore up support for the international force.</p>
<p>International Cooperation Minister Don Boudria announced he was convening a meeting of major aid donors in Brussels or Geneva next Saturday or Monday to help returning refugees resettle in their home countries. Canada itself is giving $15 million Canadian ($11.3 million U.S.) in refugee aid.</p>
