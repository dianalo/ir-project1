<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended firmer in muted dealings on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said a mix of trade and speculative buying drove prices higher early in the day, but arbitrage sales in favor of London cocoa took the steam out of the rally.</p>
<p>The market drifted in firmer territory for the remainder of the session, but with little fresh news to trade on, turnover was exceedingly light.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a little bit of commission house buying early on, but the market failed to rally,&quot; said one trader. &quot;For the moment it looks like we are stuck in this range.&quot;</p>
<p>July futures rose $9 a tonne, to close at $1,458, after trading from $1,456 to $1,467. Spot May gained $12, to $1,437, while the deferred months climbed between $8 and $10.</p>
<p>Traders said interest in the market would likely remain low unless July could break out of the $1,410-1,480 range it has held for more than two weeks. A key chart gap created earlier this month looms overhead from $1,480 to $1,501, while support is seen at $1,430 and $1,410.</p>
<p>An estimated 4,020 lots were traded on the day.</p>
