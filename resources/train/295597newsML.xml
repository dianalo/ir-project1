<title>CANADA: Amoco Canada mum on approximate Canmar price.</title>
<headline>Amoco Canada mum on approximate Canmar price.</headline>

<p>Amoco Corp unit Amoco Canada Petroleum Co Ltd declined on Thursday to place an approximate value on its Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar) unit.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not in a position to quote any approximate value,&quot; said Amoco Canada vice-president Vince Rodych. &quot;That is actually part of the exercise of providing information for potential buyers.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said earlier it had retained Lazard Freres &amp; Co LLC as financial adviser for a possible sale of Canmar, which it calls the world's leading provider of Arctic offshore drilling and marine services contracting.  </p>
<p>Canmar, which began operations during the heyday of Canadian Arctic oil exploration in the 1970s, operates a fleet of four drilling systems and six support vessels.</p>
<p>The Amoco Canada subsidiary has drilled 75 percent of the offshore wells in the Canadian and U.S. Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea and currently has vessels operating in the North Sea and off southeast Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;The Canmar fleet was designed and built to pursue Beaufort exploration and was active in doing so from 1976 and for the decade beyond that,&quot; Rodych said.</p>
<p>&quot;Subsequent to that, with a different outlook on world oil prices, Beaufort production is still in the distant future.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Canmar, which has about 75 employees, has been successful since the end of Beaufort exploration in taking on contracts in other parts of the world. However, some of the equipment has not been used to the extend it was in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
<p>Amoco Canada said that the time was ripe to review its ownership in the unit because of Canmar's &quot;current marketability.&quot; ((-- Reuters Calgary Bureau (403) 531-1624))</p>
