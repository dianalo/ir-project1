<p>(From the &quot;Inside Canberra&quot; newsletter)</p>
<p>Queensland premier Rob Borbidge's latest insult to Prime Minister John Howard is all about the terror in the Queensland National Party of the Pauline Hanson bandwagon.</p>
<p>Stating Howard's 10-point Wik plan would &quot;stuff the bush&quot;, Borbidge called for explicit extinguishment of native title.</p>
<p>He knows full well Howard cannot go down this track as it would be more certain than ever that such legislation would be rejected by the High Court.</p>
<p>Borbidge is getting in early with a &quot;don't blame me&quot; approach should the fallout in the bush be damaging when the full Howard plan is revealed.</p>
<p>The latest Newspoll, taken after the launch of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, showed in Queensland the party was polling the same as the Democrats -- four percent.</p>
<p>But it will not be the Australian Democrats who suffer should One Nation gain a Senate seat, but rather the National Party which could see Senator Bill O'Chee lose his seat.</p>
<p>Hanson has been easily pulling far larger crowds than O'Chee in appearances throughout Queensland.</p>
<p>Hanson's anti-Aboriginal, anti-Asian platform appeals far more to the natural National Party supporter than the supporter of the Democrats.</p>
<p>Four percent is an impressive result for Hanson. But her party is unlikely to win a seat in the Senate unless she stands herself by resigning from her formerly safe Labor seat of Oxley.</p>
<p>The strength of her party is the incredible visibility she has achieved in the comparatively short time she has been in parliament -- just over a year.</p>
<p>But this is also the weakness of her party -- it is a one-woman outfit.</p>
<p>If she stands for the Senate she will almost certainly win in a double dissolution election because of the much lower quota -- 7.7 per cent after distribution of preference votes -- and she will have a good chance in a normal half Senate election even though the quota -- 14.3 per cent -- is much higher.</p>
