<headline>LIFFE sugar resumes downwards trend but trade thin.</headline>

<p>White sugar futures again drifted lower on Wednesday morning but turnover stayed on the thin side with spreads holding broadly in line.</p>
<p>Traders said the gentle downward trend was likely to be maintained for the time being after light selling from funds eroded some October stops. Initial targets would be $321 and $320, they said.</p>
<p>At 1210 GMT October was down $1.30 at $323.90 and December down $1.20 at $320.90. Volume was just 340 lots.</p>
<p>On the fundamental side, Syria has tendered to buy 13,000 tonnes of white sugar for shipment between September 20 and October 20.</p>
<p>September 3 is set as the final date for receiving price offers with results to be made known a day later.</p>
<p>The Paris market was quiet ahead of the European Union's first sugar export licence tender of the new 1997/98 series.</p>
<p>A total of 84 lots of spot October were posted on the board. The contract was down 40 cents at $324.00. Nothing was traded on the lesser-quality 100 ICUMSA market.</p>
