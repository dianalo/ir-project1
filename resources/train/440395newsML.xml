<p>The Federal Reserve needs to be particularly alert now to economic imbalances that could lead to higher inflation, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Michael Moskow said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're entering the seventh year of our expansion,&quot; Moskow said. &quot;It's a time when we have to be especially alert to imbalances in the economy that might be leading to inflationary pressure and an acceleration of inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Interviewed by public television's Nightly Business Report program, Moskow made clear that the central bank was not opposed to higher wages for workers.  </p>
<p>Moskow said that wage increases to date have been offset by improved productivity and thus have not led to higher inflation. &quot;We would like to see wages continue to increase as long as they're offset by productivity increases,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the Fed expects the economy to grow by two to 2.5 percent this year, with inflation in the three percent range and unemployment at about the level it is now. The jobless rate in February was 5.3 percent.</p>
<p>In response to a question, Moskow said the central bank looks at &quot;dozens and dozens&quot; of measures in setting monetary policy, including the stock and bond markets.</p>
