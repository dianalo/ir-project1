<p>Vietnamese rubber prices were seen steady on Wednesday on the back of good demand from China, but some traders said risks of trading with the country's northern neighbour were making other markets look attractive.</p>
<p>High grade SVR L rubber was quoted at around $1,320 a tonne, unchanged over the past week.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been holding at these levels because Chinese demand is good. I think China will still buy several hundred tonnes this month,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers in Singapore said one reason behind the demand was a discount of around 17 Malaysian cents on the rubber from Vietnam compared with the same kind of rubber from Malaysia which was being quoted at 343 cents per kilo.</p>
<p>A similar picture was confirmed by officials at state-owned Vietnam General Rubber Company (Geruco), but for the semi-official trade which accounts for around 50 percent of known exports, the situation was less clear.</p>
<p>Local dealers said exporting to China entailed risks of defaults and other problems making buyers in Europe or Taiwan Chinese rubber prices were similarly seen steady, but traders said they could rise in the short term despite relatively large stocks in the main producing province of Hainan.</p>
<p>Prices of physical rubber were quoted at around 13,300 yuan a tonne, including value-added tax, in southern Hainan as offered by the Hainan Nongken Group, a company official said.</p>
<p>The group is the biggest rubber producer and supplier in Hainan and effectively controls the market.</p>
<p>One factor affecting prices was that output was expected to drop by 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes compared with 1995 following damage by a typhoon this month, another company official said.</p>
<p>Last year, output was 200,000 tonnes, accounting for 65 percent of total domestic production, he said.</p>
<p>The price on the Hainan physical rubber exchange centre was quoted at 12,950 yuan, excluding value-added tax.</p>
<p>A local futures trader estimated physical rubber stock in Hainan at about 60,000 tonnes, and said this could put heavy pressure on both physical and futures markets.</p>
