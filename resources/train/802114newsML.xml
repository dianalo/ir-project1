<title>RUSSIA: Supporters of rebel Tajik colonel remain defiant.</title>
<headline>Supporters of rebel Tajik colonel remain defiant.</headline>

<p>Armed supporters of Tajikistan's rebel colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev vowed on Friday not to hand over their weapons until government troops also honoured their part of an agreement hammered out this week.</p>
<p>Russia's Interfax news agency quoted the rebel brigade's chief of staff, Ergash Khasanov, as saying &quot;our corps will not hand over its weapons&quot; because heavy artillery and pro-government forces had not withdrawn from Kurgan-Tyube.</p>
<p>Khudoyberdyev's house in Kurgan Tyube, 110 km (70 miles) south of the Tajik capital Dushanbe, came under attack on Thursday from what the rebel leader said were government troops.</p>
<p>Just before the attack, Khudoyberdyev had told Reuters that the government of President Imomali Rakhmonov was not fulfilling its part of the peace agreement.</p>
<p>He also said he still considered himself to be in charge of the elite brigade he has commanded until now, despite an order by Rakhmonov removing him from the post.</p>
<p>Fighting erupted between rival armed groups last weekend, just weeks after Rakhmonov signed a peace agreement with Islamic opposition guerrillas which ended four years of civil war in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The Tajik government said on Wednesday the rebel colonel had agreed to withdraw his forces to barracks after peace talks following the fighting around Dushanbe.</p>
<p>A government commission was due to fly to Kurgan-Tyube later on Friday to oversee the rebel brigade's surrender of weapons and property.</p>
<p>But Interfax quoted a military source in Dushanbe as saying the trip would only go ahead if it received assurances of safety from the rebels.</p>
