<p>A sharp peso depreciation after Friday's falls is likely to throw the Philippine economy off track, at least in the near term, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term, prices will rise, some jobs will be lost, and the economy will slow down. As things are unfolding, it is doubtful if the domestic economy would be able to grow at five percent in 1997,&quot; said Benjamin Diokno, professor at the University of the Philippines' School of Economics.</p>
<p>Diokno said it will take the economy three to 18 months before it can fully adjust to a weaker peso regime -- higher import and fuel costs, thereby affecting the production costs of most manufacturing firms.</p>
<p>&quot;The long-term prospects look better,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The peso went into a tailspin on Friday morning after the Central Bank gave up its defence of the peso and allowed it to fluctuate in &quot;a new wider range&quot;.</p>
<p>The peso immediately fell to a 45-month low of 29.45 from the previous day's close of 26.401 minutes after the unexpected announcement.</p>
<p>The Bankers Association of the Philippines decided to suspend trading for the day due to the wild volatility.</p>
<p>Traders were expecting the peso to weaken further as speculators continued to pound the peso without much intervention from the Central Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;You've just hurt the three very good years that you had, 1994 to 1996,&quot; Asian Development Bank economist Dilip Das told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The general expectation was that the good years will continue. But all of a sudden, sparked by the baht depreciation, this has damaged the Philippine economy. It's very unfortunate,&quot; Das said, adding that a depreciation could have been done in a more orderly fashion.</p>
<p>The Philippines was expecting gross national product to grow by 7.0 to 8.0 percent this year, with the inflation rate averaging at 5.2 to 5.7 percent.</p>
<p>The Philippines was registering an accelerated growth rate since 1992, coupled with sliding inflation and robust export growth rates. This prompted many Philippine watchers to declare that it was finally out of the boom-bust cycle which characterised its economy since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Das rejected the impression that a weaker peso will bode well for exporters, saying many exporters used imported raw materials for their end-products.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a generalisation must not be made. It's careless. It's not accurate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Philippine exports have been cited as one of the brightest performers in the past years, second only to China, Das added.</p>
<p>Josef Yap, an economist at the state-run think-tank Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), said the inflation rate might increase to 7.0 to 8.0 percent this year, which he believed was still manageable.</p>
<p>&quot;The net result will be favourable as long as people don't abuse the situation by raising their prices,&quot; he said.</p>
