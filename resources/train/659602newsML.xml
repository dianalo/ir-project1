<p>President Clinton finds several aspects of tax cutting legislation now passing through Congress &quot;quite objectionable&quot;, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Friday.</p>
<p>McCurry told reporters Clinton was unhappy about the legislation emerging from the House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ways and Means bill included, despite the protests of the president ... some of those very features he considers quite objectionable. This is not the bill that's going to be signed into law,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>He said Clinton felt the tax breaks in the bill were not sufficiently targeted to middle incomes and disproportionately benefited the rich.</p>
<p>He said the White House would seek to improve the bill as it moved through Congress to try to get it closer to Clinton's key idea of providing tax relief for middle class families.</p>
<p>The Ways and Means Committee, voting strictly along party lines, approved legislation early Friday to cut taxes by a net $85 billion over five years. All the Democrats on the committee opposed the bill.</p>
<p>The bill must now pass the full House of Representatives, and any differences with Senate legislation need to be worked out before it goes to the president.</p>
<p>The single biggest item in the bill was the child tax credit at a cost of $71 billion over five years. It would give families a $400 tax credit in 1998 for each child under age 17, increased to $500 in following years.</p>
<p>The legislation would also allow taxpayers to claim a tax credit for 50 percent of college tuition up to $1,500.</p>
<p>The administration has argued the Republican plan would penalize students going to less-expensive schools like community colleges who would not then get the full tax credit.</p>
<p>The bill would cut the maximum capital gains tax rate to 20 percent from 28 percent for individuals and gradually reduce the rate for corporations to 30 percent from the current 35 percent.</p>
<p>The bill also provided inheritance tax relief by gradually raising the threshold at which the estate tax is imposed to $1 million in 2007 from $600,000 currently.</p>
<p>The administration feels confident of its ability to impose its will on Congress, especially after Clinton successfully faced down Republicans on legislation to provide emergency aid to areas of the country hit by flooding.</p>
<p>Republicans suffered a major public opinion loss after they tried to attach other provisions to the legislation and were eventually forced to strip these from the bill to win Clinton's signature.</p>
