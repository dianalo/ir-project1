<title>INDIA: India I-Sec predicts rally in zero coupon bonds.</title>
<headline>India I-Sec predicts rally in zero coupon bonds.</headline>

<p>India's ICICI Securities &amp; Finance Company (I-Sec) said it expected prices of zero percent 1999 and zero percent 2000 (III) securities to climb in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The zero percent 1999 trading at an yield of 12.52 percent gives a 257 basis point differential over the 16 January treasury bill,&quot; I-Sec said in a debt market commentary.</p>
<p>I-Sec is the Indian affiliate of investment bank J.P.Morgan.</p>
<p>&quot;This differential is even more glaring at 371 basis points when yield on zero percent 1999 is computed on a money market basis (13.66 percent) to make it comparable with treasury bill yields,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said such a large maturity spread was not warranted by the one-year difference between the two securities.</p>
<p>&quot;We should see the price of the zero percent 1999 move up by a rupee or more over the next fortnight. Hence switching from the 16 January treasury bill to zero percent 1999 is likely to offer excellent holding period returns,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Another buy opportunity at current price levels, but not as good as zero percent 1999, was zero percent 2000, I-Sec said.</p>
<p>This security traded at an yield of 13.35 percent, was marginally higher than the yield on 13.55 percent 2001 despite having a lower residual maturity as well as lower duration.</p>
<p>&quot;Additionally, the duration on the zero percent 2000 (III) will decrease at a faster pace than duration on the 13.55 percent 2001. This is a good opportunity for investors to switch from 13.55 percent 2001 to zero percent 2000 (III), thus improving the yield and reducing the risk (duration),&quot; it said.</p>
