<p>British retail sales dipped in September, official figures showed on Wednesday, providing evidence that while high street shops are busy there is little danger of a runaway consumer boom.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics said retail sales fell 0.3 percent in September compared with a 0.9 percent rise in August.</p>
<p>But longer-term measures showed consumer spending is still growing fast. The ONS said sales were 3.5 percent higher than in September a year ago.</p>
<p>This was a welcome boost to the ruling Conservatives who are eager to restore a strong sense of economic wellbeing before the general election, which must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>Government officials pounced on the figures as evidence the consumer-led recovery is still on track.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall in September sales followed a rise in August, and the two months together suggest conditions in the high street are bustling,&quot; said Treasury minister Angela Knight.</p>
<p>A sharp fall in sales of clothing and footwear was the main culprit in dragging down overall retail activity in September.</p>
<p>Prices in this sector rose sharply in September and City economists said retailers appeared to be finding it difficult to coax thrifty consumers into paying higher prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers are not yet willing to abandon the bargain- hunting mentality and still balk at paying higher non-sale prices,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy.</p>
<p>Sales of textiles, clothing and footwear fell 3.0 percent in September after jumping 2.2 percent in August. Clothing and footwear prices leapt by 5.2 percent in September.</p>
<p>With the election looming, the government will take heart from the recent spate of data which shows the economy growing steadily, consumer spending rising but little sign of inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Coupled with the latest unemployment figures which showed the jobless total at a five-year low in September, retail sales data suggests the &quot;feel-good&quot; factor, or consumer confidence, is gradually making a comeback.</p>
<p>But although high street spending remains solid, a return to the eighties-style consumer boom is still a long way off, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a firm underlying trend there but we're not back to the frothiness we saw in the late '80s,&quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell economist Ciaran Barr.</p>
<p>And the slowdown in sales will give Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke more ammunition to resist calls by Bank of England Governor Eddie George to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>Clarke has cut interest rates four times since last December to their present 5.75 percent level is under considerable political pressure to resist calls for a further increase before the election.</p>
