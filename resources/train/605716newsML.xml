<p>When James Darrow claimed to be a killer, few believed him in this small woodland town near the Quebec border. It turns out he may have been telling the truth.</p>
<p>Darrow, 37, who residents said on Thursday had a reputation as a braggart and teller of tall tales, was charged this week with beating to death John Avery, his sister's boyfriend, in Connecticut in May 1985.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't call (him) 'Big Jim the Liar' for nothing. You name it, he lied about it,&quot; Michael Forgue, a restaurant owner in the town where Darrow has lived for several years and worked as a cook.</p>
<p>Forgue said that among Darrow's stories was one in which he claimed to have killed a man in Connecticut.</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows? Who could believe him? No one,&quot; said Forgue, adding that Darrow's story about how the man died varied from telling to telling.</p>
<p>Connectictut police said they began probing the Avery case recently after receiving new information, but declined to specify what the information was.</p>
<p>Authorities said Darrow confessed to killing Avery in Franklin, Connecticut, and dumping his body in a swamp. Darrow helped searchers on Tuesday find remains believed to be Avery's, according to Connecticut State Police.</p>
