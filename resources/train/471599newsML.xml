<headline>Agencies say roads open from Uganda to south Sudan.</headline>

<p>U.N. agencies said on Thursday roads were open for the first time in many years from northern Uganda to the southern Sudanese town of Yei following a rebel offensive.</p>
<p>Operation Lifeline Sudan, which groups U.N. agencies in southern Sudan, said up to 20,000 people in Yei urgently needed food and medicine because of fighting when rebels seized it on March 12.</p>
<p>It said up to 1,200 prisoners of war as well as wounded soldiers also urgently needed food and medicine.</p>
<p>It said while the logistics of moving aid by road into the south from Uganda were finalised the U.N. Children's Fund sent a planeload of aid to Yambio in the south on Wednesday for Yei.</p>
<p>It said two U.N. World Food Programme trucks with 40 tonnes of food were expected to arrive on Thursday in Yei and a team would visit the town to assess needs of refugees who trekked back to their home areas from northern Uganda in recent weeks.</p>
<p>WFP staff say two of the largest Sudanese refugee camps with a population of 81,000 in northern Uganda had virtually emptied over the last week and as many as 60,000 refugees had arrived in south Sudan.</p>
<p>The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) said on Tuesday it had seized the southern army garrison town of Kajo-Keji and controlled Sudan's borders with Zaire and Uganda.</p>
<p>Aid workers, who declined to be identified, confirmed the seizure of Kajo-Keji, 15 km (10 miles) north of the Ugandan border. The town was captured by government forces in June 1994.</p>
<p>Sudan has accused Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea of sending troops to fight alongside the SPLA in its offensives in the south this month and in the east since January. All three deny the charges.</p>
<p>In one of its most successful offensives since 1983, the SPLA has vowed to seize the southern capital city of Juba.</p>
<p>The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence for the Christian and animist south from the Moslem and Arabised north. It and its allies say they want a popular uprising in Khartoum against the Islamist government.</p>
