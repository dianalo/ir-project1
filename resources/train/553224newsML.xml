<p>Iran is emerging as the world's biggest wheat importer in a development that puzzles trade analysts.</p>
<p>A report on Thursday by the London-based International Grains Council, which put a spotlight on Iran's surging imports, also forecast a record global harvest this year of coarse grains -- mainly maize.</p>
<p>The IGC, an authoritative monitor of cereals markets, predicts that Iran will import 6.6 million tonnes of wheat in the 12 months to June 30, 1997. The huge volume puts it ahead of Egypt and Japan.</p>
<p>But the IGC does not venture an opinion on why Iran's imports should be running at more than double the previous year's estimate.</p>
<p>Trade analysts suspect that some of the wheat may be re-exported elsewhere in central Asia, possibly to war-racked Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan closed its borders with Afghanistan on March 29 in an attempt to check smuggling of wheat to that country which had led to flour shortages.</p>
<p>Iran subsidises bread to its population of 60 million, which may also push up consumption, and it suffered some earthquake damage to crops in March.</p>
<p>Australia, Canada and even the European Union have made sales of wheat to Iran.</p>
<p>Its emergence as such a big player in the grains trade raised fears of disruption to the international market during the political row with Western powers which followed a recent German court finding that Iran ordered the 1992 murder of four Kurdish activists in Berlin.</p>
<p>The IGC prediction of 6.6 million tonnes of wheat and flour imports by Iran puts it ahead of Egypt on 6.2 and Japan at 6.0 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The forecast was sharply up from an estimate of 5.0 million tonnes a month ago and from the estimated total for 1995-96 of 3.0 million.</p>
<p>On a wider horizon, the IGC has forecast a record crop of coarse grains. Total production of maize, barley, sorghum rye and oats is set to leap to 895 million tonnes, from 889 million in 1996, on higher production in China and central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>A change in eating habits in the Asia means that the extra grain is needed. As consumption of meat, especially pork and chicken, rises, demand for maize, used to make animal feed, has risen.</p>
<p>Production of wheat is set to fall to 578 million tonnes compared with a bumper 580 million in 1996, because of falls in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>But weather remains the big unknown, grain traders said. The United States has been hit by freeze and flood, while the EU has suffered prolonged dry weather, which has damaged crops in Britain and France.</p>
<p>Its report was issued against a backdrop of renewed concern about high grain prices, at a time when world stocks are around the lowest in 20 years.</p>
<p>Wheat prices &quot;spiked&quot; to historic highs in Chicago grain pits at $7.50 per bushel early in 1996. After flood and freeze in North America and a prolonged dry spell in Europe, some analysts see a risk that importers will again be paying inflated food bills.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat traded at $4.50 in April, up from $3.80 at the end of 1996, and the European Union has reimposed a tax on exports to keep a lid on its internal prices.</p>
