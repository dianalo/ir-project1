<p>The following is a chronology of main events in Iraq's confrontation with the United States since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>February 1991 - U.S. and allied forces cease fire after driving Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Iraq tells army to stop fighting. Later in the year U.S., British and French planes start patrolling Iraq's northern skies to shield Iraq's Kurds from attack by Baghdad.</p>
<p>Dec 27, 1992 - U.S. F-16 fighter shoots down an Iraqi MiG in the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>January 1993 - In major confrontation, U.S. and allied planes blast Iraqi military targets over several days in retaliation for alleged violations of ceasefire terms.</p>
<p>June 1993 - U.S. warships fire 23 cruise missiles at Baghdad, destroying Iraqi intelligence service headquarters wing. Missiles kill six people. Attack ordered to avenge alleged Iraqi plot to kill former U.S. president George Bush.</p>
<p>July and August 1993 - U.S. planes strike anti-aircraft missile sites in series of missile attacks in &quot;no-fly&quot; zones over southern and northern Iraq.</p>
<p>October 1994 - Iraqi Republican Guards move into southern Iraq near border with Kuwait. United States and Britain send forces towards Kuwait to counter buildup.</p>
<p>Aug 31, 1996 - President Bill Clinton places U.S. forces in the Gulf on alert after Iraqi troops supporting Kurdistan Democratic Party attack and capture northern Iraqi city of Arbil from rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.</p>
<p>Sept 3, 1996 - U.S. forces fire 27 sea- and air-launched missiles at targets in southern Iraq. U.S. says strikes are warning to Iraq to comply with Gulf War ceasefire resolutions. Iraq says strikes killed five and wounded 19; U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry says that is &quot;exceedingly unlikely.&quot; In defiant speech, Saddam orders his forces to ignore the &quot;no fly&quot; zones and shoot down intruders. World reaction to U.S. strikes is mixed.</p>
<p>Sept 4, 1996 - United States launches second wave of cruise missiles at Iraqi military targets in what America says is effort to destroy Iraq's ability to attack aircraft enforcing an expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq. Pentagon and White House say 17 missiles were fired from four U.S. ships in a &quot;mop-up&quot; operation. The second wave is aimed at a number of targets not destroyed in an attack by 27 missiles on September 3.</p>
