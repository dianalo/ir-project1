<p>French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis began talks on Saturday with angry employees who have been holding the governor and top managers of Credit Foncier inside the troubled French bank's headquarters for two days in protest at government plans to dismantle it.</p>
<p>The minister abandoned plans to travel to western France to meet the protestors. He had initially insisted talks could be held only if they brought the captive governor along with them.</p>
<p>But he backed down after bank staff squatting in the ornate building refused to let Jerome Meysonnier go unless the government first axed plans to break up the firm, which it rescued from collapse last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk is that we won't see him again,&quot; union official Michel Deswert told Reuters. &quot;If we don't get what we want, we are ready to sit here for as long as it takes.&quot;</p>
<p>The workers are fighting a government plan to wind down the near-bankrupt company and spin its housing loans business off to property credit group Credit Immobilier, a rescue package the state deems unavoidable unless another buyer turns up.</p>
<p>The workers fear up to 900 job losses at the 145-year-old property lender, which currently has 3,300 employees.</p>
<p>Arthuis, in a radio interview, had criticised the worker protest as counterproductive but Meysonnier seemed unperturbed by the occupation of his headquarters by about 100 employees.</p>
<p>&quot;I find this to be a form of brutality which prevents us from going forward, which prevents us from building,&quot; Arthuis told France Inter radio.</p>
<p>Meysonnier, walking freely about the building and looking relaxed and in fresh clothes despite his night in the bank, reassured reporters that the protest was peaceful.</p>
<p>&quot;The night went well. Everyone was on their best behaviour,&quot; Meysonnier said. Police were not called.</p>
<p>Employees said Arthuis' remarks had only aggravated the situation and accused state-appointed Meysonnier and the government of trying to fix the bank's future without them.</p>
<p>&quot;The bosses want to do the negotiating while treating us like less than nothing,&quot; complained a man who said he had done 35 years at the venerable bank and could not afford to be named.</p>
<p>The government, which has always appointed the private bank's management because of its role in issuing subsidised loans, intervened directly last year to bail out Credit Foncier following a 1995 loss of 10.8 billion francs ($2.0 billion).</p>
<p>Arthuis launched a preliminary takeover by a state bank and now wants to carry out the second stage of his plan -- spinning off the core business to Credit Immobilier and passing the rest to a state shell company set up to manage its bond loans.</p>
<p>A collapse could have been disastrous for French financial markets, where Credit Foncier was once the second largest issuer of bonds after the state.</p>
<p>But the plan, attacked by minority shareholders and cross-party politicians, stirred up more controversy in the autumn when Credit Foncier said it was now making money and might be a billion francs in the black in 1996.</p>
<p>That led to speculation Meyssonier was at odds with the government over Credit Foncier's future and supported unions who said the bank could survive as a going concern.</p>
<p>Arthuis has said it would cost taxpayers up to five billion francs ($1 billion) to put Credit Foncier on its feet.</p>
<p>But unions accuse management of overloading the 1995 results with 13.6 billion francs of provisions for bad property loans to make a wind-down of Credit Foncier appear inevitable.</p>
