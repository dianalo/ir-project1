<title>ISRAEL: Israel to privatise banks via share offerings.</title>
<headline>Israel to privatise banks via share offerings.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-10-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>M.I. Holdings, the state company in charge of privatising Israel's banks, has decided to sell bank shares through public offerings while pursuing the option of selling controlling stakes to strategic investors, a government source said.</p>
<p>The decision was made after attempts to sell controlling stakes in Israel's biggest banks, Hapoalim and Leumi, ran into difficulties when bidders withdrew their offers.</p>
<p>Edmond Safra, who controls Republic New York Corp, was the sole bidder for Leumi until he withdrew his bid. A consortium led by Israeli businessman Eliezer Fishman is the only bidder for Hapoalim after a group led by Claridge Israel -- the Israeli investment vehicle of Charles Bronfman -- dropped out in August.</p>
<p>The government source said public offerings for about 10 percent of the banks' shares would be made on stock markets in Tel Aviv, Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>The new programme is comprised of share offerings in three of Israel's five major banks -- Leumi, United Mizrahi Bank and Israel Discount Bank, the source said.</p>
<p>He said it had not yet been decided whether a similar offering would be done for Hapoalim.</p>
<p>The decision on where to hold the offerings and in what order would be made according to circumstances at the time of the offerings, the source said.</p>
<p>Hapoalim, Discount and Leumi already trade in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>A controlling 26 percent stake in Mizrahi was sold last year to the Ofer Wertheim groups but a public offering was scrapped at the last minute due to a prolonged labour dispute.</p>
<p>Last March the government sold a 14.5 percent stake in Discount in shares and options on the Tel Aviv market.</p>
<p>The government source as well as a Treasury spokesman refused to confirm a report in the Maariv daily that the first share offering would be for Discount.</p>
