<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin had &quot;substantive and intense&quot; discussions on NATO and arms control on Friday but have not yet reached agreement, Clinton's spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot report to you at this point that they have reached any agreements,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters after the leaders met for two hours at the Finnish president's official residence overlooking the Baltic Sea.  </p>
<p>McCurry said work would continue on NATO and other issues and that the two presidents would discuss economic affairs over lunch, after a morning session lasting two hours.</p>
<p>Faced with bitter opposition from Moscow, Clinton had laid out his argument that NATO enlargement did not represent a threat to Russia &quot;with a great deal of passion and commitment&quot;, McCurry said.</p>
<p>He refused to give concrete details of the talks, which were also attended by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. But McCurry said they were &quot;very lively, very intense&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Several (people) familiar with the meetings the two presidents have had described it as by far the most substantive and intense discussion they have ever had,&quot; he added.</p>
