<p>Changes in global financial circles have made it vital that South Africa achieve the objective of price stability, Reserve Bank economic adviser Ernie van der Merwe said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a speech prepared for delivery at a conference in Pretoria, van der Merwe said that volatile cross-border capital movements, inflation expectations and consequent hedging were best managed by a consistent counter-inflation monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The pursuit of price stability in the rest of the world and the success achieved by many countries in bringing their inflation rates down to low levels, has left South Africa with no alternative than to bring its inflation in step with that of the rest of the world and to keep it there,&quot; van der Merwe said.</p>
<p>If this was not achieved in the coming years, market adjustments -- such as large disruptive capital outflows, a depreciation of the rand and high interest rates -- to compensate for inflation differentials were inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;In future, with globalised financial markets it will be even more important that a consistent counter-inflation policy be pursued, despite pressures which may be placed on the central bank,&quot; van der Merwe said.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals has repeatedly cited lower inflation, money supply and credit growth as key objectives that need to be achieved before cutting interest rates.</p>
<p>His reluctance to move on interest rates has drawn criticism from an array of commentators, who have accused him of foregoing economic growth in favour of achieving targets which economists say are already firmly on a downward trend.</p>
<p>Van der Merwe noted that as a result of international capital flows, the effects of changing interest rates were being transmitted to a greater extent through exchange rates and participants' expectations of possible economic developments.</p>
<p>This sometimes led to longer time lags between policy changes and their desired impact on the real economy, which had made money supply a less reliable indicator of underlying inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The South African Reserve Bank has accordingly started to use a broader range of economic indicators for the determination of policy actions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He noted that other central banks had shifted to direct inflation targetting in their monetary policy strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;In the years beyond 2000 South Africa may also have to adopt such a strategy, provided that the markets for other production factors are restructured to reflect underlying demand and supply conditions,&quot; van der Merwe said. -- Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482-1003</p>
