<p>Jujamcyn Theaters and Pace Theatrical Group said Monday that the two companies are forming a theatrical production company, modeled on the old Hollywood studio system.</p>
<p>The two companies said in a joint statement that they plan to have an established investment pool of $20 million to $25 million to foster new shows, shifting financing away from networks of individual investors toward a &quot;more corporate-dominated business.&quot;</p>
<p>The agreement is intended to nurture shows from development and pre-Broadway tours to a New York run and subsequent international tours in a combined network of more than three dozen theaters, the companies said.</p>
<p>Jujamcyn owns and operates five theaters on Broadway and presents shows in five other U.S. cities.</p>
<p>Pace, the dominant presenter of national tours, is a leading presenter and producer of music, theater and entertainment and owns theaters across the United States.</p>
<p>Under this arrangement, independent producers will have informal agreements with the new partnership and would receive the chance to present the finished work, as well as money and additional support, the companies said.</p>
<p>Pace would receive a steady supply of shows for the road under this arrangement, the companies said.</p>
<p>Jujamcyn, founded in 1956 and named after owners James H. and Virginia Binger's three children, Judith, James and Cynthia, is Broadway's third largest landlord. The Shubert Organization and Nederlander Organization are No. number one and 2.</p>
<p>Pace is part of the Pace Entertainment Corp., based in Houston and founded in 1966.</p>
