<p>Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said on Tuesday it would be in Europe's interests to postpone the start of economic and monetary union, but added that he saw no chance of EU partners negotiating a delay.</p>
<p>Dini told Reuters that everyone was struggling to meet tough criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty for countries wishing to join the launch of the single European currency, scheduled for January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all in a straightjacket,&quot; he said. &quot;If the treaty had provided for an extra year that would have been helpful.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said he thought it would be impossible to re-write Maastricht at this late stage and stressed that Italy was not looking to rock the boat.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not asking (for a delay) at this point in time. We must do our utmost to meet the criteria.&quot; he said, adding that there was &quot;a better than even chance&quot; that the single European currency would begin on time.</p>
<p>Italy has made mammoth efforts in recent years to tame tearaway government spending and halt the surge in state debt in an effort to bring its economy in line with Maastricht demands.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi is due to unveil a further round of belt tightening this week with a package of measures aimed to cut up to 16 trillion lire ($9.5 billion) off the deficit.</p>
<p>The centre-left government says this latest dose of budgetary medicine will ensure that Italy's deficit will fall to the required three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) against 6.7 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>In a separate interview published in financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore on Tuesday, Dini said Italy was doing everything possible to join EMU. &quot;Italy is very close to reaching the EMU criteria. I don't believe there will be any delays on our part.&quot;</p>
<p>And he issued a veiled warning to northern EU countries not to shut the door on the aspirations of Mediterranean allies.</p>
<p>&quot;We shouldn't forget that the euro can't go ahead without the necessary votes. Therefore the exclusion of Mediterranean countries together with, for example, Great Britain, could prevent the launch of EMU thanks to their negative votes.&quot;</p>
<p>The first wave of countries to sign up to EMU are due to be selected in early 1998 by EU heads of state.</p>
<p>Rome believes German public opinion is against Italy joining EMU from day one and with key German elections due in October 1998, this might weigh unfavourably on Italy's chances of joining the single currency elite.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know there is a big debate in Germany between politicians and analysts on what the situation will be,&quot; Dini told Il Sole. &quot;For all this...I believe that a delay of one year will be good for everyone,&quot; he added.</p>
