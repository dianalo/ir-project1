<headline>Three Kurds accused of PKK crimes in German trial.</headline>

<p>Three Kurdish men went on trial in Germany on Tuesday accused of being ringleaders of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and masterminding a 1993 campaign of arson attacks by the banned group.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Thomas Beck said Haydar Ergul, Nihat Asut and Ahmet Yavus had ordered the attacks which targeted Turkish businesses and banks in Germany and resulted in one death.</p>
<p>&quot;The accused are ringleaders of a terrorist organisation which aims to commit murder,&quot; Beck said.</p>
<p>The three men, aged between 34 and 40, praised the PKK's fight for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey in their opening statement to the court.</p>
<p>But they denied the charges against them and said they were not even members of the PKK. Ergul vowed to go on hunger strike for a week in support of fellow Kurds imprisoned in Turkey.</p>
<p>More than two million Turkish citizens live in Germany and about one fifth of them are Kurds.</p>
<p>Police say Kurdish extremists wanting to vent their anger at the Turkish government often target the property of mainstrean Turks whom they view as being loyal to Ankara.</p>
