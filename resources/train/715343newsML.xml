<p>COMEX copper slumped further by noon, the most-active September contract falling to its lowest level since mid-April as a further wave of speculative selling hit the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>A COMEX floor source said early fund selling triggered a further round of speculative selling with people getting out of their positions.</p>
<p>At September's intraday low of 101.50 cents a lb, there was not much left to sell, with support now seen at 100.80 cents, the source added.</p>
<p>At 1237 EDT September was off 3.25 cents at 101.80 cents a lb, traded 104.70 to 101.50 cents. Spot July was down 3.10 cents at 104.30 cents.</p>
<p>The LME cash to three months backwardation eased further to $100/$110 a tonne, down from $120/$130 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Dealers said the copper market was in the midst of a seasonal slowdown, but some expected prices to revisit recent highs later in the summer when plants reopen after maintenance and vacation shutdowns.</p>
