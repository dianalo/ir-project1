<p>THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW</p>
<p>In passing its State Budget last night, the New South Wales Government became the first State to make a move towards taxing Australia's services sector, with the introduction of a 10 per cent bed tax on central and north Sydney hotels. The move was one of nine tax changes, part of a A$400 million package of measures that saw the delivery of a A$27 million surplus. Page 1.</p>

<p>According to Access Economics' latest detailed analysis of the Federal Government's accounts, the Coalition could receive a A$6.8 billion boost to its Budget repair plan by 1998-99 as conditions in the economy improve. The report says the starting point for the 1997-98 Budget, before any policy changes, will be an underlying deficit of A$2.6 billion. Page 3.</p>

<p>The resignation of Independent Senator Mal Colston from his position as Senate Deputy President, and his threat to vote against the Federal Government, has thrown the Coalition's legislative plans into doubt. Colston's vow to thwart the Government may affect key pieces of Budget legislation, and may affect the Government's response to the High Court's controversial Wik decision. Page 4.</p>

<p>Following the Democrats announcement yesterday that they would support the Federal Government's $500 million-a-year superannuation surcharge with only a few changes, the Bill may become law as early as next week. The Opposition has proposed 40 amendments to the Bill, but the Democrats move means only those amendments they support will succeed. Page 4.</p>

<p>THE AUSTRALIAN</p>
<p>As a special meeting of the National Party's Federal Management Committee, which included party Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, agreed yesterday to push for certainty for pastoralists through extinguishment on native title, Prime Minister John Howard indicated he was willing to negotiate changes to his 10-point Wik response.

<p>The New South Wales Budget was brought down last night, forecasting an underlying surplus of A$27 million, and including a A$400 million tax grab and A$50 &quot;cash for kids&quot; school rebate which should entice voters. While the tax slug breaches the Carr Government's 1995 election promises, the Budget has delivered only the third surplus result in State history. Page 1.</p>

<p>Australia's best known private pilot, millionaire Dick Smith, won the newly-created post of deputy chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority last night, and will be joined on the board by another new appointee, Laurence Foley. Smith has been publicly critcal of CASA since he resigned as chairman of the body's predecessor, the Civil Aviation Authority. Page 1.</p>

<p>Figures from Access Economics indicate increasing Aboriginal native title claims have hindered 17 future mineral projects worth A$11.5 billion. The figures come as the Queensland Government considers compensation payments to native title claimants of the Century Zinc project, which has been delayed for five years. Page 1.</p>

<p>THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD</p>
<p>In an attempt to reclaim its traditional voters, the New South Wales Labor Government has passed a Budget which hits the wealthy with A$400 million worth of new measures to be used for increased funding for schools, hospitals, public transport, law and order, and welfare. Page 1.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Embattled Independent Senator Mal Colston has hit out at the Federal Government, claiming he will seek retribution for his forced resignation from the position of Senate Deputy President by blocking crucial Government Bills, including the proposed media ownership changes and measures related to next Tuesday's Budget. Page 1.</p>

<p>Under new laws that last night received unexpected New South Wales Government support, hotels, clubs and restaurants in the State will be forced to ban smoking unless they are able to meet rigorous clean air standards. The laws reflect increasing concern about the effects of passive smoking on workers and patrons. Page 1.</p>

<p>In a discussion paper released yesterday, senior academics at the University of New South Wales have warned of further cuts in staff and the cancellation of several courses if fees of up to A$100,000 for some students are not introduced next year. Page 3.</p>

<p>THE AGE</p>
<p>Tensions within the Coalition heightened yesterday, when National Party Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer endorsed a National Party proposal calling for extinguishment on native title on pastoral leases, which goes against Prime Minister John Howard's 10-point plan. Page 1.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Independent Senator Mal Colston yesterday resigned from his position as Senate Deputy President just minutes before the Senate sat. Colston has vowed to stay in office as an Independent, and said he will oppose any inquiries into claims he misled the Senate, and will vote against the Howard Government on key legislation.

<p>The parents of 15-year-old Kylie Pierce, who died on Monday night in her Bulleen home after inhaling a lethal dose of butane gas, which is normally used to fill cigarette lighters, yesterday warned other parents against ignoring danger signs in their teengers. Page 1.</p>
