<p>Israeli plastics products maker ZAG Industries Inc expects U.S. sales to rise sharply to half its total in the next two years, the company's chief executive and president said.</p>
<p>The executive, Zvi Yemini, told Reuters that ZAG was starting production in Mexicali, Mexico, in the next few weeks to supply the U.S. market. It also plans to begin production in Canada and possibly New Jersey in the next two years.  </p>
<p>The United States makes up about 35 percent of ZAG's sales. The producer of such goods as plastic storage containers, tool boxes and garden tools had sales of $50.5 million last year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that when we ... bring production overseas to North America it is going to grow up to 50 percent in the coming two years,&quot; Yemini said.  </p>
<p>The opening of the Mexicali plant will help bring world production to 13 million to 14 million items this year, up from 10 million in 1996, he said. The company has eight plants, most of them sub-contracted, and about 140 employees worldwide.</p>
<p>ZAG is opening the plants to satisfy U.S. customers with quicker deliveries, lower transport costs and speed design changes.</p>
<p>&quot;Some American buyers, they don't want to think about three-month projections. They want it -- boom,&quot; said Yemini. &quot;We're going to do what the buyers want.&quot;  </p>
<p>About 30 percent of its total sales are done through Home Depot Inc, the home-improvement chain. In a joint venture, ZAG will start supplying Black &amp; Decker Corp with cases for electric tools at the start of July.</p>
<p>ZAG also plans to begin production in East Asia in mid-1998. Taiwan is a possible location for the production site, Yemini said.</p>
<p>He added that he wanted to see ZAG's sales reach &quot;a few hundred million a year&quot; in coming years.</p>
<p>The expansion plans were a major reason for the appointment of Amiel Sadeh to the newly created post of president and chief operating officer. He had been a co-managing director of Israel's Delta Galil Industries Ltd.</p>
<p>Sadeh was an appropriate choice since Delta Galil &quot;are in the textile business -- underwear,&quot; Yemini joked. &quot;So the company knows storage.&quot;</p>
