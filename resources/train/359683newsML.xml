<title>UK: Oil prices hit four-month low as OPEC output rises.</title>
<headline>Oil prices hit four-month low as OPEC output rises.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Oil prices tumbled to their lowest level in more than four months as speculators gambled that the worst of this winter's cold weather was nearly over and supplies were more than adequate.</p>
<p>Production from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries hit a 16-year high in January, according to a Reuter survey, and supplies of heating oil have been replenished on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Futures contracts on gas oil, or home heating oil, lost five percent in value and helped drag crude oil prices through critical technical support levels, which in turn attracted more sellers, traders said.</p>
<p>World benchmark Brent Blend crude futures on London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) ended trade 78 cents lower at $21.68 a barrel, after bottoming out at $21.57, the lowest level for front-month crude since September 17.</p>
<p>Jeff Potter, managing director of Dublin-based Univest Ireland Ltd, said oil prices normally drop this time of year as demand for gas oil starts to taper off, and the building up of gasoline inventories before spring has yet to occur.</p>
<p>&quot;We always get this drop in February,&quot; he said. &quot;We get the hardest month of the year weather-wise and the lowest prices...It's a seasonal drop.&quot;</p>
<p>Much of the fall came during the afternoon session after the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) opened and heating oil futures there broke through several layers of support.</p>
<p>&quot;The heating oil season is over,&quot; a New York dealer said.</p>
<p>March heating oil on NYMEX had its lowest settlement in five months on Wednesday. The London market usually takes its lead from New York.</p>
<p>Brent crude oil futures had resiliently held support at the psychological $22 a barrel floor in recent days and failed to break through on Tuesday, despite evidence that gas oil futures were no longer providing a winter prop to the rest of the barrel.</p>
<p>Weekly U.S. oil stocks data issued on Tuesday and Wednesday showed that industry inventories were in surplus compared with year-ago levels for the first time since June 1995.</p>
<p>February gas oil ended trade $9.25 a tonne lower at $191.75 a tonne.</p>
<p>Signs that the market was well-supplied gave the bears the upper hand.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey showed January production by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), swollen by Iraq's first full month of exports under the United Nations oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>Wellhead crude oil production from OPEC countries rose to 26.64 million bpd from a revised 26.34 million in December, a Reuter survey of oil analysts, OPEC delegates and company officials found.</p>
<p>And OPEC, pumping an extra 600,000 bpd in the past two months, looks set to add more barrels as foreign companies, bringing new fields onstream, seek to cash in on their investments, OPEC monitors said.</p>
<p>&quot;I see OPEC heading to 27 million bpd by the middle of the year -- easily,&quot; said Mehdi Varzi, director of research for energy at finance house Kleinwort Benson Securities.</p>
<p>OPEC's official output ceiling is a combined 25.033 million bpd for the 11-member cartel.</p>
