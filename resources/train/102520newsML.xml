<title>EGYPT: Egyptian shares at six-week low, turnover weak.</title>
<headline>Egyptian shares at six-week low, turnover weak.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1996-10-08</dateline>

<p>Egyptian share prices fell back to a six-week low on Tuesday in thin trade and the exchange authorities suspended some brokerages for failing to meet a stringent new timetable for settlement, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index lost 0.4 points to close at 233.55 points, the lowest level since August 22. Turnover was 11.70 million pounds ($3.44 million) which is less than the volume of any single day since mid-July.</p>
<p>The supply of privatisation issues has dried up temporarily as the exchange adjusts to a new clearing house system which requires brokers to settle accounts by T+2 or within two days of a transaction taking place.</p>
<p>&quot;Several brokerages got a warning yesterday and some have been banned from dealing temporarily for failing to complete their settlements in time,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>&quot;It started with about 20 but some of them managed to solve their problems,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>CMA officials were not available to comment.</p>
<p>Brokers said recently privatised flour milling firms continued to dominate trade because they remained especially attractive, with average PE ratios of about seven.</p>
<p>Central and West Delta Flour Mills and East Delta Flour Mills both rose, by 0.25 to 53.21 pounds and by 1.75 to 40.00 pounds. It was the second day of trading for East Delta, which was sold to the public at 29.00.</p>
<p>Upper Egypt Flour Mills slipped 0.15 to 47.85.</p>
<p>Ahmed el-Helw of brokers Hermes EFG said interest in cements, once the backbone of the exchange, had waned over the weeks. Turnover has fallen and prices have stabilised, he said.</p>
<p>Helw said the exchange would probably be ready to handle new privatisations by late October and a central depositary system could be in place in late November.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms fell to 357.45 from 359.29 on Monday while the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms slipped to 162.57 from 162.63 points.</p>
<p>Declines outnumbered gains by 23 to 10.</p>
