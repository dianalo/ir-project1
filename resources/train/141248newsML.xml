<p>Alltrista Corp said Thursday it expects earnings for the fourth quarter to be at least equal to the earnings reported a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the 1995 fourth quarter, Alltrista had a loss of $0.03 a share after a $0.26 a share charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Discounting the weather-related impact on our consumer products business, we had generally satisfying quarter,&quot; Thomas Clark, president, said. &quot;We should, at a minimum, equal last year's earnings during the final quarter of the year and with the efficiencies and cost savings we'll get from the Kerr business, we should have a good year in 1997.&quot;  </p>
<p>Alltrista said its food container business performed below year-earlier levels during the third quarter, as expected, while the industrial components segment had both increased sales and operating earnings.</p>
<p>A poor growing season hampered sales in the home canning business, as expected. Total sales for the business unit were above year ago levels, but operating earnings were lower. Both sales and operating earnings improved in the Canadian home canning business, reflecting an increased market share.</p>
<p>Domestic home canning sales of the Ball brand were slightly lower than the same period last year, but earnings were off to a greater extent as a result of higher warehousing costs for inventory carried over from 1995. In addition, higher advertising and sales promotion costs hurt profits.</p>
<p>Alltrista said it has incurred duplicate costs prior to full integration of its Kerr home canning acquisition. The company earlier this month said it would be consolidating the manufacture of home canning closures at a plant in Muncie and that it expects to achieve efficiencies as a result.</p>
<p>Updating a share repurchase program, Alltrista said it bought back 630,000 shares at a cost of $14 million.</p>
<p>Shares of Alltrista were trading off 1/4 to 21.</p>
