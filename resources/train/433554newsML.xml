<p>Conservative House Democrats, whose support is key to passing a budget this year, warned Senate budget leaders Tuesday they will oppose attempts to cut taxes without first eliminating the deficit.</p>
<p>Wrangling over tax cuts is expected to heat up this year as the Republican-controlled Congress and the White House begin more intense negotiations over President Clinton's budget proposal.</p>
<p>Texas Democrat Charles Stenholm, a leader of the conservative House group known popularly as the &quot;Blue Dogs,&quot; told the Senate Budget Committee the 23-member group believed tax cuts should be the reward for getting rid of the deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;The coalition is not opposed to cutting taxes. However, we do not believe under any circumstances that a tax cut paid for with borrowed money makes sense,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Blue Dog plan trims federal agencies, holds down the growth of Medicare and Medicaid health care programmes and reduces annual cost of living increases for retirees.</p>
<p>But it has no tax cut, while Republican lawmakers have called for tax cuts nearly double the $98 billion proposed by Clinton and want a broad capital gains rate cut.</p>
<p>Clinton has suggested his tax cuts be paid for with $76 billion in tax increases, many on businesses that would lose tax breaks. Republicans have not said what they would do to offset their proposed cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;The tax cut is giving (taxpayers) relief but it is like starting with dessert. We feel you ought to start with the spinach,&quot; Blue Dog Representative David Minge, a Minnesota Democrat, said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin defended the president's tax cut plan and warned against each party trying to outdo the other with larger and larger tax cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;We must not engage in a 'bidding war' over tax cuts,&quot; he said in prepared testimony to the House Budget Committee. He said large tax cuts could hurt the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Tax cuts which are higher would ... run a serious risk of requiring us to make (spending) cuts that unduly harm our economy and our society -- or abandon the goal of a balanced budget, which we absolutely must not do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The White House and Blue Dogs have developed proposals aimed at a balanced budget by 2002 and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, told reporters after the hearing he felt no time pressure to come up with a Republican alternative.</p>
<p>House Republicans were clamouring for Clinton to resubmit his proposal, which they charge leaves a $69 billion deficit in 2002, the year he claimed it would balance. The House was to vote later Tuesday on their resolution urging him to do this but it will not carry the force of law.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't look for a wrangle over this; we look for an opportunity for them (White House) to reassess it and give us their best recommendations how to fix it,&quot; House Republican Leader Dick Armey said.</p>
<p>The White House responded that it is confident its budget will produce a $17 billion surplus in 2002, as it forecast. The dispute involved differences in economic forecasts but both sides used estimates of future economic growth called conservative by outside economists.</p>
<p>House Republican leaders still expected the full House to vote on a budget resolution in May. This resolution would be the blueprint for congressional decisions on spending and taxes for the coming 1998 fiscal year.</p>
