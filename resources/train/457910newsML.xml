<p>A top U.S. government human rights official arrived in East Timor on Thursday on what he said was a fact-finding mission to the former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia two decades ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of this visit is to emphasise the importance the United States places on positive discussion under the auspices of the U.N. secretary general on the issue of East Timor,&quot; John Shattuck told reporters on his arrival in the capital, Dili.</p>
<p>Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labour, had talks in Jakarta this week with officials including Foreign Minister Ali Alatas before flying to Dili.</p>
<p>He said his trip, a rare visit by a senior foreign official to the troubled territory, &quot;emphasises the great importance of East Timor, and human rights generally speaking. I look forward to be able to find out more about the situation&quot;.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded East Timor in December 1975 with tacit Western support after civil war broke out there following the departure of Portuguese colonial authorities.</p>
<p>Indonesia incorporated East Timor as its 27th province the following July in a move not recognised by the United Nations.</p>
<p>In Jakarta, the new U.N. envoy on East Timor, Pakistan's Jamsheed Marker, arrived on Thursday on what the U.N. has called a &quot;familiarisation&quot; trip and was meeting Alatas and President Suharto. Marker will also visit East Timor over the weekend.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said it was purely a coincidence that Shattuck and Marker were in Indonesia at the same time. Shattuck had rescheduled his visit because of family reasons.</p>
<p>The spotlight was also on East Timor this week with the installation on Wednesday of a new bishop, after Pope John Paul split the territory's diocese into two late last year.</p>
<p>Maurilio Gouveia, archbishop of Evera in Portugal, conducted the ceremony installing Bishop Basilio do Nascimkento as the apostolic administrator of the new diocese of Baucau at the eastern end of the territory.</p>
<p>The other bishop is the popular co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, Carlos Belo.</p>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Marker as his special assistant for East Timor last month.</p>
<p>U.N.-sponsored talks between Indonesia and Portugal seeing a settlement on East Timor's future have dragged on for nearly 15 years. Marker said during a visit to Lisbon early this month that he hoped the talks could be speeded up.</p>
<p>Diplomats from the region have questioned how successful the talks could be, however. They noted Indonesia had made it clear it regards East Timor as an integral part of its territory.</p>
<p>One senior diplomat from the region said a possible solution was a measure of autonomy for East Timor's 850,000 people. &quot;The solution is some type of autonomy, but there has been a lack of ways to achieve this,&quot; he said.</p>
