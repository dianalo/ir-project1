<p>Northern Ireland, the most contentious issue on the agenda of any Irish government, was entrusted to 53-year-old Ray Burke when Prime Minister Bertie Ahern appointed him Foreign Affairs minister on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;He's a safe pair of hands, a very astute man who does not make mistakes in parliament. He weighs his words. It's a clever appointment,&quot; one political contemporary said.</p>
<p>Burke was Foreign Affairs spokesman in opposition and has served as Minister for Justice and Communication, Industry and Commerce and Energy and Communications between 1987 and 1991.</p>
<p>His promotion by Ahern is reward for a stalwart of the Fianna Fail party, the biggest in Irish politics, and for a political associate linked to his power base in North Dublin.</p>
<p>Burke, Ahern and former Prime Minister Charles Haughey were the leaders of what was jokingly referred to as Fianna Fail's &quot;North Dublin mafia&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>It was a powerful bloc in the party but it lost its ascendancy when Albert Reynolds came to power until his coalition collapsed in late 1994.</p>
<p>Reynolds brought with him his own coterie of supporters but when he was forced to step down in a scandal over legal appointments it brought Ahern, then Finance Minister, to the leadership of the party and marked Burke's return.</p>
<p>Burke's promotion will put him in the public eye as often as Ahern as Ireland and its British partners seek to keep alive a peace process for Northern Ireland in which Reynolds had a shaping hand in late 1993.</p>
<p>Long-stalled by mistrust between Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant Unionists and pro-Irish nationalists, the year-old talks received an injection of fresh political thinking on Wednesday from the new British government.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave Sinn Fein, political wing of Irish Republican Army guerrillas, a formal offer to join Belfast peace talks if the IRA calls an end to its war against British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Burke's task, political sources said, will be to maximise the opportunity to solve the biggest and oldest problem on Ireland's political agenda and to build a solid working relationship with Blair's administration.</p>
<p>Fianna Fail sees itself as the natural party of Irish republicans who want to see a united Ireland but has put a cool distance between itself and Sinn Fein because of IRA violence.</p>
<p>Burke will have to steer a course between championing the rights of the Catholic pro-Irish minority in Northern Ireland while pressing the IRA to abandon for good the guerrilla war which lies at the heart of the Northern Ireland conflict.</p>
<p>He succeeds Dick Spring, probably Ireland's best-known international figure after President Mary Robinson, who worked with the previous British government of John Major.</p>
<p>As Foreign Affairs minister he represents Ireland in a standing Anglo-Irish conference which oversees the peace process and Northern Ireland affairs since 1985.</p>
