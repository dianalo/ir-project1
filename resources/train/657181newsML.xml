<p>Envirodyne Industries Inc. said Thursday it has received a takeover offer worth about $652 million from a director and a former chairman of the food packaging and foodservice supplies company.</p>
<p>The cash bid of $8.50 a share is being made through HK Acquisitions Corp., which was formed by Michael Heisley, a director of Envirodyne, and Donald Kelly, the company's former chairman, president and chief executive.</p>
<p>The purchase price includes about $127 million in cash for equity and the assumption of $525 million of debt, it said.</p>
<p>Envirodyne's stock rose 93.75 cents to $8.1875 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Envirodyne said the offer was made in a letter requiring a response from the company by June 18.</p>
<p>Envirodyne must pay HK Acquisitions a $10 million fee if it agrees to be acquired and then calls off the deal due to an alternative transaction.</p>
<p>In May, Zapata Corp. said it terminated its $8 a share proposal to acquire all of Envirodyne's common stock that it did not already own.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company said Envirodyne has no other pending acquisition offers.</p>
<p>Envirodyne said HK Acquisition's bid will be submitted to a committee of independent directors, which will evaluate it and make a recommendation to the board of directors.</p>
<p>The deal is subject to negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, approval by the board and stockholders of Envirodyne, and antitrust regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Envirodyne's principal subsidiaries are Viskase Corp., Clear Shield National Inc. and Sandusky Plastics Inc. They make meat packaging products; heat shrinkable plastic bags and speciality plastic films; disposable plastic cutlery, drinking straws and custom dining kits; and plastic containers for cultured dairy products.</p>
