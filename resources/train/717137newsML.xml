<p>The Association of Energy Suppliers (AES), a new body set up to protect gas and electricity consumers from sharp sales practices by sellers, said on Wednesday it had signed up its first members.</p>
<p>Seeboard  and Beacon Gas, the joint venture gas company between Seeboard and Amoco, have become the first companies to sign up to the AES Code of Practice for Marketing since its launch on June 25.</p>
<p>The code deals with selling methods before customers have signed contracts to buy either gas or electricity from new suppliers.</p>
<p>The U.K. domestic gas market has been opening to competition gradually since April 1996, and will be fully opened by June next year. The electricity market will open from next April, so selling techniques have become a pressing issue with a number of complaints already received by the gas industry.</p>
<p>An AES spokeswoman said membership costs less than 2,000 stg a year, and most suppliers of gas and electricity were expected to join. The AES is designed to give customers a guarantee that, in the event of a complaint which cannot be resolved by the company in question, there is a supervisory body to turn to.</p>
<p>The AES's sanctions include giving harmful publicity to companies which do not abide by its code, and ultimately expulsion, with all the bad publicity that would bring, she said.</p>
