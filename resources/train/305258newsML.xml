<p>South Africa sought on Tuesday to defuse a row with the United States over a proposed arms sale to Syria, saying a final decision was still far off and that it was not alone in bidding for the deal.</p>
<p>A statement from the department of foreign affairs issued late in the day after a high-level meeting of ministry officials took a more conciliatory line than remarks earlier by President Nelson Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana.</p>
<p>Mankahlana, responding to a U.S. threat to cut aid to South Africa if the three billion rand ($641 million) sale of tank-gun aiming gear went ahead, accused Washington of high-handed bullying.</p>
<p>&quot;We detest this kind of behaviour,&quot; he said. &quot;We just don't like being shouted at.&quot;</p>
<p>Mankahlana said South Africa was a sovereign country. &quot;The Americans are not going to guide us, they are not going to tell us what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. state department said on Monday it would view extremely seriously any sale of arms to Syria, which it accuses of sponsoring terrorism.</p>
<p>Reports of the sale, believed to involve upgrading the targeting ability of Soviet-built T-72 tanks, were leaked to South African newspapers at the weekend.</p>
<p>The South African department of foreign affairs, in Pretoria's first full official statement on the deal, said a local company &quot;was involved in a process of marketing an electronic tank sighting system in Syria&quot; along with companies from at least three European countries.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that any tender for the sale of such equipment would be issued between the years 1999 and 2000,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The cabinet and a special committee on arms exports would decide on the issue at that stage, &quot;if the South African company was still interested to submit a bid&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision would be based on guidelines governing the export of conventional weapons, the prevailing situation in the Middle East and the South African government's firm commitment to support the peace process in the region,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Mandela's government has set what it calls strict moral conditions on the sale of arms, saying it would not export them to trouble spots or to countries that abuse human rights.</p>
<p>The U.S. statement on Monday was the most heated yet issued by Washington in regard to its differences with Pretoria over foreign policy and arms sales.</p>
<p>Former president F.W. de Klerk's opposition National Party urged Mandela's government to veto the sale. &quot;Mere common sense indicates that South Africa cannot afford to become gradually alienated from the only superpower in the world through short-sighted and poor decision-making,&quot; a statement said.</p>
<p>The United States has previously reproached South Africa for its warm ties with Cuba, Libya and Iran. Tehran is negotiating an oil storage deal with South Africa.</p>
<p>South African government officials had previously said in response to the weekend newspaper reports that a decision on the targeting equipment for Syria would be taken at a cabinet meeting later this month.</p>
<p>Israel's ambassador, Victor Harel, said the proposed sale would be &quot;destabilising&quot;. Harel said he had been assured there was no change in relations but if the deal went ahead, it would burden relations and damage the Middle East peace process.</p>
