<p>Japan's Ricoh Co Ltd said on Monday it would soon launch a digital camera which will be able to transmit data through the personal handyphone system (PHS) as well as along standard phone lines.</p>
<p>Ricoh said the DC-2S would be the first digital camera to be able to send pictures in the form of digital data on the PHS phone system into a host machine such as a computer or another digital camera.</p>
<p>PHS, which is increasingly popular in Japan, is a mobile phone technology which is cheaper than standard cellular phones but has a smaller range.</p>
<p>The new camera, which was developed for business use, will be launched in late July in Japan and will cost 108,000 yen ($939), the company said.</p>
<p>The camera, like other models already on the market, can also transmit data through standard cellular phone systems and public phone circuits.</p>
<p>Digital cameras are proving popular with consumers as they are compact, making them easy to carry, and the pictures can be transferred easily as digital data into computers without the need for processing or expensive scanning devices.</p>
<p>The Ricoh model features a 410,000-pixel charge-coupled device (CCD), the camera's &quot;electronic eye&quot;. It can use a built-in four megabyte flash memory as well as a removable flash memory card.</p>
<p>The pocket-sized camera weighs 285 grams (10 ounces).</p>
<p>Ricoh said it expects to produce 3,000 of the cameras per month.</p>
<p>It said digital cameras which enable transmission of images by phone are used by insurance companies which send pictures from car accidents back to their offices for assessment.</p>
<p>Major Japanese insurance companies, including Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co Ltd and Koa Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co Ltd, are currently using such systems, Ricoh said.</p>
