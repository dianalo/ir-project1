<p>SIMEX Euroyen futures made headway on Thursday as Japanese government bond (JGB) futures reached new highs on active cash bond buying and a sharp drop in Tokyo stocks.</p>
<p>Dealers said seasonal demand ahead of the Japanese financial year end on March 31 and favourable supply and demand conditions lifted cash JGBs.</p>
<p>&quot;With interest rates at an all-time low and the Nikkei not doing well due to bank failures and scandals at securities houses, there's nowhere else to park your funds,&quot; said a trader with a U.S. futures house.  </p>
<p>Late afternoon rumours that Daiwa Securities Co Ltd was being inspected by Japan's securities' watchdog also supported bond buying, but Daiwa told Reuters it was undergoing a routine inspection, not a special check.</p>
<p>December Euroyen stood at 99.22 at 1110 GMT against its IMM close at 99.19 on volume of 5,800 lots. June JGBs ended at 126.29 against their previous 125.78 after surging to a new high of 126.38.</p>
<p>&quot;Euroyen could make some more advances and try the old highs of 99.28 for December,&quot; said the trader.  </p>
<p>A Japanese bank dealer said the contract would need to reach above resistance at 99.23 to head higher.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures finished lower as players adjusted their positions ahead of the release of U.S. retail sales data for February at 1330 GMT.</p>
<p>The Japanese bank dealer said the market would be increasingly nervous about inflationary signals ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy setting meeting on March 25.</p>
<p>June Eurodollars were most actively traded and finished at 94.180 against their IMM close at 94.190. September were at 93.970 against 93.980.</p>
