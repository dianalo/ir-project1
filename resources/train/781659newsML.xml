<p>An Australian broadcaster may buy the leftover assets of the TVNZ regional stations in the hope of relaunching regional television in New Zealand within the next year, the New Zealand Herald newspaper reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Prime TV, which operates 14 regional stations in Australia, says it has yet to decide what sort of programmes it will broadcast, but it promises a heavy emphasis on local news.</p>
<p>The network hopes to begin UHF broadcasting from about the middle of next year, using a set of licences it bought from a Christian broadcasting group for just over NZ$4 million.  </p>
<p>Former Horizon Pacific Television (HPTV) chief Trevor Egerton will head the company in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Egerton said that he believed TVNZ had made a mistake in axing the regional channels.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply put, Prime and ourselves have recognised a long-term potential that somebody else let go -- they probably didn't quite appreciate what they had,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Prime TV managing director, George Brown, said it was too early to say what the company planned to do with the licences, which cover 89 percent of the country.  </p>
<p>However, Prime hoped to begin broadcasting in the main centres from the middle of next year, whether or not it decided to buy Horizon Pacific's assets, he said.</p>
<p>Brown said he expected the network would employ between 50 and 200 New Zealanders, and would begin broadcasting 24 hours a day from day one. It planned to show Australian, British and American programmes, and would have a strong emphasis on local news.</p>
<p>TV3 managing director Graeme Hunter described the Prime move as very brave.  </p>
<p>&quot;It sounds to me very much like a repeat of the failed HPTV,&quot; he said. &quot;It defies me to see how they can reapproach it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that with TVNZ and TV3 already holding the rights to a large number of overseas programmes, it also begged the question of what type of programmes the network intended to show.</p>
