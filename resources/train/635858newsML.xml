<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Pre-jobs data lull hits indices.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Trading in major U.S. stock index options was fairly quiet Wednesday as investors continued to move to the sidelines ahead of a key economic report on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's kind of a mid-week drift until we get the next big number, which is Friday,&quot; an options broker in Chicago said. &quot;We're in a mid-week lull here.&quot;</p>
<p>In late trading, the Dow industrial average .DJI was down 43 points at 7,269. The broader S&amp;P 500 index .SPX fell 5.40 to 840.08 and the S&amp;P 100 .OEX lost 6.68 to 820.16.</p>
<p>June S&amp;P 500 futures were down 2.35 at 840.80.  </p>
<p>On Friday, the May U.S. employment report is scheduled for release before the stock market opens.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you'll probably see something happen after that number comes out on Friday, at least for a couple of hours afterward,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>He added that Fridays lately have been fairly volatile.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the market fell sharply in early trading only to recoup its losses and close a touch firmer.</p>
<p>Traders said volatilities in major stock index options continued to hold firm in anticipation of the jobs report and the market's potential reaction to the data.  </p>
<p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index .VIX was up 0.25, or 1.1 percent, at 22.72. On Tuesday, the VIX, which is priced off certain near-month OEX options, rose nearly a point before closing 0.55 higher.</p>
<p>Traders said volatility would likely remain on an upward path through Thursday and could drop sharply Friday.</p>
<p>Among OEX options, the busiest was the June 820 put, which traded nearly 9,450 contracts. The June 810 put traded 6,575 and the June 800 put traded 4,230, rounding out the most active puts.  </p>
<p>The OEX June 820 call was most active call, with turnover of 5,280 contracts. The June 830 call traded nearly 3,700 contracts and the June 840 call traded 2,245.</p>
<p>In the SPX, the heaviest action was on the put side, led by the June 805, which traded 4,175 contracts. The June 835 put traded 3,815 and the June 800 put traded nearly 3,000.</p>
<p>On the call side, the June 880 was most active, with turnover of about 2,955 contracts. The June 890 call traded 2,435.</p>
