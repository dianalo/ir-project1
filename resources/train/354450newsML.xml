<title>USA: CBOT March corn down as Tenco, Refco sell.</title>
<headline>CBOT March corn down as Tenco, Refco sell.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volume was thin and selling by Tenco Inc and Refco Inc was tied to a quiet decline in CBOT March corn by midsession, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just a very dull trade and a lack of news,&quot; said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co in describing the tone in the corn pit.</p>
<p>Tenco sold three million bushels of March and Refco sold two million March, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn was underpinned by gains in soybeans but pressured by a drop to new contract lows in March wheat and the export picture for corn remained cloudy.</p>
<p>Taiwan and South Korea overnight bought U.S. corn.</p>
<p>Taiwan bought 54,000 tonnes of U.S. corn and South Korea bought 52,500 tonnes of U.S. corn, export sources said.</p>
<p>Small-lot bear spreading boosted deferred contracts. The U.S. Feed Grains Council Tuesday said U.S. corn production will rise modestly to 9.490 billion bushels this year.</p>
<p>Technicians cited first support in March corn at $2.68-1/2 a bushel. The session low was $2.68 as of midsession.The four- and 20-day moving averages were bullish early Tuesday, chartists reported.</p>
<p>At 1135 CST, corn was 1/2 cent per bushel lower to 1-3/4 cents higher, with March down 1/2 at $2.69 cents.</p>
