<p>Wall Street stocks are expected to head lower at the open Wednesday after the Dow industrials eked out another record close yesterday.</p>
<p>Analysts pointed to the divergence between a handful of strong blue chips and the overall market, saying that buying interest may slip away from the large cap area to small and medium cap issues.</p>
<p>&quot;The divergence is a result of index funds which have to buy blue chips,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, analyst at Prudential Securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;The money does not leave the market,&quot; Wachtel said.  &quot;It will have to seek new outlets.  I think we are in for a period of time during which we will see the Dow underperform and the secondaries come up a touch.  The mania so far has been not in the overall Dow, but in about 10 of the 30 components.&quot;</p>
<p>Since January 22, when the Nasdaq Composite closed at a record level of 1,388.06, the Dow has risen 235.13 points, or 3.4 percent, hitting a new high of 7.085.16 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But during the same period, the Nasdaq has dropped 71.3 points or 5.19 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that the indices give you a snapshot with a narrow focus.  If the breadth and volume hold up there is interest in the market,&quot; Wachtel said.  &quot;If people want to focus on those 30 stocks, that's their business.  That's not my market.  You have to look for the proper group to go into.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that utilities, pharmaceutical and financial issues looked tired while aluminum stocks looked strong. Among the high techs, networking companies were taking a beating while semiconductors were doing relatively well.</p>
<p>Wall Street is again worrying about interest rates and what the March 25 FOMC meeting will bring, he said.  </p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei Average was down 85.45 points, or 0.46 percent, at 18,183.27.</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 Index was down 9.5 at 4434.8.</p>
<p>Among U.S. shares traded in London, Cisco Systems Inc, which dropped $5/8 to $52-3/4 on Tuesday, was up $1/8 to $52-7/8 but trading volume was thin.</p>
<p>The dollar was higher but off its peak in Tokyo and easier against the mark in Europe.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were mostly lower, with the long bond down 1/32 to yield 6.86 percent.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street writes that bondholders cheered on Friday when Ronald Perelman turned the reins over to Carl Icahn in his fight for control over Marvel Entertainment Group because the Perelman-Icahn pact means the bondholders stand a chance of keeping their equity stake in the beleaguered marketer of comic books and trading cards.</p>
<p>But Marvel's banks, led by Chase Manhattan Bank, aren't quite as happy with the plan, saying people close to the transaction, becuase they could lose an important source of repayment on their $630 million in Marvel bank debt.  </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has sharply rebuked the Philadelphia Stock Exchange after two recent scandals involving members of the exchange's board.  In an unusual visit to Philadelphia, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt accused the board members of spending more time fighting among themselves than overseeing their regulatory responsibilties.</p>
