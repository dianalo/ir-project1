<title>USA: Airline stocks sink on Goldman downgrade -analysts.</title>
<headline>Airline stocks sink on Goldman downgrade -analysts.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Airline stocks dropped sharply in Thursday morning trade in the wake of a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange airline index lost 9.41 points or 2.01 percent to 459.15. The Dow Jones transportation average shed almost 18 points or 0.65 percent to 2720.</p>
<p>Goldman analyst Glenn Engel removed AMR Corp from the recommended list and rated the stock as market outperform. Engel also removed Delta Air Lines Inc from the priority list and cut UAL Corp to market perform from market outperform. Delta remains on the recommended list.  </p>
<p>Engel could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Other industry analysts said Goldman Sachs raised concerns about ticket tax proposals that have emerged from Congress.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee have proposed conflicting plans that would increase taxes on the airline industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Two distinct proposals have emerged. The only thing they have in common is that they would raise taxes for the industry,&quot; said Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst with PaineWebber.  </p>
<p>Buttrick said the Senate proposal would be &quot;more onerous&quot; to airlines with international operations, such as AMR Corp's American, UAL's United and Northwest Airlines Corp.</p>
<p>Based on very preliminary data, PaineWebber said it expects the Senate proposal, in the first year, would increase the domestic airline industry's tax burden by $1.1 billion over current levels and $700 million over the House proposal.</p>
<p>Other analysts said concerns about changes in the excise tax are premature, since the proposals will likely change significantly before a final tax plan is enacted.</p>
