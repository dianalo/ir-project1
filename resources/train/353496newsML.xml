<headline>Britain confirms death of U.N. worker in Rwanda.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The British government confirmed on Tuesday that a Briton was one of four United Nations employees who were killed in an ambush in Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;We are deeply shocked by this incident and all our sympathy goes to the families of the victims and their co-workers,&quot; a spokesman for the Foreign Office told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in close touch with the U.N. authorities in Kigali and in New York. We are seeking more information on the incident and we understand the U.N. will issue a press statement shortly,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>U.N. human rights spokeswoman in Kigali, Marie Vander Elst, said earlier on Tuesday that the four were conducting their normal duties as part of a human rights monitoring team in the commune of Karengera approximately 350 km (200 miles) southwest of Kigali on the Zairean border when they were attacked.</p>
<p>The bodies of the victims were due to be flown to Kigali on Tuesday night. No other details were available.</p>
<p>It was the latest in a series of attacks on foreigners in Rwanda. Six foreigners have died in the escalting violence, including a Canadian priest who was killed by an unidentified gunman on Sunday.</p>
<p>A Rwandan official suggested hardline hardline Hutus who fled Rwanda after committing genocide against minority Tutsis in 1994 could be involved.</p>
