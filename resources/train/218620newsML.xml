<p>Wesfarmers Ltd said on Tuesday that it expected earnings per share (eps) growth this financial year to be above six percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We will get more than that this year,&quot; chief executive Michael Chaney told reporters after addressing the Securities Institute of Australia.</p>
<p>Chaney was referring to Wesfarmers' long-term goal of six percent real eps growth per year.  </p>
<p>Earlier Chaney repeated forecasts made earlier this month that Wesfarmers expected a rebound in profits for the full 1996/97 year after a 27.4 percent drop in net profits to A$92.79 percent in the year to June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>He also said that full year growth would be less than the 65 percent profit growth recorded in the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p>Asked whether Wesfarmers agreed with analysts 1996/97 forecasts for a net profit before abnormals of about A$110 million to A$115 million, Chaney said he could not comment, except to say that: &quot;We always, like all companies, endeavour to make sure that analysts aren't too far out.&quot;  </p>
<p>Chaney said the profit growth in the current year was being driven by Wesfarmer's energy, fertilisers and chemicals divisions.</p>
<p>Chaney also said earlier Perth-based Wesfarmers saw similar real growth in earnings before interest and tax over the next four to five years as that experienced between 1991 and 1996.</p>
<p>He said Wesfarmers had achieved five percent real EPS growth between 1987 and 1996 and Wesfarmers aimed to achieve six percent real growth over rolling five year periods in the future.</p>
