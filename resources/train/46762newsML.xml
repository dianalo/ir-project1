<title>FRANCE: French pension debate to focus on shares, payouts.</title>
<headline>French pension debate to focus on shares, payouts.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Debate on the launch of pension funds in France is likely to focus on whether these should make payouts in annuities or a lump sum and on whether they should be required to make a minimum investment in shares.</p>
<p>Government sources said a parliamentary debate due this autumn on the introduction of pension funds will be based on a draft bill drawn up in 1994 by then parliamentary deputies Jacques Barrot, Charles Millon and Jean-Pierre Thomas, rather than on proposals drawn up by Finance Minister Jean Arthuis.</p>
<p>Discussion about the introduction of pension funds is being closely watched by financial markets, interested to see whether it affects the allocation of assets between stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>A decision to base the debate on the parliamentary draft bill will focus discussion on whether pension funds should be required to make a minimum investment in shares -- favoured by the parliamentary draft but not by Arthuis' proposals.</p>
<p>The government is expected to try to amend the bill, arguing that since pension funds paying out annuities would automatically favour shares as a better long-term investment, no minimum requirement is necessary.</p>
<p>Both the draft bill and the finance minister's proposals favour external independent management of pension funds, which would be set up on a voluntary basis by companies and employees to complement the existing universal pension system.</p>
<p>Debate on any minimum investment in shares will add to discussion, reopened by Prime Minister Alain Juppe on Monday, on whether payouts should be in annuities only, or whether there would be an option to take the money in a lump sum.</p>
<p>Juppe said the government was open to discussion on its proposal that payouts be limited to annuities only.</p>
<p>&quot;At retirement age, one could have an annuity which improved the basic pension...or otherwise -- I am not completely opposed to this idea -- a lump sum which for example would allow someone who is retiring to sell their apartment in town in order to buy a retirement house in the country,&quot; Juppe told French radio.</p>
<p>French banks have pushed for pension funds to be able to pay out money in a lump sum, whereas insurance companies want the payout to be in the form of annuities.</p>
<p>Government sources say the tax regime for the new pension funds, due to be included in a 1997 budget to be presented on September 18, is more or less agreed.</p>
<p>Assuming payouts are in the form of annuities only, contributions to pension funds would be deductible against income and corporate tax, while payouts would be taxable.</p>
<p>The new funds would be independent incorporated companies subject to prudential rules governing insurance companies.</p>
<p>But the government plans to modify, for the new pension funds only, rules which currently discourage investment in shares. These rules require provisions to be made each year for capital losses on shares but not on bonds.</p>
<p>Parliament is expected to debate the bill on pension funds after the 1997 budget. The modification of prudential rules would be made afterwards, by decree.</p>
