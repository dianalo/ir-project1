<p>Former world middleweight boxing champion Tony Zale, whose three epic bouts against Rocky Graziano in the mid-1940s were considered among the sport's most memorable, has died.</p>
<p>Zale, 83, born Anthony Florian Zaleski, had suffered from cancer and died on Thursday in a nursing home here not far from his birthplace, Gary, Indiana, a family spokesman said.</p>
<p>Nicknamed &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; because he spent time working in Gary's steel mills between bouts, Zale was known as a ferocious body-puncher who won the middleweight crown in 1940. His career halted by a four-year stint in the U.S. Navy during the Seond World War, he returned to the ring to beat Graziano in two of their three fights.</p>
<p>American Sportswriter Red Smith wrote in 1968, &quot;Ask any fight buff of the late 1940s to name the most memorable series fought in his time, and without hesitation he will say the Zale-Graziano battles of 1946, 1947, 1948.&quot;</p>
<p>Three months after his last victory over Graziano, Zale lost to Marcel Cerdan and retired at age 35 with a record of 67 wins, 18 losses and two draws.</p>
