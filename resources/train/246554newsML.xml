<p>Spot bulk electricity prices in the southeastern U.S. were mixed Wednesday, stalled by sluggish activity amid forecasts for above-normal temperatures through the end of the week and a return of some nuclear power, sources said.</p>
<p>Firm, peak power prices in the northern part of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) territory for Wednesday delivery were talked in the $21.00-22.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) range, down about $1 from Monday's trading range.</p>
<p>Late deals into TVA were reported done as low as $15.50 and $16.00.</p>
<p>TVA's 1,148 megawatt (MW) Sequoyah 2 nuclear unit in Soddy-Daisy, Tenn., returned to full power early Tuesday.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak electricity in northern TVA was assessed around $14.50, mostly unchanged from Monday.</p>
<p>At the Georgia/Florida border, prices for firm, peak electricity in 16 hour blocks for Wednesday delivery were quoted in the $22.50-$24.80 per MWh range, with the bulk of business done around $23.50-24.00.</p>
<p>These prices compare with Monday's market in the $22.00-23.00 per MWh area.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak power for Wednesday at the Ga./Fla. border was notionally assessed at $16.00-16.50.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Southeast are expected to warm to above-normal levels on Wednesday and Thursday but then return to more seasonable levels this weekend.</p>
<p>Separately, Duke Power's 1,129 MW Catawba nuclear power unit in Clover, S.C., was operating at full power Tuesday.</p>
