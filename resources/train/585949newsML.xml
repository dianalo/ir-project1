<p>The next, and probably final, round of talks between Tajikistan's government and Islamist opposition will be held in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek on Saturday, a spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;President Imomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri will negotiate in Bishkek on May 17,&quot; Zafar Saidov, spokesman to the Tajik president, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Saidov said Rakhmonov and Nuri could reach an agreement on legalising several major political parties, as well as opposition press. They were also expected to discuss security guarantees for the opposition and its leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;If Rakhmonov and Nuri reach agreements on all these issues, a final peace treaty... could be signed in Bishkek without waiting for another meeting of experts in Tehran,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last December Rakhmonov's secular government and the Central Asian state's Islamist opposition agreed on a ceasefire to end a four-year civil war which killed tens of thousands of people and drove many more from their homes.</p>
<p>The ceasefire was brokered by the United Nations, Russia and Iran. Military terms for a peace deal and a power-sharing agreement have been agreed. Legalisation of the opposition is the main outstanding issue.</p>
