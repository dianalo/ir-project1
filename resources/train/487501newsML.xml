<p>Salomon Brothers said it had raised its recommendation on Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd to buy from hold and increased its earnings per share forecast by seven percent for 1997 and by five percent for 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason for the upgrade in earnings, estimated NAV and recommendation, to buy from hold, is the rescheduling of Sun Hung Kai's development programme, to accelerate residential development and delay its industrial property development,&quot; analyst Michael Green said in a recent research report.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch forecasts net income of HK$13.78 billion for the year to June 30, 1997, up from a previous estimate of HK$12.84 billion, and earnings per share of HK$5.77.</p>
<p>It estimates net income of HK$16.39 billion the year to June 30, 1998 and earnings per share of HK$6.86.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch also raised the company's estimated net asset value (NAV) to HK$97.68 from HK$90.89. &quot;There is room for further increases,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch said the pattern of Sun Hung Kai Properties' interim results and its completion schedule indicated that its residential development programme was being accelerated and its industrial building programme delayed.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Properties posted a 21 percent rise in interim net profit last month to HK$6.25 billion. It said it expected to complete 2.6 million square feet of properties in the second half of the current financial year of which 2.1 million would consist of residential properties.</p>
<p>&quot;An acceleration of the residential development programme should generate cash internally for land premia for agricultural land conversions. The shortage of supply over the next three to four years should provide the platform for wide margins,&quot; Merrill Lynch said.</p>
<p>It said the discount at which the stock was trading to its net asset value &quot;represents good value for such a high-quality company&quot;.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Properties shares rose HK$1.00 to close at HK$78.00 on Friday.</p>
