<title>USA: NYMEX oil sector ends higher, crude rallies late.</title>
<headline>NYMEX oil sector ends higher, crude rallies late.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX crude oil futures and unleaded gasoline rallied at the close of trading to settle broadly higher Wednesday on late reports that Turkish forces had staged another incursion across the border of Iraq.</p>
<p>Heating oil, taking a back seat to the rest of the action, ended mostly firmer, with only the nearby June contract settling lower.</p>
<p>July crude oil rose 27 cents, settling at $21.86 a barrel on its first session as the spot month, after trading in a $21.95-$21.46 range. Nearby August settled one cent higher, at $21.87 a barrel.</p>
<p>News of the Mideast hostility centered on the possible capture by the Turkish forces of an an important valley, and caused a fresh wave of short covering and brought in a few new longs in crude, traders said.</p>
<p>Unleaded gasoline matched the crude rally, settling with broad gains after what was a choppy session for the whole complex. The July unleaded gas ended at 64.87 cents a gallon, up 0.56 cent, trading in a 64.95-63.75 range.</p>
<p>The spot June contract, which now has fewer lots of open interest than July, rose more sharply - up 1.14 cents - as it approaches expiration period next week.</p>
<p>Despite the belief shared by many that crude's price is too high, the market has been unable to sustain a downward move and the structure of the board is very close to backwardation, suggesting nearby tightness.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over political situations in key producing nations and scattered refinery troubles this week were also keeping sellers at bay, traders said.</p>
<p>On the crude front, one investment bank was said to have to entered a bid of $21.86 for 1,000 lots of July, which triggered a strong wave of short covering, according to floor brokers.</p>
<p>Also supporting the crude market were weekly inventory figures showing crude stocks fell by over 5 million barrels last week to 315.8 million.</p>
<p>Traders said the influence of the data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) was mild at best, noting that last week's report of sharply rising crude stocks was met with a rally and had little of the bearish impact expected.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't hit $22.50 (basis July) very soon, then the top has been put in,&quot; said one unimpressed oil company analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're probably running out time,&quot; she said. &quot;There are too many people out there ready to sell $22 crude. There's a lot of crude and product around, and U.S. refiners can crank out as much gas as they need for the season. I can't get too excited on the upside here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think crude is headed to $18 a barrel. We're swimming in the stuff,&quot; said A.G. Edwards analyst Bill O'Grady.</p>
<p>In unleaded trade, the spot June contract, which now has fewer lots of open interest than July, rose more sharply - up 1.14 cents - as it approaches expiration period next week.</p>
<p>One trader said Wednesday's DOE report was being construed as bullish for gasoline prices, as unleaded traders wonder what happened to this year's annual spring rally ahead of the peak driving season.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of shorts in June, in the June/July (spread), and the June heat-to-gas spread. The (DOE) stats the were bullish. We've got stocks (millions of barrels) under last year's total, and driving season right around the corner,&quot; he said, adding that traders are &quot;starting to realize gas should lead around here.&quot;</p>
<p>Gasoline stocks in the DOE report stood at 198.7 million barrels for the week ended May 16, up 400,000 barrels from the prior week. Gasoline stocks totaled 204 million barrels in the same week one year ago.</p>
<p>Heating oil futures ended with slight gains after falling sharply around midday. July rose 0.01 cent to settle at 57.68 cents a gallon, traded between 58.00 and 56.75.</p>
<p>The heat market had few short-term features and was seen as moving primarily for technical reasons. The longer-term outlook called for seasonal weakness as the market enters a period of rising inventories, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Heating oil is coming into its seasonal build period, and it looks like we're starting a couple of weeks early,&quot; one trader said.</p>
