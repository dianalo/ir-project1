<p>Hurricane Lili swept over Cuba on Friday bringing high winds and dumping heavy rains over western and central areas, then took a cruel turn back over the island just as it looked set to head off out to sea.</p>
<p>The storm, which killed at least 10 people when it lashed Central America this week, changed direction during the morning and threatened new areas in Cuba with torrential rain and sustained maximum winds of 75 mph (120 kph).</p>
<p>No casualties were reported so far in Cuba, but at least 20 houses collapsed in the city of Matanzas, 60 miles (100 km) east of Havana, the state news agency AIN said.</p>
<p>Forecasters had confidently predicted during the morning that the storm would head off northeast towards the Bahamas.</p>
<p>At the National Hurricane Centre in Miami, forecasters said a hurricane warning remained in effect for Cuba's mainland from Matanzas province eastward to Camaguey but was discontinued for the area from Havana westward.</p>
<p>Hurricane warnings remained in effect for the central and northwest Bahamas. A tropical storm warning for the Florida Keys was discontinued.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), the centre of Lili was at latitude 22.4, longitude 80.3 west, near the town of Cruces and about 20 miles (32 km) west of the city of Santa Clara.</p>
<p>Miami forecasters said the storm had moved to the east at about 10 mph (16 kph) during the last few hours but was expected to resume an east-northeast track later on Friday, with the eye emerging off Cuba's north coast in the evening.</p>
<p>To the relief of Havana's two million inhabitants, the hurricane set a more easterly course than anticipated after hitting the Isle of Youth to the south late on Thursday. The provinces most affected so far by Lili were Matanzas, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus and Villa Clara.</p>
<p>President Fidel Castro set off early on Friday to visit a town on the south coast threatened by the hurricane. He went on to the city of Matanzas and then Varadero, where he met some of the 7,000 foreign tourists braving the storm.</p>
<p>Authorities on the Isle of Youth said they were assessing damage. A railway line was cut because of fallen trees and there were reports of damage to crops such as bananas.</p>
<p>On the Cuban mainland, sugar cane may also be affected by the hurricane. The cane, a crucial hard currency earner for Cuba, is within two or three months of being harvested.</p>
<p>Havana was a wind-blown ghost town early on Friday. Some streets were littered with tree branches and several electricity poles fell during the night. The state electricity company cut power to most parts of the capital before dawn to minimise damage to power lines during the storm's passage.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, some residents were venturing into the streets, but forecasters said Havana and other northern coastal areas should expect very high seas and possible flooding later in the day. About 3,600 residents of the Malecon sea-front in Havana were evacuated from their homes and tourists at several sea-front hotels were relocated.</p>
<p>State radio said about 75,000 people had been evacuated from vulnerable buildings in Havana despite initial reluctance on the part of many people living in decaying buildings to leave their homes. Overall, about 176,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Cuba and Havana international airport was closed until further notice.</p>
<p>So far the highest death toll was in Nicaragua, where Civil Defence officials said five people had drowned in swollen rivers across the country over the past four days and 200 were left homeless.</p>
<p>In Costa Rica four people were killed in river tragedies and in Honduras a toddler died when his house was washed away in a shantytown on the edge of the capital Tegucigalpa.</p>
