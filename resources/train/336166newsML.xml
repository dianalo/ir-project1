<p>Taiwan on Monday urged South Korea to accept its deal to ship nuclear waste to impoverished North Korea so as not to damage ties further.</p>
<p>Despite increasingly militant protests in South Korea, Taiwan flatly rejected Seoul's appeal to end the deal to ship up to 200,000 barrels of waste to North Korea.</p>
<p>Under a January 11 contract, state utility Taiwan Power Co plans to ship 60,000 barrels of nuclear waste over two years to the Stalinist state, whose own nuclear programme has been at the eye of a political storm.</p>
<p>&quot;The case is a legal and reasonable business activity,&quot; the foreign ministry said. &quot;We hope South Korea can treat Taipower's international business contract with rationality.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan urged South Korea not to cause any &quot;disturbance&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It (South Korea) should not interfere with bilateral affairs between our country and North Korea to avoid further damage of relations between our country and South Korea,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Taipower declined to disclose financial terms, but Taiwan media have said the utility has agreed to pay cash-starved Pyongyang US$1,150 for each barrel it takes.</p>
<p>Taiwan state television, quoting reliable sources, said Pyongyang had sent engineers to Taiwan to inspect the island's ports and that the first nuclear waste might be shipped to North Korea by the end of February.</p>
<p>South Korea, worried that the deal could pollute the Korean peninsula with radioactivity, says there is no verification that the arch rival North can store nuclear waste safely.</p>
<p>Scores of South Korean environmental activists burned Taiwan flags and an effigy of Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday in Seoul as South Korea sought to rally international pressure on Taipei to cancel the Taipei-Pyongyang waste pact.</p>
<p>Taiwan's foreign ministry said it was satisfied that North Korea was capable of handling low-level radioactive nuclear waste and that the contract complied with international regulations.</p>
<p>Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with either North Korea or South Korea, both of which recognise Taiwan's own arch rival -- the communist Chinese government in Beijing.</p>
<p>Taipei and Seoul ended decades of anti-communist solidarity in 1992 after South Korea switched ties to Beijing.</p>
<p>Taiwan opinion was mixed about the government's decision.</p>
<p>In Taipei on Monday, dozens of pro-government protesters burned effigies of South Korean President Kim Young-sam and a South Korean flag, reciprocating for Seoul's weekend protests.</p>
<p>But Taiwan's fledgling New Party echoed South Korea's concern over possible environmental pollution, saying the row would tarnish Taiwan's international image.</p>
<p>Taiwan has three nuclear power plants in operation and a fourth under construction, but has run out of space for the nuclear waste they generate.</p>
<p>Taiwan's only nuclear waste dump, a 98,112-barrel facility on Lanyu island, has room for only 440 more barrels.</p>
