<p>Polish steel mill Huta Olawa SA said it was cutting its 1996 net profit figure to 1.14 million zlotys from the 3.02 million announced earlier, due to tax office decisions on additional income tax owed by the company.</p>
<p>In a statement published on Tuesday, Olawa said it had accepted a decision by the tax office that it owed 3,169 zlotys and had paid the sum.</p>
<p>But the statement said Olawa would appeal against a ruling that it also owed 719,351 zlotys in income tax for 1994, while proceedings were underway concerning 197,460 zlotys for 1995.</p>
<p>The company said it had reduced its net profit by the amount of tax payments which had already been decided and the sums over which there were now proceedings, plus back interest on these sums.</p>
<p>The statement added that Olawa forecast 1997 net profit of 3.83 million zlotys on sales of 61.5 million zlotys. ((-- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700 ))</p>
