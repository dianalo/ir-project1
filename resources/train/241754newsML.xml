<p>Japan and United States began their final day of ministerial talks on a dispute over deregulation of Japan's insurance market after failing to settle differences the day before, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky met briefly in the morning followed by working-level talks between Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the Ministry of Finance's International Finance Bureau, and senior U.S. negotiator Ira Shapiro.</p>
<p>The negotiations began on Friday.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton has described the dispute as the biggest trade problem between the two countries with threats of U.S. sanctions if a deal is not reached.</p>
<p>According to Japan's NHK Television, both sides put forward new proposals during the morning meeting in an effort to resolve the issue before the December 15 deadline.</p>
<p>Asked whether new proposals have been made, Shapiro told reporters: &quot;We are studying it now.&quot;</p>
<p>The disagreement centres on U.S. charges that Japan is planning to renege on a 1994 trade agreement on the deregulation of its $400 billion insurance market.</p>
<p>Washington has argued that the agreement calls for Tokyo to deregulate the huge primary life and casualty insurance sector, which is dominated by Japanese companies, before unleashing competition in the tiny specialty insurance market.</p>
<p>The niche market is the only one in which foreign insurance groups have a firm foothold.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance officials have said that this is likely to be the last chance for ministerial level talks before the deadline because of the tight schedule of both ministers.</p>
<p>Barshefsky was scheduled to leave Japan late on Saturday to attend the World Trade Organisation gathering in Singapore, which starts on Monday and ends on December 13.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka must be in Tokyo to attend the extraordinary session of the parliament which ends on December 18, MOF officials said.</p>
