<p>Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said on Wednesday that there were no &quot;secret deals&quot; to keep Italy out of the start of Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>He was responding to a report in the business daily Il Sole 24 Ore that a deal was taking shape between France and Germany to keep Italy, and with it Spain, out of the first wave of countries hoping to join economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;I exclude that there are prejudicial attitudes against Italy and that there are secret accords,&quot; Ciampi told reporters.</p>
<p>France also rejected the report. &quot;It's totally absurd,&quot; a French finance ministery official said.</p>
<p>Il Sole, quoting &quot;sources in Bonn&quot;, said France had come round to the idea of keeping Italy and Spain out of the group of EMU founders because it feared Germany would otherwise insist on a two-year delay in the currency's planned January 1999 launch.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to the threat, still latent, of a two-year delay in the euro, Bonn has managed in the last weeks to convince Paris of the importance that Germany attaches to the temporary exclusion of Italy from the first group of single currency countries,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;But since it is considered politically too risky to abandon Italy as the only excluded one together with Greece, (the idea of) similar treatment for Spain is gaining ground,&quot; the report added.</p>
<p>Italy is struggling to wrestle its public sector borrowing requirement down to three percent of gross domestic product by the end of the year in an effort to meet a key qualifying criteria for EMU.</p>
<p>But there have been doubts as to the sustainability of the deficit-cutting measures imposed by Italy in recent months.</p>
<p>Ciampi acknowledged the doubts on Wednesday, saying Italy's effort to slash its deficit-GDP ratio by some four percentage points from 1996 to 1997 was &quot;some undertaking&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The doubts they have is to have a country in there with them whose continued behaviour is open to doubt,&quot; Ciampi said.</p>
<p>But he said it was important to have as many countries joining the euro as possible. &quot;The strength of the (euro) is not so much a matter of how small it will be or how close to the deutschmark but how broad it will be,&quot; Ciampi said.</p>
<p>The European Monetary Institute (EMI) in an annual report released on Tuesday lashed out at one-off measures to reduce deficit to GDP ratios, saying they &quot;cannot be regarded as contributing to sustainability&quot;.</p>
<p>It did not specifically mention Italy, which has resorted mainly to a special &quot;Euro-tax&quot; and revenue-raising measures in its 1997 budget and a recent supplementary budget for this year to keep the deficit in check.</p>
<p>The centre-left government now wants to tackle the structural problem of welfare spending, in particular its bloated pensions bill, but faces stiff resistance from its key ally in parliament, the hard left Communist Refoundation party.</p>
