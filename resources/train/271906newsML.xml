<headline>FOMC voted 12-0 for steady rates at Nov 13 meeting.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee voted 12 to zero at its Nov. 13 meeting to keep short-term U.S. interest rates steady and maintained its bias toward tighter credit, according to minutes of the meeting released Friday.</p>
<p>The FOMC has since met again Tuesday of this week and again elected to keep interest rates unchanged. Minutes of that meeting, however, will not be made public until early February.</p>
<p>&quot;While the members expressed varying degrees of concern that tight labour markets and attendant increases in wages might at some point lead to rising price inflation, they agreed there was little or no evidence of such a development at this point and the outlook was far from certain,&quot; the minutes said.</p>
<p>This was the fourth consecutive meeting where the FOMC elected to have a directive toward tightening credit. The 5.25-percent federal funds rate and the 5.0-percent discount rate, however, have remained unchanged since Feb. 1.</p>
