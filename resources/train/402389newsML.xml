<p>Britain's transport minister is set to announce plans for the sale of London's Underground rail network for two billion pounds which would be reinvested in the system, according to a report in The Times.</p>
<p>The report said the plan to be unveiled by Transport Minister Sir George Young on Tuesday and implemented if the Conservative are re-elected in this year's general election, would require the proceeds to be ploughed back into rejuventating the commuter network.</p>
<p>Sale of 'The Tube' is being billed by the government as a possible vote winner among London's commuter masses in the election which must be held by May 22.</p>
<p>The two billion price tag mooted by the Times is higher than previous estimates by government insiders. Most recently, Stephen Norris, the former transport minister who is working on the government's election manifesto, told Reuters up to 1.5 billion pounds could be raised from the sale.</p>
<p>Recent press reports said the sale had been delayed by ministers amid public concern that privatisation would not include safeguards on prices and service standards.</p>
<p>Addressing this issue is now seen as key to winning public support by government ministers led by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, said The Times.</p>
<p>Young is interested in selling the network off under a 10 to 20 year franchise, said the report, with the government retaining ultimate strategic control.</p>
<p>The move will follow the completion of the controversial privatisation of Britain's rail network which included the sale of the rail passenger services under a franchising system -- seen as a possible model for the underground sale.</p>
<p>Privatisation of the underground is expected to be one of the key issues in the ruling Conservative Party's election manifesto. The Times said the manifesto will also include proposals to give the still publicly owned Post Office greater commercial freedom.</p>
<p>But plans to privatise the Post Office and the Channel Four television station have been ditched. Even so the government is still looking to raise 6.5 billion stg in sell-offs over the next four years, if it wins the election, said the report.</p>
