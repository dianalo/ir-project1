<title>USA: CBOT soybeans end firmer but off contract highs.</title>
<headline>CBOT soybeans end firmer but off contract highs.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT soybean futures ended firmer on Friday but off earlier contract highs on ideas prices needed to rise further to ration demand, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reduction in usage still is not severe enough,&quot; said Bob Lekberg, analyst with Goldenberg-Hehmeyer. &quot;That's finally what the market is coming around to realizing. The cutback in usage in the last half of the year will have to be at record severity to keep that carry at 125 (million bushels).&quot;</p>
<p>He referred to the U.S. Agriculture Department's estimate in April that marketing year ending soybean stocks would tally 125 million bushels, the lowest level in two decades.</p>
<p>Soybeans ended 8-3/4 to three cents per bushel higher with July up 8-1/2 at $8.55-1/2.</p>
<p>Contract highs were notched in the May and July contracts on ideas soybeans were on the verge of an even greater rally. Traders said Sparks Companies, an influential U.S. analytical firm, had issued a buy recommendation, saying this may be the last time to buy soybeans before the market rallies sharply.</p>
<p>But a Sparks spokesman said the company does not issue buy recommendations and he did not know the origin of the rumor.</p>
<p>Still, the talk bolstered bullish sentiment prompted by Thursday's weekly crush and export figures.  </p>
<p>The National Oilseed Processors Association put weekly soybean crushings at roughly 25 million bushels, above expectations for 24.1 million to 24.9 million.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts have said weekly crush and export usage levels need to fall below 32 million bushels to stay in line with USDA projections. Thursday's USDA weekly export tally was roughly 14 million bushels.</p>
<p>The new high for the July contract is $8.96, topping the previous high of $8.95 set on Thursday and the highest level since the 1988 drought.</p>
<p>Chartists gave the day's action mixed reviews, with some citing bearish signals as old crop months again failed to hold on at contract highs. But others said the July closed above the moving averages and was primed for further gains.</p>
<p>On the day, funds bought at least 15 million bushels, led by Goldenberg-Hehmeyer which bought eight million bushels July and five million August, pit sources said. However, Refco Inc was the largest seller on the day, accounting for at least five million bushels July and 1.5 million May.</p>
<p>In spread trade, Refco Inc spread 1.5 million November/July at $1.81 to $1.82, premium July and USA Trading spread 1.5 million November/July at $1.80 to $1.81.</p>
<p>Soybean volume was estimated by CBOT at 80,000 contracts, compared with Thursday's actual volume of 71,600 contracts.</p>
