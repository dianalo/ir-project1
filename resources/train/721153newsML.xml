<headline>Shanghai B shares edge up at noon in narrow trade.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-07-10</dateline>

<p>Shanghai's foreign currency B shares edged higher on Thursday morning but trading was confined to a narrow range as investors awaited fresh news, brokers said.</p>
<p>Signs are emerging that sentiment is on improving, helped by talk that recent market falls were too sharp given Beijing's aim to promote stability of share prices, they said.</p>
<p>The B index rose 0.648 points or 0.88 percent to 74.374 points on volume of 5.899 million shares worth $3.040 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;Domestic retail investors are still the main buyers in the market,&quot; said a local broker.</p>
<p>&quot;After yesterday's solid gains and today's rise, there are hopes of a recovery in market sentiment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the market is still likely to experience short term fluctuations because of uncertainty about direction,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Shanghai B index rebounded 3.4 percent on Wednesday on bargain hunting after a series of falls since the July 1 return of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule, which had been a major positive factor for the market, brokers said.  </p>
<p>But many investors were still hesitant to return to the market as they awaited fresh news, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term, there is no clear trend so people are just waiting for news,&quot; said an analyst at an Asian securities firm in Shanghai.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall sentiment is not that good, but people expect interim results to be better this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Companies would report results for the first half of 1997 later this month and in August, and strong performances by individual companies were expected to attract selective buying, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Of 45 B shares, 35 traded in the morning session, with 21 up, 10 down and four flat.</p>
<p>Domestic currency A shares also inched higher, helped by talk that the government would slow the pace of new share listings and issues, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index gained 3.210 points or 0.27 percent to 1,174.411 on volume of 120.438 million shares worth 1.408 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index gained 16.319 points or 0.44 percent to 3,730.341 points.</p>
<p>Brokers said the A and B share markets were likely to continue to move around current levels in afternoon trading on Thursday.  </p>
