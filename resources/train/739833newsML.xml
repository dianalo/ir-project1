<title>UK: Weather, EU tender dominate Europe grain trade.</title>
<headline>Weather, EU tender dominate Europe grain trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>European grain traders this week focused on the harvest and the EU's first free market export tender of the marketing year.</p>
<p>Wet weather brought harvesting to a halt in many areas, while there was criticism that the export refund set on wheat left European supplies uncompetitive.</p>
<p>The weather should get better next week. But the trade has to wait until July 31 for another EU tender.</p>
<p>In French markets uncertainty over crop quality thwarted wheat business, dealers said.</p>
<p>Buyers mostly concentrated on securing good quality milling wheat in a year that may yield a large but mediocre crop.</p>
<p>They were prepared to offer premiums of 15-20 francs for best quality wheat but sellers were not ready to offer such guarantees so there was no trade.</p>
<p>On Friday Rouen wheat for August-December delivery was bid at 860 francs per tonne, excluding carry, up five francs on Thursday and underpinned by a lack of sellers.</p>
<p>The return of wet weather in the north revived fears wheat quality might be hit while rain in late June led to unwanted germination in the Poitou-Charentes area.</p>
<p>More rain is forecast for the north and northeast of France over the weekend but dry conditions are set to return early next week.</p>
<p>In its July report French grain analyst Strategie Grains said high moisture levels sparked an outbreak of disease in the north, threatening yield and quality. But only the first cuts will reveal the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>Some brokers said it was premature to worry over soft wheat quality in the north as grain had not yet reached the maturing stage where it is vulnerable to possible germination.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too early to seriously talk of quality problems,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>New crop barley prices eased as farmers turned sellers to make room for the new harvest.</p>
<p>July barley into Rouen was quoted at 800-810 francs per tonne against 820 francs last week.</p>
<p>In the Champagne-Ardennes area in eastern France, where the barley harvest is under way, initial results suggested the crop fared much better than anticipated despite a prolonged drought in the spring.</p>
<p>Old crop maize prices eased slightly under pressure from possible competition from a large feed wheat crop.</p>
<p>Growing conditions in France's southwest are excellent with a combination of heat and moisture.</p>
<p>On Thursday the European Union launched its new grain campaign by granting 100,000 tonnes of wheat exports but brokers said the sale was too modest to move prices.</p>
<p>Some traders said the award was a gesture showing the EU wanted to have a presence in the market at the start of the season, but others said they were disappointed the Commission has not done more in the face of aggressive bidding.</p>
<p>They said the wheat sale helped cover unfinished business with Cuba and Iraq. But the modest volume at $144 showed the EU was not yet ready to compete with the U.S. at a time when soft red winter wheat was at $127.</p>
<p>French exporters are particularly worried about missing sales to drought-hit North Africa, a traditional outlet for their grain.</p>
<p>German traders said Thursday's EU awards were within the range they had expected and were neutral for wheat, but they had expected a larger barley volume to be authorised for export.</p>
<p>Wheat prices held steady in thin trading as the absence of British and French sellers was supportive, offsetting downward pressure from positive domestic harvest expectations.</p>
<p>Barley prices drifted lower under pressure from France, where the harvest is nearly over.</p>
<p>Feed rye prices were also easing because of competition from imported feeds and because reports of fresh outbreaks of swine fever in the Netherlands overshadowed feed grain demand.</p>
<p>Germany's 1997 grain harvest may reach 43 million tonnes after 42.1 million last year, trade house Toepfer said on Friday, pegging the EU harvest at 196-199 million (200 in 1996).</p>
<p>Weather put a stop to the barley harvest in Britain, which had only just started. With strong sterling making life difficult and with buyers melting away, the trade, like the combines, rolled to a halt. &quot;There's nothing going on. It's been like this all week,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Despite the general lack of demand, some barley was sent to Spain to alleviate supply problems caused by wet weather there, traders said.</p>
<p>The strength of sterling helped push prices lower.</p>
<p>Spanish dealers said overall prices were stronger, despite wide differences because of vastly different standards of crop.</p>
<p>They added Spanish harvests are expected to be of a very bad quality this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We had bad quality in the south, the same bad quality in the central region and now weather conditions are also suggesting bad quality from northern regions&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Recent rains in Castilla Leon badly affected grains in the region.</p>
<p>For durum wheat, prices shown below refer to poor quality grain.</p>
<p>Traders said that good durum is almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>For Spanish maize prices for end-August have started to appear at around 23,000 in Sevilla and 23,500 in Extremadura.  </p>
<p>Some benchmark European prices were as follows (French prices exclude carrying charges, but there are no carrying charges in July. Spanish prices are for new crop, except maize.)</p>
