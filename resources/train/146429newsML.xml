<p>Pakistan on Sunday announced a boycott of a regional conference Iran is hosting this week to seek a solution to the Afghan crisis, signalling sharp differences over the move between the two Islamic neighbours.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official APP news agency, said Pakistan would not attend the meeting, due to begin in Tehran on Tuesday, owing to &quot;shortage of time and lack of clarity about the agenda and proposed list of invitees&quot;.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan had received &quot;confirmed information&quot; about the proposed two-day conference only on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakistan had already maintained that only those countries which were directly concerned with the welfare of Afghanistan should attend any conference of neighbouring or regional countries and such a conference should follow rather than precede an intra-Afghan dialogue,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate, but Pakistan's objection to the list of invitees seemed to be directed against the inclusion of its neighbouring arch-foe India among them.</p>
<p>An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by Tehran's state news agency IRNA, said on Friday that Russia, India, Pakistan, China, Saudi Arabia and the Central Asian states would attend the conference.</p>
<p>Also invited are the European Union and the 52-nation Organisation of Islamic Conference, of which both Iran and Pakistan are members.</p>
<p>Pakistan is averse to giving any role to India in the Afghan problem on the grounds that it does not share borders with Afghanistan and had not opposed the Soviet occupation there.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Iran have been working closely together in diplomatic moves over Afghanistan during 17 years of civil war there, but differences appeared between them after the emergence of the Taleban Islamic movement as a new factor in Afghan politics.</p>
<p>Pakistan's objections to the Tehran conference is most open expression of the differences, which both sides have tried to play down in the past.</p>
<p>Iran's media have accused Pakistan of setting up the Sunni Moslem Taleban with backing from the United States and funding from Saudi Arabia to counter the Shi'ite Moslem Iran's influence in the region.</p>
<p>Pakistan denies the charge and says it has no favourites among the Afghan factions, most of whom it helped during their guerrilla war against Soviet occupation in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Islamabad and Tehran also differ over who are Afghanistan's legitimate rulers.</p>
<p>Pakistan says it will deal with whatever government is in power in Kabul after it was captured last month by the Taleban militia, which controls two-thirds of the country.</p>
<p>But Iran on Wednesday blasted the Taleban as &quot;rebels&quot; and reiterated its recognition of the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.</p>
