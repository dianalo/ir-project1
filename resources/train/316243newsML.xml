<p>The recent rise of the dollar against the yen is mostly a normalisation of an excessively strong yen and its negative impact on U.S. exports is not a major one, Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve vice chairman, told Reuters Financial Television in an interview on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing to remember is that the yen was way overvalued. Like 80 yen to a dollar. And most of (the dollar's rise) is just a snap back to normal,&quot; Blinder said.</p>
<p>He added that the dollar's movement against other currencies has not been that dramatic and in trade-weighted average terms, its movement has been farily modest.  </p>
<p>&quot;So it is a small negative for U.S. export performance but not a major one.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blinder, now a professor at Princeton University, also said the United States is very loath to get involved actively in exchange rate management.</p>
<p>&quot;It does so occasionally, and who knows when they will again, as it is in the hands of the Treasury (Department), but it's something the U.S. does not like to do a lot.&quot; -- Tokyo Policy Desk +81-3-5473-3710</p>
