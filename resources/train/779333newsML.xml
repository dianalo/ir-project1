<p>With just a few weeks to go before the Norwegian elections, an opinion poll on Tuesday showed the ruling Labour minority government had lost over a third of its support since it came to power.</p>
<p>The survey, carried out by one of six major pollsters in the country, Norsk Gallup, and shown on TV2 television, gave Labour 27.5 percent, down 9.4 percent from their result in the 1993 election.</p>
<p>The parliament's three-party centrist bloc received a total of 24.2 percent, down from just below 28 percent four years ago, TV2 said.</p>
<p>Some 950 voters were polled between July 28 and August 1, but as many as 38.5 percent of the sample said they were undecided about how they would vote in the elections due September 15.</p>
<p>The main election threat to Prime Minister Thorbjoern Jagland's government is seen to come from the centrist parties -- the Christian People's Party, the Centre Party and liberal Venstre -- who want to form a minority coalition government.</p>
<p>They want more of Norway's oil wealth to be invested in schools and public transport. The Labour government is setting aside the entire budget surplus, projected at 57.3 billion crowns ($7.5 billion) this year, for the State Petroleum Fund for investment in overseas securities.</p>
<p>Jagland declined immediate comment on the poll.</p>
<p>On Monday, he said his government would step down if it received less votes than in the 1993 election and key opposition parties increased their share.</p>
<p>The poll, the first to be published after the July holidays, showed a surprising boost in votes for the right-wing anti-immigrant Progress Party to 22 percent from 15.7 percent. That would make it the second biggest party in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;I take the figures with a pinch of salt,&quot; Progress Party leader Carl Hagen told TV2. &quot;I believe this poll is a bit unrealistic.&quot;</p>
<p>The Conservatives greeted the poll's results, showing them slipping 3.5 percent to 13.5 percent, with disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe this poll,&quot; Conservative leader Jan Petersen said. &quot;This will not be the outcome of the election.&quot;</p>
<p>The Labour Party, which is the biggest of the eight parties in the 165-seat Storting, or parliament, has been in power since 1990.</p>
