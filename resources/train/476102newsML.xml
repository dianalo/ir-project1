<headline>Scotia leads share loss of banks on Toronto.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-03-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Bank of Nova Scotia led the way as shares of Canada's six major banks drifted lower on the Toronto Stock Exchange after midday under pressure from higher U.S. interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>They said bank shares have fallen as a result of the first rise in U.S. rates in two years by the U.S. Federal Reserve last Tuesday and speculation that the Fed could hike rates further to pre-empt any rise in inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously the market is saying rates are going to go up a whole bunch ,&quot; said Hugh Brown, analyst at Nesbitt Burns. &quot;The market is very volatile and bank stocks have moved up a lot over the last year...so it's just maybe a more than normal sort of correction in a group that's done very well.&quot;</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates 25 basis points last week, bumping up its target for the Federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts have said the Federal Reserve normally raises rates in stages, leading many to predict further increases as the Fed moves to combat the rise of inflation in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Bank of Nova Scotia shares were down 1.90 at 50.50 a share, outstripping Royal Bank shares, which fell 1.50 to 53.75 a share and well ahead of losses at the Bank of Montreal, whose stock was down 1.20 at 49.00 a share.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Bank of Montreal denied that its wholly owned brokerage firm Nesbitt Burns had been especially hurt by exposure to the Bre-X Minerals Ltd debacle, but its shares were down nonetheless.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a combination of rising interest rates and, in the case of Bank of Montreal, also associated with Bre-X,&quot; said, Ira Katzin, investment adviser RBC Dominion Securities.</p>
<p>Other Canadian bank shares were also down in conjunction with Toronto's TSE 300 index which was down 123.23 points or more than two percent to 5808.52 at midday on turnover of 39.04 million shares worth C$619.05 million.</p>
