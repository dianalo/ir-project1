<p>Polish shares rose for the third day running but analysts saw the market losing steam on Thursday as the current technical rebound ends.</p>
<p>The bourse, now at 15,510 points, had fallen about 1,000 points during the last three weeks of July on macroeconomic concerns deepened by flooding, which led to Monday's two-point rise of the lombard rate and 2.5-point rise of the discount.</p>
<p>&quot;It was possible to expect that the NBP would raise rates but whether the scale was expected is another question...and I don't think it has already been completely priced in,&quot; said Andrzej Soldek, an analyst at ING BSK Asset Management.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index rose 1.6 percent to 15,510.0 points and turnover rose 22.2 percent to 183.1 million zlotys ($52.2 million) on both markets. Gainers led losers by 83 to 13 with 12 stocks stable.</p>
<p>Analysts also said buying should be dampened in the run-up to the September 21 parliamentary eletions.</p>
<p>But they said Tuesday's threat by the co-ruling Peasant Party (PSL) that it would seek to oust the ex-communist premier unless farming policy demands were met represented largely an attempt to boost its popularity before the polls.</p>
<p>Industrial boilermaker Rafako fell 13.8 percent on Wednesday, resuming trade after a suspension since July 11 due to flooding.</p>
<p>The firm, which traded without the daily 10-percent price-fluctuation limit on Wednesday, gave an 18.9-million- zloty ($5.4 million) preliminary flood damage estimate but said this year's sales forecast of 370 million zlotys ($105.6 million) had not been changed.</p>
