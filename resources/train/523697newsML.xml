<p>Japan's financial system could implode if the yen weakens sharply, dragging Tokyo stock prices down with it, economist Fred Bergsten said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the yen were to fall further sharply, it could really have a further devastating effect on the financial system,&quot; Bergsten, who heads the Institute for International Economics, said. &quot;The financial system as a whole could implode.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters ahead of Sunday's Group of Seven meeting, Bergsten warned that the dollar was likely to rise substantially if the G7 fail to do anything more to arrest it.  </p>
<p>Japanese banks depend heavily on unrealized gains on their big equity holdings to ensure that they are sufficiently capitalized. If those gains were wiped out by a big fall in the stock market, that would hurt the banks.</p>
<p>Bergsten said the weak yen also means trouble on the international front because it will lead to bigger Japanese current account surplus. If the dollar stays above 120 yen, the surplus will jump to record levels in a year or two, he said.</p>
<p>He urged the G7 -- or at least the United States and Japan -- to intervene in the currency market to bring the dollar down against the yen.  </p>
<p>Bergsten said the near-term target for the dollar/yen exchange rate should be 110 yen to the dollar. The long-run equilibrium level is 100 yen to the dollar, he added.</p>
<p>The economist argued that the intervention would be more effective if it were backed up by changes in Japanese economic policy. In particular, he called on Japan to ease its fiscal policy, tackle its financial system woes through the use of public money and press ahead with wide-ranging deregulation.</p>
<p>But even in the absence of such steps, Bergsten argued that a clear message from the G7 that it wants a stronger yen, backed up by intervention, could have a big market impact.</p>
