<p>The biggest clandestine drug laboratory ever discovered in Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine and a top supplier of heroin, was dismantled on Thursday, authorities said.</p>
<p>National Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said 8.5 tonnes of cocaine and vast quantities of chemicals were seized in a raid on the facility, in a remote settlement in southeastern Guaviare province.</p>
<p>The 1.5 square mile (4 sq km) complex was capable of producing up to 50 tonnes of cocaine a month and was operated by what Serrano described as the fledgling &quot;Eastern Plains&quot; drug cartel.</p>
<p>Little is known about the cartel alleged to be led by a woman.  But Serrano said leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels provided protection for the sprawling complex, which was equipped with its own airstrip and housing for scores of workers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's bigger even than Tranquilandia,&quot; Serrano told Reuters, referring to a huge facility operated by the now defunct Medellin cartel that grabbed world headlines in 1984.</p>
<p>&quot;Oceans of cocaine were coming out of this place to supply international markets,&quot; Serrano said.</p>
<p>He said about 100 crack anti-narcotics police participated in the raid on the drug complex early Wednesday. They finished dismantling it on Thursday.</p>
<p>No arrests were made and police denied initial reports that helicopters, speedboats and one airplane had been seized.</p>
<p>The latest strike against criminal drug syndicates comes amid growing speculation that Colombia will be &quot;descertified&quot; by Washington in March for its alleged failure to participate actively enough in the global fight against drugs.</p>
<p>Decertification, for a second consecutive year, could trigger punitive U.S. economic sanctions against the country that President Bill Clinton fell short of imposing last year.</p>
<p>Serrano was among the most vocal critics of the U.S. decision to decertify Colombia last year, saying no other country has made more sacrifices to stem the flow of illegal drugs onto U.S. streets.</p>
