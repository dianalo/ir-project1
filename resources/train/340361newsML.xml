<p>The Czech government rejected demands from striking teachers on Wednesday, refusing to increase spending from this year's state budget to raise wages in the sector, Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux said.</p>
<p>The Union of School Employees, an umbrella group of teachers and other personnel from elementary and secondary schools, began a chain strike on Tuesday in selected districts, rotating to other schools throughout the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The government agreed that in 1997 there is no room for increase in the education section of the state budget,&quot; Lux told the news conference after a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The union is demanding an 18.9 percent wage increase to come from increased government spending, but Education Minister Ivan Pilip has only offered several cost-cutting measures within the system to provide money for wage hikes.</p>
<p>The measures offered by the ministry include increasing the number of hours worked by some teachers, while making others redundant, and closing some schools where the number of pupils is waning.</p>
<p>The union have yet to give a formal response to the government decision, nor to the ministry's proposals, saying they have not yet received them.</p>
<p>Education Ministry spokesman Michal Jirkovsky said that in the first three quarters of 1996, the average wage of school employees was 8,770 Czech crowns ($314), while teachers were getting an average of 10,380 crowns.</p>
<p>The average Czech wage was 9,210 crowns during that period, and 8,840 crowns in the state sector, according to data released by the Czech Statistical Bureau. ($1=27.92 Czech Crown)</p>
