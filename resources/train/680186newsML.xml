<p>Squeeze, backhanders and private enforcers may be a way of life for business in China but for Hong Kong they could be the way of the future.</p>
<p>As Hong Kong prepares for its return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, opinion surveys show the erosion of the rule of law is one of the top worries for the British colony's residents.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong will probably look a bit more like China does today,&quot; said a Western diplomat in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;But the key is in Hong Kong's court system,&quot; he said. &quot;We will want to see whether the courts remain independent.&quot;</p>
<p>Chinese and Western businessmen on this side of the border routinely complain of the need for &quot;grease&quot; to turn the heavy machinery of China's officialdom.</p>
<p>Permits, licences or just a space for someone's goods on a shop shelf are all fair game for a little bit of graft or the need to &quot;take care of one's friends&quot;.</p>
<p>REMARKS ABOUT HONG KONG CRIMINALS CAUSED CONCERN</p>
<p>China did little to help its reputation or build confidence in Hong Kong with the now infamous remarks by top cop Tao Siju who once said the territory's organised criminals could be tolerated as long as they were patriotic.</p>
<p>Even China's state-run television has been alarmed at the problem of official toleration -- if not outright participation -- in illicit business. It recently broadcast a programme devoted to unmasking policemen who doubled as enforcers for brothels, discos and gambling dens.</p>
<p>In a more recent display of the sometimes fine distinction between law breakers and law enforcers, protesters staged a sit-in protest outside the seat of the Communist Party headquarters in Beijing on Friday, alleging they had been swindled by none other than the State Security Ministry -- the government arm in charge of maintaining internal stability.</p>
<p>Protesters said a real estate company belonging to the ministry which had redeveloped their property, reneged on its pledge to give them new apartments, leaving them homeless.</p>
<p>CHINA GETS LOW MARKS OVER CORRUPTION</p>
<p>&quot;China has consistently scored poorly in our surveys of expatriates in the region for corruption problems,&quot; said Bob Broadfoot of Political and Economic Risk Consultancy in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;The worrisome point for the future is cross-border corruption,&quot; he said. &quot;There will be new opportunities as more Chinese are allowed to come to Hong Kong.&quot;</p>
<p>China has made strides in strengthening its legal system but many of its commercial rules remain unpublished while statutes on the books are not always enforced.</p>
<p>These are already among the top concerns of U.S. companies in China, says the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;It goes beyond the publishing of rules,&quot; said John Holden, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. &quot;It is also an issue of enforcement. We won't have the legal protection we need (in China) until we have better enforcement.&quot;</p>
<p>HONG KONG BOASTS STRONG INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>Hong Kong, however, has the legal system of more than 150 years of British colonial rule to hold the line on a seepage of corruption from the mainland.</p>
<p>It also has the powerful crime-busting agency, the Independent Commission Against Corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be interesting to see what happens when the first 'princeling' runs afoul of the law,&quot; said a diplomat in a reference to the privileged offspring of Beijing's high officials who have sometimes proved able to flout Chinese law with impunity.</p>
<p>Among the most well-known princelings, albeit one who keeps a low profile, is Deng Zhifang, son of late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who quietly quit as a vice-chairman of a listed Hong Kong subsidiary of giant Capital Iron and Steel.</p>
<p>The chairman of the subsidiary -- another princeling -- was jailed for life for corruption.</p>
<p>Analysts in Beijing said one fear is that Chinese organisations may try to muscle their way into lucrative businesses in Hong Kong under the threat of blocking deals on the mainland.</p>
<p>But others maintain that China will learn to adapt to the Hong Kong system, rather than disrupt it.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason why they (Chinese companies) can't learn to do things the Hong Kong way,&quot; said Huang Hai, an attorney who specialises in commercial law at Guo Da Law Office in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are already getting closer to international standards in commercial laws in China,&quot; he said. &quot;The problems we have with the legal system now tend to be in sensitive areas that deal with political stability.&quot;</p>
<p>Other businessmen point out that Chinese companies that have listed their shares on Hong Kong's stock market have learned to comply -- though with some exceptions -- with Hong Kong's regulations.</p>
<p>Businessmen said even after a modest deterioration of Hong Kong's business environment the territory would still look attractive compared with the rest of China.</p>
<p>Hong Kong would still have the best legal environment in China, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is the fear that corruption in Hong Kong could get worse in the future,&quot; said Broadfoot.</p>
<p>&quot;But judging from the facts of the present, Hong Kong's position as a regional business centre does not appear to be in jeopardy.&quot;</p>
