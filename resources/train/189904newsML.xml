<title>UK: Czarnikow sees higher world 1996/97 sugar output.</title>
<headline>Czarnikow sees higher world 1996/97 sugar output.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-14</dateline>

<p>World sugar output is expected to total 124.33 million tonnes raw value in the 1996/97 crop year, up from the 123.19 million produced in the previous year, Czarnikow Sugar said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In its second estimate of the world balance, Czarnikow said consumption in the 1997 calendar year was expected to reach 120.57 million tonnes, 2.24 million tonnes up on this year.</p>
<p>Czarnikow said it had raised its 1996/97 disappearance factor from 100,000 to 750,000 tonnes to take account of unrecorded sugar movements and consumption.</p>
<p>This indicated that world sugar stocks would increase by some 3.0 million tonnes after a rise of 4.21 million tonnes in 1995/96, it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Not all of the difference between the two (production and consumption) will carry through to a stock adjustment,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It did not give an expected level for 1996/97 stocks.</p>
<p>The cane sector was expected to account for 88.38 million tonnes of the global production total, up from 86.81 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>In its first estimate of the world sugar balance released in August, Czarnikow pegged 1996/97 production at just under 122 million tonnes with 1997 consumption expected at 120 million.</p>
<p>Of the overall output gain of 2.33 million tonnes since the previous estimate, no less than 1.3 million tonnes could be attributed to India, it said, adding that local industry sources were suggesting that even higher gains were possible.</p>
<p>While India was expected to produce less sugar than the record 17.94 million tonnes in 1995/96, Czarnikow raised its forecast for 1996/97 by 1.3 million tonnes to 16.3 million.</p>
<p>Raw sugar demand would be dominated by China next year, where consumption in the 1997 calendar year was estimated at 8.6 million tonnes, 1.0 million up on this year.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be the prospect of slightly higher production as the cane season develops but the outlook remains that once domestic production has been absorbed, it is quite likely that the authorities will wish to avoid depleting reserves once again and return to the world market for supplementary supplies.&quot;</p>
<p>Record sugar production was expected in both growing regions of key Latin American producer Brazil, where output was pegged 14.85 million tonnes compared with 13.59 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Czarnikow said it was making only a modest increase in its estimate for 1996/97 Cuban sugar output as damage from Hurricane Lili made it less likely that the official target of 5.2 million tonnes would be met.</p>
<p>It pegged Cuba's output at 4.65 million tonnes after 4.53 million in 1995/96.</p>
