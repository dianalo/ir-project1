<p>Domestic car and light truck sales fell 5.8 percent in May, marking the second consecutive month of softer demand, as Ford Motor Co. Wednesday reported a 3 percent sales decline for the month.</p>
<p>The Ford results -- comparatively better than those of Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. -- mirrored the industry trend of relatively strong truck sales offset by chronic weakness in passenger car sales.</p>
<p>&quot;May is a clear signal that we're reaching a saturation point in demand,&quot; said John Casesa, an auto analyst with Schroder Wertheim &amp; Co. &quot;Incentives continue to go up, and sales are not going up.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall, industry sales fell 5.8 percent to 1.4 million units in May, which was good enough for a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of about 14.8 million units, significantly below the 15.4-million rate a year earlier and the robust first-quarter rate of 15.6 million vehicles.</p>
<p>Despite the booming economy, strong consumer confidence, and low unemployment and inflation, there are fewer and fewer consumers who have not already bought a new car or truck in recent years.</p>
<p>Lower used car prices -- a result of leases that have put more high-quality used cars and trucks on dealer lots -- have drawn buyers away from new cars. In addition, second-quarter sales are suffering somewhat because heavy promotions pulled some sales into the first quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that June will see a snap-back in demand,&quot; said George Magliano of the WEFA Group in New York. &quot;We'll be alright in the next quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>He estimated that sales for 1997 will be about 14.9 million cars and light trucks, down from 15.1 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Ford said its North American-built car sales fell 11.8 percent to 150,185 units while light-truck sales, fuelled by strong demand for sport utility vehicles, rose 5.2 percent to a company record of 206,087 units.</p>
<p>Ford's sales declines were below the 16.6 percent overall May sales drop reported by Chrysler and the 8.1 percent drop reported by GM this week.</p>
<p>Ford continued to be bullish about light truck demand, and confirmed plans to add 15,000 trucks, mainly Windstar minivans, to its second-quarter production schedule. As a result, Ford intends to build 772,000 trucks in the quarter, up 13 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Ford also said it added 5,000 cars to its second-quarter schedules, which would put output at 466,000 cars, a 14 percent decline from a year ago.</p>
<p>GM's sales, hurt by two assembly plant strikes, included a 5.4 percent increase in truck sales -- also to a company record -- and a 16.7 percent drop in car sales. Chrysler's car sales fell 17.9 percent, while truck sales, hurt by an engine plant strike, fell 15.5 percent.</p>
<p>Ford's truck record was fuelled largely by a 47 percent increase in sales of sport utility vehicles to 58,879 units. Much of the credit was due to the full-size Expedition, which analysts estimate hauls in $10,000 in profits per unit.</p>
<p>Ford also plans July 1 to introduce the new, even more luxurious Lincoln Navigator luxury sport utility vehicle, which is based on the Expedition. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it has dealer orders for about 11,000 Navigators.</p>
