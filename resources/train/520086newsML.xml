<p>Nigeria's Kaduna oil refinery, the only such facility in the northern part of the country, will undergo a mandatory turn around maintenance in July, said the managing director of the plant, Morrison Tamuno.</p>
<p>State-owned News Agency of Nigeria said he told the staff of the refinery Thursday that oil minister Dan Etete approved the maintenance work, which should been undertaken since 1991.</p>
<p>Discussions were already on between Kaduna refinery and contractors to handle the job, and approval was given to provide the refinery with two additional boilers.</p>
<p>Tamuno said rehabilitation work on the lube section of the plant which was destroyed by a fire in 1994 had also been awarded to contractors.</p>
<p>The 110,000-barrel-per-day refinery is, like Nigeria's other three refineries, producing below capacity because of poor management and reduced allocation of crude oil to them.</p>
<p>The poor performance of the refineries is partly responsible for a fuel shortage that plagued Nigeria recently, lasting for more than three weeks.</p>
