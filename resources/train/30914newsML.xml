<p>Iraqi opposition and Kurdish groups welcomed U.S. attacks on targets in Iraq on Tuesday, but expressed concern about the possibility of civilian casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome any action to reverse (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's invasion of northern Iraq,&quot; a spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress (INC) told Reuters. &quot;But we are concerned about civilian casualties. Saddam often puts military facilities in residential areas.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokesman said he hoped that the military action be followed by concrete steps, &quot;like extending the no-fly zone or imposing a no armour and heavy weapons zone in northern Iraq&quot;.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the United States said it had launched cruise missile attacks against Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi attacks on the Kurdish north.</p>
<p>The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) faction said it hoped this attack would pave the way for Saddam's downfall.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope it will force Saddam Hussein to withdraw all his attacking forces from Arbil from all the places which they have entered,&quot; the PUK's Latif Rashid told Reuters from London.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a first step to undermine Saddam Hussein's regime. We hope this will lead to the fall of Saddam Hussein,&quot; he said. &quot;We want the United States and international community to help us get rid of this brutal dictator.&quot;</p>
<p>Iraqi forces attacked the northern Iraqi town of Arbil at the weekend, ousting the PUK faction in place there and replacing it with a rival group more favourable to Baghdad.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said Iraqi forces had withdrawn from Arbil but the United States said this was insignificant as tanks were still outside the town.</p>
