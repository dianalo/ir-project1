<text>
<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets near midday were inactive, with no reported sales following active trading late Thursday, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Sales Thursday were mostly after 1500 CST at $66.00, steady with last week although USDA reported a few pens of steers and heifers sold at $66.25.</p>
<p>A few packer bids Friday at $65.00 per cwt were passed by owners who were generally asking $67.00, cattle feeders said.</p>
<p>Weekly sales in Kansas were pegged Thursday by USDA at 83,900 head, including 24,200 or about 29 percent previously contracted or formulated cattle.  </p>
<p>Week-to-date sales in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area through Thursday at 62,400 head, including 17,100 formulated cattle, USDA said.</p>
<p>Most of this week's showlist in Kansas was sold while a few Panhandle-area feedyards were carrying supplies over into next week. However, most feedlots remained current in their marketings, sources said.</p>
<p>The currentness was expected to keep asking levels at $67.00 to $68.00 next week, several cattle feeders said. However, slipping beef prices could stymie bullish enthusiasm, they said.</p>
