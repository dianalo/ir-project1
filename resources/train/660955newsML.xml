<p>Adelaide stockbroker Day Cutten Ltd said on Friday that prospects for the Australian wine industry continued to be exceptional, with the next three years appearing to offer good sustained growth for a number of companies.</p>
<p>In its annual Wine Companies Review, the broker said that over the past year the average market valuation of wine companies had grown to parity with the market average benchmark for the industrial sector excluding banks.  </p>
<p>&quot;Recognising the usually high growth potential of these businesses in the current environment, balanced against the risks, we believe that average is a fair valuation measure for the wine sector,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The broker said it would be cautious about applying any premium for wine companies, given the 17 percent rise in the All Industrials index since June 1996.</p>
<p>Underlying industry risks were grape price escalation, adverse currency movement and potential crop failures, it said.  </p>
<p>The move to higher value products for exports should be reflected in improving margins, boosted further when the more plentiful 1996 vintage stock which reduced costs come on stream.</p>
<p>Day Cutten said that while Simeon Wines Ltd had launched a bid for Australian Vintage Ltd, any further rationalisation appeared likely only outside listed companies.</p>
<p>The four biggest producers -- Southcorp Holdings Ltd, BRL Hardy Ltd, the Pernod Ricard owned Orlando Wyndham, and Foster's Brewing Group Ltd's Mildara Blass -- could be expected to acquire small private wine producers with complementary brands and grape sources, it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;However we believe that generally the major wine houses are now looking more to consolidate their export businesses with acquisitions of and alliances with overseas operations,&quot; said.</p>
<p>Assessing the stocks, Day Cutten issued short-term hold, long-term accumulate recommendations for BRL Hardy, forecasting net profit before abnormals to rise to A$25 million in calendar 1997 and A$28.2 million in 1998 from A$21.2 million in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;While we believe BRL should command a five percent premium to its smaller peers, the stock is fair value (A$3.57 at the time of writing) given the current environment of strong positive sentiment for the wine industry,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>The stock was trading at A$3.89 on Friday, down one cent.</p>
<p>It recommended short-term hold and long-term accumulate for Australian Vintage (A$3.19) and short and long-term hold for Simeon (A$3.50) pending details of the offer, saying a merger appeared attractive and could prompt a rerating of Simeon.</p>
<p>Australian Vintage was trading at A$3.10 on Friday, down two, while Simeon last traded at A$3.43 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Day Cutten recommended selling Brian McGuigan Wines Ltd in the short-term and to hold long-term, saying it was strategically positioned for substantial potential growth in the medium to longer term.  </p>
<p>But the share price (A$1.46) was 43 percent overvalued on a two year earnings view, it said.</p>
<p>The stock was at A$1.35 on Friday, unchanged from Thursday.</p>
<p>The broker said investors should sell Normans Wines Ltd which at the time of writing was trading at A$0.82 and at a 30 percent premium to the estimated net tangible assets. The stock last traded at 85 cents on Thursday.</p>
<p>The report recommended a hold on Petaluma Ltd which was near fair value at A$8.52 (A$8.68 on Friday, unchanged).  </p>
<p>Day Cutten said Peter Lehmann Wines Ltd had had a strong run in price over the last year to A$1.65, its trading price on Friday, and was trading on a prospective 1997/98 price earnings ratio of 17.8 times.</p>
<p>It said Lehmann's medium to long term growth potential was attractive and a significant stake may be difficult to replace due to the small traded volumes, so investors should consider lightening holdings above A$1.60 but hold for long-term growth.  </p>
<p>Day Cutten rated Australian Wine and Horticultural Fund a short and long term buy, saying the price at time of writing (A$1.55), a 19 percent discount to net tangible assets, was good value.</p>
<p>The stock was unchanged at A$1.56 on Friday.</p>
