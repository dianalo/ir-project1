<p>At least 15 people were killed and scores more injured on Tuesday when a string of tornadoes and powerful storms ripped through central Texas, police said.</p>
<p>Richard Elliot, the chief deputy sheriff for Williamson County, said at least 14 people were killed by one tornado in and around the small town of Jarrell.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've got 14 confirmed dead,&quot; Elliot told reporters at a rural community of mobile homes which was obliterated by the tornado. &quot;We've got nothing left except piles of debris.&quot;</p>
<p>Rescue workers tried to find victims and survivors in the rubble of between 50 and 75 homes and trailer homes flattened when the tornado roared through about 3:45 p.m. (4:45 EDT) (2045 GMT).</p>
<p>Dozens of cars and trucks were torn into bits, their twisted parts lying in ditches, on open ground or entangled in the wreckage of nearby homes.</p>
<p>Several tornadoes were reported between the cities of Waco and Austin during the afternoon and officials said one person drowned in flash flooding in Austin.</p>
