<p>The strength of sterling  took its toll on Associated British Foods Plc as it knocked off some 11 million pounds ($17.9 million) ($18 million) from its half-year profits reported on Monday.</p>
<p>ABF reported pre-tax profits of 201 million pounds for 24 weeks to March 1, 1997 on Monday, just three million ahead of its previous year's figures. Operating profits stood at at 181 million pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;This reduction results from the lower selling prices and margins following the realignment of the green pound (the European Union currency adjustment used in agri-trade),&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>The group's turnover inched ahead by two percent to 2.66 billion pounds after adjusting for 70 million pounds for appreciation of the pound.</p>
<p>The company maintained its interim dividend at 4.25 pence a share.</p>
<p>The company said its results would continue to be affected by the strength of the sterling but it anticipated a satisfactory trading performance from its operating companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Results will continue to be affected by the strength of sterling...but nevertheless, we anticipate a satisfactory trading performance from our operating companies,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>ABF took a six million pound beating on the profits of its British Sugar operations which fell three million to 84 million pounds on a turnover of 389 million.</p>
<p>Sterling also shaved off its commodity trading results after it drove down grain and oilseed prices, the company said.</p>
<p>Overall, the company's manufacturing units reported profits of 147 million pounds on turnover of 1.95 billion. The rise in sterling knocked 10 million pounds from these profits and 48 million from turnover.</p>
<p>ABF'S retail companies reported profits unchanged at 34 million pounds on sales of 713 million, five million pounds more than last year. Earlier this month, ABF announced the sale of most of its Irish food retailing businesses to Tesco Plc. ($ = 0.614 British Pounds)</p>
