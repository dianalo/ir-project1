<p>A federal judge in Miami sentenced a Palestinian man to 20 years in jail on Monday for hijacking a Havana-bound Iberia airlines plane using a makeshift knife and fake bomb.</p>
<p>Saad'o Mohamed Ibrahim Intissar, 28, said during his trial that he diverted the plane to Miami because he wanted to avoid going to Cuba for military training for an Islamic group.</p>
<p>The 20-year jail term handed down by U.S. Judge Lenore Nesbitt was the minimum mandatory sentence under federal law. A jury convicted Intissar of aircraft piracy in April after a week-long trial.</p>
<p>Iberia airlines Flight 6621 was bound from Madrid to Havana on July 26 last year when Intissar forced his way into the cockpit by holding a makeshift knife against a flight attendant, the court heard during the trial.</p>
<p>For the duration of the flight he sat in the cockpit holding two wires attached to what appeared to be a bomb, threatening to blow up the plane unless his demands were met.</p>
<p>He was arrested on landing in Miami and has been detained since then.</p>
<p>During the trial he admitted hijacking the plane but said he did so under duress.</p>
<p>His attorney, Joaquin Mendez, argued that Intissar feared what might await him in Cuba. He was sent there for military training by an organisation called the Islamic Revolutionary Army, which Mendez said was linked to the pro-Iranian Hizbollah group fighting to oust Israeli troops from south Lebanon.</p>
<p>Intissar, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in south Lebanon, had tried to avoid the journey before boarding the plane. He had hurt no one and agreed to surrender on arrival in the United States, where he was hoping to gain political asylum, Mendez said.</p>
<p>Cuba has denied Intissar was to have received training there.</p>
