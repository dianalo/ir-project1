<headline>U.S. non-committal on Lebed dismissal.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-10-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United States on Thursday took no official position on the dismissal of Russian security chief Alexander Lebed, calling it an internal Russian matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. has no comment. It is an internal affair of the Russian government and the Russian people,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said in a statement to reporters.</p>
<p>A senior White House official said Russian President Boris Yeltsin had &quot;acted in accordance with his constitutional perogatives&quot; in firing Lebed.</p>
<p>Asked if the United States had advance notice of the move, the official, who asked not to be identified, said: &quot;I am not aware of any.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States has had mixed feelings about Lebed, a reserve general who scored a strong 15 per cent in the first round of Russia's presidential election last June.</p>
<p>Washington welcomed Lebed's success in negotiating an end to fighting in Chechnya, and also praised comments he made during a visit to Brussels this month which appeared to take a flexible view of NATO expansion.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials have also seen him as something of a loose cannon and have condemned comments he made which they said were hostile to religious groups including Jews and Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>In Moscow, U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said the sacking of Lebed would not change the deepening security relationship between Washington and Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;The relationship between Mr. Lebed and U.S. officials never really had a chance to develop, and so I don't see any fundamental change in the U.S.-Russian relationship in terms of this announcement,&quot; Perry told reporters in response to questions after Yeltsin publicly sacked his security chief.</p>
<p>Perry, on a three-day visit to Russia, said he had cancelled a meeting with Lebed at the last minute late on Thursday because he was aware &quot;of the problems that Lebed was having with the government.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could not forecast this particular outcome, but it seemed unwise to go ahead and schedule that meeting and so we did not schedule it,&quot; Perry said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our security relationship will proceed just as it has been proceeding,&quot; he added.</p>
