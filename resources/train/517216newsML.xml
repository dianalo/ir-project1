<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian Commodities Roundup - April 18.</title>
<headline>Australian Commodities Roundup - April 18.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Base metal prices meandered within narrow ranges overnight in thin and uninspired trading but gold firmed, led by a jump in platinum group metals.</p>
<p>Wheat prices also rebounded strongly as the European Commission closed its weekly export tender for 1996/97 soft wheat while stronger gasoline demand helped push up oil prices.</p>
<p>The CRB index closed 2.07 points higher at 245.31.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Three months copper was arguably the biggest mover of the day, clambering up nearly to the $2,280 per tonne level early in the day. But the market was reluctant to stay at the highs and prices finished the afternoon kerb at $2,260, just $4 up from Wednesday's close. Copper had similarly failed an upside stab on Wednesday, when it slid lower after touching $2,293.</p>
<p>&quot;Things petered out in the afternoon, the same as yesterday. But copper may be getting a bit oversold so if the market is getting a bit short prices could pick up tomorrow ahead of the weekend,&quot; a trader said. Spreads were largely ignored and cash to threes backwardation was just narrower at $32/$33.</p>
<p>Chartwise, copper looked to be consolidating after last week's sharp fund sell-off, and traders said they did not expect prices to move significantly in the near term.</p>
<p>The other metals showed even less spark and mostly finished little changed after trading in tiny bands. Aluminium was barely firmer at $1,550, up $3 from Wednesday's kerb close.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the metals may need to drift down another $10-$15 before they can try the upside again,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Lead and zinc were very quiet most of the day, but during the kerb some aggressive selling pushed them lower before a subsequent bounce. Zinc ended $2 higher at $1,243, while lead was $5 lower at $634. The market took note of news that Gold Fields Namibia's Tsumeb recently commissioned lead smelter would be closed for several weeks due to post-commissioning problems.</p>
<p>Tin was even more sluggish, barely budging most of the day. It finished just $5 lower at $5,685.</p>
<p>Nickel mimicked copper in trying the upside, but also failed above the $7,300 level and settled little changed. It ended the kerb at $7,270, up $15.</p>
<p>GOLD</p>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended mostly higher, led by a jump in platinum group metals prices after news which suggested Russia may be changing its PGM marketing strategy. Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Chubais said Russia needed a new approach to raising revenue by sales of precious metals, equity issues, privatizations and alcohol taxes. Chubais also said officials from Russia's central bank would resume PGM supply contract talks with Japan next week.</p>
<p>Russia is the world's largest supplier of palladium and supplies have been disrupted since December due to Russian fiscal and administrative problems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reports suggested the Russian government was discussing with Swiss bank, UBS, a swap of stockpiled platinum and palladium for 30 tonnes of gold. UBS is said to be holding 30 tonnes of Russian gold as collateral for a loan to the Russian government in 1995. The deal may be worth more than $330 million and is seen possibly delaying further Russian PGM supply contracts with the Japanese.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum ended up $6.60 at $378.40 an ounce after climbing a session peak of $384.50, the contract's highest level for a month.</p>
<p>COMEX June gold ended up $1.00 at $344.30 after trading from $342.10 to $346.20.</p>
<p>&quot;This looks like it could be bullish scenario, with new fund shorts being forced to cover again, as lows for the year in gold may be in, but technically gold would need to climb back above $350 for the outlook to improve,&quot; said Scott Meyers, an analyst with Pioneer Futures, a New York COMEX clearing member.</p>
<p>the four-year low in spot gold of $336.00 set in January have so far held during this week's slump, forcing some funds to buy back positions Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted at $342.30/80 against the London afternoon fix of $340.40 and the New York close Wednesday around $341.00/50.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>NYMEX oil prices seesawed into a positive end Thursday after spot gasoline held technical support amid views of rising gasoline demand. May crude ended seven cents higher a barrel at $19.42 after falling as low as $19.10.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the price action reflects the fact that gasoline inventories are still below a year ago and the demand is picking up,&quot; said John Bradberry, vice president at Transmontaigne Products Services Inc.</p>
<p>May gasoline ended up 0.32 cent at 60.70 cents a gallon. May heating oil ended 0.52 cent up at 54.00 cents a gallon, rebounding from its session low of 53.20.</p>
<p>Dealers noted unseasonably cold weather in several U.S. regions has created a slow start to spring when there is a seasonal uptick in gasoline demand leading up to the summer driving season.</p>
<p>GRAINS</p>
<p>CBOT wheat futures closed strongly higher Thursday as the European Commission closed its weekly export tender for 1996-97 soft wheat, traders said Dry weather in European wheat areas, especially in France, was cited as a key factor in the closure of the weekly export tenders by the European Commission. Wheat closed seven to 18-1/2 cents per bushel higher, with May up 18-1/2 at $4.25-1/4 a bushel. New crop July closed 15-1/2 cents higher at $4.31.</p>
<p>SUGAR</p>
<p>CSCE world sugar futures settled barely higher as trade scale-down buying and light local short-covering blunted earlier losses and lifted the market over unchanged near the close, dealers said. May ended 0.01 cent higher at 10.96 cents per lb, having ranged from 10.98 to 10.86. Most-active July gained 0.03 cent on the day to close at 10.88, while the remaining months finished 0.01 lower to up 0.02.  </p>
