<title>SWEDEN: Weaker European demand hits Electrolux.</title>
<headline>Weaker European demand hits Electrolux.</headline>

<p>Swedish appliance maker Electrolux AB, reporting a 19 percent fall in 1996 profits after financial items, said on Friday it saw lower demand in all business areas on key European markets in 1996.</p>
<p>The biggest fall was in its industrial products division, the company said in its results statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;Most sales for (Commercial Appliances) refer to Europe, where reduced public spending led to a weaker market situation,&quot; Electrolux said.</p>
<p>The European whitegoods market weakened in 1996 compared to the year before, but the market improved in North America, Electrolux said. It reported operating income after depreciation for the Household Appliance division of 2.46 billion crowns compared to 2.58 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Operating income for the group's whitegoods in Europe declined as a result of lower sales and a less favourable product mix,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The result for the unit was counter-balanced by the improvements on the North American market.</p>
<p>&quot;The total U.S. market for whitegoods showed higher volume. Frigidaire Company reported a marked improvement in operating result on the basis of lower production costs and a better product mix,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Operating income for other household appliances was lower than in the previous year, mainly as a result of costs (for) restructuring and start-up of new operations during the fourth quarter, i.e. in floor care products and compressors,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Group sales in the fourth quarter rose to 27.08 billion crowns from 26.98 billion. Operating income after depreciation fell 20 percent to 1.14 billion crowns partly due to a tax audit.</p>
<p>&quot;Operating income for the fourth quarter was charged with an extra provision for taxes in the amount of approximately 60 million crowns for 1993-95, referring to a tax audit in Sweden.&quot;</p>
<p>The fall in operating income in the quarter was mainly due to its Household and Commercial Appliances unit, &quot;both of which were charged with non-recurring costs totalling approximately 150 million crowns during the period,&quot; it said.</p>
