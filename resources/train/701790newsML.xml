<title>MEXICO: No polling booths for Mexico Zapatista rebel area.</title>

<p>Supporters of Mexican Zapatista rebels in the southeastern state of Chiapas face a major hurdle to voting in mid-term elections on July 6 -- no polling booths.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not going to take chances. It's an area where no one goes in,&quot; Jose Woldenberg, head of the Federal Electoral Institute, Mexico's main electoral authority, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said electoral authorities had decided not to install 23 polling stations in the remote mountain and jungle regions in Chiapas that the Zapatista rebels call their own territory, and where they count on support from an estimated 40,000 Mexicans, mostly Indians.</p>
<p>The 23 booths represented only a &quot;reduced percentage&quot; of those set up in Chiapas, Woldenberg said.</p>
<p>The Zapatistas, who rose up against the government in January 1994 demanding greater democracy and Indian rights, have issued no public statement on how they view the elections for the lower house of Congress and a fourth of the Senate.</p>
<p>In the previous federal elections in 1994, they forged an agreement with the government to install polling stations, but Woldenberg said that treaty had not been renewed.</p>
<p>Peace talks between the Zapatistas and President Ernesto Zedillo's government broke down last September after 18 months, but there has been almost no fighting since 1994. The rebels are widely considered isolated and militarily incapacitated by a cordon of government troops.</p>
