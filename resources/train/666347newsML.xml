<p>Romania's Prime Minister left for Washington on Tuesday on a &quot;difficult, if not impossible&quot; mission to persuade the United States to change its mind and back his country's bid for quick NATO membership.</p>
<p>Victor Ciorbea will meet U.S. Vice President Al Gore and leaders of Congress during an eight-day visit seen as a desperate attempt to reverse Washington's verdict that it wanted NATO's initial expansion limited to three new members.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aware it is difficult, if not impossible, that a single visit might determine a change in President Bill Clinton's decision on first-wave NATO expansion,&quot; Ciorbea told reporters at Bucharest's Otopeni airport. &quot;Romania will continue its efforts until the very last moment.&quot;</p>
<p>He was carrying a reply from President Emil Constantinescu to a letter sent by Clinton explaining why Romania was passed over but offering reassurances it would be considered later.</p>
<p>Washington shocked European allies last week by announcing it wanted only the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to be invited to membership talks when the Alliance announces its first eastward expansion at a summit in Madrid on July 8 and 9.</p>
<p>European countries, led by France, Italy and Germany, want Romania and Slovenia to be admitted too and leaders of both countries have vowed to pursue their campaigns to the end.</p>
<p>But some Romanian officials appeared to be redirecting their energies into securing assurances the country would be taken in the next group -- sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>&quot;We need at least a firm date and names for a second group of admissions,&quot; said Deputy Defence Minister Dudu Ionescu, who accompanied Ciorbea to Washington.</p>
<p>Clinton's letter, delivered late on Monday, appeared to try to soothe Romania's disappointment. Public opinion polls show most Romanians favour NATO membership and authorities have led a high-profile crusade whipped up by frenzied media campaigns.</p>
<p>&quot;My decision is not a rejection of Romania's NATO aspirations nor of Romania,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Maintaining an open door to future enlargement is an absolutely essential element of our approach and I am determined to see that this commitment is reflected in the decisions we make in Madrid.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton invited Constantinescu, who ousted an ex-communist in elections last November, to visit Washington.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac also sent a message to Constantinescu, reassuring him that France would maintain its firm support for Romania's bid in the run-up to Madrid.</p>
<p>France and Germany appealed jointly last week for Romania and Slovenia to be considered alongside Washington's choices.</p>
<p>Constantinescu is expected to press Romania's case when he meets East European leaders at a workshop on NATO next week in Prague -- two weeks ahead of the Madrid meeting. He will also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on July 2.</p>
