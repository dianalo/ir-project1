<p>U.S. Midwest direct hog prices early Friday were mostly unchanged to $1.50 per cwt higher, with gains powered by strong packer demand and light hog numbers, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Mnrketings in Iowa and Minnesota were adequate for packer demand, but tight in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, they said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs sold $0.50 higher in the country at $54.50 to $55.00 and steady at plants, with a top of $57.00. Competition for hogs in Illinois was so intense that at least one major packer paid $2.50 premiums over USDA's quoted top Thursday of $55.50, sources there said.  </p>
<p>Illinois hogs sold $0.50 to $1.50 higher at $55.50 to $57.00 in the country and up to $58.00 for plant delivery.</p>
<p>Indiana hogs sold $1.50 higher at $55.00 t0 $55.50 in the country and $56.50 to $57.00 at plants.</p>
<p>&quot;The sun is still shining and people are out farming, which means not many hogs,&quot; an Indiana hog dealer said.</p>
<p>Ohio hogs sold $1.00 higher, with a top of $54.00 in the country and $56.00 at plants.</p>
<p>Strong packer demand was fortified by steep gains in pork prices on Thursday. Pork cut-out values Thursday were quoted up $0.95 to $1.01 per cwt, USDA reported.</p>
