<p>Harold Nicholson, the CIA agent convicted and sentenced to over 23 years in prison for selling secrets to Russia, Thursday said he believed he could work for both sides since the Cold War was over.</p>
<p>Nicholson, in his first interview since his sentencing, said he was &quot;not a natural case of a person who was going to spy against his country,&quot; but was eventually lured into service for Russia by money he felt he needed for his family.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old divorced father of three said he tried to rationalise his behaviour, saying, &quot;I believed I could work both for the CIA and the Russians both at the same time. Russia was no longer the communist government it had been. They were not our number one enemy anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicholson told ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; he viewed terrorism as the main threat facing the United States now, and the Russians were cooperating on that front.</p>
<p>Nicholson, sounding much less contrite than in his sentencing hearing, also tried to downplay the damage his spying caused, saying, &quot;No one was killed. No one was tortured, and the only person that was arrested as a result of my action was me.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicholson, the most senior CIA officer ever convicted of spying, was sentenced on June 5 to 23 years and seven months in prison for accepting payments totalling $300,000 from Russia for a period of 2-1/2 years.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not a natural case of a person who was going to spy against his country. I wasn't disaffected against my country. I had never shown any kind of criminal past, or anything of this nature...There was nothing, other than the fact that I had just found myself in an untenable situation and I didn't know how to get out of it,&quot; he told ABC.</p>
<p>Nicholson earlier this month described his sellout as an effort to compensate his children for the time he spent away from them on undercover missions.</p>
<p>Nicholson is serving his time in a maximum security prison on the West Coast.</p>
<p>The 16-year CIA veteran was arrested at Dulles International AIrport outside Washington on Nov. 16, carrying film and a computer disk of classified information to pass on to Russian agents in Switzerland.</p>
