<title>USA: CSCE nearby coffee down sharply in a correction.</title>
<headline>CSCE nearby coffee down sharply in a correction.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee futures were mainly lower in relatively stable dealings ahead of midday after a dizzying morning which saw benchmark July peak at a new life-of-contract high then plummet over 11.00 cents per lb in the first half hour of trading.</p>
<p>The downturn was viewed as a technical correction to the market's recent stunning rally, traders said, helped by the near completion of roaster price-fixing against May and the return of origin activity after the May Day holiday on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a correction,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;But it is also down because roaster are finishing fixation against May and origin are coming back and selling after the holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>At 1131 EST, July coffee slumped 8.15 cents a lb, to 214.75 cents, after ranging widely from a new lifetime high of 225.00 to 211.50. Spot May was down 5.75 cents, to 247.00, while the back months traded 6.40 lower to 3.60 higher.</p>
<p>The market headed into positive territory from the outset, defying pre-opening expectations, as speculators followed through on Thursday's sharply higher close after a further drawdown in exchange stockpiles.</p>
<p>After Thursday's close, the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks fell by 4,000 bags, to 43,668 bags as of April 30. There were 7,227 bags of coffee pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>But the July contract's ability to rebuff a test of chart resistance at 225.00 cents and fears the market was well overbought, sparked waves of speculative liquidation, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market went up 30 cents in four days and it was overdue for a correction,&quot; one trader said. &quot;It's shaken up the confidence of some longs and got them ready to take profits.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, traders pegged near-term support was at the day's low of 211.50 basis July and said a breach of that level could lead to a test of 203.00.</p>
<p>Volume as of 1100 EDT, reached an estimated 3,945 lots, traders said.</p>
