<p>German coffee traders said the possible purchase of roaster Eduscho by competitor Tchibo could create a concentration of purchasing power pressurising an increasingly competitive raw materials market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's early days and unclear whether the purchase will be given approval but the two companies might become a very demanding customer,&quot; a source at an international trade house said.</p>
<p>&quot;This could, at its worst, lead to lower purchasing prices and narrow traders' margins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Retail prices may come under pressure as the competition reacts -- the consumer would benefit from lower prices.&quot;</p>
<p>The two companies said they had no plans to merge operations, should the deal be given the go-ahead, but would continue to be run as two separate entities with individual company profiles.</p>
<p>Under the envisaged deal, Tchibo Holding AG, which comprises coffee roasting, consumer goods and cigarettes and is Germany's second largest roaster, would buy Eduscho GmbH &amp; Co KG as of January 1, pending monopoly authority approval.</p>
<p>Eduscho usually is the number three in the market, but in weak periods may slip to number four or five when competitors Melitta Kaffee GmbH and Aldi pursue low-price campaigns.</p>
<p>Eduscho spokesman Rolf Helmbrecht said the move would bring chances to co-ordinate sales of consumer goods, confectionery and drinks, which both companies sell in their tied outlets alongside coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;These sales account for nearly half the turnover and could be raised if synergy was exploited,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the two companies' coffee profiles are quite different and may remain so.&quot;</p>
<p>Eduscho emphasised fresh coffee at a relatively lower cost than Tchibo which has a higher share of vacuum-packed coffee and has successfully placed expensive gourmet varieties.</p>
<p>Tchibo might be attracted by Eduscho's market leadership in Austria, where it has 150 shops compared with 620 in Germany.</p>
<p>Traders said the move was surprising and likely to worry market leader Jacobs Cafe, which derives its income from coffee alone and accounts for around 30 percent of all sales.</p>
<p>Jacobs, part of Kraft Jacobs Suchard, itself a part of the Philip Morris food group, had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The move was widely seen as a result of price fights among roasters in the fragmented German market, where sales have fallen sales since 1993 amid flagging consumer confidence.</p>
<p>German coffee association DKV expects green coffee equivalent sales of roasted and soluble coffee this year to be steady at 1995's 564,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Managing Director Frieder Rotzoll said returns from sales would be sharply lower than 1995's 9.1 billion marks ($1.3 trillion) because retail prices had fallen.</p>
<p>German retail prices per 0.5 kg of roasted coffee averaged seven marks in 1996, broadly in line with Jacobs prices, but they had eased 0.50 marks since January, Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Tchibo products usually cost around one mark more and Eduscho usually ranges between the average and Tchibo.</p>
<p>Among raw materials trends, traders feared the two firms might swap notes about traders and change buying patterns.</p>
<p>The trade, if under pressure from lower buy offers, might look to replace expensive origins with cheaper ones to fulfil orders at lower costs, but this could impair quality.</p>
