<p>A Michigan federal judge on Wednesday handed a victory to women suing Dow Chemical Co. for breast implant claims by allowing the first two phases of a Louisiana class action lawsuit to proceed.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Denise Page Hood granted part of an emergency plaintiff request for a &quot;mandatory abstention&quot; to avoid an untimely delay in the two-month-old trial.</p>
<p>&quot;The judicial system's high regard for the jury's service must be kept intact. Discharging the jury at this time would defeat this aim,&quot; Hood wrote in an opinion.</p>
<p>The trial -- one of the first class action suits to go to trial against the Midland, Mich.-based chemical giant -- had been halted earlier this month by an appeals court ruling that consolidated all breast implant cases against Dow Chemical and Corning Inc. in the Eastern District of Michigan.</p>
<p>The first phase of the four-phase trial began jury selection March 17 in Louisiana Civil District in New Orleans before Judge Yada Magee. The trial has generated 5,000 pages of testimony and arguments and about 300 exhibits.</p>
<p>Hood's order applies to the first two phases of the trial. During those parts, jurors must determine if Dow Chemical bears responsibility for alleged injuries of eight of the 1,813 class members because of its silicone testing.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical admits it tested silicone for its Dow Corning Corp. joint venture with Corning, but denies the tests were for silicone gel breast implants. The companies each own 50 percent of Dow Corning, at one time the world's largest maker of silicone gel breast implants.</p>
<p>If Dow Chemical is found liable, then jurors must decide if the eight women's illnesses were caused by their implants. Plaintiff attorneys estimate the second phase will conclude by July.</p>
<p>Hood did not grant an abstention for the third and fourth phases, which cover the majority of the class. Those phases consist of notification and separate trials for each of the remaining class members. Defense attorneys said that process could take years.</p>
<p>Plaintiff attorneys could not be reached for comment. Despite Hood's decision, Dow Chemical spokesman John Musser said the company is pleased she did not stop the transfer of the majority of cases to her court.</p>
<p>Musser said Dow Chemical attorneys are reviewing the opinion but have not made any decisions on whether to appeal the ruling.</p>
<p>&quot;It's being carefullly reviewed as to what those next steps would be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a May 8 decision, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that all state and federal implant suits against Dow Chemical and Corning should be consolidated in federal court in Detroit.</p>
<p>Dow Corning is operating under bankruptcy court protection. Thousands of breast implant cases filed against it have already been consolidated in Michigan federal court.</p>
<p>Women with the breast implants have alleged the implants cause numerous health problems, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
