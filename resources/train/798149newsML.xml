<title>JAPAN: SONY, PHILIPS, H-P SEEK DVD-RAM FORMAT APPROVAL.</title>
<headline>SONY, PHILIPS, H-P SEEK DVD-RAM FORMAT APPROVAL.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-08-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sony Corp said on Wednesday that it, Philips Electronics NV and Hewlett-Packard Co have asked European computer makers for approval of a format for DVD-RAMs (digital video disc random-access memories).  </p>
<p>The three companies applied to the European Computer Manufacturers Association for approval of their format in May, a spokesman for Sony said.</p>
<p>He said he did not know when the European body would give its approval, but it would probably take six months to a year.</p>
<p>The three companies are members of a group of 10 major electronic equipment makers, including Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd and Hitachi Ltd, that agreed on a common DVD-RAM format in April.</p>
<p>The Sony spokesman said the company will remain as a member of the group but does not plan to introduce products based on the common format.</p>
<p>He also said the three companies' DVD-RAM format is more  compatible with DVD-ROMs (read-only memories), which are already used in personal computers, than the common format.</p>
<p>The three companies' format has a data storage capacity of 3.0 gigabits, compared with the common format's 2.6 gigabits.  </p>
<p>The move by the three companies effectively creates two separate standards for the technology -- one developed by the Sony-Philips-Hewlett group, and the existing common format.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Matsushita said: &quot;We are surprised. But as we do not know the details yet, we cannot comment further.&quot;  </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Victor Co of Japan, Toshiba Corp, Pioneer Electronic Corp and Hitachi, which are also members of the group of 10 companies, were unavailable for comment due to summer holidays. The other two companies in the group are Thomson SA and Time Warner Inc.</p>
<p>The consortium's member firms, which jointly developed DVD technology, are at odds over royalties and licensing fees.</p>
<p>In April, Sony said it and Philips and Pioneer had started licensing their patents on manufacturing technology for DVDs.</p>
<p>The licences will be provided for a royalty of 3.5 percent for DVD players and five U.S. cents per disc, Sony said.</p>
<p>But obtaining a licence from the three companies would not be sufficient to allow a company to begin making DVD products because patents held by them cover only part of the technology needed to make the products.</p>
