<title>USA: U.S. prostate cancer rate dropping.</title>

<p>After increasing sharply for several years, the U.S. prostate cancer rate dropped 16 percent for white men and stabilised for black men in 1992-93, according to new public health data released Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the authors of the report based on data from the National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Census Bureau, which appears Wednesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, said the trend may be mostly a reflection of changed screening practices.</p>
<p>The steep increase in prostate cancer seen in 1989-92 was attributed largely to the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests. But in 1992 the age-adjusted cancer rate dropped for white men and leveled off for black men.</p>
<p>NCI researcher Ray Merrill and his co-authors said the lower rates may be due to less widespread use of PSA testing because of all the unresolved questions about what to do when early prostate cancer is detected.</p>
<p>&quot;The decline may have resulted from a fall in the use of PSA for screening and detection,&quot; they wrote, adding that more research was needed into the causes of the trend.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men, particularly black men. Median age at diagnosis is 72 and two-thirds of the deaths occur at age 75 or older.</p>
<p>The NCI reported last week that cancer death rates had declined overall from 1990-95 and prostate cancer death rates had shown one of the sharpest drops, 6.3 percent.</p>
