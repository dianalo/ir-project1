<title>TAIWAN: Taiwanese want state action to protect Diaoyus.</title>
<headline>Taiwanese want state action to protect Diaoyus.</headline>

<p>Most Taiwanese want the government to maintain a tough stance towards Japan on the disputed Diaoyu islands, a poll published on Monday showed.</p>
<p>As many as 69 percent of 982 people interviewed by the mass circulation United Daily News said they wanted the government to send vessels to protect the uninhabited East China Sea islands from Japan. Only 14 percent opposed such action.</p>
<p>The poll was taken between Saturday and Sunday. No margin of error was given.</p>
<p>Some 58 percent of respondents said they were dissatisified with the Nationalist government's handling of the dispute over the Diaoyu islands with Japan, saying Taipei's stance was too soft, the poll said.</p>
<p>Taiwan residents on Sunday formed an alliance to protect the Diaoyus from Japan and threatened to organise mass protests against what they called Tokyo's invasion.</p>
<p>The Diaoyus, known as the Senkakus in Japanese, are about 300 km (190 miles) west of Japan's Okinawa island and 200 km (125 miles) east of Taiwan.</p>
<p>The long-simmering dispute flared in July after Japanese rightists were found to have built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands, prompting protests from Taiwan as well as China, which also claims sovereignty over the Diaoyus.</p>
<p>Japanese coast guard ships in recent days have kept several private Taiwanese boats away from the island, displaying signs asserting Japan's sovereignty.</p>
<p>Taiwan's foreign ministry has protested to Japan over the Diaoyu issue, urging Tokyo to use restraint, and said it was delighted by local shows of patriotism.</p>
<p>Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with Japan, which recognises Beijing's government.</p>
<p>Japan's moves to assert sovereignty over the Diaoyus have angered Chinese in Hong Kong and the mainland as well as in Taiwan, uniting the three regions despite their political differences.</p>
<p>Respondents were mixed when asked whether they would support military actions taken by China to protect the Diaoyus. Some 38 percent said they would while 45 percent said they would not.</p>
<p>China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war separated them in 1949.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been the most active to date, with 200 fishing boats threatening in July to sail to the Diaoyus and tear down the lighthouse built by the rightist Japan Youth Federation.</p>
<p>The protest was cancelled in August after Japanese officials came to Taiwan to discuss related disputes over fishing rights and the Japanese group halted plans to further assert Tokyo's claim to the islands.</p>
