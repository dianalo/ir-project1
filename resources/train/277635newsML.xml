<p>Zimbabwe's share market was quiet on Friday and many industrial counters traded at their pre-Christmas levels, but brokers said the outlook remained bullish.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes were low today, with trade squeezed by the holidays and the weekend,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;The trading volumes and share prices may continue low to stable until the New Year, but the market is strong on sentiment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) is expected to stay bullish for up to three months on expectations that the southern African state's economy will grow by around seven percent in 1997 from an estimated five percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The ZSE's 57-counter industrial index gained 3.55 points to 8,748.00 --- a 130.27-point surge on the week -- boosted mainly by some 10-cent gain in Zimbabwe Newspapers at 2,000 and pork producer Colcom, which traded 15 cents higher at 375.</p>
<p>In minings, nickel producer Bindura traded at its pre-Christmas level of 750 and the secondary seven-share mining closed the day unchanged at 1,066.34 -- 0.66 points down on the week.</p>
