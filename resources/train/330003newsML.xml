<title>SOMALIA: EU envoy meets Somali faction leader Aideed.</title>
<headline>EU envoy meets Somali faction leader Aideed.</headline>

<p>Somali faction leader Hussein Aideed met the European Union's special envoy in Mogadishu on Friday after the lifting of a nine-month ban on his visiting Somalia.</p>
<p>EU Special Envoy Sigurd Illing told reporters he and Aideed discussed reconciliation between Somalis and what humanitarian aid could be sent to drought-stricken areas of the country.</p>
<p>Illing was barred by Aideed's late father, Mohamed Farah Aideed, from visiting Somalia last April after he was accused of entering the country illegally and formenting civil strife.</p>
<p>Hussein Aideed was elected Somalia's president by supporters last August after his father's death but his government only controls part of the country from a south Mogadishu stronghold.</p>
<p>The ban on Illing was lifted on January 20 shortly before a meeting and peace agreement mediated by an Italian envoy between Hussein Aideed and his arch-enemy Ali Mahdi Mohamed, based in north Mogadishu.</p>
<p>Aideed's government, which has campaigned in vain for Aideed to be addressed as president by foreign envoys, said there had been a misunderstanding between it and Illing because of poor communication and invited the envoy to visit south Mogadishu.</p>
<p>Illing was scheduled to meet Ali Mahdi on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hussein Aideed's Radio South Mogadishu said he urged Illing to lobby for the tightening of a United Nations arms embargo on Somalia and to intervene to stop Ethiopian incursions into western Somalia.</p>
<p>The anarchic Horn of Africa country has been devastated by faction fighting since 1991 after rebels overthrew late president Mohamed Siad Barre and turned their guns on each other in vicious fighting which killed thousands of people.</p>
