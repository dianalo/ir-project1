<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- cash finishes 1/4 higher.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bond futures prices closed 1/4 point higher, while cash ended flat as Friday's March employment report made the sidelines a popular destination.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a couple of things going on, but there is really no price appreciation at all, so I have the market unchanged,&quot; a trader said. &quot;I think the jury is going to be out until this unemployment number gets out of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>A municipal analyst also described the market as unchanged in light action.</p>
<p>The trader however cited &quot;a little bit of a positive spin&quot; at work in munis, tied to stock market losses earlier in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;When stocks were down a lot lower in here the market obviously had a better bid to it,&quot; he said. &quot;I think people were looking over their shoulder at where the Dow was going. The old guys anyway expect some kind of a trend towards quality.&quot;</p>
<p>While those reallocation trades have yet to materialize, some players are showing interest in long municipals, &quot;even though the percentages make no sense against Treasuries,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been and are getting richer, but the absolute levels where we are, we haven't seen in a while,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Wednesday's active issues included Delaware River Port Authority of Pennsylvania and New Jersey 5-1/2 percent revenue bonds of 2026. The bonds were bid at 5.85 percent net yield, a basis point weaker than Tuesday's closing net bid of 5.84 percent.</p>
<p>Alabama Housing Finance Authority 6.0 percent bonds of 2021 were bid at a dollar price of 98-5/8, up from Tuesday's closing bid of 98-1/4.</p>
<p>In the government market, the benchmark 30-year bond closed up 1/32 at 94-14/32 to yield 7.07 percent. In debt futures, the June municipal contract closed up 8/32 at 112-4/32. The June T-bond contract closed up 3/32 at 107-18/32. The MOB spread was 146 ticks.</p>
<p>As for Friday's employment report, economists polled by Reuters expect March non-farm payrolls to grow by 182,000 versus last month's 339,000 rise.</p>
<p>Turning to new issues, JP Morgan Securities Inc repriced $60 million New York State Dormitory Authority bonds for Pace University. Yields were adjusted in several maturities, but the top yield in 2026 remained unchanged at 5.95 percent. The bonds were MBIA insured.</p>
<p>PaineWebber Inc also repriced $45 million North Carolina Housing Finance Agency bonds, but left the top yield in 2028 unchanged at 6.25 percent.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to Thursday, three negotiated bond sales are scheduled totaling $196.9 million. A $135.9 million Connecticut Health &amp; Educational Facilities Authority offering via Lehman Brothers tops the list.</p>
<p>Ten competitive sales totaling $35.2 million are scheduled. The largest is a $9 million New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority deal at 1100 EST.</p>
