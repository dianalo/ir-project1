<p>Mother Teresa, recovering from heart surgery and impatient to get back to her work with the poor and dying, on Friday jokingly demanded an ambulance to take her home, doctors said.</p>
<p>They said the Roman Catholic nun, in a playful mood, telephoned the headquarters of her Missionaries of Charity religious order and asked one of the nuns to send an ambulance to carry her home.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Sister, this is Mother Teresa. You know I am going home tomorrow. Get things ready and make arrangements for the ambulance to pick me up,&quot; a regular medical update by doctors at Calcutta's B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre quoted her saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctors later explained to her that she needs a few more days in the hospital,&quot; the bulletin added.</p>
<p>Although she is seriously ill, Mother Teresa has been begging doctors to let her return to her work with the downtrodden.</p>
<p>Doctors have ruled out any prospect of her going home soon.</p>
<p>The 86-year-old nun had heart surgery on November 29, for the third time in five years, to clear two blocked coronary arteries. Long-standing lung and kidney trouble, coupled with an irregular heartbeat, delayed her recovery.</p>
<p>Doctors who successfully regulated her heartbeat with a mild electric shock on Wednesday said her recovery was being held up by a nagging case of bronchitis.</p>
<p>On Friday, doctors said the congestion in her lungs had improved. Her pneumonia had cleared up, but she still had bronchitis, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;She requires respiratory, physiotherapy and intravenous medication support to keep her somewhat stable,&quot; the doctors said in a bulletin.</p>
<p>The revered nun was cheerful and talkative, the bulletin said. &quot;She met some of her newly professed sisters of the Missionaries of Charity,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>An earlier bulletin said Mother Teresa had some lung congestion overnight which had responded to therapy. She has been receiving regular chest massages to help clear it up.</p>
<p>&quot;Mother Teresa is still not out of danger,&quot; the update said.</p>
<p>The clinic said the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner walked unsupported for the first time for a short distance outside her room in the intensive therapy unit.</p>
<p>&quot;Families who pray together stay together. Love each other, then you will have peace,&quot; clinic official A.K. Chatterjee quoted Mother Teresa as telling the medical staff.</p>
<p>Doctors have said they would like her to be back at her religious order by Christmas, but that there is no assurance.</p>
<p>They have cautioned that her recovery will be slow and she might never be as active as before.</p>
