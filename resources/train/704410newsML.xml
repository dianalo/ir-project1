<p>One of Canada's biggest tobacco companies signalled on Thursday it would fight back against British Columbia's efforts to force the industry to pay medical costs for treating smokers.</p>
<p>&quot;Lawsuits commenced against (Rothman's) will be vigorously defended,&quot; Rothman's Benson and Hedges Chief Executive Joe Heffernan wrote in a letter to British Columbia Health Minister Joy MacPhail.</p>
<p>He added in the letter released on Thursday that Rothman's hoped to open discussions with the Canadian province on &quot;tobacco issues.&quot;</p>
<p>British Columbia officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>British Columbia last month introduced legislation laying the groundwork for it to file a class action suit against tobacco companies to recoup medical costs.</p>
<p>The action would be similar to that taken by 37 U.S. states and would make British Columbia the first government outside the United States to take such a step.</p>
<p>U.S. tobacco companies and the states recently announced a proposed $386.5 billion settlement of those claims.</p>
<p>Heffernan said it was unlikely that &quot;recent events in the United States can easily be replicated in British Columbia...due to Canada's significantly different history of tobacco regulation and taxation.&quot;</p>
<p>He rejected the province's demands, which included a public acknowledgement by the company that smoking was addictive, changes to marketing practices and the payment of costs for treating smokers and smoking prevention programs.</p>
<p>The British Columbia government has said it expects to file a lawsuit against tobacco manufacturers in coming months. Before it does, it wants the tobacco industry to compensate it voluntarily for tobacco-related illness and smoking prevention programs.</p>
<p>MacPhail has estimated the province's direct and indirect medical costs related to smoking and the price of smoking prevention programs at about C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) a year.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Rothman's, Canada's second biggest cigarette maker, is 60 percent-owned by Rothmans Inc. and 40 percent by Philip Morris Cos Inc..</p>
<p>Rothmans Inc. is a unit of Rothmans International Plc RIN_.L, which is owned by Swiss luxury goods holding company Cie Financiere Richmont AG.</p>
