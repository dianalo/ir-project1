<p>India's sugar output in the 1996/97 (October-September) season is expected to drop sharply compared to last season but existing stocks are likely to cushion the fall, a senior industry official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sufficient surplus stocks. A dip in output cannot wipe out the surplus,&quot; Shanti Lal Jain, director general of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), told Reuters.</p>
<p>ISMA has estimated 1996/97 sugar production at 14 million tonnes, down from an all-time high of 16.5 million tonnes posted in the previous year.</p>
<p>Jain said the yield per acre for sugarcane had decreased by about 15 percent to 17 percent across the country, and this would lead to a decline in sugar output.</p>
<p>There has also been a delay in the start of sugarcane crushing operations, he added.</p>
<p>The expected downturn in output was &quot;not worrisome&quot; as India had started the new sugar season with a record eight million tonnes of carry-over stocks, compared with five million the previous season, Jain said.</p>
<p>The expected lower output was also due to expectations that sugarcane growers would diversify to other crops.</p>
<p>&quot;The diversion is going to be sizeable due to the inability of the mills to pay the high state-advised prices due to low sugar prices,&quot; Jain said.</p>
<p>India has abolished licences for many industries under an economic reform programme that began in 1991, but it has kept sugar under the old regime, which subsidises prices for consumers and protects producers.</p>
<p>Sugar supplies and pricing in India are controlled by the government. The mills supply 40 percent of their output as levy at a subsidised rate for distribution among the poor and sell the rest in the open market.</p>
<p>The Indian cabinet is expected to decide soon on a Food Ministry's proposal to increase the issue price of levy sugar by 1.60 rupees a kg. The current issue price is 9.05 rupees a kg.</p>
<p>Issue price is the rate at which the government supplies sugar at subsidised prices to the state-owned shops for sale to the poor.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they are going to announce the new prices next week,&quot; Jain said.</p>
<p>He said actual sugar exports in 1996/97 are expected to be much lower than the target of one million tonnes set by the government.</p>
<p>India exported just over one million tonnes of sugar in 1995/96.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think exports will be more than 400,000 tonnes in the current season due to the absence of a clear-cut policy. For the last 20 days, everything is in a lull,&quot; Jain said.</p>
<p>Last month President Shankar Dayal Sharma approved an ordinance to end the export monopoly of the Indian Sugar and General Industries Import-Export Corp (ISGIEC), a private agency.</p>
<p>Analysts said the move could lead to competing mills undercutting export prices, and export sales drying up as traders were exposed to mounting losses.</p>
<p>&quot;There is big confusion. We are waiting for clear policy guidelines for sugar exports,&quot; Jain said.</p>
