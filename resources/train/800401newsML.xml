<p>Israel on Thursday partly demolished five Palestinian homes in the West Bank it said were built illegally, witnesses and the army said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Israeli bulldozers under army guard levelled five annexes to homes in a compound owned by one extended family in the village of Nabi Samuel near Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israel demolished nine homes in Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;God might not get you now but you're going to have your day later,&quot; one Palestinian woman screamed at troops.</p>
<p>Peter Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli military's Civil Administration in the West Bank and Gaza, said the army demolished extensions to homes in Nabi Samuel and a house in Bir Naballah near PLO-ruled Ramallah because they were built without permits.</p>
<p>&quot;The destructions went through all the procedures according to law,&quot; Lerner said. He said the army had also removed a group of Palestinian Bedouin who had encamped on state land near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Maaleh Adumim.</p>
<p>In Nabi Samuel, members of the Barakat family cursed troops as workers reduced parts of their homes to rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;I left you and I left your religion and I left my family because what you are doing is wrong, it's wrong,&quot; Chana Barakat, an Israeli woman who married into the Barakat family and converted to Islam, shouted at troops.</p>
<p>Palestinians say they are forced to build illegally because Israel will not give them permits. Palestinian rights groups have accused Israel of exploiting last month's suicide bombing in an Israeli market as a cover for the demolitions.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all part of the vengeance for the bombing,&quot; human rights lawyer Linda Breyer told Reuters. &quot;I think it's completely barbaric and has nothing to do with law. It is continuing colonisation of the territories.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state. Israel, which captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, calls the entire city its undivided, eternal capital.</p>
