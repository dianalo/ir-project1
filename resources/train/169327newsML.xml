<p>The ruling coalition of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic won a clear victory in Sunday's Yugoslav parliamentary elections, the federal election commission said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A commission spokesman told reporters the three-party leftist coalition had won 64 seats, the opposition Zajedno coalition gained 22, the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro had 20 and the Radical Party won 16 seats.</p>
<p>The remaining seats in the 138-seat parliament were shared among the Montenegrin National Party (8), the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (3), the Vojvodina coalition (2), while the (Moslem) list for Sandzak, the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro and the Moslem Party of Democratic Action each gained one seat.</p>
<p>Ivica Dacic, spokesman for the ruling coalition comprising Milosevic's Socialist Party (SPS), the Yugoslav United Left (JUL) led by his wife Mirjana, and New Democracy, called the victory &quot;great and convincing&quot;.</p>
<p>Voters across Yugoslavia, now made up of Serbia and Montenegro, voted for a new federal parliament, a republican assembly for Montenegro and local councils across the federation.</p>
<p>In a vigorous campaign supported by state-owned media, Milosevic succeeded in wiping out the bitter memories of the death and deprivation from a four-year Balkan war he is widely blamed for helping set in motion.</p>
<p>The opposition, covering the political spectrum from liberal to right-wing nationalist, tried to capitalise on the fact that a third of the 10.5 million population are living in poverty, according to a recent Red Cross survey.</p>
<p>It promised speedy privatisation of state firms along the lines set out by popular former central bank governor Dragoslav Avramovic, who managed to unite the opposition and briefly led it before stepping down for reasons that remain unclear.</p>
<p>But the opposition was always struggling to get its message across because of the tight grip the ruling parties wield over television, the most important information medium in a country where most people are too poor to buy newspapers.</p>
<p>The clear-cut victory will enable Milosevic to consolidate his power ahead of elections in Serbia next spring, analysts say.</p>
<p>His coalition was 26 seats short of the two-thirds majority he needs to alter the Yugoslav constitution to enable him to retain power when his second and final term as Serbian president expires next year.</p>
<p>But the coalition can expect enough support in parliament from the DPS and ethnic Hungarian parties to push through the changes, analysts added.</p>
<p>Diplomats expect Milosevic to move next year into the post of Yugoslav president, which would be vested with sweeping executive powers.</p>
