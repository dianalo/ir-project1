<p>British second-tier supermarket group Somerfield Plc said on Thursday that total sales were up 1.6 percent in the first eight weeks of the current financial year, with deflation in food prices of 1.4 percent.</p>
<p>The company, floated last year, said pre-tax profits for the year were 105.4 million pounds ($176.8 million), up from 92 million a year ago. It paid out a total dividend of 10.2 pence per share.  </p>
<p>Somerfield said in a statement that sales at its Somerfield fascia stores were up 2.8 percent in the first eight weeks and operating margins continued to improve in line with expectations.</p>
<p>The company said that same-store sales during the year ending April 26 were up 1.4 percent, fuelled by inflation of 1.8 percent against a fall in volumes of 0.4 percent, although volume growth returned at 0.4 percent in the second half.</p>
<p>&quot;This year's results represent a considerable achievement in a highly competitive environment,&quot; chief executive David Simons said in a statement.</p>
<p>Somerfield said the sale of 24 of its smaller stores on July 14 for close to their book value of two milllion pounds ($3.35 million) was an important step in improving its store portfolio, adding, &quot;We look forward to a year in which we will step up the pace of new store openings.&quot;</p>
