<p>The leaders of Georgia and its rebel province of Abkhazia pledged on Friday to resolve their differences peacefully but reported no breakthrough on an overall agreement to end their conflict.</p>
<p>Abkhazia has had de facto independence since routing Georgian government forces in fighting in 1992-93 which cost 10,000 lives. But it is not recognised by any state.</p>
<p>A statement, signed by Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and Abkhaz separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba at the end of their talks, said the sides agreed &quot;to take upon themselves the obligation not to use arms to resolve differences between them and under no circumstances to allow a resumption of bloodshed.</p>
<p>&quot;Only peaceful political methods through negotiations should be used,&quot; it went on. It said the two sides &quot;managed to agree on a series of key problems on resolving the conflict. But at the same time, there remain significant differences&quot;.</p>
<p>Ardzinba's surprise visit was his first to Tbilisi since the war began exactly five years ago, when Georgian troops marched into the subtropical province on the Black Sea to put down moves towards independence.</p>
<p>Western diplomats and U.N. officials have told Abkhaz leaders that there is no prospect of recognition as an independent state.</p>
<p>Talks on reaching a full political agreement have been deadlocked and the latest round of United Nations-mediated negotiations has produced no tangible results.</p>
<p>The tussle with Abkhazia is one of several bloody conflicts which have bedevilled Georgia since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Shevardnadze, humiliated by the loss of what many consider the most beautiful and richest part of the country, sees his role in Georgian history as recovering the province.</p>
<p>Though the meeting was an important step forward, they reported no breakthrough on an overall political agreement which would put an end to the conflict.</p>
<p>The statement signed by Shevardnadze and Ardzinba said the sides agreed &quot;to take upon themselves the obligation not to use arms to resolve differences between them and under no circumstances to allow a resumption of bloodshed.</p>
<p>Shevardnadze, speaking after the signing, called the talks a &quot;major political event (which had) overcome a very complicated and difficult psychological barrier&quot;.</p>
<p>Ardzinba also sounded a positive note. &quot;I consider this meeting extremely important. We had very fruitful and constructive talks,&quot; he said, adding that they would help to restore trust between the sides destroyed during the war.</p>
<p>The two men gave no indication when more negotiations might be held.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov accompanied Ardzinba and acted as a mediator during some of the talks.</p>
<p>Primakov had said he hoped to prepare a deal between Georgia and Abkhazia to pave the way for a formal peace agreement to be signed in Moscow in the presence of President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has recently supported the Georgian position that Abkhazia should be part of Georgia but receive wide autonomy, and that the separatist government should allow at least 150,000 ethnic Georgian refugees to return to their homes.</p>
<p>Abkhazia has argued for a type of &quot;union state&quot; confederation, repeatedly rejected by Tbilisi.</p>
<p>Russia also has 1,500 peacekeepers in a buffer zone between Abkhazia and Georgia.</p>
