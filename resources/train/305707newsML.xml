<p>Standard &amp; Poor's public information (pi) ratings on nine Malaysian banks indicates many of them do not measure up to international standards, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at the ratings it would seem that a lot of (Malaysian) banks are not up to international standards yet, although domestically they may be seen as healthy,&quot; said the head of financial institutions division at a research house.</p>
<p>Public information ratings, a new service started by S&amp;P late last year, are based on publicly disclosed information and do not rely on S&amp;P receiving access to the rated banks' management.</p>
<p>While the ratings are not a fully-fledged evaluation of the banks, they are expected to influence international views of Malaysia's financial institutions.</p>
<p>S&amp;P's ratings on the nine banks ranged from A-pi to BB-pi, with Public Bank Bhd assigned A-pi.</p>
<p>The agency gave BBB-pi ratings to Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd, Bank of Commerce Bhd and Perwira Affin Bank Bhd</p>
<p>It gave BB-pi ratings to Ban Hin Lee Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, Multi-Purpose Bank Bhd, Sime Bank Bhd and Southern Bank Bhd.</p>
<p>By S&amp;P definition, ratings of BB and below are speculative or non-investment grade.</p>
<p>&quot;The ratings do not augur well for the banks. This might get them into trouble with the correspondent banks overseas,&quot; the research house analyst said.</p>
<p>He said if the foreign banks took the ratings seriously, it could affect the credit lines they may have given to Malaysian banks, and they may also have to pay higher interest rates on their international borrowings.</p>
<p>But some analysts said the ratings only provided broad indications.</p>
<p>&quot;The ratings are based on published information. How accurate they are, is something we do not know. We also don't know why they are doing it now,&quot; said Jeffrey Tan Cheong Chai, manager with the Rating Agency Malaysia Bhd (RAM).</p>
<p>He said these were not official ratings by S&amp;P.</p>
<p>&quot;The public information rating is not a complete evaluation. It does not, for example, take into account information like future direction, corporate vision, management strategy and profit forecasts,&quot; said an analyst with a government-backed research agency.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the ratings may force some of the banks to seek an official rating with S&amp;P to improve their standing.</p>
