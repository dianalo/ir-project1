<p>The benchmark U.S. 30-year bond was off more than a full point at 94-18/32 to yield 7.07 percent in technicals-driven trade, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of it is dealer selling more than anything else,&quot; said Matthey Alexy, chief market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. &quot;The technicals are pretty ugly.&quot;  </p>
<p>The selloff began after Thursday morning's economic data and continued as the bond yield held above 7.0 percent, which had been seen by many as a key support level.</p>
<p>The data showed existing home sales grew swiftly in February and help wanted advertising picked up as well.</p>
<p>Reported comments by former Federal Reserve officials Lyle Gramley and Alan Blinder that additional rate hikes were likely in order to slow the economy were not seen as a large factor in the selloff.</p>
