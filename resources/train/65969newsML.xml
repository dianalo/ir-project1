<p>Troops with sniffer dogs combed mountains and beaches in South Korea on Thursday for up to nine North Koreans after 11 of their companions were shot dead in the most serious infiltration since the 1960s.</p>
<p>A dusk-to-dawn curfew was lifted and thousands of armed troops and police who cordoned off the search area overnight began moving in on their prey.</p>
<p>Authorities believe around 20 North Koreans landed on Wednesday in a submarine, now stranded on rocks near the east coast city of Kangnung, in a flagrant breach of an armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War and sealed the division of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Bloodsoaked bodies of 11 North Koreans were found huddled together at the top of a mountain on Wednesday, apparently shot by their leader who then turned the gun on himself.</p>
<p>Communist espionage agents from North Korean have in the past chosen suicide over capture.</p>
<p>No sightings of the fugitives have been reported since Wednesday night, when two of them burst into a villager's home and stole food and cigarettes after brandishing a pistol.</p>
<p>Soon after that, news reports said two North Koreans exchanged gunfire with their pursuers in a 15-minute skirmish near Kangnung's airport.</p>
<p>Rain lashed much of South Korea overnight, and with helicopters and a reconnaisance plane joining the search the capture of the North Koreas, dead or alive, appeared to be only a matter of time.</p>
<p>One infiltrator who was captured alive was quoted by local media as saying the submarine drifted into Southern waters after developing engine trouble.</p>
<p>His dead colleagues were members of the vessel's crew, not trained saboteurs, Lee Kang-soo, 31, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>South Korean authorities maintain the incident was a deliberate provocation, and it has further raised tensions between the two hostile neighbours who face each other across the world's most heavily fortified border.</p>
<p>Troops who boarded the abandoned grey craft, now bobbing helplessly in the shallows, found automatic guns and ammunition along with canned food and shoes.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has not commented on the drama, one of the deadliest since 1968 when 31 North Koreans reached the presidential Blue House in Seoul. Twenty-eight were killed in a gunbattle in which 34 Southern troops, police and civilians also died.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, armed North Korean troops staged illegal exercises in a border buffer zone, and following that scare U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean head of state Kim Young-sam made a peace overture to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>They proposed four-way talks, also including China, but North Korea has yet to respond.</p>
<p>However, there had been hopeful signs that Pyongyang was being lured out of its hostile isolation in its desperation for help to ease a food crisis.</p>
<p>Over the weekend several hundred foreign investors were feted at a North Korean free-trade zone. South Korea boycotted the event in a row over invitations, but on Tuesday a faxed message to South Korean Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung attempted to patch up the quarrel by inviting a Southern delegation to the Rajin-Sonbong zone for an exclusive look.</p>
<p>Previous bouts of North Korean sabre-rattling have been interpreted by North Korea watchers as deliberate attempts by Pyongyang hardliners to sabotage detente moves.</p>
