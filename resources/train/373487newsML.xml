<p>The New York Times reported the following stories on its front page on Wednesday:</p>
<p>* President Clinton and Congressional leaders exited their meeting on Tuesday agreeing on five goals: a tax credit to encourage welfare hiring, education reform, improving juvenile justice, tax cuts, and using the District of Columbia as a testing ground for ideas in education, employment and economic growth.</p>
<p>* The drive to reform the nation's campaign finance laws is losing steam on Capitol Hill among both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>* New York City officials removed the entire staff of the city's only shelter for battered women after investigators found staffers had sex with the women, used drugs and allowed abusive husbands and boyfriends in at night.</p>
<p>* Some aides to former New York City mayor David Dinkins say Dinkins will decide against running for mayor again.</p>
<p>* Serbians are training an elite Zairian unit for combat in Zaire's civil war.</p>
<p>* Stephen Hawking, the author of &quot;A Brief History of Time,&quot; has acknowledged defeat in a bet he made six years ago with two professors at the California Institute of Technology regarding &quot;singularities,&quot; which are believed to be at the heart of black holes in space.</p>
<p>* Despite having won the election, President Clinton is running the White House in a way that looks like a campaign, using the same campaign polling firm to gauge national opinion, making public appearances that echo those during the election and even using the same music.</p>
