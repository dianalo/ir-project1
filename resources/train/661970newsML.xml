<p>Forces loyal to former government commander Ahmad Shah Masood are battling for a big airbase north of Kabul after gaining ground from the fundamentalist Taleban militia, a military source said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The source, who asked not to be named, said Masood's guerrillas had launched a major attack on Thursday, driving the Taleban out of the key town of Jabal-os-Siraj, 70 km (44 miles) north of Kabul, and were now fighting for the Soviet-built Bagram airbase, 50 km (31 miles) from the capital.  </p>
<p>The source said the Taleban had repulsed an assault on Bagram on Friday, but fighting was continuing.</p>
<p>He said Masood's forces had advanced southwards along the road from Jabal-os-Siraj and were fighting for control of a damaged bridge at Pul-i-Matak, north of the town of Charikar.</p>
<p>Masood captured Jabal-os-Siraj about two weeks ago, cutting off a Taleban force that had crossed the Salang Pass through the Hind Kush mountains into opposition-held northern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Taleban fought back, but were unable to reopen the pass to resupply their comrades, who were driven from their last foothold in the north when the town of Pul-i-Khumri fell to opposition forces on Wednesday.</p>
