<headline>IBCA assigns BB plus l-term currency to Russia.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Monday it had assigned a long-term, foreign currency rating of BB plus to Russia.  </p>
<p>IBCA said in a statement the rating would be assigned to the senior, unsecured feorign currency obliagions of Russia -- including the forthcoming debut eurobond -- and would also act as a ceiling for the ratings assigned by IBCA to Russian banks, corporates and municipalities planning to come to the international markets.  </p>
<p>IBCA said Russia's rating was underpinned by the strong growth of export receipts from oil and gas, which had continued throughout the transition slump, and which had ensured consistent surpluses on the current account of the balance of payments.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia also benefits from relatively low external debt ratios despite the decision to assume all the external debt of the former Soviet Union, of which it formed just one of fifteen successor states and accounted for half the population,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The official GDP figures do not fully represent what is happening to activity in the economy, IBCA believes, as they paint a picture of steadily declining output for six years, the statement added,</p>
<p>&quot;But other indicators - such as real incomes, consumer spending and electricity output - all suggest that the Russian economy is now growing.&quot;  </p>
<p>IBCA aaid the potential for future growth was particularly strong given the easy availability of foreign currency earnings, the increasing consensus on the need for sound macro-economic policies, and the high educational level of the population which is similar to western Europe rather than a typical country with Russia's living standards such as Brazil.</p>
<p>It also said Russia benefits from a special interest the international community has in its stability, which had led to the availability of credit (from Germany and France) earlier this year and to a special status such as de facto membership of the Group of Seven - now eight - leading industrial countries.  </p>
<p>But IBCA warend that there were &quot;important political risks and other obstacles to growth&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;President Yeltsin's health means that potential successors may put their personal rivalries ahead of their interest in sound policy, thus creating uncertainty about the reform process,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;An early election could result in a populist or Communist -supported government, and this could be a serious - albeit probably temporary - setback for macro-economic stability and renewed growth.&quot;  </p>
<p>IBCA also said it assigned a short-term foreign currency rating of B to Russia's obligations with a maturity of less than one year.</p>
