<p>South Africa defused a foreign policy row on Wednesday, saying it would consult Washington before making a decision on a big arms sale to Syria opposed by the United States and Israel.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the move, taken at a cabinet meeting and announced by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, would lower the heat in a dispute where both sides seemed to have overplayed their hands.</p>
<p>The proposed sale to Syria of South African tank firing and guidance systems, which came to light via a leak of cabinet papers this month, provoked a warning from Washington and an angry riposte from President Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>A spokesman in Pretoria said a final decision on whether to go ahead with bidding for the deal would be made at a cabinet meeting in the future but no date was set.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not set a timeframe for its completion,&quot; Mbeki later told reporters.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to consult political parties at home -- the main opposition parties oppose the deal -- and South African &quot;Zionists&quot; as well as Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;It really does depend on this process of consultation...We want to act with some speed to conclude it and so that government then can take a decision,&quot; he said. &quot;We will, as part of the process of consultation, speak to the United States government.&quot;</p>
<p>The deferral, and the conciliatory tone, came as little surprise to analysts who noted it came ahead of next month's bilateral commission meeting with the United States, to be co-chaired in Cape Town by Mbeki and Vice-President Al Gore.</p>
<p>&quot;It was what I expected, given the fact that both sides have overplayed their hands quite substantially,&quot; said Jakkie Cilliers of the Institute of Security Studies in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>&quot;Mandela as well as his spokesman clearly overreacted last week,&quot; he added, referring to the 78-year-old president's angry rejection of alleged public bullying by the United States.</p>
<p>Analysts said the exchanges had overblown the dispute. The &quot;Tiger New-generation Fire Control System&quot;, designed for the Soviet T-72 tank used by Syria, is a computer-based range-finding and aiming system which uses lasers and advanced optics to improve firepower.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole argument that this single sale would destabilise the Middle East military balance is over the top,&quot; Cilliers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would put the Syrian tank on not quite a par with the Israeli tank, but that's only one part of the equation. Israel's edge has always been in the doctrine, training and capacity of its soldiers, not in equipment alone,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Washington, Israel's closest ally, says it objects to the sale because Syria sponsors terrorism -- a charge Damascus denies. Under U.S. law, an arms deal with Damascus would lead to a cut-off of certain forms of aid which South Africa receives.</p>
<p>However, in dollar terms alone, ignoring the diplomatic implications, the loss of aid would be vastly outweighed by the reported $650 million that the tank deal would earn.</p>
<p>Mbeki said he was anxious to avoid a repeat of the public squabble: &quot;I think it is important that we take advantage of the issue...to address the larger questions so that we don't get into this rumble again when something else happens.&quot;</p>
