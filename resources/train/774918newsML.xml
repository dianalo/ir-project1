<p>The one-hour work stoppage called by South African trade union federation Cosatu has had limited to no effect in KwaZulu-Natal province, companies said on Monday.</p>
<p>The nationwide stoppage called by the labour giant Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) was to express its unhappiness with the new Basic Conditions of Employment Bill which has already been approved by cabinet and is due to be tabled in paliament by September 15.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for the Indian Ocean province's Durban and Richards Bay harbours said they had no stoppages and work was continuing normally.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Toyota SA at its Prospecton plant said there had been limited impact. &quot;Some areas were disrupted, but not in any major way. The workers are all back at work now,&quot; said spokesman Richard Wingfield.</p>
<p>The Sapref refinery, also in Prospecton just outside Durban, was also barely hit, the company's managing director Peter Fransen told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The workers gave us a memorandum detailing their demands which was received in good faith, and then they went back to work. Production has not been affected at all,&quot; Fransen said.</p>
<p>Cosatu said it expected support for its call from over two million unionised workers in the major sectors of mining, metal and engineering, chemical and oil, motor industry and health and transport as well as the public sector.</p>
<p>Cosatu called a one-day strike in June to back its demands for six months' maternity leave, of which at least four should be paid, and a 40-hour working week to be phased in over five years.</p>
<p>Monday's stoppage will be followed by 24-hour strikes in all the major regions in the country from August 18 to August 21 -- unless agreement is reached before then.</p>
<p>Business objects to the two core demands, arguing that certain of the provisions in the bill could raise employment costs to the point of creating obstacles to new jobs.</p>
