<p>Taiwan share prices finished at another six-year high on Friday as investors welcomed recent market-boosting comments by the central bank, brokers said.</p>
<p>The benchmark stock index ended 81.68 points or 1.01 percent higher at 8,162.68.</p>
<p>Friday's close surpassed the 8,081.00 finish on Thursday and marked the index's highest level since it reached 8,569.55 on May 15, 1990.</p>
<p>Turnover was a hectic T$149.717 billion.  </p>
<p>Most sectors saw gains, with construction and paper shares rising 3.99 percent and 3.75 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Cathay Construction gained T$3.40 to T$52.50, while Pacific Construction rose T$1.60 to T$28.90.</p>
<p>Chung Hwa Pulp rose T$1.90 to T$29.90.</p>
<p>&quot;The fervour lingers and it was due mostly to recent comments by the government that it would not take new actions to restrain the market despite sharp rallies,&quot; Oliver Fang, an analyst of National Securities, said.  </p>
<p>Fang said construction shares were red-hot on Friday due mainly to a government decision to grant preferential low-interest loans for property developers.</p>
<p>Expected price hikes of pulp also boosted paper shares, he added.</p>
<p>Analysts said the central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong's pledge to refrain from intervening in the stock market despite recent sharp rallies was maintaining bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>Sheu Yuan-dong told parliament on Thursday he was &quot;a bit worried&quot; about the island's surging stock market, but the central would not intervene in the bourse.  </p>
<p>The stock index has risen more than 1,200 points so far this year.</p>
<p>A range of 8,100 to 8,250 points was seen for Saturday.</p>
