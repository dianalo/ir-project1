<p>Funding of technology and record investment levels in Silicon Valley helped push U.S. venture capital investment to a record $9.5 billion in 1996, according to a survey issued by Price Waterhouse LLP.</p>
<p>Kirk Walden, who conducts the accounting firm's survey of the venture capital market, said in an interview Sunday that the pace of overall investment growth slowed toward the end of last year, while Internet investments continued to climb.</p>
<p>Venture capital investments in the fourth quarter, typically the year's strongest period, were $2.48 billion, up just 6 percent over the 1995 period and below the record $2.8 billion in funding completed in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The sluggish year-over-year growth was the slowest since Price Waterhouse began collecting the comparative data two years ago. It was the first time it was below double digits -- declining steadily from 64 percent year-over-year in the third quarter of 1995 to 25 percent in the 1996 third quarter.</p>
<p>But the dropoff was seen partly as a sign of the enormous investments that have been made by venture capital firms since the early 1980s, requiring venture capitalists to spend more and more of their time managing existing investments.</p>
<p>&quot;Like one of my contacts in the industry said, 'It's a little like climbing Mount Everest and getting to the top, then being disappointed the mountain's not growing,'&quot; Walden said.</p>
<p>He said the slow-down in the fourth quarter also indicated that despite ample amounts of new venture capital funding being raised, firms are still being selective in the types of businesses they are willing to back.</p>
<p>&quot;I would never suggest there is a shortage of good ideas out there, but just because money is there doesn't mean it needs to be invested,&quot; said Walden. &quot;Because everything is bullish doesn't mean the marginal deals get funded.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 2,000 companies received funding in 1996, the Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey found.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, 65 percent were technology-based, with communications and software accounting for 44 percent of all venture funding. The Internet startup market remained the hottest growth market, with the 88 companies funded in the fourth quarter more than quadrupling the year-ago figure.</p>
<p>Overall, the number of Internet-related companies funded in 1996 by venture firms was six times higher than in 1995, and Walden said he expects this trend to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;Internet companies don't require a huge up-front investment, perhaps a couple of million dollars,&quot; he said, adding that these companies also tend to have identifiable near-term milestones enabling venture capitalists to judge progress.</p>
<p>A total of $332 million was invested in Internet startup companies in the fourth quarter, the survey found.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley venture capital deals continued to lead the nation, growing to $2.3 billion in 1996, or 24.1 percent of the total market, up from $1.7 billion, or 22.5 percent of the market in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Silicon Valley is the unchallenged capital of venture capital and everything that we do says it's going to stay that way,&quot; said Walden, noting that $1.8 billion of the additional $2 billion invested in 1996 over 1995 went to technology.</p>
<p>New England was second, more than doubling to $1.27 billion from just $627 million in 1995, according to Price Waterhouse.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley completed 552 deals in 1996 and 350 deals in 1995, while New England closed 330 deals in 1996, up from 226 in 1995. Other major areas of investment included the New York metropolitan region, Los Angeles-Orange County, the Midwest, the Southeast and Texas.</p>
<p>An earlier survey by Coopers &amp; Lybrand found that $10.1 billion had been raised through U.S. venture capital investments in 1996, with differences in survey techniques and accounting methods resulting in the difference. ((-sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau, +1 415 846-5400))</p>
