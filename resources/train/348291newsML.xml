<title>SWITZERLAND: UNHCR to talk to Swiss on fate of Bosnian refugees.</title>

<p>The U.N.'s refugee agency expressed concern on Friday about a Swiss government decision to give Bosnian refugess until the of April to leave.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Pamela O'Toole said UNHCR would have talks with the Swiss government to discuss the fate of Bosnian refugees in Switzerland who still needed international protection.</p>
<p>Switzerland, host to 18,000 displaced Bosnians, on Wednesday said it wanted a voluntary return of Bosnian refugees but those refusing to leave by the April deadline could face expulsion.</p>
<p>The Federal Council, or cabinet, made an exception for minors and refugee families with children and allowed them to stay in the country until April 1998, but officials said that around 8,000 Bosnian refugees would have to leave by April.</p>
<p>O'Toole said Bosnian refugees who were no longer the ethnic majority in their hometowns, couples in mixed marriages, victims of violence and ex-detainees who could not go home still needed international protection.</p>
<p>&quot;UNHCR is concerned about the future of certain categories of refugees who may not wish to go back,&quot; she said. &quot;The Swiss decision is not clear on what exactly their fate will be.&quot;</p>
<p>More than a year after the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accord ended 43 months of war in Bosnia, only 250,000 of the 2.1 million uprooted Bosnians have returned home, despite the right to return being central to the peace treaty.</p>
<p>Most are blocked from returning by the failure of the international community to push separatist leaders, mainly in Serb and Croat areas, to stop ethnic intolerance and harassment.</p>
<p>Germany has taken in 320,000 refugees, more than any other country outside former Yugoslavia.</p>
