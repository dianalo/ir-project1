<p>Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Thursday sharply criticised his African National Congress rivals and the former white government but did not admit fault in testimony to South Africa's &quot;truth commission&quot;.</p>
<p>Buthelezi, who leads the mainly Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, delivered a 760-page indictment of Nelson Mandela's ANC and the country's former white rulers to the truth commission on human rights crimes under apartheid.</p>
<p>He denied any role in the violence that has racked his KwaZulu-Natal home province for the past decade, but apologised that members of his party were drawn into conflict with supporters of the ANC -- in which around 15,000 people have been killed since the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that IFP members and supporters have been drawn into violence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I say I am sorry to South Africa for this because, although I have not orchestrated one single act of violence, I know that the buck stops right in front of me.&quot;</p>
<p>The Inkatha submission, including a catalogue of attacks on its members, gave no details of any violence blamed on Inkatha.</p>
<p>Instead, it accused the ANC of orchestrating a war and killing 420 IFP leaders since the start of last year alone.</p>
<p>Buthelezi said his party was alone in the struggle against apartheid, without the support or funding given to Mandela's ANC which had taken up arms against the apartheid governments.</p>
<p>&quot;From my side I wish to say that I am sorry for any hurt that I have caused the ANC leadership,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As we look around this room, we do not see many friends.&quot; Buthelezi told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission headed by 1984 peace laureate Desmond Tutu.</p>
<p>In an apparent reference to Tutu, an Anglican archbishop who was for decades a prominent voice of opposition to apartheid, Buthelezi said the country needed apologies from &quot;some of South Africa's more political clergy&quot;.</p>
<p>The statutory commission has been given two years to probe the human rights record of the struggle over apartheid, to pardon perpetrators of abuses and award limited compensation.</p>
<p>Deputy President Thabo Mbeki of the ANC and former president F.W. de Klerk of the National Party gave details last month of human rights violations perpetrated by their supporters and apologised for their actions.</p>
<p>But Buthelezi said on Thursday this was not enough.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that the ANC's national executive must apologize to South Africa purposefully, simply and specifically for the planting of bombs on street corners, in discos, in supermarkets and other public places,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>History showed the ANC's armed struggle was unnecessary and its support from international groups had been misguided.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a hideous distortion of political reality to say that South Africans had to die on street corners from bombs planted there...That would be hideously untrue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Inkatha chairman Frank Mdlalose told the commission about ANC plots to assassinate Buthelezi and wipe out Inkatha -- a war still being fought, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our transformation from apartheid is increasingly being revealed as a seven-day wonder. There is no peace and there is no freedom,&quot; said Mdlalose, who is premier of the Zulu heartland province of KwaZulu-Natal, site of most of the violence between the ANC and Inkatha.</p>
