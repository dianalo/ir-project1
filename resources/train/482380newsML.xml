<p>Dutch authorities will do everything in their power to track down the arsonists who firebombed the home of a Turkish immigrant family, just as they would if the family had been Dutch, prime minister Wim Kok assured a visiting Turkish delegation on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do the utmost we can to get the facts on the table,&quot; Kok said, adding he hoped the incident would not cloud relations with Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;Dutch public opinion was shocked by what happened...we reacted the same way as (we would have) if a Dutch family had been involved,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turkish State Minister Lutfu Esengun and a group of parliamentarians travelled to the Netherlands on Wednesday for a two-day visit to monitor police investigations into the attack, which killed a Turkish woman and five of her children.</p>
<p>Speaking through an interpreter, Esengun told journalists that news of the Dutch firebombing and subsequent arson attacks on two immigrant homes in Germany had shocked and enraged the Turkish people.</p>
<p>&quot;It has caused a great shock in Turkey...a similar event in Germany has caused Turkish public opinion to be further enraged,&quot; Esengun said.</p>
<p>But he said he had been encouraged by Dutch efforts to solve the crime, and urged the 25,000-strong Turkish community living in the Netherlands to keep their emotions under control.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been heartened to see the determination of the Dutch government to find the perpetrators of this crime,&quot; he said. &quot;The relations between the two countries will continue without being affected by these events.&quot;</p>
<p>The firebombing killed pregnant mother of 10, Mahi Kosedag, and five of her children, engulfing in flames the family's modest apartment in a run-down Hague neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Zeki Kosedag, a municipal worker living in the Netherlands for 20 years, gathered the rest of his children and jumped through an upstairs window to escape the blaze.</p>
<p>The authorities have so far failed to establish a motive for the attack, but there is growing speculation it could have been racially motivated.</p>
<p>The incident has shaken the Dutch perception of its society as fundamentally tolerant of other races.</p>
<p>Extreme right-wing, anti-immigrant parties have always drawn far less support in the Netherlands than in neighbouring France, Germany or Belgium, but increasingly there is a realisation that the country is not immune to xenophobia.</p>
<p>Police revealed on Wednesday that a mosque in the northern Dutch town of Emmeloord was set alight over the Easter weekend, adding preliminary investigations indicated the small fire could have been started by youths.</p>
<p>Esengun said that Turkish public opinion was convinced the attacks in the Netherlands and Germany were prompted by racist prejudice, but added &quot;we cannot say anything definite about this (Dutch) event...except guessing.&quot;</p>
<p>His remarks appeared to signal a softening of Turkey's stance in the wake of accusations by Ankara that a string of recent arson attacks in western Europe were being fostered by a general atmosphere of anti-Moslem sentiment.</p>
<p>Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Tuesday lashed out at western countries for encouraging anti-Moslem feeling and failing to punish adequately the perpetrators of racist attacks.</p>
<p>Thousands of Turkish and Dutch mourners and sympathisers turned out in The Hague last Friday for the funeral procession of the six victims who died in the Dutch fire bombing.</p>
<p>In a bizarre twist, one of the march organisers confessed on Tuesday to setting his own house on fire and Dutch media speculated that the same man was responsible for distributing racially abusive pamphlets last weekend.</p>
