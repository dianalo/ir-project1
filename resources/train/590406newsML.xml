<p>Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said Friday he did not expect Congress to pass electric utility deregulation legislation this year.</p>
<p>Lott, of Mississippi, also said Republicans will offer another package this year to limit federal regulations.</p>
<p>&quot;It may take a couple of years&quot; to pass utility deregulation legislation, Lott said at the Independent Petroleum Association of America. &quot;I don't think we can get it done this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Lott also said the Senate floor vote to confirm Elizabeth Moler as deputy energy secretary had not been set yet. Moler currently chairs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>While Lott said Republicans fell four votes short of the 60 needed to move the broad federal regulatory curbs pushed last year, he said he hoped for another package this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not going to be able to take all these regulations and say okay they're out of here. But at least you have a process where you can contest them, or you can get them altered if they don't even comply with the law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lott also said the five-year balanced budget deal Congress and the White House reached Thursday night almost unravelled because the White House started making &quot;excessive and extremist environmental demands.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the White House wanted a new fund in the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program for orphan shares, or liability of companies that were no longer in existence. That plan had never been considered by Congress, he said.</p>
<p>The White House also &quot;was insisting that we agree to their priorities in energy conservation,&quot; and wanted more money for the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure you petroleum folks understand that solar power will solve all our problems. How much money have we blown on that? This is the hippies' program from the '70s and they're still pushing this stuff,&quot; Lott said.</p>
<p>He called EPA &quot;an agency totally out of control, and they wanted more money for it.&quot;</p>
