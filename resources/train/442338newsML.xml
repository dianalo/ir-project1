<p>The Hungarian government's draft agricultural policy is provoking mixed reactions among farmers, many of whom think the plan is full of &quot;empty phrases&quot;.</p>
<p>The policy made front-page news in Hungary's major dailies on Friday following an open debate between farmers and Agriculture Minister Frigyes Nagy at Hungary's biggest agricultural university outside Budapest on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;This debate does not replace roundtable talks about the state of agriculture,&quot; Jozsef Solymosi, head of a farmers' union, said as the government opened national debate on its long-term farming policy at the university in Godollo.</p>
<p>Opposition parties and farmers' unions have called for a national agricultural debate but the government is hoping its openness to make changes to the draft will defuse the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Bills and policies should be discussed ahead of passing them with those concerned,&quot; Nagy said. &quot;...The government is open to any kind of constructive suggestions.&quot;</p>
<p>But the government is facing an uphill battle with some farmers who say the proposal is too sketchy and a comprehensive farming policy should contain detailed plans for development of Hungary's regions and sectors of the agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;Farmers can no longer be misled by empty phrases and promises,&quot; farmer Andras Kalocsai said during the debate in Godollo, which lasted into the late evening hours. Miklos Csikai, president of the Hungarian Chamber of Agriculture, also said the plan has few concrete components and even some of those are based on misjudgments.</p>
<p>Nagy, the fifth person to head the agriculture ministry in the last six years, defended his plan, saying it was deliberately general in nature and the nationwide debate was supposed to fill it with content.</p>
<p>Nagy was given his present position by Prime Minister Gyula Horn last December, mainly to prepare Hungary's battered agricultural sector for European Union membership. Membership talks begin early next year.</p>
<p>Nagy plans to eventually turn the policy guidelines into law, but opposition politicians and some farmers' representatives disagree with the idea.</p>
<p>&quot;The agricultural law should give the framework to be filled with a policy and not the other way around,&quot; said opposition politician Geza Gyimothy, Deputy Chairman of the parliament's agricultural committee.</p>
