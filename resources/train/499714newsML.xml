<p>Hong Kong, the city that prospered by living off its wits, should remain competitive well into the future despite a welter of outstanding challenges, the authors of a new book said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong faces a number of challenges, including rising costs and competition from other regional centres, and - of course - the transition to Chinese rule, but the intrinsic strength of the Hong Kong economy makes it robust even to fairly major shocks,&quot; Michael Enright, one of three authors of &quot;The Hong Kong Advantage&quot; told a news conference.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's history of prospering despite the odds combined with a harmonious balance between business and government, local and overseas firms, management and enterprise should ensure a strong future, said joint author Edith Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;Our research identified several reasons why Hong Kong has been and is likely to remain the world's quintessential business city,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong prospered in part by keeping its economy open, allowing information to flow freely and letting markets rather than bureaucrats set the tone, Enright said.</p>
<p>The result is a teeming metropolis marked by ingenuity and a can-do business attitude, where many entrepreneurs count pagers and cellular telephones as their only fixed assets.</p>
<p>But the picture is changing.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's willingness to seize opportunity and adapt its capabilities to exploit those opportunities bode well for the future, Enright said.</p>
<p>However, Hong Kong's population of 6.4 million residents is increasingly geographically stable, implying more home-grown brands and a much greater investment in fixed assets.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's tradeable economy also accounts for a smaller proportion of the territory's overall economy.</p>
<p>Services now make up for a rising 80 percent of gross domestic product while manufacturing has slumped to nine percent of GDP from 23 percent over the past decade, said joint author David Dodwell, a director at Jardine Fleming.</p>
<p>This shift is forcing a number of monopolies and oligopolies in the territory's non-traded economy - such as telecommunications companies - to open up to competition.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past, Hong Kong was so much more competitive it could live with these inefficiencies...(but) if Hong Kong's non-traded economy does not liberalise faster, does not become more competitive, it will be at the peril of the economy,&quot; Dodwell warned.</p>
<p>The risk that the transition to Chinese rule does not go smoothly ranks first as the greatest near-term risk to the territory's competitiveness, Enright said.</p>
<p>External challenges, such as the risk that the United States fails to renew China's Most Favoured Nation status, a series of trading perks that boost Sino-U.S. trade routed through Hong Kong, also pose a threat.</p>
<p>But Enright said educating the future workforce could soon become the greatest &quot;constraint&quot; to Hong Kong's economy. The territory's workforce is becoming younger and less transient and will require aggressive training, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't call it a threat. I would call it a constraint over the medium term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong also faces mounting competition from other centres such as Singapore and Taiwan, which have actively targetted multinationals and industries in which Hong Kong held an edge.</p>
