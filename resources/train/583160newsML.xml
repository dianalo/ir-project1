<p>The Indian rupee ended Wednesday at 35.82/825, up from Tuesday's 35.83/84 after a day of dull, range-bound trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the rupee traded on Wednesday at a high of 35.82 and a low of 35.835 with stray deals at 35.8375.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a pretty dull day,&quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank. &quot;The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was not in the spot market, there was little demand and the rupee drifted up slowly through the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said excess dollar supply continued to put pressure on the rupee to appreciate.</p>
<p>The rupee has been buoyant against the US currency in recent months and only RBI dollar purchases have kept it from appreciating.</p>
<p>Dealers said the RBI bought May-delivery dollars outright in the forward market.</p>
<p>&quot;But they (RBI) did not buy much,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;They hit the market briefly in late afternoon buying at rates which work out to 35.86.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said forward premiums moved up in late trade, in response to RBI purchases but ended at Tuesday's closing levels.</p>
<p>The annualised premium for six-month dollars ended Wednesday at 4.4.41 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's close.</p>
