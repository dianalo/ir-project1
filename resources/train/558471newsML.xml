<p>An advisory board to President Boris Yeltsin has warned that Russia is facing a severe demographic crisis caused by a rising death rate and a falling birth rate, Interfax news agency said on Sunday.</p>
<p>It quoted a report by a special presidential commission as saying that between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s Russia's demographic indicators have plummeted from the levels of a developed country to third world levels.</p>
<p>The commission on the problems of women, family and demography said in the report that 2.2 million people died in Russia in 1995 compared with 1.4 million in 1989.</p>
<p>At the same time only 1.4 million were born in 1995 compared with 2.2 million in 1989. The report said that in 1996 the rise in the death rate and the fall in the birth rate in the country of 147 million people had continued.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of the report is to inform the president and other top officials about the unprecedented rise in the death rate in the 1990s,&quot; Interfax quoted the report as saying.</p>
<p>The document said that in 1995 Russia's death rate was higher than in any European or American country and higher than in most Asian and African states whereas in late 1989 Russia was on an average European level.</p>
<p>The report said that more than half of the deaths in Russia were caused by circulatory diseases. Accidents, poisoning and trauma were the second biggest killer followed by cancer.</p>
<p>Medical experts have said that worsening demographic situation in post-Soviet Russia has been prompted by a general decline in the living standards caused by economic crisis as well as by the general collapse of the national health care system.</p>
