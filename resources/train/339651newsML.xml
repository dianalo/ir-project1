<p>A hard-hitting anti-sectarianism television advertising campaign in Northern Ireland drawing parallels with pre-war persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany is being considered by the British government.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said there had been &quot;a sharp downturn&quot; in the mood in the province and there was now a valid comparison to be made between recent church burnings in Northern Ireland and pre-war Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people will say, Oh, that's shocking. Oh, it's alarmist, it's extremist. We haven't got as far as that yet,&quot; Mayhew told BBC2's Newsnight.</p>
<p>&quot;No, we haven't got as far as that, but I wonder how many people have in their mind the unspoken word, 'yet,' &quot; he added.</p>
<p>A government spokeswoman in Belfast said no final decision on the television advertising campaign has been made.</p>
<p>&quot;The concept is only being considered,&quot; the spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday. &quot;No decision has been taken to proceed to production.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, we've been doing advertising for many years,&quot; she added. &quot;The creative ideas involved in this particular one would be designed to make people pause and think...It would be intended to provoke debate about the issues they portray.&quot;</p>
<p>A television advertising campaign that pre-dates the cease fire continues to be broadcast in Northern Ireland. The government definitely plans to run new television adverts, but no decision has been made on just what those ads will be, the spokeswoman said.</p>
