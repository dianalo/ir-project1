<p>Japan was the only major government bond market to turn in a positive return in a week dominated by speculation over U.S. interest rates and European currency union, data from Salomon Brothers showed.</p>
<p>Japanese bonds posted a 0.21 percent increase in yen in the week to March 19 but the Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index dropped 0.54 percent in local currency terms terms.</p>
<p>News the Japanese government would speed up its fiscal reforms, cutting state debt to three percent of GDP by 2003 instead of 2005, buoyed yen bonds but most investors were fixated on the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speculation has grown that the Fed would act pre-emptively to nip inflation in the bud and raise rates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, European bond markets were knocked after Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher said he doubted whether Germany would meet the three percent deficit-to-debt ratio required for joining European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>The remarks fuelled market talk the whole EMU project would be delayed and hit high yielding markets as well as the core.</p>
<p>Swedish government bonds, took the worst beating, dropping to the bottom of the index with a 2.13 percent decline in crown terms while Spanish bonds fell 0.76 percenct and Italian bonds 0.31 percent.</p>
<p>Danish bonds were the second worse performers, pulling down investors' returns by 1.55 percent in crown terms, even though Denmark has opted out of EMU.</p>
<p>Austrian bonds were off 0.52 percent, Belgian bonds fell 1.02 percent and the Netherlands slithered 0.84 percent lower.</p>
<p>Analysts said EMU tremors have been hitting the core and safe haven Germany because of the longer term fiscal and political ramifications of a delay.</p>
<p>Bunds fell 0.78 percent in the week in mark terms while French bonds were off 1.05 percent.</p>
<p>British gilts were also big losers in the week, falling 1.42 percent in sterling terms after Prime Minister John Major announced an election for May 1.</p>
<p>Among the dollar bloc, Canadian bonds fell 0.63 percent, U.S. Treasuries fell 0.47 percent and Australian bonds 0.23 percent, making them the second best performers.</p>
<p>In dollar terms, Swedish bonds were also the worst performers, falling 1.99 percent while Swiss bonds were the top dollar performers with gains of 0.94 percent.</p>
<p>Salomon's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity, weighted for market capitalisation. Only bonds freely available to institutional investors and with a certain minimum amount outstanding are included. Returns take account of price moves and accrued interest.</p>
