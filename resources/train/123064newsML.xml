<p>The Department of Trade and Industry was clamping down on illegal imports of poor quality gambling machines, Minister Alec Erwin said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a reply to a question in the Senate, Erwin said that it was clear that South Africa had become a dumping ground for illegal and inferior quality gambling machines.</p>
<p>In one case a gambling machine had been found to have been &quot;manipulated in such a manner that the percentage return to player pay-out was reduced drastically,&quot; Erwin said.</p>
<p>He said the machines were coming from various countries but that the customs and excise department said that no machines had been confiscated since January 1996.</p>
<p>Erwin said media reports indicated there were about 40,000 illegal gambling machines operating in South Africa &quot;and according to other informed sources these figures might even be as high as 100,000&quot;.</p>
<p>Import permits were only granted to legal casino operators or for demonstration persons.</p>
<p>Since July, the department had intensified efforts to prevent further imports of illegal machines and &quot;significant successes had already been achieved,&quot; Erwin said.</p>
<p>A task force was being set up to concentrate on this &quot;to ensure that illegal gambling machines and operators are eradicated countrywide&quot;.</p>
<p>This would be done before the establishment of a gambling inspectorate.</p>
