<headline>U.S. says work needed for NATO deal with Russia.</headline>

<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov held pre-summit talks with President Bill Clinton on Monday but U.S. officials said a deal over NATO expansion still seemed some way off.</p>
<p>Primakov told reporters after the hour-long White House meeting that Russia would not change its opposition to NATO's plan to accept new members from Eastern Europe, but he signalled that Moscow wanted an accommodation.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia understands that NATO is a real force, and Russia wants to have normal relations with NATO, which would serve the cause of normalising the situation in Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Primakov and Clinton had a &quot;good review&quot; of the issues to be addressed at the Helsinki summit on March 20-21 between Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>The NATO expansion plan, to be unveiled in Madrid in July, was expected to dominate the summit, but arms control and Moscow's desire to join international economic groupings will also be on the agenda.</p>
<p>To allay Moscow's concerns over the entry of its former allies into the Western alliance, NATO is offering Russia a charter that would give it the right to close consultation on European security issues but no power to veto NATO plans.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously we have not reached an agreement on the NATO-Russia charter,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said, commenting on three rounds of talks Primakov has held since Saturday with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of work that needs to be done before we have a charter agreement, to say the least,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>McCurry told reporters: &quot;There will likely continue to be some disagreements after the summit in Helsinki. I can't imagine that we will solve all the issues that are pending.&quot;</p>
<p>Primakov said both sides had put forward proposals during his Washington talks. &quot;We compared our proposals. We worked hard. And in some cases we achieved success,&quot; he said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Primakov corrected a Russian questioner who asked about the &quot;juridical basis&quot; that Moscow has been seeking for an agreement with NATO. The West has rejected the notion that such a deal should have the force of international law.</p>
<p>&quot;I would put it more precisely in this respect,&quot; Primakov said. &quot;What we are talking about is the binding character of the document. I have the impression that the American side understands our arguments in favour of the binding character of the document.&quot;</p>
<p>McCurry noted that a politically binding agreement would simply mean a commitment that the United States and its allies would carry out.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say there is an element of bargaining in the Russian position, with Moscow holding out for concessions in other fields in return for accepting a NATO expansion plan they know the alliance is determined to pursue.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russians are going to soak this for everything they can, and we know that,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>As a &quot;sweetener&quot; for NATO expansion, the West is offering Russia changes to the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe pact that would block an arms buildup around Russia's borders.</p>
<p>Of even more concern to Washington is to try to break a deadlock over nuclear arms control. The 1993 START-2 strategic arms pact is stuck in the Russian Duma (parliament), many of whose deputies fear it could hurt Russian security.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have spoken of preparing for a possible START-3 accord that would go beyond the major missile cutbacks envisioned in START-2. But they say negotiations cannot start until the Duma ratifies the earlier treaty.</p>
<p>One carrot that the United States can offer Moscow is support for its membership in global economic groupings like the World Trade Organisation and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>
