<p>Checkers Drive-In Restaurants Inc said Friday it expected a net loss from operations of about $8.8 million for its fiscal fourth quarter, based on a preliminary review of results for the 16-week period ending December 30.  </p>
<p>Soft sales, accompanied by a further deterioration in restaurant margins, have contributed to the fourth quarter loss, it said.</p>
<p>The company said the preliminary results did not include any possible fourth-quarter adjustments for such items as additional FAS-121 writedowns, restaurant closures, severances and relocations.</p>
<p>It said it had reduced the number of personnel at its Clearwaer corporate and modular manufacturing locations by about 20 percent as part of a management's program to reduce costs.</p>
<p>The company said it had promoted Joe Stein as chief financial officer in addition to his role as executive vice president and chief administrative officer.</p>
<p>Checkers also said it was continuing to work with CKE Restaurants Inc and other investors regarding their participation in the investment of some $20 million in Checkers through the purchase of Checkers stock in a previously announced private placement.</p>
<p>The placement is is expected to be completed within the next 30 days, it said.</p>
<p>Checkers Drive-In Restaurants Inc, along with its franchisees, operates about 500 double drive-thru restaurants primarily located in the Southeast.</p>
