<p>Lloyds Chemists Plc has found buyers for its pharmaceutical wholesaling businesses, clearing the way for takeover bids from suitors Gehe AG and UniChem Plc, British newspapers reported on Monday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Lloyds Chemists was unavailable for comment on Monday, which was a public holiday in Britain.</p>
<p>The Financial Times said Lloyds had told both UniChem and Gehe on Friday that it had secured agreements in principle for the sale of up to seven warehousing depots, fulfilling government conditions for the bids to proceed.</p>
<p>The newspaper also quoted Lloyds' advisers, HSBC Samuel Montagu, as saying the company remained as valuable now as four months ago. This was despite a profit warning from Lloyds last month.</p>
<p>&quot;There have obviously been attempts to talk down the value of Lloyds. But although its historic profits have been adversely affected by the distraction of the bid, there has been no change to the value of the business going forward. It is certainly as valuable now as it was four months ago,&quot; the FT reported the advisers as saying.</p>
<p>The Times reported that Lloyds said it had received &quot;numerous&quot; offers from prospective buyers of the wholesaling business, which has depots at Cambridge, Carlisle, Coulsdon, Derby, Glasgo, York and Belfast.</p>
<p>The Times said Lloyds said it had forwarded signed heads of terms to UniChem and Gehe.</p>
<p>Gehe has an increased cash offer of 500p a share, valuing Lloyds at 650 million stg, which matches UniChem's offer of cash and shares. The Times said UniChem has built up an interest of 9.9 percent in Lloyds, whose shares closed at 491p on Friday.</p>
