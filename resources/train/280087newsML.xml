<p>Germany on Tuesday denied interfering in another country's affairs after Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel angered British politicians by urging Britain to commit itself more closely to the European Union.</p>
<p>Kinkel used his New Year message to warn Britain it must choose whether it wanted closer integration with Europe.</p>
<p>His remarks were interpreted in Britain as unwelcome interference from abroad, but a spokesman for the German minister said Kinkel's statement was an expression of goodwill. The spokesman also said the idea of interference in another country's affairs was less and less relevant in a growing political union.</p>
<p>&quot;In a European Union which aspires to become a political union, interference in internal affairs is by definition hardly possible,&quot; spokesman Martin Erdmann told a news conference. &quot;But even if it were possible, it is certainly not intended.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain must hold a general election by next May and Europe is a key issue for Prime Minister John Major's Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party, which is a good 20 points ahead in most opinion polls.</p>
<p>&quot;The country must reach a clear decision on its European policy. Britain belongs to Europe. Europe needs Britain,&quot; Kinkel said in his message.</p>
<p>Alistair Darling, Labour's finance spokesman, said: &quot;It is up to the British people to choose their next government.</p>
<p>Darling's comments were echoed by Paddy Ashdown, leader of the minority Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Klaus Kinkel's comments are unhelpful and almost certainly unwise. The British people are perfectly capable of making up their own minds,&quot; Ashdown said. Former Conservative prime minister Sir Edward Heath, who took Britain into Europe in 1972, said Kinkel's remarks reflected frustration over Britain's hesitancy over Europe.</p>
<p>Conservative Party chairman Brian Mawhinney sought to turn Kinkel's comments to his own electoral advantage.</p>
<p>Britons must decide, he said, if they want to elect Major, who would &quot;defend British interests&quot; in Europe, or Labour Leader Tony Blair, who would &quot;do what the other European leaders tell him&quot;.</p>
<p>Kinkel insisted that the planned single currency -- one of the most controversial aspects of EU membership for Britain -- would happen and that preparations would continue through 1997.</p>
<p>He also called for renewed efforts to ensure the success of efforts to streamline EU decision-making and reduce individual countries' veto powers -- another source of irritation to British &quot;Euro-sceptics&quot;.</p>
<p>Labour's foreign affairs spokesman Robin Cook rejected Kinkel's suggestion that a firm commitment should be made to the single currency now.</p>
<p>&quot;We have stressed that a Labour government could only join a single currency with the consent of the British people,&quot; he said.</p>
