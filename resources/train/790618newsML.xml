<p>A top figure in Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) said his colleagues would probably lose new elections, and the centre-left Social Democrats would inevitably govern.</p>
<p>ODS vice-chairman Miroslav Macek, a potential successor to Klaus in the party, said in an interview with the weekly Tyden published on Monday that he was &quot;sceptical&quot; the coalition government could survive until scheduled elections in 2000.</p>
<p>He said that in the face of recent economic problems, the ODS still had to push through &quot;necessary&quot; measures such as the fast privatisation of large banks and companies and steps for &quot;a solidification of the whole economic environment&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Nonetheless, if these measures are consequently executed, the ODS, with high probability, will lose the next election,&quot; Macek told Tyden, adding that the results would, however, form the basis for the party's success in a later election.</p>
<p>Support for the ODS, which unabashedly claims to follow the politics of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, has dropped to around 20 percent in recent opinion polls, after topping 1996 elections with just under 30 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>The largest opposition party the Social Democrats (CSSD), who stripped the governing three-party coalition of its majority in parliament with a surprising 26 percent in last year's elections, has grown steadily to 28 percent support.</p>
<p>Many Czechs have become disillusioned with the government after poor economic results in the spring and a subsequent sharp drop of the Czech crown, which led Klaus to admit that mistakes were made in the post-communist transformation.</p>
<p>When asked if the coalition, the longest-surviving reformist government in post-Communist Europe, was heading for a collapse soon, Macek said the ruling parties &quot;might&quot; agree on resolutions to present problems and survive until 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;But personally, I am sceptical,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The coalition is split on key issues, Macek said, with the ODS and its right-wing partner the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODS) on one side, and the centrist Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL) on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Finding a compromise solution will be problematic, if not impossible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government has initiated tough austerity measures such as budget cuts and wage freezes to dampen domestic demand which has caused the current account deficit to balloon, but a huge fight over the 1998 budget is expected this autumn.</p>
<p>Many analyts expect the situation to benefit the Social Democrats, who said they would like early elections in 1998. The Christian Democrats, meanwhile, have made overtures about a possible governing coalition with the CSSD.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a feeling that sooner or later here the Social Democrats will naturally come to power,&quot; Macek told Tyden.</p>
<p>He said Czechs raised their expectations for prosperity too high after the fall of Communism in 1989, and that too much faith had been put in Klaus and the ODS as &quot;saviours&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;People still have one untested possibility which is enticing: They hope they will find the Messiah who will bring about a miracle that they can work like a socialist and live like a capitalist,&quot; Macek said.</p>
<p>He added that the problems in the post-Communist transformation did not from &quot;too much liberalism&quot; but that the changes did not come with clear and enforceable rules.</p>
