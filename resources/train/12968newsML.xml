<p>Russian Alexander Popov, the only man to retain the Olympic 50 and 100 metre freestyle titles, underwent an emergency operation on Sunday after being stabbed on a street in south-west Moscow.</p>
<p>But the smiling 24-year-old told NTV television he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no need to worry. We're going to be walking soon -- and swimming,&quot; he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care ward of Hospital No 31 in the Russian capital.</p>
<p>A senior member of the medical team told ORT television: &quot;We hope that developments after the operation will be normal. We have every reason to believe so.&quot;</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency quoted police as saying that Popov was stabbed in the abdomen around 11 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Saturday after arguing with a group of roadside watermelon sellers.</p>
<p>Popov, who successfully defended the 50 and 100 titles at the Atlanta Olympics, underwent surgery overnight.</p>
<p>Russian swimming federation head Gennady Aleshin said the wound had affected a lung and Popov's kidneys.</p>
<p>No arrests were made and police were still investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Tass said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was outraged by the attack and had ordered the health authorities to ensure the double Olympic champion was given the best possible treatment.</p>
