<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>
<headline>Italian bonds/futures closing report.</headline>

<p>Italian bonds ended down in the wake of a strong showing for French Socialists in the first round of elections but brokers said they were waiting for Tuesday to see the true market assessment.</p>
<p>With both London and U.S. players off on a three-day weekend, volumes were limited but the June Btp future on MIF fell 79 basis points to 129.15.</p>
<p>The February 2007 Btp was 70 basis points lower at 96.57 with the yield at 7.28 percent and the spread over 10-year Bund 135 basis points. The lira dipped early to near to its ERM central parity of 990 per mark before coming back to 986.30.  </p>
<p>&quot;The French elections have brought what is possibly an excessive fall in Btps which can be explained by the thin volume,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>At home, the market is hoping for titbits from a meeting of leaders of parties in the centre-left government this evening who will talk about the three-year economic plan (Dpef) before the document is unveiled at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Expectations for a fall in the 6.75 percent discount rate remain, with some seeing a cut by Friday evening before the Bank of Italy bank holds its annual meeting Saturday. Others expect the central bank to wait until next week.-Milan +392 66129507</p>
