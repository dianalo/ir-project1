<p>General Motors Corp., posting its best North American vehicle profits in a decade, said Monday it earned $1.8 billion from continuing operations in the first quarter, up from strike-crippled year-ago earnings of $800 million.</p>
<p>The March 1996 strike at two GM brake plants in Dayton, Ohio, slashed the year-earlier earnings by $900 million and forced the shutdown of 26 GM assembly plants and numerous components plants.</p>
<p>But GM roared back this year with first-quarter profits equal to $2.30 a share, up from 93 cents in the first quarter of 1996, as its sales grew to $42.26 billion from $39.24 billion.</p>
<p>The 1996 results excluded $219 million in profits from Electronic Data Systems Corp., which GM spun off last year.</p>
<p>The 1997 first-quarter performance exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimates of $2.09 a share.</p>
<p>GM stock rose 62.5 cents to $53.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Leading the way for GM was a $764 million profit from its North American vehicle operations, which compared with a year-earlier loss of $279 million in the first quarter of 1996. GM attributed $750 million of its year-ago strike losses to the North American Operations.</p>
<p>Boiling out the strike impact from year ago results, GM said it managed to boost North American profit margins despite an increase in retail incentives to $860 per vehicle from $598 a year earlier.</p>
<p>GM Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh attributed the gains to material cost savings and manufacturing efficiencies partly due to the launch of new, lower-cost vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;As we go through the year, I expect NAO (North American Operations) to improve their market share, particularly in the second half of the year, and I expect them to continue to have year-to-year profit improvements,&quot; Losh said.</p>
<p>GM's Delphi Automotive Systems parts unit, making its first quarterly report separate from the core automotive results, posted net income of $180 million for the period. The total included an after-tax charge of $50 million for the closing of a parts plant in Trenton, N.J.</p>
<p>Delphi earned a profit of $79 million in the first quarter of 1996, which included a $120 million negative strike impact.</p>
<p>Analysts said the North American results provided an encouraging sign that GM's turnaround is progressing.</p>
<p>&quot;If you get the same market scenario for the next two to three years, GM is in a position to produce record results in 1997 and in 1998 as well,&quot; said PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward.</p>
<p>But GM's European operations struggled under the weight of a fiercely competitive market, with first quarter operating profits falling to $94 million from $285 million a year ago. European incentives rose to $622 per vehicle during the quarter from $598 a year earlier.</p>
<p>The operating results excluded a gain of $55 million from the $1.1 billion settlement in January of GM's industrial espionage dispute with Germany's Volkswagen AG.</p>
<p>Including the gain, GM's International Operations -- which comprise the automaker's European, Latin American and Asia/Pacific operations -- reported net income of $317 million in the latest quarter, compared with earnings of $432 million in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>GM Chairman Jack Smith, speaking to reporters Monday at a business luncheon in Cleveland, said GM was disappointed in the European results, but knew the market would be tough.</p>
<p>&quot;The economies are not strong (in Europe) and we're seeing a lot of price pressure in the marketplace,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>General Motors Acceptance Corp., GM's financing unit, also surprised analysts with a 20.4 percent earnings improvement to $372 million, due partly to capital gains in GMAC's insurance unit.</p>
<p>GM said its worldwide wholesale vehicle sales to dealers rose 11.6 percent in the first quarter to 2.19 million from 1.96 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>GM said its retail vehicle deliveries in the United States in the first quarter of 1997 totalled 1,123,000 units, resulting in a 30.2-percent share of the U.S. market. That compared with 1,152,000 units and a 31.2-percent share in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>GM is the second of Detroit's Big Three to report first quarter earnings. Chrysler Corp. said last week its net income rose 2.4 percent to $1.03 billion, while Ford Motor Co. is due to report its results Wednesday.</p>
