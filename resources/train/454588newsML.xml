<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard, a conservative riding high in the polls after a year in office, called Britain's John Major on Wednesday to wish him luck in May 1 elections expected to end 18 years of Tory rule.</p>
<p>Howard -- a stolid politician not unlike Britain's &quot;grey man prime minister&quot; -- told Major it was a good idea to take part in a public debate with Labour leader Tony Blair, a government spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Major said the economy was in the best shape it had been in 70 years, so they thought that was a message they could sell (to voters),&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Britain's Labour opposition, around 25 percentage points ahead in opinion polls, is widely expected to end the Conservatives' 18-year grip on power.</p>
<p>For most of that period -- from 1983 to 1996 -- Australia was ruled by its own leftist Labor party.</p>
<p>But Howard's Liberal-Nationals crushed Labor last March and now hold 94 of the 147 seats in the lower House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Given that majority, political analysts say Howard's conservative coalition is likely to hold government for six years (two terms) and might easily remain for nine.</p>
