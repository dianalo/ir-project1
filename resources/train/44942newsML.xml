<headline>Charter H2 better but fails to meet hopes.</headline>

<p>UK-based diversified industrial group Charter Plc warned on Tuesday that although the second half of the year had started better than the first, it still failed to meet expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The trading environment will continue to be challenging and much depends on the pace of recovery in European economies,&quot; it said in its results statement.</p>
<p>Charter, which earlier reported a 4.6 percent rise in first half pretax profits to 51.9 million stg on slightly lower sales of 570.3 million stg, also said that it continued to look for acquisition opportunities which would enhance shareholder value.  </p>
<p>&quot;The disposal of Charter's investment in Cape on 18 July concentrates the group's resources on market leading businesses which have the potential to achieve better returns, and enhances Charter's ability to fund future acquisitions,&quot; said Jeffrey Herbert, Charter's chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>Charter's gearing has been eliminated following the sale of its 65.3 percent investment in fire protection products group Cape. The sale produced 47.7 million stg in cash which would be accounted for in the second half of the year, it said.</p>
<p>However, the disposal resulted in effectively no profit or loss before a write-back of goodwill of some 50 million stg.  </p>
<p>Charter's welding products arm saw operating profits for the first half rise 1.0 percent to 40.3 million stg, despite &quot;a difficult market&quot;, especially in Europe.</p>
<p>Southern European countries showed strong performance during the first half, which Charter said it expected to continue, but this was offset by weakness in Scandinavia and Germany.</p>
<p>Esab, the welding products business, saw a solid performance in North America but first half performance in Brazil was lower than in the same period last year, when Brazilian Government initiatives had produced a rapid increase in demand and a period of exceptional performance for the unit, Charter said.</p>
