<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans on Wednesday for a second round of spending cuts to plug Israel's budget deficit but analysts said he faced a battle with his own coalition to push them through.</p>
<p>Netanayahu said he would seek a cut of two billion shekels ($620 million) in addition to the original demand for a 4.9 billion shekel cut sent to legislators last month which they are still haggling over.</p>
<p>Netanyahu and Finance Minister Dan Meridor did not say where the additional cuts would be made but vowed at a joint news conference not to raise taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;We're at a very difficult crossroads,&quot; said Netanyahu, who ousted a Labour-led government in May elections. &quot;We received a difficult legacy from the previous government but how difficult became apparent only in recent days.&quot;</p>
<p>This year's budget is running well in excess of the deficit target as government revenues have fallen behind projections. As a result, Israel's current account deficit is expected to widen to $5 billion this year from $4.1 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very dangerous deficit in the balance of payments, which will grow worse in the next one-to-two years if we don't cut,&quot; Meridor warned.</p>
<p>The government's fiscal policy was given short shrift by some analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;How can the new proposal for cuts be taken seriously while the previous one is being torpedoed mercilessly in parliament?&quot; wrote economic analyst Dov Genachowski in Israel's mass circulation Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's government has approved a 1997 spending package of 190.8 billion shekels, after 4.9 billion shekels in cuts.</p>
<p>But legislators, including members of Netanyahu's Likud-led coalition, have kept the budget proposal locked in a parliamentary committee, arguing that the cuts unfairly target low-income families.</p>
<p>Netanyahu told reporters that Israel could slide into an economic abyss if the cuts did not go through. Lawmakers must approve the budget by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear that he'll have difficulties (getting the cuts approved) but there is still a month-and-a-half left,&quot; said Nehemia Strasler, economics editor of the Haaretz newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;This is always the period when legislators are concerned about their constituents. They give a lot of interviews and make a lot of noise...but every year they fold at the last moment,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Treasury sources said they are considering cuts to the ministries' procurement budgets and social welfare spending. A senior government official said the additional cuts would not affect the defence budget.</p>
<p>The army's recent clashes with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and heightened concerns about war with Syria have made the government reluctant to cut defence spending, which accounts for around 16 percent of the budget.</p>
<p>Despite Netanyahu's promises, economist Jonathan Katz of Solid Capital Market said a compromise may have to be made to impose new taxes on fuel or cigarettes.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said detailed spending cuts would be worked out after November 30, when the latest 1996 revenue figures are in, and a proposal will be given to parliament in early December for approval by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's announcement generated little reaction in the stock and bond markets in Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are now waiting to see what will happen with the budget cuts. It is still to early to predict what the government will do,&quot; said a trader at Bank Leumi.</p>
