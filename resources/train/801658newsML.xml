<p>The Polish assassin who almost derailed South Africa's transition to democracy by shooting communist leader Chris Hani told police he had also hoped to kill Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>According to transcripts of his interrogation, Janusz Walus, who is serving a life sentence for Hani's 1993 murder, told police after his arrest that Mandela topped the list given to him by co-conspirator Clive Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p>White communist party leader Joe Slovo was next on the list and Hani, whose popularity was second only to Mandela, third.</p>
<p>The transcript was released to reporters on Friday at a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing by lawyers for Hani's family, who are opposing amnesty for the killers.</p>
<p>According to the transcript, Walus admitted to police that he shot Hani in the driveway of his home, saying he addressed him by name and, when he answered &quot;Hi&quot;, shot him.</p>
<p>&quot;The first shot hit him in the stomach. He screamed and fell down. It was a scream of fear. He was lying down when I shot him in the head. One shot in the ear and two shots behind the same ear,&quot; Walus told his interrogators.</p>
<p>Walus said security around Mandela, who became South Africa's first black president a year later, was too tight and he could not find Slovo's house.</p>
<p>Hani's assassination almost derailed negotiations between Mandela's ANC and F.W. de Klerk's white government about a transition from apartheid to democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;After I received the list from Clive Derby-Lewis, I started to do recces (reconnaissance). I started with number one on the list, Nelson Mandela, and after I recced his house once, I thought the old goat was not worth it,&quot; he told police.</p>
<p>&quot;Joe Slovo, priority number two on the list, address was not available (sic), and I decided to concentrate on priority number three on the list, Chris Hani.&quot;</p>
<p>Walus said he was unmoved by Hani's death, telling a police officer: &quot;I am the last to cry for him... He was the leader of the communists in this country and I hated him for that.&quot;</p>
<p>The transcript has not previously been released and Walus did not testify at his trial. Lawyers for Walus and Derby-Lewis, who is also serving a life sentence, are contesting the validity of the documents, saying they were made under duress.</p>
<p>Walus alleges he was plied with alcohol by police during questioning and coerced into making statements while drunk.</p>
<p>The three former policemen who took the statements have been subpoenaed to appear before the truth commission next week to answer the accusations.</p>
<p>During Friday's hearing, Derby-Lewis, 61, a far-right Conservative Party politician, urged forgiveness across the political spectrum, saying that South Africans on both sides of the apartheid divide were victims of the past.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be no fingers pointed, only deep sympathy for those bereaved of loved ones and hopefully forgiveness all round,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Derby-Lewis also solicited the help of the truth commission to speak to Hani's widow, Limpho, adding that he had also asked his lawyers to try to set up a meeting.</p>
<p>The convicted pair hope to convince the truth commission, which is probing human rights abuses perpetrated under white rule, that they had a political motive for the crime, that they have confessed in full and that they deserve amnesty.</p>
