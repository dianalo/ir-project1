<p>Cocoa futures remained trapped in tight ranges on Wednesday as light origin selling kept values away from the highs, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been moving in a five pound range -- it's been thin for three days now. We just can't sustain the higher values at the moment,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day there's a bit of origin in the market but the volumes are such the market takes a bit of a hit because there's nothing supporting it,&quot; he said, adding that a weak New York performance was not helping sentiment in London.</p>
<p>At the close the benchmark December contract stood six stg lower at 970 stg after moving between 969 and 975 stg.</p>
<p>Other traded positions were weaker in a light volume of 1,658 lots.</p>
<p>Switch activity was also limited with May/September attracting the most activity, market sources said.</p>
<p>Traders said there was also some market confusion over the various forecasts for the world 1996/97 cocoa deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;The market does not know how to react...There are many forecasts for 1996/97 floating about,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) on Monday forecast a world deficit of 225,000 tonnes, followed promptly on Tuesday by UK research house Landell Mills (LMC) forecasting a deficit of 150,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Both were hot on the heels of U.S. trade house Cargill pegging the 1996/97 deficit at 178,000 tonnes last week.</p>
<p>The market is also awaiting a world 1996/97 balance later this week from British trade house E D &amp; F Man.</p>
<p>But technical analysts said there was still room for world cocoa prices to move to the upside.</p>
<p>&quot;The long term trend in cocoa remains broadly directionless and there are no signs of that changing yet,&quot; said Elli Gifford in Investment Research's latest monthly technical summary.</p>
<p>&quot;...the fact  that the 52-week moving average is rising still hints that the market argument has taken on a bullish bias, suggesting that attempts to clear resistance at the recent highs could, in due course, resume.&quot;</p>
