<p>Russia's riskiest investments, super high-yield unsecured promissory notes, are probably the biggest securities market in the country and are attracting foreign interest, dealers and analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The promissory notes, issued by railways, banks and blue chip firms, are the next best thing to corporate bonds in this emerging market. Yields range from about 25 percent to money-doubling offers that some cannot refuse.</p>
<p>&quot;The vast majority is junk,&quot; said Troika Dialog fixed income chief Robert Devane. &quot;It was a rough and dirty solution to the payments crisis. It was also a way to issue corporate debt.&quot;</p>
<p>Cash-poor companies and banks have used the Veksel promissory notes, with maturities from two to six months, as cash surrogates to avoid bankruptcy over the lean years of Russian economic reform.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts say the market capitalisation in the notes has blossomed to $50-90 billion, compared with a $50 billion domestic government securities department and an $80 billion, though illiquid, stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is a bit dangerous, because a lot of enterprises will never pay,&quot; said Federal Commission for the Securities Market spokesman Yuri Kotler.</p>
<p>There are no figures for default -- and no official figures on the size of the overall veksel market. Traders say payments are often delayed for months.</p>
<p>Devane said the market was on its last legs and would wither away by the end of the year when the non-payments crisis eases and rules for corporate bond issuance are settled.</p>
<p>But he said foreigners were eager to get into the market, and a new fund, Dublin-registered IFCI Securities fund managed by top veksel trader Bank MFK, had just opened.</p>
<p>&quot;There is only about $100 million in portfolio investments, but there is at least three times as much waiting to get in,&quot; Devane said. He said a dozen foreign specialists and their firms controlled another few hundred million dollars worth.</p>
<p>But a Bank MFK official said the market was still growing.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has potential,&quot; said the MFK official, who works with the ICFI fund. It has attracted $15 million in one month and expects to grow to $25 million by the end of June.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, most firms are not ready to issue corporate bonds and the corporate veksel market is growing strongly.&quot;</p>
<p>Estimates vary widely on the size of this market, where the Federal Commission for the Securities Markets regulates trade loosely and almost no one regulates issuance.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think right now we have any working system on the supervision of veksels,&quot; said Commission spokesman Kotler.</p>
<p>Banks avoid Central Bank issue limits by printing paper with maturities of less than three months that never show up on quarterly reports, one trader said.</p>
<p>Short-term notes issued by banks and their subsidiaries are the most trusted notes, yielding as little as about 25 or 26 percent in rouble terms against about 21 percent for longer-yielding domestic government paper.</p>
<p>But major firms also issue promissory notes, which the MFK official said was a 200 trillion roubles ($35 billion) market.</p>
<p>Most of the market is redeemable in kind. Railways give freight and refrigerator companies give refrigerators.</p>
<p>But one market source said top corporate veksels by issuers such as gas group Gazprom could yield 30 percentage points more than bank paper.</p>
<p>Active trading, though dangerous, can drive up yields sharply, said the MFK official, who added the fund would soon begin such operations.</p>
<p>Large organisations can also find veksel issued by subsidiaries of national companies, such as regional branches of Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, which can issue veksels in the name of the corporation, Devane said.</p>
<p>&quot;The greatest differences may be in arbitrage between the regions and Moscow,&quot; said Alexander Klimanov, a fixed income trader at Renaissance Capital investment bank, which is setting up promissory note trading on expectations of foreign interest.</p>
<p>&quot;No one could argue that it is not risky,&quot; said Sergei Ivanov, head of debt securities trading at MFK. &quot;But the rate of return is proportional to the risk.&quot;</p>
