<headline>Conrail - excerpts of U.S. court ruling.</headline>
<dateline>PHILADELPHIA 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following are excerpts from U.S. District Court Judge Donald Van Artsdalen's ruling Thursday on motions brought by Norfolk Southern Corp contesting the planned merger of Conrail Inc and CSX Corp.</p>
<p>In his oral ruling, Van Artsdalen denied a Norfolk Southern request for a preliminary injunction against a two-year &quot;no-shop&quot; provision in the CSX-Conrail merger agreement, which prevents Conrail from considering another offer until the merger contract expires Dec. 31, 1998.</p>
<p>He also rejected Norfolk Southern's argument that Conrail and CSX had triggered Pennsylvania's &quot;fair value&quot; law, which would require CSX to pay cash for all Conrail shares.</p>
<p>And he declined to block a January 17 Conrail shareholders meeting until a final legal decision on the issues could be rendered.</p>
<p>A transcript of the ruling was made available Friday.</p>
<p>Following are some of the remarks in Van Artsdalen's ruling:</p>
<p>-- On the lockout period, which was extended in December to two years from 270 days in a previous Conrail-CSX merger pact  upheld in November by Van Artsdalen:</p>
<p>&quot;As to the...no-shop or lockout period, the arguments that have been made on the present motions are essentially ... a rehash of the arguments which were made at the prior hearing, in which I denied any relief...There is no essential difference, as I see it...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see no principled reason...as to why the lockout could not extend for the full period of the contract (the merger agreement), nor is there any reason to think that any particular line of demarcation need be drawn so far as the facts of the case presently before me are concerned...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(W)here a contract is entered into, it is expected that the parties will act in good faith and will not deliberately go out and attempt to shop the contract...to see if they can get a better deal.&quot;</p>
<p>-- On the Pennsylvania &quot;fair value&quot; law, which requires that a company or group acquiring 20 percent or more of the shares in another firm, in what is called a &quot;control transaction,&quot; must pay equivalent terms for all remaining shares on demand:</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern had argued that the holdings of Conrail's top officers should be counted along with CSX 19.9 percent stake, thus triggering the law, and said CSX's subsequent sales of shares to put even the combined holdings below the limit did not erase the liability.</p>
<p>Van Artsdalen said no control transaction had occurred because the Conrail officials and CSX could not be considered a group:</p>
<p>&quot;It may fully be expected that the (Conrail) board of directors and the officers will continue to support the merger...but there is certainly no evidence that there was any agreement...that the officers and directors as individuals would vote their own shares of stock in locked step with those of CSX...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(To find a control transaction) there does have to be some sort of an agreement, express or implied, and I do not find that the evidence establishes that...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's unlikely that there ever was a control transaction and if there was, it was clearly inadvertant...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And...there was a divesting of a sufficient number of excess shares, so that there would no longer be a control group having more than 20 percent of the stock.&quot;</p>
<p>-- On delaying the shareholder meeting:</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that Norfolk Southern...is seeking in every conceivable way to block this merger from proceeding...there is nothing too wrong about that...</p>
<p>&quot;(H)owever there is no showing on this record that Norfolk Southern as a shareholder (with a small stake in Conrail) would be harmed in any way if the shareholders vote on the proposition to opt-out of the provisions of the Pennsylvaniacorporation law proceeds on January the 17th.&quot;</p>
