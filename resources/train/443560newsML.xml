<p>Lebanon on Friday marked the 19th anniversary of Israel's first invasion of its northern neighbour by calling on Arab states not to normalise ties with the Jewish state until there is comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace.</p>
<p>President Elias Hrawi said Lebanon would guarantee the security of the Lebanon-Israel border, the last active Arab-Israeli frontline, if Israel ended its 19-year occupation in south Lebanon. But, until there was peace, he wanted Arab support against Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect solidarity from the Arab brethren with us to consolidate the march of just and comprehensive peace by activating the resolutions of the last Arab summit in Cairo (in 1996), especially opposing the Israeli practices and stopping the normalisation of ties until peace is achieved,&quot; Hrawi said in a speech for the occasion.</p>
<p>Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians have peace agreements with Israel. But there has been no tangible progress since Lebanon and its ally Syria began talks with Israel in 1991.</p>
<p>Lebanon ground to a halt at noon in protest against Israel's 19-year occupation of south Lebanon. In Beirut and other cities, motorists stopped their cars as shops, banks and public offices observed a five-minute stoppage for the Day of Solidarity with south Lebanon.</p>
<p>Israeli forces first poured into south Lebanon in 1978 after Palestinians staged a wave of cross-frontier raids into Israel. In 1982, Israeli forces invaded again, reaching Beirut, driving most PLO fighters from Lebanon and killing some 20,000 people.</p>
<p>In 1985, Israel withdrew most of its forces but kept some 1,000 soldiers and 3,000-allied Lebanese militiamen holding a 15-km (nine-miles)-deep zone in south Lebanon -- 11 percent of the country's area -- to stop guerrilla raids on northern Israel.</p>
<p>Hrawi questioned Israel's peace intentions, saying the Jewish state continues to bombard villagers in south Lebanon &quot;keeping them in familiarity with death and tragedy&quot;.</p>
<p>He denounced Thursday's killing of seven Israeli schoolgirls on the Israeli-Jordanian border by a Jordanian soldier but suggested the world had not shown the same concern with Israel's killing of civilians in south Lebanon in 1996.</p>
<p>Last April, in its heaviest campaign against Lebanon since the 1982 invasion, Israeli air, land and sea forces unleashed 17 days of bombardment, killing 200 people, mostly civilians, and causing extensive damage.</p>
<p>During Friday's stoppage, state-run television showed the carnage from that Israeli onslaught against the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God), which leads the guerrilla war to oust the Israelis.</p>
<p>Hizbollah supporters collected donations for their struggle while university students and militants burned Israeli flags. Parliament held a special session attended by Arab and Western diplomats during which MPs denounced the Israeli occupation.</p>
<p>Thousands of Lebanese wore yellow ribbons bearing the number 425 -- support for implementation of the 1978 Security Council Resolution 425 that called for an unconditional Israeli pullout from south Lebanon.</p>
<p>The south Lebanon front was quiet on Friday apart from an attack by guerrillas of the Shi'ite Moslem Amal Movement on a pro-Israeli militia post on the edge of the Israeli-held zone, security sources said. No one was hurt.</p>
