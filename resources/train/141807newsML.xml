<headline>France's CDR says in no hurry in selling AOM.</headline>

<p>The state-owned Consortium de Realisation (CDR), charged with selling assets of bank Credit Lyonnais, said it was in no hurry to sell French regional airline AOM.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the CDR confirmed that there had been informal contacts with Nouvelles Frontieres chairman Jacques Maillot but no formal sale procedure had been started.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had informal contacts,&quot; Jean-Michel Raingeard, spokesman at the CDR told Reuters. &quot;But we have not started a sale procedure, which is a very strict procedure,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said that while the CDR wanted to sell AOM, it was in no hurry.</p>
<p>CDR has 99 percent in AOM.</p>
<p>&quot;The financial situation at AOM is better than at many other airlines,&quot; he said. CDR would only decide to start a sale procedure for AOM &quot;When we feel that the time is ripe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We always planned to sell AOM at the time of the liberalisation of French airspace (in 1997),&quot; Raingeard said.</p>
<p>&quot;What we need now is a period of calm. A lot has happened recently and at a quick pace. We need to wait at least a few weeks to see the new lie of the land,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be cautious,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Raingeard did not comment on whether other parties had made informal contact with CDR on AOM but he said that the CDR had &quot;very many informal contacts on a wide range of issues&quot;.</p>
<p>Industry sources noted that Air France could also be interested in acquiring AOM, if not to strengthen its feeder lines then to prevent other companies from scooping up AOM.</p>
<p>&quot;Air France is under obligation by (the European Commission in) Brussels not to make any acquisitions until full liberalisation. That is part of the Commission's conditions on approval for the (state) capital injection,&quot; an industry executive said.</p>
<p>&quot;Air France also needs to be able to afford an acquisition but the company is on its way to break-even this year (ending March 31, 1997) after eight billion francs in losses. The group is in the process of going from a transition phase to a phase of development,&quot; she added.</p>
