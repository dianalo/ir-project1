<headline>LIFFE cocoa down in holiday-thinned trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-15</dateline>

<p>LIFFE cocoa trading volumes hit their lowest level in months in the morning session as Ivory Coast and many European markets closed for the Assumption Day holiday.</p>
<p>Prices also fell back.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the worst volume in several months,&quot; a trader said as only 413 lots were traded in the session.</p>
<p>September opened seven stg down at 1,007 after New York ended moderately lower overnight in quiet trade, but edged upwards to close five stg down at 1,009.</p>
<p>Active December was four down at 1,039 stg. The back months were between four and eight stg down apart from May and September 1998 which were not traded.</p>
<p>&quot;With cable at 59 we should be four down and we are four down,&quot; a trader said. &quot;There's no feature at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Sterling see-sawed at mid-day in Europe in a holiday-thinned market, making early gains against the dollar but meeting resistance at $1.60 and falling back to $1.5975.</p>
<p>Traders saw no new elements likely to stimulate the market in the short term.</p>
