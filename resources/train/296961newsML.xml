<title>USA: Safeway boosts purchase of shares from KKR.</title>
<headline>Safeway boosts purchase of shares from KKR.</headline>
<dateline>PLEASANTON, Calif. 1997-01-09</dateline>

<p>Safeway Inc said it agreed to increase from 15 million to 32 million the number of shares of Safeway common stock it will buy from partnerships controlled by affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The shares would be purchased at $43 per share immediately after completion of Safeway's acquisition of Vons Cos Inc. The repurchase would limit the increase of outstanding shares of Safeway after the transactions to nine million shares.</p>
<p>Safeway stock rose 7/8 to 44-3/4.  </p>
<p>Safeway also said the repurchase should significantly improve the earnings per share generated from the merger. &quot;We have modified the repurchase transaction in a way that makes the Vons merger even more attractive for all of the shareholders of Safeway and Vons,&quot; said Steve Burd, president and chief executive officer of Safeway.</p>
<p>On December 16, 1996, Safeway and Vons announced a definitive merger agreement under which Safeway would issue 1.425 shares of Safeway common stock, about 41 million shares, for each Vons share Safeway does not currently own.  </p>
<p>When the deal was announced, Safeway said it would buy 15 million shares from KKR affiliates at an undetermined price in order to enhance the value for shareholders.</p>
<p>Safeway said the new agreement has the advantage of fixing a purchase price for the repurchase.</p>
<p>&quot;We view the repurchase as a way of enhancing the value of KKR's continuing substantial investment in Safeway while also providing enhanced liquidity to our investors,&quot; said James Greene, a general partner of KKR Associates.  After the repurchase, KKR partnerships would own more than 33 percent of the outstanding shares, with a value exceeding $3.3 billion.</p>
