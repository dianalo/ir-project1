<p>Favourable July consumer prices data have brought Portugal within reach of the inflation target for entry to Europe's monetary union, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The National Statistics Institute (INE) reported on Thursday that the consumer price index (CPI) was unchanged in July, compared with June, while the year-on-year rise slowed to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent.</p>
<p>More importantly for Portugal's chances of qualifying for economic and monetary union (EMU), the 12-month rolling average, the government's EMU benchmark, slowed to 2.7 percent from 2.9 percent in June.</p>
<p>Analysts said the average rate should dip further in August to 2.5 percent, the upper limit of the government's 2.25-2.5 percent target for 1997, and widely seen as good enough to qualify for EMU membership.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty, the monetary union blueprint, says that inflation in candidate countries cannot be more than 1.5 percentage points above the average of the three best performing countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The average CPI in August, if only for statistical reasons, is going to fall sharply in August to 2.5 percent,&quot; said Banco Santander de Negocios economist Pedro Braz Teixeira.</p>
<p>Most analysts said the July figures guaranteed the government would hit its 1997 target.</p>
<p>&quot;In August, the goal will be reached and by the end of the year we could even be below it,&quot; said Braz Teixeira.</p>
<p>Banco Finatia economist Isabel Costa predicted the average rate would drop to 2.1 or 2.2 percent by the end of the year if the index continued to perform well over the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Analysts said July was the last month in which year-on-year inflation would benefit from the statistical impact of the sharp meat price rises of 1996 -- triggered by the so called &quot;madcow&quot; scare.</p>
<p>But even if the year-on-year rate did not fall further, the average rate would continue to decline, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The year-on-year rate will fluctuate up to the end of the year around current levels,&quot; Braz Teixeira said. &quot;But the average rate will drop sharply in August and continue to decline.&quot;</p>
<p>Local financial markets showed scant reaction to the latest CPI data.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said despite the fact that the numbers had been at the better end of forecasts, they were not seen triggering any near-term interest rate cuts by the Bank of Portugal.</p>
<p>Analysts said the central bank would probably wait another month before reducing its repurchase pact rate further following its 30 basis point cut to 5.7 percent on July 14.</p>
<p>In part, this reflected recent volatility on the currency market where the weakness of the mark had stirred fears of a German rate rise, they said.</p>
