<p>The French government stepped in to a truckers dispute on Sunday, naming a mediator for a new round of talks on seven-day blockades of many towns and petrol depots across the country.</p>
<p>Unions urged truckers, pressing for shorter working hours, wage hikes and retirement at 55 instead of 60, to hold fast in a protest which echoes a damaging 24-day rail strike a year ago which sent Prime Minister Alain Juppe's popularity plummeting.</p>
<p>After the third round of talks failed late on Saturday, Transport Minister Bernard Pons named ministry official Roger Cros, who chaired previous talks, as mediator.</p>
<p>Until last year Cros presided a national conciliation commission set up after the last trucker's conflict in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;Cros's mandate is to obtain a balanced accord between the parties given the unions' grievances and the economic situation of haulage companies,&quot; the ministry said in a statement, adding that he would draw up a talks agenda after seeing both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;The State is determined to do its share to reach an accord,&quot; the ministry said. The government has agreed to help fund retirement at 55, according to unions.</p>
<p>Negotiations will resume at five p.m. (1600 GMT).</p>
<p>Unions, whom Pons met late on Saturday, had welcomed the mediator proposal but several threatened to harden the protest, which is weighing on the economy, if the mediator failed to obtain quick results.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is progress on Sunday, we don't rule out the possibility of spreading the movement to (school and other bus services),&quot; Claude Debons of the pro-Socialist CFDT union said.</p>
<p>Debons told reporters he was not certain the mediator would be able to engineer a rapid solution because the haulage bosses were refusing to make concessions.</p>
<p>CFDT leader Nicole Notat has called a truckers' rally in Paris on Monday if talks failed to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>The Force Ouvriere union was more optimistic, saying that Pons was willing to help fund retirement at 55 but only as part of a general agreement solving the dispute.</p>
<p>The haulage companies said in a statement they had made as many concessions as they could, including retirement at 55 and full payment of all working hours, including time spent loading.</p>
<p>Socialist former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius said the strike was typical of France's unease. &quot;The French are crushed by taxes, unemployment and by a feeling that the government despises them and says 'I have the solution, you don't understand anything,&quot; he told France-2 television.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of trucks blocked main roads around 30 cities and a dozen fuel depots. Some blockades were eased but unions said this was only to give strikers a weekend break, and the screw would be tightened once again from later on Sunday.</p>
<p>The southwest, parts of the south and Normandy were all badly hit. Petrol stations have run out of fuel in areas of Normandy and the south-west around Bordeaux, the city where Juppe is mayor and singled out for the toughest protests.</p>
<p>&quot;People are panicking, they're rushing to fill up their cars. Some are piling up jerrycans in their cars,&quot; said a petrol station owner in Marseille. But in other areas including the north and the Paris region there was little risk of shortages.</p>
<p>Several dozen truckers have blocked a motorway close to Paris's wholesale food market at Rungis but unions said they did not plan to seal off the market which handles two million tonnes of food supplies a day.</p>
<p>On the ring-road around Caen in Normandy, two people died and four were injured on Saturday evening when a car rammed a lorry which had been blockading the motorway. Police said the car had apparently skirted barriers sealing the road off.</p>
