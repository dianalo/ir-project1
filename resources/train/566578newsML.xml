<p>Millfeed prices were mostly steady to lower on Wednesday amid continued slow activity except for some demand for nearby supplies, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a quiet market and not much is going on,&quot; a Buffalo broker said. &quot;We continue to see markets around Buffalo precede us on the way down.&quot; But he said the Buffalo market was steady with no change in the supply and demand scenario.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is expected to stay steady for at least three to four weeks,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Several dealers noted pricing for the spot position.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Wednesday, so there will be some spot orders for this week and next week,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>A Chattanooga broker added there appeared to be some nearby truck demand for midds in the southeast.</p>
<p>But overall, activity was limited. &quot;It's pretty much a flat market now through the summer,&quot; a Kansas dealer said. &quot;We're either going to need some feed demand to show up to push the market higher, or decreases in flour mill runtimes, that kind ofthing.&quot;</p>
