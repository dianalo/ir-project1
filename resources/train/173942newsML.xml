<headline>&quot;Medical Marijuana&quot; measure stirs heated reaction.</headline>

<p>Lawmakers in California on Wednesday said they were taking steps to insure the ballot measure voters approved legalising marijuana for medical uses would not lead to non-medicinal abuses of the drug.</p>
<p>They also said they were likely to challenge the measure in court since it conflicted with federal anti-drug laws that still ban marijuana for medical and recreational purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have a very confused legal situation here,&quot; California Attorney General Dan Lungren said. &quot;Now doctors are in a situation where if they recommend it they are going to be in violation of federal law. What if there is a 10- or 12-year-old who claims marijuana relieves stress? What if prisoners sue for their right to smoke it?&quot;</p>
<p>The controversial measure received 56 percent of the vote in California, a centre of the counter-culture revolution of the sixties where many voters are middle-aged baby boomers who experimented with drugs in their youth.</p>
<p>Arizona voters approved a similar medical marijuana measure on Tuesday by nearly a two-to-one margin.</p>
<p>Under the California measure, doctors who recommend marijuana for a medical treatment and their patients who smoke as part of their treatment will be protected from prosecution.</p>
<p>But it does not say doctors may write prescriptions for marijuana since that would directly conflict with federal law. Since the measure also does not list which medical conditions may legally be treated with marijuana, or guidelines on appropriate doses, several legal questions remained over how it would be enforced.</p>
<p>Lungren said his office was considering legislative steps to prevent unintended loopholes allowing for increased recreational use. He also issued guidelines advising police making arrests for marijuana possession to take note of &quot;the presence of weapons, scanners or the use of evasive tactics&quot; that would help distinguish people using the drug illegally from those who were taking it on the advice of their doctors.</p>
<p>&quot;We're calling it a medical necessity defence bill,&quot; explained Scott Imler, president of the Los Angeles Cannibas Buyers Club, which led the campaign to pass Proposition 215, &quot;The Medical Marijuana Initiative.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What it means is that if someone is arrested and their medicine seized, they can get the charges dropped as long as they can provide a written or oral recommendation from a doctor,&quot; Imler said.</p>
<p>He became involved in the movement after a ski accident left him with a seizure disorder and he found that marijuana alleviated his symptoms with fewer side effects than valium and other medication his doctors had prescribed.</p>
<p>Most members of the Cannibas Buyers Club are AIDS sufferers, who have doctors notes suggesting they smoke pot for their pain. Other members suffer from illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, cancer, glaucoma and chronic migraine. The membership ranges in age from 21 to 87.</p>
<p>Despite some studies that show marijuana reduces pain and nausea, doctors were split on the California initiative and medical groups did not endorse it because of the lack of a conclusive study that it was safe and effective.</p>
<p>But some legal experts dismissed the problems with the new state law, noting that while technically it did conflict with federal drug policy it was not likely to change the way drug laws are enforced.</p>
<p>&quot;At the federal level, prosecutors are only interested in drugs if it's a planeload or a busload or some huge amount,&quot; said UCLA law professor Peter Arenella. &quot;Are they going to go after a little old lady who's using marijuana because she's suffering from cancer? I don't think so.&quot;</p>
