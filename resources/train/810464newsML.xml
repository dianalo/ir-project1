<p>Dozens of Katyusha rockets from Lebanon slammed into northern Israel early on Tuesday, lightly injuring at least one person and damaging a building, witnesses and Israeli rescue workers said.</p>
<p>The attack just after 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) occurred a day after violence in Lebanon claimed the lives of at least nine civilians.</p>
<p>&quot;I awoke at 6:30 in the morning. At 7 we heard on the news on the television that it's quiet, everything's OK, and then precisely three or four minutes later there was a barrage of Katyushas, at least 20 or 30 -- a quantity I've never heard before,&quot; a resident named Gavriel told Israeli army radio.</p>
<p>Israeli television stations showed pictures of a house that took a direct hit.</p>
<p>Hizbollah, the Iranian-backed &quot;Party of God,&quot; has been trying to oust Israeli troops and militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army from a 15-km (nine-mile) deep border zone set up inside Lebanon with the declared aim of preventing guerrilla attacks on Israel's northern border.</p>
<p>Shimon Abutbul, director of the public ambulance service in the border town of Kiryat Shmona, told Israel Radio: &quot;The first injured person has arrived...He was lightly wounded. And in other places we are doing checks in various buildings.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel distanced itself from the fighting on Monday.</p>
<p>Lebanese militiamen led by pro-Israeli commander Antoine Lahd killed six civilians and wounded 36, many seriously, in shelling of the coastal town of Sidon.</p>
<p>Israel strongly denied firing those shells and blamed the incident on forces serving under Lahd around the Jezzine area outside the occupation zone patrolled by Israel and Lahd's South Lebanon Army.</p>
<p>Israeli military officials said Lahd's men were apparently avenging the deaths of three youths killed by a roadside bomb in the Jezzine area earlier on Monday. The army accused Hizbollah of carrying out that attack.</p>
