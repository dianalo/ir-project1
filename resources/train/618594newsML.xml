<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Tuesday that, although Japan's trade surplus in goods and services may fluctuate from time to time, it is unlikely to expand drastically.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said that there are worries that Japan may return to an economy that depends on external demand. Top U.S. officials also voiced the same concern when he went to the United States, he said.</p>
<p>With regard to Japan's current account balance, income from previous overseas investments would continue to occupy a certain share in that balance, he said.</p>
<p>What people should be discussing is the surplus in goods and services trade, another component of the current account balance, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This (Japan's surplus in the trade of goods and services) is rapidly shrinking due to economic structural changes. Although there may be temporary fluctuations, I do not think it will expand drastically,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I believe there is a need to realise economic growth led by domestic demand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hashimoto, who was speaking to Japan's top business leaders, said that, for this purpose, it was important to carry out various reforms and deregulation in order to bolster the strength of the private sector.</p>
