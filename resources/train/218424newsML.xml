<title>BELGIUM: Generale Bank revises Franki EPS down.</title>
<headline>Generale Bank revises Franki EPS down.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-11-26</dateline>

<p>Belgium's Generale Bank said on Tuesday it would revise down its earnings per share forecast for construction company Franki and it would maintain its neutral share recommendation made in July.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all, our EPS forecasts (break-even for 1996 and 40 francs for 1997) will be revised downwards,&quot; Generale Bank said in an equity research report following a company visit.</p>
<p>&quot;After our sell recommendation for Franki was turned into a more neutral position last July, we feel it is too soon to enter again,&quot; the Generale Bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors who held on to their shares will have to be patient, and we would not be surprised if the share goes looking for new lows in coming days or weeks,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The report said it was still too soon to anticipate improving results in coming months.</p>
<p>The order portfolio remained at its level of the end of 1995, namely 11.4 billion Belgian francs.</p>
<p>&quot;Second semester results however are below budget and will not be better than the results over the first six months of the year, as was previously set forward,&quot; the statement said, adding that this showed a net loss -- group share -- of 51 million francs.</p>
<p>Market conditions remained extremely tough, the analysts said, with bottom line results likely to suffer from exceptional costs for restructuring and write-downs.</p>
<p>Franki was up 2 francs at 586 francs in midday trading after closing at 584 on Monday.</p>
