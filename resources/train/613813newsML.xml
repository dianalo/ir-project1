<p>China's state-run First Auto Works plans to issue 300 million A shares for domestic investors in an offer that will raise more than 2.0 billion yuan ($240 million), the official Xinhua news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>The company will begin offering the shares on Thursday. The shares are eventually to be listed on the nation's southern stock exchange in Shenzhen near Hong Kong.  </p>
<p>Xinhua did not give a date for the listing of the shares and did not say who the underwriters would be.</p>
<p>Xinhua said the issue would be the biggest capital raising exercise involving the Shenzhen stock exchange.</p>
<p>First Auto would use the funds to expand production of its Hongqi, or Red Flag, sedan to 90,000 units a year by the 2001, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Xinhua quoted the company as saying it was setting up a new manufacturing arm to handle the expanded production.</p>
<p>First Auto's output capacity of Red Flags was now 30,000 cars a year but the firm only made 11,000 units in 1996, Xinhua said. First Auto hoped output would reach 25,000 vehicles this year.  </p>
<p>First Auto has a joint venture with Volkswagen AG at its plant in Changchun to produce Jettas.</p>
<p>The Chinese firm also had a licensing agreement with the Audi arm of Volkswagen to produce the Audi 100 model. That agreement expired in 1996.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has said the Red Flag, which uses a Chrysler Corp engine, is based on the Audi 100.</p>
<p>Xinhua said the Red Flag was China's only copyrighted, domestic-made car model developed by First Auto, but gave no other details.</p>
<p>Audi officials had previously said they hoped to boost Audi's car production in China to 90,000 units a year from 25,000 units by the end of the century.</p>
