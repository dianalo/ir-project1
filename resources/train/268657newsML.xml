<p>Shanghai copper futures ended up sharply with all contracts closing above the key 20,000-yuan resistance level on Thursday due to short-covering, traders said.</p>
<p>The most active April 1997 contract ended at 20,070 yuan ($2,419) per tonne, rising 450 yuan. It opened at an intra-day low of 19,800 and hit a high of 20,080.</p>
<p>January rose 370 to 20,000, February 370 to 20,000, March 440 to 20,060 and May 450 to 20,100.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 66,270 tonnes from 39,710.  </p>
<p>Copper opened higher and rose further with most contracts closing at or near their intra-day highs.</p>
<p>Traders said trading was dull early in the session but short-covering emerged in the afternoon on concern about the stockpile data on the London Metal Exchange which will be announced tonight.</p>
<p>&quot;Short position holders were not sure if the stockpile would fall or rise, so they liquidated their positions in order to evade risks,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But heavy selling will pick up immediately if prices fall on the LME tonight,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today's technical charts showing the market was oversold also helped copper to recover some of its losses of the past few days,&quot; a second trader said.</p>
<p>Analysts given the problems of predicting copper's trend, it was best to take a wait-and-see attitude in the next few days.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended down. The only traded January contract fell 50 yuan to close at 13,850 yuan per tonne with only 60 tonnes traded.</p>
