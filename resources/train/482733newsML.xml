<p>Prime Minister John Major on Wednesday promised low taxes and a hand-up for the have-nots as part of a 25-point programme for the May 1 election that he said would help make Britain the best place in the world to live.</p>
<p>Describing his election manifesto as the boldest any party had published since the ruling Conservatives took power in 1979, Major outlined a wide range of policies aimed at countering charges that his government had run out of steam and ideas.</p>
<p>Major tackled head-on the argument of Tony Blair, leader of the main opposition Labour party, that it was time for a change after 18 unbroken years of Conservative rule.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time for a change. Time for a change to the next phase of Conservative prosperity that will give everyone -- no matter who they are, where they live -- more choice and more control over their lives,&quot; Major told a news conference.</p>
<p>Buoyed by an opinion poll showing Labour's lead had fallen to 14 percentage points, Major said the manifesto was being published against a backcloth of a booming Britain that could look forward to a prosperity undreamed of a few years ago.</p>
<p>The only new policy in the 56-page programme encapsulated Major's ambition to cut taxes and show that Labour does not have a monopoly on measures to help the less well-off.</p>
<p>Major, who last week urged his party to show more compassion, proposed a tax reform that would allow a spouse who has stopped working to care for children or elderly relatives to transfer their personal tax allowance to their working partner.</p>
<p>The scheme would help up to two million families and would cost 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion) a year.</p>
<p>Major said the tax break would not be introduced until it could be afforded, but he underlined the importance he attached to it by saying it would take priority over his goal of reducing the basic income tax rate to 20 percent from 23 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Our aim is to spread opportunity for all to succeed, whoever they are and wherever they come from, provided they are prepared to work hard. To turn the have-nots' into the haves'. To support the family in providing security and stability,&quot; Major said in his foreword to the manifesto.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have paid a heavy political price for failing to keep their promise at the 1992 election not to raise taxes, and Major took pains to leave no new hostages to fortune.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is affordable we will achieve it, but I am not going to say that until we are certain it is affordable,&quot; he said of the goal of a 20 percent tax rate.</p>
<p>But Labour, which has tried to bury its old spendthrift reputation by endorsing many of the Conservatives' tax and spending plans, immediately denounced Major as reckless.</p>
<p>&quot;It's absolutely clear that, as in the 1992 election where there were broken promises, the country will not trust the Tories on tax,&quot; economics spokesman Gordon Brown said.</p>
<p>Turning the tables on the Conservatives, who say Labour has made spending commitments totalling 30 billion pounds, Brown said Major's tax plans could cost 13 billion pounds a year.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is Mr Major risking economic recovery and higher interest rates by a reckless and desperate set of promises?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>The manifesto enshrined the Conservatives' view that it was very unlikely that the European Union could safely launch its planned single currency on time in 1999 but that Britain should keep its options open about joining.</p>
<p>&quot;An enterprise economy; personal prosperity and security; wealth and welfare hand in hand; a state that does less but does it better; a United Kingdom in a Europe of nation states; these are the pillars on which the next stage of Conservatism rests,&quot; Major said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal must be to make Britain the best place in the world to live,&quot; he concluded.</p>
