<p>North Korea's forthcoming harvests will still not yield enough to lift the threat of famine, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Even under the most optimistic scenario, food this year will fall short of requirements,&quot; Ajay Markanday, an economist at the Rome-based agency, told a news conference.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the United Nations food agency said the response to its latest appeal for donations to North Korea was good but more was urgently needed from the international community.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme (WFP) said it had received around 75 percent of the $45.7 million aid it asked for last week.</p>
<p>But WFP director Catherine Bertini said severe malnutrition was still increasing in North Korea, a hermit Stalinist state, and called for even greater donations.</p>
<p>&quot;The international community cannot be seen to stand by as people starve to death or their minds and bodies are destroyed by hunger,&quot; Bertini said.</p>
<p>&quot;I appeal to the international community to be even more generous and to help avert a major humanitarian catastrophe that could haunt generations to come.&quot;</p>
<p>The FAO said that although North Korea was unlikely to suffer devastating floods like those in 1995-96, the next harvest in October would fall well short of self-sufficiency levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, production of rice and maize in 1997 is provisionally forecast at about four million tonnes ... providing that favourable weather conditions continue and that part of the crop is not consumed prematurely as last year, due to food shortages,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Markanday said North Korea would still rely on international donor contributions to meet its needs for most of next year unless more long-term farm projects were implemented.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation won't be remedied by the (1998) harvest unless the medium to long term problems are addressed.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the major problems is that only 20 percent of land in North Korea is arable and the climate meant farmers could only plant from May to October, Markanday said.</p>
<p>FAO consultant Hans-Peter Mueller, who returned this week from a visit to North Korea, said the agency had implemented double-cropping schemes to make better use of cultivated land and had made an appeal for fertilisers.</p>
<p>But he said emergency food aid would remain crucial until long-term measures took hold.</p>
<p>&quot;The public distribution system is near collapse,&quot; he said. &quot;All food needs are being met by food imports or assistance.&quot;</p>
<p>Markanday said the industrial south, which relies heavily on state distribution, was particularly dependent on food handouts, while the north could barter with neighbouring China.</p>
<p>The WFP launched its $46 million appeal last week.</p>
<p>Washington quickly pledged $27 million, bringing its 1997 contributions to $57 million in what was regarded as a goodwill gesture ahead of peace talks between North Korea, South Korea, China and the United States due to start in New York on August 5.</p>
