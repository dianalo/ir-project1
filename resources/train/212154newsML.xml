<p>Steffi Graf stopped the brilliant run of Jana Novotna with a come-from-behind, three-set victory in a classic semifinal Saturday at the $2 million WTA Tour Chase Championships.</p>
<p>Graf lost the first set and was down a break in the third set of the brilliant battle but raised her game when she needed it most to snap Novotna's 14-match winning streak 4-6 6-4 6-3 and reach the final of the elite 16-player event.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it was a really spectacular match,&quot; the 28-year-old Novotna said afterwards. &quot;I gave everything that I had. She was just better at the end.</p>
<p>&quot;She's just a great champion.&quot;</p>
<p>Graf, who clinched sole possession of world number one in the season-ending rankings with her victory, will meet the winner of a later semifinal between 16-year-old Swiss sensation Martina Hingis and 19-year-old Croat Iva Majoli.</p>
<p>The defeat ended Novotna's hopes of finishing the season with four successive titles. The Czech, winner of three tournaments in the last five weeks, could have moved up to a career best number two ranking if she had beaten Graf.</p>
<p>Graf improved her career record against Novotna to 26-4 but the Czech looked at least her equal until breaking down toward the end of a match that had brought the best out in both players.</p>
<p>With the climactic set on serve in the sixth game, Novotna suffered a mental lapse by letting a floating backhand service return drop in without making a play, and then double-faulted on break point to give Graf a 4-2 lead.</p>
<p>That was all the top-seeded German needed, as she roared on from that point to claim victory in a one hour, 58 minute battle that saw the best tennis of the tournament so far.</p>
<p>&quot;She really showed she has the capability,&quot; said Graf, who quit in the final against Novotna last Sunday in Philadelphia because of back spasms.</p>
<p>&quot;She doesn't make a lot of mistakes any more. There are no easy errors. You have to play well to beat her.&quot;</p>
<p>Novotna's slip in the sixth game recalled her third-set collapse in the 1993 Wimbledon final against Graf, where she double-faulted when she was one point away from taking a 5-1 lead and then never won another game.</p>
<p>But the Czech would not ruminate over her mistakes, instead taking comfort from the sensational shot-making that had typified the match up until the end.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't be happier with the way I've been playing,&quot; said the fifth-seeded Novotna, who won 101 total points in the match to 100 for Graf. &quot;In the end she was just a better player than I was.&quot;</p>
