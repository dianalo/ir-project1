<p>The U.S. election campaign row over President Bill Clinton's links to a wealthy Indonesian businessman prompted a call in Jakarta on Wednesday for a parliamentary investigation.</p>
<p>At the centre of the controversy is the Lippo Group, one of the country's biggest conglomerates, and its dapper deputy chairman, Clinton's friend James Riady.</p>
<p>U.S. Republicans, as part of a character attack on Clinton ahead of the November elections, have questioned whether donations from individuals connected to the Lippo Group had influenced administration policies.</p>
<p>A senior Indonesian legislator called for a parliamentary hearing, a Moslem cleric said the attorney-general should be involved, and a newspaper said any Lippo donations were nothing compared to money the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had poured into Indonesia in the past.</p>
<p>U.S.-trained Riady, 39, was working as an intern in a bank in Arkansas when he met and became friendly with Clinton, then governor of the southern U.S. state. Riady was not available for comment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Republican contender Bob Dole was expected to raise the issue during the second and last public debate with Clinton later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Marcel Beding, a legislator and senior member of the Indonesian parliament's foreign affairs committee, said the committee might summon Riady over the reports.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as James Riady is a citizen (of Indonesia), the DPR (parliament) must summon him to give information, even though it (the contribution) may involve his own money,&quot; Beding told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Post newsapaper said in an editorial on Wednesday no one had suggested so far that the donations were illegal and hoped relations between Indonesia and the United States would not be damaged.</p>
<p>It added that questions could equally be asked about the activities of the CIA.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared to the CIA's extensively documented covert operations to channel funds to political organisations in Indonesia in the 1950s, James Riady's contribution is a bagatelle. And at least it is transparent, and until proven otherwise, legal,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A noted Islamic scholor and politician, Amien Rais, said the Attorney-General's Office should call Riady in for questioning.</p>
<p>&quot;As the issue has affected the image of our country, James Riady should be quickly summoned by the attorney-general's department, the sooner the better, and ask him what really happened..,&quot; the nationalist Merdeka daily quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Beding, a member of the minority Indonesia Democratic Party (PDI), opposed this. He said such a summons would be tantamount to condemnation without trial.</p>
<p>But he said parliament should summon Riady because it was a &quot;strange&quot; thing for a citizen of a developing Asian country to help the president of a rich superpower.</p>
<p>Lippo Group is among Indonesia's largest conglomerates, with interests ranging from banking and finance to property, trading, insurance and health care. It has offices and investments in several Asian countries and the United States.</p>
<p>A senior Indonesian foreign policy analyst, Yusuf Wanandi, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, said the issue was a campaign row that he hoped would not damage ties with Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;The Republicans are looking in their election campaign to hit at President Clinton and that is what they have found,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It's politics, and it's presidential election politics.&quot;</p>
