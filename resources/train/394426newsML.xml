<p>Bankrupt French businessman and ex-soccer boss Bernard Tapie, serving an eight-month jail term for rigging a soccer game, was transferred from Paris on Friday to a prison in southern France closer to his ailing father.</p>
<p>Tapie, once a cabinet minister in a Socialist-led government, arrived by prison van at the Luynes jail in the Bouches-du-Rhone department near the constituency that used to elect him to parliament, prison officials said.</p>
<p>Jailed at Paris' La Sante prison since February 3 when the last of his legal appeals failed, the former chairman of Marseille soccer club requested the transfer after his father suffered a heart attack.</p>
<p>He will need special permission to visit his father.</p>
<p>Tapie was sentenced to jail for his role in bribing Valenciennes players to lose a key league match against Marseille in 1993 and give his players an easy game days before they played the European Cup final against AC Milan.</p>
<p>Marseille went on to beat AC Milan, 1-0.</p>
