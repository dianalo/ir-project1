<text>
<p>DUBLIN, Nov 12 - Western Samoa turned on a sparkling five-try display to deservedly beat Ireland 40-25 in their rugby test at Lansdowne Road, NZPA reported on Wednesday (NZT).</p>
<p>The win in Western Samoa's only test of this British tour represents one of the Pacific Islanders' finest international results.</p>
<p>Western Samoa were in a dominating mood from the time lock Potu Leavasa barged into Irish winger Richard Wallace during the pre-match &quot;Manu Samoa&quot; challenge until the final whistle.  </p>
<p>They scored three tries to lead 25-12 at halftime and continued to control play in the second spell, defending doggedly as Ireland desperately tried to cross their line.</p>
<p>The Irish finally managed it in the 71st minute, prop Paul Wallace being driven over, but that was their only moment of glory in front of their own crowd.</p>
<p>Western Samoa's reply to the challenge was, as always, to score again at the other end.</p>
<p>The reply to Wallace's try came through centre To'o Vaega, who glided through the defence to score his second try of the match.  </p>
<p>Fullback Veli Patu had scored the first try of the second half, winning the race to his chip-kick and touching down on the left flank.</p>
<p>First five-eight Earl Va'a, on his test debut, kicked three conversions and three penalties for a personal tally of 15 points.</p>
<p>Ireland's main contributor was fullback Simon Mason who kicked six penalties and a conversion, but he also missed four attempts at goal.</p>
<p>Western Samoa 40 (To'o Vaega 2, Veli Patu, Afato So'oalo, George Leaupepe tries; Earl Va'a 3 pen, 3 con).  </p>
<p>Ireland 25 (Paul Wallace try; Simon Mason six pen, 1 con). Halftime 25-12.</p>
