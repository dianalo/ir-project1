<p>An unsettled session is expected on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index possibly trying to regain its place above the 5,000 level, but only after testing the region around 4,970-4,980 first, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>Bank shares will try to hold steady, while pharmaceuticals will probably halt their recent slide, they added.</p>
<p>By 0725 GMT, the FTSE was indicated down 4.4 at 4,986.9.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, the market has been hopping about, jumping up at some stage only to drop back again in a chaotic and haphazard manner. These have become shorter as the market began to lose form and indicate a weak overall trend developing.  </p>
<p>But a sharp fall in share prices has usually been met by bargain hunters who have been eagerly waiting for a setback and this should cushion any fall in the FTSE today.</p>
<p>Although sellers have had the winning hand so far this week and have driven the FTSE below its 10-day moving average -- which is currently at 5,009 -- the downward pressure appears to be waning.</p>
<p>But buyers and sellers do not appear ready to yield too much and this stalemate should result in yet another erratic day from the index.</p>
