<p>Crude production from the North Sea Nelson field is likely to be cut back by around 60,000 barrels per day on Friday due to problems with the gas system, a spokesman for operator Enterprise Oil said.</p>
<p>He said production was currently running about 10,000 bpd down at 130,000 bpd, but needed to be cut to around 70,000 bpd to prevent excess gas flaring.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll probably be a step change...it'll more than likely be today,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The cut back is likely to last until the middle of next week, but the situation could change, he said.</p>
<p>Nelson feeds into the Forties system, but the details of adjustments to the July loading programme were not yet clear.</p>
<p>Enterprise said that due to a problem with the gas dehydration system, all gas produced at the Nelson field was currently being flared.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to cut back production to prevent excess flaring which is not environmentally acceptable,&quot; said the spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a hangover from the recent production shutdown,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The field had to lower output to about 53,000 bpd in June to allow repairs to a faulty gas compressor.</p>
<p>Production was restored gradually to around 140,000 bpd late in June after the repair was completed. Full capacity is around 160,000 bpd.</p>
