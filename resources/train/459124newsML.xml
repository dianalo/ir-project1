<p>U.S. stock index futures closed higher after a quiet day of positioning heading into next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that yesterday really closed down our trading environment and the next environment really opens up Monday before FOMC,&quot; a Standard and Poor's 500 futures trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a tough week. I think people are just tired,&quot; he added. &quot;We had some incredible moves -- at times just gut wrenching -- and now it's really quiet,&quot; he said. June S&amp;P 500s traded in a more than 23 point range this week and slid to a 5-1/2 week low on Thursday before recovering slightly today.  </p>
<p>Traders said quarterly split expirations had little impact on the market. March S&amp;P 100 index options and individual equity options went off the board at the close and will settle on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't see anything expiration-related -- it's just dead,&quot; the S&amp;P 500 futures trader said.</p>
<p>March S&amp;P 500 futures and March S&amp;P 500 index options went off the board at the close Thursday, and settled based on the open cash price of the index today.</p>
<p>Traders called S&amp;P 500 action listless and predicted a similar tone for Monday.  </p>
<p>At the close, June S&amp;P 500 futures were 3.35 points higher at 791.75, Nasdaq 100s were 10.00 lower at 822.75, KCBT Value Line futures were up 1.20 points at 708.60, Nikkei 225 index futures rose 240.0 to 18,670 and Midcap 400s fell 0.10 points to 262.50.
