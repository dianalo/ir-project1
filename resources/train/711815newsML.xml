<p>Almost a century after it launched one of the world's first state pension systems, New Zealand on Monday unveiled a plan for workers to pay their own way under a compulsory Retirement Savings Scheme (RSS).</p>
<p>If introduced, the much-vaunted and controversial scheme would require all earners who can to save some NZ$120,000 ($81,000) to contribute towards the cost of their own pension.</p>
<p>A referendum in September will decide whether RSS will be introduced. So far, public opposition to the plan has been consistently high, according to opinion polls conducted before the scheme's details were known.</p>
<p>A White Paper released on Monday showed that everyone earning more than NZ$96 a week would have to put three percent of all their taxable income into a suitable, privately-managed fund from next July, so that it builds up to the target annuity level.</p>
<p>The annuity goal is one that officials said some 40 percent of all men and 85 percent of women may never reach, so the state is set to keep carrying a hefty burden of top-up provisions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the government has attempted to make the scheme more attractive, offering a tax cut that would offset the cost of contributions.</p>
<p>Over time the level of contributions would be stepped up, eventually to eight percent, but this will only happen as long as the cabinet can find room in its budgets for matching tax cuts.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the planned launch in 1998 would be exactly one century after New Zealand introduced a state pension for its aged poor -- as one of the first nations in the world to do so.</p>
<p>Whether this new plan will ever become law depends largely on the opinions of a voting public who have shown little interest in the subject.</p>
<p>For Treasurer Winston Peters, who promised to offer voters the option of a self-funded scheme during last year's election campaign, the pension reform has become a personal crusade.</p>
<p>However, political commentators say there seems to be a clear link between recent opinion polls that show low approval ratings for Peters' New Zealand First party and the surveys showing a majority against the RSS concept.</p>
<p>Peters, who believes he has the demographics of a rapidly ageing population and the doctrine of self-help firmly on his side, insisted on Monday the time was right for RSS.</p>
<p>&quot;(It) solves the problem of future affordability posed by the impending retirement of the baby boom generation,&quot; he told a briefing that included representatives of the pension industry.</p>
<p>New Zealand's 3.72 million population, like those of many other developed nations, surged after the end of World War Two, but its growth rate has since slowed.</p>
<p>This means the government now believes it will struggle to support ever higher payouts to an increasingly elderly society.</p>
<p>&quot;Next century it will be harder to provide an adequate retirement income from taxation,&quot; Peters warned.</p>
<p>However, critics and political opponents doubted that many of the arguments underpinning the Treasury's 86-page White Paper.</p>
<p>Opposition Labour Party leader Helen Clark, whose party has enjoyed a surge of support since the centre-right coalition government took power at the end of last year, called RSS &quot;a blueprint for the government's downfall&quot;.</p>
<p>It was based on what she called &quot;the shonky assumption that current superannuation arrangements are unsustainable&quot;. The Council of Trade Unions said the scheme appeared too rigid to allow any overlap with employer-based pension schemes that many workers have signed up for in recent years.</p>
<p>It recommended that people in professional schemes vote against RSS in the referendum.</p>
