<p>Italy on Sunday welcomed the election victory of Iran's moderate president-elect Mohammad Khatami and said it hoped that the scale of his triumph would enable him to improve Tehran's ties with Europe.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said Italy had congratulated Khatami on his landslide win. He took 69 percent of the vote on a huge turnout after the fiercest election campaign since the 1979 revolution led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p>
<p>&quot;Italy hopes...that this mandate, which has received such broad support from the Iranian people, will allow the president to guide his country towards a policy that will strengthen Iran's ties with Italy and with Europe,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>Khatami's conservative rival, parliament speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, had received the backing of the bulk of Iran's conservative Islamic clergy-dominated parliament but had to settle for 25 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>More than 200 members of the 270-seat Majlis sent a message to Khatami pledging to cooperate fully on Sunday in a political about-face after his emphatic victory.</p>
<p>Outgoing president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani also offered to help Khatami carry out his programmes and plans. The handover is due to take place in August.</p>
<p>Italy, which has strong trade ties with Iran, joined other European Union countries in recalling its ambassador for consultations after German court verdict implicated the country's top leadership in the assassination of Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin restaurant in 1992.</p>
