<headline>German soccer team rallies behind English anthem.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-29</dateline>

<p>The Germans may have beaten England in last year's European championship, but when they wanted a soccer anthem for the nation to rally behind, they turned to an Englishman, writing in English.</p>
<p>Composer Mike Batt admitted being somewhat baffled when he was approached by the Germans.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very surprised to find myself writing the anthem for England's main opponents,&quot; the prolific songwriter told the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea felt uncomfortable for about five minutes but goals win matches, not anthems.&quot;</p>
<p>Batt, whose hits include the chart-topping Bright Eyes and a string of successes for 1970s pop group The Wombles, was commissioned to write the song after a chat with German team manager Berti Vogts.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the meeting he said: 'Oh, sorry for winning the European championship',&quot; Batt told the Guardian.</p>
<p>Germany beat England on penalties in the semi-final -- as they did in the 1990 World Cup in Italy -- before taking the title with a 2-1 win over the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Batt will conduct the anthem, entitled Running With a Dream, in front of 13 million television viewers on September 6 before Germany play Romania.</p>
<p>The English words should not pose too much of a problem. &quot;The German pop (music) charts are full of English-speaking artists,&quot; he said.</p>
