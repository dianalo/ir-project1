<headline>London freight rates hold mostly steady.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>There was no general trend in the dry cargo freight market on Tuesday although positive factors for owners continue to predominate, brokers said.</p>
<p>The BFI was up six points to 1,513 as a result of higher rate levels reported for Atlantic Panamaxes (40 pct of the index weighting), but the advance was limited by slightly weaker conditions perceived for these vessels in early positions in the north Pacific.</p>
<p>Caper rates were generally very steady. Handy-size conditions varied considerably -- poor on the continent and possibly softening in the Far East -- but still firm in the US Gulf and from East Coast South America.</p>
<p>News from the Mississippi about delays resulting from the Bright Field accident was sketchy.</p>
<p>Most brokers believed that vessels and barges up river from New Orleans would continue to be affected by restrictions.</p>
<p>Grain -- There was very little fresh enquiry quoted today and no fixtures reported on voyage basis.</p>
<p>However early Panamax grain business covered on timecharter in the Atlantic was still costing charterers more.</p>
<p>Navix paid a very firm $15,250 daily for the Belships-relet Anangel Venture 69,000 dwt delivery Bremen Dec 22/24, trip via US Gulf with grain to Japan at $15,750 daily.</p>
<p>A week ago Interbulk was reported to have fixed Beauty Sea 69,365 dwt, delivery Antwerp mid Dec for three-five months redelivery Atlantic at $11,000 daily, and today this vessel was said to have been relet to South Korean charterers on the same terms at $13,000 daily.</p>
<p>Brokers reported Panamax owners cutting rates for North Pacific rounds ahead of the Christmas holidays and the Japanese New Year break.</p>
<p>On the other hand grain chartering activity from Australia to India and Egypt was said to be increasing and there was talk of forthcoming sales of grain from western Canada to India.</p>
<p>Very little emerged about handy-size shipments, although Continental may have covered about 25,000 wheat up river/Tunisia, following Tradigrais fixture in this trade at the end of last week at $29.00.</p>
<p>It was suggested that Shinwa's booking of Cebu 27,000 dwt delivery prompt Japan for a Nopac round at $6,500 daily was to cover a grain stem.</p>
<p>Minerals -- Some Caper rates were firmer. It emerged that P and O fixed Mineral Dragon at the end of last week for about 145,000 tonnes coal Richards Bay to Rotterdam for end Jan at close to $7.00, up from last fixed 110,000 tonnes at $6.85.</p>
<p>Bocimar paid in the region of $7.00/7.25 basis 1-2 or Marine Corona for 135,000 coal Richards Bay/Rotterdam and Antwerp.</p>
<p>Rohstoffhandel was rumoured to have agreed a firmer rate for frontline tonnage for Seven Islands/Rotterdam for first half January and also to have taken the 1977-built Africana 137,000 dwt for similar business for February at just below $6.00.</p>
<p>Klaveness booked Cattlya Star for 90,000 iron ore Nouadhibou/Dunkirk East for Jan 5/20 at $5.50.</p>
<p>In the Panamaxes, Navios chartered Oceanic Explorer 68,900 dwt delivery Taiwan early January for three-five months at a solid $11,500 daily.</p>
<p>Evlimeni 64,000 dwt was rumoured taken by Pan Ocean delivery Bin Qasim for short period business.</p>
<p>In the Atlantic, Cargill was still on subjects for 55,000/10 coal Maracaibo/Ijmuiden.</p>
<p>Cockerill was understood to have covered 70,000/10 coal Mobile/Antwerp, and Merchant Pilot 60,000 dwt was linked with a bauxite fixture from Kamsar to Aughinish, but further details were lacking.</p>
<p>Handy-sizes -- The continent was very flat. Skaugen fixed a GRT-relet 38,000 dwt vessel for two Norway/UK rounds with Olivine Sands at $8,250 daily.</p>
<p>Allied signal booked tonnage for 30,000 ammonium sulphate Hopewell and Norfolk/Maceio and Recife for Jan 5/20 at close to $22.00 basis 2-2.</p>
<p>MSL fixed a 29,000 dwt craned bulker delivery South Africa for five-seven months at about $6,500 daily with redelivery Atlantic.</p>
<p>Good Pal 42,000 dwt was rumoured fixed to T K Boesen for short period business at $7,000/7,250 daily level but other details were lacking.</p>
