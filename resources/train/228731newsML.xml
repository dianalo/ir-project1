<p>A Miami group calling for a referendum to dissolve the financially troubled city has collected enough voter signatures to put the proposal on the ballot, one of the organizers said Monday.</p>
<p>Attorney Gene Stearns said the group had collected far more than the 13,800 signatures needed, and would make an announcement on Tuesday as to when the petitions would be submitted to the Dade County election supervisor for verification.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there will be any serious question. We have more signatures than often vote in City of Miami elections,&quot; Stearns said.</p>
<p>He said petition drive organizers had already verified most of the signatures themselves.</p>
<p>Once the election supervisor's office verifies the signatures, the Dade County Commission would have 120 days to put the proposal before voters.</p>
<p>If the proposal passes, Miami would be abolished as an independent city and would be merged into the Metro-Dade County government. Its pension obligations would become Dade County obligations, and city employees would have first rights to new county jobs created by the merger, Stearns said.</p>
<p>Miami is struggling to close a $68 million deficit in its $275 budget for the fiscal year that began Oct 1.</p>
<p>Last week, Mayor Joe Carollo told Gov Lawton Chiles he would welcome the appointment of a state emergency board to run the city, a move the governor has not yet taken.</p>
<p>&quot;An appointed board to represent any municipality sort of indicates the depth of the problem. When you have to do that, then you've got to go back to the drawing board and figure out where we went wrong,&quot; Stearn said.</p>
<p>The deficit was discovered after the former city manager and city finance officer resigned to face federal corruption charges.</p>
