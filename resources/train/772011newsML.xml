<p>Russian government securities with maturities  of between four to eight years made their trading debut on Friday,  sparking demand for other long paper and pushing yields on long-term  debt down, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rouble edged up on rouble purchases by the central bank and arbitrage.</p>
<p>*Banks transferred 1.68 trln rbls for trading</p>
<p>*Central bank sold 543 bln rbls of T-bills</p>
<p>*Average yield rose to 18.1 pct from 17.9 pct on Thursday</p>
<p>*Turnover fell to 3.27 trln rbls from 4.15 trln rbls</p>

<p>The Russian Central Bank started offering 30.71 trillion roubles in  five OFZ interest-bearing bond issues, each with an annual yield of  17.5 percent and maturities running from four to eight years, from  its portfolio on Thursday.</p>
<p>Although the yield is lower than on long-term GKO discount Treasury  bills, the market bought the new paper in anticipation of even lower-yield  paper to come, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The offer of the paper gives a new orientation for yields on long-term  instruments,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Under these conditions, even if there is not very much money in the  trading system, it is only natural for the market participants to  start thinking about what the situation will be later, although it  is admittedly economically unprofitable to buy the OFZs.&quot;</p>
<p>Annual government paper yields have fallen to about 18 percent annually  from about 30 percent in May and the goverment said they would fall  even further.</p>
<p>United City Bank dealer Stanislav Kuchinsky said the fact that there  were deals, no matter how few, indicating players believed government  prognoses that yields would fall further.</p>
<p>&quot;The yields have already hit bottom, but they will not go up as we  can see that huge sales by the Finance Ministry do not lead to a rise  in the rates. The market absorbs them happily,&quot; Kuchinsky said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices of long-term T-bills went up because of this, but the Finance  Ministry sales slowed it down.&quot;</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry sold 1.5 trillion roubles worth of long-term  T-bills this week.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange market, the rouble firmed, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason for the shortage is that a lot of roubles went to the  central bank as banks have been buying hard currency from it in small  lots,&quot; a Mezhkombank dealer said. &quot;Banks probably also have rouble  payments to make.&quot;</p>
