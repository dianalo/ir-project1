<headline>BASEBALL-FINLEY, JOHNSON REPLACE LOFTON, HUNDLEY FOR ALL-STARS.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>San Diego Padres centre fielder Steve Finley and Florida Marlins catcher Charles Johnson were named to the National League All-Star team Sunday as replacements for the injured Kenny Lofton and Todd Hundley.</p>
<p>Finley and Johnson will both be making their first-ever All-Star appearances.</p>
<p>Lofton was activated from the disabled list Saturday, but the Atlanta centre fielder aggravated his strained left groin in Saturday night's 5-3 win at Montreal and did not play in Sunday's game against the Expos.</p>
<p>Although Lofton will not play Tuesday, he will return to Cleveland's Jacobs Field for the first time since the March 25 trade which sent him from the Indians to Atlanta in exchange for outfielders David Justice and Marquis Grissom.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old Lofton is hitting .344 with three homers, 33 RBI and 19 stolen bases.</p>
<p>Hundley missed the New York Met's four-game weekend series against Florida due to an inflamed ligament in his right elbow. Hundley, named to the NL All-Star team for the first time last year, is batting .300 with 19 homers and 51 RBI.</p>
<p>Finley is batting .283 with 16 homers and 55 RBI despite having appeared in only 67 of the Padres' first 86 games due to elbow and groin injuries.</p>
<p>Johnson, regarded as the best defensive catcher in the National League, is batting .226 with six homers and 24 RBI.</p>
