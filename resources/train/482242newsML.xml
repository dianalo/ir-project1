<p>The U.S. Energy Department said Wednesday it would offer an operating working interest of at least 51 percent and several non-operating interests when it puts its Elk Hills oil and gas field stake up for sale.</p>
<p>Under a law signed last year, the government must sell its 78 percent portion of the field, co-owned by Chevron Corp, by February 1998, as long as the price is right.</p>
<p>The Department said it would offer working interests of at least 51 percent in each of the productive zones of the field, and divide the rest into non-working interests each representing 2 percent of its stake in each of the zones.  </p>
<p>&quot;We do still anticipate that the solicitation (for bids) will go out later this month,&quot; said fossil energy spokesman Bob Porter.</p>
<p>The sale of the field, among the 11 largest in the lower 48 states, is expected to be one of the biggest privatizations ever by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Prospective buyers will be allowed to bid on any or all of the interests being sold.</p>
<p>Assistant energy secretary Patricia Fry Godley said the department's investment bank advisors had recommended setting an operating interest of 51 percent in each zone &quot;to ensure that there would be no question over which owner held a majority interest in the field after the sale.&quot;</p>
<p>The department said it had &quot;not dismissed the possibility of selling a protion of its interests in Elk Hlils in ways which could appeal to institutional investors, if such a structure would help maximize value to the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>Chevron and the Energy Departrment are still setting the final split in ownership of production from each of the field's four producing zones.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, the department said it would structure the bidding process to ensure that the winning buyer of the operating interest would own at least 51 percent of each zone.</p>
<p>The department also announced it would sell its interest in the field's surface facilities, including large natural gas processing plants and a cogeneration plant, as part of the undivided working interests in the field.</p>
<p>In line with the law ordering the sale, the department has named five independent experts to assess the value of the field, in order for the government to set a minium sale price: Miller and Lents, Ltd; Scotia Group, Inc; S.A. Holditch and Associates, Inc; Ernst &amp; Young LLP; and Gaffney, Cline and Associates.</p>
