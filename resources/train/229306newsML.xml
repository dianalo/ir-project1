<p>Two Kurdish militiamen died in fighting at the weekend between rival groups in northern Iraq that could put Western-brokered peace talks in danger, an Iraqi Kurdish faction said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;KDP forces attacked on November 30 at Didevan, a mountain 30 km (18 miles) southwest of Koy Sanjak town and they took it from us,&quot; Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) Ankara representative Shazad Saib told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The clashes continued yesterday, killing two PUK fighters,&quot; he said. Officials from the rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The two sides have held several rounds of peace talks under U.S., British and Turkish mediation since they declared a ceasefire in October to end months of fighting that had increased Baghdad's influence in the mountainous region.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very negative indication for the future of the peace talks,&quot; Saib said.</p>
<p>Iraqi troops and tanks helped Massoud Barzani's KDP take the key city of Arbil from the rival faction in August, prompting U.S. missile strikes on Iraqi targets in retaliation.</p>
<p>The Kurds broke from Baghdad after the 1991 Gulf War. They are protected from any Iraqi attack by a U.S.-led allied air force.</p>
<p>&quot;We heard those reports over the weekend but we are hoping that those clashes are local in nature and will not effect their ongoing efforts to strenghten the ceasefire,&quot; Turkey's foreign ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli told a news briefing.</p>
