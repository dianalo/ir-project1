<title>KENYA: Kenyan &quot;guerrilla&quot; dies in freak accident.</title>

<p>A Kenyan ex-soldier died in a freak accident in a police car after putting off plans to confess he was an anti-government guerrilla, newspapers reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Peter Mwangi died of his injuries after the vehicle was rammed by a train near the central town of Nakuru last Thursday evening, the newspapers said, quoting police and survivors.</p>
<p>He was the only fatality.</p>
<p>President Daniel arap Moi announced on September 7 that a guerrilla group had plotted to assassinate him and other prominent politicians and overthrow the government.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians have poured scorn on the plot claims, saying they were part of a government disinformation campaign ahead of elections expected next year.</p>
<p>Moi pardoned two men, Herbert Lusiola and Anthony Njui, who confessed at a public rally addressed by Moi to their role in the plot.</p>
<p>Lusiola, also an ex-soldier, suffered a broken left-hand in Thursday's accident. He told the East African Standard from his hospital bed that the police car was driving Mwangi home after he postponed his earlier intention to confess his guerrilla activities.</p>
<p>Moi has promised amnesty to members of the alleged group if they confessed within three weeks.</p>
<p>Members of Njui's family have publicly accused him of lying and making his confession for financial reward.</p>
<p>The &quot;neighbouring country&quot; has not been named. But last year Moi implicitly accused Uganda of giving military training to Kenyan subversives.</p>
<p>The row with Uganda appeared to have been buried after Moi and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni held reconciliation meetings and later resumed East African trade and political cooperation with Tanzania.</p>
