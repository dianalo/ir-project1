<p>German IBIS DAX index rises around 1.5 percent in extremely quiet pre-bourse trade on Tuesday, as a stable close on Wall Street overnight took some of the pressure off the German equity market.</p>
<p>The rise of the dollar, looking increasingly rampant after the Bundesbank refrained from springing a surprise variable rate tender, also comforted the increasingly jittery market.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going through the roof today, but we are also not going to go through the floor. Movements of 100 points in either direction in the current environment are really nothing special at the moment,&quot; a Frankfurt trader said.  </p>
<p>By 0751 GMT the IBIS DAX index was up 59.48 points at 4,361.98, recouping some of Monday's losses, while the September DAX future was also stronger, up 51.5 points at 4,377.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very quiet and we could go either way today, but I think that in the next few days we will see the consolidation take hold properly, which is very healthy for the market at the moment,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The main news of the morning was the decision by the powerful Bundesbank to leave monetary policy on hold for the time being.  </p>
<p>The central bank called for bids for securities repurchase funds at an unchanged interest rate of three percent.</p>
<p>There had been speculation that it could engineer higher money-market rates by calling for a variable-rate tender alongside the expected fixed-rate tender.</p>
<p>This speculation had driven the dollar nearly 1.5 pfennigs down from its peaks against the mark overnight, but the Bundesbank's &quot;no-change&quot; announcement soon set the dollar back on its upwards march.</p>
<p>By around 0800 GMT the dollar was within sight of 1.87 marks.  </p>
<p>Export stocks profited from the dollar advance, as has been the theme for many weeks now. Chemical group Hoechst AG was up over two percent at 85.30 marks, while BASF AG was up around 1.80 percent at 71.20 marks.</p>
<p>Airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG was up 2.45 percent at 35.59 marks, while the carmaker BMW AG was up over two percent at 1,484.50 marks.</p>
