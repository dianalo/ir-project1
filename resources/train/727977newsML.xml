<p>U.S. fixed-income markets will be engrossed by inflation and production data on Wednesday, although neither is expected to create much market volatility, analysts said.</p>
<p>Consumer price data should provide yet more evidence of a benign inflation environment, they said. Few market observers were expecting numbers that diverged significantly from consensus estimates.</p>
<p>In the end, the bond market's recent positive tone is expected to continue unhindered on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure we'd get much of a reaction from such numbers but I think it would continue to support the little bit more positive tone we've seen in recent sessions,&quot; said Kim Rupert, senior economist at Standard &amp; Poor's MMS.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries ended flat to slightly higher on Tuesday, overcoming pressure by a somewhat stronger-than-expected retail sales report. A weak report of July sales from the Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc Redbook bolstered prices.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond closed up 4/32 at 101-1/32 to yield 6.55 percent.  </p>
<p>Back to CPI, Peter D'Antonio, senior economist at Citicorp Global Finance, forecasts a benign gain in CPI with little risk for surprises. If anything, he said there could be a possible exception in food prices given the drop seen in that component of last Friday's producer price report.</p>
<p>Variations in Reuters' survey are remarkably few regarding the Consumer Price Index, all entries tight to the average forecasted rise of 0.2 percent overall and 0.2 percent excluding the volatile food and energy components.</p>
<p>The CPI and U.S. business inventories will be released at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Inventories are expected to have grown by 0.3 percent in May versus a 0.3 percent rise in April. Analysts expect the data to carry little weight on the market because of its &quot;old&quot; nature and the release of manufacturing data by the Federal Reserve at 0915 EDT/1315 GMT.</p>
<p>However, James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities, noted the economy is in the midst of inventory building and a strong number could explain recent strength in production, jobless claims and the National Association of Purchasing Managers index.  </p>
<p>&quot;A number up, say 0.6 would explain why production...are all strong even though demand has slowed,&quot; Glassman said. &quot;Most people would view that as hopeful because inventories don't grow at a rapid rate forever. At some point businesses have their inventories to where they want them and the whole thing slows.&quot;</p>
<p>Inventories are unlikely to prompt a market reaction, Glassman said. Should CPI read as expected, market focus will surely turn to the Federal Reserve's release of industrial production and capacity use data.  </p>
<p>Economists in the Reuters survey forecasted that June data would show industrial production rose 0.2 percent while capacity use dropped by 0.1 percent to 83.6 percent.</p>
<p>D'Antonio noted revisions may strike some interest after upward revisions to April data. Revisions for April went from 83.4 to 83.6, topped by a 0.1 percent increase in May.</p>
<p>&quot;It fooled a lot of people,&quot; D'Antonio said. &quot;People were expecting it to go lower from what we had at 83.4...but my feeling, though, is that we'll go by both (CPI and industrial production) without any hitch.&quot;</p>
<p>But a rise in production is nearly certain given the healthy outlook provided by regional manufacturing surveys.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on Wednesday, the Treasury will announce details of its next two- and five-year note auctions.</p>
