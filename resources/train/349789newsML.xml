<p>Sao Paulo police shot and killed a man on Saturday after rappelling into his apartment during an armed stand-off later shown on Globo television.</p>
<p>Globo played an amateur videotape showing Oswaldo Manoel da Silva, 29, a pistol in each hand, smashing a window and shouting at police: &quot;I'll be dead if I come down.&quot;</p>
<p>The stand-off, which began after a violent domestic argument, ended when three officers rappelled onto da Silva's balcony, dragged him to the floor and then into the apartment.</p>
<p>Shots were heard inside the apartment. Da Silva was put in the back of a police van and pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital, Globo reported.</p>
<p>A police officer in charge of the operation later told the television station &quot;(Da Silva) pulled out his weapons and shot at the team. The team fired back. That was all that happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Da Silva's wife, Maria Carmo dos Santos, said her husband had been taking drugs after his two motorcycle showrooms ran into financial difficulties.</p>
