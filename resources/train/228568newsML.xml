<title>USA: S. Carolina couple jailed for beating boy.</title>
<headline>S. Carolina couple jailed for beating boy.</headline>
<dateline>MANNING, S.C. 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>A white couple was sentenced to two years in prison on Monday for beating a 10-year-old black boy.</p>
<p>Benjamin and Betty Mims were taken to prison shortly after the sentencing on Monday morning.</p>
<p>A jury found them guilty on Nov. 22 of assault and battery against Dwight Miller but not guilty on a lynching charge. The boy survived the beating and had testified in court about it. The couple had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.</p>
<p>Residents of this central South Carolina county, a mainly rural area, crowded into the courtroom at the Clarendon County Courthouse for the sentencing.</p>
<p>Security was tight, reflecting the racial tension that has divided the community since the Mimses were charged with lynching and beating Dwight last January.</p>
<p>Although some residents expressed concern that the Mimses were given a lenient sentence, there were no outbursts when Circuit Court Judge Thomas Cooper announced his decision. The couple could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison on the assault conviction.</p>
<p>Dwight testified that the Mimses accused him of stealing, then drove him into the woods where they tied him to a tree, beat him and fired a shotgun at him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mims, 44, testified she did not hurt the child and said the charges &quot;ruined my life&quot;.</p>
<p>Her husband, Benjamin Mims, 63, said he never saw the boy at his house that day.</p>
