<p>Japanese Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa said on Thursday he would not comment on a senior Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) official's reported remarks that the government will keep open the option of fiscal stimulus in a fiscal reform law it plans to draw up by the end of June.  </p>
<p>Asked about reports that the government may keep open the option of implementing fiscal stimulus measures such as a supplementary budget in the planned fiscal reform law, Ogawa said: &quot;I cannot mention anything concrete about it.&quot;  </p>
<p>Earlier, Jiji news agency quoted Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) policy research council, as saying that the government will not rule out fiscal stimulus options in the reform bill.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be cautious in handling fiscal stimulus steps, but we will make sure in the fiscal reform law that emergency fiscal measures necessary for economic management are possible,&quot; Jiji quoted Yamasaki as saying.  </p>
<p>Ogawa said the economy will continue to strengthen despite the effect from fiscal reform plans the government announced earlier this week.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be effects from the fiscal (reform) measures, but despite that, the economy as a whole, will continue to gain strength,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet approved on Tuesday a government panel report which called for cuts in key areas of spending with the aim of keeping next year's general expenditures 0.5 percent below this year's levels.</p>
<p>The fiscal reform bill will incorporate the report's contents.</p>
