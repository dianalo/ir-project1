<p>NOTE: Q2 1997 net loss was $9.3 million or $.26 a share including a one-time $8.5 million after-tax charge for an asset writedown related to its investment in a natural gas storage project.</p>
<p>Before the charge, ERI had a net loss of $813,000, or $.02 per share. According to First Call, Wal Street analysts had expected a profit of $0.05 a share.</p>
<p>Q2 1996 earnings were $928,000, or $.03 a share, which included a charge for closing natural gas price hedges. Earnings from operations for the 1996 period were $2.1 million, or $.06 per share.</p>
<p>ERI said results were impacted by higher prices for produced natural gas and higher margins for natural gas liquids sales which were more than offset by increased operating expenses primarily related to ERI Services which experienced longer than anticipated delays in project construction start-ups. Results also were impacted by lower margins from unregulated sales in the utilities segment.</p>
<p>The charge related to the storage project involves ERI's 25 percent general partnership interest in the Avoca, NY, bedded salt, natural gas storage project. The project has encountered technical difficulties which have significantly delayed development and will probably result in discontinuation of the project.</p>
