<p>Singapore gas oil swaps were unchanged late afternoon on Monday as the market looked fresh buying from a local trader to more than offset the bearish effects of a weak crude, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is steady despite the weak crude as they are looking to Hin Leong to pick up the slack,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The front month April gas oil was last quoted down at $26.45/$26.55 per barrel, down from Friday's $26.75/$26.85, brokers said.</p>
<p>April traded earlier in the day at $26.60, they said.  </p>
<p>May gas oil was last quoted almost unchanged at $25.15/$25.35 per barrel in volatile trading, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said May traded in the morning at $25.20 before edging down to $25.15 but picked up in the afternoon to trade at $25.25 before easing slightly.</p>
<p>Traders said the market is unfazed by the crude falls as they are counting on Hin Leong to continue buying for at least afew more days.  </p>
<p>In a surprise move, on Friday, Hin Leong bought 520,000-barrels of diesel at $26.90-$26.90 per barrel for loading in end April/early May, taking its tally to almost eight million barrels since the buying spree started on March 3.</p>
<p>Traders said if the buying spate continued at such a rate, then the arrival of the huge arbitrage cargoes would make only a small dent in the market.</p>
<p>On Friday, May Brent crude lost 50 cents to close at $17.68 per barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange--taking its loses for the week to $1.43. Brent rebounded slightly on Monday to last trade at up 10 cents at $17.88.  </p>
<p>The April jet fuel/gas oil regrade widened slightly to last quote at -1.00/-80 cents, down from Friday's -0.90/-0.70, brokers said.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps were unchanged with May last quoted at $97.00/$98.00, and traded earlier in the day at $96.75, brokers said.</p>
