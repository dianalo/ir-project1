<p>A higher volume of term loans and absence of call money deals pushed up the Croatian average lending rate to 13.0 percent on Tuesday from 9.0 percent in very slow trade and amid high liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>Daily settlements totalled only 11.75 million kuna, with fresh trade at &quot;an exceptionally low 6.25 million kuna,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Accounts are good so only banks which wanted term loans struck some deals,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Call money deals, which usually make up most trade and vary between eight and nine percent, were not made on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A one-week loan was granted to a savings bank at 15 percent. One-month loans were struck at 30 percent while two- and three-month borrowings were granted at 18 percent.</p>
<p>Banks rolled over previous one-week deals at 11 percent and one-month deals at 10.2 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank's kuna midrates for Wednesday eased to 6.4657 from 6.4012 against the dollar and to 3.5744 from 3.5681 against the German mark. -- Zoran Radosavljevic, Zagreb newsroom +385 1 455 7075</p>
