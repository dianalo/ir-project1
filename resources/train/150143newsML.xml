<title>CROATIA: Yugoslav foreign minister in Croatia for talks.</title>
<headline>Yugoslav foreign minister in Croatia for talks.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1996-10-28</dateline>

<p>Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic met Croatian government leaders in Zagreb on Tuesday in his first official visit since a normalisation treaty that solidified peace in the Balkans.</p>
<p>State radio said Milutinovic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic discussed economic and humanitarian concerns, including people missing from the 1991-95 Serbian-Croatian conflict, in an initial round of talks.</p>
<p>Milutinovic then met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman at his presidential palace, and arranged further talks with Granic after a stroll through part of downtown Zagreb. A press statement was expected later in the day.</p>
<p>Croatian media said Granic and Milutinovic planned to sign an agreement abolishing a visa requirement for diplomats of either country and would discuss a consular convention.</p>
<p>They signed accords for full diplomatic relations on August 23 after a surprise summit between Tudjman and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, ending a conflict that began with Croatia's secession from federal Yugoslavia in 1991.</p>
<p>Rump Yugoslavia, whose dominant republic is Serbia, also recognised Croatia's sovereignty over the last rebel Serb enclave on its territory, Eastern Slavonia, now under transitional U.N. administration.</p>
<p>Minority Krajina Serbs seized almost a third of Croatia in a 1991 revolt against independence backed by the Yugoslav army.</p>
<p>The Croatian army reconquered two of three Serb enclaves in blitz offensives in 1995 after Yugoslavia, keen to be rid of punitive U.N. sanctions largely rescinded this year, signalled it would not intervene.</p>
<p>Croatian government sources said Granic would also seek consensus with Milutinovic on when U.N. authorities should formally hand back Eastern Slavonia to Zagreb's rule.</p>
<p>Zagreb has reluctantly agreed to a recommendation by the U.N. administrator for an extension of the mandate into the spring of 1997 from the current expiry date of January 15, with U.N. peacekeeping troops leaving by early summer.</p>
