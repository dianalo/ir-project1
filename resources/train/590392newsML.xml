<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Hewlett drop taken in stride.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Options investors took the drop in Hewlett-Packard Co shares in stride Friday, with some taking positions expecting a rebound, traders said.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, the computer and printer maker reported weaker than expected fiscal second quarter earnings, prompting a few Wall Street brokerage firms to lower their ratings on the stock.</p>
<p>In afternoon action, Hewlett was down six at 52-7/8 on volume of more than 13.3 million shares. The stock reached a session low of 51-1/4.  </p>
<p>John Streibich, a market maker in Hewlett-Packard options, said options trading was &quot;100 percent two-way paper&quot;.</p>
<p>He said many investors were closing out options positions that had been put on before the earnings announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people were buying calls on the selloff as a buying opportunity and some were buying puts in case the stock keeps going lower,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The most active Hewlett options included the June 55 call, with volume of about 6,320, the expiring May 55 call, with volume of 3,405, and the May 55 put, with volume of 3,235.  </p>
<p>The June 50 and 60 calls, the June 50 and 55 puts and the August 55 and 60 calls also were fairly active.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of times in a situation like this, you see big firms putting on a play, but as of yet nothing like that has happened,&quot; Streibich said.</p>
<p>Traders said some investors were trying to buy puts Thursday after the earnings came out and before the options market closed, expecting the stock to fall.</p>
<p>At about 1605 EDT/2005 GMT Thursday, Hewlett said its fiscal second quarter earnings were $784 million, or $0.75 per share, compared with $723 million, or $0.69 a share, a year ago.  </p>
<p>But the results fell short of industry analysts' consensus expectation of $0.80 a share.</p>
<p>Stocks close at 1600 EDT/2000 GMT, but equity options remain open until 1610 EDT/2010 GMT.</p>
<p>That, however, will change on June 23, when equity options will close at 1602 EDT/2002 GMT.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission Thursday approved proposals from the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange to advance the closing. A similar proposal from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange is expected to be approved by June 23.  </p>
<p>&quot;The 4:05 (1605 EDT/2005 GMT) earnings release is really tough on market makers, brokers and exchange staff,&quot; Streibich said. He noted that Hewlett shares were halted for trading after the earnings were released.</p>
<p>Streibich added that volatility in the June and August Hewlett options dropped Friday to the mid-30 region from around 40 prior to the earnings report.</p>
<p>&quot;It's gone down but it hasn't dropped that much,&quot; he said.</p>
