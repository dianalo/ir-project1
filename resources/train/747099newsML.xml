<p>Amax Gold Inc's CEO said on Tuesday the company expects record production of about 700,000 ounces in 1997 and cash costs in the low $200 per ounce range.</p>
<p>Milton Ward, chairman and chief executive officer, said, &quot;Amax Gold expects record production of about 700,000 ounces in 1997 with cash costs in the low $200 per ounce range.&quot;</p>
<p>Amax Gold's average realized price for the second quarter and the first six months of 1997 was $374 per ounce and $379 per ounce, respectively, compared with $412 per ounce for the comparable 1996 periods.  </p>
<p>This compares with an average spot gold price of $343 per ounce and $348 per ounce for the second quarter and first six months of 1997.</p>
<p>In June 1997, the company had record production of 75,390 ounces of gold at an average cash cost of $182 per ounce.</p>
<p>Gold production was a record 192,493 ounces for the second quarter of 1997, more than triple the 62,023 ounces produced in the 1996 second quarter.  In June 1997, the company had record production of 75,390 ounces of gold at an average cash cost of $182 per ounce.  </p>
<p>The company's second quarter 1997 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to 59 percent compared with 77 percent for the prior year's second quarter, reflecting lower average cash costs.  Average total cash costs were reduced by nearly 28 percent to $194 per ounce for the second quarter of 1997 from $268 per ounce in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Ward said that commercial production at Kubaka, the company's new mine in Russia, was achieved by June 1, earlier than anticipated this year, and the ramp-up of the mine toward full production is progressing ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>&quot;Kubaka's first month of commercial operations produced 17,432 ounces for the company's account at a cash cost of $160 per ounce, which is better than expected,&quot; added Ward.</p>
<p>Amax Gold explores for and develops gold and silver properties in the western United States, New Zealand, Chile and Russia.</p>
