<p>Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky said on Friday the tobacco agreement may permit price fixing by cigarette companies unless it is changed.</p>
<p>Pitofsky told a small group of reporters that the tobacco agreement includes an antitrust exemption.</p>
<p>&quot;The exemption is written in such a way that I believe -- maybe they didn't intend it this way -- it could cover price fixing,&quot; Pitofsky said.</p>
<p>&quot;Four companies could get together after this agreement is implemented and agree on how much this agreement is costing them -- 50 cents a pack, 75 cents a pack. And under that provision, I think they could agree on how much to add to a pack of cigarettes.&quot;</p>
<p>Pitofsky said although some tobacco critics believe that prices should increase in order to discourage smoking, any revenues derived should be taxed rather than go to the tobacco companies.</p>
<p>&quot;If your goal is to raise prices, let's do it through a tax where the money goes to the Treasury, as opposed to price fixing by the four companies where the money goes to the four companies,&quot; Pitofsky said.</p>
<p>Price fixing is a classic antitrust violation with heavy criminal penalties. Under U.S. law, companies are supposed to compete with each other for the benefit of consumers instead of forming cartels that control prices to their joint benefit.</p>
<p>Despite the cartel provision, Pitofsky said there are many good points to the tobacco pact. And he said he expected that the FTC and other agencies will have an opportunity to offer testimony on the agreement when it is considered by Congress.</p>
<p>The big tobacco companies agreed last month to a $368.5 billion settlement with a coalition of 40 states that are suing cigarette makers to recover the costs of treating smoking-related health problems.</p>
<p>Under the settlement proposal, tobacco companies would strengthen the health warnings on their packages and change their advertising practices.</p>
<p>But the administration has already found fault with the agreement.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, President Clinton criticized a section of the pact that would curtail the government's hard-won powers to regulate nicotine. Clinton said the proposed settlement ought to be changed because it imposed an &quot;unreasonable restriction&quot; on regulation of tobacco by the federal Food and Drug Administration.</p>
