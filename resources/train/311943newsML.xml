<p>Digital Equipment Corp. said Thursday its profits fell 79 percent in the latest quarter from last year's levels but the results still beat expectations on Wall Street, sending the computer maker's stock sharply higher.</p>
<p>The profit was the first in three quarters for Digital, one of the nation's biggest computer makers, which has suffered from weak sales to corporate customers in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Maynard, Mass.-based Digital said it earned $31.9 million, or 15 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with a profit of $148.8 million, or 91 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter.</p>
<p>Industry analysts had forecast profits of 10 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, and Digital stock jumped $2.50 to $36.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most active issues with more than 4.8 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Sales fell 15 percent to $3.36 billion from $3.95 billion in 1995's second quarter, but were 15 percent higher than Digital's sales in the first quarter of its fiscal year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal was to recover from our first quarter results, grow our revenues sequentially and return to profitability,&quot; Chief Executive Officer Robert Palmer told reporters during a conference call.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm pleased to say that we did accomplish those things ... and I'm confident that we will continue to improve during the second half of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts applauded the return to profitability, but said the computer maker was not out of the woods.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a good news, bad news scenairo,&quot; said Terry Shannon, publisher of the newsletter 'Shannon Knows DEC.' &quot;The good news is they made money. The bad news is they had a significant revenue decline.&quot;</p>
<p>After leading Digital through four years of inconsistent profits, Palmer's job could have been on the line if the company did not earn a profit in the quarter, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think at this juncture, 'Comback Kid' applies more (to Palmer) then it does to Bill Clinton,&quot; Shannon said.</p>
<p>Palmer said Digital's personal computer operations returned to profitability in the quarter after an inventory surplus led to drastic cuts in PC prices a year earlier.</p>
<p>Palmer said the company's Internet software business unit performed well and its semiconductor unit was expected to slowly return to break-even levels by 1998.</p>
<p>Sales of computer systems powered by Digital's fast 64-bit Alpha micprocessor rose 33 percent over the weak first quarter, but grew only 1 percent from the 1995 quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Alpha revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by a temporary supply shortage that led to a shipping shortfall of over $50 million as well as weak performance in Europe,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Vin Mullarkey said.</p>
<p>Digital last week slashed Alpha computer prices by up to 47 percent in a bid to win customers from competitors.</p>
<p>European operations, which accounted for 45 percent of Digital's revenues, got hurt by publicity surrounding its negotiations to restructure operations in France and Germany, Mullarkey said.</p>
<p>An agreement to restructure in one of those two countries, as Digital has done worldwide, was imminent, he said but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>&quot;Because we have been involved in these discussions for an extended period of time to date, we have fallen behind in terms of the restructuring adjustments required,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The slow growth of the economy in Europe and a loss of around $20 million from currency fluctuations also weakened European sales, he said.</p>
