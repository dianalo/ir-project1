<p>*Stocks extend gains by close, lifted by modest bargain hunting after Thursday weakness. Volume 312.94 million shares, value A$652.04 million, 1044 stocks traded, 325 steady, 441 up, 278 down.  </p>
<p>Australian shares extended their gains in the afternoon to close higher on Friday as modest bargain hunting emerged after Thursday's weakness.</p>
<p>At 4.10 p.m. (0510 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was 15.4 points higher at 2,362.1. December share index futures were 15 points up at 2,373, a 10.9 point premium to the index.</p>
<p>Brokers said the return of some buying confidence as investors considered the yields on offer had led to a stronger showing after Thursday's perverse reaction to the local interest rate reduction and Wall Street's surge.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's quite an improvement,&quot; said Robert Cameron of Cameron Securities, adding that the market seemed to be more settled after running ahead of itself prior to Wednesday's rate cut.</p>
<p>&quot;There was probably an overreaction ahead of the interest rate cut. People have settled down and adjusted to it and seen there is still some reasonable yields out there.&quot;</p>
<p>Standouts were few, although listed stockbroker McIntosh Securities caught the eye, jumping 15 cents to A$1.25, its highest level since September 1994, on speculation that U.S. broker Merrill Lynch was eyeing it as a takeover target.  </p>
<p>Near term outlook was seen mixed with much dependent on how the local market would weather a Wall Street correcting from its current record levels.</p>
<p>Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about eight to five, while about 31 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>FUTURES/OPTIONS - Both options and futures trade was at moderate levels only, reflecting the mixed outlook for the underlying market. Total options traded 38,139 (36,672)</p>
<p>Turnover in December SPI contracts totalled 4,152 (8,846)  </p>
<p>In other local markets, Australian bonds drifted quietly towards the weekend to end just above this week's 32-month yield lows.</p>
<p>By 5.00 p.m. (0600 GMT), 10 year T-bills were yielding 7.205 percent.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar finished Friday at three month lows as signs of a seismic shift in the Japanese stance on the yen and interest rates struck fear into the heart of high yielding currencies everywhere.</p>
<p>By 5.00 p.m. (0600 GMT), the local currency was quoted at US$0.7835/40.  </p>
