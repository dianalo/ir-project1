<p>ASEAN's annual foreign ministers' meeting ran overtime on Friday as the group tried to understand the latest statement from Phnom Penh over its offer to mediate in strife-torn Cambodia, delegates said.</p>
<p>The ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) had asked for the latest statement from Cambodian strongman Hun Sen to be faxed to them, a senior official attending the meeting said.</p>
<p>The official closing ceremony, to have been held at four p.m. (0800 GMT), was delayed while the ministers tried to decide what to say about the Cambodian crisis in their final communique.</p>
<p>Hun Sen said on Friday that ASEAN's role in Cambodia was to &quot;prevent foreign interference&quot; in Cambodian affairs.</p>
<p>His statement said Cambodia itself would solve its internal problems based on the 1991 Paris peace accords and its constitution.</p>
<p>It was the latest twist in a Cambodian position that has foreign ministers and officials scratching their heads.</p>
<p>Hun Sen on Thursday said he welcomed an ASEAN role in mediating the conflict and was not particularly troubled that the grouping had delayed Cambodia's admission.</p>
<p>Cambodia was supposed to join, along with Burma and Laos, at a special ceremony on Wednesday, but ASEAN postponed its membership indefinitely after Hun Sen's coup against First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in early July.</p>
<p>Hun Sen then abruptly dismissed a mediation offer by a delegation of three ASEAN foreign ministers who visited Phnom Penh last weekend.</p>
