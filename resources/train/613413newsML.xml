<p>Mining deals struck with what used to be Zaire will have to be renegotiated with the new government, the mining minister of Lauren Kabila's Democratic Republic of Congo said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;If there were agreements with the previous government, we will accept them but on condition they are ratified, they must therefore be renegotiated because we do not know exactly under what conditions all these accords were signed,&quot; Matutulo Kambale told state television.</p>
<p>&quot;Our mining policy is simple. We bring in people asking them to respect the cardinal principles -- no monopoly,&quot; he said, during an interview with the television network.</p>
<p>He said the new administration, formed after Kabila's forces deposed veteran dictator Mobutu Sese Seko on May 17, wanted to develop the wealth of Africa's third largest nation from using their own resources.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not go begging from the outside (world),&quot; he said, but he added that they wanted to attract a maximum of foreign investors by offering concessions on the right terms.</p>
<p>Zaire, with significant reserves of copper, cobalt, gold, diamonds and other minerals, is potentially one of Africa's richest nations. Under Mobutu, its national wealth was stolen or squandered in a morass of corruption and administrative chaos.</p>
