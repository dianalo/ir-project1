<p>Frederick Chiluba was sworn in for a second term as Zambia's president on Thursday after dismissing opposition charges that he rigged his landslide re-election.</p>
<p>He issued a clear warning to disgruntled opposition parties that the southern African country's security forces would be on the alert for any political unrest.</p>
<p>Election officials said results from 138 of the country's 150 constituencies gave Chiluba roughly 70 percent of the 1.19 million ballots counted.</p>
<p>Monday's poll was boycotted by major opposition parties, including that of former president Kenneth Kaunda, who was barred from contesting the poll by a controversial new law.</p>
<p>Not all results were in by the time the diminutive Chiluba, 53, took the oath of office in front of the country's most senior judge at the Supreme Court building in Lusaka.</p>
<p>Top brass from the army and police force attended the ceremony in dress uniform, while the dark-suited Chiluba swore to uphold the law of the land.</p>
<p>In a speech, Chiluba said the security forces would ensure there was no trouble in Zambia, where opposition supporters have demonstrated to protest what they saw as flawed polls.</p>
<p>Some Chiluba opponents have called for a campaign of civil disobedience to protest against the election. Chiluba's closest rival, Zambia Democratic Congress leader Dean Mungomba, advised foreigners to leave the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We are merely asking them to take cover because our next course of action is not likely to be peaceful,&quot; Mungomba said.</p>
<p>Chiluba cautioned opponents: &quot;The army is...alert, and very alert, ready and willing to reinforce the police and air force.&quot; &quot;They are not only in the rearguard, they are very much in the forefront to ensure that peace is maintained in the nation, on the borders and everywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;The police and every law enforcement agency must make sure that everyone of us, without exception, is made to obey and observe the requirements of the law.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States said it regretted Kaunda's exclusion from the election and the legislation by which Chiluba's government had &quot;limited the rights of the Zambian people to choose their leaders freely&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We urge the government of Zambia to begin demonstrating, at the earliest opportunity, a strengthened commitment to political and economic reform processes that have been under way since 1991,&quot; the U.S. Embassy in Lusaka said in a statement.</p>
<p>In Dublin, the 15-member European Union said it regretted that Zambia's elections were not held on a basis acceptable to all parties and was concerned about the risk of &quot;a further decline in the previous standards of governance&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Union looks to the Zambian government to reinvigorate the political and economic reform programme,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Chiluba last week rejected a public call from South African President Nelson Mandela to delay the elections in the interests of peace and reconciliation.</p>
<p>In Thursday's re-inauguration speech, he said: &quot;We shall never do anything to threaten the interests of our neighbours. By the same token, we shall not accept anything that threatens our interests here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will not talk about whether the elections were free and fair. We all know they were transparent.&quot;</p>
