<p>An Israeli army war game found Palestinian and Israeli casualties would be in the thousands if Israel re-took areas under PLO rule, local media said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;From the simulation it arose...hundreds of Israeli soldiers would be killed and thousands wounded. The Palestinians...would suffer thousands killed from amidst the Palestinian police and the civilian population,&quot; Israel's Maariv daily said.</p>
<p>Israel, in deals signed by its prior dovish government, has handed over most of the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank to PLO rule since 1994.</p>
<p>Maariv and the daily Yedioth Ahronoth said the army general staff concluded from the war game conducted one month ago that while re-occupying PLO areas was possible it was not the preferred response to an outbreak of hostilities.</p>
<p>Army spokesmen refused to comment on the reports.</p>
<p>Tension has been high between the sides since March when Israel launched a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, a move Palestinians viewed as pre-empting final peace talks.</p>
<p>The dailies said right-wing legislator Uzi Landau, who is head of parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, and left-wing legislator Uzi Baram attended the war game.</p>
<p>Baram refused to comment on the reports to Reuters.</p>
<p>Landau, of Likud, told Israel's army radio he would neither confirm nor deny the reports. But he added: &quot;The fact that our re-entry into the Palestinian cities could entail a not small cost is not something that should be surprising.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is not in Israel's interest to get up one fine day, mobilise and attempt to re-enter the Palestinian cities. But it must be no less clear...the Palestinians cannot feel as if we would not allow ourselves the necessary operations in their territory, including entering wide parts of Area A,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Area A&quot; designates territory under Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) control.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposed the peace deals, handed over most of the city of Hebron, fulfilling a commitment made by the administration he ousted in May 1996 elections.</p>
<p>His green light for the East Jerusalem settlement building plunged negotiations with the Palestinians into deep crisis. Palestinian anger has erupted periodically into clashes between Israeli troops firing rubber bullets and stone-throwing Palestinian demonstrators.</p>
<p>But the scenario the Israeli generals fear is a repeat of fighting like that of September 1996 when Palestinian police firing automatic weapons were drawn into the unrest. Sixty-one Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>In September, Israel revealed it had activated the first phase of &quot;Operation Field of Thorns&quot;, a plan whose final third stage is the retaking of areas handed to the PLO.</p>
<p>Maariv said given the likely toll of re-taking PLO areas -- and the damage such bloodshed would cause Israel internationally and with Arab states in particular -- the army preferred other means if fighting broke out with Palestinian forces.</p>
<p>Those measures would include hermetically sealing off the areas, massively reinforcing points of friction and deploying helicopter gunships and snipers.</p>
