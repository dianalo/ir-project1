<p>Romania's tourism ministry will privatise dozens of hotels and restaurants to rejuvenate a tourism industry marked by decrepit facilities and sub-standard service.</p>
<p>A list presented this week by the ministry contained 53 companies to be turned over to the private sector as part of efforts to bring visitors and major Western tour operators back to the Balkan country.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major attempt to end footdragging in privatising the tourism sector,&quot; Sevastita Radulescu, a spokeswoman for the ministry said by telephone on Thursday.</p>
<p>Radulescu said about a third of the firms shortlisted were hotels built in the early 1980s in Black Sea resorts. Other firms on the list were restaurants and hotels in mountain spas or in towns with tourist potential.</p>
<p>&quot;The offer is interesting. Our hope is to attract some serious foreign investors,&quot; Radulescu said, adding that the ministry was considering plans to call an international tender for the sell-off.</p>
<p>Romania drew large numbers of tourists from Germany, France and Scandinavia up until the mid-1980s when it suffered food and power shortages and dictator Nicolae Ceausescu cut operating hours for bars and leisure centres.</p>
<p>Statistics issued last month showed 58 percent of the 2.8 million tourists who visited Romania last year came from poorer Moldova, Hungary, Ukraine and Bulgaria. The largest contingent of Western tourists came from Germany, 5.07 percent, followed by Italy with 2.45 percent.</p>
<p>The country's holiday spots are endowed with some of the least spoiled Alpine slopes or beaches in Europe. But tourists must cope with potholed roads, poor accommodation and bad communications.</p>
<p>Data shows tourism accounts for only two percent of Romania's gross domestic product while real privatisation in the sector amounts to a mere 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>Privatisation was almost halted under the former leftist government, ousted in elections last November, which used substitutes including partial management-buyouts or long-term rental contracts.</p>
<p>Administrators have been reluctant to invest in assets they do not own. Run-down hotels and pubs are a common sight across Romania while private hotels are very rare.</p>
<p>&quot;One can forget about a broken television set, but will always remember lousy service,&quot; a sector analyst said.</p>
<p>Tourism Minister Akos Birtalan has pledged to bring the sector on a free market footing.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to privatise fast. This is the only chance to revive the sector and we have to move fast,&quot; he said recently.</p>
<p>Radulescu also said the ministry had completed evaluation of the assets of the 53 firms earmarked for privatisation and as well as the legal steps needed to start the process.</p>
