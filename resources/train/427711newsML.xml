<p>Shock turned to anger in Belgium on Friday as the country -- already rocked by a paedophile scandal -- prepared to go into mourning for the third time in six months over the death of another young girl.</p>
<p>&quot;Key information neglected for four years,&quot; said De Standaard newspaper.</p>
<p>The body of Loubna Benaissa, aged nine when she disappeared in August 1992 while shopping for yoghurt for her mother, was discovered late on Wednesday in a trunk in the basement of a garage in the Brussels neighbourhood where she lived.</p>
<p>Patrick Derochette, a convicted violent child molester, was charged on Thursday with abduction, rape of a child under 10 years of age and illegal imprisonment leading to death.</p>
<p>A funeral service will be held for Loubna, whose family is Moroccan, on Saturday morning in Brussels' Islamic centre. Her body will then be flown to Tangiers. Large crowds are expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Too many deficiencies: Anger covers the grief for Loubna,&quot; said Le Soir newspaper. &quot;For four years, Loubna was just next door,&quot; said La Libre Belgique.</p>
<p>Nabela, Loubna's 17-year-old sister who has captured the country's hearts with her quiet dignity, said she was deeply hurt and angry.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day for four years we walked past Loubna,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;When they finally found her it was too late.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday night a crowd of angry Moroccan youths gathered outside the town hall of the Brussels suburb of Ixelles where the Benaissa family lives, chanting and throwing stones.</p>
<p>It could have turned ugly but Nabela spoke to the crowd asking for one minute's silence in Loubna's memory and that they should disperse out of respect for the family.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck admitted there seemed to have been serious flaws in the police investigations into Loubna's disappearance, and newspapers revealed that the garage had been searched at least three times in 1992 and 1996.</p>
<p>The discovery of Loubna's body brought to five the number of dead young girls found in Belgium since last August when another convicted paedophile, Marc Dutroux, was arrested.</p>
<p>Two young, sexually-abused girls were rescued from a dungeon in the basement of one of Dutroux' houses and the bodies of four more were unearthed on two other properties either owned by or connected with him. Dutroux has been charged with murder.</p>
<p>Two of the girls, eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo were buried together in what amounted to a state funeral. The two others, An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, were buried separately but on the same day.</p>
<p>There have been growing allegations of official protection for Dutroux, a theme that a special parliamentary commission has increasingly focused on since it began investigating bungled police investigations five months ago.</p>
<p>On Thursday the commission, which had been due to report on March 15, was given an extra month to pursue its inquiries.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday the parents of the dead girls and of several other missing children visited the Benaissa family as did the members of the parliamentary commission. They are expected to attend the funeral on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police have not established any links between Dutroux and Derochette.</p>
