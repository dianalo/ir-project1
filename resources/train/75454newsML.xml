<p>The Islamic movement Hamas said on Wednesday Jordanian authorities had arrested one of its senior members in a crackdown aimed at weakening its influence in the kingdom and placating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>A Hamas official said eight other men, including a newspaper editor, a university teacher, a student and the head of a hospital nursing department, had been detained in the last week.</p>
<p>&quot;These arrests have taken place suddenly and at Jordan's initiative,&quot; a senior Hamas official who asked not to be named told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of the arrests is to please the government of Benjamin Netanyahu by striking at the political structure of the Hamas movement which has been based in Jordan for a number of years, in agreement with the previous government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jordanian officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The Hamas source said the wave of arrests began one week ago. The latest detainee was Abdel-Aziz al-Amri, described as a Hamas politburo member and general manager of the London based Islamist magazine Moslem Palestine.</p>
<p>He was arrested in Amman on Wednesday, the source said.</p>
<p>Last week Jordan's Islamic parliamentary party said intelligence services had detained and tortured a Hamas supporter for two weeks.</p>
<p>Jordan denies its security forces torture detainees.</p>
<p>It signed a peace treaty two years ago with Israel and has come under pressure from both the Jewish state and Palestinian authorities to shut down any Hamas activity on its territory.</p>
<p>Hamas, an offshoot of the Moslem Brotherhood Movement, is a social and religious organisation with branches across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A militant Hamas cell carried out a wave of suicide attacks in Israel this year killing dozens of people.</p>
<p>The Hamas source said the group had reached agreement with previous Jordanian governments that its presence in Jordan would be limited to political and promotional activities.</p>
<p>Jordan says Hamas has no formal legal presence in the country. But it says the government is unable to prevent Jordanian citizens expressing strong opposition to Israel.</p>
