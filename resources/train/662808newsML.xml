<p>African youth champions Morocco overcame an early setback against host nation Malaysia to win the opening game of the World Youth Cup 3-1 on Monday.</p>
<p>Watched by a 30,000 home crowd in a 80,000 capacity stadium just outside Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia seized the lead in the 11th minute when Youssef Safri deflected a free kick by Burhan Azmir past his own goalkeeper.</p>
<p>But Africa's number one team swiftly equalised, with  Tarik Sektioui silencing the home fans by side-footing the ball in from six metres after 14 minutes.</p>
<p>A 31st minute strike by defender Khalid Khamma after Mounir Haddaji had evaded the hosts offside trap put the Moroccans in front.</p>
<p>Malaysia were close to salvaging a draw when a late free kick from Gilbert Cassedy grazed the crossbar and, seconds later, Moroccan goalkeeper Tarik El Jarmouni denied Chow Chee Weng.</p>
<p>Aissam Barroudi wrapped up Morocco's victory with a 90th minute strike.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not an easy game,&quot; said Moroccan coach Rachid Taoussi. &quot;We were playing the host nation and they will always be highly motivated.</p>
<p>&quot;We had trouble with the weather and the climate -- it is very hot and humid. These are not excuses for our performance, which was generally a good one,&quot; he said.</p>
