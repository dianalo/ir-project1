<p>German overnight funds nudged fractionally higher again on Thursday despite a sharp increase in reserve holdings as dealers anticipated a jump in demand for cash before upcoming summer vacations.</p>
<p>Call money rates jumped back above the Bundesbank's main money market rate of three percent to spend Thursday morning trading between 3.00/02 percent after having traded between 2.97/3.00 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers explained they expected demand for cash to jump as schools are to let out for the summer in several states.  </p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the Bundesbank tried to preempt any further tightening by injecting a net 6.6 billion marks into the system at Wednesday's weekly repo award,&quot; a dealer said. Although dealers realised the market was short large sums of money to meet its monthly reserve requirements and had hoped for a generous injection, they were surprised by the sum.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it is more clear why the Bundesbank did this though,&quot; a dealer added.</p>
<p>Dealers were now rather unsure of where rates might go this afternoon as the market was still preparing for month-end.  </p>
<p>Banks held 46.7 billion marks in reserve compared with 41.9 billion marks held on Tuesday. The monthly average was at 40.4 billion marks only slightly up from 40.1 billion marks one day earlier.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average was set at 3.03067 percent on Thursday compared with 3.03600 percent on Wednesday.</p>
