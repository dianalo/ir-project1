<p>Top seed Goran Ivanisevic withdrew from the European Community tennis championship on Tuesday due to a shoulder injury, only hours after German Boris Becker had pulled out from the same event.</p>
<p>&quot;It's official, (Ivanisevic) is out with tendinitis in his left shoulder,&quot; an ATP spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Croat, a wild card entry and former winner in Antwerp, went to see the doctor after playing a doubles match in Antwerp on Tuesday evening, she said.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic, beaten by Austrian Thomas Muster in the final of the Dubai Open last Sunday, was due to play Frenchman Guy Forget in a first-round match on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He will be replaced by Belgian lucky loser Filip Dewulf.</p>
<p>Fourth seed Becker, dogged by tendinitis in his wrist, earlier suffered a similar fate.</p>
<p>The German, who had pulled out in Dubai just before his quarter-final against Ivanisevic, said he had been able to practise for only 35 minutes on Tuesday because of the pain.</p>
<p>Becker, who was to have played Czech Petr Korda in the first round of the Antwerp event on Wednesday, will be replaced by another lucky loser, Dennis van Scheppingen of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>He said he was hoping to resume practising this weekend and take part in the Italian Indoor tournament in Milan.</p>
