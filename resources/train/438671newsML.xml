<p>A Brazilian soccer coach, furious at refereeing decision against his team, ran on to the pitch to argue with the referee and dropped his trousers, revealing his buttocks.</p>
<p>Itaperuna coach Paulo Mata was incensed the referee allowed a late Vasco da Gama goal to stand and then sent off three Itaperuna players in the closing minute of their Rio de Janeiro championship match on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Itaperuna players protested that Vasco da Gama striker Edmundo was offside when scored the winning goal and lost their heads, committing a serious of reckless tackles on their opponents.</p>
<p>After the third sending-off, Mata rushed on to the pitch, pulled off his shirt and ran towards the referee.</p>
<p>He was stopped by three policemen but Mata, who by this time had his back to the television cameras, then dropped his trousers. Police forced him to pull them up again and Mata was led off the pitch, ranting at the officials.</p>
<p>&quot;I went naked because I'm tired of working honestly only be scandalously robbed,&quot; he said later. &quot;Football in Rio de Janeiro is a disgrace. I'm going to fulfil my agreement with Itaperuna and then I'm packing it in.&quot;</p>
<p>Itaperuna, who barely managed to raise a team in time for the tournament, had fought back from two goals down before Edmundo gave Vasco, one of the four top-class teams in the tournament, a 3-2 win.</p>
