<p>Foreign investors fighting for board representation at Novolipetsk, one of Russia's largest firms, said on Thursday they hoped the struggle would soon be over.</p>
<p>Outside shareholders who own 40 percent of Novolipetsk Metallurgical Plant say they have been locked out of rooms, found offices closed on their arrival and have been forcibly escorted from the factory.</p>
<p>In what is seen as an acid test of investor rights in Russia, three major shareholders are suing the company. Its management, which claims the outsiders broke the rules on requesting representation, will meet them in the arbitration court on April 16. The company says it has done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no problem,&quot; board chairman Vladimir Skorokhodov told a news conference this month.</p>
<p>&quot;There are certain rules which govern how investors are supposed to apply to sit on the board of directors. According to existing laws those rules were broken (by investors). As to how right or wrong (our) decision was, the court will judge.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Sputnik Fund, an investment arm of Renaissance Capital investment bank which owns nine percent of Novolipetsk and is one of three groups suing said cases like these were usually resolved at hearings of this sort, although it could take longer.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all coming to fruition very quickly,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The problems at Novolipetsk, which have lasted for more than a year, have attracted attention from former economics minister Yevgeny Yasin, now a minister co-ordinating government policy.</p>
<p>Other ministers, aware that complaints about problems with shareholder rights are frightening investors away from Russia, have promised to do more to protect shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;Companies which infringe shareholders' rights will not get government support,&quot; deputy economy minister Sergei Vasilyev told a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>The other two shareholders involved in the battle for representation, U.S. investment fund Cambridge Capital Management and MFK bank, a subsidiary of Russia's Uneximbank, hold stakes of 17.2 percent and 15 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Novolipetsk, located about 400 km south of Moscow in Lipetsk, produced some seven million tonnes of steel in 1996 and 1995, according to company figures quoted by Itar-Tass news agency.</p>
<p>Creditanstalt investment bank calculated its market capitalisation at $270 million, though its shares are rarely traded, and said it had revenues of $2 billion in 1995 and about the same in 1996.</p>
<p>Sputnik has filed a separate suit over alleged obstructions, the spokesman said, and the regional property fund has sued in support of MFK's claim that plant management illegally stripped it of it voting rights at a shareholders meeting in May 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;It became clear to the Sputnik Fund and the representatives of the other investors that they were being actively barred from submitting their candidates,&quot; said the Sputnik representative, who said he had been authorised to speak for all three groups.</p>
<p>The Federal Securities Commission (FSC), Russia's market watchdog, is investigating the battle, but an FSC spokeswoman said the state lacks the legal power to force management to act.</p>
<p>&quot;If a company like that violates the law on securities, the commission can make a recommendation to the court, but according to the criminal code the company is not punishable,&quot; said Kristen Staples, the FSC's Director of Communications.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very frustrating for all involved.&quot;</p>
