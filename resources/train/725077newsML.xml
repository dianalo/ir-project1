<title>UK: GOLF-HOCH PULLS OUT OF BRITISH OPEN AGAIN.</title>
<headline>GOLF-HOCH PULLS OUT OF BRITISH OPEN AGAIN.</headline>
<dateline>TROON, Scotland 1997-07-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>World number 14 Scott Hoch, who was roundly criticised by his compatriots when he withdrew from the British Open last year, has done it again.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old American sent a letter of withdrawal to the Royal and Ancient Club, who stage the Open, saying he would not be able to play at Royal Troon this week.</p>
<p>Hoch has always steadfastly maintained he does not like the event but several compatriots, notably Davis Love, criticised him when he withdrew at Royal Lytham last year when, like this year, he was also exempt from final qualifying.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to a change in my personal schedule, I will be unable to participate in this year's British Open Championship. Please accept this letter as an official withdrawal of my earlier application,&quot; his letter said.</p>
<p>Hoch, sixth on this year's U.S. money list and almost certain to be on the U.S. Ryder Cup team this year, played at St Andrews in 1990 and missed the halfway cut.</p>
<p>His next appearance was back at St Andrews in 1995 and he finished joint 66th.</p>
<p>He left with such a poor opinion of the Old Course that he insisted he would not return for the Millennium Open there in 2000 &quot;even if I am fit and able.&quot;</p>
