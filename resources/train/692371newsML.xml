<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-06-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>SIMEX Brent crude futures firmed on Friday as the market settled back into a range trading pattern following OPEC inspired volatility.</p>
<p>August Brent crude futures on SIMEX were last traded at $17.94 per barrel, up nine cents from London.</p>
<p>Brokers said Brent had risen and then fallen on changing attitudes to OPEC.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the group agreed to roll over its supply ceiling of 25.033 million barrels per day and said members had pledged quota adherence, which would have wiped almost two million bpd from global supply.  </p>
<p>But the bullish signs were overtaken by scepticism that OPEC could keep quota busters in line.</p>
<p>Now, the Brent contract was likely to settle back into a range of $17.50/$18.00, brokers said.</p>
<p>August NYMEX crude prices on ACCESS were last traded at $19.16 per barrel, up seven cents from New York, where the contract fell 43 cents to settle at $19.09.</p>
