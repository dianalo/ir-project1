<p>An envoy of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd arrived in Tehran on Tuesday on a rare visit by a Saudi official to Iran, the latest attempt to improve ties between two of the world's biggest oil producers.</p>
<p>The official Iranian news agency IRNA said Minister of State Abdul-Aziz bin Abdullah al-Khoweiter would deliver messages from King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is due to hand over his post to president-elect Mohammad Khatami in August.</p>
<p>&quot;Asked about the content of the messages, the Saudi state minister said that both deal with expansion of relations between the two Moslem countries,&quot; IRNA added.</p>
<p>It said Khoweiter would leave Tehran later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Saudi Arabia said the visit was a new sign of a thaw in icy ties between the two regional powerhouses whose cooperation is seen as vital for stability in a region that sits on more than two thirds of the world's oil reserves.</p>
<p>Ties have often been tense since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, mainly over the presence of Western forces in the Gulf, the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca, Iran's arms programme and charges that it meddles in its neighbours' internal affairs.</p>
<p>Shi'ite Iran denies the charges and its leaders have repeatedly said they want to rebuild trust with their mostly Sunni Moslem Arab neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;Relations are definitely warming up, but they still have a long way to go,&quot; one Western diplomat in Riyadh said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iranians appear serious in trying to establish better relations and the Saudis have indicated they are willing to meet them half way,&quot; another diplomat said.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states still view the Tehran government with suspicion, the diplomats said.</p>
<p>But Iran had to prove to its neighbour -- the world's largest oil exporter and Washington's main ally in the Gulf -- that it was serious in opening a new chapter in ties, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran will have to work hard at allaying these worries and that does not happen overnight,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
<p>The United States accuses Iran of sponsoring state &quot;terrorism&quot; and has expressed concern about what it describes as Iran's growing military capability and its aims in the region.</p>
<p>Iran, which denies the terrorism charges, opposes the U.S. military presence in the Gulf and says Washington falsely accuses Tehran of threatening regional security in order to scare its Gulf Arab allies into buying more American weapons.</p>
<p>The diplomats said another thorny issue was whether Iran was involved in a bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen in eastern Saudi Arabia last June. Saudi officials have refused to confirm U.S. media reports of an Iranian link.</p>
<p>The media in Iran, which denies links to the attack, has praised Riyadh for not implicating Iran.</p>
<p>One diplomat said the fact that Saudi Arabia and Iran set aside their political rivalries at last week's Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna was &quot;interesting&quot;.</p>
<p>The two joined forces to put pressure on those others among the 11 members who are violating mandatory oil output limits and extract promises of better behaviour from them.</p>
<p>The diplomats said Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states would be watching for any steps towards better ties after Khatami takes office in August.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia had congratulated Khatami and both he and King Fahd said they hoped for a new chapter in relations.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani and Crown Prince Abdullah held talks in Pakistan on the sidelines of an Islamic summit in March and Iran said Crown Prince Abdullah said he would attend an Islamic summit due to be held in Tehran in December.</p>
<p>The same month, Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said his visit to Saudi as part of a Gulf tour opened up a new chapter in relations.</p>
