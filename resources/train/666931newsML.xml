<p>President Clinton Tuesday marked the 25th anniversary of a landmark law that opened doors for women in education, sports and hiring by expanding its reach and ordering strengthened enforcement.</p>
<p>Clinton said the law, known as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, had had a beneficial effect on every American. &quot;If we've learned anything in the last 25 years since Title IX became law, it is that expanding benefits and opportunities for any American helps the rest of us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An Education Department report issued in conjunction with the anniversary of Title IX showed its profound effect over the last quarter century. As many U.S. women as men now receive college degrees and more than 100,000 women take part in inter-collegiate sports, a four-fold increase since 1971.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we celebrate how far we've come. But we must also recommit ourselves to Title IX's goal of equality in education, for too many schools and education programmes still drag their feet and lag behind in their responsibility to our young women and girls,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>A backlash against the law has developed in some areas, with some schools dropping less popular sports for men and women and putting even greater emphasis on cash-cow sports such as football favoured by alumni.</p>
<p>Directing federal departments and agencies to review and improve their enforcement plans, the president added: &quot;Every school and every education programme that receives federal assistance in the entire country must understand that complying with Title IX is not optional. It is the law.&quot;</p>
<p>A number of pioneering women attended the White House ceremony, including astronaut Sally Ride, the first American woman to fly in space, and six-time Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of Title IX, I am here,&quot; said Joyner-Kersee, noting that an athletic scholarship had enabled her to get a college education.</p>
<p>&quot;Think what we would be like if there were no Sally Rides or Jackie Joyner-Kersees, or any one of the countless women whose contributions have helped to make our nation a better place,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>As part of the anniversary celebration, he moved to close a legal loophole exempting the military academies and other government education programmes from requirements of Title IX.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry conceded this was more symbolic than substantive since most such programmes already comply. &quot;The president's point is that that they ought to live under the same letter of the law that other ... schools do.&quot;</p>
