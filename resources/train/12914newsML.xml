<p>APEC officials say they have taken the first steps to integrate their 18 diverse Pacific Rim economies but warned against expecting early success in the goal of setting up the world's largest free trade region.</p>
<p>Delegates to a senior officials meeting of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) which just ended in the southern Philippine city of Davao said they were satisfied with their three-day talks but thoughts of the long haul ahead tempered optimism.</p>
<p>&quot;You all should keep in mind that this is the first step on a journey that will roll over for a number of years... A good start has been made,&quot; U.S. delegation head John Wolf said at the weekend.</p>
<p>The meeting was part of a series of talks to flesh out the Osaka Action agenda, unveiled last November in Japan, in time for the fourth summit of APEC leaders in November in the Philippines.</p>
<p>APEC energy ministers and the region's businessmen are expected to meet in Sydney this week to discuss the role of private investment in the expanding energy industries of Asia.</p>
<p>The action agenda is a general framework for a free trade regime APEC hopes to set up by the year 2010 for developed member-economies and year 2020 for developing economies.</p>
<p>&quot;Expectation ought not to be unbounded. One shouldn't expect to see the whole roadmap from now to 2010 and 2020,&quot; Wolf said.</p>
<p>&quot;The work still needs some distance to go... But all the signs point to a very positive direction,&quot; said Canadian chief delegate Leonard Edwards.</p>
<p>The 18 economies in the APEC forum produce more than half the world's gross domestic product and contribute 46 percent of world merchandise exports.</p>
<p>So far, member-economies have submitted the first revisions to their individual voluntary tariff reduction programmes.</p>
<p>U.S. Assistant Trade Representative for Asia Pacific Robert Cassidy said commitments made by members in their tariff schemes were still not satisfactory. But he said he was pleased every economy was willing to improve its offer.</p>
<p>Conference chairman Federico Macaranas of the Philippines said many economies had submitted action plans beyond what they committed in the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;That alone is reason for our saying we really have advanced the APEC process,&quot; he said. He likened the talks to solving a jigsaw puzzle where everyone wanted to start with his own piece.</p>
<p>New Zealand's Christopher Butler, chairman of the committee on trade and investment, said members had agreed to align domestic standards with international norms by the year 2005 which will sharply cut the cost of cross-border trading.</p>
<p>But collective action plans on intellectual property rights, deregulation, rules of origin, government procurement and dispute mediation have yet to be finalised.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a journey of a week or a month or a year. It's a journey of 14 to 24 years. So, there is a need to be realistic about how much gets done within the year,&quot; Butler said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you look at what (it) has achieved relative to international benchmarks, it is quite extraordinary as to how far APEC has come.&quot;</p>
<p>Delegates deflected a U.S. attempt to steamroll approval of an accord to bring down tariffs on information technology and telecommunication products to zero percent by year 2000. They referred the question to a committee for further study.</p>
<p>They also tossed the issue of new members to another meeting.</p>
<p>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Chile, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and the United States.</p>
