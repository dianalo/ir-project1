<p>Troubled auto lender Mercury Finance Co. said Thursday its creditors granted waivers allowing a 90-day extension of its $50 million line of credit with Bank of America to June 10.</p>
<p>The waivers permit Mercury, which faces a federal investigation, to continue to pledge assets as collateral on the $50 million credit facility. The previous waiver period had been only for 30 days, Chicago-based Mercury said.</p>
<p>The company also has been hit by several shareholder lawsuits, had to restate its financial results to show lower earnings due to accounting irregularities, and lost more than $2 billion in market capitalisation after a plunge in its stock price.</p>
<p>The stock fell in January after the news of the earnings restatement from $14 to less than $2 per share. It rose 50 cents to $3 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;This 90-day extension is a tangible demonstration of confidence in Mercury,&quot; said Chief Executive William Brandt.</p>
<p>&quot;The expanded waiver period gives the company breathing room to focus on operations and on the exploration of long-term financing alternatives,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the waivers, during the 90-day period, the company will resume interest payments on nearly all of its roughly $1 billion in debt and will pay any interest that is now past due, Mercury said.</p>
<p>Mercury received the $50 million in short-term financing from Bank of America a month ago. The financing is being used to meet daily operating expenses and interest payments.</p>
