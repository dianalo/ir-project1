<p>China should be cautious in approving new foreign-funded projects to avoid undermining domestic industry and prevent foreign monopolies, the official media reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Beijing also needed to manage its foreign debt more effectively and should fix quotas for offshore convertible debt of domestic companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Blindly introducing such funds and ineffective management may lead to disastrous results such as a debt crisis and the monopoly of domestic industries by multinational companies,&quot; the official China Daily quoted He Ju of the State Planning Commission as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The approval of projects must be conducted in a very strict and cautious manner,&quot; said the official, who is deputy director of the commission's department of foreign capital utilisation.</p>
<p>Chinese firms should use overseas capital to improve their goods and compete better in international markets.</p>
<p>The Financial Daily quoted a State Planning Commission official as saying that foreign debt had to be carefully managed and that management should cover convertible bonds and project loans. The official was not named.  </p>
<p>China should eventually look to its huge personal savings rate to drive economic growth, the newspapers said. China's personal savings stood at nearly 3.8 trillion yuan ($457 billion) at the end of October.</p>
<p>Firms using overseas capital should set up debt repayment funds and reserves and diversify financial instruments to offset risks in interest payments and currency fluctuations, according to the official newspapers.</p>
<p>China has previously announced foreign debt of $109.5 billion as of the end of June.</p>
