<p>French shares closed just above the 2,300 level after having given up much of the day's earlier gains and with heavy basket trades in late afternoon when the U.S. market opened and foreign investors made their moves.</p>
<p>Overall volume remained very modest as many European operators were still on Christmas holidays, with London and Frankfurt closed.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 14.20 points or 0.62 percent at 2,303.75 while the CAC-40 futures contract was up 17 at 2,304. Volume was 2.37 billion francs, including foreign shares, of which 1.42 billion in blue chip shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today there really was nothing going on,&quot; a dealer said, adding Friday's trade would be more active as London would re-open. Thursday's high was at 2,310.95, the low at 2.286.49.</p>
<p>Today's rise in the CAC-40 index to above 2,300 brings the French market back to a level surrendered on December 5 when the index was coming down from a year-high at 2,358.65, reached on December 3 on the eve of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in the share market. The remarks prompted a Wall Street sell-off.</p>
<p>The index is currently on an uptrend started at the December 13 close of 2,203.41.  </p>
<p>On Friday there will be some U.S. data with at 1330 GMT the November durable goods orders, expected to show an 0.1 percent rise, and jobless claims which are seen at a 346,000 rise.</p>
<p>Later at 2130 GMT the money supply figures will be released.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Bank de France's monetary policy council met and left the key rate unchanged at 3.15 percent.</p>
<p>The French government is expected to decide on January 3 on replacements for two members of the Bank of France's monetary policy council (CPM) whose mandate expires in January, council member Paul Marchelli said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>* Peugeot, down 1.82 percent at 593 francs, weak in empty market. Renault unchanged at 112 francs.</p>
<p>&quot;There is really nothing happening,&quot; said a broker, adding there were no stories about Peugeot in the market.</p>
<p>Peugeot's share price has been rising from 562 francs on December 18 to 604 on December 24, after a fall from 642 francs on November 29. It hit a year low of 520 francs on October 31.</p>
<p>* Seita was down 1.36 percent at 217 francs in a small volume of 16,782 shares after a second civil suit had been lodged by a lawyer for the family of a smoker who had died of lung cancer. Seita said the legal action was groundless.  </p>
<p>* A block trade of 1.036 million shares in the Union Pour Le Financement de l'Immeuble de Societes (UIS) took place at 170 francs per share immediately after the opening. This represents seven percent of the share capital. The company was not available for comment. The share closed up 0.52 pct at 173.70 francs. &quot;We have been contacted by the SBF (Paris Bourse) to inform us about the block trade but I am not in a position to give you any comment,&quot; a UIS employee said. UIS is indirectly controlled by insurer GAN, which has 13.39 percent via its Gan Incendie Accidents unit, 29.55 percent through GAN Vie and 40.17 percent via UIC.  </p>
