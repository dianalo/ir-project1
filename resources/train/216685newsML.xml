<p>British financial markets gave a cool reception to finance minister Kenneth Clarke's 1997/98 budget on Tuesday, unconvinced it would achieve his aim of reducing the risk of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Shares ended higher but off pre-budget highs, government bonds finished lower while sterling was sturdy. The speech delivered the expected one percentage point cut in the basic rate of income tax but cut the forecast for government borrowing needs in 1997/98 by a surprising large amount.</p>
<p>&quot;It is politically astute and in the main, financially sound, but the budget is unlikely to deter speculation that another rate hike is just a matter of time,&quot; Rob Hayward, economist at BankAmerica in London, said.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news is that the budget provides for fiscal tightening, the bad news is that it does not do enough.&quot;</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed up 13.8 points or 0.34 percent on the day at 4,068.4 but off 4,086.6 as Clarke started his speech. December FTSE futures were quoted at 4,095.0, up 29.0 points versus 4,108.0 before the speech.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index had surged to an all-time high of 4,094.4 at the opening on Wall Street's record breaking performance on Monday.</p>
<p>The 10-year benchmark gilt was quoted at 100.44 for a yield of 4.433 percent rock steady on pre-budget levels. In the futures market, December gilts closed pit trading at 110-28 off 8/32 on the day and versus 111-07 before the speech.</p>
<p>The pound was quoted at 2.5517/28 marks compared with a fresh 32 month high of 2.5586 hit before the speech and up from 2.5403/14 late on Monday.</p>
<p>Against the dollar, the pound was trading at $1.6740/50 compared with $1.6687/97 before the speech.</p>
