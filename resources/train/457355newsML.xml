<p>Women in Hollywood have long complained about a studio system that gave all the good parts to nubile 20 year olds, then sent them off to early retirement before they reached middle age.</p>
<p>But a good number of the contenders for Oscars on Monday are what casting agents politely call &quot;women of a certain age,&quot; appearing on screen older than their years, with makeup and lighting accentuating, rather than concealing, the lines of time.</p>
<p>British actress Brenda Blethyn so thoroughly transformed herself into a dishevelled, bleary eyed factory worker for &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies,&quot; that during a recent encounter, a fan of the film looked her straight in the face without a flash of recognition.</p>
<p>Then there is Frances McDormand, another best actress nominee, for her part in &quot;Fargo.&quot; Whatever sex appeal other actresses have managed to squeeze into a police uniform eluded McDormand, who played a pregnant woman cop working the frozen plains of Minnesota in a fur hat. She waddled over the ice like a duck and spoke with an accent that screamed &quot;hick.&quot;</p>
<p>Diane Keaton, nominated for her role in &quot;Marvin's Room,&quot; has earned the distinction of looking as if she was not wearing a speck of makeup during the whole production; &quot;Breaking The Waves&quot; star Emily Watson is a Hollywood outsider previously unknown to many in the film industry.</p>
<p>While Kristin Scott Thomas in &quot;The English Patient&quot; is closer to traditional notions of &quot;star quality,&quot; at 35, she is a mature actress who toiled for years in public television productions with limited recognition.</p>
<p>&quot;This is absolutely one of the best group of nominees,&quot; said Vivian Sobchak, professor at the UCLA School of Theatre, Film and Television. &quot;Women have often been pushed off the screen when they started to sag and not invited back until they were in their 80s to play &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; or everyone's grandma type roles.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, the joke around Hollywood was that the best way for a woman to hook an Oscar was to play a hooker. Mira Sorvino, Elizabeth Shue and Sharon Stone had all been nominated for their seductive roles as prostitutes.</p>
<p>So how did unglamorous, downright gritty roles for older women come into favour?</p>
<p>One big factor this year was &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, which starred three middle-aged actresses playing middle-aged women who their husbands dumped for younger, second wives. The film's overwhelming success was a wakeup call that yes, women over 40 could be a box office draw.</p>
<p>Arthur Hiller, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, said that the second biggest movie-going audience, after the 15-to-25 age group, is the 40-to-50 crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Producers have also found that when they do films with older men or women, the young people go too,&quot; Hiller said.</p>
<p>This recognition was helped along by the growing ranks of women working behind the camera. A long list of top actresses like Michelle Pfeiffer and Geena Davis have formed their own production companies in part to insure they can still get work even after they pass that &quot;certain age.&quot;</p>
<p>But some people offer a more ironic explanation for this year's turn of events. They say Hollywood's obsession with young, attractive females may have started to backfire.</p>
<p>Profit-minded big studios have in recent years relied increasingly on a narrow formula for success: films with flimsy story lines, plenty of action, special effects, muscular men and pretty women who don't do much but stand around looking pretty.</p>
<p>Not only did such a system undervalue the talented actresses who happened to have looks as well, but it started to bore some moviegoers, opening the door to independent films with more challenging and interesting characters.</p>
<p>Nobody knows this better than Lauren Bacall, who 50 years ago was the toast of Tinseltown, only to age and be relegated to cat food commercials.</p>
<p>But that all changed this year when Bacall received her first-ever Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces.&quot; Most oddsmakers have this revived, 72-year-old legend as the easy winner.</p>
