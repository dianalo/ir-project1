<p>British government bonds are offering yields similar to Italian BTPs, but the barrage of economic and political uncertainty in the market means there is little value at current levels, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Recent British data have provided evidence of economic growth and while these have been offset by strength in sterling for now, inflationary pressures are on the horizon and will result in a reassessment of interest rates, further out.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been riding the more favourable stories we have seen over the past month or so, but are not inclined to go chasing after the market from here,&quot; said Andrew Bevan, senior international bond economist at Goldman Sachs in London.</p>
<p>He said Wednesday's employment data pointed to solid underlying growth in the economy while the January retail price index released earlier, was also disappointing for bonds.</p>
<p>The data came in unchanged on the month compared with a rise of 0.3 percent in December and rose 2.8 percent year on year versus a rise of 2.5 percent previously.</p>
<p>&quot;We also have the additional uncertainty of the electon call and not knowing when that is going to be made,&quot; Bevan said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you put it all together, and given the rally in the market that has taken place in the recent past, gilts have probably gone as far as they can for the time being.&quot;</p>
<p>The 10-year gilt is currently yielding 166 basis points over Bunds, having pulled in from 189 at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Adrian Owens, European economist at Julius Baer Investments in London, said there were signs that the economy was not going to pick up as rapidly as people had anticipated. Coupled with the recent strength in sterling, this had led to a reassessment of interest rates which was now priced into the market, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The risks are that over the next few months we will start to see further signs of a pick up in activity, and once again the talk of a potential sharp pick up in consumer demand will be on the agenda,&quot; he said. &quot;That will weigh on the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Owens saw the gilt/Bund gap drifting out to around 180 basis points over the next couple of months.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot will depend on sterling. If we continue to see further sharp gains, then clearly that will underpin the market,&quot; he said. &quot;But sterling is probably moving into the region where at least a short-term correction might be expected.&quot;</p>
<p>Bevan said it was difficult to make a case for continued independent sterling strength and this would call for a slightly more cautious approach to gilts.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not inclined to go short, but those who are lucky enough to have been long should be taking profits and going flat again, then looking for an opportunity to reassess if we see the market pull back from here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs view was for the gilt/Bund spread to be in a broad range from 160 to 200 basis points, with a near term pull back towards the 180 to 190 level, Bevan said.</p>
<p>Adam Cole, economist at HSBC James Capel in London, said near term gilts might make some further progress, in light of uncertainty surrounding peripheral European bond markets, but he then saw the spread stretching towards 200 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;We are towards the pessimistic end of expectations on UK inflation and towards the optimistic end on growth,&quot; he said. &quot;The market has really become a little bit too sanguine on the outlook for UK inflation and the outlook for short-term interest rates. As such, on anything more than a very short term view, gilts would not be one of our favoured markets within Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>On the political front, analysts said there was less concern in the market, with a Labour win at the election priced in.</p>
<p>&quot;The main political risk is a partial but incomplete Tory recovery, so that as we get closer to the election the market will start to worry about the possibility of a hung parliarment or a very weak Labour government being elected,&quot; Cole said.</p>
