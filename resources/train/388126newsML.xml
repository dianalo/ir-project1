<p>Georgia's economy contracted by 1.5 percent during the fourth quarter of 1996, according to Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University.</p>
<p>A slowdown in the state's economic growth after the Summer Olympic Games ended had been widely expected by economists. The games, which ended August 4, gave the state's economy an artifical boost.</p>
<p>Ratajczack's report, released at a news conference, indicated that negative growth occurred in the final quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>But Jeff Humphreys, chief economic forecaster for the University of Georgia, said his preliminary research shows that at worst the state's economy last quarter was flat. &quot;We may be on cruise control but not in decline,&quot; Humphreys told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Humphreys said he was sticking by his forecast in December that gross state product would grow by 3.3 percent, compared to the nation's 2.2 percent. His state forecast is higher than Ratajczak's and his national forecast is lower.</p>
<p>At the news conference, Ratajczak said the state's economy was not in serious trouble and that a rebound was already under way.</p>
<p>Gross State Product is expected to advance by 2.5 percent in 1997, and by the same amount in 1998, Ratajczak said. That's about half the amount that Georgia's Olympic-aided economy surged in 1996.</p>
<p>He forecast a 3.2 percent increase in Gross Domestic Product f this year, meaning that for the first time in four years, Georgia's economy would trail the nation's.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter decline in 1996 was blamed on lagging sales during the Christmas shopping season, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that 8.5 million people came to the Olympic Games but a lot of those people were from Georgia and they spent money on the Olympics and didn't have money (left) to spend on Christmas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cushioning the decline in consumer spending was strength in manufacturing, with the exception of apparel and electronic components, Ratajczak said.</p>
<p>State government revenues should grow by 5.5 percent during the current fiscal year ending June 30, which will be slightly more than enough to finance Georgia's budget.</p>
<p>However, the 5.6 percent increase in revenues needed to finance the fiscal 1998 budget proposed by Gov. Zell Miller that the legislature is now debating was unlikely, Ratajczak said. &quot;He's not going to get over 5 percent&quot; because of a slowing in sales tax receipts, he added.</p>
<p>The state legislature last year repealed a 4 percent state sales tax on groceries. Half of the tax was removed in October, another percentage point will be lifted this October, and the ballance is scheduled to be repealed one year later.</p>
