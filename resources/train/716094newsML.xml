<p>A new epoch of multi-party politics began in Mexico on Tuesday after early results from landmark elections gave opposition parties an unprecedented voice in the country's political future.</p>
<p>President Ernesto Zedillo of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) sought to open the dialogue with his political opponents even before final results were available from Sunday's polls that broke the 68-year PRI grip on power.</p>
<p>While voters handed victory to the PRI's political rival Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in the Mexico City mayoral race, the final makeup of the lower house of Congress was still unclear.</p>
<p>The newly independent Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) gave its last preliminary count late on Monday indicating the PRI had lost its absolute majority in Congress' lower house -- which in the past simply rubber-stamped most legislation sent by the president.</p>
<p>IFE officials were not scheduled to begin processing final results until on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Of the 300 directly elected seats in the lower house, IFE gave the PRI 161 against 71 for the PRD and 67 for the conservative National Action Party (PAN), with almost 87 percent of votes counted.</p>
<p>The remaining 200 seats will be allocated by proportional representation and newspapers on Tuesday had already begun guessing the colours of the new chamber, all of them predicting the PRI would lose its longtime majority in the 500-seat body.</p>
<p>Although the elections were seen as Mexico's cleanest to date overall, opposition parties on Tuesday began to cast doubt over some of the individual races -- especially in two hotly contested gubernatorial contests.</p>
<p>The conservative National Action Party (PAN) said it refused to accept a preliminary result in the northern state of Sonora showing PRI candidate Armando Lopez Nogales winning the governorship over the PAN's Enrique Salgado.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible to accept, that in a state where the opposition governs 84 percent of the municipalities, the PRI claims it won the gubernatorial race ... Besides, the PRI lost its majority in the state congress and lost every race for federal congress, according to the results,&quot; Salgado said.</p>
<p>And in the impoverished southern state of Campeche, some 12,000 people led by PRD state candidate Layda Sansores took to the streets of the state capital to protest alleged fraud by the PRI, chanting &quot;We're with you Layda,&quot; &quot;We want no more fraud,&quot; and &quot;Campechans unite.&quot;</p>
<p>On a national level, however, things were quiet, almost friendly between opposing political forces. Zedillo began the delicate task of courting the opposition to prevent legislative gridlock when Congress opens in September.</p>
<p>&quot;Following (Sunday's) elections all parties are entering a new era in which ... we must promote dialogue, agreement and consensus,&quot; Zedillo said in a post-electoral speech at the presidential mansion of Los Pinos.</p>
<p>In an unusual gesture, he held out the hand of friendship to main opposition parties, which he tirelessly attacked during the election campaign, and paid special tribute to an unlikely bedfellow -- the leftist PRD.</p>
<p>The PRD, a party on the brink of collapse just a few years ago, made a huge leap in the elections, its strength largely buoyed by Cardenas's landslide victory.</p>
<p>Of all Mexican parties, the PRD has been most stubborn in its opposition to Zedillo's economic reform agenda, though Cardenas and other party leaders softened some of their radical left-wing views leading up to the elections.</p>
<p>&quot;I have always thought that a party of the left, a strong one, as the PRD showed it was yesterday, is good for Mexico,&quot; Zedillo said, reiterating his offer to work with Cardenas.</p>
<p>Cardenas has been similarly conciliatory, acknowledging the president's political reforms helped level the playing field in a country long considered a one-party state.</p>
