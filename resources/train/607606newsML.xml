<title>TURKEY: Turkish troops move deep into northern Iraq.</title>
<headline>Turkish troops move deep into northern Iraq.</headline>
<dateline>DIYARBAKIR, Turkey 1997-05-22</dateline>

<p>Turkish troops have pushed 200 km (125 miles) into northern Iraq in a nine-day cross-border offensive against Kurdish guerrillas, Iraqi Kurdish officials in Turkey said on Thursday.</p>
<p>This represents a far deeper penetration of Iraqi territory than past incursions, and follows Turkish reports that Iraq, Syria and Iran have all built up forces in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkish soldiers have set up a checkpoint near the town of Aqra which is 200 kilometres by road from the Turkish border,&quot; a KDP official in Diyarbakir told Reuters.</p>
<p>Aqra is 100 km (60 miles) east of the provincial capital Dohuk.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 Turkish troops, allied with the local KDP, poured into northern Iraq last week in a major operation in pursuit of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) separatists who use northern Iraq as a base to launch raids into southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>The operation has been criticised by Turkey's Western allies and the United Nations, and unnerved its neighbours.</p>
<p>The KDP official, who asked not to be identified, said Turkish forces had also established a presence in Atrush, the site of a former U.N. refugee camp, east of Dohuk.</p>
<p>&quot;Some Turkish army units were installed in the former Atrush camp yesterday (Wednesday),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Iraqi Kurdish sources say the camp is now empty but it is of symbolic significance for Turkey which always maintained the camp was controlled by the PKK.</p>
<p>The Turkish army said on Wednesday it had killed 1,146 PKK rebels during the incursion and captured the Zap valley which it says was the main base for the PKK in the area.</p>
<p>Sources close to the PKK say these figures are exaggerated.</p>
<p>An Iraqi opposition group reported heavy fighting between Turkish troops and the PKK around Chamcha, to the north of Dohuk -- the main town in the area -- and between the KDP and the PKK in the Mateen mountains, 60 kilometres (40 miles) northeast of Dohuk.</p>
<p>The Iraqi National Congress spokesman said Turkish artillery bombarded PKK positions on the nearby Gara mountains from morning to nightfall on Wednesday, inflicting heavy casualties. He gave no figures.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Turkish security forces ferried further supplies into northern Iraq through the Habur border crossing, witnesses said.</p>
