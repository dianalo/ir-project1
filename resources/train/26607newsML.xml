<p>French President Jacques Chirac was meeting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on Sunday to discuss Paris's struggle to meet the conditions for the European Union's flagship project, a European single currency.</p>
<p>Financial markets have become increasingly worried that France, plagued by a stagnant economy and record unemployment, may be falling behind in its attempts to cut public spending.</p>
<p>Equally worryingly for the French government are signs that the autumn of discontent which last year undermined its attempts to slash the welfare budget could be repeated.</p>
<p>Marc Blondel, the head of France's Force Ouvriere union which led a crippling transport strike last year, said on Saturday growing discontent pointed to social unrest in coming weeks and attacked plans for austerity in the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the same situation as last year. All ingredients of discontent are there,&quot; Blondel said in an interview published in the daily Le Monde.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now the French viewed difficult times as unavoidable and unemployment as a trial. But gloom is progressively turning into discontent and anger,&quot; he said. Force Ouvriere has called a protest march on September 21 as a warning to the government.</p>
<p>Bonn faces a struggle of its own to get its budget deficit inside the limits required to qualify for monetary union (EMU) in 1999, but has so far been more effective than Paris in pushing through welfare cuts against massive union opposition.</p>
<p>Kohl has in the past used regular Franco-German summits to express his confidence that France will fulfil the EMU criteria on time and underline that a single currency is inconceivable without France's participation.</p>
<p>A German government spokesman said on Friday that it was likely EMU would top the agenda at Sunday's talks, taking place at Kohl's private bungalow next to the Rhine-side chancellery.</p>
<p>Kohl and Chirac may also return to the subject of defence cuts which have introduced an element of strain into bilateral relations this year.</p>
<p>Budget restrictions have forced Bonn and Paris to reevaluate defence projects on which they had planned to cooperate, exposing different priorities on both sides of the Rhine.</p>
<p>France is withdrawing many of the troops it has stationed in Germany as part of a radical overhaul to convert its conscript army into a volunteer force better equipped for long-range rapid deployment.</p>
<p>The cuts have called into question a number of joint procurement and task-sharing projects.</p>
<p>While France has appeared less committed to two projects for new transport and attack helicopters, German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe has said a cut in his own budget means he cannot finance Bonn's promised participation in France's pet project to build two military spy satellites.</p>
<p>A joint task force is producing a comprehensive review of all 27 joint defence projects which is due to be completed before the end of the year.</p>
