<headline>Analysts douse Vodafone, C&amp;W bid talk.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>London telecoms analysts on Monday dismissed speculation that British telecoms groups Vodafone and Cable and Wireless might attract a bid in the wake of British Telecommunications' $20 billion merger with MCI.</p>
<p>Vodafone and Cable and Wireless opened sharply higher on Monday amid hopes that BT's deal with MCI, the second biggest U.S. carrier, might prod U.S. telecoms giant AT&amp;T into seeking a similar deal.</p>
<p>While some analysts said Vodafone may become a future bid target, few thought Cable and Wireless would attract a takeover after merger talks with BT failed six months ago.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm amazed that people are still talking about Cable and Wireless being bid for,&quot; said one analyst who declined to be named. &quot;It has been demonstrated by BT that C&amp;W is bid proof.&quot;</p>
<p>The regulatory uncertainties, difficulties in valueing C&amp;W and its 57.5 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications -- as well as the need, under Hong Kong law, to buy out the balance of Hong Kong Telecom, combined to make a bitter pill for any potential bidder, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;AT&amp;T may be deemed big enough but they have moved horribly slowly of late,&quot; said an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.  </p>
<p>&quot;To do something all of a sudden would be out of character.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said that mobile telephone market leader Vodafone, which held most of its gains and was trading at 245, a rise of 8.5 pence by 1415 GMT, was undervalued in the face of an aceleration in the UK mobile telephone market and its new product range.</p>
<p>&quot;This deal does help to underpin Vodafone's international valuation,&quot; said one analyst who declined to be named, adding that the group may form an alliance with another international firm.</p>
<p>Vodafone is attractive because it provides local access via its mobile network without the need of spending vast quantities of money building trenches.</p>
<p>&quot;We do belive Vodafone's value is underpinned by the BT/MCI developments and there might be more development in the near term. What I don't believe we'll see, is AT&amp;T coming in to make a bid,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By 1430 GMT, Cable and Wireless' shares had lost earlier gains and were trading at 487.5 pence, a loss of two pence.</p>
