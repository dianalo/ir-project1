<headline>Albright hints seeks co-operation from Hun Sen.</headline>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made clear on Friday Washington disapproved of Cambodian strongman Hun Sen's grab for power, but sought now to work with him rather than try to isolate or drive him from power.</p>
<p>After the coup, the United States suspended all aid to Cambodia for 30 days until the beginning of August while it examined the situation in the country. U.S. officials have said they would like to reinstate aid for programmes not controlled by Phnom Penh, like landmine destruction.</p>
<p>Albright, en route to Malaysia for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations annual meeting, told reporters aboard her military aicrcraft that ASEAN faced several challenges on its 30th anniversary, including reaching outside itself to deal with issues like Cambodia.</p>
<p>Inwardly, it must deal with its expansion to include new members like Burma, whom Washington opposed, and Laos.</p>
<p>After rejecting the idea of mediation of the Cambodian crisis by ASEAN, Hun Sen indicated he might accept it. Albright called this important but, noting an ambiguous aspect to the leader's comments, she said &quot;I am not convinced of anything until I see it.&quot;</p>
<p>Albright, who took office in February, is attending her first ASEAN meeting and she seemed to make a point of striking a cooperative note with Asian nations who sometimes resent American involvement or heavy-handedness.</p>
<p>ASEAN, founded when its original member nations were engulfed in violence in 1967, have exceeded expectations of what they could accomplish and &quot;their behaviour towards each other ... is exemplary in terms of the way they operate on a consensual basis,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>While reasserting her view of America's special leadership role in the world, Albright said: &quot;I believe the best role for the United States is as a partner and as somebody who respects the operating procedures of various countries.&quot;</p>
<p>She repeated U.S. objections to the way Hun Sen, Cambodia's second prime minister, ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the first prime minister, by force on July 6.</p>
<p>But she stressed the goal of returning Cambodia to &quot;normalcy&quot; and a democratic path by preparations for new internationally-monitored elections next spring, allowing opposition parties to function and permitting Ranariddh and other members of his royalist party to return from exile.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to judge Hun Sen's behaviour as it moves forward (to see) whether he is capable now of dealing with another prime minister in a power-sharing situation and where there is no resort to force,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Cambodia's parliament is expected to vote on a replacement for Ranariddh on Monday. U.S. officials say they will watch to see if parliamentarians vote freely or are subject to intimidation.</p>
<p>Japan, the world's leading aid donor, has signalled its willingess to continue funding for Cambodia, which depends on international assistance for about half its budget. Albright acknowledged differences on this issue.</p>
<p>On Burma, whose military rulers Albright considers among the most repressive on Earth, the secretary said she hoped ASEAN would use its influence to persuade the junta to open a dialogue with Nobel Prize winning activist Aung San Suu Kyi and her pro-democracy party.</p>
<p>At ASEAN, U.S. officials are also keen to discuss trade relations, U.S.-Japan security ties, anti-drug efforts, Korean peninsula peace efforts and the worrisome recent currency fluctuations among tiger economies like Thailand and Indonesia, which have had an impact on the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no reason to believe this will lead to a Mexican style crisis. We have confidence in the ability of these ASEAN countries to withstand exchange market turbulence so long as they pursue sound and prudent policies,&quot; said a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
