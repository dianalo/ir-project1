<p>Germany's IG Metall trade union said on Wednesday it was now optimistic of securing acceptable wage deals in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, two of the largest metal and engineering regions in Germany.</p>
<p>But the country's most powerful union warned employers that if they refused to offer at least what was included in a break-through package signed in the state of Lower Saxony last week, they would face further protests and possible strikes.</p>
<p>&quot;If employers take a position below that offered by employers in the Lower Saxony, the path to possible industrial action would be a fast one to go down,&quot; an IG Metall official in the southern state of Bavaria said.</p>
<p>Bavarian labour leaders in October already announced they would be terminating wage contracts for the some 650,000 workers there in a move that would make all-out strikes legally possible by early March.</p>
<p>Any deals in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia, which between them employ nearly half of the three million-plus workers in the metal and engineering industries, would make the all-out strikes orginally threatened for next year unlikely.</p>
<p>IG Metall hailed last Thursday's agreement, which itself only applies to the some 90,000 workers in the northern region of Lower Saxony, as a break-through after protests involving hundreds of thousands of workers and costing industry millions of marks.</p>
<p>Under the Lower Saxony package, workers will receive a 1.5 percent rise in 1997 salaries and a 2.5 percent increase in 1998. In return for maintaining full sick pay, workers have agreed to lower Christmas bonuses.</p>
<p>Crucially, the accord maintains sick pay entitlements at 100 percent of salary rather than the cut to 80 percent that employers had orginally sought, and which triggered the nationwide protests.</p>
<p>Employer groups have meanwhile pointed out that the headline wage rise is barely in line with inflation -- and is well short not only of past wage agreements in the sector but also IG metall's original 4.5-5.0 percent wage claim.</p>
<p>In North Rhine Westphalia, where talks are continuing for the some 850,000 metal workers employed largely in its huge steel manufacturing plants, both IG Metall and regional employer groups were also hopeful of an imminent deal.</p>
<p>IG Metall said it expected a deal to be signed as early as Wednesday, again based largely on the Lower Saxony model.</p>
<p>But employer negotiators there said unspecified &quot;regional characteristics&quot; of the North-Rhine Westphalian industry must be taken into account into any wage pact.</p>
<p>In the smaller central state of Hesse, employers said late on Tuesday that they could accept an agreement similar to that signed in Lower Saxony.</p>
<p>Firms in the northern part of Baden-Wuerttemberg in the south said earlier this week they were determined to thrash out their own wage agreement for the 300,000 workers there rather than adopt the accord reached in Lower Saxony.</p>
