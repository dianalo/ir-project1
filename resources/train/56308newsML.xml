<p>Wall Street stocks were expected to open slightly lower on Monday, hurt by weakness in oil stocks and profit-taking after Friday's record close.</p>
<p>But market sentiment was expected to remain strong, with many investors now discounting the possibility of a sharp hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve this month.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Dow industrials jumped 67 to an unofficial record of 5,839, its first close above 5800. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composte also posted strong gains.</p>
<p>&quot;We might be headed for a slightly lower opening and then some stabilization ... and an attempt to move higher,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect we'll see profit-taking. Also, Iraq is putting pressure on the oil market which could weaken oil stocks,&quot; he said.</p>
