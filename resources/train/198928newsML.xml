<p>Citicorp's announcement of an expanded share repurchase program was not a big surprise, analysts said.</p>
<p>The company said it's board of directors on Tuesday authorized the continuation of the existing program to purchase common stock with an additional $4 billion through December 31, 1998, raising to $8.5 billion the total authorized for share buybacks since June 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;My expectations assume that they will continuously be updating these authorizations,&quot; said Arthur Soter, analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.  </p>
<p>Citicorp has been telling Wall Street for the last few years that it generates about $2 billion a year in &quot;free capital&quot;, which it does not need in its business and this excess capital can be used to repurchase shares.</p>
<p>Asked at the time of the third quarter earnings release in October if buying back shares was a good idea in view of the fact the stock had risen to the mid-90s, executive vice president and principal financial officer Thomas Jones said share buybacks made sense if the market valuation on the company's shares is at a discount relative to other stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.  </p>
<p>Soter said Citicorp has a policy to eliminate excess capital and return it to shareholders and, &quot;the fact of the matter is that with the stock going up, they constantly have to revise these programs.&quot;</p>
<p>Citicorp said that, as of September 30, the company had purchased 51.1 million shares under the program for a total outlay of $3.8 billion.</p>
<p>During the third quarter ending September, the company had an average of 485.6 million shares outstanding fully diluted.</p>
<p>Citicorp was up 1-5/8 to 106-7/8 late on Tuesday.</p>
