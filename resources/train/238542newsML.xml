<p>-- PARIS SUSPENDS THOMSON SALE</p>
<p>The French government has unexpectedly suspended the privatisation of electronics giant Thomson amid widespread public unrest over plans by the prospective buyer, Lagardere, to sell Thomson's consumer electronics arm to the South Korean firm Daewoo.

Under Lagardere's plans, Daewoo was to acquire the money-draining division for a nominal 1 French franc.</p>

<p>-- NATWEST TO CUT 10,000 JOBS IN RETAIL DIVISION</p>

<p>-- REVELLERS MAY HAVE TO SHELL OUT MORE FOR NUTS</p>
<p>Poor weather in California and Iran is set to increase the price of nuts in the UK just in time for Christmas. Pistachio nuts have already risen in price by 20 percent after half this year's Iranian crop was affected by bad weather, while a poor Californian crop for the second year running has forced up the price of almonds by 20 percent in the last six weeks. Price intervention by the Turkish government has seen the cost of hazelnuts surge by 35 percent since August.</p>

But the High Court decision now means that full responsibility for the winding up of Scandex will rest with Denmark.</p>
