<p>Iranian state radio accused the United States on Tuesday of provoking inter-Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq to counter Iran's influence in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of America's concern over Iran's role among Iraqi Kurdish groups...any move to provoke Kurdish groups to start fighting is attributed to the White House,&quot; state-run Tehran radio said in a commentary.</p>
<p>Guerrillas of Kurdish warlord Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) have been fighting rebels of Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).</p>
<p>The radio said the United States was trying to provoke the fighting to thwart a ceasefire reached by the two groups after Iranian-sponsored talks in Tehran in October.</p>
<p>&quot;America is trying to cause new clashes in northern Iraq to pave the way for its presence in this region under the guise of mediation,&quot; the radio added.</p>
<p>Washington brokered a ceasefire on Friday and persuaded the two factions to attend peace talks next month in London, hosted by Britain. But fighting reportedly flared over the weekend.</p>
<p>The United States said on Monday it saw no useful role for Iran in northern Iraq after Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said only Tehran could bring peace to the area.</p>
<p>The State Department called on both sides to fulfil their commitments to implement an immediate ceasefire and return their forces to positions held before August 17.</p>
<p>&quot;In our view, continued fighting between the Kurds would only set back their interests,&quot; Glyn Davies, the department's acting chief spokesman said. He said such fighting also cleared the way for outside forces to pursue their own agendas.</p>
<p>Iranian radio said U.S. mediation would fail because Kurdish groups did not trust Washington and regional states opposed interference by outside powers.</p>
<p>Iraq has accused both Washington and Tehran of meddling in the affairs of its Kurdish minority.</p>
<p>The KDP has accused Iran of backing the PUK while the PUK has accused Baghdad's forces of shelling its positions.</p>
<p>More than 100 people have been killed in the fighting and hundreds of families have been made homeless, a United Nations official in the region said on Monday.</p>
