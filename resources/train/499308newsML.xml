<text>
<p>Bulgaria's chief prosecutor's office said on Thursday it had ordered the arrest of three former directors of bankrupt Mineralbank and set bail for the other three on suspicion of misappropriation of funds.</p>
<p>State-owned Mineralbank was declared insolvent on March 31 and its executive directors Vladimir Tashkov, Kiril Nikolov and Roumen Kasabov were arrested on Tuesday, the chief prosecutor said in a statement.</p>
<p>The six board members of Mineralbank abused their position and illegally extended credits to firms and individuals between January 1, 1992 and May 17, 1996, the statement said.</p>
<p>Mineralbank's board illegally extended $34.5 million and 808.4 million levs to 15 companies, including oil trader Euroenergy Holding and related firms, oil refinery Plama, Harsev and Co, Cypriot retailer Stambouli and Liechtenstein-registered Turkmen Establishment, it said.</p>
<p>A four million lev ($2,550) bail has been set for Mineralbank's former board members Emil Harsev, Asen Zaprianov and a two million lev bail was set for Jivko Stoimenov, said the statement.</p>
<p>Harsev, was deputy central bank governor until 1993 and now owns the Harsev and Co. financial consultancy firm.</p>
<p>Under the charges the bankers face between three and 10 years in jail.</p>
<p>&quot;A preliminary investigation was initiated after evidence for a committed crime had been collected,&quot; said the statement.</p>
<p>The BNB placed Mineralbank in receivership on May 17, 1996 dismissed its management and appointed sequestrators.</p>
<p>Last June Mineralbank failed to honour maturity payments on seven-year samurai bonds worth a total of five billion yen issued in 1989 with the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ) being the lead arranger for the issue.</p>
<p>Mineralbank's total debts to foreign banks amount to $240 million, including $150 million of bonds and loans owed to the banks grouped in the IBJ.</p>
<p>Before the insolvency announcement Banque National de Paris had shown interest in buying a stake in Mineralbank, where the government holds 80 percent, resident bankers said.</p>
<p>Mineralbank is the first large state-owned local bank ruled insolvent out of 16 banks for which the BNB has sought insolvency.</p>
<p>Mineralbank, set up as an investment bank by Bulgaria's former communist regime in the 1980s, had racked up losses of 8.6 billion levs by the end of 1995, its annual report showed.</p>
