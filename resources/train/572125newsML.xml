<p>Wall Street stocks edged up to marginal gains in early afternoon on Friday, but investors appeared unwilling to bid stocks beyond narrow ranges.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials were up 19 points at 7155 and the S&amp;P 500 rose three points to 823.</p>
<p>Techs and small caps also kept to tight bands, with the Nasdaq Composite up two points to 1333 and the Russell 2000 up fractionally at 361.</p>
<p>Afternoon trading lacked any semblance of the choppiness that marked the morning, when blue chips bounced higher only to turn lower and then just as quickly recoup losses.  </p>
<p>&quot;It looked like there was some early selling to take profits and then the buying population just disappeared,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities.  &quot;There just aren't enough buyers here to keep the market heading up.&quot;</p>
<p>Breadth was modestly positive, with advancers running ahead of decliners by about four-to-three on the NYSE. Bonds held to moderate gains, with the 30-year U.S. Treasury up 11/32 to yield 6.91 percent.</p>
