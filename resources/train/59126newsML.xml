<p>Britain's leading Roman Catholic cardinal complained on Tuesday that his country was obsessed by sex and said the church could relax its centuries-old insistence on the celibacy of priests.</p>
<p>Cardinal Basil Hume, reacting to the resignation of a Scottish bishop linked with a divorcee, said the Catholic church was losing many excellent candidates for the priesthood because they wanted to be free to marry.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not divine law. It is Church law, so any Pope or General Council could change it,&quot; he told BBC Radio.</p>
<p>Hume, head of the church in England and Wales, said society had become obsessed with the pleasures of the flesh. &quot;We are peddling unreal fantasies about what it is to be human. I think people are being given false promises.</p>
<p>&quot;Our society is very preoccupied with sex. It is not a bad thing to have people who can witness to love without sex.&quot;</p>
<p>Pope John Paul is implacably imposed to any change in church law. The Vatican insists on celibacy from its priests and nuns, saying the church's consecrated members must be celibate in order to devote themselves completely to God and their work.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church was attracting an increasing number of new priests worldwide but Hume admitted: &quot;We are also losing excellent and very good people because they would wish to be married priests. There is no question of that.&quot;</p>
<p>Hume hinted that married priests had a role to play. &quot;Obviously a man who has been married, a married priest, brings a very special experience to their ministry, such as in the Anglican Communion and the Orthodox churches.&quot;</p>
<p>Hume's stance was in sharp contrast to the unbending line taken by the Archbishop of Glasgow, Cardinal Thomas Winning, after the resignation of the Bishop of Argyll, Roderick Wright.</p>
<p>He said Wright, who disappeared from his home last weekend at the same time as divorcee Kathleen Macphee, had been guilty of a major lapse.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe it would be foolish of the church to change any rules of celibacy in a world where permanency is almost rejected - permanency in careers, in relationships,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the runaway bishop can stay a priest if he gives up any sexual relationship he might have been having. Winning believed this was Wright's preferred option.</p>
<p>If a bishop has admitted an affair or it is proven, the Vatican would probably &quot;urgently request&quot; the bishop to resign under church canon (law) 401 when he has become unable to fulfill his office due to health or &quot;another serious reason.&quot;</p>
<p>Wright had maintained a low profile as a bishop but did speak out about celibacy in the priesthood in 1992 after the Bishop of Galway, Eamonn Casey, admitted being the father of a teenage boy in a case that caused a huge scandal in Ireland.</p>
<p>Wright said there should be more flexibility on the subject of celibacy and added that he did not see any conflict in a married man being ordained.</p>
