<p>The search for value in the well-performed oil and gas sector has helped push the share price of Santos Ltd sharply higher in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Adelaide-based explorer and producer has seen its shares jump from around A$5.50 at the end of last month to A$6.45 on Friday, after touching a 12-month high of A$6.55 earlier.</p>
<p>Analysts said several recent discoveries had brought more attention to the stock which has tended to be overshadowed by juniors seen as having a more exciting exploration potential.  </p>
<p>Several brokers have rerated the stock in recent weeks, including BT Securities, which upgraded its valuation by 15 percent on Thursday and set a 12-month target price of A$7.00.</p>
<p>BT analyst Stuart Baker said the upgrade was based on recent exploration success, new gas contracts, the lower Australian dollar and lower long-term bond rates.</p>
<p>Santos remained one of the cheapest of the larger stocks, and the market was only beginning to build in an exploration premium which has long applied to companies such as Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Oil Search, he said.  </p>
<p>Santos has significantly increased its exploration activity this year, spending A$173 million in 1997 to drill at least 109 wells.</p>
<p>&quot;They have really got on and built their acreage,&quot; said Baker. &quot;Santos is in every major producing basin in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Recent exploration successes have come in the onshore Cooper-Eromanga basin in Queensland and South Australia.</p>
<p>But the company is also represented in the Carnarvon Basin and Timor Gap offshore Western Australia, and has intersts in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and further afield.  </p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has also recently upgraded Santos. putting a value on the stock of A$6.50 to A$7.00.</p>
<p>Analyst Russell Langusch said the recommendation was based on a belief that the oil price could ease slightly, rather than a valuation argument.</p>
<p>&quot;Santos represents a good conservative position in a market that has been overvalued,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company offered growth of more than 10 percent on earnings yield and dividend yield, but had lagged more speculative stocks in recent weeks.</p>
