<p>Russian Urals crude sold sharply lower in the Mediterranean at a $1.30 discount to international benchmark Dated Brent blend on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>The price agreed for the 80,000 tonne March 28/29 loader heading to an eastern Mediterranean destination was around 25 cents lower than the previously reported level, they said.</p>
<p>In another sign of market weakness, an 80,000 tonne Urals loading March 22/24 and also heading to the east Mediterranean changed hands at dated -$1.15 CIF, traders said. A third Urals also traded at dated -$1.15 CIF but the destination was not immediately known.</p>
<p>In nothern Europe, a cargo of Urals due to load March 18/20 was sold at Dated -90 cents CIF.</p>
<p>The trades confirmed talk earlier that the market value of the grade was substantially lower than previously reported deals.</p>
<p>Much of the activity has been conducted on a private and confidential basis by sellers anxious to shore up maximum value in a crumbling market.</p>
<p>Despite Wednesday's sales traders said they saw at least five million barrels of Urals unsold for March. Two Urals were done late last week and early this week at Dated -$1.05 and -$1.03.</p>
