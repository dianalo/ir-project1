<p>The Polish zloty finished an active Wednesday session unchanged against the basket of currencies as late foreign currency sell orders neutralised an early zloty slip against the basket, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said foreigners used the zloty's morning dip, caused by banks extending positions after reducing them on Wednesday, to buy zloty debt instruments at a discount.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some late currency selling done by foreigners entering zloty instruments,&quot; said Tomasz Nowakowski, forex dealer at Bank Handlowy SA.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed flat at 3.02/2.98 percent from the trading band centre, flat from Wednesday's 3.01/2.98 percent. It was at 3.0690/00 to the dollar, down from 3.0673/85 on Wednesday and at 1.8365/73 to the mark, down from 1.8350/55.</p>
<p>One-day depos, which slightly eased during the day, were seen inching up on Friday as the central bank sold 400 million zlotys of 182-day and 400 million of 273-day NBP-bills.</p>
<p>Overnight deposit rates were at 22.30/22.60 percent, down from 22.45/22.65 percent at opening, tomorrow/next rates were at 22.35/22.70 percent, down from opening's 22.45/22.70.  </p>
<p>The NBP kept the average yield of its 182-day and 273-day NBP-bills flat at 22.00 pct on Thursday reinforcing market expectations of a possible interest rate cut later this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We may expect interest rate may go down in the longer run, as the NBP did not increase longer NBP-bills yields together with its 91-day paper,&quot; said Anna Biernat from BRE SA.</p>
<p>The central bank increased the average yield of its 91-day NBP-bills by 0.15 to 22.15 percent on March 25 after raising the maximum reverse repo rate to 22.15 from 21.65 percent.  </p>
<p>Players said the upward pressure on T-bill yields may cool as a result of the central bank's move to cap longer term NBP-bill yields.</p>
