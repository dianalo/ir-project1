<title>SWEDEN: SSAB sees Q2 price rise.</title>

<p>Swedish steel group SSAB said on Thursday that it expected it could raise prices in local currencies in the second quarter of this year and that the demand for steel has stabilised in the European Union (EU).  </p>
<p>SSAB said its first quarter profit after financial items fell 44 percent to 470 million crowns ($61.4 million), right on target according to a Reuter poll of analysts ahead of the report.</p>
<p>Sales fell to 4.33 billion crowns from 4.70 billion in the first quarter of 1996 and earnings per share dipped to 2.60 crowns from 4.70.</p>
<p>Relief that earnings were in line with expectations along with the company's brighter second quarter outlook sent SSAB shares higher on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>At 1015 GMT, SSAB was up seven crowns at 139, while the exchange's general index rose 0.36 percent to 2,618.15.</p>
<p>The profit was hurt by steel prices being 10 percent lower, in Swedish crowns, during the first quarter compared to the corresponding quarter 1996 but prices were one percent higher than in the fourth quarter last year, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;After five quarters with falling prices we can note a small price rise of more than one percent in the first quarter,&quot; chief executive Leif Gustafsson said in a results statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This price rise indicates a change in trends. We will be able to raise prices in local currencies somewhat further on most markets in the second quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1996, steel consumption within the European Union fell by eight percent, putting pressure on steel prices. But the situation stabilised in the first quarter, although prices were still three percent lower than average 1996 prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Steel demand has now stabilised and during the first quarter there were some price hikes and some price falls on the group's steel products,&quot; SSAB said in a statement.</p>
<p>But it still did not see any tangible signs of increased consumption.</p>
<p>&quot;The continued price development will be the decisive factor for the group's earnings development during the rest of the year,&quot; SSAB said.</p>
<p>The company also noted that it had managed to keep processing costs unchanged despite a large Swedish wage inflation. Total costs amounted to 3.71 billion crowns, compared to 3.79 billion in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>SSAB added that its 3.5 billion crown investment programme within steel operations and the unit SSAB Hard Tech was developing as planned.</p>
