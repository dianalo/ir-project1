<p>About 500 Filipina maidservants, swaying in time to Christian rock music, prayed in a downtown park for Hong Kong's peaceful handover to Chinese rule on Monday night.</p>
<p>&quot;We are praying that the handover will be peaceful. We want to share the goodness of the world with Hong Kong,&quot; said Sister Angelia Cabrera, a member of the Prayer Partners Foundation Inc.</p>
<p>Cabrera, a domestic helper who works six days a week, said she was optimistic that the handover to Chinese rule would go smoothly, and that peace would reign after China takes charge.</p>
<p>&quot;We have faith in God,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, will hand over the colony of 6.4 million people to China's President Jiang Zemin during the midnight ceremony.</p>
<p>With Christian rock blaring and Filipinas singing, Catholic priests blessed the crowd and prayed for a peaceful transition. Many of the women swayed in rhythm, waving white handkerchiefs and T-shirts above their heads.</p>
<p>The mass was organised as part of &quot;Asian Extravaganza,&quot; a two-day mixture of religion, music, national costumes, beauty pageants and sport competitions.</p>
<p>But on Monday, poor weather kept the crowds away. Cloudy skies, soggy rainshowers and humid temperatures left Kowloon Park in the ritzy shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui virtually deserted apart from the rousing Filipina mass.</p>
<p>There are 140,000 Filipinas in Hong Kong, the largest expatriate community. Most work as domestic helpers, sending about half of their salary of about US$500 per month back home to support husbands and children.</p>
<p>Their remittances make up a sizable proportion of gross domestic product in the Philippines, where unemployment is high.</p>
<p>Many Filipinas in Hong Kong are concerned about their fate after China takes control, fearing that the territory's families will soon prefer Chinese-speaking help from across the border.</p>
<p>Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa have offered assurances that the Filipinas have little to fear, but some are unconvinced.</p>
<p>&quot;They have said the status quo will be maintained, but realistically there are going to be changes,&quot; Dennis Suico, chairman of the Philippine Association of Hong Kong, said recently.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a steady inflow of workers from the mainland. It may not be drastic, it may not happen overnight, but there is going to be change.&quot;</p>
<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos said on Sunday he was confident the welfare of the maids &quot;will remain protected.&quot;</p>
