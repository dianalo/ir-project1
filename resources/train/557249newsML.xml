<p>Tony Blair's new-look Labour party stormed back to power in Britain for the first time since 1979 with a landslide victory on a scale unseen for 165 years.</p>
<p>Experts used words like &quot;terrifying&quot; to describe the extent of the defeat, which brings down the curtain on 18 years of Conservative rule that have transformed the country.</p>
<p>With 173 results counted in Thursday's election, the BBC projected Labour would have a majority of 167 in the 659-seat parliament, bettering its 144-seat majority in 1945. If confirmed, it would be the biggest margin of victory since 1832.</p>
<p>An emotional Blair, who at 43 will be Britain's youngest prime minister this century, choked back tears in an acceptance speech after he held the safe seat of Sedgefield in north-east England.</p>
<p>&quot;You have put your trust in me and I intend to repay that trust. I will not let you down,&quot; Blair said. &quot;We are a great country, the British people are a great people. There is no greater honour than to serve them, and serve them we will.&quot;</p>
<p>Blair's wife Cherie clutched her husband's hand as the result was read out. As the Labour leader stepped down from the stage he swept his young daughter into his arms before embracing his two sons.</p>
<p>All over Britain, Conservative seats tumbled like nine-pins, primarily to Labour but also to the Liberal Democrats, who looked poised to make the great breakthrough promised by party leader Paddy Ashdown.</p>
<p>Prominent casualties included Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and flamboyant ex-minister David Mellor, who said: &quot;A tidal wave has burst over the Conservative party tonight&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the first seats to fall to Labour was the weathervane seat of Basildon in the eastern suburbs of London, which doomed Labour's chances of forming a government when it was unexpectedly held by the Conservatives in the 1992 election.</p>
<p>Labour took Basildon with a massive swing of 15 percent.</p>
<p>There were early signs that defeat would lead to a bloodbath in the Conservative Party, which prides itself in being one of the most effective political machines in the world.</p>
<p>Nicholas Winterton, a Euro-sceptic Conservative fiercely opposed to closer ties with Brussels, put the blame firmly at the door of finance minister Kenneth Clarke for refusing to rule out the possibility that Britain might sign up one day for the European Union's planned single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;He will be remembered, even reviled in history for his actions,&quot; Winterton said.</p>
<p>But Clarke, the party's leading pro-European, made it clear he would not take the blame in the coming post-mortem.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been far too little about the economy in this election and far too much about Europe... Had we had more on the economy, less on Europe and a lot less on sleaze, we would have done a lot better,&quot; Clarke said. &quot;I do think the party needs to compose itself, lose with dignity.&quot;</p>
<p>At Conservative headquarters in London, the mood was as despondent as it was joyous at Labour's celebration party at the Royal Festival hall on the banks of the River Thames.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the mood of the country was for a change after 18 years in power,&quot; Sir David Steel, former leader of the centre-left Liberal Democrats whose party was set to make huge inroads of its own.</p>
<p>The BBC projected the Lib Dems, which promised to raise taxes to improve Britain's schools, could win up to 60 seats -- triple the 20 it won at the 1992 election.</p>
<p>Over 18 years, first under &quot;Iron Lady&quot; Margaret Thatcher and then under Major, the Conservatives transformed Britain, halting decades of relative economic decline by privatising vast swathes of industry and taming powerful trade unions.</p>
<p>Major's appeal to voters was &quot;better the devil you know than the devil you don't&quot;, but deep divisions over Europe, broken promises over tax and allegations of sleaze in the ruling party meant he had a Herculean task.</p>
<p>The landslide was a ringing endorsement for Blair's crusade, since he became Labour leader in 1993, to dump the left-wing policies that led it to four successive election defeats.</p>
<p>Blair has promised change -- but not too much change -- with a number of limited but specific commitments that some commentators have dubbed Conservatism with a human face.</p>
<p>Playwright Colin Welland said at Labour's victory party: &quot;It is the stuff that dreams are made of. After 18 years of seeing this country sink into selfishness and greed, where only profit mattered, I hope we will have a society again with a social awareness and social conscience and work together to make a better country for our children to grow up in.&quot;</p>
