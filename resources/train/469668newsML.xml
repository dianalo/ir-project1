<headline>Clinton &quot;concerned&quot; about Mideast peace process.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-26</dateline>

<p>President Bill Clinton said on Wednesday he sent U.S. negotiator Dennis Ross to the Middle East because he was &quot;concerned&quot; about the peace process.</p>
<p>Asked why he had sent Ross to meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton told reporters: &quot;Because I am concerned about the peace process.&quot; He said the United States was searching for ways to stop violence in the region and to restart negotiations.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have been talking among ourselves here intensely over the last several days about whether there are some ideas we ought to advance with the Israelis and the Palestinians, and particularly what we can do to minimise the violence and to get the negotiations back going,&quot; Clinton added.</p>
<p>He was speaking before a White House meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. Asked if he would consider a summit to gather the mideast leaders, Clinton said he did not want to comment before being briefed by Ross, who is expected to return to Washington by the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned about it. I think everybody in the world who has worked for peace in the middle east is concerned about it. We're all going to put our heads together and do the best we can,&quot; Clinton added.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said Ross was to leave the United States on Wednesday for Rabat, Morocco, where he is scheduled to meet Arafat on Thursday morning before flying to Israel to see Netanyahu later in the day.</p>
