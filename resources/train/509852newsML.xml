<p>Officials from Texas Instruments Inc said Tuesday they were talking to automakers about including the company's infrared night vision systems in luxury automobiles, possibly as soon as the 2000 model year.</p>
<p>&quot;We're talking to several automakers,&quot; said Doug Van Dover, a regional sales manager, who was exhibiting the company's NightSight family of thermal imaging systems at a disaster mitigation trade show in Miami. A company spokesman said he could not disclose the names of any of the auto firms the Dallas-based firm was talking to.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments previewed at the trade show its Palm IR 250, a new handheld infrared thermal imaging system it will release this summer.</p>
<p>The company said it has sold about 700 of its NightSight 100 and 200 camera systems, introduced 24 and 18 months ago.</p>
<p>Those systems, which are installed on motor vehicles and boats, allow users to see even in pitch darkness, by using differences in temperature to create visual images.</p>
<p>The technology, long used by the military, was used for security and cleanup after the crash of TWA Flight 800 last summer, at the Atlanta Olympics and, since its commercial introduction, by many law enforcement agencies.</p>
