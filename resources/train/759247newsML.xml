<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures posted new gains on Monday afternoon on the strength of New York arabica prices but conditions were subdued.</p>
<p>&quot;New York was firm and this dragged London up. Volume was small and there's no real excitement,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Turnover on the exchange stood at 2,271 lots at the close against 523 at midsession.</p>
<p>Traders also attributed to the dull trading to the summer lull and lack of fresh market features.</p>
<p>Benchmark September broke through the $1,600 per tonne mark to touch a session high at $1,619. It eventually finished $25 up at $1,615.</p>
<p>This is still within the upper end of a broad trading band of $1,477 and $1,650. Traders said there were clear signs yet where the market would head next.</p>
<p>Elli Gifford, an independent technical analyst, said robustas were more likely to come down than to go up, with the market re-testing support at just below $1,500.</p>
<p>After London closed, the New York market broke its immediate stiff barrier at 184.50 cents a lb to trade at 187.00 by 1640 GMT, up a steep 10.70 on the day.</p>
<p>A break of the upside could probably lift the market by some 10 cents and well into the mid-190s, traders said.</p>
<p>July 31 is the last trading day and delivery day for spot July contract in London.</p>
<p>Total original tenders to date is 2,300 lots or 11,500 tonnes, the bulk of which stopped by two major trade houses. Re-tenders totalled 1,038 lots.</p>
<p>On the physical front, Indonesian coffee prices continued firm on the back of tight local supply. Grade four coffee was quoted at $1,550 a tonne FOB Lampung.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, warm, high pressure over Brazil's coffee belt is expected to remain in place for the next seven days, preventing any cold air from moving into the area, Weather Services Corp said in an update on Monday.</p>
