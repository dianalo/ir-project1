<p>The answer to the age-old question -- &quot;What's for dinner?&quot; -- is going to get a lot more complicated.</p>
<p>Mid-life Baby Boomers will be demanding more variety in their diets in the future, from exotic Asian and African cuisines to down-home staples like mashed potatoes and meatloaf.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a fascinating yin-and-yang of it. We want to revisit our childhoods through macaroni-and-cheese and we want to visit Asia through ... (its) foods,&quot; said Faith Popcorn, chairman of New York-based BrainReserve Inc., which predicts consumer trends.</p>
<p>Ethnic foods will continue to be hot -- literally and figuratively -- with growing popularity of spicy fare from far-flung parts of the globe. Beyond the popular staples of Indian, Italian and Mexican cuisine, consumers will be trying a wider variety of foreign foods.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of us already know what Ethiopian food is. Many of us know what Szechuan Chinese food is,&quot; said Mark McLellan, chairman of Cornell's Department of Food Science and Techology.</p>
<p>McLellan, director of Cornell University's Institute of Food Science, said many of the foodservice entrepreneurs he encounters are looking to bring ethnic foods to a wider consumer audience.</p>
<p>Beyond that, food scientists and trend-watchers said consumers will be turning more to food for better health, eating foods that contain certain potentially beneficial substances to prevent disease.</p>
<p>Conversely, they will be treating themselves to an indulgence like a prime-cut of beef at a top-line steakhouse.</p>
<p>Consumers will also become increasingly conscious of food-safety issues and will look to labels to tell them how and where the food was raised.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole field of nutrition and dietetics is in the most interesting time since I've been in the field, and one of the most challenging times,&quot; said Jenny Taylor Bond, professor of nutrition in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at Michigan State University and a 23-year veteran.</p>
<p>One trend Bond expects to grow is the use of food as medicine, with an emphasis on herbs to promote health and prevent diseases such as arthritis.</p>
<p>But don't expect consumers to be good all the time.</p>
<p>&quot;People are fed up with being told what they can't do. They're saying, 'I want my steak. I want my cigar and I want my martini,'&quot; said Maureen Reynolds, director of marketing for the California Beef Council.</p>
<p>This trend toward the occasional indulgence, Reynolds said, is likely to continue, particularly as Baby Boomers and Generation X'ers enjoy healthy disposable incomes.</p>
<p>Whatever is on the plate -- from pot roast just like mom's to marinated eggplant and grilled shrimp -- little of it will be prepared in the kitchen, even though more of it may be consumed at home.</p>
<p>&quot;People aren't cooking at home,&quot; said David Magill, principal of Magill and Associates, a San Francisco-based restaurant and food consulting company.</p>
<p>&quot;They want all these flavors. They want mom food. (At restaurants) there it is before their very eyes.&quot;</p>
