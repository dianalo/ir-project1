<p>Despite a 10-year illness that has left him almost unable to speak, boxing legend Muhammad Ali still retains the good-humoured arrogance that has made him one of the most publicised figures in modern sporting history.</p>
<p>In his heyday of the 1960s and 1970s it was Ali's claim to be &quot;the greatest&quot; boxer ever that won him blanket media coverage and sobriquets like &quot;The Black Superman&quot;.</p>
<p>Today he tours the world promoting his Muhammad Ali Foundation in a bid to fight world hunger -- and still draws a crowd.</p>
<p>Arriving in Indonesia this month to donate 100,000 meals to a Jakarta hospital, the 54-year old Ali showed glimpses of his former expertise, exhibiting his trademark shuffle in a mock punch-up with airport security guards.</p>
<p>Every Indonesian newspaper carried pictures of the former champion on the front page the following day.</p>
<p>But his bravado masks a decade of suffering from Parkinson's Syndrome, an illness of the central nervous system. He is unable to walk properly and speaks very slowly, preferring to stay quiet in public.</p>
<p>But Ali obviously continues to enjoy the self-publicity that he first showed a flair for after beating Charles &quot;Sonny&quot; Liston to take his first world heavyweight title in 1964.</p>
<p>Immediately after the fight, the 22-year-old outsider known as Cassius Clay told the world that he had joined the &quot;Nation of Islam&quot; and was to be known from then on as Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>Although his ability to &quot;float like a butterfly and sting like a bee&quot; led Ali to lift the world boxing title on three separate occasions, it was his genius at creating a larger than life image outside the ring that gave him a truly international profile.</p>
<p>&quot;Today there are no Joe Fraziers, no George Foremans...No Muhammad Alis,&quot; the three-times champion told a news conference in Jakarta in a barely audible whisper.</p>
<p>In Indonesia to promote his fight against hunger, Ali could not resist a dig at today's boxing greats. When asked how he would deal with current heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, the ex-champion did not speak but pummelled his left palm with his right fist.</p>
<p>The audience was left in no doubt of his answer.</p>
<p>These days Ali's energies are channelled towards a very different pursuit. Working with Vitapro Foods Inc of Canada, which produces a dehydrated food product of high nutritional value, the former boxer says he wants to help the hungry all over the world.</p>
<p>Vitapro chairman Yank Barry, acting as Ali's spokesman, said that together with the Muhammad Ali Foundation they hope to feed 100 million people within two years.</p>
<p>&quot;Now he has a new fight. He's fighting world hunger,&quot; Barry said of Ali.</p>
<p>Barry himself is no slouch at the celebrity game. He sang the one-time hit single &quot;Louie Louie&quot; with The Kingsmen before abandoning music for business.</p>
<p>He said that both he and Ali wanted &quot;to pay something back to society&quot; after years of international stardom.</p>
<p>The Muhammad Ali Foundation and Vitapro teamed up in July this year with the international relief organisation CARE to ship food to a half-million refugees caught up in a civil war in the West African state of Liberia.</p>
<p>Ali's foundation has also been involved recently in aid projects in Japan, Saudi Arabia and his native United States, Barry said.</p>
<p>Ali says that his desire to help starving people is part and parcel of his strong religious faith.</p>
<p>In 1967, he refused to serve in the Vietnam War because of his adoption of Islam, which led to the stripping of his world title.</p>
<p>He won it back in 1970 after a court battle to establish the justice of his refusal.</p>
<p>Ali won the world crown for a second time fighting George Foreman in Zaire in 1974. He became the only man to win the heavyweight title thrice after he beat Olympic gold medalist Leon Spinks in 1978.</p>
<p>He finally retired from boxing in 1981.</p>
<p>Barry said that Ali, now married to his fourth wife Lonnie, is coping well with his illness.</p>
<p>&quot;On good days, he is great. In Atlanta he was tired,&quot; Barry said, referring to Ali's emotion-racked appearance at the inauguaration of the Atlanta Olympic Games earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;When Ali does talk, it is quality words,&quot; he added.</p>
