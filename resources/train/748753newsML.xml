<p>Zimbabwe unveils a budget on Thursday which will determine when key Western donors will resume crucial financial aid suspended two years ago over missed economic targets.</p>
<p>Officials from the World bank and the International Monetary Fund say the two institutions will discuss in September Zimbabwe's bid for support for a new phase of economic reforms after studying its 18-month 1997/1998 budget.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa will present his second budget since being appointed to the post 15 months ago. The budget covers 18 months from this month as Zimbabwe seeks to convert its financial year to the calendar year in 1999.</p>
<p>The World Bank and the IMF have been pressing President Robert Mugabe's government to chop back state spending, which currently accounts for about 38 percent of gross domestic product and is seen by many as supporting a political patronage system, to qualify for new aid.</p>
<p>Both institutions supported Zimbabwe's first five-year economic structural adjustment programme (ESAP), but they withdrew just months before it ended in 1995 when Mugabe's government -- whose budget deficit has averaged 10 percent of GDP annually over the past 10 years -- missed some cost-saving targets.</p>
<p>The second phase of ESAP has been put on hold pending progress on the budget deficit, and other issues such as reducing inflation and spending up privatisation of state enterprises.</p>
<p>Callisto Madavo, World Bank vice-president for Africa, said last month it was very important for the future of Zimbabwe to get an early agreement with the IMF. This could unlock other donor support, as well as World Bank balance of payments assistance.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no more urgent business for this country than tackling the budget deficit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>David Cook, the World bank's chief resident representative in Zimbabwe, said last week talks would begin soon after the budget.</p>
<p>IMF representative Robert Franco, who said his organisation had worked with President Mugabe's government on the coming budget, said a new aid package would be discussed in September which would also include benchmarks Harare would have to meet on some key economic targets.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have benchmarks every six months to assess certain indicators such as is inflation coming down, is the deficit coming down, domestic borrowing...&quot; he told state television.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe's annual inflation edged up to 21.4 percent in June from 20.7 percent in May -- against a target of 16 percent -- and local economic analysts expect it to rise to 24 percent in the last two quarters of the year, fuelled by high money supply growth and expected hikes in excise duties.</p>
<p>Murerwa told Reuters early this month that he expects the budget deficit for the financial year ended June 30 to be around 10.3 percent, way off a target of 8.5 percent.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe also missed its deficit target of 6.7 percent in 1995/96, hitting 10.1 percent.</p>
<p>But this time Murerwa says the government will deliver on its promises.</p>
