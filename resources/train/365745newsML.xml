<title>JAPAN: Dlr to look for new direction in Asia.</title>
<headline>Dlr to look for new direction in Asia.</headline>

<p>The dollar is likely to search for a new direction against the yen in Asia on Monday after weekend meeting of Group of Seven (G7) nations signalled their desire for stability in currency rates by saying that their currencies were no longer out of line in a major way, dealers said.</p>
<p>The G7 statement should make traders cautious about taking up fresh dollar positions, although the downside could be supported by Japanese importer buying.</p>
<p>The dollar fell almost to 120 yen in early Asia on Monday, but rose back to mid-122 yen because of strong purchases by Japanese importers who had failed to buy dollars before.  </p>
<p>&quot;We reaffirmed our view that exchange rates should reflect fundamentals and that excess volatility is undesirable,&quot; the G7 statement added.</p>
<p>&quot;The G7 statement does not mean there will be a strong yen trend,&quot; said a trust bank dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;But caution over the dollar's rise will grow because such moves may create a possibility of trade friction with the United States,&quot; he added. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin gave some indication of how much of a fall in the dollar he might be willing to accept when he declared that the U.S. currency has been strong &quot;for some time now.&quot;  </p>
<p>Dealers said they would focus on Japanese exporters' moves, with some dealers saying they are likely to sell dollars at 122 yen level.</p>
<p>The trust bank dealer said Japanese investors may become slightly bearish on their U.S. investments, which may make the dollar's topside heavy.</p>
<p>Dealers said they had expected Japan to face difficulties in getting strong support on currencies from other nations at the meeting, but in fact the outcome looked opposite.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an impression that other nations made a concession to Japan,&quot; said a city bank dealer.  </p>
<p>Asked about the possibility the Bank of Japan would intervene to sell dollars, possibly with other central banks, if the yen slid further in post-G7 markets, Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the Ministry of Finance's International Finance Bureau said, &quot;we will cooperate, as said in the statement&quot;.</p>
<p>But the G7 statement left open the question as to whether it might intervene in the currency markets at some point to stabilise the dollar, dealers added.</p>
