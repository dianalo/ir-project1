<p>The Indonesian rupiah was soft against the dollar in slow late trading on Friday as liquidity remained largely sufficient, dealers said.</p>
<p>One Japanese bank dealer said the weak rupiah was also partly due to a stronger dollar against the yen, but added that weekly corporate tax payments helped limit the rupiah's fall.</p>
<p>&quot;The rupiah had weakened in the face of the stronger dollar against the Japenese yen, but the weekly corporate payments capped the rupiah's fall,&quot; the Japanese bank dealer.  </p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity was likely to tighten next week as banks were likely to do window-dressing ahead of the half-year book closing.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,431.00/31.40 at 1010 GMT against an opening of 2,430.00/30.75.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2,430.80/31.10 and 2,430.25/30.75, respectively.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said the spot rupiah rate was likely to range between 2,429.50 to 2,430.50 on Monday.  </p>
<p>The central bank, Bank Indonesia, kept its intervention band at 2,425/2,617 and its conversion band at 2,425/2,473 on Friday.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was last at 0.45/0.55 while tom/next was at 0.25/0.30 points.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 13.50/14.25, two at 28.00/29.00, three at 41.50/43.00 and six at 85.50/86.50 points.</p>
