<p>The head of South Africa's state oil firm urged black business on Thursday to invest in the upstream oil industry as part of the country's efforts to narrow the wealth gap between black and white.</p>
<p>Don Mkhwanazi, chairman of Soekor Exploration and Production (Pty) Ltd, issued the call at a seminar for black business leaders aimed at spreading awareness of the opportunities in exploiting South Africa's offshore oil and gas.</p>
<p>&quot;Please... make up your minds to join the energy sector,&quot; Mkhwanazi said, noting that black business had so far concentrated on investing in a limited range of activities.</p>
<p>&quot;All these (black empowerment) deals are confined in only certain sectors of the economy, they are overcrowded in these sectors,&quot; he said, citing telecommunications, financial services, leisure and entertainment, media, food and beverages and mining.</p>
<p>Mkhwanazi acknowledged investing in oil exploration off South Africa carried high risks, but said this was balanced by the potential rewards.</p>
<p>&quot;We are serious about black economic empowerment in South Africa because that is what is going to sustain our democracy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who feel enthusiastic, and have the courage, we would welcome proposals from you.&quot;</p>
<p>Mkhwanazi said Soekor wanted to present Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna with its views on the restructuring of the industry by November.</p>
<p>&quot;We want a national, integrated oil company... like Petronas of Malaysia,&quot; he said. &quot;The new oil company will definitely have a substantial involvement of blacks.&quot;</p>
<p>Soekor divisional manager Willie de Meyer told the seminar the company aimed to make itself profitable so it would become &quot;an ideal candidate&quot; for a form of privatisation.</p>
<p>He said black investment groups could participate with Soekor in developing two blocks off Mossel Bay, one of which is already producing South Africa's first oil, or they could sub-lease other blocks.</p>
<p>Black business leaders at the seminar said few blacks could risk the multi-million-dollar investments envisaged. They said partial privatisation of Soekor and other enterprises in the energy sector would be a more realistic way of achieving black shareholding.</p>
<p>Soekor executives said black groups could form joint ventures with international oil companies which they said were investigating the possibility of exploring South Africa's largely uncharted offshore prospects.</p>
