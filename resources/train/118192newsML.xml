<p>A parliamentary leader of the 39-nation Council of Europe will visit Russia this week to discuss Moscow's progress in bolstering democracy and human rights, the Council said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Leni Fischer, head of the 39-nation Council's parliamentary assembly, would meet Russian leaders including Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, security tsar Alexander Lebed and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Subjects covered will include Russia's role in the Council of Europe, its responsibilities in human rights matters and its progress in putting through democratic reform and establishing the rule of law,&quot; the Council said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposed holding of a second summit of heads of state and government to mark the unification of the European continent will also be discussed,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Russia was allowed to join the Strasbourg-based Council last February despite deep misgivings about its human rights record. Russia has also refused to declare a moratorium on the death penalty as demanded by the parliamentary assembly.</p>
<p>Last month, the Kremlin accused the assembly of meddling in Russia's internal affairs by inviting Chechnya's separatist chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov to Strasbourg along with Lebed to discuss their peace deal for the breakaway region.</p>
<p>Neither man came to the hearing. Fischer, a German, has renewed the invitations to both Maskhadov and Lebed, saying human rights can never be considered a purely domestic issue.</p>
<p>Fischer was in Belarus on Tuesday for two days of talks on the country's application to join the Council, set up after World War Two to promote democracy and human rights.</p>
