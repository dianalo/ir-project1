<p>Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said on Tuesday he did not believe an international conference on conflicts in the African Great Lakes region would bring a quick solution to the Zaire crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;I support the idea of an international conference but it is a medium or long-term arrangement. It cannot solve specific problems in the short run and you must have something more specific to deal with the Zaire situation,&quot; Museveni told a news conference after talks with French President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>France, which has long supported Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, is urgently seeking such a conference to halt hostilities and prevent the break-up of Zaire in chaos.</p>
<p>Museveni said he believed a more immediate solution would be to empower United Nations and Organisation of African Unity envoy Mohammed Sahnoun, backed by &quot;some political heavyweight,&quot; to mediate a cease-fire between Zaire and Tutsi-led rebels.</p>
<p>The rebels have captured a swathe of Zairean territory along the borders with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda and Paris suspects Kampala, with U.S. acquiescence, of aiding and abetting the Rwandan-backed rebels.</p>
<p>Paris believes the key to halting the conflict may lie with Washington which has closel ties with Uganda and Rwanda.</p>
<p>French analysts say the government believes the United States is trying to edge it out of the last region where France still wields influence left over from its colonial past.</p>
<p>After months of transatlantic squabbling over Africa, French officials say the Americans appear to have come round to their view that a collapse of Zaire could de-stabilise the whole of Central Africa and would not be in U.S. interests.</p>
<p>The United States backs the proposed conference. But sceptics say Washington may be paying lip service to the idea to placate Paris while hoping the rebellion will have spread to Kinshasa before the conference gets off the ground.</p>
<p>Asked if he had troops in Zaire, Museveni replied: &quot; There are no Ugandan troops in Zaire and they will never be.&quot; He spoke before Zaire said that a cargo plane carrying Ugandan troops had crashed on its territory.</p>
<p>The United States last week urged all three neighbouring countries to stay out of the fighting. Kinshasa has repeatedly accused its neighbours of direct involvement in the war, which they deny.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem in eastern Zaire is an internal one and it will have to be solved by the Zaireans themselves,&quot; Museveni said.</p>
<p>Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said after the two leaders met for 75 minutes that &quot;The situation is extremely serious and both presidents are worried.&quot;</p>
<p>Questioned about ties with Paris, Museveni said: &quot;If the French have problems with us, they have not said so. I have no problems with the French or any other Europeans. What we want from them is investment, trade and tourism.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he was opposed to foreign spheres of influence in Africa and that African states with French troops on their soil &quot;should learn to stand by themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mind foreign troops if they come for humanitarian purposes... but not for political reasons, not to engage in the internal politics of African countries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Museveni scathingly attacked Sudan's Islamic government which he said &quot;sought to turn Africans into Arabs.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said Uganda would continue to back a regional embargo against Burundi until its government opened talks with the opposition instead of using force against it.</p>
