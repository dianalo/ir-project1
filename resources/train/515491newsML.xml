<p>Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, claiming its restructuring has taken hold, said on Wednesday first quarter sales rose 12 percent and that it expected another gain in operating profit for 1997.</p>
<p>The Stuttgart-based industrial group, maker of Mercedes vehicles, said sales for the first three months of 1997 rose to 25.9 billion marks ($15 billion) from 23.4 billion marks in the 1996 period as all of its divisions contributed to the business expansion.</p>
<p>Daimler said the strong start to 1997 led it to predict another increase in operating profit for the year, in part due to the strength of the dollar since late 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of the good order situation in the first quarter, we expect the pleasing business development to continue in the coming months as well,&quot; Daimler said. &quot;We expect the operating profit to increase yet again this year.&quot;</p>
<p>The German industrial group said its Mercedes passenger car division, which gave 3.1 billion marks to Daimler's 1996 operating profit, was again the top quarterly revenue source.</p>
<p>Despite expectations for limited growth in the vehicle markets in the coming months, Daimler said at its annual news conference that its own business would &quot;develop significantly more favourably than the industry on the whole in 1997&quot;.</p>
<p>Daimler also noted the recovery at its Dasa aerospace unit, which narrowed its consolidated operating loss to 196 million marks in 1996 compared with 7.2 billion marks in 1995, with a 22 percent rise in first quarter sales to 2.83 billion marks and a prediction for sales to &quot;grow markedly&quot; during the year.</p>
<p>Daimler chief executive Juergen Schrempp said in a statement the 1995-launched restructuring programme, which drew criticism for causing job losses, has taken hold and has also shown positive results ahead of expectations.</p>
<p>Daimler reported a 1996 operating profit according to U.S. GAAP accounting rules of 2.42 billion marks for 1996 following an operating loss in 1995 of 7.20 billion marks as Schrempp started the largest corporate restructuring in German history.</p>
<p>But the group said its workforce fell to 287,636 workers in 1996 from 292,478 in 1995, including a loss of nearly 5,100 jobs in the aerospace unit as Daimler shed its troubled Dutch aircraft maker Fokker.</p>
<p>&quot;These decisions are beginning to pay off earlier and more markedly than many expected,&quot; Schrempp said of his plan, which also included merging Mercedes and the remains of the AEG electronics group into the main corporate structure.</p>
<p>&quot;Our productivity and efficiency initiatives are showing their initial success,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Schrempp added: &quot;We also recognise that Daimler-Benz has only completed the first step on the road toward becoming one of the world's leading corporations.&quot;</p>
<p>Daimler chief financial officer Manfried Gentz said deferred tax benefits from the massive losses suffered due to Schrempp's plan boosted 1996 net income by 700 million marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The deferred taxes that have to be included in the financial statement in accordance with American accounting principles had a noticeable impact on net income,&quot; Gentz said in the text of a speech for the news conference.</p>
<p>Among other business units, Daimler said commercial vehicle sales rose nine percent to 8.16 billion marks in the first quarter despite an &quot;extremely difficult&quot; market in Europe.</p>
<p>Daimler's Debis information services divsion reported a 12 percent rise in sales to 3.3 billion marks and its directly managed businesses, which includes a 50 percent stake in rail group Adtranz and engine maker MTU, posted mixed sales results.</p>
