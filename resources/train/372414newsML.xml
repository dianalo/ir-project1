<headline>Talks resume after pilots reject new American offer.</headline>

<p>American Airlines pilots are more likely to strike than not, a union spokesman warned Wednesday, and a federal mediator said contract talks to avert a walkout Friday at the nation's No. 2 carrier were proceeding slowly and with increasing difficulty.</p>
<p>The only hopeful note was sounded by American spokesman Chris Chiames, who said the negotiations were going slowly but that the company thought both sides wanted an agreement.</p>
<p>The pilots resumed the talks after rejecting a new pay offer.</p>
<p>Late in the day, a spokesman for the union, the Allied Pilots Association, said there had been no progress in the negotiations. &quot;A strike is more likely than not,&quot; said spokesman Wally Pitts.</p>
<p>The pilots have vowed to strike if there is no agreement by midnight Friday.</p>
<p>The federal mediator overseeing the negotiations said they were proceeding slowly and &quot;with increasing difficulty.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, President Clinton urged the sides to use the mediation process to resolve their dispute, which he said had huge implications for the country.</p>
<p>American increased its pay offer to 6 percent over four years, from the previous 5 percent. The Allied Pilots Association has asked for 11.5 percent.</p>
<p>The carrier also proposed in a letter to union President James Sovich that one of two stock options offered be kept -- with shares at $10 under market price -- but that the other be dropped.</p>
<p>Airline spokesman Chiames said the offer was to meet an expressed goal of the pilots for more upfront pay rather than benefits later through stock appreciation.</p>
<p>But Sovich rejected the offer, saying it was a step back and would net pilots $43 million less than the previous offer.</p>
<p>Union spokesman David Bates told reporters &quot;we're very disappointed in this offer.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton said he was following the negotiations very closely, adding that &quot;Today, I want to say that the time has not yet expired, and I want to encourage parties to make maximum use of the mediation board process.&quot;</p>
<p>He said &quot;This issue has huge implications for our country, and in particular for specific parts of our country.&quot;</p>
<p>The talks are being held under the auspices of the National Mediation Board, which could declare that a strike would cause major damage to the economy and urge the president to set up an emergency board to try to resolve the lengthy dispute.</p>
<p>Such a board would keep planes flying while it tried to fashion an agreement acceptable to both sides. But if it failed, the union would be free to strike.</p>
<p>In 1993, Clinton stepped into an American dispute with its flight attendants, ending a five-day pre-Thanksgiving Day strike by setting up an emergency board to find a solution.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed to binding abitration.</p>
<p>Aside from pay, also at issue is American's plan for its regional carrier, American Eagle, to use jets to be flown by lower-paid members of another union, a move the Allied Pilots Association opposes.</p>
<p>American has said it needed the jets and lower-paid pilots to remain competitive with other major U.S. carriers that are increasingly dropping turboprop craft for small jets on their commuter services.</p>
<p>The carrier said it was aware of the union's concerns about the introduction of regional jets, and would be flexible in discussing language to deal with those concerns.</p>
<p>A strike is certain to hit air travel hard in many major U.S. cities where American has hubs, disrupting the 200,000 passengers it carries on its 2,200 routes worldwide every day.</p>
<p>Those worst hit would include American's home airport at Dallas-Fort Worth and airports in New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Officials in San Juan said a strike would be devastating to the lucrative Caribbean tourist business, now at its mid-winter height. They said American and American Eagle provide 70 percent of the region's aviation services.</p>
<p>&quot;If there's a strike, you are talking about big layoffs, closures and massive losses of revenue,&quot; said a Caribbean Hotel Association official.</p>
<p>American has said it had made arrangements for its tickets to be accepted by other airlines, but travel agents say there would not likely be be enough free seats on other carriers to handle all the stranded American passengers.</p>
<p>The American Society of Travel Agents urged Clinton to call on both sides to accept binding arbitration.</p>
<p>American and its pilots union had reached a tentative accord last September, but the rank-and-file rejected it in December, leading to the strike deadline and the federally-mediated crisis talks.</p>
<p>Sovich said the board of the pilots union had been scheduled to travel from union heaquarters in Dallas to Washington Thursday, but would be on hand Wednesday. Board action is needed for approval of any settlement.</p>
