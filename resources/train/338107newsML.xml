<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi acknowledged the depth of German public disquiet on Tuesday at the prospect of Italian membership of Europe's single currency and said he would take every step to dispel the doubts.</p>
<p>Reaffirming Italy's intention to be among founder members of the new euro from 1999, Prodi proposed moving the deadline for parliamentary passage of the country's 1998 budget forward by four months to mid-August to boost confidence.</p>
<p>He said the move not only would reassure financial markets that Italy was serious about putting its finances in order but would also give &quot;German voters and the German political world a pretty long time&quot; to consider the country's merits.</p>
<p>&quot;I know very well that German public opinion is against (Italian membership). There's no need to tell me,&quot; Prodi told foreign journalists in Rome.</p>
<p>He said the misgivings were fuelled by a perception that the euro would be weaker than the German mark it will replace if Italy and Spain join the European monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;We must demonstrate the opposite,&quot; Prodi said.</p>
<p>&quot;The question I ask is what is Europe without Italy and Spain...The euro cannot be a currency simply between France and Germany. That is not enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Prodi has alluded before to German misgivings but his comments on Tuesday were among his most explicit.</p>
<p>They coincided with remarks by Juergen Stark, State Secretary at the German Finance Ministry, that some aspirants should forsake the political prestige of entering EMU at the outset and instead watch from the sidelines until ready to join.</p>
<p>&quot;For me the markets have overdone expectations that a large number of countries can qualify,&quot; Stark said. &quot;We have to make sure that these countries also stand for stability. Only then does this project have a lasting chance of success.&quot;</p>
<p>Stark, number two to Finance Minister Theo Waigel and a hard-liner on monetary union, did not name names, but his comments appeared directed at countries like Italy or Spain that have yet to establish a track record of exchange rate stability.</p>
<p>Prodi is scheduled to meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for talks in Bonn on February 7 and said he had no problem with Kohl's stated policy that countries should be judged on their EMU fitness early in 1998 on the basis of their 1997 accounts.</p>
<p>He appeared, however, to take a dig at the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, some of whose officials have questioned the merits of involving Italy and Spain in EMU from the start.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe it is an enormous mistake to entrust the anxiety of the public to central bankers,&quot; Prodi said.</p>
<p>Prodi, appointed last May to head a centre-left government, has vowed he will resign if Italy fails to make the grade for founder membership of the euro.</p>
<p>Missing the start would make the lira a target of currency speculation and re-ignite inflation, Prodi said.</p>
<p>A key criterion for EMU membership will be whether a country's 1997 public deficit is within three percent of its gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Many economists doubt whether Italy can meet the three percent ratio this year despite a tough 62.5 trillion lire ($38 billion) budget. Prodi himself has said a mini-budget is probable following a deficit overshoot in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We will look at the figures and if it's necessary we'll do it,&quot; he said.</p>
