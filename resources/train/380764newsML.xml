<p>Shares on Jordan's stock exchange rose 0.27 percent in the busiest trade for a month on Saturday, driven up by demand for blue-chip banking and pharmaceutical shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>The official Amman Financial Market (AFM) index rose for the fifth consecutive trading day, gaining 0.43 points to close at another 14-month high of 157.67 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The 1996 bank results were good and there's a general demand for blue-chips,&quot; said analyst Mohammad Abdallah of Pearl Investment.</p>
<p>Saturday's turnover was 1.50 million dinars ($2.12 million), the highest level since early January when trading eased during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>Arab Pharmaceutical Chemicals, Saturday's busiest stock, rose by the maximum daily limit of five percent to 1.61 dinars in trade worth 197,000 dinars. Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturers also gained 0.07 dinars to 3.94 dinars in high turnover.</p>
<p>Arab Bank and Housing Bank both closed unchanged at 263.50 dinars and 4.90 dinars after busy trade and Bank of Jordan, which announced healthy 1996 results, gained 0.06 dinars to close at 3.41 dinars.</p>
<p>Overall shares in 24 companies rose, six fell, and another 16 traded but closed unchanged.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 most-traded shares on the exchange rose 0.61 percent to 83.45 points.</p>
