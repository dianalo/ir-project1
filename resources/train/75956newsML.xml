<p>The European Union must not scrap the cumulative limit for pesticides in water when it revises the 1980 drinking water directive, the European Parliament's environment committee will say next month.</p>
<p>A European Commission proposal to revise the directive -- COM(94)612 -- retains the existing limit of 0.1 microgrammes of pesticide per litre for individual pesticides but scraps the 0.5 microgrammes per litre cumulative total.</p>
<p>But the parliament's environment committee is set on October 30 to approve a report which insists the cumulative ceiling must be reinstated.</p>
<p>The draft report, prepared by British Socialist Ken Collins, insists the EU must not relax its pressure on the member states to clean up their water supplies, especially in the light of their dismal record of compliance with the existing directive.</p>
<p>Collins cites European Environmental Agency figures showing that pesticide limits in drinking water have been exceeded on 75 percent of the EU's arable land, and that nitrates have increased in more than 66 percent of the EU's rivers and most of its lakes.</p>
<p>One of the Commission's main proposals for improving drinking water quality is an 80 percent cut in the permitted lead content, mostly from replacing lead pipes and fittings.</p>
<p>The Commission estimates this could cost the member states more than 50 billion Ecus. Collins suggests money should be made available from the Structural Funds for certain regions to help them foot the bill.</p>
<p>But they should have 10 years to bring their water up to scratch, Collins says, not 15 as proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p>Unlike the Commission, Collins does not believe governments should be able to force householders to replace lead pipes on their property.</p>
<p>Instead, he thinks they should report to the Commission &quot;on the incidence of lead piping in households and come forward within five years with a plan to replace the lead piping in these homes&quot;.</p>
<p>The proposal is one of two water policy initiatives the parliament plans to consider at its November plenary session under the cooperation procedure.</p>
<p>The other, a Commission proposal to clean up Europe's bathing waters -- COM(94)36 -- is also due to be examined by the environment committee on October 30.</p>
<p>The two proposals are &quot;daughter directives&quot; to a planned framework directive on the EU's overall water policy, which the parliament is due to consider at its October 21-25 plenary session.</p>
