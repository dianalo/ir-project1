<p>Less than a year ago, the Czech Republic stunned the soccer world by taking Germany to the limit in the European championship final.</p>
<p>Now, with only four points from four games, the beaten Euro 96 finalists face elimination from the 1998 World Cup in France as they prepare for Sunday's qualifier against Spain.</p>
<p>&quot;The team just doesn't seem to have the spark it did at the Euro 96,&quot; said Frantisek Cernoch, a Czech soccer historian who has been covering the national team for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>The Czechs, playing together as a national team for the first time, captured the hearts of fans at home and abroad in England last year before eventually losing to Germany in extra time.</p>
<p>They then kicked off their quest for a World Cup berth in style with a 6-0 win over lowly Malta. But they have since faltered, with a scoreless draw against group leaders Spain and two defeats to Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>&quot;When the qualification matches started last fall...our opponents were really fired up to play us because we had just finished second (at Euro 96),&quot; said Czech assistant coach Ivo Viktor.</p>
<p>Playing in their first major tournament, players used Euro 96 as a stage to showcase talents that had been hidden in the obscurity of the low-paying, lowly regarded Czech first division for years.</p>
<p>Many moved on to Europe's biggest, and wealthiest clubs including Karel Poborsky (Manchester United), Patrik Berger (Liverpool), Pavel Nedved (Lazio) and Radek Bejbl (Atletico Madrid).</p>
<p>But the moves, said Cernoch, have brought new, and sometimes conflicting styles of play into the Czech camp, making old team mates appear as though they are playing together for the first time.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes a while to adjust to the new styles that players such as Berger and Podborsky (who both played at Slavia Prague) are now playing in,&quot; said Cernoch.</p>
<p>&quot;And just when they begin to fit in with their new clubs, they must re-adjust for national team games. They are excellent players, but it just takes time to come together.&quot;</p>
<p>With the postponement of the Czechs's match against Slovakia on May 21, due to a request from Germany's Schalke 04 to allow midfielders Jiri Nemec and Radoslav Latal to play in the UEFA Cup final, Viktor is hoping the extra time will allow the players to play as a team, just as in England last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Every player will have to play his absolute best. The teamwork will have to be perfect and we will have to enjoy some luck as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Czechs, already depleted by the loss of midfielders Bejbl and Berger, suffered a further blow on Wednesday when Kaiserlautern striker Pavel Kuka and Racing Strasbourg defender Jan Suchoparek were ruled out by injury.</p>
<p>Spain lead group six with 16 points, while Yugoslavia are on 15 points from six matches and Slovakia third on 12 points. Only the top team in each group is guaranteed a spot in the World Cup.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to work for a miracle,&quot; Kaiserslautern striker Pavel Kuka said in assessing the team's prospects which only 11 months ago looked as shiny as their silver Euro 96 medals.</p>
