<p>Downhill ace Luc Alphand was fastest in the first training run and second best in the final run on Tuesday as he prepared to take a giant step on Wednesday toward winning the World Cup overall crown.</p>
<p>The flying Frenchman, a Vail downhill winner two years ago, led the field on the 2,704-metre Vail Mountain course in one minute 39.94 in the first run and then posted a time of 1:39.61, bettered only by Kristian Ghedina of Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;As usual, I didn't take so much risk in the training,&quot; said Alphand, who stood up at the end of his second run on a tame course that is set up the same way for the women as for the men.</p>
<p>Ghedina, seventh fastest earlier, registered the best time on the spring-like day with a second run of 1:39.07.</p>
<p>Austrians Fritz and Josef Strobl were third and fourth fastest with times of 1:39.81 and 1:39.89, respectively.</p>
<p>The Austrians, virtually shut out at the Sestriere world championships, posted the next five fastest times behind Alphand in the opening run.</p>
<p>Alphand, who has already clinched the season's downhill title with four victories, is closing in on history.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old racer, who holds a 117-point lead in the overall standings ahead of 1994 champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway, would become the first Frenchman since legend Jean-Claude Killy in 1968 to win the overall crown and would be the first speed specialist ever to claim the honour.</p>
<p>Aamodt, the only rival left for Alphand in the overall standings, was 10th fastest in the first run and 16th in the last.</p>
<p>Exhausted by the chase that took him to Japan last week in the hunt for points, Aamodt said he hoped being back in Vail, where he clinched his overall title in 1994, would revive him.</p>
<p>&quot;I am always happy to be back on this course on which I celebrated such a great moment,&quot; said the 25-year-old Norwegian who arrived here Monday after an arduous trip from Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;My chance to win the trophy again this year is really low. Alphand would be a great, outstanding overall World Cup winner. He has won so many races. I hope to be racing as good as him when I am his age.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year's overall champion, Lasse Kjus of Norway, did not take part in the training runs in protest against the travel schedule which had the all-rounders racing in three continents in three weeks.</p>
<p>Despite a crush of more than 20 French journalists anticipating his triumph in the overall, Alphand said he was feeling free and easy.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no pressure,&quot; he said. &quot;I already achieved what I set out to do, to win the downhill title for the third year in a row. Anything else is icing on the cake. The overall is only a bonus.&quot;</p>
<p>Alphand, who arrived here on Saturday, said he was well rested and comfortable on the Vail course.</p>
<p>&quot;I have one advantage, Aamodt is tired coming back from Japan. I am rested and I have a good lead,&quot; he said about the overall. &quot;At the same time, Aamodt has four chances (to score points).&quot;</p>
