<p>Hungarian government security yields on the secondary market were seen remaining steady this week or changing only slightly, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondary market prices did not move much last week and I expect the same for this week,&quot; said Zsolt Bango of Gog Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The market over-reacted a little to recent inflation figures,&quot; said Tamas Puskas of Raiffeisen Securities.</p>
<p>The Central Statistical Office announced two weeks ago that September year-on-year inflation was 21 percent, down from 22.2 percent in September.</p>
<p>Dealers said last week's one- and three-month discount Treasury bill auctions have not given the market stimuli.</p>
<p>But a larger-than-expected drop in the yield of three-year government bonds at Thursday's auction was followed by a fall of 50 to 70 basis points in three-year yields to 21.5-21.6 percent, they said.</p>
<p>Discount Treasury bill yields dropped 10 to 20 basis points to 22.1-22.2 percent by Monday afternoon, they added.</p>
<p>Traders saw little room for further falls in the near future, with inflation forecast at 18 percent for 1997, and a market where liquidity was likely to tighten in December.</p>
<p>Dealers said yields on government security with longer maturities fell more sharply recently than on short-term papers, indicating the market view that inflation would fall further.</p>
<p>&quot;Yields could drop to 21 percent by January only if the government's economic policies are convincing,&quot; said Creditanstalt's Gabor Szogi, adding that in the near future he did not see substantial drops in yields.</p>
<p>Puskas said that government bond yields could be even corrected slightly upwards on the secondary market this week.</p>
