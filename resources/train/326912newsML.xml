<p>Tokyo stocks opened with robust gains on Wednesday, as a rebound by stock futures in Chicago overnight sparked short-covering.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market had found support slightly above 17,000 and there was little fear of a further drop for now.</p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 average rose 239.66 points or 1.38 percent to 17,597.82 in the first five minutes of trading.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nikkei is likely to recover today, as its futures bounced back in Chicago,&quot; an analyst at a second-tier Japanese securities house said.</p>
<p>But traders in the futures market said the rebound in Chicago was somewhat technical and that the overall market was likely to remain directionless.</p>
<p>On Tuesday in Chicago, the Nikkei 225's March futures closed at 17,645, up 315 points from their close in Osaka on Tuesday and up 305 points from their previous close in Chicago.</p>
