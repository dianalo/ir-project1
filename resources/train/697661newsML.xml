<title>MALAYSIA: Prime Utilities rating lowered to BBB2.</title>
<headline>Prime Utilities rating lowered to BBB2.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-06-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Rating Agency Malaysia (RAM) said on Monday it has downgraded sewerage treatment firm Prime Utilities Bhd's five-year bond issue to BBB2 from A3.</p>
<p>It said in a statement that Prime Utilities, which had been put under rating watch some time ago, was downgraded due to uncertainty over the company's earnings from its wholly-owned subsidiary Indah Water Konsortium, concessionnaire for the privatised sewerage services.  </p>
<p>Prime Utilities issued the 60 million ringgit redeemable unsecured bonds last year.</p>
<p>It said various policy reviews by the government, due to which Indah had to write off 33 months of revenue before January 1, 1997, had affected its rating.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the beginning of its operations on April 1, 1994, IWK has faced a spate of problems in collecting its bills,&quot; RAM said in the statement.</p>
<p>By October 31, 1996, IWK had only been able to collect 113 million ringgit of the 256 million billed to consumers.</p>
<p>IWK was acquired by Prime in November, 1995. IWK has a 28-year concession to manage the country's sewerage services.</p>
<p>In the current year, its first full year of billings, no data was yet available on bill collections, a key area of risk for Prime Utilities, RAM said.</p>
<p>After the write-off of revenues, the government has extended IWK's lease by 33 months and has also given it a soft loan of 450 million ringgit.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to the substantial write-off of past revenue, it is certain that Prime Utilities will declare a substantial loss in financial year 1997,&quot; RAM said.</p>
