<p>Toronto stocks closed firmer on Tuesday as foreign investors snapped up Canadian issues after the ruling Liberal Party secured another majority government in Monday's federal election.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 26.64 points to close at 6432.72. Total volume was 93.3 million shares worth C$1.4 billion ($1.02 billion).</p>
<p>Despite winning a bare majority, foreign investors cheered the Liberal victory as a sign that the government's deficit reduction program would continue, said Maison Placements Canada trader Rolie Bradley.</p>
<p>&quot;From a foreigner's perspective, it's a majority government,&quot; Bradley said. &quot;The game plan continues.&quot;</p>
<p>Bradley added that stocks with the largest market value led the Canadian market higher.</p>
<p>Eleven of Toronto's 14 sub-sectors gained ground, led by conglomerates, consumer products, media and utilities. The three weak groups were golds, industrial products and transportation.</p>
<p>Advancing stocks outnumbered declines 509 to 447, while 290 issues were flat.</p>
<p>Among individual issues, Stelco Inc. topped Toronto's most-active list and closed steady at 10.35 on 3.4 million shares.</p>
<p>Algoma Steel Inc. followed in heavy trading, up 0.25 at 9.05. Investors were betting that a stronger economy will boost demand for steel by manufacturers, analysts said.</p>
<p>Telecommunications conglomerate BCE Inc., Canada's largest publicly traded firm, rose 0.80 to 38.00.</p>
<p>Nickel giant Inco Ltd. gained 0.25 to close at 44.65 after its Sudbury, Ontario, workers rejected a contract offer and walked off the job.</p>
<p>The production shutdown caused a brief rally in nickel prices which boosted Inco's stock, analysts said.</p>
