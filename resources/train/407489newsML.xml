<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Thursday chaired a meeting of Islamist and secular Palestinian factions in the West Bank in the first national dialogue in five years, organisers said.</p>
<p>The meeting which brought together senior leaders of groups that support Israeli-PLO peace moves and opponents came one day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government gave the green light to build a new neighbourhood for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem, threatening Israeli-PLO peace moves.</p>
<p>Palestinians said the participants hoped to agree on a document that would become the reference for Israeli-PLO talks on a permanent peace agreement, due to resume next month.</p>
<p>&quot;This meeting is between the Palestinian political factions and the (Palestinian) Authority concerning (organising) Palestinian political life and to assess the situation after the Israeli decision to build a settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim,&quot; said Saeb Erekat, a minister in the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>No details were available on what they discussed in the four-and-a-half hour meeting that had been arranged several weeks ago. The last time such a meeting took place was in Tunis in December 1992 after Israel deported more than 400 Islamist activists to south Lebanon.</p>
<p>Palestinians said that representatives of the Islamic Hamas group, the Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and Arafat's Fatah movement were among several factions taking part in the talks. The Islamic Jihad was absent.</p>
<p>One PFLP participant said the group wanted to raise a number of issues, including the subject of political freedoms as well as establishing a framework for the talks with Israel.</p>
<p>But he insisted that groups opposed to the Israeli-PLO peace deals would maintain their stands.</p>
<p>Relations between PLO and leftist and Islamic groups soured after Arafat signed a self-rule deal with Israel in 1993.</p>
<p>Ties plunged further over the Palestinian Authority's repeated crackdowns on militant Palestinian organisations following attacks against Israelis.</p>
<p>&quot;Our unity is a matter of life or death, especially under the present and most serious stage we live in,&quot; Palestinian Legislative Council speaker Ahmed Korei said in a speech at the opening session of the two-day meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The meetings of the Palestinian dialogue are a chance for all the Palestinian forces to come up with results that would serve our people,&quot; said Jamal Mansour, a leader of Hamas which has violently opposed the peace deals.</p>
