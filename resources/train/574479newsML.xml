<p>Twice world champion Michael</p>
<p>Schumacher took the lead in the world drivers' championship on</p>
<p>Sunday with a masterful victory in the Monaco Grand Prix.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old German led from the start in his Ferrari in</p>
<p>a wet race which, as in 1996, reduced the field to only a</p>
<p>handful of runners at the finish.</p>
<p>He romped home 53 seconds ahead of Brazilian Rubens</p>
<p>Barrichello in a Stewart.</p>
<p>Barrichello's fine drive, which earned his team their first</p>
<p>world championship points, put him ahead of Briton Eddie Irvine</p>
<p>in the second Ferrari with last year's winner, Frenchman Olivier</p>
<p>Panis, fourth in a Prost.</p>
<p>Mika Salo of Finland, driving a Tyrrell, was fifth with</p>
<p>Italian Giancarlo Fisichella in a Jordan sixth.</p>
<p>Schumacher's win ended the Italian team's long wait for a</p>
<p>Monaco victory. It was their first win on the streets of the</p>
<p>Mediterranean principality since Gilles Villeneuve triumphed in</p>
<p>1981 and it helped them celebrate the 50th anniversary of the</p>
<p>team this month.</p>
<p>But it was a disastrous race for Williams who have not won</p>
<p>in Monaco since 1983. Both former championship leader Jacques</p>
<p>Villeneuve of Canada and team mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen of</p>
<p>Germany, who started from pole position, failed to finish.</p>
<p>Schumacher's win lifted him to 24 points in the championship</p>
<p>ahead of Villeneuve on 20 while in the constructors' race</p>
<p>Ferrari now lead with 38 to Williams' total of 30.</p>
<p>The win was the 23rd of Schumacher's career and came in his</p>
<p>90th race.</p>
