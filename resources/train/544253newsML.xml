<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS --flat but vulnerable to data.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bonds were flat in early afternoon trade on Monday, but prices were vulnerable ahead of crucial economic data that could help determine if another monetary tightening is around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that once you get this week's numbers, you're going to have in hand pretty much what the Federal Reserve is going to do,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>At present, he explained, the market judges the odds of another interest rate increase at around 50 to 60 percent, but unexpectedly sharp rises in the first quarter employment cost index, scheduled to be released on Tuesday at 0830 EDT, or the April payrolls report, due out on Friday at 0830 EDT, could drive that estimate up to an 80 to 90 percent probability.</p>
<p>The employment cost index, which economists view as a useful yardstick for measuring the overall costs of a workforce, was predicted at up 0.9 percent, according to a consensus survey of economists by Reuters.</p>
<p>And the March payrolls data were estimated to rise 211,000, up from February's gain of 175,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate was predicted flat at 5.2 percent.</p>
<p>Until the second economic report is released on Friday, prices might have a hard time breaking out of recent ranges. &quot;I think you're probably going to be within one- to a half-point range before Friday,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>The day-to-day calender includes some large issues, like $192 million sale of revenue bonds by Orange County, Calif., but when they might be sold depends largely on the direction of interest rates.</p>
<p>And with the recent rise in yields, traders speculated that some issues might be postponed. This week's calender was expected to total $2.4 billion in 88 sales, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the calender is going to be as huge as everyone thinks it's going to be. Unless we get a run-up in the market, this stuff is on hold,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Activity was subdued in municipal bonds, with only a handful of fairly modest bid-wanted lists being circulated, traders said.</p>
<p>Some potential buyers still appeared to be favoring the long-end as they searched for yields, and this preference might help New York City's Muncipal Water Finance Authority sale of $640 million of bonds on Tuesday, as the deal is structured towards longer maturities.</p>
<p>In the U.S. government cash market, the benchmark 30-year bond rose three ticks to 93-23/32 to yield 7.14 percent.</p>
<p>In debt futures, the June Municipal contracts were steady at 112-7/32, while the June T-bond contracts rose three ticks to 107-7/32.</p>
<p>The MOB spread was at plus 160 ticks, down slightly from late levels seen on Friday.</p>
