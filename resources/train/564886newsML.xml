<title>BELGIUM: Belgian OLOs look to jobless data for direction.</title>

<p>Belgian linear bonds drifted at slightly higher levels in early Tuesday dealings, with the market's attention focused on German jobless data due to be released around 0755 GMT.</p>
<p>German April unemployment is widely expected to have fallen slightly from March's seasonally-adjusted 4.298 million level.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's hope it does something to move the market because there's no life at the moment,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The market was suffering from lack of interest by end investors and needed something to give it a kick, he added.  </p>
<p>With the Belgian market closed on Thursday and Friday and with little U.S. data on the agenda beforehand, many investors appear to have taken the week off.</p>
<p>Traders noted, however, that next week was certain to be busier, with a hefty amount of OLOs expected to be offered at the May 13 exchange auction.</p>
<p>It is the last time the Treasury will have to reduce the 98 billion Belgian francs of outstanding OLO 15 before the 6.75 percent bond matures on May 25. The other bond on offer, the 9.25 percent August 1997 OLO 8, has 82 billion francs outstanding.</p>
