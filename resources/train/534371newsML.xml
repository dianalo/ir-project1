<p>NYMEX electricity futures were called to open lower Thursday, extending Wednesday's losses tied to softer cash market prices and forecasts of cool temperatures moving across the Southwest.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people are saying 'It's about time this is coming off',&quot; said a West Coast paper broker, noting next-day cash prices in the West continued to soften in early activity.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter business, May California-Oregon Border (COB) futures were quoted at $13.35-13.60 a megawatt hour (MWh) against a previous settlement at $13.55, while May Palo Verde (PV) at $17.75-18.00 versus yesterday's close at $18.23.</p>
<p>June COB futures, in the paper market, were assessed at $12.10-12.50 and June PV near $18.00.</p>
<p>Despite Wednesday's losses, May contracts remained within upchannels that were established more than a month ago.</p>
<p>Brokers and traders said trading of May power futures, which go off the board tomorrow, could be volatile depending on the direction of underlying cash prices and today's expiration of the May Henry Hub natural gas futures.</p>
<p>The May Henry Hub contract opened down 0.5 cent at $2.055 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it has trimmed water outflow at the 6,150 megawatt (MW) Grand Coulee hydropower project due to concerns about potential downstream flooding. The reduction is not expected to have a noticeable impact on hydroelectric production.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, the 550 MW unit 4 at the Jim Bridger generating complex in Wyoming returned online, while the plant's 550 MW unit 1 was in the process of restart.</p>
<p>The 408 MW unit 3 at the Craig power plant in Colorado is set to startup today following its spring maintenance outage.</p>
<p>Even with those units' return, about 9,000 megawatts (MW) of coal and nuclear generating capacity in the West are still offline for refueling, maintenance and/or repairs.</p>
<p>Main coastal cities from Seattle down to Los Angeles are expected to enjoy sunny, warm weather with readings running in the 60-70 degrees Fahrenheit into the weekend.</p>
<p>Ski resorts in the Rockies such Aspen and Vail are predicted to see snowfall and wintery temperatures in the 20s-30s through Sunday.</p>
