<p>Merrill Lynch in London has raised its 1997 and 1998 earnings forecasts for Polish bank BIG SA, which it sees making a consolidated 1997 net income of 199 million zlotys with a return on equity of 31 percent.</p>
<p>Merrill did not give its previous earnings and ROE forecasts in its report dated March 18 but raised its 1997 earnings-per-share forecast to 0.86 zlotys compared to 0.84 zlotys in a report a week ago.</p>
<p>Merrill said the new forecasts reflected BIG's proposed capital increase of up to 75 million shares and its consolidation of Bank Gdanski, in which it raised its stake by 31.9 percent to 63 percent last month.</p>
<p>&quot;In our view, the market has reacted to BIG's proposed rights issue but not considered the gain in income brought by the Gdanski acquisition,&quot; said the report which kept Merrill's accumulate rating for BIG.</p>
<p>Last year BIG made a consolidated net profit of 110 million zlotys.</p>
<p>Merrill said that at the time of the report, BIG shares, which then cost 4.05 zlotys, were trading at a 10-15 percent discount to its price/net asset value and dividend discount model target values, and at discounts of over 50 percent relative to other Polish banks.</p>
<p>BIG closed on Wednesday at 4.05 zlotys as well.</p>
<p>Merrill lowered its 1997 price-earnings ratio for BIG to 4.7 from 5.2 in a report a week ago.</p>
<p>It forecast a 1.04-zloty eps for BIG next year and a P/E of 3.9 on a net income of 243 million zlotys.</p>
<p>Merrill said its forecasts were &quot;rather rough&quot; and that it expected to refine them after BIG's shareholders meeting, which took place on Tuesday, and Merrill's meeting with management in early April.</p>
<p>The Tuesday shareholders meeting approved a new issue of up to 75 million shares.</p>
