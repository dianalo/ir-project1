<headline>Goodyear to buy stakes in Slovenian tire group.</headline>
<dateline>AKRON, Ohio</dateline>
<text>
<p>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. said on Monday it agreed to buy controlling stakes in two units of Sava Group in the Republic of Slovenia.</p>
<p>The company said it was acquiring a 60 percent interest in Sava's tire business and a 75 percent stake in its engineered products business.</p>
<p>Goodyear did not disclose the value of the deals, but said the purchase prices would be announced in mid-summer when they are expected to be completed.</p>
<p>It was Goodyear's second major acquisition in Eastern Europe. Last year the company acquired a majority stake in the operations of a Polish tire company, TC Debica.</p>
<p>&quot;The joint venture involving Sava's engineered products business is strategic to Goodyear's growth by providing a European manufacturing based operation,&quot; it said. Currently, the company's customers are supplied with products from other regions.</p>
<p>Sava Group reported total sales of $245 million in 1996, of which $177 million was for car and commercial truck tires.</p>
