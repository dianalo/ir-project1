<p>Brazil's consolidated public sector operational deficit widened to 3.47 percent of gross domestic product, or 28.552 billion reais, in the 12 months to May, the Central Bank said Monday.</p>
<p>The Central Bank said in a statement that the operational public sector deficit in the 12 months before April was equivalent to 3.39 percent of GDP.  </p>
<p>The deterioration in the operational result, which includes interest payments on Brazil's massive debt stock, was largely the fault of the federal government and the Central Bank, the statement said.</p>
<p>It said the operational deficit of the federal government widened to 1.7 percent of GDP in May from 1.57 percent of GDP in the previous month.</p>
<p>States and municipalities narrowed their operational deficit to 1.47 percent of GDP in May, compared with 1.53 percent of GDP in April, while the operational deficit of state firms remained steady at 0.29 percent of GDP.  </p>
<p>The public sector's primary result, which does not include debt servicing, improved to a slight surplus of 0.08 percent of GDP from being balanced in April, the Central Bank said.</p>
<p>As for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), the shortfall was 45.483 billion reais, or 5.53 percent of GDP in the 12 months to the end of May, it said.</p>
<p>That compared with a PSBR of 46.362 billion reais, or 5.67 percent of GDP in the 12 months to April. In the 12 months to May 1996, the PSBR was the equivalent of 7.8 percent of GDP.  </p>
<p>The net public sector debt in May stood at 282.095 billion reais, or 34.2 percent of GDP. That was slightly down from 282.703 billion reais, or 34.5 percent of GDP, the previous month.</p>
<p>The bank said net internal debt was 248.385 billion reais, or 30.1 percent of GDP, up from 245.198 billion reais, or 30 percent of GDP in April.</p>
<p>Net external debt slipped to 33.71 billion reais, or 4.1 percent of GDP, in May from 37.505 billion reais, or 4.6 percent of GDP, in April.  </p>
<p>The bank said Brazil's monetary base, according to daily averages, expanded 1.0 percent in June to 24.706 billion reais. In end-of-month terms, the expansion was 13.4 percent.</p>
<p>M1, the narrowest definition of money supply, was 37.482 billion reais in June, compared with 36.544 billion reais in May while M4, the broadest aggregate, expanded to 351.302 billion reais from 343.37 billion reais the previous month.</p>
