<p>French stocks closed weaker on Wednesday with a lower Wall Street opening accentuating the consolidation after Tuesday's year high.</p>
<p>Several bank stocks bucked the trend, however, amid revived investor interest in the sector in the wake of news that Axa and UAP plan to merge to create the world's second biggest insurer.</p>
<p>The two insurers' are set to grab the trading spotlight on Thursday when they resume trading after suspension due to their announcement of a merger.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 11.94 points or 0.54 percent at 2,217.19 while the CAC-40 futures contract was down 6.0 at 2,234.0 at 1619 GMT. Volume was a healthy 5.77 billion francs.</p>
<p>Oil stocks Elf and Total provided the focus for the bulk of trading after the government sale of 24.9 million Elf shares weighed on the Elf stock, with a knock-on effect on Total.</p>
<p>&quot;Elf was by far the most active stock but the banks were all very active as well,&quot; said one trader. &quot;With Axa and UAP trading again tomorrow insurance is likely to be active.&quot;</p>
<p>Index heavyweight Elf opened 1.2 percent weaker after the government said it had sold off 24.9 million Elf shares for 10 billion francs, with Elf indirectly-controlled Fingestval buying back 4.5 percent. Stock recovered to close down 0.49 percent.</p>
<p>Credit Commercial de France ended 2.09 percent up after surging well past three percent higher earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the rise to renewed interest in French banks and CCF as a plausible takeover target if restructuring speeds up. &quot;It's a good bank but probably not quite big enough,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Societe Generale and Paribas also rose on positive sentiment in wake of Axa/UAP deal.</p>
