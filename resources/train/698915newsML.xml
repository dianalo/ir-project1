<title>SINGAPORE: Singapore lowers petrol prices after two years.</title>
<headline>Singapore lowers petrol prices after two years.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Singapore petrol retailers are reducing their pump prices for the first time in around two years amid soft international prices since early June, industry sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mobil Oil Singapore, the first to reduce prices on July 1, dropped prices as a result of a &quot;downward trend in wholesale prices&quot;, the company spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>An abundance of supplies have depressed international spot prices for diesel and petrol (gasoline).</p>
<p>In mid-June, diesel prices fell to their lowest since November 1995 while gasoline fell to a 10-month low.  </p>
<p>The three grades of petrol sold in the city state were being reduced by one Singapore cent per litre and diesel by two cents.</p>
<p>The latest price move will lower prices to Singapore $1.216 ($0.85) per litre for the unleaded 98-octane grade, S$1.15 for unleaded 92-octane and S$1.337 for premium leaded and S$0.551 for diesel.</p>
<p>But Singapore pump prices are still one of the highest in Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is softening but in Singapore, we also have to take into consideration property prices and the rising costs of the station sites,&quot; a source said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It has been quite some time since prices fell, but whenever we can afford it, we will pass savings on to the consumer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shell, British Petroleum and Singapore Petroleum Co told Reuters they were planning to lower prices later on Tuesday or on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The remaining two of the six retailers, Exxon Corp and Caltex, a Chevron Corp and Texaco Inc joint venture, were unavailable for comment but sources expected them to follow suit.  </p>
<p>&quot;Everybody will fall into position in a matter of three days,&quot; a source said. &quot;In such a small market you can't hold on too long or you will lose sales and credibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Sources estimated annual petrol retail sales were around 5.3 million barrels and diesel sales around 2.3 million barrels.</p>
