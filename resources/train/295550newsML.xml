<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Thursday.</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE closed slightly lower but at the day's best level, clawing back hefty initial losses after U.S. stocks surged on tame inflation data. Bank stocks led the gainers, helped by more talk of share buybacks and continued positive analyst comment. The FTSE finished 0.5 points lower at 4,087.0 with losers and gainers roughly evenly matched.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Shares closed late electronic trade at record levels after a spate of U.S. economic data finally managed to ease lingering investor fears of a credit tightening in the United States. The IBIS DAX closed at 2,936.69, 32.61 points up on the day, after earlier setting a new record of 2,937.78. The DAX 30 index of leading German shares had earlier closed 13.71 points lower at 2,892.63.</p>
<p>PARIS - Shares finished higher, lifted in the afternoon by strength in U.S. stock and debt markets after opening lower and spending most of the session stuck nearly unchanged. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closer 17.46 points higher at 2,349.08.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares ended at a record close in a split market. The rising dollar supported the industrial sector, which took the whole market higher. Gains in banks and insurers, however, were only marginal. The broad SPI added 12.13 points to 2,539.19.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Share prices plunged, with the key Nikkei market average sliding more than three percent to its lowest close in over a year. The nosedive, the latest in a series of steep stock market tumbles amid deepening gloom about the Japanese economy, was driven by fierce selling of banking shares coupled with rounds of futures-linked selling. The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares ended 606.51 points lower at 18,073.87.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks tumbled to a sharply lower close, rocked by concerns about higher interest rates, government measures to stamp out property speculation and a selloff in Japanese shares. The Hang Seng Index slid 256.82 points, or 1.91 percent, to close at 13,198.11. Turnover was HK$11.41 billion compared with HK$11.37 billion on Wednesday.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Shares swaggered to a higher close, defying a wobbly Wall Street and hitting new highs in the afternoon session before easing back. The All Ordinaries index reached a record high of 2,429.2, however the benchmark failed to break its record close of 2,424.6, adding 8.2 points to 2,423.2 by the end of the day.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - A stronger rand and bond market during the afternoon pushed South African industrial shares into firmer territory after a weak start. Traders said investment funds returned to the market by late morning, continuing a trend started on Wednesday, buying cheap stocks. The industrial index ended up 18.7 points at 8,020.1. The all gold index finished 8.6 points down at 1390.1 and the all share index was down 3.3 points at 6,647.9.</p>
