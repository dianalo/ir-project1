<p>Latin America nations must address deep-seated poverty and wealth inequality undiminished by economic reforms, the head of the Organization of American States said on Thursday.</p>
<p>OAS Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria said vast numbers of Latin Americans have not enjoyed the fruits of economic stabilization and Latin policymakers will focus on the problems at next week's Ibero-America Summit in Chile.  </p>
<p>&quot;The main goals of our efforts (in Chile) should be to strengthen the democratic system and to solve the problems of inequality and poverty,&quot; Gaviria said.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin nations have put in place dramatic stabilization programs that brought to an end years of hyperinflation and economic crisis.</p>
<p>But the benefits of stabilization have not been evenly distributed and signs of discontent can be found in Argentina's recent general strikes, or the emergence of rebel movements in rural Mexico.  </p>
<p>&quot;People are tired of hearing only about economic reform,&quot; Gaviria said after speaking at a Rutgers University conference on the Latin American press.</p>
<p>Gaviria, a former president of Colombia, defended as &quot;indispensible&quot; the economic reforms, but said these changes -- slashing government budgets, selling state enterprises, bringing down inflation -- were only the first step.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic reform was a necessary step,&quot; the OAS head said. &quot;But it hasn't solved the problems of poverty. It hasn't improved the distribution of income.&quot;  </p>
<p>Latin nations must also transform their political systems to give the people a greater voice.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to go through a political reform in Latin America that brings more power to people, that improves the distribution of power between the three branches of government, improves the judicial system and improves the protection of human rights,&quot; Gaviria said.</p>
<p>Joining calls for social development, Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes told the conference that Latin America must attack the roots cause of its problems -- the crushing poverty that affects half the region's population.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to learn that social policies are not a luxury or an abstraction, but an investment of high economic yield,&quot; Fuentes said. &quot;Social policies, when applied, have been the real foundation of macroeconomic success.&quot;</p>
<p>The only remedy to change centuries of inequality in Latin America is the combined effects of political democracy, economic development and social justice, Fuentes said.</p>
