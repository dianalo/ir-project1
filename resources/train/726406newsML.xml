<p>Wall Street stocks finished higher on Monday, with tech stocks extending their torrid run and blue chips scratching out the slenderest of gains.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials rose one point to 7923, led higher for the second straight session by computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co, which gained 3-7/8 to 65-1/16 in New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite jumped more than 21 points, running its streak of consecutive record closes to eight, as investors flocked to the suddenly sizzling tech sector.  </p>
<p>The tech stock rally, which appears to be gaining momentum, faces a critical series of earnings-related tests this week, with reports due from industry bellwether companies Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;We get Intel tomorrow and Microsoft on Thursday,&quot; said Guy Truicko, &quot;and this trend could either break or continue right on, based on what those two companies say.&quot;</p>
<p>Intel warned in late May that its second-quarter earnings would fall short of earlier estimates because of product transition issues. Investors have apparently decided the worst is already passed, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Right now, the market is certainly telling us it expects good news,&quot; Truicko said.</p>
<p>Shares in Intel rose 1-7/8 to 78-3/4 and Microsoft surged 6-3/16 to 135-15/16.</p>
<p>While tech stocks have shot higher, the Dow has stalled a bit, remaining stuck just below 8000 since closing at 7895.81 on July 3.</p>
<p>While analysts are not expecting a sharp, sustained decline by the blue chips, they say the 8000 milestone may remain elusive for a while longer, as investors flock to the tech group, which is suddenly back in favor.  </p>
<p>&quot;Many players in the large caps were there for the short term, and they don't want to be buying here, when a lot of those stocks are quite expensive,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, a lot of the techs had been neglected or just overlooked,&quot; she said. &quot;Once they started going up, people just got more comfortable with them again.&quot;</p>
<p>Quarterly corporate earnings season started in earnest Monday, with a flurry of releases from banking companies that reported profits in line with or slightly above forecasts.  </p>
<p>Among banks reporting Monday were NationsBank Corp, which rose 11/16 to close at 67-5/16, First Chicago NBD Corp, which rose 7/16 to 63-7/16, and Bank of New York Co Inc, which finished up 1/4 at 46-1/8.</p>
<p>Investment bank Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc jumped 1-7/8 to 58-15/16 after reporting earnings of $1.49 per share on a diluted basis, off from $1.53 a year ago but well ahead of First Call's consensus estimate of $1.20.</p>
<p>Health-care information provider HCIA Inc plummeted 16-3/8 to 15-5/8 after saying it expected a second-quarter loss of between $0.15 and $0.18 per share.  </p>
<p>Analysts had expected the company to post a profit of $0.30 per share for the quarter, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Chemicals producer DuPont Co fell 15/16 to 62-5/16 after announcing an agreement to buy several chemicals businesses from Imperial Chemical Industries Plc for a total of $3 billion.</p>
<p>American Depositary shares in Imperial Chemical rose 3-5/8 to 59-7/8.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 1.70 points to 918.38.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 21.26 points to 1523.88.</p>
