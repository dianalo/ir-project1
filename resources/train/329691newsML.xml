<p>London stocks leapt to a new peak in early trade on Thursday as a weaker pound boosted prospects for exporters but other European bourses slipped from recent record levels.</p>
<p>A bruising overnight selloff for sterling in Asia sent it sharply lower from Wednesday's 52-month record against the mark. The dollar, however, remained close to its 2-1/2 year high against the mark.</p>
<p>As London stormed ahead, Paris and Frankfurt fell, pausing for breath after surging on Wednesday when they were helped by the stronger dollar which was seen as good for exporting sectors.</p>
<p>In London, Europe's biggest bourse, the FTSE 100 index climbed to an intra-day peak of 4,244.0, surpassing the record of 4,227.5 set during trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Growing hopes that British interest rates would remain unchanged undermined the pound's recent strength, taking the pressure off overseas earners and exporters.</p>
<p>Investors shrugged off a weak close on Wall Street and were encouraged by major oils stocks, which benefit from a strong dollar, and British Steel, recently subject to savage earnings downgrades because of sterling's strength.</p>
<p>&quot;After all the downgrades we have seen on currency strength, we could even see forecasts being nudged back up again if sterling continues to retreat,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Sterling's decline comes after months of sharp gains in the currency as the prospect of rising British interest rates lured speculative cash into the currency.</p>
<p>But Wednesday's weaker-than-expected British retail sales data changed currency dealers' minds, suggesting British rates could be on hold until after the election due by May.</p>
<p>Sterling was trading at 2.6673 marks in early trading, nearly six pfennigs below its 2.7240 high in late Europe on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We may have seen the top for sterling for the moment at least,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>London's stock gains came despite a weak showing on Wall Street where the Dow ended down 33.87 points at 6,850.03, weighed down by tumbling IBM shares after the computer giant's results were marred by a drop in profit margins.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares fall at the start of bourse trade following the latest German money supply data which came out slightly higher than expected, scotching hopes of a quick interest rate cut.</p>
<p>The DAX share index slipped back by 0.3 percent after closing within a whisker of new peak on Wednesday. Frankfurt has particularly benefited from the stronger dollar because of the large number of exporting firms listed.</p>
<p>French shares were also weaker, slipping into the minus column in early trade. Traders said they expected the market to pause after Wednesday's gain of more than one percent to a new record before resuming its bullish trend.</p>
<p>With the main focus of the currency markets on sterling, the dollar remained virtually unchanged against the mark and yen in early transactions.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency was likely to spend the day trying to consolidate after soaring on Wednesday above 1.6400 marks, analysts said, adding that any correction would be temporary and that there had been no change in the fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic move of dollar strength hasn't changed, and nor have the things that have been driving the dollar higher. We're still expecting weak economic data from Germany because of the cold weather,&quot; said Daiwa Europe senior economist Katy Peters.</p>
<p>Bundesbank policy-makers will hold their regular council meeting today, but the market does not expect them to decide on a cut in interest rates.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1030 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar surged to 119.18 yen and 1.6390 marks from Wednesday's late European levels of 118.91 and 1.6393.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 23.6 points at 4,242.7.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was 1.21 lower at 2,441.25.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was down 9.17 at 3,019.15. PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was at $350.00 an ounce, compared to Wednesday's close of $351.15.</p>
