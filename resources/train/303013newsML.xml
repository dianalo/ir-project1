<p>Boys in the United States tend to start toilet training later than girls, and take longer to get the idea, according to a study published Monday.</p>
<p>A researcher at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine said the parents of 482 toddlers who were questioned every six months as toilet training progressed reported that 59 percent of boys were at least two years old before they began compared to 41 percent of girls.</p>
<p>In addition 48 percent of the boys had not completed training until after the age of three compared to only 30 percent of the girls.</p>
<p>The report, published in &quot;Pediatrics,&quot; the monthly journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, also found that four percent of the children in the study were potty trained by age two, 22 percent by age two and one-half and 88 percent by age three and one-half. Only two percent remained untrained by age four.</p>
