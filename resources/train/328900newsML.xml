<title>SPAIN: Peseta weakens against mark as funds flow north.</title>
<headline>Peseta weakens against mark as funds flow north.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-01-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The recent weakening of the peseta against the mark reflects in part a reversal in the flow of funds, which are now moving towards northern European currencies in search of greater returns, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The peseta has weakened against the mark after steaming through the key 84.00 per mark barrier earlier in January to around 83.35, the highest level since May last year.</p>
<p>By midday the peseta was trading at 83.78/80 per mark, after touching 83.94 earlier in the session and compared with 84.74/77 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The sudden pull-back of the peseta is linked to the weakening of the dollar/mark after its previous strong rise and a certain amount of transfer of funds toward northern European currencies in search of greater returns,&quot; said Antonio Villarroya, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Madrid.</p>
<p>But he added that the swing had not been too severe.</p>
<p>On January 10, the peseta broke through the key 84.00 per mark barrier after the Bank of Spain released its grip and refrained from intervening.</p>
<p>Traders said the central bank had been selling pesetas for some months and was keen to hold the currency in the 84.00 to 85.00 per mark band in the run-up to a single European currency.</p>
<p>Considerable flows into Spain's bond and equity markets have exerted upward pressure on the peseta.</p>
<p>But analysts were predicting a continued weakening of the currency. &quot;We continue to maintain our forecast that the peseta will return to 84.00 per mark,&quot; said Villarroya.</p>
<p>In his opinion, the peseta will trade in the coming months between 85.07 --the peseta's central parity rate in the European Monetary System-- and 83.17, a 2.25 percent fluctuation band.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the peseta could be weighed down as falls in Spanish debt yields reduce the attractiveness of Spain for overseas investors.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, one-year Treasury bill yields fell to a new low of 5.033 percent, and in coming auctions traders believe yields could slip under five percent.</p>
<p>With the spread of 10-year bonos to Bunds having narrowed to 90 basis points, investors have been moving into the short end of the yield curve, seeking value.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with the Spanish market now is the short end. The slope is very steep,&quot; said an analyst at a bank in Madrid.</p>
