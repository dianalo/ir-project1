<headline>OPTIONS - US debt volatilities choppy, await data.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatilities for U.S. debt options were mixed in choppy early afternoon trading as underlying instruments plunged from early highs, reversing a two-day rally ahead of Friday's jobs data, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;After pumping them (volatilities) up yesterday and early this morning on the follow-through strength (of the bond market), on the down move they've taken it back out,&quot; said a bond options trader at the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>December T-bond futures, after gaining some 1-1/2 points Tuesday, rose nearly another point to a high of 113-13/32 in early trade, but soon slid below Tuesday's 112-19/32 close.</p>
<p>Implied volatilities for December and March T-bond futures options were marginally down on the day at 11.8 and 10.3 percent respectively at midsession.</p>
<p>Even though volatilities normally tend to rise when bond prices fall, today's downturn was seen as a first step back to recent trading ranges, traders said. December futures had just broken above key resistance around 112-00 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There were many 1,000- to 2,000-lot deals today across the yield curve. Among the largest transactions, an investment bank was said to have bought 12,000 contracts of December 108 puts in 10-year T-notes covered against futures.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's not surprising going into Friday's numbers,&quot; a Eurodollar trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said of the market's choppiness. &quot;I think there's a little bit more uncertainty now.&quot;</p>
<p>Implied volatility for March eurodollar futures options rose slightly from Tuesday's closes to around 14.2 percent.</p>
<p>Traders positioning themselves for Friday's October U.S. employment report bid up volatilities particularly in the front months because of higher gamma implications. January volatility rose nearly a full point to about 15.2 percent.  </p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters have forecast, on average, an increase of 212,000 in October non-farm payrolls against a decline of 40,000 in September.</p>
<p>The Eurodollar trader noted that the shorter end of the market looked to be in a better shape than the longer end, citing reactions to Labor Secretary Robert Reich's remarks late in the morning that a jobless rate below five percent was possible in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;That put new lows in bonds, but we did hold (at previous session lows),&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Among the largest trades in the Eurodollar pit, a Japanese house was seen selling 5,000 contracts of June 94.00 puts.</p>
