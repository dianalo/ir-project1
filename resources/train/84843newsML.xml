<p>The Belgrade Stock Exchange (BSE) on Monday reported a slight 2.91 percent rise in its turnover for the week ending September 27 but traders said reduced liquidity was still slowing down the market.</p>
<p>The BSE weekly turnover rose to 37.93 million dinars ($7.58 million) from 36.856 in the previous week, the bourse said in its report. The number of transactions soared to 185 from 145.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall lack of funds resulting from the recently launched 10 percent reserve requirement weighs on market activity and there is no improvement in sight,&quot; a trader told Reuters.</p>
<p>One Belgrade analyst, who asked not to be named, said the central bank's measure effectively limited the money supply by forcing plenty of cash out of circulation.</p>
<p>Another market analyst said the central bank signalled it wanted only healthy banks to survive.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the bourse continues its rather slack performance with the commercial paper segment taking a lead with 157 deals worth 18.874 million dinars.</p>
<p>Interest rates on commercial paper kept their range between an annual 44 and 520 percent.</p>
<p>Central bank short-term bonds were traded five times for a volume of 15.250 million dinars.</p>
<p>Treasury bills generated 3.256 million dinars in 21 deals, the BSE's report said.</p>
<p>Earlier announcements by the government of Serbia to fund 1997 wheat sowing with a new issue of wheat selling forward contracts could give a boost to the lacklustre market, a trader said.</p>
