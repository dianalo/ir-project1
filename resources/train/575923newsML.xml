<text>
<p>Singapore gas oil was steady on Monday in quiet trading with no deals concluded as the market was firmly range bound in the absence of fresh indicators, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;No one is willing to push the market one way or the other,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Sellers offered late May lifting cargoes down to a low of $25.25 per barrel free-on-board, well above the $25.00 support level, while a bid was heard at $25.30 again about 20 cents below sellers target price for early June lifting cargoes.</p>
<p>There were no buyers for late May lifting cargoes.</p>
<p>Market attention was diverted by the unexpectedly large Indian Oil Corp (IOC) one-year term diesel award at low premiums.</p>
<p>IOC bought a total of 3.74 million tonnes for 1997-1998 delivery compared with the 1.3 million tonnes it bought for 1996-97.</p>
<p>The award price was well below previaling spot prices with two 45,000-tonne cargoes awarded at 30 cents above spot Middle East quotes to Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) on a free-on-board basis, compared to current premiums of about 60 cents.</p>
<p>It also awarded to KPC one 45,000 tonne cargo of 0.25 percent sulphur at $2.14 above MidEast quotes on a cost-and-freight basis to the west coast.</p>
<p>IOC bought one 45,000 tonne cargo each from Glencore and BB Energy at $2.04 above MidEast quotes c-and-f east coast India, and one 87,000 tonne cargo from Marubeni at 91 cents above MidEast quotes c-and-f west coast.</p>
<p>In its previous term tender, IOC bought three 45,000 tonne 0.5 percent cargoes at between $2.49-2.59 c-and-f basis to the east coast.</p>
<p>Jet fuel was also range bound with both buyers and sellers holding their prices at around the $25.00 per barrel mark.</p>
<p>India awarded one 30,000 tonne kerosene cargo for arrival to the west coast at $1.32 per barrel over spot MidEast quotes on a c-and-f basis, almost unchanged from last year.</p>
