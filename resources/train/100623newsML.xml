<p>A possible merger of the U.S. downstream operations of three of the world's largest oil companies would cut costs in a fiercely competitive oil refining and marketing industry, analyst said on Monday.</p>
<p>But they wondered just how big the cost savings a merger between Texaco, Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Star Enterprise, a joint venture between Texaco and Saudi Aramco, the state oil company of Saudi Arabia, would be.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that such a deal was under discussion and would create a $10 billion &quot;super&quot; oil company, the world's largest oil retailer, with a market share of about 15 percent in the world's biggest oil consuming nation.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the sort of thing the market should like. The question is whether it's really going to happen and what its worth,&quot; said Alan Marshall, an analyst at Robert Fleming.</p>
<p>He said the potential savings may be less than the companies hope.</p>
<p>&quot;In both Europe and the United States there is a ruthless drive to cut costs,&quot; said Peter Bogin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;But you can only cut staffing levels so far. After that you have to look at cutting back elsewhere,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A recent deal in Europe merged downstream activities of British Petroleum plc and Mobil Corp to form a $5 billion company with a 10 percent market share to compete with giants Shell and Exxon in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;That merger achieved cost savings for BP of $300 million per year,&quot; said one analyst at a Wall Street bank.</p>
<p>Robert Fleming's Marshall said the rewards of such a merger may not be as great in the United States and they were in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike with BP and Mobil where there was vast potential for cost cutting Shell Oil has already been a big turnaround story and one would have thought the scope for cost cutting would be Other analysts believe the European merger may have been triggered by a polarisation in downstream operations.</p>
<p>In Europe, the tussle for market share usually sees the major fully intergrated oil companies facing off with the smaller, nationally based organisations in France, Spain or Italy, with modest external ambitions.</p>
<p>BP sources said being a middle sized downstream company was becoming increasingly difficult in the highly competitive European market.</p>
<p>The possible United States merger would create a company with refining capacity of about 2.2 million barrels per day or over 12 percent of the national capacity.</p>
<p>The next largest are Chevron with 1.5 million bpd and then Shell and Exxon with about 1.2 million bpd each.</p>
<p>The oil industry in the West has been waiting for a response from Shell after the BP-Mobil merger in Europe was approved by the European Commision in August. Shell has been conducting an internal review of its refining in Europe after two years of industry restructuring which has done little to improve margins.</p>
<p>Last month Michael Bernard, a trading manager at Shell UK, said he did not &quot;think we are seeing any impact from the recent closures in Europe even if margins are slightly better now..they are still not covering costs.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite overcapacity in European refining, oil shares have been soaring in recent weeks due to the high price of oil which has been at its highest level since the Gulf War in 1991.</p>
<p>Shell Transport and Trading Co plc hit a record high on Monday after the merger report although a spokesman for Shell declined to comment on the report.</p>
