<title>USA: Tobacco settlement under pressure on two fronts.</title>
<headline>Tobacco settlement under pressure on two fronts.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-25</dateline>

<p>The tobacco settlement suffered its first setbacks Wednesday as public health groups rejected a key part of the historic accord and the Supreme Court rejected a separate settlement of asbestos litigation.</p>
<p>The developments came as a Senate panel was set to open hearings on Thursday on the $368.5 billion accord reached by state and industry officials last week that needs legislation by Congress to be enacted. The pact calls for cigarette makers to pay $368.5 billion over 25 years and to submit to federal regulation.</p>
<p>The public health groups said any constraints on the Food and Drug Administration's ability to regulate nicotine under the agreement was &quot;absolutely unacceptable.&quot; They also demanded that tobacco companies face &quot;severe&quot; penalties if they fail to meet goals for cutting smoking by youngsters.</p>
<p>The recommendations are not binding but are expected to carry great weight in Congress.</p>
<p>In the asbestos case, the high court upheld an appeals court ruling that threw out a $1.3 billion settlement between 20 former asbestos companies and about 100,000 people claiming injuries from the once widely used substance.</p>
<p>The court said the interests of the plaintiffs were too diverse for them to be in a class-action under federal court rules. The case had been closely watched because the ruling could have implications for the tobacco settlement.</p>
<p>While there were several differences between the asbestos case and the tobacco settlement, the Supreme Court ruling reinforced the view that the tobacco pact and other large class-action cases should be resolved through Congress, legal experts said.</p>
<p>In her majority ruling, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that Congress had not adopted a nationwide claims processing system to compensate victims of asbestos exposure.</p>
<p>That ruling could give anti-smoking lawmakers in Congress more leverage as the legislation to enact the tobacco settlement is crafted.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing that the court said cast a shadow on the authority of Congress to achieve a nationwide resolution,&quot; Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, in three points in the court's resolution, it goes out of its way to talk about how this case, the asbestos case, involves the circumstance that one confronts in the face of legislative inaction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The advisory panel of public health experts did not say whether it would try to improve the proposed settlement between the tobacco companies and the 40 states suing them or whether the pact was too weak to be salvaged.</p>
<p>But the panel objected to at least seven aspects of the plan, including the $4 billion limit on damages from lawsuits and any other obstacles to the right to sue. Limits to liability was a key industry demand in the settlement talks.</p>
<p>The health groups' unanimity was striking after a split had emerged in recent weeks. Several groups that had endorsed the general thrust of the settlement talks, including the American Heart Association, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Cancer Society, said they could not accept the FDA language in the proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;The FDA is the core of it all,&quot; Randolph Smoak, secretary-treasurer of the AMA, told Reuters. &quot;It has to be tied down so there is no wiggle room or loopholes for the industry.&quot;</p>
<p>The agreement between the cigarette companies and the state attorneys general suing them recognised FDA authority but set conditions that the health advocates argued would effectively allow the tobacco industry to fend off regulation.</p>
<p>Congressional Republican leaders have not commented on the substance of the pact and have said Congress will have to study it at length before taking action.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has set three hearings over the next month to review the agreement but not weigh specific legislation to enact it. Witnesses for the first hearing set for Thursday all took part in the settlement talks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the tobacco companies were starting to break down the initial $10.5 billion payment under the settlement.</p>
<p>Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the maker of Marlboro and the world's largest cigarette company, is expected to pay $6.5 billion of the initial payout, according to some reports.</p>
<p>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco said on Tuesday it would pay about $600 million of the initial payment.</p>
