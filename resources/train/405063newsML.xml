<p>The British Labour party's plans to reform the Bank of England and the conduct of monetary policy suggest it is highly unlikely that a Labour government would join a single European currency in 1999, economists said.</p>
<p>Labour's finance spokesman Gordon Brown said on Wednesday that he would not propose early operational independence for the central bank and that planned new institutional arrangements for monetary policy would first have to establish a track record.</p>
<p>Economists said this effectively excluded British participation in economic and monetary union (EMU) in the first wave in 1999 as the Maastricht Treaty stipulates that member states must have an independent central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;This pretty much rules out membership in the first wave,&quot; said John O'Sullivan, UK economist at NatWest Markets.</p>
<p>&quot;They would have to get onto this straight away to get the legislation through in time to have an independent central bank. They would have to have it in the Queen's Speech in November to make it in 1999.&quot;</p>
<p>Kate Barker, adviser to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and a member of the Treasury's panel of independent economic advisers, agreed with this intepretation.</p>
<p>&quot;If we were going to go into European monetary union, then an independent central bank has to be clearly established really well in advance,&quot; she told BBC radio.</p>
<p>Labour's policy on EMU &quot;still has a strong element of wait-and-see,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The opposition hopes to oust the ruling Conservatives in an election due by May 22 at the latest.</p>
<p>If Labour wins, as opinion polls suggest it will, the new government would have just weeks to prepare for a crucial summit of European Union leaders in Amsterdam in June at which they hope to agree major reforms of the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>Brown was due to deliver a key speech on monetary policy at 1800 GMT on Wednesday, setting an inflation target and spelling out reforms including the creation of a monetary policy committee at the central bank and a U.S.-style Council of Economic Advisers at the Treasury.</p>
<p>In a radio interview, Brown avoided a direct answer when asked if his eventual goal was an independent Bank of England.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't jump to transferring decision-making power until you have looked at both whether you've got the structure properly in place and whether the economic expertise is working effectively and you've got a track record,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I will look at the situation after we evaluate these two things.&quot;</p>
<p>Brian Hilliard, chief international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, said Brown's comments did not show the sense of urgency that would be needed if Labour was aiming for EMU membership in the first wave.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is a long-term aim rather than any short-term commitment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Like the Conservatives, Labour formally retains the option of joining EMU in 1999.</p>
<p>But Brown said last week that there were &quot;real hurdles&quot; which would make it increasingly difficult for Britain to join then. &quot;Getting it right is more important than getting it quickly,&quot; he said.</p>
