<p>Ireland announced a crackdown on social welfare fraud on Wednesday after official figures showed what the Irish have known for years -- lots of people who claim unemployment benefit have jobs or don't want work.</p>
<p>The government said it was extremely concerned about &quot;substantial irregularities&quot; in the unemployment support system, known as the dole, and promised to beat fraud which could cost the state up to 250 million punts ($400 million) a year.  </p>
<p>&quot;Those who are not interested in work should not expect to be carried by the majority of our citizens who are working and paying their taxes,&quot; a government statement said.</p>
<p>Social Welfare Minister Proinsias de Rossa plans to target a number of murky areas to stamp out fraudulent practices such as relatives collecting weekly dole for claimants who are unable to collect it themselves -- because they are at work.</p>
<p>De Rossa's plans include the introduction of photographs on welfare cards. He also intends to prosecute fraud vigorously.</p>
<p>The anti-fraud campaign follows publication of a survey of people claiming jobless benefits.  </p>
<p>The survey, carried out by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), found that 11 percent of those questioned said they had full-time jobs and about three-quarters of these said their job was permanent.</p>
<p>The data showed a further 10 percent said they were working part-time, 25 percent were classified as not economically active and three-quarters of these said they were neither looking for nor wanted work.  </p>
<p>&quot;The stories of the Mercedes driving up to the labour exchange or people getting off from work to actually go and collect their dole are widespread and not just in the last year or two. This has been going for years,&quot; Jim Mitchell, former chairman of parliament's public accounts committee, told Irish radio.</p>
