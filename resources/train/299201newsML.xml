<p>Police clashed with protesters in Bahrain on the first day of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan after Friday prayers and arrested a number of people, a government official said.</p>
<p>The official said worshippers gathered after the prayers at the Shi'ite Ras Roman mosque in Manama, blocked traffic and &quot;threatened the security of the people and their property&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The security forces asked the people to leave the area. When they refused, they intervened to disperse them. A number of people have been arrested,&quot; he told Reuters, but declined to give further details.</p>
<p>The Bahrain Freedom Movement, an exiled opposition group, said in a statement sent to an international news agency that police attacked worshippers after Friday prayers.</p>
<p>&quot;People started to go out of the mosque in a peaceful way...Security forces emerged from their jeeps and started firing rubber bullets and...gas that caused people to fall down,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Scores of people are reported to have been injured and arrested,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The gathering &quot;raised...demands calling for the release of detained opposition leader Sheikh Abdul-Amir al-Jamri and for the initiation of political reforms,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Jamri, a prominent Shi'ite cleric and a former member of parliament dissolved by the government in 1975, was jailed last year.</p>
<p>It was the second time in two weeks police clashed with worshippers near the Ras Roman mosque. On December 28, an official said police had dispersed people who had gathered near the mosque after Friday prayers.</p>
<p>Around 28 people have been killed in two years of sporadic unrest by members of Bahrain's majority Shi'ite Moslem community seeking political and economic reforms from the Sunni-led government.</p>
