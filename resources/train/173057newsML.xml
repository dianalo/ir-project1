<title>USA: Pena to leave as Transportation Secretary.</title>
<headline>Pena to leave as Transportation Secretary.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-11-07</dateline>

<p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena has given President Bill Clinton his resignation, department sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The department had no official comment and a spokesman said: &quot;Secretary Pena has reached no final decision about his future.&quot;</p>
<p>Pena had drawn fire for a statement made in May after the crash of a ValuJet airliner near Miami that Valujet was a safe airline. U.S. authorities later grounded ValuJet for safety shortcomings, although it has since resumed flying.</p>
<p>Department officials noted that during Pena's nearly four-year tenure he approved regulations to take the safety levels of small commuter aircraft up to those of big airliners.</p>
<p>In addition, they said, he signed 40 aviation agreements to reduce restrictions on international air travel.</p>
<p>The officials said that during Pena's time in office, U.S. investment in transportation infrastructure increased by 22 percent over the previous four-year period.</p>
