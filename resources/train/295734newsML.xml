<p>Croatian stocks continued to move up in livelier trade on Thursday, with fully-listed drugs firm Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka as sole decliners.</p>
<p>Eight out of 11 traded issues rose and one was flat.</p>
<p>But market participants predicted a steep rising trend that began in the new year would likely come to an end next week, with the market solidifying before prices start to firm again.</p>
<p>&quot;We could see a slight stagnation and stabilisation next week,&quot; said Davor Relja, analyst at Faktor brokerage.</p>
<p>He said a new upward movement could be launched soon after Croatia gets a credit rating, widely expected be solid.</p>
<p>Stocks volume rose to 10,954 shares on Thursday and turnover was also up at 7.8 from Wednesday's 5.2 million kuna.</p>
<p>Top gainer was hotelier Istraturist, jumping 38 kuna or 26.76 percent to close at 180 kuna with 637 shares sold.</p>
<p>It was followed by Zagrebacka Banka E-series, gaining 70 kuna or 14 percent to 570 kuna on volume of 592 units.</p>
<p>Bigger of the two losers, Zagrebacka's ordinary stock, fell 22 kuna to 1,208, but it was the most active issue with 5,000 units sold.</p>
<p>Its decline was in line with a weaker price of the bank's 1/10 GDRs at $22.75/85 on Seaq in the morning.</p>
<p>The other blue chip, Pliva, edged down five kuna to 415 on volume of 1,231 shares. Pliva's GDRs also eased to $15.57/74 after hitting a $16.25 record in London on Wednesday.</p>
