<p>Frankie Fredericks made a dynamic return to the track on Thursday as he ran the second fastest 100 metres ever on African soil.</p>
<p>The Namibian, who took silver in both sprints at the Atlanta Olympics, posted 9.99 seconds in the first leg of the Engen Grand Prix Summer Series.</p>
<p>Fredericks' time was 0.02 seconds slower than Briton Linford Christie's African record set in Johannesburg in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;I am extremely happy with my performance because this was my first outing since Helsinki last year,&quot; said Fredericks. &quot;My time is not important, I'm just pleased that my leg held up and that I felt comfortable out there.&quot;</p>
<p>Fredericks, who last raced in September, missed the entire indoor season due to a leg injury.</p>
<p>American Brian Lewis (10.20) and Patrick Stephens of Belgium (10.25) were second and third on Thursday.</p>
<p>There was a family double in the long jump where Susen Tiedke-Greene and husband Joe won the long jump events.</p>
<p>Susen Tiedke Greene, who returned to competition last week after a two year ban for steroid use, won the women's event with a leap of 6.71 metres.</p>
<p>Joe Tiedke Greene, like his wife a world indoor medallist, won the men's event with 8.25 metres.</p>
<p>Welshman Iwan Thomas continued where he left off last year by winning the 400 metres in a time of 44.90 seconds. Thomas was unbeaten over the distance during the last South African season.</p>
