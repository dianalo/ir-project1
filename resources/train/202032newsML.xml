<p>Record volumes of North Sea Ekofisk crude oil will flow to Teeside in northeast England next year as a new Shell pipeline pumps extra barrels into Phillips Petroleum Co's Norpipe system, industry sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 16-kilometre pipeline, which will feed 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from the Shell Expro-operated Fulmar, Gannet and Auk platforms into Norpipe from January 1997, is now complete, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;All that's left to do is to open the valves,&quot; said a trader familiar with Norpipe, which takes oil from Norway's Ekofisk field system to Phillips' terminal.</p>
<p>Shell Expro, which oversees the North Sea activities of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Exxon Corp, in May announced the constuction of the new pipeline at a cost of 75 million sterling.</p>
<p>A Phillips official at the Teeside terminal told Reuters average Norpipe throughput would jump to around 675,000 bpd in 1997 from 530,000 bpd this year, mainly due to the Shell link-up.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be the highest level in 21 years of operations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But while Ekofisk volumes are set for a boost, the quality of the North Sea crude will suffer from the addition of the new stream which has a higher sulphur content, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will raise the sulphur content very slightly - from about 0.14 percent to near 0.20 (percent),&quot; said a major Ekofisk equity producer.</p>
<p>Ekofisk, favoured by oil refiners during the summer months because of its high gasoline yield, has traditionally commanded a higher premium to benchmark Brent than rival crudes largely because of its low sulphur content.</p>
<p>While the new stream will make up less than 20 percent of total Ekofisk volumes, the addition of crudes from Fulmar and Auk, with sulphur levels of 0.26 and 0.4 percent respectively, will be enough to alter the grade's specifications.</p>
<p>Equity producers insist that regular customers like France's Total and Elf, Belgium's Petrofina, Italy's Agip and trader Louis Dreyfus, which owns a 50 percent stake in the German Wilhelmshaven refinery will notice very little impact on their operations.</p>
<p>&quot;The key thing is that they will still be able to produce one percent (sulphur) straight-run fuel oil,&quot; said an Ekofisk equity producer.</p>
<p>Refiners confirmed the higher sulphur will have little impact on their output. Most importantly, heavy fuel oil will still have a sulphur content of less than one percent enabling sales into the lucrative Italian market</p>
<p>But Phillips' refinery on Teeside, which traders said runs on a pure diet of Ekofisk, may struggle to keep its semi-finished fuel below the 0.5 percent maximum sulphur content required for Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Producers said they expect Ekofisk will be unable to command a stronger Brent-related premium than its historically cheaper rival, British Forties crude.</p>
<p>Norpipe volumes could receive a second boost later in the year if a legal dispute between Phillips and Enron over the start-up date for J-Block can be resolved.</p>
<p>Phillips has applied to the House of Lords for leave to appeal against a ruling which allows Enron to refuse to agree to an early commissioning.</p>
<p>Enron, which has a long-term &quot;take or pay contact&quot; to buy natural gas from J-Block, is seeking a delay because of the slump in gas prices on the British spot market.</p>
<p>Production could begin in the second quarter of 1997, a Phillips official said.</p>
