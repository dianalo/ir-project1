<headline>F.O. LICHT - Daily sugar report.</headline>

<p>The following is a direct contribution from statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920.</p>
<p>SUGAR: World market for October 1, 1996</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London closed lower in quiet dealings. December lost $2.10 to close at $322.50, while March shed $2.80 to close at $318.30.</p>
<p>In New York, world raw sugar futures ended weaker on speculative selling and the market was not able to hold the sharp gains made Monday. The steady flow of sugar from Brazil is likely to keep prices under pressure.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>EUROPE - Most of the European sugar beet areas only saw light rains during the week ended October 1. Rains were not heavy enough in most areas to interfer with harvesting operations. Soils are still too wet in Eastern Europe and harvest progress will remain behind normal. The western areas will continue to make normal harvest progress.</p>
<p>The delay in harvesting operations in Eastern Europe could affect yields. In the former Soviet Union, sugar beet areas continued to receive abundant rain. Rain receipts for the month ended up at 250 to 500 per cent of normal. Soils are saturated and harvesting was extremely difficult. Normally, nearly half of the crop is harvested by the beginning of October, but very little has been accomplished this season. The late harvest increases the danger of frost damage.</p>
<p>NEW ZEALAND - Sugar imports in August 1996 amounted to 282 tonnes, which brought cumulative imports in the first eight months of 1996 (January/August) up to 151,336 tonnes, up on last year's 133,370 tonnes. Total imports in 1995 amounted to 210,379 tonnes compared to 215,117 tonnes in 1994.</p>
<p>The major country of origin in January/August 1996 was Australia with 94,256 tonnes raws against 118,041 tonnes and 52,126 tonnes whites compared to 13,007 tonnes.</p>
<p>Sugar exports in August 1996 amounted to 2,250 tonnes, down from 4,459 tonnes exported in August 1995. This brought cumulative exports in January/August 1996 up to 12,848 tonnes against 15,587 tonnes in January/August 1995. Total exports in 1995 reached 20,270 tonnes against 16,007 tonnes in 1994.</p>
<p>The major country of destination in January/August 1996 was French Polynesia with 3,843 tonnes whites against 3,890 tonnes in the like period the previous year.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - Sugar production in July 1996 amounted to 107,957 tonnes, raw value, down from last year's 171,733 tonnes. This brought cumulative production in the first ten months of 1995/96 (October/July) up to 6.27 million tonnes, 6.5 per cent down on the 6.70 million tonnes produced in the like period the previous year. Total production in 1994/95 amounted to 7.16 million tonnes against 6.92 million tonnes in 1993/94.</p>
<p>Sugar consumption in July 1996 amounted to 734,832 tonnes, up on last year's 689,494 tonnes. This brought cumulative consumption in October/July 1995/96 up to 7.00 million tonnes, more than 4 per cent up on last year's 6.73 million tonnes. Total consumption in 1994/95 amounted to 8.35 million tonnes, slightly down on the previous year's 8.36 million tonnes.</p>
<p>TENDERS</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has opened a tender for 12,500 tonnes of white sugar for delivery in Colombo in the first half of September.</p>
