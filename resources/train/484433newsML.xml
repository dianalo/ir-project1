<p>Thai stocks closed 1.48 percent lower in moderate trade on Thursday as investors sold large capitalised banking and finance issues and took profits after yesterday's rally, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite SET index retreated 10.63 points to 706.01 on 4.1 billion baht turnover. The SET-50 index declined 0.89 point to 52.68.</p>
<p>&quot;The market fundamentals remained unchanged today as investors continued to worry about the first quarter corporate earnings and on asset quality of financial institutions,&quot; said Payuha Boonsiri of Nithipat Capital.  </p>
<p>Decliners trounced gainers 225 to 84 while 76 issues remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were concerned that first quarter corporate earnings results due to be released next month would not be impressive.</p>
<p>They said local investors were active in the market on Thursday while foreigners withdrew after Wednesday's buying.</p>
<p>All the key sectors dropped on Thursday. The energy sector fell most, retreating 3.67 percent, followed by the communication sector declining 2 percent. The finance sector shed 1.92 percent and the banking sector dipped 1.12 percent.  </p>
<p>Large capitalised Bangkok Bank topped the active list, unchanged at 187 baht. Thai Military Bank, which was briefly halted from trading by the SET earlier in the afternoon, shed two to 37.</p>
<p>Thai Military Bank shares were halted from trading after its subsidiaries Nava Finance and Thaimex Finance announced they had merged with CMIC Finance.</p>
<p>At the time when they were halted, Nava Finance gained 0.25 to 23.75, Thaimex Finance lost 0.75 to 22 and CMIC Finance rose 0.50 to 16.25. -- Suthep Chawla (662) 652-0642</p>
