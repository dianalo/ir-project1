<headline>U.N. dismisses German report on Iraqi air strike.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.N. officials and knowledgable diplomats on Tuesday dismissed a German newspaper report that the United States was contemplating a strike against Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to have significant problems in all the areas-- including the missile area,&quot; said Charles Duelfer, the American deputy director of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe they may have an operational missile force. but there is nothing we have discovered recently that would provoke this (news) report,&quot; he said, referring to an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.</p>
<p>Rolf Ekeus, director of the commission, is currently in Bonn before going to Moscow later this week.</p>
<p>Envoys from the United States and Western European missions, who follow developments closely, said they were baffled by the reports from Germany.</p>
<p>But diplomats said that there was evidence, as the paper reported, showing  that Iraqi engineers had worked on a secret long-range missile program between July and September 1992.</p>
<p>They said there was no direct proof that the work had still been going on recently, but said it was however &quot;highly probable.&quot;</p>
