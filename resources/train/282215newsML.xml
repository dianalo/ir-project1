<headline>U.S. spot heat up with NYMEX, gasoline diffs ease.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. spot No. 2 oil prices surged higher by the end of trading Tuesday as the NYMEX futures shot higher.</p>
<p>But U.S. Gulf (USG) spot unleaded gasoline differentials fell sharply, offsetting the late jump in the futures market, traders said. Traders attributed the NYMEX rally to squeeze of short positions as the January product contracts reached expiration at the close.</p>
<p>Cash market trade wound down near midday Tuesday as the NYMEX shut at 1300 EST (1800 GMT). The Exchange will be closed Wednesday for the New Year's Day holiday.</p>
<p>USG conventional unleaded M4 gasoline for delivery in the 1st cycle on the Colonial Pipeline changed hands at 3.50 cents under the February print, down about 1.5 cents from Monday.</p>
<p>However, activity remained thin and volatile with ample amount of gasoline available, market players said.</p>
<p>USG reformulated A4 unleaded gasoline also slid lower, with offers for the first cycle reported at about 1.0 cent under the screen, down about 1.5 cents on the day.</p>
<p>USG and New York Harbor No. 2 oil diffs showed very little movement, traders said, with few barrels trading on Tuesday.</p>
