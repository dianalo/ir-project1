<p>The Israeli shekel representative rate was fixed almost unchanged against the dollar and the basket of key foreign currencies on Tuesday in quiet trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Activity was relatively low today and the shekel in early trading rose against the dollar following the rise of the mark against the U.S. currency,&quot; said a dealer at Israel Discount Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again the Bank of Israel had to intervene in the market buying dollars to support the basket. Because of the low activity, the central bank had to buy only $70 million. Following the bank's intervention the dollar rose, closing almost unchanged,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The central bank has been intervening regularly in the market to defend the currency basket rate, which has been trading at the bottom end of its band for two months.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3670 shekels against 3.3660 on Monday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, was fixed at 3.6536 shekels against 3.6529 on Monday.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the shekel traded against the yen at 2.7405 shekels per 100 yen compared with 2.7244 on Monday, and against the mark at 1.9967 shekels after 1.9970 on Monday.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, the dollar was trading at 3.3645 shekels.</p>
