<p>Placer Dome Inc said on Thursday it now held more than 50 percent of takeover target Highlands Gold Ltd.</p>
<p>The A$0.75 a share offer is due to close on January 18.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased with the level of acceptances we have received to date and are looking forward to closing our offer on Saturday,&quot; Placer Dome chief executive John Willson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Highlands' board had urged shareholders to reject the offer, saying the company was worth significantly more than Placer's bid.  </p>
<p>Placer had amassed a 33.3 percent stake in Highlands, which has 25 percent of the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, before launching its bid in November.</p>
<p>Placer currently holds a 25 percent stake in Porgera through its listed Placer Pacific Ltd unit, for which it has also launched a takeover bid.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Highlands said talks with potential underwriters of a Highlands restructuring were continuing but said it was unlikely that a proposal would be completed before the closing of Placer Dome's offer.  </p>
<p>Directors of Highlands said they continued to recommend that shareholders reject Placer's offer as it undervalued Highlands and a restructuring would be in the best interests of all shareholders.</p>
<p>Highlands said Placer's indicated objective was to acquire all of Highland's interest in Porgera, and in the event that it did not compulsorily acquire all outstanding shares, a further proposal may be presented to Highlands shareholders.</p>
