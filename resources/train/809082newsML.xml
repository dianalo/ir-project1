<p>A major sell-off in blue chips on Tuesday dragged Indian stock markets lower with the Bombay index posting its biggest fall in nearly five months, traders said.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange re-opened after a four day weekend, which mitigated the scale of Tuesday's decline.</p>
<p>The National Stock Exchange, which was open had fallen more than two percent on Monday, and today's fall on the BSE was largely to catch up.</p>
<p>The Bombay index shed 155.35 points, or 3.60 percent to close at 4,165.37.  </p>
<p>The Bombay index fall was the biggest after a nearly 300 point, eight percent, tumble in March this year.</p>
<p>Investors should see falling prices as an opportunity to buy, Caspian Research India Pvt Ltd said. &quot;The volatility of the next four to five months should be viewed as opportunity to accumulate stock,&quot; the securities firm said in its latest report.</p>
<p>The fall in share prices is a logical correction after the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange index had soared 60 percent from a three-year low reached in December 1996, it said.</p>
