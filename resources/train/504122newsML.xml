<p>Australia's largest motoring organisation, the Sydney-based NRMA, said on Friday it was considering a plan to operate its own &quot;superstore&quot; used car yards which would remove haggling over prices and trade-ins.</p>
<p>&quot;It is wrong to suggest that this is an attack on car dealers,&quot; NRMA (National Roads and Motorists Association) chief executive Malcolm Jones said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers are already voting with their feet and over 50 percent of used car buyers currently choose to buy privately rather than from a dealer. These are the people we are looking at providing assistance to,&quot; Jones said.  </p>
<p>NRMA, which provides roadside assistance services to stranded motorists as well as purchasing advice, said the superstore proposal was at the feasibility stage and the board was yet to make a final decision.</p>
<p>NRMA is also a major general insurance operation.</p>
<p>&quot;NRMA is examining the feasibility of helping members to buy cars at a value for money price,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>&quot;A Superstore is a new trend emerging in the USA for buying vehicles as is using the Internet.&quot;  </p>
<p>The proposal was strongly criticised by second hand car dealers quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, with one prominent dealer saying it would put 600 used car yards out of business.</p>
<p>NRMA said a superstore would have touch-screen guides to buying a car, which would not be more than five years old, fixed prices with no bargaining, a fixed trade-in price and a return policy for unhappy customers.</p>
