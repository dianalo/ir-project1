<p>European consortium Airbus Industrie hopes to seize on China's need for planes to meet a rapid expansion of domestic airways and sell up to 75 airliners to China next month, industry officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The deal could be signed during a visit to Beijing in May by French President Jacques Chirac, said one Western industry official who declined to be further identified.</p>
<p>Airbus Industrie hoped to conclude an agreement to sell as many as 75 airliners to China, with an option on a further 25, during Chirac's visit, the official said.</p>
<p>Airbus had proposed a package of aircraft for sale to the Civil Aviation General Administration of China, a company spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;What can I say? We haven't signed the deal yet,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>A Chinese aviation official said a deal was expected during Chirac's visit but declined to specify how many aircraft Beijing might decide to purchase or which of China's domestic and international airlines would buy and use the planes. Four domestic Chinese airlines currently use Airbus airliners.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what Airbus is hoping for,&quot; the official said when asked if the deal would be for 75 aircraft.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a hope that the deal will be for this number,&quot; said the Western industry official, adding that it was up to China to decide how many of the aircraft it wanted.</p>
<p>He said Airbus saw a real possibility of winning a huge order during Chirac's visit because China needed to buy as many as 150 planes by the turn of the century to keep up with demand in its rapidly growing aviation market.</p>
<p>&quot;They need these planes and they will want to put in their orders rapidly,&quot; said the industry official who declined to be further identified.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very saturated by other orders and they have to position themselves in the assembly lines,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China was interested in narrow-bodied, short-haul aircraft from Airbus, particularly its A320 family of airliners with most purchases expected to be A319s, A320s and A321s, which carry a price tag of about $40 million each, officials said.</p>
<p>However, China's order could include up to 10 of Airbus Industrie's larger A340 airliners, which cost about $120-130 million each, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We really like the advanced cockpit controls of the Airbus,&quot; the Chinese official said. Some pilots have criticised the highly computerised Airbus cockpit.</p>
<p>&quot;The Airbus design is more modern than Boeing's,&quot; the Chinese official said.</p>
<p>However, he said he did not expect Airbus to displace Boeing Co in China, where the U.S. giant accounts for about 75 percent of foreign airliners in use.</p>
<p>One regional airline official said he thought the purchase from Airbus might fall short of the consortium's hopes.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will not be as many as 75,&quot; he said. &quot;We are used to using Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft.&quot;</p>
<p>China bought 30 airliners from Airbus in April last year in a $1.5 billion deal signed during a visit to France by Premier Li Peng.</p>
<p>Boeing signed a $685 million deal to sell five 777-200 jets to China during a visit by Vice President Al Gore last month.</p>
<p>Airbus has said it hopes to win a 50 percent market penetration in China over the next 20 years, with China expected to place orders for 1,000 passenger jets over that period.</p>
<p>Politics has played a role in China's orders, with Boeing hinting it lost out to Airbus last year when Sino-U.S. ties chilled in 1995 and early 1996.</p>
<p>Chinese ties with France are blossoming, with a French decision not to back a motion to censure China over human rights at the United Nations in Geneva this month almost certain to boost ties further.</p>
