<p>The rapid installation of a credible legislature was crucial to retain confidence in Hong Kong's administration after its handover to China, a senior official of the current and future governments said on Monday.</p>
<p>But a leader of the violently-supressed 1989 democracy movement in Beijing said she feared for the future of freedom in Hong Kong once China retakes the British colony on July 1.</p>
<p>Underlining the impending flag change, a second advance guard of 66 troops from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) arrived on Monday to get future garrison facilities ready.</p>
<p>In 43 days, Hong Kong, a capitalist territory of 6.4 million people, reverts to China after 156 years as a British colony.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chief Secretary Anson Chan said one of the top priorities of the post-July administration was to install a successor to the current legislature, which will cease to exist after Britain hands the territory back to China.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an obligation to the community to ensure that they are represented by a credible and authoritative legislature in which they, and the international community have confidence,&quot; Chan said in a speech to business conference in Manila.</p>
<p>&quot;Otherwise, the credibility and authority of the future administration itself will be weakened,&quot; she warned.</p>
<p>Chan, who will remain the territory's top civil servant beyond the handover, did not specifically mention the provisional legislature, which will replace the current council on July 1.</p>
<p>The provisional body was chosen by a China-backed committee of 400 last year. The current, elected council will be scrapped because Beijing says electoral rules used in the 1995 polls violated previous Sino-British agreements.</p>
<p>The provisional legislature is expected to be only an interim law-making body to ensure a smooth transition of power in the early days of the handover and will be replaced by some form of elected body in 1998.</p>
<p>Chan noted opinion polls showed that, despite confidence in Hong Kong's economic prospects, many people were less certain about freedoms and civil liberties.</p>
<p>An opinion poll published by the South China Morning Post newspaper on Monday showed Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa has suffered a dip in popularity over plans to curb civil rights. Some 41.7 percent of respondents also said they now had less trust in Tung, a former shipping tycoon.</p>
<p>Last month Tung unveiled plans to curb protests and ban foreign funding for political groups in Hong Kong after July 1.</p>
<p>But in a separate poll by Reuters, big Hong Kong companies remained positive about the post-handover business outlook.</p>
<p>Chinese pro-democracy dissident Chai Ling on Monday voiced concern about the future of freedoms in Hong Kong and urged the PLA not to repeat the 1989 massacre of protesters in Beijing.</p>
<p>Chai, one of the leaders of the protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, was in Hong Kong for a short, private visit.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very concerned about how much freedom the people in Hong Kong will be allowed to have after July 1,&quot; Chai told a news conference. Hong Kong people would have to defend their freedom and liberty inch by inch, she said.</p>
<p>A 66-strong unit of unarmed PLA soldiers drove into Hong Kong on Monday, the second contingent in as many months to arrive.</p>
<p>Forty PLA soldiers came in April to prepare logistics and camp facilities before the eventual arrival on July 1 of the rest of PLA troops to be stationed in the territory.</p>
<p>Major-General Liu Zhenwu, commander of the future Hong Kong garrison, urged the unit &quot;to carry on the fine traditions of the PLA, and to perform the sacred duties entrusted to them by the country and people&quot;, official Chinese media reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new direct train service from the territory to the Chinese capital was launched on Monday, bringing Hong Kong and Beijing ever closer.</p>
<p>&quot;It symbolises...the strengthening ties between Hong Kong and China, which so many people have been longing for,&quot; Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told guests and passengers at the territory's Hung Hom Railway Station.</p>
