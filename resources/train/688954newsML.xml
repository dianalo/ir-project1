<headline>Ecuador's Alarcon denies row with economic team.</headline>
<dateline>QUITO 1997-06-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ecuadorean President Fabian Alarcon on Thursday rejected media reports of differences with his economic team on the direction of economic policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The news that I have is that there is no controversy with the economic team,&quot; Alarcon told reporters. &quot;There is no difference of opinions, or at least they have not mentioned any.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspaper reports said all three members of the economic team submitted their resignations over differences in policy.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Carlos Davalos said earlier Thursday he had offered his resignation to the president but that Alarcon had not decided yet whether to accept it.</p>
<p>But an aide to Ecuador's central bank general manager,  Fidel Jaramillo, said his boss had not offered to quit.</p>
<p>&quot;The manager has not presented his resignation. He remains in his post,&quot; the aide, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Since a referendum at the end of May approved of Alarcon's mandate after the ousting of former President Abdala Bucaram earlier in the year, several members of the government have offered their resignations as a goodwill gesture to give Alarcon a free hand in chosing ministers.</p>
<p>Davalos, Jaramillo and Monetary Board President Danilo Carrera have left for Washington to meet with International Monetary Fund officials.</p>
