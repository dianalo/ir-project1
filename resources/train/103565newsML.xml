<p>The rapid growth of cities around the world has put millions more people at risk from an increasing number of floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters, a United Nations expert said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Dr Olavi Elo, speaking on the eve of the annual World Disaster Reduction Day, said the danger could be greatly diminshed through education, especially in developing countries, and strict observance of construction and zoning rules.</p>
<p>&quot;Already, at least one quarter of the people on earth live in high-risk areas and their number is growing rapidly,&quot; the Finnish Director of the secretariat of the UN's International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction said.</p>
<p>By the turn of the century, around one half of the global population would be living in urban centres, the vast majority of them in poorer countries which were most vulnerable, he told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The high density of population in slums and squatter settlements in developing world cities, the use of hazardous ground such as unstable slopes, reclaimed land, ravines and river banks, the concentration of poorly-constructed and badly maintained buildings, are a recipe for urban disaster,&quot; the Finnish specialist said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every year building codes are ignored and zoning regulations overlooked as communities continue to expand into areas prone to every kind of natural disaster,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>This year's Day, to be marked around the globe on Wednesday, focuses on &quot;Cities at Risk&quot;. The Decade was launched in 1990, reflecting concern among governments at the mounting economic cost of natural disasters.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), under whose wing the 10-year campaign to mitigate the effects of disasters is being waged, says the number of people affected has been increasing six per cent annually since 1960.</p>
<p>&quot;The disasters are getting much worse too,&quot; Elo said. &quot;Before 1987, there was only one that cost insurance companies $1 billion.&quot;</p>
<p>Since then, he added, there had been at least 15, including last year's Kobe earthquake in Japan, which killed some 6,300 people and cost around $100 billion.</p>
<p>In 1995, Elo said, there were 28 disasters officially classified by the U.N. as &quot;complex emergencies&quot; and overall the 213 major natural disasters recorded during the year cost at least $150 billion -- nearly three times more than in 1994.</p>
<p>By the year 2000, there would be more than 100 cities with populations of more than two million, and of these half would be within 150 miles (241.4 km) of the boundaries of tectonic plates whose movement below the earth's surface causes quakes.</p>
<p>But the most frequent disaster nowadays was flooding, often the outcome of rapid urbanisation. &quot;Flash floods are caused by the compacted earth and concrete in cities because they absorb little water,&quot; the U.N. expert said.</p>
<p>&quot;What is needed is a change in people's attitudes towards disasters,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no longer any reason to be fatalistic about them. Many, like flash floods and landslides, are our own fault and can be eliminated.&quot;</p>
<p>In disasters like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or hurricanes which could not be avoided, loss of life and destruction could be minimised through use of warning systems and by involving communities in preparing for them.</p>
