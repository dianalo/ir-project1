<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to concentrate on trade and economic relations during his official visit to Indonesia.</p>
<p>But German officials have indicated human rights and the thorny problem of East Timor could also come up in discussions on Monday with Indonesia's President Suharto and other government leaders.</p>
<p>Kohl, accompanied by three federal ministers and 56 German industrialists, arrived in Jakarta on Saturday and was due to spend a leisurely Sunday with Suharto among the Thousand Islands in the Java Sea north of Jakarta.</p>
<p>Accompanying them was Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Habibie, a close associate of Suharto who has retained close links with Germany, having studied there at the Technical University of Aachen.</p>
<p>Fritz Kleinsteuber, director of the Indonesian-German Economic Association in Jakarta, told Reuters there were good opportunities for German businesses in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Indonesia needs to develop small and medium-sized industries in layers below the established conglomerates, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to promote German companies moving into Asia. For me, China is number one in Asia. But China is not the place for medium- and small-sized industries.</p>
<p>&quot;Indonesia is the place. There is no doubt they are coming,&quot; Kleinsteuber said.</p>
<p>Germany is Indonesia's largest European market. Two-way trade amounted to 6.8 billion marks ($4.46 billion) in 1995, 75 percent higher than five years before.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not need to improve our relationship. Our relationship is excellent,&quot; Kleinsteuber said.</p>
<p>Kohl has called Suharto, who underwent medical checks near Frankfurt earlier this year, a &quot;good friend of Germany&quot;.</p>
<p>But a German government official said last week Kohl would raise the issue of human rights during his visit.</p>
<p>Self-exiled East Timorese resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta, who was awarded the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with East Timorese Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, urged Kohl on Friday to press Suharto to begin withdrawing troops from East Timor.</p>
<p>Indonesian troops occupied the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it the following year, a move the United Nations has refused to recognise.</p>
<p>Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres has also appealed to Kohl to raise what Guterres called &quot;intolerable conditions&quot; in East Timor.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta, who lives in Sydney, Australia, has said no country in Europe had more influence on Indonesia than Germany.</p>
<p>Suharto's official visit to Germany in 1995 was marked by demonstrations by human rights groups who accused Indonesia of sacrificing human rights and the environment for economic growth -- currently running at around eight percent per year.</p>
<p>Kleinsteuber said German public opinion toward Indonesia was positive but perceptions had changed since the Nobel Prize award.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;I am buoyant, of course, because I know Indonesia will be able to master the difficulty and trust will return.&quot;</p>
<p>Kleinsteuber said German business had missed the initial opportunity to take advantage of Asia's fast-growing economies.</p>
<p>&quot;Somehow, they missed the first train, but they now are catching the next one,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kohl will leave for the Philippines on Tuesday morning and then go on to Japan.</p>
