<headline>GOLF-NICHOLAS HOLDS LEAD AFTER THIRD ROUND OF U.S. WOMEN'S OPEN.</headline>

<p>England's Alison Nicholas moved within sight of a huge surprise victory when she extended her lead to three strokes after the third round at the U.S. Women's Open Saturday.</p>
<p>Nicholas, who started the day with a one-stroke advantage, made only one bogey in a four-under-par 67 in pleasant conditions on the Pumpkin Ridge course.</p>
<p>She posted a championship record low three-round total of 10-under 203, while veteran American Nancy Lopez (69) was second on 206.</p>
<p>Another Englishwoman, Lisa Hackney (67), trailed by five strokes, while American Kim Williams (67) birdied the final two holes to move within six shots.</p>
<p>Australian Karrie Webb made the day's biggest move with a 65, the lowest round of the tournament, but she still faced a seven-shot deficit.</p>
<p>Nicholas, who at five feet (150 centimetres) is the shortest player in the field, is only 68th on this year's LPGA money list, and until this week she had only recorded two rounds in the 60s.</p>
<p>However, the 1987 Women's British Open champion found some confidence during three tournaments in Europe recently, and she brought it back across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>&quot;I played really well today,&quot; said Nicholas, 35, a four-time European Solheim Cup member. &quot;I'm absolutely delighted. I tried to hit fairways and greens and obviously I made a few putts as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicholas has two LPGA victories, both in 1995, one of them in nearby Portland.</p>
<p>Lopez, meanwhile, received overwhelming support from the big galleries, and she did not let down her thousands of fans as she moved into a challenging position.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't been this close in a long time to win the U.S. Open,&quot; said Lopez, who has won 48 LPGA tournaments.</p>
<p>However, she has not won the U.S. Open, the biggest championship in women's golf, and at age 40 she probably won't get too many more chances.</p>
<p>&quot;I really don't feel any pressure,&quot; said Lopez, three times a U.S. Open runner-up. &quot;I look forward to tomorrow. I don't dread it, don't fear it. I feel pretty pumped up.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopez and Nicholas clashed in the final day singles at the 1992 Solheim Cup, and Lopez won emphatically 6 and 4.</p>
<p>However, two days earlier, Nicholas teamed with Laura Davies to beat Lopez and Pat Bradley 2 and 1 in a foursomes match.</p>
