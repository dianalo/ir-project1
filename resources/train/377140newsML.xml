<p>Thai rice exporters hoped the government would be able to secure more rice orders from Manila to rejuvenate the currently dull market, trade sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Prices on the generally lacklustre market have remained lacklustre this week.</p>
<p>Some traders said they expected the govenment to secure another 100,000 tonnes of purchases from the Philippines on top of 205,000 tonnes already committed for March/April and May/June shipments.</p>
<p>The Philippines National Food Authority (NFA) announced that it was seeking to import up to 650,000 tonnes of rice before the end of the third quarter this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Vietnam and Pakistan will offer attractive prices, no doubt. But I still believe we should be able to compete and get more orders,&quot; said one exporter.</p>
<p>The price of Thai benchmark 100 percent B grade was unchanged at $370-390 per tonne FOB Bangkok while 100 percent fragrant was quoted at $620-630 per tonne on the same basis.</p>
<p>&quot;Although demand was slow, prices barely dropped as the amount of supplies entering the market was low as well,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Parboiled rice prices edged up on contracts covering for Nigeria, the sources said.</p>
<p>At ports, 14 vessels were loading rice to Asian and African destinations. Thailand's rice exports so far this year have dropped sharply from the corresponding period in 1996.</p>
<p>Rice exports during January 1-February 12 were recorded at 476,307 tonnes compared with 739,612 tonnes in the same period last year.</p>
