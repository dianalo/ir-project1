<p>Sterling hit the high spots on Friday against the mark and the dollar in active European trade amid positive market reaction to what looks to be new-found unity in the ruling Conservative party.</p>
<p>But analysts warned that sterling's strength may dissipate as quickly as the euphoria of the party faithful at the annual Conservative conference in Bournemouth, which ended on Friday with a keynote speech from Prime Minister John Major.</p>
<p>&quot;The big unanswered question is whether this new-found unity will last past the weekend. There are a lot of issues that haven't gone away,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy.</p>
<p>The pound started its upward surge early on Friday in a move which dealers said was the result of an unexpectedly strong conference performance on Thursday by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't take much of a trigger (to improve sterling sentiment),&quot; said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>Sterling broke through 2.40 marks in early business and pushed on to a high of 2.4110 before easing back to 2.4095 at 1200GMT. This compares with 2.3943 late Thursday in Europe.</p>
<p>The pound also rose strongly against the dollar, trading at 1210 GMT at $1.5761, near its session high, compared with $1.5654 late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gerry Celaya, senior technical analyst at American Express Bank, said the break of 2.4020 marks was very important for the bullish sterling scenario and the pound should now target the 2.4120 range and further to 2.42.</p>
<p>Clarke's speech, the main points of which were repeated and driven home in Major's address, pledged a 20 percent base tax rate for all when it was affordable and the abolition of capital gains and inheritance taxes.</p>
<p>Both speeches papered over months of squabbling over European economic and monetary union (EMU) which had until now made Conservative victory in another general election a bad bet.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the show of conference unity and its positive knock-on effect on sterling would find it difficult to stand the test of time.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a full set of potentially bad news along the line, so I think any kind of projection for strong sterling emergence is jumping the gun,&quot; said David Brown, economist at Bear Sterns.</p>
<p>Newspapers hailed Clarke's speech as a triumph, and the Times said it was a &quot;barnstorming&quot; performance which vanquished his Euro-sceptic foes to the right of the party.</p>
<p>Dealers said an article in Friday's Times predicting a rise in sterling also helped boost sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;The article in The Times seems to have given Far Eastern players a chance to push sterling/mark up a quick 30 to 40 points,&quot; said a UK bank dealer.</p>
<p>The article said the winner of next year's election, at the moment heavily tipped by pollsters to be the the opposition Labour Party, would be dogged with a strong currency which would be a major headache for exporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The market overemphasised the (Times) article but it highlights that sterling sentiment is favourable,&quot; said Lyons.</p>
<p>Dealers said the pound was further supported by the view that it had been undervalued in recent months.</p>
<p>Moreover, sterling is being dragged up in line with EMU convergance trades amid speculation that the lira, markka and possibly the Swedish crown were preparing to join the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).</p>
<p>On top of this, the pound is seen as being a safe-haven from any European turmoil that might result if the process of monetary union begins to crumble because most traders do not believe that Britain will be in the first EMU group in 1999.</p>
