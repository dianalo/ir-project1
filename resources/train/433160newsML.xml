<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - Moderate December quarter GDP data, and a downward revision to the September quarter, raised some doubts over the government's budget forecast of 3.5 percent for 1996/97 on a year average basis.  </p>
<p>The median forecast of economists is for year average growth of 3.0 percent, and they said the lower growth result may have some impact on the budget bottom line.</p>
<p>With unemployment still seen fairly high by mid year, tax receipts should be lower than expected and welfare payments will probably be higher than expected.</p>
<p>While the government stood by its 1996/97 forecast this week, economists said that as the 1997/98 budget is due in May, the government may still revise the growth forecast before year end.  </p>
<p>Against the expectations of lower growth in the current financial year, economists see growth in 1997/98 economists as being stronger than expected</p>

<p>LABOUR FORCE - Some moderate growth, although once again not enought to make any inroads into unemployment, is expected in January. With revised data showing the pace of growth slightly slower than originally reported last week, economists said employment should post its fifth consecutive rise, in line with expectations of a strengthening economy. One of the most watched indicators in the second half of the year, the expectation of the labour force statistics has lessened given the less likelihood of another rate cut in the past month. However, economists did say that after the growth of the December quarter the risks to employment growth are probably to the downside.  </p>
<p>HOUSING FINANCE - A rise in line with median expectations would take housing finance back to levels last seen around August 1994. Economists said they were looking for a continuation of the recent trend away from refinancing and into new construction as the housing sector starts to recover from its two year slump. The preconditions for sustained recovery from the slump since mid-1994 have been set in place, and economists are now looking for a run of positive housing finance numbers as the housing upswing gathers pace.  </p>
