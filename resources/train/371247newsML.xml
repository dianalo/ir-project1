<p>An animal rights group released video tape on Monday showing what it called inhumane and unacceptable killings in Canada's annual seal hunt.</p>
<p>Members of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), posing as fishers, filmed the video last year and claimed they saw such incidents as skinning seals alive, using hooks to catch live seals and leaving injured animals to die.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm deeply troubled by the evidence I've seen and by the behavior of elected officials who are promoting a hunt which they clearly cannot control,&quot; lawyer Clayton Ruby, who reviewed the film on behalf of IFAW, told a news conference.</p>
<p>The group said the video showed 144 incidents that violated seal hunt regulations and 34 other examples of abuse and problems in the industry.</p>
<p>The government says that in 1996, Canada's 10,000 sealers caught 242,000 seals, more than quadrupling the 53,000 taken in 1995.</p>
<p>The federal Department of Fisheries -- which encourages the seal hunt as a means of conserving depleted cod stocks that seals eat in vast amounts -- defended its monitoring efforts and pointed out that it had laid 114 charges in 1996.</p>
<p>It said 100 fisheries officers in the region monitor the hunt on the ice, on ships and in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;We have monitored and we have found violations, although rare, and we have laid charges,&quot; said David Bevan, head of the conservation and enforcement branch.</p>
<p>&quot;I think these things are going to happen. We obtain information from a number of sources. It's not just IFAW that have provided us with information that's led to convictions,&quot; Bevan told Reuters.</p>
<p>An amateur video of the seal hunt released by IFAW last February resulted in convictions against four sealers for illegal sealing practices.</p>
<p>Bevan said Fisheries investigators and scientists would review the latest video to see if the actions on the tape were illegal.</p>
<p>Sealers defended the hunt. &quot;To the uninitiated, sure it (the video) looks gruesome. It's not pretty but from what I saw, a lot of it was the normal business of sealing&quot;, said Tina Fagan, executive director of the Canadian Sealing Association.</p>
<p>&quot;Killing is never pretty and it's never pretty anywhere whether its out on the white ice floes with red blood flowing or whether it's in an abattoir.&quot;</p>
