<p>Sri Lankan troops clashed with separatist Tamil rebels in the northern Jaffna peninsula on Saturday, and four soldiers were killed and one was wounded, the military said.</p>
<p>The fighting occurred when Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels tried to infiltrate army defences at Udippili in the Tenmardchi division of Jaffna in the early morning, a military official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Troops retaliated and the rebels withdrew. Our troops confirmed heavy casualties among the rebels,&quot; he said, without giving any figure.</p>
<p>The rebels were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The clash came one day after the LTTE accused the government of President Chandrika Kumartunga of human rights violations in Jaffna, including the arrest and disappearance of minority Tamil youths under the guise of cracking down on inflitrators.</p>
<p>Jaffna had been ruled for almost a decade by the rebels, who are fighting for an independent Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east. It was captured by the army in April.</p>
<p>&quot;The whereabouts of many arrested people remain a mystery. The military always denies such arrests,&quot; said a statement issued by the LTTE's London office.</p>
<p>&quot;The parents feel that this denial means either their children have been killed already or they will be killed in the future by the army,&quot; it charged.</p>
<p>The military says the rebels continue to infilitrate Jaffna and attack government targets there. In July, a rebel suicide bomber exploded a device in Jaffna town, killing 21 people and wounding a government minister.</p>
<p>Deputy Defence Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told reporters on Friday that some rebel infiltrators had been arrested, and that they were being investigated and would be tried according to the law.</p>
<p>Ratwatte said the arrests had been documented, and those arrested have been produced in court.</p>
<p>Jaffna is off-limits to journalists, and no independent verification is possible.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the ethnic conflict since it began in 1983.</p>
