<p>Builders broke ground on new homes and apartments at the same rate in July as in June, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, as construction eased from a boom pace earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Total starts in July were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.447 million, unchanged from June when starts increased a revised 3.2 percent from May. Wall Street analysts had forecast a slightly stronger 1.46-million-unit building pace for July.</p>
<p>The only region where building gained steam in July was in the Northeast. Starts there surged 41.4 percent to a rate of 157,000 a year, the strongest monthly gain since a 41.9 percent increase in November 1994.</p>
<p>But in the Midwest building rates were down 3.7 percent to 289,000, in the South they fell 2.4 percent to 663,000 and in the West they fell 5.3 percent to 338,000 a year.</p>
<p>Mortgage rates remain favorable by historical standards and job creation is brisk, so economists said there was no reason to worry about a continuing falloff in building.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no real sign of weakness in the housing sector,&quot; said economist Richard Berner of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. He added that building would add to the economy's third-quarter strength.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some moderation in the pace of new home building might provide the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee with additional reasons to hold interest rates steady at a session Tuesday.</p>
<p>New home building touched a peak rate of 1.554 million units a year in February amid exceptionally mild winter weather that fostered a spurt of building activity at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Analysts note that inventories of completed new homes for sale remain lean, so there is room for a steady building pace as the year wears on, if not a pickup in construction.</p>
<p>During July, starts on new single-family homes advanced 2.7 percent to 1.141 million a year, but apartment construction slumped 8.9 percent to a rate of 306,000.</p>
<p>New applications for building permits increased 1.4 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.422 million after falling 2.1 percent in June -- an indication that building activity likely will continue at a healthy level.</p>
<p>On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders said its index of market activity climbed in August to 58 from 56 in July.</p>
<p>&quot;Declining interest rates during most of the month helped improve customer traffic, current sales and builder outlook, the three components of the housing market index,&quot; said Kent Colton, the association's executive vice president.</p>
