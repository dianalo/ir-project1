<p>The U.S. economy is expected to slow from a sizzling 5.8 percent growth rate in the first quarter to more sustainable levels by the second half of the year, a top Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting growth to slow to potential growth by the second half of the year,&quot; Craig Hakkio, director of research at the Kansas City Fed, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said the cooling of the economy was expected to be across the board, adding that no specific sector would lead the way. &quot;It's sort of a slowing across the board. I don't see it being one sector leading the way,&quot; Hakkio said.  </p>
<p>The Kansas City Fed official said he believed the slowdown would spread its wings among several sectors of the economy, including retail sales, consumer spending, fixed business investments and housing.</p>
<p>Hakkio pointed out, however, the expected cooling did not imply the Federal Reserve was forecasting the economy would be crawling by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me emphasize that we're talking slowing from 5.8 (percent) to something more sustainable.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm not talking about slowing to something that's a concern to the economy in terms of recession or 1.0 percent growth. It's a slowing from a very high growth rate and not to a worrisome level,&quot; Hakkio said.</p>
<p>Although the economy has entered its seventh consecutive year of expansion, Hakkio said he believes there is still some pent-up demand left among consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have something left (in terms of pent-up demand). I don't think expansions die of old age,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Hakkio said inflation continues to be a missing person, but acknowledged that the risks of price rises remain on the upside. &quot;I think there's still an upside risk of greater inflation, but at this point we don't see it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Fed director said employment costs remain relatively under control despite tighteness in labor markets.</p>
<p>He said, however, he has noticed a small increase in overall compensation. But, he added, it was still too early to predict if such a phenomenon indicated the beginning of a trend.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing a slight pick-up in wages and salaries and a very modest increase in compensation.</p>
<p>&quot;But ... at this point it is so difficult to distinguish whether this is a fundamental increase in the rate of labor compensation or whether it's just a quarter-to-quarter bloat,&quot; Hakkio said.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Fed official said he uses a whole set of tools when trying to assess the current state of the economy.</p>
<p>Those tools include concepts like the Non-Accelarating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and indicators such as capacity utilization, health care costs and interest rates in the futures market.</p>
<p>The economist said, however, he did not find the NAIRU to be a suitable gauge of future inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the concept of the NAIRU makes sense,&quot; he said, but added that the lack of consensus among economists on where the NAIRU is in a given period, &quot;makes it difficult to use it as an indicator of future inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Forecasts from Wall Street economists currently put the NAIRU in a wide range between 5.0 and 6.0 percent. &quot;With the NAIRU changing over time, it's more difficult to use it as a tool for forcasting inflation trends,&quot; Hakkio said.</p>
