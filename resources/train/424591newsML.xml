<p>French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette on Thursday discussed with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara how to restart Damascus' peace talks with Israel, officials said.</p>
<p>They said Shara told de Charette that Damascus was ready to resume the negotiations Israel broke off a year ago but stressed they should begin from where they ended under Israel's previous government.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has rejected the concept of trading land for peace, says talks should resume without conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;If the current Israeli government is interested in peace then it should endorse the formula on which the peace process was based and commit itself to the outcome of talks which were held with the previous Israeli government,&quot; a Syrian official said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he would note but not necessarily accept the results of previous talks. Syria says the Labour government had agreed to return all the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;If each new government cancels agreements and commitments made by its predecessor it would be impossible to make parties trust each other,&quot; the Syrian official said.</p>
<p>De Charette, touring the region to revive talks between Syria, Lebanon and Israel, arrived on Wednesady from Israel where he had talks with Netanyahu. He was meeting President Hafez al-Assad before heading to Lebanon later in the day on the last leg of his tour.</p>
<p>Officials said Shara reiterated Syrian support for a larger French and European role in the peace process to supplement the United States role as the main sponsor.</p>
<p>De Charette had said on arrival that obstacles remained to a revival of Syrian-Israeli peace talks. Israel has held sporadic peace talks with Syria since 1991 without any breakthrough.</p>
<p>&quot;As you know there are many obstacles which are blocking the way of peace and France will try to solve these problems. I give big importance to the talks that I will have here with President Hafez al-Assad,&quot; de Charette said.</p>
