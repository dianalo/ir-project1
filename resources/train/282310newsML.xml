<headline>French stocks end last day of banner year lower.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>French stocks closed slightly lower on Friday after tracking bonds throughout a quiet session, but the blue chip CAC index advanced 23.71 percent on the year.</p>
<p>It closed down 2.90 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,315.73 on Friday after bond futures weakened in late trading on U.S. data showing strong home sales in November. The CAC-40 January futures contract finished 16.5 points lower at 2,311.</p>
<p>Volume was 4.8 billion francs, which was thin given that monthly futures and options contracts expired on Friday.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, market experts expect the bourse to continue rising next year but at a slower pace.  </p>
<p>Most analysts, portfolio managers and sales strategists interviewed by Reuters said they expected the CAC index to peak next year at around 2,450 points.</p>
<p>The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and volatility on Wall Street cloud the outlook for the bourse, but market operators say improving French corporate earnings and restructurings of several French industries will lend support.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's session didn't have any great significance. There were too few players,&quot; one trader said. Activity was muted as the Frankfurt market was closed and the London market closed early.  </p>
<p>* Many of the gains and losses on the CAC were linked to end-of-year window-dressing. Laggards such as Societe Generale were hurt. It closed down 1.58 percent at 561 francs. Lyonnaise des Eaux rose 2.14 percent to 482.90 francs.</p>
<p>* Car parts maker Sylea, a major supplier to Fiat , rallied 6.36 percent to 569 francs after the Italian government introduced incentives to boost car purchases. Sylea generated 38 percent of its 1995 sales with Fiat.</p>
<p>* Eurotunnel fell 2.84 percent to 6.85 francs. A Eurostar train broke down in the Channel Tunnel on Monday and was stranded for nearly three hours before being towed out.</p>
