<p>A plan to create a global bank to settle deals in the $1.2 trillion per day foreign exchange market is due to be unveiled this week but bankers on Monday said the project has some big hurdles.</p>
<p>A group of major banks, known as the Group of 20 (G20), is expected to issue a statement towards the end of the week. Some industry figures said it was informing central banks of its plans first.</p>
<p>Rob Close, Barclays Bank payments strategy director who is involved in the G20 project, was not available for comment ahead of the release.</p>
<p>But bankers in London identified several concerns, notably large costs, the existence of competitive systems, and the ramifications of concentrating so much power in one institution.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some very large question marks over it,&quot; said a London banker, who is not involved directly with the G20's work.</p>
<p>The G20, formed in 1994, includes ABN Amro, Banque Nationale de Paris, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Fuji Bank, HSBC Holdings, Royal Bank of Canada, Swiss Bank Corp, Societe Generale and UBS.</p>
<p>It wants to set up a clearing system based on the principle of Continuous Linked Settlements (CLS) -- effectively a system whereby deals are concluded when payments on both sides are simultaneously made.</p>
<p>This compares with delays of more than one day which sometimes occur in completing a settlement in the current system.</p>
<p>On a global scale, advocates say CLS would eliminate settlement risk, the type of risk that gives central bankers nightmares.</p>
<p>It is also often known as systemic risk or &quot;Herstatt risk&quot; after German bank Bankhaus Herstatt was shut down in 1974 and caused gridlock in the forex market due to uncompleted payments.</p>
<p>But the G20's plans, which involve large initial investments among members, follow years of work and investments by banks at netting systems and agreements.</p>
<p>Exchange Clearing House (Echo), created by a group of European banks, and Multinet in the U.S. operate netting systems which group foreign exchange deals and arrive at net amounts, either bilaterally or multilaterally.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a feeling a number of people have, which is, 'If Echo couldn't get lots of customers, why will this?',&quot; said a banker.</p>
<p>Some said the new plan could even cause firms to sit on the fence until it is clearer whether netting or a global settlment house will emerge as common industry practice.</p>
<p>At a time when central banks expect the industry to come up with its own solutions for dealing with settlement risk, this is an added danger, bankers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to see whether or not this is sufficient to convince the central banks that the market is making realistic efforts to control settlement risk,&quot; said Bob Blower, assistant director at the British Bankers Association.</p>
<p>Aside from the need to achieve critical mass, the G20 plan also must be cost effective, bankers said. &quot;The end result will be a service that the dealing side of the banks will find extraordinarily expensive,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>He said there were divisions at a number of the G20's members between the payments and the dealing side. &quot;The risk to the G20 folks is that an alternative will come around that will drive them away (from the current plan).&quot;</p>
<p>Some 90 percent of the currency market is estimated to be done for position rather than for banks to actually have the funds on hand. So one threat for the G20 would be if proposals for a &quot;contract for differences&quot; in the forex market gained more favour.</p>
<p>Bankers were quick to point out that such a contract itself would be complicated to engineer because of the need for industry standards such as currency fixings.</p>
<p>Among potential winners from the plan are the banks that would aim to become global clearers, essentially to ride on the back of the market's ballooning volumes.</p>
<p>But other banks, eager to gain a voice in the matter, have already set up their own organisation, known as the Group of 40 and including some 48 houses.</p>
<p>While the industry at the moment is being left to its own devices, some bankers said the authorities -- particularly the New York Federal Reserve -- also could introduce a note of concern.</p>
