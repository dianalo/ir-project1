<headline>Norwegian shares edge up, lacklustre trade.</headline>

<p>Norwegian shares rose marginally on Monday in trade that lacked a sense of direction, dealers said.</p>
<p>Oslo's Total share index closed 0.34 percent up at 1,113.10 points in turnover of 1.4 billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;In a market with such few impulses it is hard to make a case for a share,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said international investors were picking blue-chip stock here and there. Industrial conglomerate Norsk Hydro and forestry group Norske Skog were among the winners.  </p>
<p>But offshore service group Awilco fell 11.2 percent to 70.50 crowns after confirming a report by British Petroleum Plc last Friday that the troubled Foinaven oil field west of the Shetland Islands had been delayed again.</p>
<p>Awilco will continue to receive an undisclosed dayrate from operator BP to cover direct costs until the subsea system is ready.</p>
<p>Holding company Aker RGI fell 5.2 percent to 127 crowns after announcing it was increasing its stake in Norway Seafoods by 11.99 percent in accordance with an options agreement with Tiger Management LLC.</p>
