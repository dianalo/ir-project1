<title>GERMANY: Bundesbank declines comment on policy speculation.</title>
<headline>Bundesbank declines comment on policy speculation.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-07-30</dateline>

<p>The Bundesbank on Wednesday declined to comment on press reports, officials' comments and market speculation surrounding policy discussions at its last council meeting, stressing all such debate was confidential.</p>
<p>&quot;Bundesbank council meetings are confidential. There is no reason to deviate from this principle for the meeting that took place on July 24,&quot; Bundesbank vice president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum told Reuters through a spokesman in answer to enquiries.</p>
<p>Speculation was triggered last week when the Bundesbank declined to announce interest rates for the four securities repurchase tenders it will set during its four-week holiday.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank made clear the first two tenders will be at an unchanged fixed interest rate of three percent, but left its options open to change this for the second half of the period.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick on Wednesday told German daily Handelsblatt the Bundesbank would have to be very careful in setting policies at a time where the mark is relatively weak and economic growth remains fragile.</p>
<p>Financial markets were unnerved by Koebnick's comments this morning, particularly as the newspaper intimated the central bank could consider altering its policy course.</p>
<p>The report suggested that the central bank could set a securities repurchase tender at variable interest rates -- allowing banks to help determine the rates at which they will get funds -- alongside a further fixed rate repo pact.</p>
<p>Bundesbank officials themselves said the repo decision was designed to leave their options open in order to be able to react quickly and smoothly during more volatile conditions.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank also declined to comment on currency levels in response to the Reuters enquiries.</p>
<p>The central bank has made clear that it does not want to see the mark continue to weaken but has steered clear of a barrage of verbal comment to support the mark which some market participants expected after the dollar rose above 1.80 marks.</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at about 1.8410 marks at 1410 GMT.</p>
