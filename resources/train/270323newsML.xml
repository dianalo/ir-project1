<p>A future in which you can watch the latest play at home on your computer or download the latest Madonna song from the Internet came one step closer on Friday with the adoption of global pacts against piracy in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Some 800 negotiators from 160 nations, holed up for three weeks in a Geneva conference centre dubbed the &quot;bunker&quot;, approved the new copyright pacts by consensus of wrangling on who owns what on the Internet.</p>
<p>When ratified by signatory states, the ground-breaking pacts will protect digitally-transmitted sound recordings and the rights of their performers in the up-and-coming digital era.</p>
<p>&quot;These treaties we've been working on will be the cornerstone of international economic law for the information and technological age of the 21st century,&quot; said U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Lehman.</p>
<p>He told a briefing that the new treaties, which have to be approved by national legislatures, would be roadmap for copyrights on the information superhighway but piracy in cyberspace was unlikely to be fully stamped out.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been trying for 10,000 years of recorded history to prevent theft but we're still not successful. All we can do is to establish norms and try to keep theft under control,&quot; Lehman added.</p>
<p>Conference chairman Jukka Liedes said that in simple terms, the U.S. singer Madonna, for instance, would now be able to use Internet to distribute her music, have copyrights for it for the first time in the digital era and be paid for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Madonna will now have the possibility for the first time to make her works available on the Internet and have her rights respected in the digital environment,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Two treaties, on literary and artistic works and on rights of performers and producers of music, had been cleared for adoption on Friday while a third one on database producers -- considered dead from the start -- had been shelved.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came after heated battles on the conference sidelines pitting the multi-billion-dollar Internet and online community against copyright industries like music and software.</p>
<p>Both groups were pleased with the outcome.</p>
<p>&quot;We've now got the rights we needed to address this market,&quot; said Nicholas Garnett, head of the music industry lobby group, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry whose 1,100 members include big record producers BMG, EMI, MCA, Sony Music and PolyGram.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll see the Internet changing the rules of the music industry rapidly in the coming years with more and more direct contact between music producers and the public,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The $40-billion-a-year music industry says digital transmission of recordings could represent a $2 billion market.</p>
<p>The biggest sticking point over the most controversial article in the treaties concerning reproduction rights was cleared after the conference agreed to delete it altogether.</p>
<p>This is a victory for online companies who were furious that the article would have made even innocent Web surfing, which by definition requires that a computer make transient copies, a copyright violation.</p>
<p>The Internet community had said the article would expose them to multi-billion-dollar liability.</p>
<p>An official of the Ad Hoc Coalition, a broad lobby group representing online giants and telecommunications companies, welcomed the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done a lot of good here for the Internet. We're reasonably pleased,&quot; said Peter Harter of the Information Technology Association of America, a trade association.</p>
