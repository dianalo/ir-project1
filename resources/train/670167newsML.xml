<headline>Yuan ends up slightly vs US dollar in Shanghai.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-06-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Chinese yuan closed up slightly at 8.2925 on Wednesday from Tuesday's 8.2928 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai with some designated banks building positions in the local currency, traders said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Tuesday was 8.2928.</p>
<p>Dealers said some designated banks, both domestic and foreign, were seen buying the yuan after the midsession, possibly due to a lack of the local currency.</p>
<p>The yuan opened down at an intraday low of 8.2930 and rose slightly to move around 8.2925 for most of the session, hitting a high of 8.2920. Trading was dull with most business done at 8.2925.  </p>
<p>&quot;Buying by some designated banks pushed up the yuan on Wednesday,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>A second trader said the yuan faced heavy selling pressure at the 8.2920 level, which was regarded as a short-term resistance because the central bank usually intervened to depress the yuan at around that price.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the yuan to remain in a range between 8.2920 and 8.2930 on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The yuan closed down at an intraday low of 7.3250 from 7.3189 against 100 Japanese yen and slightly down at the day's low of 1.0724 from 1.0722 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
