<title>USA: Stocks, bonds fall as housing sales offset tepid GDP.</title>
<headline>Stocks, bonds fall as housing sales offset tepid GDP.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Stocks and bonds came under pressure Wednesday after government data indicating slower economic growth was offset by another report showing a smaller-than-expected decline in sales of new homes.</p>
<p>The dollar was lower against most foreign currencies, and soybeans and heating oil tumbled.</p>
<p>In stocks, the Dow Jones industrial average ended 13.79 points lower at 5,993.23. In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,180 to 1,171 on active volume of 437 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Stocks initially were buoyed by the government's report on gross domestic product, which said the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the three months from July through September -- less than half the booming 4.7 percent pace posted during the second quarter.</p>
<p>Prices later retreated, though, when a Commerce Department report showed new-home sales slipped a smaller-than-exected 0.5 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 816,000.</p>
<p>Even the GDP figure was seen as double-edged.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one side interest rates may ease, but on the other side the slowdown may mean slower earnings momentum,&quot; said Marty Kearney, a trader at PTI Securities.</p>
<p>In another report, the Federal Reserve said in its latest national summary, known as the Beige Book, that pressure for wage increases was mounting despite a slower pace of economic growth, but it saw few signs of a pickup in inflation.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the Treasury's 30-year bond was off 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face value, raising its yield to 6.71 percent from 6.68 percent at Tuesday's close, which was its lowest level in nearly 7 months.</p>
<p>The dollar tumbled to a 19-month low against the British pound after Britain's finance minister unexpectedly raised British interest rates.</p>
<p>The pound also jumped to its highest level against the German mark in almost two years after Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, authorised a quarter-point increase in British interest rates to 6 percent, the first rise since February 1995.</p>
<p>The pound extended its recent rally and touched $1.6345, its highest level since March 1995. It closed at $1.6330 late in New York, up from $1.6104 late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hurt by its slide against the pound, the dollar fell further from Tuesday's 42-month high of nearly 115 Japanese yen. The dollar fell to 114.13 yen from 114.35 yen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The dollar managed to recoup early losses against the mark, edging up to 1.5114 marks from 1.5105 marks late Tuesday.</p>
<p>In commodities trading, soybean prices tumbled on signs that export sales could be slowing, while heating oil prices fell after data showed stockpiles growing.</p>
<p>November soybeans fell 9 cents to $6.89-1/2 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade after almost 2 million bushels of soybeans were registered as eligible for delivery during the session.</p>
<p>The move was a strong sign that recent booming soybean exports could be cooling off, traders said.</p>
<p>Heating oil fell sharply and gasoline prices rose after weekly statistics on stockpiles released late on Tuesday. Crude prices ended little changed.</p>
<p>November heating oil fell 1.37 cents to 68.46 cents a gallon at the New York Mercantile Exchange. November unleaded gasoline rose 0.90 cent to 70 cents a gallon and December crude oil fell 6 cents to $24.28 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;The factors that pulled heating oil and crude up, like Middle East tensions -- specifically in Iraq -- and low heating oil stocks, are now losing their steam,&quot; said Paul Ting, senior oil and gas analyst with Salomon Brothers.</p>
