<p>Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters ruined by failed investment schemes poured through this Albanian port for the third day on Friday, while a smaller rally in the capital Tirana was halted by police.</p>
<p>The gathering in Tirana, attended by up to 1,000 people, was the first indication that the protests against the failed schemes had spread outside Vlore.</p>
<p>Albania's main opposition grouping planned a major rally for Tirana's central Skanderbeg Square on Saturday to press for President Sali Berisha's right-wing government to step down.</p>
<p>In Vlore, crowds of up to 30,000 massed in front of regional administration offices and the local headquarters of Berisha's Democratic Party before moving on to Independence Square, the site of demonstrations over the past two days.</p>
<p>&quot;Give us back our money!&quot; the crowd shouted outside the offices, guarded by rows of policemen. &quot;Vlore police, take off your uniforms, join us!&quot; cried the marchers.</p>
<p>The marchers dispersed before noon and pledged to regroup after nightfall. Police gave up attempts to disperse protesters earlier this week and have allowed them to move at will throughout the city.</p>
<p>Two young boys on horseback had led the procession down the city's main palm-lined boulevard. The marchers paused twice in front of a high school and technical college to persuade students to leave their classrooms and go into the street.</p>
<p>In Tirana, eyewitnesses said distraught investors massed outside the home of Sude, a Gypsy woman who ran a pyramid scheme which collapsed with 100,000 depositors owed about $60 million.</p>
<p>Riot police arrived in force and dispersed the gathering. Sude is one of several pyramid scheme operators under arrest.</p>
<p>Violent protests swept through Albanian towns last month in response to the collapse of five schemes promising quick, lucrative returns. Authorities cracked down by arresting more than 150 people and threatening them with long jail terms.</p>
