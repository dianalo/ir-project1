<headline>Dikes survive night, Polish border town fights on.</headline>

<p>The Polish community of Slubice on the German border survived another tense night as the Oder river again started to rise, threatening at any moment to seep through dikes and flood the town.</p>
<p>The government's crisis committee said on Wednesday the next flood wave should crest about half a metre below the point of spillage but that Slubice's eroded and sodden dikes could yield to the rising river despite a round-the-clock effort to shore them up.</p>
<p>&quot;If water levels do not exceed our prognosis, then the water will not top the dikes, but there are no guarantees that dikes will hold out,&quot; committee official Marek Sobczak told Reuters.</p>
<p>If there is no, or only light, rainfall in flood-hit south and western Poland in the next few days it should give much-needed relief to Slubice and hundreds of other Polish towns and cities threatened or already inundated in more than three weeks of floods.</p>
<p>Poland's weather institute said heavy thunderstorms would create day-long rainfall in the hardest-hit regions on Friday, but that the rain would stop on Saturday.</p>
<p>In Poland's worst flooding disaster, 54 people have died, 1,358 communities have been affected by flooding -- including 45 towns under water -- 162,000 people have been evacuated, more than 650,000 hectares of land inundated and billions of dollars of damage caused.</p>
<p>Sobczak said that over the last 24 hours flood waters covered another 220 hectares of land but receded from more than 2,700 hectares across the country.</p>
<p>More than 197,000 hectares (nearly 2,000 sq km) of Poland remain flooded.</p>
<p>The government has begun massive reconstruction of the affected areas. The government will consider introducing a special flood tax or tax-deductible bonds next year to help finance the rebuilding.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have strongly criticised the ruling coalition of ex-communists (SLD) and peasants (PSL) for the way they handled the crisis. The latest opinion polls show the SLD-PSL team was losing popularity as a result of the disaster.</p>
