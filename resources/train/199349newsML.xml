<p>Two leading Nigerian dissidents detained since January were freed on Tuesday, the state news agency reported.</p>
<p>It said lawyers Gani Fawehinmi and Femi Falana were freed on the orders of the military government.</p>
<p>The release appeared to have been timed to coincide with a meeting in the capital Abuja on Tuesday between the Nigerian military government and Commonwealth ministers appointed to press Nigeria to restore democracy and respect democracy.</p>
<p>The News Agency of Nigeria said both men were freed on the recommendations of a panel reviewing political detentions headed by the inspector general of police, Ibrahim Coomasie.</p>
<p>Government officials said a third detainee, Femi Aborishade, a member of Fawehinmi's unregistered National Conscience Party who has also been detained since the beginning of the year, was also freed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nigeria, in crisis since June 1993 when an election to restore democracy was annulled, has drawn international ire over the long detention of its opponents and last year's hanging of nine minority rights activists which caused it suspension from the Commonwealth.</p>
