<headline>Knoll settles suit over thyroid treatment.</headline>
<dateline>MOUNT OLIVE, N.J. 1997-08-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Knoll Pharmaceutical Co. said Monday it has agreed in principle to pay up to $135 million into a fund to settle a series of class action lawsuits involving its thyroid medication, Synthroid.</p>
<p>In April, Knoll and its parent, Germany's BASF AG, were sued for $8.5 billion for allegedly suppressing a medical study to control the U.S. market for thyroid drugs.</p>
<p>The suit alleged that Knoll, BASF and Boots Co. Plc concealed a university study concluding that Synthroid, a synthetic version of the compound levothyroxine, was no better than cheaper, generic brands.</p>
<p>The suit said Knoll, based in Mt. Olive, N.J., controls 84 percent of the $600 million-a-year levothyroxine market in the United States.</p>
<p>Knoll said it will contribute $98 million to the fund to cover payments to class members, legal fees and related expenses. If there are more than five million eligible claimants, Knoll said it will contribute additional payments that would bring the payments to a maximum of $135 million.</p>
<p>Knoll said in a statement that &quot;the settlement in no way implies or acknowledges any wrongdoing&quot; and added that the court had not ruled on the merits of the claims.</p>
<p>The proposed settlement remains subject to a definitive agreement and court approval, it added.</p>
