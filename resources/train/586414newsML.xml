<p>Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui confirmed on Thursday that Premier Lien Chan, under fire for a perceived breakdown of law and order, could step down after key constitutional reforms are carried out in July.</p>
<p>&quot;After constitutional reforms are completed, in conjunction with the new system, Vice President Lien Chan no longer will have to serve concurrently as premier,&quot; Lee said in opening remarks at his annual news conference.  </p>
<p>Lien, elected vice president as Lee's running mate in Taiwan's historic March 1996 popular election, has sat as premier or cabinet chief at the president's discretion under the island's half-parliamentary, half-presidential system.</p>
<p>Lien and his cabinet have come under fierce criticism in recent weeks over a spate of violent crimes that investigators have seemed at a loss to solve, ranging from the gangland-style execution of a county magistrate and seven others in his home to the kidnap-murder of a television celebrity's teenage daughter.</p>
<p>Lien has steadfastly resisted calls for his own head, but announced late on Monday that he intended to step down once an ongoing revision of the constitution is completed, likely in July.</p>
<p>The ruling Nationalist Party's proposed reforms have drawn fire for sharply increasing the powers of the president, something that opposition parties say jeopardises Taiwan's hard-won democracy.</p>
