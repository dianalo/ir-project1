<p>Gold jewelry demand is rising faster than gold mine output in the 1990's, and gold demand has remained robust into the early months of 1997, said George Milling-Stanley, New York based manager of market analysis for the World Gold Council (WGC).</p>
<p>&quot;Mine production is the primary component of supply and it has grown by an annual average rate of 1.3 percent in the 1990's,&quot; Milling-Stanley told the annual conference of Gold and Silver Institute here.</p>
<p>&quot;That may rise a little in the future, but mine production has a long way to go to catch up with jewelry consumption, which accounts for four fifths of total demand,&quot; he said. &quot;From 1990 to 1997, the average annual rate of growth in jewelry demand has been around four percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Gold demand was strong in the fourth quarter of 1996 and full year 1996 demand remained close to the previous year's record, sustained by jewelry demand, despite a drop in investment demand, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, demand at the beginning of 1997 has been running at its highest level for four years or since the early 1993 when the price of gold was around $325 an ounce,&quot; he said. &quot;There are reports of shortages of gold in many distribution centers, coupled with refineries all over the world running at full capacity, leading to delivery times that are much longer than normal.&quot;</p>
<p>Imports of gold into Dubai, a major entrepot center for distribution to India and the Far East, have been running at record levels this year, he noted.</p>
<p>Dubai gold imports reached 46 tonnes in January and 56 tonnes in February, a new record.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been suggestions that the strength of physical gold demand last year can be easily explained by the steady weakening in the gold price,&quot; he said. &quot;But the decline was essentially confined to the US dollar price, while the rise in the dollar during the year meant gold prices in other currencies, such as the yen, sometimes went up last year.&quot;</p>
<p>The World Gold Council's index of gold prices in local currency terms in the major consuming markets, weighted according to the size of gold consumption, was very steady last year, in contrast to the price in US dollars, Milling-Stanley noted.</p>
