<p>Northern European rapeseed prices are holding up on local demand, ignoring a looming near-term reversal in the Chicago soy complex, brokers said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Rapeseed from the old and new crops sold well in the past week and prices in the next few weeks look stable because of the tight oilseeds scenario,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Processors were relatively well covered with sunseed and soybeans but this did not weigh on the rapeseed price because of generally good crushing demand, he added.</p>
<p>Old crop buyers free Hamburg were at 480 marks a tonne, five marks higher than a week ago.</p>
<p>New crop buyers free Hamburg were at 448 marks, up three from last Friday.</p>
<p>Prices were seen easing with the arrival of Brazilian new crop soybeans but that was expected only at the end of March or early April.</p>
<p>Brokers also noted active rapeseed dealings on the Matif exchange, where May was up five marks at 480 and August up three at 458.</p>
<p>Farmers in eastern Germany reported active negotiations on pre-harvest 1998 sales contracts.</p>
<p>March rapeseed buyers at points other than Hamburg were at 470-480, April buyers at 480 and August buyers at 440-455.</p>
<p>March rape meal ex Hamburg mills was at 31.50-32.00 marks per 100 kg, April at 31.25 and May-first half July at 29.75.</p>
<p>German rape oil sellers quoted March at 89.00 marks per 100 kg, April at 90.25 and May-July at 91.50.</p>
