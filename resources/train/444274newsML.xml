<p>Tax experts on Friday urged the Hong Kong government to do more to prevent the outflow of companies seduced by lower tax regimes in other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;Ours is a low-tax regime but the point is, there are specific industries targetted by Singapore, by other countries,&quot; Kaushal Tikku, a partner with Price Waterhouse, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Do we want to compete with these other countries or do we want to sit back?&quot; Tikku told reporters after a speech at a Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce luncheon.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, average corporate tax rates stand at 16.5 percent, compared with 26 percent in Singapore, 30 percent in Malaysia and Thailand and 35 percent in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Still, strong efforts by the rest of Asia to make itself competitive has drawn a chorus of pleas from experts in Hong Kong for the territory to keep ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>Citing that Singapore extends a 10 percent corporate tax rate to its funds management industry, and that Hong Kong has in the past given special incentives to its shipping industry, Tikku recommended that the same be done for other sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past, there have been some specific incentives given to some industries, we may extend that...a tax review is long overdue,&quot; said Tikku.</p>
<p>Taking their cue from the 1997/98 budget speech given by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang on Wednesday, which highlighted a surplus of HK$15.1 billion by the end of March 31 and aspirations of becoming a high-tech centre, speakers also urged the government to start with concrete action.</p>
<p>Roddy Sage, partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said the government should turn its attention to the housing problem, where exorbitant, and still spiralling prices, could actually drive talented young Hong Kong people out.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going to be able to keep the next Bill Gates here? Can he rent a flat...a factory?&quot; Sage said.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the real issue...the land cost and the price of being able to do business here is the issue,&quot; Sage said.</p>
<p>He urged the government to release more land and to ensure property developers do not sit on purchased land.</p>
<p>Sage also said it was reassuring that future leader Tung Chee-hwa recognised the urgency of Hong Kong's housing problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I think it is a good sign, because I think what he does is recognise the problems...and they will look at it and do what's right,&quot; Sage said.</p>
<p>Tung, in a television interview two weeks ago, said bread-and-butter issues were of more concern to the territory's 6.4 million people than political liberties.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a spiralling cost of housing...mismatch of skills, education...these are the real problems which people care about,&quot; Tung had said.</p>
