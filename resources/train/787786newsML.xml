<p>Lower-than-expected new subscriptions for personal handyphones, a cut-rate mobile phone designed for those not needing a full cellular service, are a sign the system is being dropped in favour of more expensive rivals, industry analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The net increase in the number of subscribers to the personal handyphone system, or PHS, was 107,400 in July, only half that in June, according to industry data.</p>
<p>Rival cellular phone operators acquired a million new subscribers during the month.</p>
<p>PHS is a Japanese technology halfway between cellular and cordless phones. It costs less than full-powered cellphones but has more range than a regular cordless phone.</p>
<p>The sales data battered the shares of Japan's largest PHS operator, DDI Corp, which were ask-only throughout the morning on the Tokyo bourse and then fell briefly to 677,000 yen, a new low for the calendar year. The shares closed 82,000 yen lower at 695,000.</p>
<p>Analysts said they would closely watch PHS sales data in the next two months.</p>
<p>&quot;The July figure indicates PHS's churn rate could have risen to a level close to 70 percent,&quot; said Eric Gan, analyst at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not expect a sharp recovery in the next few months.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that PHS operators would be forced to cut basic monthly rates to compete with cellular operators, which are making drastic rate cuts amid tough competition with market leader NTT Docomo.</p>
<p>Some analysts were even more pessimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;PHS will give in to cellular as a major mobile tool and will only survive in niche markets, such as in-house private network applications,&quot; said Toshiaki Iba, an analyst at ING Baring Securities.</p>
<p>Others said a sharp gain in subscribers in March and April, resulting from generous sales promotions, was to blame for the heavy cancellations in July and the phenomenon would be temporary.</p>
<p>&quot;Things will not be so bad after September,&quot; said Hironori Tanaka, an analyst at Yamaichi Research Institute.</p>
<p>DDI has said it aims to acquire 1.4 million new PHS subscribers in the year to March 31, 1998.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the July data was in line with DDI's original planning.</p>
