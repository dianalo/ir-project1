<title>SINGAPORE: Asia's oil derivatives market in infancy - survey.</title>
<headline>Asia's oil derivatives market in infancy - survey.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-04-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asia Pacific oil market is still in its infancy in using futures and derivatives for trading and risk management purposes compared to its Western counterparts, according to a survey published in Singapore.</p>
<p>The survey, received by Reuters on Thursday, was conducted jointly by the Singapore Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) energy committee and the Singapore's Trade Development Board.</p>
<p>According to the survey, covering nearly 100 Singapore based oil companies in late 1996, the ratio of futures and paper oil trades to the underlying physical oil demand for Europe and North America was about four and 10 times respectively.  </p>
<p>But in the Asia Pacific region, this ratio was less than one time, it said.</p>
<p>The survey said Singapore was still predominantly a physical oil market, where real cargoes of oil were bought and sold.</p>
<p>But in the North American and European market, futures and derivatives trading were already very well-established, it said.</p>
<p>The survey said some 11 million barrels -- 5.8 million barrels of crude oil and 5.2 million of refined petroleum products -- were traded each day out of Singapore.</p>
<p>Of the 11 million barrels, 10.5 million barrels went to meet the Asia-Pacific's oil demand of 17.3 million barrels.  </p>
<p>While Singapore has a refining capacity of 1.3 million bpd, domestic consumption is only at 600,000 bpd.</p>
<p>Based on the survey, only some 1.5 million barrels of crude-oil, and 3.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products were traded each day in the derivatives, or &quot;paper&quot; market.</p>
<p>&quot;Physical crude oil traded in Singapore was some 5.8 million barrels per day (in the fourth quarter of 1996) compared with Singapore's refining capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day. Participants in the Singapore oil market trade substantially for their overseas associates.&quot;  </p>
