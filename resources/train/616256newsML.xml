<p>The Solidarity-led alliance of opposition rightist parties unveiled its election programme on Tuesday, promising crucial institutional reforms and a chance for all to share in Poland's economic success.</p>
<p>Solidarity Election Action (AWS) chairman Marian Krzaklewski said the programme sought to give local governments more power, overhaul public services and create a more equitable society while ensuring continued economic growth. @</p>
<p>&quot;We now have a chance to build a Poland in which every family will be given a chance, not just a small elite,&quot; Krzaklewski told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said AWS experts had prepared draft laws on reforming the social security and health care systems, on privatisation, returning assets confiscated under communism to their former owners, vetting of public officials and a pro-family tax system.</p>
<p>AWS and the ruling ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) are the front runners ahead of September parliamentary elections, with 20-25 percent each in popularity rankings.</p>
<p>Krzaklewski said the AWS programme recognised that sustained growth and a healthy economy based on market principles and private property were the key to achieving social goals. @</p>
<p>&quot;A condition of achieving all those goals is the economic success of this programme which will secure a high rate of growth...and allow creation of new jobs,&quot; Krzaklewski said.</p>
<p>He said the drafts would be made public following the announcement of the full version of the programme. This should happen in several weeks, he said.</p>
<p>Asked how AWS wanted to reconcile pledges to improve social services such as health care and education with promised tax cuts and pledges to keep a tight grip on the budget deficit and inflation, Krzaklewski said: @</p>
<p>&quot;We will seek savings by...reducing the distribution of funds on the central budget level...and by moving tax collection to the local government level we will cut waste and make management of public funds more efficient.&quot;</p>
<p>Krzaklewski said AWS upheld its pro-NATO and pro-Europe stance but argued that Poland should negotiate such European Union entry conditions that would allow it to preserve its national identity.</p>
<p>&quot;We clearly talk about negotiating our entry into the EU, we are in favour of it, but with the preservation of those elements that determine the identity of our country,&quot; he said. @</p>
<p>Krzaklewski also said that as one of the programme's top goals was to make a final break with the communist past, AWS would seek to unite more than two dozen small parties into one right-centre party capable of successfully challenging the ex-communists, who dominate the ruling coalition.</p>
