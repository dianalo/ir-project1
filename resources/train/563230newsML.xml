<headline>Aetna earnings beat analyst forecast, stock soars.</headline>
<dateline>HARTFORD, Conn. 1997-05-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Aetna Inc. reported higher-than-expected first-quarter profits Tuesday due to growth in all three of the health insurance giant's main business areas, triggering a jump in its stock.</p>
<p>The Hartford, Conn.-based company's net income was $279.3 million, or $1.85 a share, compared with $347.7 million, or $3 a share, in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Operating earnings, however, increased to $186.8 million, or $1.14 a share, from $165.5 million, or $1.07 a share, and beat the First Call service's consensus Wall Street analyst forecast for $1.05 a share. First quarter 1996 operating earnings excluded health maintenance organisation U.S. Healthcare, which Aetna acquired last July 1996.</p>
<p>Revenues reflected the acquisition, increasing 34 percent to $4.49 billion from $3.34 billion in the year-ago period, Aetna said.</p>
<p>Aetna reported its earnings before financial markets opened. Following a brief delay due to a trading imbalance, the stock surged, rising $5.75 to $96.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Our efforts to reposition Aetna began to pay off in the first quarter of 1997,&quot; Aetna Chairman Ronald Compton said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Earnings from all three of our core businesses -- health, retirement services and international -- grew at double-digit rates from the prior-year quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aetna U.S. Healthcare, the company's health insurance arm, reported $140.6 million in operating earnings after a $74.4 million charge, compared with $79.9 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Aetna U.S. Healthcare significantly lowered operating expenses&quot; due to changes made last year, Compton said.</p>
<p>Aetna Retirement Services -- which sells life insurance as well as annuities and other retirement and investment products -- posted operating earnings of $52.9 million, up 14 percent from $46.3 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Aetna International, which primarily sells life insurance as well as health and financial services products in emerging markets, also saw a 14 percent rise in operating earnings, to $27.5 million from $24.1 million.</p>
