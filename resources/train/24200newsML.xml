<p>Surinam's ruling New Front coalition was left in tatters on Friday after one of the four coalition members announced it would side with the opposition in a vote to choose a new president next week.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Party for National Unity and Solidarity (KTPI) said late on Thursday it had joined the opposition block led by former military strongman Desi Bouterse's National Democratic Party (NDP).</p>
<p>It was the second major defection from the New Front since May 23 national elections and left President Ronald Venetiaan's bid for re-election in serious doubt. Venetiaan faces Jules Wijdenbosch, right-hand man to Bouterse during the military regime of the 1980s, in a Sept. 5 vote of the 869-member United Peoples Assembly (VVV).</p>
<p>The latest jockeying leaves the two main political forces evenly matched. A simple majority in the VVV, which includes national, regional and district councilors, is enough to claim the presidency and form a government.</p>
<p>The walkout of the KTPI, made up of descendants of 19th century Javanese indentured labourers, means that even should Venetiaan win he would not have a governable majority in the national assembly, where the New Front now controls just 22 of the 51 seats.</p>
<p>KTPI Chairman Robby Dragman said his party agreed to join the NDP on condition that Bouterse holds no public office and human rights abuses during his regime are investigated.</p>
<p>The former Dutch colony of 400,000 people has endured two military coups, seven years of dictatorship and widespread guerrilla activity in the last two decades.</p>
