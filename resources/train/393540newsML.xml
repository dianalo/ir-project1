<p>The World Bank said on Friday it hoped to mobilise support from the European Union to help debt-ridden Bulgaria overcome a grave economic crisis.</p>
<p>A World Bank team led by South East Europe department director Kenneth Lay was due to start talks on Saturday on fresh funding for the crisis-torn country.</p>
<p>It was expected to meet interim Prime Minister Stefan Sofianski and President Petar Stoyanov on Saturday.</p>
<p>Lay told reporters on his arrival that he would travel to Brussels on Monday to co-ordinate the assistance needed to prevent economic collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be in Brussels...to further the process of trying to marshall assistance to important reforms we have confidence are going to be taking place here in Bulgaria,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended desperately needed funding for Bulgaria last year after the ruling Socialists failed to carry out planned structural reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;(The bank) wanted to convey to the government this weekend our commitment to doing our best to try to help Bulgaria get through the situation,&quot; said Lay.</p>
<p>The Socialists stepped down from power earlier this month after 30 days of massive protests fueled by economic hardship. They agreed to opposition demands to hold early general elections on April 19, 20 months before the end of their term.</p>
<p>Stoyanov, elected with opposition support, appointed an interim cabinet which inherited paralysing fuel and bread shortages, stagnant industry and enormous debts.</p>
<p>&quot;In a number of respects the really hard work here is just now beginning, with a good deal of sobriety we have to look forward to the results of the next several months and years,&quot; said Lay.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has still not fulfilled pledges under previous World Bank agreements to cut losses and subsidies in the economy, speed privatisation and maintain prices at levels sufficient to fully cover the costs of utilities like power, heating and transport.</p>
<p>Bulgaria pledged last year to close 64 loss-making state firms which would have reduced 28 percent of government subsidy costs, and to isolate from lending and stabilise a further 70 companies which would have cut 50 percent of the losses.</p>
<p>The World Bank Sofia residence mission evaluated reform progress as &quot;satisfactory...with liquidation and privatisation achieving about 65 percent of targets.&quot;</p>
<p>Bulgaria relies on external lending for around one billion dollar of debt payments due this year, a third of which is in the first quarter. An IMF negotiating mission is also due in Sofia next week.</p>
<p>Dealing with Bulgaria's 1.7 trillion lev domestic debt will also be a key item in discussions with the two lending institutions. --  Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561</p>
