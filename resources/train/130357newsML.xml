<headline>Mexico Cetes rate ends up on late supply, auction.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico's overnight Cetes rate closed up 255 basis points at a session high of 28.35 percent on Monday due to dealers dumping paper in late trade and expectations that primary rates would gain this week, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was dull, with rates between 27.5 and 28 percent for most of the session. Then rates gained at the close as dealers who had not yet covered positions and needed liquidity sold paper,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expect the bellwether 28-day Cetes rate to gain up to 150 basis points at Tuesday's primary auction.  </p>
<p>Banco de Mexico assigned 28-day Cetes at 25.90 percent at last week's primary auction.</p>
<p>In the term market, 28-day Cetes closed at 27.50 percent, well above the current primary rate, while 91-day and 182-day issues closed at 28.50 percent and 27.75 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The 91-day and 182-day Cetes drew rates of 28.75 percent and 29.05 percent, respectively, at last week's auction.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed 60 basis points up at 29.60 percent.</p>
<p>Credit maturities for Tuesday were expected to total a lower than average 1.0 billion pesos, but traders said that liquidity shortages would be increased by an estimated outflow of 7.0 billion pesos to pay corporate tax bills.</p>
