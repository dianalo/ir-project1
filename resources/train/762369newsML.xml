<p>Ivorian cocoa bean exports fell to 21,841 tonnes in June from 34,966 in May as port deliveries remained slack after the main crop season (Oct-April), official shipping data show.</p>
<p>Abidjan handled 12,963 tonnes of June 1997 exports with 8,878 tonnes shipped from the second Ivorian port, San Pedro.</p>
<p>Cumulative exports for the first nine months of 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) totalled 940,742 tonnes against 1,005,461 in 1995/96 and 719,063 the year before.</p>
<p>June exports in 1995/96 totalled 83,314 tonnes. Abidjan handled 56,410 tonnes in June 1996 and San Pedro 26,904 tonnes.</p>
<p>Exporters said they expected 1996/97 mid-crop (May-Sept) exports to rise in July and August as farmers had been drying large piles of cocoa along forest roadsides since June.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of mid-crop in some places,&quot; a southern coastal cocoa buyer, surrounded by large mats of drying cocoa, told Reuters at the weekend. &quot;Some bean sizes are bad but we are sending it all to port,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Trees in his area were less than seven years old and more productive than farms elsewhere with older stock.</p>
<p>Other buyers and exporters have said some cocoa is already being stored ahead of a widely expected farmgate price rise from October, but exports would still pick up from July, they said.</p>
<p>Details of receiving ports were not available for San Pedro but Abidjan sent 5,203 tonnes to Amsterdam and 4,035 to Hamburg, out of total shipments to northwest Europe of 9,592 tonnes.</p>
<p>Other shipments included 1,194 tonnes for Barcelona.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast produced a record 1.2 million tonnes crop in 1995/96 after an unexpectedly large mid-crop (May-Sept) of 200,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Bean quality remained high, without a usual decrease in size from main-crop to mid-crop. Exporters said bean quality for this mid-crop was beginning to improve after initial problems.</p>
<p>Farmers and buyers usually hold around 40-70,000 tonnes of mid-crop in stock to benefit from farmgate or international price rises as mid-crop seasons give way to the following main crop. The precise amounts crried over are never clear.</p>
<p>Some mid-crop cocoa is also mixed with generally better quality main crop to reach an overall export standard of 105 beans per 100 grammes at up to eight percent humidity.</p>
<p>July weather has been dry after June rains hampered drying of beans.</p>
