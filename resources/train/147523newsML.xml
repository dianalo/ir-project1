<p>Heavy losses in metals trading by a young employee at big Chinese conglomerate CITIC showed striking similarities to Nick Leeson's deals that humbled Barings Bank, a top CITIC official said.</p>
<p>CITIC -- the China International Trust and Investment Corp -- had learned a bitter lesson from the 1994 losses and had stepped up its internal controls, group executive director Chang Zhenming said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of similarities,&quot; Chang said of the CITIC and Barings episodes.</p>
<p>&quot;We realised the seriousness of risk,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>CITIC has gained a reputation of being one of China's best run companies, expanding its operations to power, telecommunications, banking and real estate. It is probably best known for its Hong Kong-listed unit, CITIC Pacific.</p>
<p>Its big losses in 1994 were all the more surprising to many foreign businessmen.</p>
<p>The key figure in CITIC's trading was Chen Tongsheng, in his early 30's, who worked at the CITIC Shanghai office.</p>
<p>Like Leeson, who was 28 when his big losses on Singapore's SIMEX exchange emerged, Chen was not a university graduate.</p>
<p>He had worked his way through to his trading position, taking a post as a bank clerk after finishing high school.</p>
<p>Also like Leeson, he is now in jail -- along with his supervisor, the former president of the Shanghai operation.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only was the background of the trader similar (to Leeson) but so were the trading methods as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Chang said that losses stemmed from unauthorised trades on the London Metals Exchange, and that broker credits compounded the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't have any money. He used LME broker credits,&quot; said Chang of the Shanghai trader.</p>
<p>Asked if special accounts were used to hide losses -- as in the Barings case - Chang said: &quot;You could say it was exactly the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Auditors were also unable to make sense of the trading accounts, he added.</p>
<p>But unlike Barings, CITIC managed to survive the losses, which were about $40 million compared to Leeson's, which neared $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Chang said the losses still nearly bankrupted the CITIC Shanghai operations.</p>
<p>&quot;We have stepped up our internal controls,&quot; he said, adding that other prominent cases - such as Sumitomo's copper trading losses -- had been instructive in reducing future risk.</p>
<p>CITIC's subsidiaries are no longer allowed to conduct operations unrelated to their core activities.</p>
<p>CITIC has also stopped all commodities trading on foreign markets, in line with a central government directive.</p>
<p>Asked if the company might return to the market, Chang said this was unlikely in the near future.</p>
