<p>The Brazilian government faces another tussle with the Chamber of Deputies this week, this time over its plan to extend a controversial Fiscal Stabilization Fund (FEF) that eats into the budgets of mayors and state governors.</p>
<p>Fresh from clinching a narrow, key civil service reform victory last week, whips were reported to have spent the weekend looking for a way of getting a three-fifths majority to extend the FEF until 1999.  </p>
<p>The FEF allows the government to hold on to 20 percent of receipts earmarked by the constitution for spending by states and municipalities, plus the tax receipts of federal workers.</p>
<p>That adds up to about $26 billion a year which is used to plug holes in the federal budget before the remainder is passed on to local authorities.</p>
<p>The fund was introduced as an emergency measure in 1994, shortly after the launch of Brazil's real currency. Since then, in the absence of structural reform, it has proved itself as a key fiscal tool.  </p>
<p>&quot;The government has grown accustomed to the FEF and it can't give it up right now,&quot; said a Planning Ministry official.</p>
<p>However, with the 1998 elections looming, and mayors revelling in their power to make or break the campaigns of federal lawmakers, the government faces a battle to get the two three-fifths majorities in the lower house to extend the FEF.  </p>
<p>A latest version of the fund expired June 30 without agreement on the details of its replacement. Despite concessions from Brasilia, an influential mayor's lobby is holding out for as much as it can get from the extension which will be retroactive to June 30.</p>
<p>Congress-watchers expect the issue will be settled by last-minute negotiations either Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<p>On the reform front, the government's civil service reform bill stands little chance of being put to its second and final full vote in the Chamber of Deputies until early August.  </p>
<p>But its pension reform bill could be voted by a Senate panel Tuesday or Wednesday. If approved, the bill would advance to the floor of the Senate where it needs two three-fifths majorities.</p>
<p>The chances of pension reform clearing Congress before 1999 look slim, however. The bill must return to the Chamber of Deputies for approval of changes made in the Senate and few expect the lower house will do that before the 1998 elections.</p>
<p>One important piece of legislation set to become law this week is a bill regulating the opening up of Brazil's oil and gas sectors to the private sector. Already approved in the lower house, the bill is scheduled for a final vote on the Senate floor Tuesday.</p>
<p>And in the Chamber of Deputies, a committee was due to vote on a bill setting down rules for next years's presidential, congressional and state governorship elections.</p>
<p>The bill would limit the re-election campaigns of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and state governors by restricting their access to television and radio networks in the run-up to election day and preventing them from inaugurating public works.</p>
