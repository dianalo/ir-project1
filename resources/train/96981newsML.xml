<p>Wall Street stocks will see their brief waiting game draw to a close on Friday, with release of the key September U.S. payrolls report.</p>
<p>On Thursday, markets quieted considerably, adopting a cautious tone ahead of the closely watched jobs data, which markets view as an important leading inflation indicator.</p>
<p>&quot;The market went from frothy to flat&quot; as release of the report neared, said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co, &quot;so some sort of bounce is likely to result from the report.&quot;  </p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters forecast a 166,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in September after a 250,000 increase in August.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is expected to edge up to 5.2 percent from 5.1 percent and average hourly wage growth is seen dipping to 0.2 percent from a 0.5 percent rate in August.</p>
<p>&quot;The headline number will be the payrolls,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. &quot;But the composition of wages paid will also be watched carefully.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Anything above 200,000 (in payrolls) would be hurtful,&quot; he said, adding that a payrolls figure below 125,000 would likely offer enough incentive for markets to rally.</p>
<p>In Toyko, stocks declined ahead of the U.S. jobs data. The Nikkei 225 index slid 183 points to 21,148.</p>
<p>In London, U.S. stocks also eased ahead of the report. The FTSE 100 fell 15.5 points to 3984.5.</p>
<p>The dollar was firm in Tokyo, holding near 111.5 yen, and was steady in European activity at just above 1.53 marks.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were firm in early activity. The benchmark 30-year bond rose 9/32 to push its yield down to 6.82 percent.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P 500 index futures were unchanged at 697.7.</p>
<p>The New York Times Marketplace column reports that Wall Street analysts are pleased with Hilton Hotels Corp's recent round of acquisitions and deals.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column notes that investors have been bidding up shares in Nabsico Holdings Corp even as analysts have been trimming earnings estimates.</p>
