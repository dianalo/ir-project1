<p>Stad Rotterdam anno 1720 NV, ranked sixth largest among Dutch insurers, said on Wednesday it was aiming to increase its portfolio in life business compared to non-life.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 70 percent of premium income from life business would be ideal,&quot; chairman Carlo de Swart said in an interview, noting that currently about 52 percent of premium income comes from life.</p>
<p>Stad Rotterdam said it expected premium income of its life business to increase to 1.6 billion guilders in 1996 from 1.5 billion guilders in the previous year.</p>
<p>Premium income from non-life was seen rising to 1.5 billion guilders in 1996 from 1.4 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Stad Rotterdam said it based the 1996 estimates on its nine-months results, which were published on November 14.</p>
<p>De Swart said it would remain focussed on accident and health, despite its increasing attention to life business.</p>
<p>&quot;Premium income in accident and health has been growing like mad,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>De Swart said the aim was to increase business especially in unit-linked products and individual pension schemes. &quot;Life business is in any case a good field to be in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>De Swart said unit-linked products had proven to be very profitable.</p>
<p>The chairman said it would put less emphasis on motor insurance as this business had been very cyclical.</p>
<p>Earlier he said the company was expecting a moderate profit in motor insurance in 1996, after announcing losses in the last few years.</p>
<p>De Swart said it had increased its technical reserves for motor insurance. &quot;This used to be 48 percent of premium income, but we increased this to between 90-100 percent,&quot; De Swart said.</p>
<p>Premium-income on motor insurance was expected to have increased to 380-400 million guilders in 1996 from 363.1 million in 1995.</p>
