<title>THAILAND: Thai government budget misleading - opposition.</title>

<p>Thai opposition leaders on Thursday accused the government of misleading the public with its 1998 budget, and warned that current spending plans could give the country a deficit in 1997/98.</p>
<p>Former finance minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda of the opposition Democrat Party led the attack on the proposed 982-billion-baht ($39.3-billion) budget on the second day of a scheduled three-day debate on the budget bill in parliament.</p>
<p>Tarrin said the government, which has seen its tax revenue crumble this year due to a severe economic downturn, would end the 1997/98 (October-September) fiscal year with a 45-billion-baht budget deficit.</p>
<p>When the government introduced the bill in parliament on Wednesday it projected a balanced, deficit-free budget for 1997/98, following a 63.16-billion-baht deficit in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Tarrin predicted that Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's six-party coalition would post a slightly higher 65-billion-baht deficit in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>&quot;The government will fail in its goal of pursuing a balanced budget if it adopts the 982-billion-baht expenditure bill...it is risking the credibility of Thailand's last defence wall, its fiscal discipline if it refuses to trim the budget for next year,&quot; Tarrin said during the debate.</p>
<p>Cabinet ministers said this week the government would ask state enterprises to raise their revenue contributions next year by 16 billion baht to help fill a possible revenue shortfall. They said no tax hikes were being planned.</p>
<p>Chavalit has called the budget an austerity bill that reflected the Thai economic slowdown that began before his government took office last November.</p>
<p>Thailand faces its slowest economic growth in more than a decade this year. The prime minister has forecast growth would ease to 5.6 percent this year against 6.4 percent posted in 1996.</p>
<p>Adding to Thailand's troubles are sluggish exports, high interest rates, a baht that has come under speculative attack and a stock market at eight-year lows.</p>
<p>Thailand's ailing and cash-strapped finance sector is also in disarray, with heavy loan over-exposure to the glutted and depressed property sector.</p>
<p>The government last month trimmed the 1997/98 budget by 26.59 billion baht, taking into account an expected tax revenue shortfall in that fiscal year.</p>
<p>Tarrin said a government plan to squeeze more revenue out of state enterprises would hurt business and the general public as these agencies would be forced to raise utility charges.</p>
<p>Education Minister Sukavit Rangsitphol bore the brunt of opposition attacks for the second day for his proposed 9.7 billion baht in planned subsidies for government and private educational institutions.</p>
<p>The opposition accused Sukavit of over-spending on what it called his loosely worded plan to buy computers for small rural schools.</p>
