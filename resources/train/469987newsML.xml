<title>NETHERLANDS: ROBECO CAUTIOUS ON SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS.</title>
<headline>ROBECO CAUTIOUS ON SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS.</headline>

<p>The Robeco group of investment funds said on Wednesday it remained cautious on the short-term prospects for international share markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Many exchanges are now driven by the big flow of liquidities and are thus vulnerable,&quot; chairman Piet Korteweg told a news conference on the annual reports of the group's three largest share and fixed income funds.</p>
<p>Board member and head of investment policy Jaap van Duijn said he saw a downward correction on the share markets &quot;of some size&quot; later this year but added that the group's share funds were still almost fully invested and had minimal cash positions.</p>
<p>Korteweg said any correction would be for a rather short period and would be no reason to drastically change the group's longer term policies.</p>
<p>&quot;People always make too much fuss about a correction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In its 1996 annual report, share investment fund Rolinco was more optimistic on 1997 than its counterpart Robeco , which has a slightly lower risk profile.</p>
<p>But Rolinco manager Gerard de Bruin said he had also adopted a more cautious approach in recent weeks because of falling share prices and interest rate trends.</p>
<p>Rolinco sold some of its investments at high prices earlier this year and now had a small cash position, after starting the year &quot;more than fully invested&quot;.</p>
<p>Korteweg saw two, or possibly three scenarios, for the rest of this year.</p>
<p>One was a situation where economic growth turned out to be stronger than expected. This would cause monetary measures to curb growth, which would send share and bond markets down.</p>
<p>But if economic growth lagged behind expectations, interest rates would fall, putting pressure on share markets.</p>
<p>Korteweg said the Robeco group was not sure which of the two scenarios would emerge and even did not exclude a &quot;Goldilocks scenario&quot; where economic growth would be as expected.</p>
<p>The group was therefore flexible in its investment policy and ready to switch between categories if necessary.</p>
<p>Korteweg said yesterday's U.S. interest rate rise was not strictly necessary, given the state of the country's economy and inflation levels, but it was a sign that any possible growth of inflation would be immediately dealt with.</p>
<p>He was doubtful whether more interest rate rises would follow in the United States at short notice.</p>
<p>The Robeco group's total assets under management grew to 81.5 billion guilders in 1996 from 72.4 billion in the previous year. In the first two months of 1997 a further rise to 87 billion was posted.</p>
<p>Shares in Rolinco, which has assets totalling 5.7 billion guilders, rose by 25.2 percent in 1996 and the fund's net asset value grew by 25.4 percent.</p>
<p>Robeco, with total assets of 10.5 billion guilders, posted a net asset value rise of 27.4 percent in 1996 and the fund's share price grew by 28.6 percent.</p>
<p>The Robeco group's fixed income fund Rorento , which manages total assets of 6.7 billion guilders, last year posted a rise in net asset value of 12 percent and its share price rose by 12.2 percent.</p>
<p>Rorento said in its annual report it expected another &quot;handsome&quot; investment result in 1997.</p>
