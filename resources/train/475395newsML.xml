<p>The death of a Georgia college student days after she returned from spring break in Florida has sparked concerns about the spread of deadly meningitis, authorities said Saturday.</p>
<p>People who shared food, drinks or utensils with the victim or were even in the same room with her could be at risk of contracting the bacterial meningitis that killed 18-year-old Lauren Tardiff Thursday, said Dr. Susan Griffis, an epidemiologist with the Volusia County Health Department.</p>
<p>Meningococcal meningitis, a highly contageous form of the disease, is spread by coughing or sneezing, Griffis said. That can be a problem during spring break, when college students often sleep nine or 10 to a room, sharing food and drink to cut expenses.</p>
<p>Volusia County residents are not at substantial risk, Griffis said. But some of the 200,000 college students who visit Daytona Beach for spring break could be exposed to the disease and carry it back to their homes or campuses.</p>
<p>Health officials in Florida and Georgia were trying to locate a group of University of Toledo students who spent time with Tardiff and her Kappa Delta sorority sisters.</p>
<p>Tardiff, a University of Georgia freshman, became ill Thursday morning, probably some three to 10 days after contracting the disease. She died a few hours later in a Marietta, Georgia, hospital.</p>
<p>Her family and known companions have all been located and given a preventative antibiotic, authorities said.</p>
