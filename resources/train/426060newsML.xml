<p>A war of words between Russian officials and big metals exporter Trans-World Group has upset potential investors to Russia's vast but impoverished metals sector.</p>
<p>&quot;People are going to be more reluctant to think about investment in Russia after this,&quot; Horst Peters, the Managing Director of Germany's VAW Aluminium-Technologie GmbH, said in the corridors of a London conference on commercial opportunities in Russia's metals sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The pay-back period for capital investment is about 15 years, so its very sensitive to these types of rumours,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Delegates to the conference discussed the pros of investing in Russia's metals industry as well as its cons -- fluctuating taxes, a non-payments crisis and a booming shadow economy.</p>
<p>But on everyone's mind was the furore raised last month when Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov called for more control over foreign participation in the aluminium industry.</p>
<p>Trans-World, which owns a substantial stake in Russian aluminium production, responded this week with an open letter slamming Russia's &quot;craven, political power play.&quot;</p>
<p>A Trans-World official at the conference told journalists the company had put on hold further investments into Russia over the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to see an official position by the government before we continue our investment programme in Russia,&quot; Mel Wilde, director at Trans-World (Steel) Ltd, told journalists.</p>
<p>In an address to the conference, Wilde also referred to other problems problems of investing in Russia, including unpredictable taxes, very high power costs, and a move by some Russian banks to seek a majority ownership in metal enterprises.</p>
<p>Trans-World announced earlier this week plans to spend $500 million in two large Russian aluminium smelters notwithstanding the stand-off.</p>
<p>Apart from Russian policies, Wilde also criticised what he called a U.S.-led anti-dumping campaign aimed at excluding commodities from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) from world markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this is protectionist policy which if successful will halt overnight CIS exports,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other delegates said the furore was disturbing but typical from a Russia-savvy investor's point of view.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't bother us personally because without the outside financing no one's going to make any money out of our project,&quot; said Simon Purkiss, Managing Director of Osmium Holdings S.A. of Luxembourg, which has a joint venture with Russia's massive Norilsk Nickel complex.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, implenting the measures Kulikov proposed would take about two years. There's obviously concern about this, but it's just part of doing business in Russia,&quot; Purkiss said.</p>
