<p>The European Union, eager not to offend Russia but with no intention of building hopes for eventual EU membership, struck a non-commital stance on Monday to comments from President Boris Yeltsin about joining the bloc.</p>
<p>&quot;We already have a long list of countries ready to join,&quot; British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on the margins of an EU foreign ministers meeting. &quot;Maybe that list will grow. Who knows?&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin said on Saturday following a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton that Russia was interested in cementing its role as a European country, including membership of the main economic body.</p>
<p>&quot;(Russia) is also aiming to be recognised finally as a full European state and we are also prepared to join the European Union,&quot; he told reporters in Helsinki.</p>
<p>Publicly, EU officials have sought not to snub Yeltsin, emphasising the need to establish good links and turning attention instead to the unfinished business between the two sides.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not exactly the time now to be speaking about membership,&quot; EU External Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek told Reuters, adding, however, that he was always reluctant to close the door on countries.</p>
<p>He noted that an EU-Russia partnership and cooperation agreement, signed in 1994, still awaited ratification in both Moscow and certain EU capitals.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for future negotiations on trade links, including the long-term prospect of a free trade agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We have for the years to come set the course...with this important partner,&quot; van den Broek said.</p>
<p>Failure to ratify the agreement has meant relations are now governed by an interim accord.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Sunday that completion of the main agreement had to come before any talk of further links.</p>
<p>Privately, EU officials rule out any idea of Russia as an EU member anytime in the near future, citing a geography that stretches far into Asia, an economy decades away from EU standards and concerns about the mere concept of letting in a country of Russia's size.</p>
<p>&quot;How European is it?&quot; asked one EU diplomat.</p>
<p>He noted that Russia was struggling to become eligible for membership of organisations such as the World Trade Organisation that were far easier to join than the EU.</p>
<p>The EU is already committed to bringing 10 former communist countries into the fold, probably starting with Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic.</p>
<p>The high cost of bringing those countries into the EU -- many of which are far more developed economically -- would be dwarfed by the price of getting Russia ready, the diplomat said.</p>
