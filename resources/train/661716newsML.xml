<p>A Sudanese government-owned newspaper reported on Saturday that rebels troops killed 142 people in the war-torn south and tortured a state official until he was forced to say he was joining the opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;The forces of rebel leader (John) Garang recently committed a massacre in the area of Wunrop in northern Bahr el-Ghazal province in which 87 children, 41 women and 14 elderly men were killed,&quot; the daily said.</p>
<p>It did not give any more details.</p>
<p>Garang heads the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), a rebel group fighting the government for almost 13 years for autonomy of the mostly Christian and animist south.</p>
<p>The daily also quoted travellers as saying the SPLA was holding and torturing Remzi Shir, the governor of the southern Buheirat state, after it had captured areas there.</p>
<p>&quot;Travellers from the town of Tonj say that Remzi Shir, who is nicknamed 'iron man', was subjected to brutal torture by the forces of rebel John Garang which forced him to send a message to the government through opposition radio in Asmara in which he announced he was joining the rebels,&quot; the daily said.</p>
<p>Tonj fell to the rebels last month and the newspaper quoted Lieutenant Colonel Osman Bol Tiran, the finance minister of Buheirat state, as saying they had also captured more than 160 state workers and officials.</p>
<p>Over the years, several groups have splintered from the SPLA and last month some of these signed a peace treaty with the Islamist Khartoum government.</p>
<p>The daily quoted the deputy leader of the government-loyal SPLA-Bahr el-Ghazal group as saying Garang's forces had also looted 203 head of their cattle and wounded eight of their troops.</p>
<p>Official reports say that SPLA-Bahr el-Ghazal leader Kerbino Bol captured five SPLA members near Wunrop in November and their whereabouts are as yet unknown.</p>
