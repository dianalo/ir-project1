<p>The U.N. refugee agency flew a first group of 58 Rwandan Hutu refugees out of a makeshift camp in eastern Zaire on Friday on their way home to Rwanda.</p>
<p>Craig Sanders, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representative in Goma, said the 58 were flown from Amisi camp, 300 km (180 miles) from the Rwandan border, to this Zairean city.</p>
<p>&quot;They were chosen because they are well enough to travel, but they are still in a poor condition,&quot; he told reporters. The refugees landed in Goma and were to be taken by truck back to Rwanda.</p>
<p>Groups of unaccompanied Rwandan refugee children earlier this week were flown out of Tingi Tingi and Kindu which have been overrun by advancing Tutsi-dominated rebel forces.</p>
<p>&quot;We can carry 50 or 100 back every day this way, but we cannot talk of an air evacuation of tens of thousands of refugees,&quot; said Sanders.</p>
<p>An estimated 400,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees remain in eastern Zaire but many are unaccounted for since they fled rebel advances on their camps near the border with Rwanda last year.</p>
<p>Nearly 2,000 refugees who were too sick or weak to run from the rebels remained at Amisi and Tingi Tingi camps when an estimated 170,000 others fled before deeper into Zaire last month.</p>
<p>Many of the Hutu refugees refused to return home, saying they feared reprisals for Rwanda's 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs.</p>
<p>Former Rwandan Hutu troops and militiamen have encouraged the refugees to keep walking deeper into Zaire's interior by telling them they will be killed by the rebels or on return to Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;Our soldiers kept telling us to run further but we are tired of running through the forest. It is better to go back to Rwanda and see what we can do there,&quot; said refugee Marie Grace Wase in Goma.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency is still trying to negotiate access with the rebels to a site at Ubundu on the Zaire river, where 150,000 refugees and displaced Zaireans have fled from the rebels.</p>
