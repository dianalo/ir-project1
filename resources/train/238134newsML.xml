<p>Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf will visit Jordan on Friday for talks with senior officials, Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sahaf's visit is part of a flurry of ministerial contacts between the two countries since Baghdad reached agreement last month with the United Nations for implementation of its long-delayed oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh passed through Amman this week on the way to Vietnam and is due to return for talks on Sunday with Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti. A Jordanian ministerial delegation is due to visit Baghdad soon.</p>
<p>Jordan, keen to capitalise on the slight easing of crippling six-year sanctions on its neighbour and trading partner, is trying to secure contracts to supply Baghdad with more medicine, vegetable oil and detergents exempt from the U.N. blockade.</p>
<p>&quot;Realistically, these are the goods that we can compete in,&quot; Muasher said.</p>
<p>Jordanian officials hope that trade ties with Baghdad will recover despite King Hussein's decision last year to turn against President Saddam Hussein and host Iraqi opposition groups calling for his overthrow.</p>
<p>&quot;There are differences, serious ones, politically. But this is a different matter altogether,&quot; Muasher said. &quot;We are one of the countries able to supply Iraqi needs at a competitive level. There is a will on both sides to cooperate in this.&quot;</p>
