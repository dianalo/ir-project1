<p>The Thai commerce ministry announced a lower-than-expected rise in the January consumer price index on Monday, confirming easing Thai inflation.</p>
<p>The ministry said retail consumer product prices and general cost of living rose 4.3 percent year-on-year in January after a 4.8 percent rise in December and against 7.4 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>It said the January index increased 0.2 percent over December against a 0.1 percent easing in the previous month and 0.5 percent in November over October.</p>
<p>Market analysts earlier expected January prices to rise 4.5-4.6 percent year-on-year and 0.3-0.4 percent month-on-month.</p>
<p>They said although petrol prices fell in the second half of January, Thais normally spent more in the month, especially on food, after annual salary adjustments.</p>
<p>Thai CPI rose 5.8 percent for the whole 1996, unchanged from the previous year.</p>
<p>The ministry said food and beverage prices rose 5.6 percent year-on-year in January with costs of flour products surging 12.7 percent, and meat and poultry prices rising 8.6 percent.</p>
<p>Nuchjarin Kasemsukworarat of Dhana Siam Finance and Securities said the January food price increase was seasonal. &quot;Food prices usually shoot up this time of the year, a few weeks before the Chinese New Year (February 7),&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The ministry said prices in the non-food sector, carrying 40 percent weight in the index, increased a more moderate 3.3 percent year-on-year in January.</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, that the moderating January inflation failed to lift a bearish Thai stock market.</p>
<p>The market has struggled since last week, with the steady weakening of the Thai baht and a strong U.S. dollar triggering a sell-off by foreigners seeking to minimise foreign exchange losses.</p>
<p>The composite SET Index dropped more than four percent to a 53-month low of 754.07 in early Monday afternoon trade before recovering slightly to 761.63 points late in the session.</p>
