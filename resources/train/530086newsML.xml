<p>Indonesia's state-run Joint Marketing Board (KPB) has delayed export shipments of about 20,000 tonnes of crude palm oil due to a drop in production, a KPB official told Reuters on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The shipments have been delayed to June from May because of a drop in production,&quot; the official said, adding that the volume was about 30 to 50 percent of its total monthly exports.</p>
<p>The official said he had no details on the production shortfall, but added that the agency's crude palm oil allocation to local refiners was not affected.</p>
<p>State plantations, which account for about 40 percent of total national production, export 30 percent of their output through the KPB and channel the rest to the domestic market.</p>
<p>Traders said production in Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer after neighbouring Malaysia, had declined steadily from late last year because of weather-related problems, and an insufficient supply of fertilisers to state-run plantations.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association had forecast 1996 output at 4.9 million tonnes, up from 4.5 million in 1995.</p>
