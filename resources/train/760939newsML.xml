<title>USA: U.S MUNICIPAL FOCUS - unchanged, directionless.</title>
<headline>U.S MUNICIPAL FOCUS - unchanged, directionless.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-28</dateline>

<p>U.S. municipal bonds were flat in early Monday trade, as the market waited for direction from two important economic reports due out this week, the second quarter Employment Cost Index and July payrolls.</p>
<p>&quot;We have some bid sides pretty much the same as Friday,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>While the recent big drop in yields has made a number of issues economic, inspiring several issuers to advance sales, traders said that the lack of robust demand for municipal bonds could prevent the market from keeping pace with Treasuries, if their prices were to continue rising.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect if you had a lot of money coming from refundings, we would definitely underperform,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>He cited the diminished appetite that mutual funds have for municipal bonds as their customers increasingly have turned to the hottest market in town, equities. Further, the decline in yields also has curbed retail investors' demand for municipal bonds.</p>
<p>Municipal bond sales for the week of July 28 were expected to total $3 billion in 103 sales, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.</p>
<p>Negotiated offerings total $2.033 billion in 51 sales, with a $340 million California Natural Resources offering through PaineWebber Inc., topping the list. To see the full negotiated sales calendar, double click on  NEGO1.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, 52 sales totaling $966 million are scheduled. A $250 million Maryland offering on Wednesday was the largest. This general obligation sale, along with a $101 million sale by Wisconsin on July 31, were expected to go smoothly.</p>
<p>&quot;They're nice, clean bonds,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The Employment Cost Index, which will be closely watched for any signs of inflation, was slated for July 29. A 0.8 percent increase was forecast by a survey of Reuters economists. The previous report showed a 0.6 percent rise.</p>
<p>And the other main focus, the payrolls data for July, which were due out August 1, was predicted at 193,000, down from the previous month's 217,000. The unemployment rate was predicted at 4.9 percent, down from 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>In Chicago futures markets, the September municipal bonds rose two ticks to 120-24/32, while the September Treasury bonds edged up one tick to 115-2/32.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, which the Standard and Poor's Blue List gauged at almost $1.4 billion, Dade County, Florida, Water and Sewer System Revenue bonds of 2026, were offered at 5.37 percent, NET, up two basis points. The bonds carry a 5-1/4 percent rate.</p>
<p>Florida Ports Financing Commission Revenues of 2027, which carry a 5-3/8 percent coupon, were bid at 5.50 percent, NET, unchanged.</p>
