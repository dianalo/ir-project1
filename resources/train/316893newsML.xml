<p>A United Arab Emirates official in remarks published on Saturday said the Gulf Arab state needed to inject a new element into its long-awaited formal stock exchange to make it successful.</p>
<p>Dubai Economic Department general director Mohammad al-Abbar said the UAE is expected to launch the formal bourse in 1997 but cautioned that the country should learn from the experience of other stock markets in the oil-rich region.</p>
<p>&quot;The standard of stock markets in the region is still average,&quot; he told Al-Khaleej newspaper. &quot;Therefore, we must inject a new element in our stock market.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts in the UAE say the formal bourse will not flourish without opening its doors to foreign investors and imposing tight regulations.</p>
<p>Gulf Arab states must develop their fledgling capital markets to lure home hundreds of billions of dollars invested abroad by their citizens and boost their oil-driven economies, economists say.</p>
<p>Some Gulf Arab states have moved to cross list shares on their bourses. But Saudi Arabia, the region's dominant political and economic power, has said it has no immediate plans to link its bourse with other Gulf Arab markets.</p>
<p>Shares are traded informally in the UAE by a handful of brokers who say a small number of people, limited by law to UAE nationals, actively deal in local stocks.</p>
