<title>TURKEY: Israeli helicopters help in Turk munitions blaze.</title>
<headline>Israeli helicopters help in Turk munitions blaze.</headline>
<dateline>KIRIKKALE, Turkey 1997-07-04</dateline>

<p>Two Israeli air force helicopters dropped water on a fire smouldering in the ruins of a Turkish munitions factory on Friday after a series of huge explosions that killed two people and caused widespread panic.</p>
<p>The U.S.-made Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters partially doused the flames at the plant in the half-deserted central town of Kirikkale.</p>
<p>New Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, on a visit to the town, said the risk of further explosions was almost over.</p>
<p>&quot;People can return to the evacuated areas when the danger has completely passed. People will be able to go home,&quot; he told reporters. The south of the town was emptied after the first blast on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Thousands of residents spent the night sleeping in their cars outside the town or camped out in nearby fields.</p>
<p>Blasts that sent flames 1,000 feet (300 metres) into the sky shook the town all day on Thursday, damaging houses, destroying the factory and causing an estimated one trillion Turkish lira ($6.7 million) worth of damage.</p>
<p>Yilmaz said it was still unclear what had caused the explosions, which stopped on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a number of possible reasons, including sabotage. The explosions might also have been caused by technical failure. This will all be made clear after an investigation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Anatolian news agency quoted Yilmaz's deputy, Bulent Ecevit, as saying inspections of the factory in 1996 and beforehand had found serious infringements of safety regulations.</p>
<p>Israeli air force planes have flown training missions over Turkey under a military agreement with Turkey which has angered Arab countries.</p>
<p>British officials said Turkey was considering an offer of firefighters and equipment from British bases on the nearby island of Cyprus. ($1=149,400 Turkish lira)</p>
