<title>USA: Airbus superjumbo may get partners - WSJ.</title>
<headline>Airbus superjumbo may get partners - WSJ.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Italy's Alenia, Sweden's Saab and a South Korean consortium may get involved in Airbus' effort to develop a &quot;superjumbo&quot; passenger jet, the Wall Street Journal said Wednesday.</p>
<p>In an interview, the senior vice president of Airbus' large aircraft division, Juergen Thomas, said Alenia plans to take as much as a 10 percent stake in the effort and Saab-Scania plans as much as five percent stake.</p>
<p>Thomas told the paper Airbus intends to obtain 33 percent of the funding for its jet, dubbed the A3XX, from European goverments, with half of that from European companies outside of Airbus and the other half from Asia and the U.S.</p>
<p>The rest would come from Airbus partners, he said.</p>
<p>The report quoted Thomas as saying that Airbus is &quot;very close to signing&quot; an agreement with Saab and that it hopes to conclude an agreement with a group of South Korean companies by the end of March.</p>
<p>In its European edition, the paper quoted Thomas saying Airbus was reviewing the antitrust implications of a planned merger between its archrival Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp of the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a very, very powerful company that could influence a lot of things,&quot; Thomas said. The Journal said his comments signalled that Airbus may step up pressure on antitrust officials to study all aspects of the merger.</p>
<p>Thomas reiterated that Airbus was confident about the superjumbo A3XX project and he said Boeing's recent scepticism about the project reflected dissatisfaction with its own 747-stretch design rather than insufficient market demand.</p>
<p>Thomas said he expected Boeing to eventually return to that segment of the market.</p>
<p>Airbus officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Airbus has publicly estimated the cost of the project at $8 billion, but outsiders estimate it will cost far more.</p>
<p>&quot;The Italians have announced they will take up to 10 percent in the program,&quot; Thomas was quoted as saying in an interview with the Journal. He said Airbus was &quot;very close to signing&quot; an agreement with Saab which intends to take up to five percent.</p>
<p>He said a Korean delegation, including officials from Samsung, Daewoo, Korean Air and Hyundai, had visited Airbus's Toulouse headquarters last month to discuss the project. He said his &quot;personal guess&quot; was that they would take a stake of between five and 10 percent.</p>
<p>He said he expected around 33 percent of the project financing to come from launch aid from European governments, 40 percent from risk-sharing partners in Europe and Asia and the rest from the Airbus consortium partners, Aerospatiale of France, Daimler-Benz, British Aerospace Plc and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.</p>
<p>Thomas said Airbus was talking to 17 airlines around the world about the final design of the A3XX. Airbus has said it hopes to formally launch the plane in December 1998 for delivery in 2003.</p>
