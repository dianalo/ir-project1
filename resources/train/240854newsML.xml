<p>Anti-corruption magistrates dealt new blows at President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR on Friday, ordering the party's personnel chief detained for another 24 hours and placing the Paris mayor's wife under investigation.</p>
<p>As probes into an alleged covert RPR funding system widened, justice sources said Xavier Dugoin, RPR president of the Essone regional authority outside Paris, had also been placed under investigation.</p>
<p>The sources said Louise-Yvonne Casetta, nicknamed &quot;la cassette&quot; (the cashbox) because she was regarded as RPR shadow treasurer, would be held for another 24 hours for questioning by Nanterre magistrate Patrick Desmure on suspicion of graft.</p>
<p>The sources said Casetta, picked up by police before dawn on Thursday, could be formally placed under investigation later on Friday. Her new detention order expires on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>She is suspected of misuse of corporate funds in connection with alleged illicit funding of the RPR by the construction firm Maillard et Duclos in 1992-93. Casetta was head of personnel at party headquarters until last September but is widely regarded as having been its main secret fundraiser.</p>
<p>Justice sources said she was questioned chiefly about links between RPR funding and public works contracts.</p>
<p>A Paris-region company executive has testified that Casetta effectively controlled access to City of Paris public housing contracts in exchange for cash payments for Chirac's party.</p>
<p>Jean-Claude Pittau, former head of the Mazzotti public works contractor, told the magistrate last June that his company had paid her at least 500,000 francs ($100,000) in cash over two years, the newspaper Le Monde reported.</p>
<p>Le Monde said the magistrate had already placed five businessmen under investigation for suspected corruption over their involvement in the false invoicing system.</p>
<p>Justice sources said Casetta worked closely with Jean-Claude Mery, a Paris consultant who is under investigation for alleged large-scale illicit fundraising on behalf of the Gaullist party.</p>
<p>In another case, judges in Evry outside Paris placed Xaviere Tiberi, wife of the RPR man who succeeded Chirac as mayor of the capital, under investigation for misuse of public funds, justice sources said.</p>
<p>Investigating magistrates Dominique Pauthe and Chantal Solaro notified her by letter, the sources said. Mayor Jean Tiberi's wife is suspected of having been paid 200,000 francs ($40,000) for a 36-page report largely copied out of a book.</p>
<p>The magistrates sent a similar letter to Dugoin who is suspected of paying out the sum.</p>
<p>France has been plagued since 1990 with a seemingly endless series of corruption scandals involving covert funding of all the major parties through rake-offs on public contracts.</p>
<p>The scandals first hit the late president Francois Mitterrand's Socialist Party and played a major role in its landslide general election defeat in 1993.</p>
<p>Graft-busting magistrates have since uncovered what they suspect was a huge covert funding system for the Gaullists based on rake-offs from public works contracts in the Paris region while Chirac was mayor of the capital.</p>
