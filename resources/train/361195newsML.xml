<p>Finland's biggest bank and its top insurers on Thursday said they had held unsuccessful merger talks, but analysts believe talks are bound to resume in some form, driven by the competitive prospect of a single currency.</p>
<p>Rumours of a merger between Merita Oy and either of Finland's top insurers, Sampo or Pohjola, have been around without a result for so long in Helsinki that the announcement was almost a surprise.</p>
<p>But Thursday's news, in response to a press report linking Merita and Sampo, made little impression on the companies' stock which has been outperforming since last autumn, helped by a cocktail of merger rumours for Nordic financial institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;For now the game has been called off -- but I wouldn't hold it unlikely that they will resume talks at some point,&quot; said Ilkka Salonen analyst at Postipankki.</p>
<p>All talk of financial institutions merging is part of a bigger picture: preparation for increasing competition within the single European currency area in 1999, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that competition will become more fierce in the single market area and thus we will be seeing a lot more of such cooperation talks,&quot; said Bengt Dahlstrom at Arctos Securities.</p>
<p>So far financial institutions in Finland have been relatively sheltered from outside competition, with only Swedish banks daring to enter the peripheral market -- but a single European currency would bring a significant change.</p>
<p>&quot;Size and strong market share in the home market will be key in the single market,&quot; said Roar Nilsen at Carnegie. &quot;That's what is driving Merita to become a financial department store.&quot;</p>
<p>Merita already has major holdings in both insurers and has its own life insurance business: it is Sampo's largest owner with about 18 percent of shares and votes. Its stake in Pohjola is 16 percent of shares and 27 percent of votes.</p>
<p>&quot;The question now is which one will Merita choose as its strategic investment,&quot; one analyst said, requesting anonymity.</p>
<p>The Finnish life insurance business is also growing fast -- Sampo expects Finnish life premium income to double to about 20 billion markka by the turn of the decade.</p>
<p>No one is ruling out a possible Nordic solution, either: some analysts said Swedish insurance giant Skandia , which already has links with Pohjola, could make Pohjola a more likely merger partner for Merita, opening a broader horizon.</p>
<p>&quot;For Merita, Pohjola would be a more likely candidate due to Skandia's involvement in it,&quot; said Nilsen.</p>
<p>&quot;The international aspect is important as well,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Skandia's stake in Pohjola is 10.9 percent of shares and 7.8 percent of votes, and Pohjola holds 10.5 percent of Skandia votes and shares.</p>
<p>Of the two insurers, Sampo's 1995 premium income at 3.7 billion markka was above Pohjola's 2.6 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>A Merita-Pohjola or Merita-Sampo merger would not offer significant synergy or cost benefits, analysts said: the only one real synergy would come from combining life-insurance.</p>
<p>For comparison, when Finnish commercial banks Suomen Yhdyspankki and Kansallispankki merged into Merita in 1995, most of the 1.5 billion markka savings consisted of personnel, real-estate and data services costs.</p>
<p>&quot;In this case the personnel cost savings would have run around some 100 million markka at the most,&quot; said Arctos' Dahlstrom.</p>
<p>Shares in all the three companies have been rising steadily since last autumn: Sampo and Pohjola recently spurted ahead after they restructured to get the value of fast-growing life-insurance operations into their stock price.</p>
<p>Since last September, Sampo has gained over 50 percent and Pohjola nearly 80 percent, with Merita putting on 82 percent. Speculation on &quot;a possible arrangement&quot; is likely to stay priced in the stocks, analysts said.</p>
