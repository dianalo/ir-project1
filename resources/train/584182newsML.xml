<p>The Brussels bourse edged higher in early trading on Wednesday, lagging its European neighbours, but traders said they saw no reason for a reversal with the market happy at current levels.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no specific reasons for it to rise or to fall from here. The dollar is up a bit and Wall Street's overnight drop was just light profittaking,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday we were fairly neutral, although there was some quite significant buying in specific shares such as PetroFina which really helped to underpin the whole market,&quot; the trader added.  </p>
<p>Traders said the market was watching for U.S. April producer price index figures due at 1230 GMT. The figures are seen unchanged month-on-month and up 1.5 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>They said that while a number of company annual meetings were due to take place during Wednesday, there were no expectations of anything specific.</p>
<p>Insurer Dexia, fast food retailer Quick and non-ferrous metals group Union Miniere are among the companies holding either annual or extraordinary general meetings today.  </p>
<p>Quick was an early victim, dropping more than six percent at one stage after the company said in a newspaper interview the first four months of 1997 had been flat.</p>
<p>By 0900 GMT it had crept back to 1,940 francs -- a loss of 4.9 percent.</p>
<p>Parent company GIB also suffered, dropping 2.6 percent to 1,520 francs.</p>
<p>On the plus side Distrigas was an early star, rising 5.4 percent to 29,500 francs in reaction to positive comments at the firm's annual meeting on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Builder Franki likewise added strongly to its recent jet propelled performance, climbing 4.0 percent to 520 francs.</p>
<p>Traders said the rise was due to fading worries among shareholders over the loss making company's fate.</p>
<p>But they noted that the volume was low and the share movements therefore exaggerated.</p>
<p>At 0920 GMT the Bel-20 blue chip share index was 0.25 percent up at 2,248.58, with some 750 million francs of Belgian shares traded.</p>
