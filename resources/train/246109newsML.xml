<title>VENEZUELA: Venezuelan jails head human rights concerns.</title>

<p>Chronic conditions in Venezuela's notoriously violent prisons, where about 18 inmates die each month, headed a list of human rights concerns presented by a local group on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A total of 220 prisoners died and 1,333 were wounded in Venezuela's jails between October 1995 and September 1996, according to the annual report of the Venezuelan Programme for Education and Action in Human Rights (PROVEA).</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in the jails continues to be serious due to high levels of overcrowding and a chronic shortage of resources,&quot; PROVEA Coordinator Raul Cubas told reporters.</p>
<p>Shrinking budgets mean the state spends an average of less than $1 per day on each of its 25,000 prisoners. &quot;This explains, in part, why they cannot count on basic resources such as uniforms, beds and bedding and that food has to be supplemented by family members,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>In October, shortly after the period covered by the PROVEA report, 25 inmates were burned alive when guards in a central Caracas jail started a fire in their cell. Justice Minister Enrique Meier described the incident at the time as, &quot;a totally arbitrary, inhumane and unforgivable act.&quot;</p>
<p>Venezuela's jails, in which three out of four inmates have not been tried and aged buildings are filled to more than twice their capacity, have been roundly criticised by human rights groups for being among the worst on the continent.</p>
<p>The PROVEA report also documented 146 cases of deaths caused directly by police or armed forces, of which 93 were unofficial executions, it said.</p>
