<headline>UK seeks new airport noise talks after May 1.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's Department of Transport (DoT) said on Thursday it was aiming to resume talks on proposed noise restrictions at three London airports as soon as possible after the May 1 election.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the DoT abandoned plans to fight a court challenge by the International Air Transport Association about new noise limits for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stanstead airports.</p>
<p>IATA had protested that the limits were tighter than those set out in international agreements aimed at phasing out old and noisy aircraft by 2002.</p>
<p>The DoT said it withdrew after it had been advised the High Court was likely to find procedural error in its consultations with IATA and other concerned parties about the monitoring.</p>
<p>&quot;The DoT will reconsult on monitoring and noise limits...The reconsultation will be as soon as practicable after May 1,&quot; a DoT official said.</p>
<p>The DoT proposed last year to cut the noise limits for daytime take-offs to 94 decibels from 97 previously and the noise limits for night-time take-offs to 87 from 89.</p>
<p>The old noise limits will continue to apply and adjustments will be made to the positioning of the noise monitoring equipment before the next round of consultations, the DoT said. It would also bear some of IATA's legal costs.</p>
