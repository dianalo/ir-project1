<headline>Tanzania troops bar refugees from camps - witnesses.</headline>
<dateline>ON THE RWANDAN-TANZANIAN BORDER 1996-12-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tanzanian troops stopped thousands of Rwandan refugees returning to their camps in northwestern Tanzania on Friday and herded them towards the border with Rwanda.</p>
<p>Reuters correspondent David Fox said troops blocked all entrances to the camps and urged refugees who wanted to sit down to keep going towards Rwanda. Soldiers waved sticks around but did not hit them.  </p>
<p>&quot;They are definitely not being allowed back into their camps. They are in a thin trickle but the soldiers are urging them on towards the border,&quot; said Fox, adding the head of the column was about five km (three miles) short of the frontier.</p>
<p>He said one group of refugees said they wanted to stay in their camps but had been told to keep going towards Rwanda.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of refugees turned around and headed back towards their camps near the border earlier on Friday after Tanzanian troops and police set up roadblocks and urged them to go back.</p>
