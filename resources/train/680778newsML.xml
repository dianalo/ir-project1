<p>The Indian government is likely to issue a medium-term bond to mop up liquidity and take advantage of lower interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;They may possibly issue a six-year paper,&quot; said the head of money markets at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>He said there was a dearth of bonds maturing in 2003.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend seems to be to pick up as much money as possible in a low-interest scenario,&quot; said Roopesh Pathania, a money market dealer at Barclays Bank in Bombay.</p>
<p>The government has already completed over 40 percent of its borrowing target for 1997/98 (April-March), taking advantage of easy liquidity and a falling interest rate regime.</p>
<p>&quot;There is lot of unsatiated demand in the market,&quot; said R. Narayan, assistant manager (treasury) at Bank of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The premium on the 12.59 percent 2004 bond issued on June 17 was proof of the market's appetite, he said.</p>
<p>It received applications for over 50 billion rupees against a target of 20 billion rupees.</p>
<p>This bond was quoted at 101.40 rupees on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the next bond could be of six year maturity as there were several papers maturing in both 2002 and 2004.</p>
<p>The abundant liquidity will be manifest in oversubscriptions at bond issues, dealers said.</p>
