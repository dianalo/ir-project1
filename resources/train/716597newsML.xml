<headline>Behind surface Senate civility, a ruthless process.</headline>

<p>As Richard Sullivan learned Wednesday, beneath the courtly manners that govern the Senate hearings into campaign finance abuses lies a process that is often ruthless.</p>
<p>Sullivan, finance director of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during last year's election, was grilled for four hours as the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee sought to ferret out evidence of improper fund raising.</p>
<p>The contest pitted a man in his mid-30's against 16 senators, some of them nearly twice his age.</p>
<p>Virtually all the senators began by politely thanking Sullivan, the first witness called before the committee, for agreeing to testify and several praised his candor. But that did not stop them from slipping in the knife later.</p>
<p>Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican elected to the Senate 25 years ago, opened his questioning by asking solicitously, &quot;Are you feeling alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm fine,&quot; replied the startled witness.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm feeling great too,&quot; said Domenici, who then subjected Sullivan to a withering line of questions on whether a series of coffees held at the White House were fund raisers.</p>
<p>Sullivan, like the White House, maintained that the events attended by President Bill Clinton were not fund raisers despite documents that refer to $400,000 fund-raising targets that were set and generally reached.</p>
<p>His defence, like that of the White House, rests on the argument that there was no price tag for attendance at the coffees and that no one was ever asked for a donation at them, although they were often solicited afterwards.</p>
<p>Domenici was having none of it. &quot;For the first time since you've been here, I really believe you are spewing words calculated to confuse the issue,&quot; the senator snapped.</p>
<p>Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, was equally rough as he asked Sullivan how Wang Jun, an executive with a Chinese state-controlled company whose businesses include arms manufacturing, came to attend one of the White House coffees.</p>
<p>Wang came to the White House coffee on Feb. 6, 1996. On the same day, according to documents released by the committee, the wife of Ernest Green, an official with investment bank Lehman Brothers who was hosting Wang in Washington, wrote the DNC a $50,000 check.</p>
<p>Sullivan said he believed the DNC had done a computer database search on Wang, a Chinese citizen, and had not turned up any information that suggested he should not attend.</p>
<p>&quot;The public record is clear that Wang Jun has ties at a very high level to Chinese officials and that he's the head of a major arms dealer,&quot; Specter shot back, arguing that any database search would have picked this up.</p>
<p>Sullivan, shifting in his seat and his voice breaking slightly, replied: &quot;It's obviously a mistake. It was something that as I understood it was important to Ernie, who had this guy in town doing business. Ernie has been a long-term supporter and it was purely as a favour to Ernie.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the session, some of the senators, as well as their staff, showed some sympathy for Sullivan.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a highly pressured format for a fellow like that,&quot; Mike Madigan, counsel for the committee's Republican majority, told reporters after the hearing. &quot;Mr. Sullivan is in a very difficult position ... He is at a young age and I think he is trying the best he can to answer the questions.&quot;</p>
