<p>More than a million people were left homeless or otherwise affected by a cyclone in Bangladesh in which hundreds of people are reported to have died, relief officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The current death toll of 112 might rise, with some 1,500 fishermen still missing in the Bay of Bengal, the officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of them may not return eventually,&quot; one official in Cox's Bazar said.</p>
<p>Officials on Tuesday night said nearly 400,000 houses had been damaged and 15,000 cattle killed. More than 1.5 million people were made homeless or otherwise affected, they said.</p>
<p>One official said: &quot;We are making a full assessment of the losses, which may take a week or more. But so far it looks like that the extent (of damage) is within a manageable limit.</p>
<p>&quot;However, many areas remain out of reach and may have suffered wider damage,&quot; said the official supervising relief operations in southeastern areas of the country that bore the brunt of the storm.</p>
<p>He said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday would fly to devastated areas that she could not reach in her first trip on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bangladesh's worst cyclone in 1991 killed at least 138,000 people and left at least one million homeless.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not appealing for international help but of course will welcome (it) if anyone offers to assist,&quot; Hasina said on Tuesday. She urged Bangladeshis to donate generously to a relief fund.</p>
<p>Newspapers said the cyclone, roaring in from the Bay of Bengal, had killed between 350 and 500 and at least 5,000 people were injured.</p>
<p>The official figure for injuries was &quot;thousands,&quot; the Cyclone Preparedness Centre in Chittagong port city said.</p>
<p>This low-lying South Asian nation, put on a virtual war footing after the cyclone hit, has launched a huge rescue and relief operation in areas devastated on Monday.</p>
<p>Army, naval and police units joined thousands of volunteers fanning out across the coastal regions.</p>
<p>The cyclone ravaged Chittagong, the Cox's Bazar and Tenkaf districts and several islands on Monday with winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph).</p>
