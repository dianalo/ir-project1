<p>Istanbul shares lost almost all of Thursday's gains in selling on Friday amid caution caused by ongoing political concerns ahead of the weekend, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed at 1,431, down 38 points, or 2.59 percent from Thursday when it leapt 2.94 percent on easing political tension. But it rebounded from a late low of 1,422.</p>
<p>The index had dived 6.85 percent in the five days since the market opened last Thursday following a 6-1/2 day holiday.</p>
<p>Daily volume dropped to 10.67 trillion lira ($78.8 million) from 11.59 trillion ($85.5 million) on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday's sudden jump was an artificial move prompted by Ciller's remarks which caused political tension to ease. But the market is does not actually have the strength (volume) for an upward move,&quot; said Soner Canoglu from Yasar securities.</p>
<p>The ruling Islamist Welfare Party (RP) won breathing space after deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said on Thursday her conservative True Path Party (DYP) would not abandon its coalition partners despite a row with the military over the rise of Islamist activity.</p>
<p>Brokers expect firm support at the index's 1,420 level to hold.</p>
<p>&quot;Shares will continue to move in narrow price ranges until there is a major increase in trade volume. The easing in political tension is not sufficient,&quot; said Haydar Haydaroglu from Halkbank.</p>
<p>He said the market would also watch April inflation data to be released on Sunday and a possible Treasury bond auction for May 7 when the Treasury faces a 130 trillion lira bond redemption.</p>
