<p>A Pakistani paramilitary ranger was killed and a civilian woman badly wounded in a clash between Indian and Pakistani troops near the city of Sialkot, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of Islamabad, a military source said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The shooting, which began on Friday, occurred one day after India and Pakistan agreed that their top foreign ministry officials should meet in New Delhi on March 28-31 to resume peace talks that broke down over Kashmir in early 1994.</p>
<p>The source said Indian troops had opened fire across the so-called working border between Pakistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir at 10.30 a.m. (0530 GMT) on Friday.</p>
<p>One member of the Chenab Rangers was killed and a woman was seriously wounded. Several other civilians were wounded in the shooting, he added.</p>
<p>Pakistani soldiers retaliated, but the source said he could not say if they had inflicted any casualties on the Indian side.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakistani rangers are firing in self-defence. It is the Indians who are carrying out unprovoked firing. They want to spread it,&quot; said the source, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>He said clashes, involving automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, were still going on in the Charwa, Jhammat, Pookhlian and Shakargarh sectors of the border.</p>
<p>In the northern Indian city of Jammu, authorities said there had been exchanges of gunfire for several weeks but they could not confirm the reported killing on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Firing has been going on for the last several weeks along the international border near R.S. Pora village, Suchetgarh and Samba sectors,&quot; an official with the paramilitary Border Security Force told Reuters. &quot;But we don't know what happened on the other side of the border.&quot;</p>
<p>The working border between Indian and Pakistan stretches 174 km (109 miles) between the Chenab and Ravi rivers to join up in the north with the Line of Control, or ceasefire line, dividing Kashmir.</p>
<p>Indian and Pakistani troops frequently exchange fire across the Line of Control and the working border.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, of which India controls two-thirds and Pakistan the rest.</p>
