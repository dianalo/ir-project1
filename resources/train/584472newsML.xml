<p>A huge World War Two bomb found near Phnom Penh was detonated on Wednesday, a potent reminder of the task Cambodia faces in clearing its soil of deadly debris accumulated during years of warfare.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very surprised to see this type of bomb because we did not know there was bombing here in World War Two... The moment we found the tail fin we knew it was an old model,&quot; Major Philip Pille from Belgium told Reuters at the bomb site.</p>
<p>The 2,000-lb, 6-ft bomb was found last week by brickmakers digging into a waterlogged pool of blue clay. They struck something hard and, thinking it was a rock, hit what turned out to be the metal hide of the bomb with their hoes.</p>
<p>Luckily, the bomb, containing almost 600 kg of TNT, did not go off.</p>
<p>A tip from a local journalist brought teams from the Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC) to the clay pit, run by a brickmaking factory on the outskirts of the capital.</p>
<p>The bomb was destroyed with a 4-kg charge of plastic explosive, leaving a crater six metres deep and 15 metres wide.</p>
<p>Heng Vannara, an explosives demolition officer with CMAC, said it was the biggest bomb ever seen in Cambodia and the first one found dating back to World War Two.</p>
<p>Military historians think the bomb was dropped in 1943 by a United States Air Force B-29 on a bombing raid against Japanese shipping in the Tonle Sap River, which lies near the bomb site.</p>
<p>Cambodia was occupied at the time by Japanese Imperial Army troops but the Vichy French government, a collaborator with Hitler's Nazi Germany, ran the day-to-day administration. The country was a protectorate of France from 1863 to 1953.</p>
<p>Captain Walter Fiers, a Dutch technical adviser to CMAC, estimated that after almost 30 years of strife Cambodia was littered with unexploded bombs, bomblets and artillery shells, many dating back to U.S. bombing raids from 1969-73.</p>
<p>More bombs were dropped in eastern and central Cambodia during the Vietnam War than in Europe during World War Two, and Fiers said at least 10 percent failed to explode while up to 30 percent of the bomblets did not detonate.</p>
<p>He said there were no records of minefields but &quot;in the experience we have in the field, we now say (there are) between four and six million. Most of these mines date from the 1979-91 civil war and models have been found from more than a dozen countries&quot;.</p>
<p>The deadly legacy of these weapons is visible all over Cambodia, where some 40,000 people have lost limbs to mines and unexploded ordnance, giving the nation one of the highest ratios of amputees per head of population in the world. More than 100 civilians are killed or maimed each month.</p>
<p>CMAC and a handful of foreign mine clearance agencies have been slowly cleaning up the country since the warring factions signed a U.N.-brokered peace pact in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearance is something that will go on for 200 years,&quot; said Fiers, adding that the problem could be controlled within 15 years by mapping and fencing off affected areas.</p>
