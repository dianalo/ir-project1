<p>President Bill Clinton on Tuesday ordered 3,500 U.S. troops to Kuwait as part of a plan to &quot;keep Saddam Hussein in a box,&quot; but failed to silence Republican criticism of his effort to deter Iraq.</p>
<p>Clinton, trying to manage a tricky foreign policy challenge in the midst of the presidential election campaign, briefed congressional leaders on his Gulf strategy before starting a four-day political trip to the Midwest and West.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary William Perry, just back from a trip to the Middle East to rally support for the president's plan, also took part in the 90-minute briefing, as did Secretary of State Warren Christopher and General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff.</p>
<p>Speaking with reporters afterwards, Clinton disputed a Washington Post report that he was having second thoughts about reinforcing U.S. ground forces in Kuwait because a showdown with Saddam, Iraq's president, was easing.</p>
<p>&quot;I authorized the deployment last weekend and ... the deployment orders were signed last night,&quot; Clinton said in denying that plans to send the troops had been put on hold.</p>
<p>&quot;I was surprised when I read the story today (about possible suspension of the troop deployment) and I asked for an explanation of it and none of our people had one because I asked for the deployment last weekend and, as I said, the orders were signed last night,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>He did not say when the troops might actually go.</p>
<p>They would join 1,500 U.S. soldiers already in Kuwait, one of the world's largest oil exporters. It was  overrun by Iraqi troops in 1990, an invasion triggered the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, an official said the deployment would occur in a matter of days. &quot;The order has been received, and it will be 3,500 troops. I expect they will go in the coming days&quot;, said the official, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The Pentagon announced last Friday that 5,000 armored troops from the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, would go to Kuwait, but the movement was held up until Kuwait gave permission for them to be sent.</p>
<p>The defense official said that the deployment had been reduced from  5,000 to 3,500 because &quot;we decided that is the number we needed.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton defended his ordering of cruise missile strikes against air defense facilities in southern Iraq two weeks ago in retaliation for an Iraqi move against Kurds in the north.</p>
<p>He said the attacks -- and the accompanying expansion of a no-fly zone in southern Iraq from which Iraqi warplanes are excluded -- were designed to improve the U.S. strategic position in the Gulf and &quot;keep Saddam Hussein in a box and limit his ability to threaten his neighbors.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton said that hitting Iraqi Republican Guard troops in northern Iraq, as some of his critics have urged, would have been inappropriate, since they were allied with one of the factions involved in Kurdish infighting.</p>
<p>Referring indirectly to the possibility that such a move might have resulted in American casualties, Clinton said the course his critics proposed would have &quot;a very high price.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We did the appropriate thing in the appropriate way and we've gotten the results that we sought,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>But Sen. John McCain, a former Navy flier who spent more than six years in a North Vietnamese prisoner of war camp during the Vietnam War, rejected Clinton's argument.</p>
<p>&quot;Saddam Hussein is far better off than he was two weeks ago. He now controls parts of northern Iraq he didn't (control) since 1991, and he has either split or revealed significant splits withiin the (Gulf War) coalition , which can do nothing but help him in the long run,&quot; said McCain, an Arizona Republican.</p>
<p>Senate Republican leader Trent Lott was also critical. &quot;I think there has been some neglect and ambiguity here over the past few weeks and months and that's not the way you can deal with a dictator in Iraq,&quot; said Lott, from Mississippi.</p>
<p>Despite the beefing up of U.S. ground forces in Kuwait, a senior White House official said Iraq's response to a set of U.S. demands made through diplomatic channels last week was &quot;encouraging,&quot; and that chances of new U.S. military action were diminishing.</p>
<p>But Senator Joseph Lieberman, among a group of lawmakers briefed by Clinton and his top aides on Tuesday, said Clinton was quite explicit that if Iraq defies the U.S. demands &quot;they can expect to be hit again and hit disproportionately.&quot;</p>
