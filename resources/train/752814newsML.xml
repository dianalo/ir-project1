<p>Portuguese-ruled Macau on Thursday passed a tough law to fight Chinese gangsters and to crack down on a wave of violent crime, assassinations and fire bombing that has rocked the territory in recent months.</p>
<p>Macau's legislature overwhelmingly endorsed the law, which is directed against triads, or secret criminal societies, that comes into effect early next month.</p>
<p>The 42-article bill is modelled on Italy's anti-Mafia laws and imposes prison terms of up to 15 years for leaders of triads. Tougher prison sentences would be meted out to gang leaders, or &quot;dragonheads&quot;, for recruiting members under the age of 18.</p>
<p>The bill also imposes a ban on the entry to the enclave of convicted foreign triad members.</p>
<p>It offers special protection to detectives infiltrating triads or to gangsters giving evidence against kingpins.</p>
<p>But one pro-democracy legislator, Ng Kuok-cheong, expressed concern that human rights protection would be eroded under the new law, which makes it an offence to disturb people's &quot;well being or feeling of security&quot;. He said the government should narrow the definition.</p>
<p>Triads, some of them well-organised, operate in Hong Kong, Macau and southern China, and their tentacles stretch to Chinatowns in a number of Western countries. Macau gangsters often escape into China after carrying out attacks.</p>
<p>They are linked to a wide range of illegal activities ranging from drugs trafficking, smuggling and prostitution to protection rackets, which the new anti-triad law has listed as types of crimes specific to triads.</p>
<p>In Macau, which earns most of its foreign currency from gambling-related tourism, the triads run protection rackets preying on the casino business.</p>
<p>Gang warfare has been blamed for a recent wave of bombings, arson attacks and drive-by shootings in which some 16 people have been killed so far this year.</p>
<p>The number of tourists visiting Macau fell 2.4 percent to 3.2 million in the first five months this year versus the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>Police sources say two gangs -- the 14K and Soi Fong -- are believed to have forged a truce in May after realising that gangland-style killings were bad for business.</p>
<p>Macau, under Portuguese rule for four-and-a-half centuries, reverts to Chinese rule in 1999.</p>
<p>Beijing has urged the Portuguese authorities to crack down on organised crime before the handover, and Macau and Chinese police have been liaising on the problem.</p>
