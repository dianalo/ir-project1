<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - AUG 13----------------</p>
<p>Robusta coffee futures were expected to resume their downward trend on Wednesday after selling waves dragged both the London and New York markets sharply lower, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The London market was called to open between $20 and $30 lower than Tuesday's close.  </p>
<p>London's September contract dived through psychological support at $1,600 a tonne and was expected to remain weak as long as the nearby September/November spread was at a discount, traders said.</p>
<p>Initial support was pegged at last month's reaction low of $1,477. But if that failed September was likely to target the lower end of a chart gap at $1,368.</p>
<p>&quot;Coffee looks fairly weak now,&quot; said Elli Gifford, an independent technical analyst.</p>
<p>Bearish fundamentals had also weighed on sentiment as concerns eased about supply tightness.</p>
<p>Many industry sources expected the Green Coffee Association to show an build in green coffee stowed in U.S. warehouses during July.</p>
<p>Most early estimates looked for an increase over June levels of 50,000 to 100,000 60-kg bags.</p>
