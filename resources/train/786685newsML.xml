<headline>TAIWAN JULY TRADE SURPLUS DOWN 59.6 PCT YR/YR.</headline>

<p>Taiwan had a trade surplus of US$543 million in July, down 59.6 percent compared to a US$1.345 billion surplus in July 1996, the finance ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In Taiwan dollar terms, the July surplus was T$14.09 billion, down 61.2 percent from a T$36.28 billion surplus in July 1996, the ministry said. The difference in trade balances mainly reflected a recent local currency depreciation.  </p>
<p>In U.S. dollar terms, July exports totalled US$10.7 billion, up 13.1 percent compared with July 1996.</p>
<p>Imports were US$10.16 billion, up an annual 25.1 percent.</p>
<p>In Taiwan dollar terms, exports in July rose 14.1 percent to T$297.93 billion from July 1996, with imports gaining 26.3 percent to T$283.84 billion.</p>
<p>The July surplus decline was somewhat greater than the average forecast of a Reuters Poll of Taiwan economists. That August 5 poll projected a US$686 million surplus, which would have represented a 49 percent year-on-year decline.  </p>
<p>The United States led the July list as Taiwan's top market, absorbing 24.5 percent or US$2.62 billion of total exports.</p>
<p>Hong Kong came in second with $2.54 billion or 23.7 percent of the total -- an indication of rival communist China's growing importance to rival Taiwan's economy. Much of Hong Kong's imports actually are destined for China, which reclaimed sovereignty over the territory from Britain on July 1.</p>
<p>Nationalist-ruled Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a renegade province since a 1949 civil war split, has allowed indirect trade with China since a late 1980s political thaw. Virtually all Taiwan-China trade is routed through Hong Kong.  </p>
<p>Taipei has said it would allow businesses to continue to use Hong Kong as a trade conduit despite its reabsorption by Beijing, which has no official contacts with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Exports to Europe accounted for 12.4 percent of Taiwan's total exports at $1.33 billion.</p>
<p>Japan remained Taiwan's top import source, accounting for US$2.64 billion or 26 percent of the total, followed by the United States at $2.17 billion (21.4 percent) and Europe at $1.94 billion (19.1 percent).</p>
<p>Hsu Kuo-chung, the ministry's chief statistician, said he expected Taiwan's exports to grow a year-on-year eight percent in the second half and imports to grow some 10 percent.  </p>
<p>Economists have said the Taiwan dollar's sharp late July depreciation would help Taiwan's export competitiveness, though it could slow imports.</p>
<p>Taiwan's July trade surplus with the United States decreased 47.4 percent to $450 million compared to July 1996.</p>
<p>Its trade surplus with Hong Kong was $2.38 billion, up 21.1 percent from July 1996.</p>
<p>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan grew a year-on-year 20.3 percent to $1.51 billion, while deficit with Europe jumped 179.4 percent to $610 million.  </p>
