<headline>THE PROTEUS COLUMN - SPACE IN VENICE.</headline>
<text>
<p>THE PROTEUS COLUMN</p>
<p>Space insurers meeting for the Generali biennial conference in Venice today gather under different circumstances from its first meeting in 1979.</p>
<p>Then, the space sector was dominated by the Cold War, spurring the USA and Soviet Union to devise programmes entailing huge economic commitments. Now, the space market has opened up, the military element has retrenched, and civilian uses affect many aspects of everyday life.</p>
<p>Those 18 years have also been important for space insurers. There have been more than 250 insured launches, with many successes and a few failures, and a level of know-how has been attained.</p>
<p>No surprise then that those who have done the legwork resent the influx of new, well-capitalised players who are trying, in many cases successfully, to muscle in on the dividends.</p>
<p>Some feel that, in terms of a profit and loss balance, space insurance has just passed the break-even point. However, the industry is vulnerable because of the high value of individual risks, as the disastrous experience of 1994 reminded the market.</p>
<p>And, although experience grows, new risks and threats continue to appear. Today, Venice delegates were warned about direct and third party risks being generated by the growing problem of man-made space junk.</p>
<p>Other problems include solar radiations, which can interfere with the activity of satellites and have been known to black them out altogether. Manufacturers are beginning to take these radiations into account, but for insurers the risk is higher because a single solar storm could cause damage to several satellites at a time.</p>
<p>Meteor storms predicted by scientists over the next two years could pose a similar risk.</p>
<p>Space insurance premiums earned since 1984 are estimated by Generali at $4.8 billion, while the total insured value of satellites currently orbiting the Earth is $16 billion.</p>
<p>Established space insurers warn that new players don't understand the business, and that if they offer attractive rates and then get stung by a bad season, the market will suddenly shrink. But this is the way with all insurance markets.</p>
<p>It is up to insurers to say things like this to persuade brokers that their clients are better placing their risks with established names. It is up to the brokers to try to respond, and not be tempted to go for the lower price in order to keep a short term smile on the client's face.</p>
<p>This way the insurance cycle is kept under control. But surely, if it was so easy, everyone would do it.</p>
