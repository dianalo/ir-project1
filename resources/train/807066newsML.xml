<text>
<p>Denmark's Maersk Air on Monday rejected overtures for closer cooperation from the newly announced strategic alliance between Norwegian airline Braathens SAFE and KLM Royal Dutch Airline .</p>
<p>&quot;I still think that it is the best thing for Maersk Air to be independent, to have many allies and not be tied to one partner,&quot; Maersk Air managing director Bjarne Hansen told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;If you tie yourself down in one strategic alliance, you prevent cooperation with other companies and we are not interested in that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier Braathens SAFE and KLM announced that they planned to form a strategic alliance and offered closer cooperation with Finland's Finnair and Maersk.</p>
<p>Maersk Air, owned by the Danish A.P. Moeller shipping and energy group, launched eight-times daily flights between Stockholm and Copenhagen last April in cooperation with Finnair in a challenge to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).</p>
<p>The deregulation of air traffic has meant increased pressure on SAS on its home territory in Scandinavia from outside as well as regional airlines.</p>
