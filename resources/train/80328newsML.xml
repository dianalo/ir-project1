<title>SPAIN: Spain close to 97 budget deal with Catalan allies.</title>
<headline>Spain close to 97 budget deal with Catalan allies.</headline>

<p>The Spanish government and its Catalan allies said they were &quot;very close&quot; to sealing a deal on the hotly debated 1997 budget on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar announced the cabinet would approve the draft on Friday.</p>
<p>The last sticking point keeping the Catalan Convergence and Unity (CiU) from granting the votes of their 16 seats for the minority Popular Party (PP) government's first budget was being resolved at a meeting late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A CiU spokesman said the PP agreed to finance disputed health care funding, which is being transferred to the autonomous regions, through money saved by putting a wage freeze on 1997 public sector salaries.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very close,&quot; the spokesman told journalists.</p>
<p>The two parties were still waiting to put the final touches on the deal before signing off.</p>
<p>The PP depends on support from the Catalan nationalists and the four votes of the Canary Islands coalition to get an absolute majority in Congress, where it has 156 seats and needs at least 175 votes.</p>
<p>The Canary Islands group gave a guarantee of its support earlier on Wednesday in exchange for more investment funding being directed toward the islands.</p>
<p>The Catalans had pledged to support a stringent 1997 budget to whip Spain's finances into shape for the launch of the European single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>But the nationalists held up budget talks as they fought to squeeze the best deal for the wealthy, northeastern region out of the conservatives.</p>
