<p>The Russian economy continued to stabilise in March but problems remain, official figures released Monday showed.</p>
<p>&quot;The great decline in the Russian economy over the last decade has practically stopped,&quot; Yuri Yurkov, chairman of the State Statistics Committee, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Russian gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in the first quarter from a year ago and consumer price inflation in March slowed to a post-reform low of 16.7 percent, the figures showed.</p>
<p>Officials point to such figures as evidence of a turnaround in the Russian economy, which has shrunk every year since 1989.</p>
<p>Yurkov said the figures should not be interpreted as showing economic growth, but said they indicated the economy was no longer contracting.</p>
<p>But the picture may not be as rosy as it seems. GDP actually fell 0.3 percent in March from a year ago and other problems persist.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent in March according to official figures and actual unemployment is widely considered to be even higher.</p>
