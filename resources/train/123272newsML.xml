<p>&quot;It is the third day the central bank has been demonstrating it is sure of keeping the rouble rate,&quot; Inkombank chief dealer Vladimir Kudryavtsev said.</p>
<p>&quot;Those banks who are still on the market are coming to the conlusion dollar buying is not attractive,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Roubles for today settlement were quoted at 5,437-40 per dollar, the same as in early trading and late on Wednesday. Tomorrow roubles edged down to 5,438-41 per dollar from yesterday's late 5,437-40.</p>
