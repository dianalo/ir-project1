<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-06-20</dateline>

<p>Hungarian traders were divided on price direction on the Budapest Stock Exchange which celebrates its seventh birthday on Saturday.</p>
<p>One trader expected a slowdown despite Thursday's rally on Wall Street, saying he regarded Thursday's falls on the Hungarian market as warnings signs.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite that (the Dow's rise) I think we'll weaken a little bit,&quot; said Gyorgy Czipo of ING Barings. &quot;On Thursday almost all leading stocks fell, this is a warning sign,&quot; he added. &quot;Nevertheless, a fall would definitely do good for the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hungarian share market's BUX index has risen more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year and reached its latest all time high of 6,480.41 points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Another trader was more optimistic and said the market should rise on anticipated further gains in oil and gas company MOL shares.</p>
<p>Tamas Revesz of Wintrust expected MOL to be in focus and anticipated strong demand for the stocks as investors might boost their holdings in MOL ahead of Hungary's decision on the size of gas sale price increase.</p>
<p>&quot;Unsatisfied demand in MOL will boost its price further, even up to 4,000 forints,&quot; Revesz said.</p>
<p>Hungary's government spokesman said on Thursday a decision on the size of the gas price increase has to be published in the official gazette by Tuesday as latest.</p>
<p>On Thursday the BUX index finished at 6,480.41 points, down 29.73.</p>
