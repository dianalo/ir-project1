<p>British firms are investing rapidly in emerging markets and currently rate China as the most attractive, India as having the greatest potential and Nigeria at the bottom, according to a study published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Seventy-six percent of British companies with international operations are currently investing in emerging economies, with Asia seen as offering the best rewards,&quot; business and political consultancy, Control Risks, said.  </p>
<p>The survey, which covered 100 of Britain's top 500 companies, showed that only 12 percent of respondents were not even considering investing in emerging economies.</p>
<p>China's size and population put it on top of the most favoured destinations list, but businessmen warn that concerns are emerging over who will succeed Elder Statesman Deng Xiaoping and how this will affect the timing of China meeting the high expectations of international business.  </p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, the inadequacy of the legal system and corruption will continue to frustrate investors,&quot; Control Risks said.</p>
<p>India's progress to an open market economy -- started in the early 1990s by the Congress government -- is unlikely to be reversed despite the slow pace of some reforms, investors say.</p>
<p>The survey showed that British businessmen are most worried by the lack of political stability and security in emerging economies, while environmental issues and a democratic framework are at the bottom of the list of their concerns.  </p>
<p>&quot;Uncertainty in government can slow down decision-making processes, disrupt policy formulation and prompt bureaucratic inertia,&quot; Control Risks commented.</p>
<p>Control Risks believes that investors have overestimated the security threat to foreign nationals and projects. Physical security in hostile environments can be managed, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, many oil and gas companies operate successfully in Algeria, despite the often savage Islamic extremist insurgency there,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>Issues such as the environment, human rights and labour conditions, however, have been underestimated, it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;If a company is falling down in any of these areas anywhere in the world, then the global repercussions -- such as consumer boycotts and insurance withdrawals -- can be vast,&quot; Control Risks said.</p>
<p>Among the central and east European countries which emerged from the shadow of communism in the early 1990s, the Czech Republic tops the region and ranks sixth overall in the survey, while Poland is ranked nine.</p>
<p>However, the world's largest landmass and potentially its largest emerging market, Russia, was ranked at number 20.</p>
<p>&quot;Even given Russia's well documented problems of well-organised crime, inadequate legislation and political instability, this is a low ranking for a country whose potential is so vast,&quot; Control Risks said.</p>
