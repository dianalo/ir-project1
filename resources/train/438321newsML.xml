<p>Financial Secretary Donald Tsang reported coffers brimming with cash when he presented Hong Kong's last budget before reunion with China, but he resisted temptations for a spending spree.</p>
<p>Tsang, Hong Kong's first locally-born Chinese fiscal chief, chose to follow Hong Kong's tradition of conservative fiscal policy and respect the invisible hand of the market.</p>
<p>Mindful of the historic significance of the occasion, Tsang told Hong Kong and the international community that capitalism, not communism, would prevail when Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region of China on July 1.</p>
<p>His speech, titled &quot;Continuity in a Time of Change&quot;, was widely tipped to be conservative in light of the huge changes confronting the community of 6.4 million people.</p>
<p>More than 150 years of colonial rule end when Hong Kong, reverts to China at midnight on June 30, a date now 111 days away.</p>
<p>Tsang said Hong Kong, where annual per capita gross domestic product of US$24,500 exceeds that of Britain, would begin its new era under China with HK$330 billion (US$42.7 billion) in reserves in the bank.</p>
<p>Despite reporting a HK$15.1 billion budget surplus and forecasting more to come, Tsang merely tinkered with tax bands and allowances, disappointing many who had banked on swingeing tax cuts.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's salaries tax rate remains at 15 percent and the corporate rate at 16.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really left me speechless. I'm still bemused at the boldness of his ability to stand up and tell us he's going to accumulate HK$90 billion in surplus over the next four years,&quot; said Marshall Byres, chairman of tax services at Ernst &amp; Young in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The budget, Tsang told the Legislative Council, was unique and designed &quot;specially to meet the circumstances of 1997&quot;.</p>
<p>He called it a model of cooperation with China but served warning that Hong Kong would march to its own financial drum beat after the handover.</p>
<p>&quot;As it is a transitional budget, the British and Chinese sides needed to go through a process of consultation in order to achieve a unified budget for the whole financial year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tsang, who will continue to serve as the financial chief under Hong Kong's post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa, said all future budgets would be handled by Hong Kong alone.</p>
<p>&quot;(China) had made clear that after June 30 the preparation of the annual budget will be a matter entirely for the Special Administrative Region.&quot;</p>
<p>He also served notice that democratic freedoms remained the cornerstone of Hong Kong's prosperity.</p>
<p>Tsang had earlier spoken out against China's plans to roll back some of Hong Kong's human rights laws after the handover, igniting speculation that his days in government service may be numbered. But he hammered home the message again.</p>
<p>&quot;The free flow of information is the lifeblood of a modern service economy,&quot; Tsang said. &quot;It leads to transparency and accountability in both the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the best protection against corruption and abuse of power not only by government but in the business world as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Tsang called the rule of law, the &quot;level playing field&quot;, a corruption-free government, and the free flow of information the &quot;four pillars of wisdom&quot; guiding Hong Kong into the 21st century.</p>
