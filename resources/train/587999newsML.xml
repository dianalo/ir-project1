<p>Britain's Mercury Asset Management Group Plc, posting a rise in year profits, said on Thursday its past growth in earnings may not be sustainable in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Our revenues vary with the levels of the stock and bond markets in which our clients' funds are invested, and more than ever it is impossible to predict the outcome for the coming year,&quot; the firm said in its earnings statement.  </p>
<p>Mercury's pretax profit before exceptional items rose to 171.3 million pounds ($281.4 million) for the year ended on March 31 from some 140.5 million pounds in the previous period.</p>
<p>In the 10 years since its flotation, Mercury's funds under management had increased to 89.7 billion pounds, representing a compound annual growth rate of 15.4 percent, the firm said.</p>
<p>Earnings per share had risen at a compound rate of 20.6 percent to an adjusted 63.8 pence.</p>
<p>&quot;Shareholders cannot necessarily expect these rates of growth to be sustainable in the future,&quot; the firm said, adding that the past 10 years had seen an extremely favourable climate for portfolio investment.</p>
<p>Mercury said it did not believe it was in its holders' interests to reduce its capital through a repayment to shareholders.</p>
<p>However, the company said it expected to maintain a relatively high level of distribution through its dividend.</p>
<p>Mercury raised its total dividend for the year to 45.0 pence per ordinary share from 35.0 pence. ($ = 0.608 British Pounds)</p>
