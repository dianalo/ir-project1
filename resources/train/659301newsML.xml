<p>Iran said on Friday international regulations were inadequate to protect the telecommunications services of developing nations from being overwhelmed by major multinational corporations.</p>
<p>&quot;Adequate ways and means are not in the hands of many countries to benefit from what the competitive market should provide for them,&quot; Communications Minister Mohammed Gharazi said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also possible that in the long run, a new type of monopoly shall be imposed by the multinational enterprises,&quot; he told delegates at the Asia Telecom 97 trade fair.  </p>
<p>Gharazi said developing economies lacked the resources to compete with the telecommunications giants and had limited influence with the International Telecommunucation Union (ITU), the principal body formulating telecoms liberalisation rules.</p>
<p>&quot;The limited participation of developing countries in the activities of the ITU in respect to formulation of international rates and standards could help the development of the aforesaid new monopolies,&quot; Gharazi said.</p>
<p>He said developing countries should play a greater role in ITU affairs to ensure fair competition and put emphasis on the social and cultural shifts the Information Age would bring.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are not yet ready to cope with all of the social and cultural implications brought about by the evolution of the information society,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Efforts would have to be made to prevent &quot;media fraud and unjust accusations as well as the generation of anti-moral social characters&quot;, Gharazi said.</p>
<p>He called on the ITU to set up a special unit to &quot;address all issues pertaining to the preservation of good human characters and values through the proper use of telecommunications&quot;.  </p>
<p>Gharazi said Asia had the power to make the world take notice of its needs.</p>
<p>&quot;Asia, as the largest continent in the world in terms of area and population ... in co-ordination and co-operation with the ITU, can make the necessary arrangements to prevent whatever remains of the said positive and humane characters from changing phase to some other characteristics such as cruelty, corruption and oppression,&quot; Gharazi said.</p>
