<p>Faced with few other options for economic growth, impoverished Laos plans to vigorously exploit its rich natural resources in 1997, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are putting hydropower as a high priority,&quot; said Leuan Somboukhanh, vice-chairman of the State Planning Committee. &quot;It is the main sector that can generate...income for our government and for our people,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He predicted that Laos' healthy economic growth -- 7.1 percent in fiscal year 1996 -- would continue to be driven mainly by the hydroelectric sector, with as many as 18 dams on the drawing board for the small, land-locked communist nation.</p>
<p>Although rich in natural resources, Laos' per capita gross domestic product (GDP) stands at just $350 per year.</p>
<p>The country's 4.5 million people remain heavily dependent on foreign aid, which averages from $200 million to $300 million per year, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
<p>While hydropower and forest products are the country's leading exports, the UNDP says farming remains the principal livelihood for most Laotians.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of Laotians are farmers who grow just enough to feed their own families, and floods last year are expected to create a rice deficit of 154,000 tonnes, according to the World Food Programme.</p>
<p>On a brighter note for the Laotian economy, however, inflation dropped in fiscal year 1996 to about 12 percent, down from 25.7 percent in 1995, according to government and UNDP data.</p>
<p>But the kip, Laos' currency, has weakened.</p>
<p>It is now trading at about 980 to the U.S. dollar, compared to 920 last year. Economic analysts blame inflation and the country's three-currency market regime for its fall.</p>
<p>The Thai baht, U.S. dollar and kip are used interchangeably in Laos.</p>
<p>The ruling Lao People's Revolutionary Party has been slowly implementing economic reforms since aid from Moscow began to dry up in the 1980s. Among other measures, Laos enacted a revamped investment law in 1993 which an international economist said is among the most progressive in the region.</p>
<p>Privatisation of state-owned companies has moved ahead and a $44 million construction project is underway at Vientiane's international airport.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic reform is very gradual. The government is worried about it, but it is a necessity borne out of the collapse of the Soviet system,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>The UNDP expects construction and tourism to maintain rapid growth, but hydropower remains the priority.</p>
<p>&quot;Hydropower is all there really is,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;Laos only has natural resources -- water, gems and timber -- and hydropower is the least environmentally destructive.&quot;</p>
<p>Monemany Nhoybouakong, environment director of the government's Science, Technology and Environment Organisation (STENO), agreed. &quot;We have to be self-sufficent. We should base our (economic development) on our natural resources, and on our hydropower...in a sustainable manner,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>But analysts said the boost in hydropower, the country's main source of foreign exchange earnings, will not solve one problem: the country's heavy reliance on the Thai economy.</p>
<p>Laos is counting on the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) to buy much of its power, which makes some officials uncomfortable.</p>
