<p>Dariusz Wosz marked his debut for European champions Germany with a late winner in the friendly against Israel on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wosz, who won seven pre-1990 caps for East Germany, struck the only goal of the match in the 85th minute.</p>
<p>He pounced after central defender Gadi Brumer failed to clear a high ball into the penalty area.</p>
<p>In the first match between unified Germany and Israel, the host side, missing several key players, more than held their own in the first half.</p>
<p>But the Germans held the upper hand for much of the second half and eventually broke Israel's stout resistance when Bochum's Wosz was quick to take advantage of Brumer's error.</p>
<p>Wosz's strike was rough justice on Israel goalkeeper Rafi Cohen who made a string of fine saves in the second half.</p>
<p>Israel, without the potent finishing power of the  injured Ronnen Harazi and lacking the creative midfield skills of Eyal Berkovic and Haim Revivo, lacked the spark which might have made a difference.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a distinct difference between our play in the first and second halves,&quot; said relieved Germany coach Berti Vogts.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the Israelis' excellent play in the first half we played well later on and deserved this result, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>&quot;But perhaps if the match had ended in a 1-1 draw it would have given me a better excuse to push the players harder for our forthcoming World Cup qualifiers.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel coach Shlomo Scharf was full of praise for his team. &quot;I am not disappointed with the result,&quot; he said. &quot;To have lost to Germany 1-0 is no disgrace, particularly after the way we played.</p>
<p>&quot;Even without several of our best players we managed to play against them on an even footing.&quot;</p>
