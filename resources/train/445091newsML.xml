<p>Two Americans and two Germans were detained during a protest in Belarus against President Alexander Lukashenko, state television said on Saturday.</p>
<p>A  journalist who was arrested with three of the four foreigners on Friday said they had been released after several hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Several people were arrested, including two American and two German citizens, for active participation in the protest,&quot; the television announcer said, quoting the interior ministry.</p>
<p>One of the Americans works for an international centre on cultural affairs in Minsk. The two Germans were working for a student newspaper and were members of the Green Party, the journalist, Roman Yakovlevsky, said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were held for few hours. They took our fingerprints, filmed us and let us go,&quot; Yakovlevsky said.</p>
<p>Reuters correspondents saw about 50 people being bundled into lorries and police vehicles at Friday's protest, raising fears that a second protest planned for Saturday could also lead to confrontation with police.</p>
<p>The demonstrators had intended to proceed through the city, a move banned by the authorities.</p>
<p>Some protesters were beaten and looked dazed but there was no sign of bloodshed as police moved in to break up a gathering of up to 2,000 mostly young people.</p>
<p>Other journalists who had been detained at the rally also said they were held for a few hours and then released.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, facing growing unrest among opposition forces, has ordered restrictions on political meetings and banned his opponents from using post-independence national symbols, which he has scrapped in favour of old Soviet ones.</p>
<p>The United States said on Friday it had downgraded its relationship with Belarus because of what it called a &quot;serious turn for the worse&quot; in the human rights situation.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the government had imposed what he called severe restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly.</p>
<p>He noted that political party offices had been searched by police and cited strong-arm tactics against demonstrators.</p>
<p>Washington is concerned at plans for closer ties between Russia and Belarus which Russian President Boris Yeltsin said on Friday could even extend to a full merger one day.</p>
