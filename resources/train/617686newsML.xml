<p>Tourist arrivals in Cyprus sank 7.5 percent in 1996 as publicity given to violence on the holiday island scared people off, travel agents said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tourist arrivals last year, shaken by the most serious disturbances since the Turkish invasion in 1974, reached 1.95 million compared to 2.1 million in 1995.</p>
<p>The reduction pushed the contribution of tourism to Cyprus's gross domestic product down to 18 percent in 1996, compared to 21 percent in 1995, said Panicos Apeyitos, chairman of the Association of Cyprus Travel Agents (ACTA).</p>
<p>Foreign exchange earnings from tourism reached 780 million pounds ($1.55 billion), down 3.7 percent from 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;As regards 1997 it is not possible to make safe forecasts,&quot; Apeyitos told the annual general meeting of ACTA in the island's capital Nicosia.</p>
<p>&quot;What is certain is that during the first months of 1997 there has been a reduction in bookings...though the summer season most likely will not lag behind that of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;If there will be no further negative publicity and we are active more in the field of promotion and advertising, 1997 may reach the same levels as 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>The island, which draws hundreds of thousands of European holidaymakers every year, has been divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 sparked by a brief Greek Cypriot coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>The government and local tourism officials have blamed the decline in tourism arrivals on what they see as excessive publicity given to incidents which occurred last August on the ceasefire line cutting through the island.</p>
<p>Two Greek Cypriots were killed by Turks or Turkish Cypriots in separate incidents during mass protests in the United Nations-controlled buffer zone and a month later a Turkish Cypriot sentry was found shot dead at his post.</p>
<p>ACTA, affiliated to the Cyprus chamber of commerce and industry, represents 221 Cypriot travel companies.</p>
