<p>Two more Sierra Leone journalists who were critical of a May 25 coup have gone into hiding after a crackdown by soldiers and police against their newspaper, colleagues said on Monday.</p>
<p>Gibril Foday Musa, managing editor of The New Tablet, and Emmanuel Senessie, a journalist on the newspaper, went into hiding on Monday after the arrest of three newspaper sellers and the confiscation of copies of the latest edition.</p>
<p>The New Tablet has called on Sierra Leone's military rulers to stand down, denouncing their regime as illegal. The latest edition dismissed a weekend state radio announcement that the newspaper was not registered as &quot;an attempt by a group of bullies to intimidate us into fear and silence&quot;.</p>
<p>The head of the Sierra Leone journalists association, Frank Kposowa, went into hiding on Saturday after soldiers raided the offices of his newspaper looking for him and took away four members of staff, colleagues said.</p>
<p>His independent Unity Now newspaper has been critical of military rule. The latest edition called for the immediate departure of the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and criticised the country's chief justice for swearing in military leader Johnny Paul Koroma as head of state.</p>
<p>Soldiers toppled Sierra Leone's civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah on May 25, just over a year after multi-party elections ended four years of army rule. Rebels, who signed a fragile peace deal with Kabbah, rallied to the coup.</p>
