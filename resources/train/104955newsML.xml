<headline>Russian MinFins still go up buyoed by rating.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-10-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds rose further on Wednesday on optimism prompted by Russia's rating for its forthcoming Eurobond issue but dealers forecast profit-taking could start soon.</p>
<p>The three international rating agencies, IBCA, Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's gave Russia high speculative ratings. IBCA gave Russia BB+ for long-term foreign-currency debt, S&amp;P gave it a BB- long-term rating and Moody's assigned Russia Ba2.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Oct 9		   Oct 8</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    83.00-83.30	   81.70-82.00</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    60.25-60.55	   58.30-58.60</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    43.25-43.55	   41.25-41.55</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    49.10-49.40	   46.80-47.10</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    37.35-37.65	   33.90-34.10</p>
<p>&quot;Buying is going on as it has been all this week, mainly because the rating is higher than expected... Some people were closing their positions but there has been no resistance today,&quot; Imperial Bank dealer Alexei Denisov said.</p>
<p>Bankers Trust dealer Adam Elstein said: &quot;MinFins are etremely well bid, both by Russians and the West.&quot;</p>
<p>He added the fifth tranche was actively traded and it rose some two figures mainly on Russian buying.</p>
<p>Dealers said rumours of a rating upgrade for Brazil, which were boosting prices of Brazilian Bradies, could also be helping MinFins.</p>
<p>Dealers forecast the upward trend could be close to its end as MinFin bond prices have risen three to five points since Monday's announcement of the ratings.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has started to get into a range where Western investors could decide that MinFins are already fairly priced over Eurobonds and we may see some profit-taking,&quot; Elstein said.</p>
<p>&quot;But prices will be favourably supported and will not fall much,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Denisov forecast the fourth and fifth tranches were likely to run into resistance at 61.00 and 44.50 respectively, while the shortest maturity still had the ability to rise several more big figures .</p>
<p>The sixth and seventh tranches, issued this May, are less liquid inside Russia.</p>
