<p>British water and sewerage company Yorkshire Water Plc said on Friday that it would continue to improve performance to achieve &quot;the best possible outcome for both customers and shareholders&quot; at its next price review in 1999.</p>
<p>Yorkshire said annual pretax profits rose to 215.8 million pounds ($353.4 million) from 162.2 million previously and paid out a total dividend of 18.5 pence per share, which was up 19.4 percent from a previous adjusted 15.5 pence to take account of a capital restructuring.  </p>
<p>&quot;The last year has been one of focus,&quot; the company said in a statement, adding that customers were its priority, with heavy investment to improve service.</p>
<p>It said that even if the conditions of 1995 were repeated, when a very dry summer in Yorkshire's area almost forced cuts in essential domestic supplies, &quot;water restrictions should not prove to be necessary this summer.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said it had reduced leakage and introduced a free service to mend leaks on customers' pipes and those of businesses and Yorkshire said it was &quot;determined&quot; to reduce leakage further.</p>
<p>Britain's new Labour government has said it will set mandatory targets for cutting leaks as part of a 10-point crisis plan aimed at dealing with the country's worst drought in 200 years, and it also plans a one-off tax on the &quot;excess profits&quot; of privatised utilities which could include Yorkshire.</p>
