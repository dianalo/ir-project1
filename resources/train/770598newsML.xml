<p>Turkish police have fined more than 500 drivers in a central town for blocking traffic and beeping their horns in Islamist protests against secularist education reforms, Anatolian news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said police had fined 556 car and truck drivers a total of 1.6 billion lira ($10,000) over the last three days in protests in the traditionalist town of Kayseri.</p>
<p>Islamists have been driving around the town in vehicle convoys to protest government plans to extend secularist schooling in a bill that would close religious high schools.</p>
<p>Dozens of people were arrested in Ankara on Tuesday in an Islamist march in protest at the reforms that turned ugly. Eleven people, mostly journalists, were injured when police baton-charged crowds outside the education ministry.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has vowed to push the education bill through parliament in the coming weeks despite the protests. $1 = 159,390</p>
