<p>The yield on Kazakh six-month Treasury bills (GKOs) could fall next week while the yield on three-month paper will remain roughly the same, given the stable tenge currency and high foreign demand, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan's Finance Ministry is offering 600 million tenge of six-month T-bills at an auction on Monday, followed by 650 million tenge of three-month bills on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the six-month paper is most likely to fall because there is still much potential for the decrease of its yield,&quot; said Oleg Tsurkan, head treasurer at ABN AMRO Bank Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>At the last auction of six-month GKOs on March 4 the yield fell to 26.27 percent annual from 27.76 percent on February 17.</p>
<p>Tsurkan said active participation by foreign investors used to more moderate returns could be behind the fall in yields.</p>
<p>&quot;But as for three-month GKOs, their yields seem to have already fallen to their lowest point, even for foreign investors,&quot; Tsurkan said.</p>
<p>At the last auction on Tuesday, yields on three-month paper fell to 21.23 percent annual from 21.81 percent last week.</p>
<p>Tsurkan said an added attraction for foreign investors was the stability of the tenge, which the National Bank has held between 75 and 76 per dollar since the beginning of January.</p>
<p>&quot;But even if the dollar rate starts growing, yields will continue to edge down due to growing foreign demand,&quot; said Denis Fedosenko, dealer at Kazkommertsbank.</p>
<p>A Western banker based in Almaty told Reuters investors were expecting larger issues of state securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is, for market development you need a much larger stock of debt,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government plans to raise this year around $200 million to cover the budget gap.</p>
<p>Foreigners' interest in investing in Kazakh GKOs might have been further stimulated by Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin's statement on Thursday that the oil-rich republic's 1997 budget deficit could be increased to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product from the planned 3.16 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Around 70 percent of the budget gap is financed through GKOs, and it could go up to 100 percent next year,&quot; the banker said.</p>
