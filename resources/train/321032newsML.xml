<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy left on Tuesday for a visit to Cuba, underscoring Canada's independent policy towards the communist-ruled island.</p>
<p>A foreign affairs spokesman said Axworthy hoped to meet President Fidel Castro on Tuesday night and would have talks with other Cuban officials before leaving on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Canada has gone head-to-head with Washington over the U.S. Helms-Burton Act, which seeks to penalise some foreign companies doing business with Cuba.</p>
<p>Ottawa argues that the United States is improperly interfering in its affairs and says it pursues a policy of dialogue and engagement with countries like Cuba.</p>
<p>The United States, which has sought to isolate Cuba, has urged Canada and the European Union to press the Caribbean nation to promote democracy.</p>
<p>Commenting on the visit, U.S. Embassy spokesman Andrew Koss said: &quot;We've pressed Canada to be more vocal in its opposition to the Castro regime and promote democracy and human rights on the island.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our hope that Foreign Minister Axworthy's visit will reinforce this message.&quot;</p>
<p>Axworthy said before departing that human rights would be among the topics he would discuss.</p>
<p>He will be the highest ranking Canadian to visit Cuba since former prime minister Pierre Trudeau went there in 1976.</p>
