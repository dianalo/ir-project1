<p>The Azerbaijan International Operating Company said on Friday it would evaluate options by April 30 for a new pipeline to carry main output and said work on a Georgian route for early oil would be done by end-1998.</p>
<p>AIOC President Terry Adams told a news conference AIOC would spend $315 million on a pipeline linking Sangachal near the Azeri capital Baku to the Georgian Black Sea outlet of Supsa.</p>
<p>Expenditures in 1997 for this would total $150 million.</p>
<p>He said AIOC would drill a third evaluation well at its $8 billion project in the Azeri sector of the Caspian Sea next month and that it was sticking to an August 28 start-up date at its project at the Azeri, Chirag and deep-water Guneshli fields.</p>
<p>AIOC will use two routes to export its early oil to Black Sea outlets, one through Russia and one through ex-Soviet Georgia.</p>
<p>The Georgian route consists of 601 km (370 miles) of existing pipeline, to be reconstructed. AIOC will build 258 km (160) miles of new pieline as part of the link.</p>
<p>The Russian early export route is through an existing trunk pipeline north through Chechnya and upwards to Novorossiisk.</p>
<p>Adams said AIOC would spend an additional $270 million to reach its August production date.</p>
<p>Azeri state oil company SOCAR foreign investment head Valekh Aleskerov said Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft still needed to resolve technical and economic issues related to its agreement with AIOC to carry the early oil.</p>
<p>SOCAR President Natik Aliyev said he hoped Moscow would resolve the points soon, but did not say what they were.</p>
<p>Moscow is struggling to reach an agreement with Chechnya on possible oil transit fees through the Caucasus region's section of the link.</p>
<p>The Georgian route also requires construction of five pumping station, two decompression units and related infrastructure. The link will have a capacity of 115,000 barrels per day (bpd).</p>
<p>The Russian route has a capacity of 100,000 bpd.</p>
<p>AIOC expects early oil output of around 100,000 bpd, rising to 700,000-800,000 bpd by 2010.</p>
<p>AIOC is a 13-member international energy consortium led by an alliance of British Petroleum and Den norse stats oljeselskap (Statoil).</p>
