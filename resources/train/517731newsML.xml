<headline>INSIGHT - U.S. debt futures seen extending gains.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. debt futures are expected to extend Thursday's gains in the next several sessions, particularly if June T-bonds close above the 20-day moving average of 107-22/32, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>Terence Gabriel, a technical analyst at IDEA Inc, said a close above 107-22/32 would be the first time June bonds closed above their 20-day moving average since February 26.</p>
<p>He said the negative momentum of the contract's moving average, which has been forming a negative slope on the charts, has been slowing. He said the moving average has been rising after hitting its lowest level in mid-March.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rate of decline has been slowing down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, June T-bonds steadily inched up to 108-07/32, near resistance at 108-08/32, on short-covering pressure. Short-covering was sparked Thursday morning by U.S. weekly jobless claims, which rose to 332,000 from the prior week's upward revised 324,000, and compared with average trade forecasts for 317,000.</p>
<p>However, some analysts said the stage for the market's rally was set on Wednesday when June bonds managed to creep up towards 107-17/32 despite stronger than expected monthly gains in industrial production.  </p>
<p>But on Thursday, June T-bonds finally cracked the 2-1/2 week high of 107-28/32, which also represents the weekly Gann resistance level, Gabriel said.</p>
<p>Both bond and Eurodollar futures showed constructive internal factors in the last several days, such as positive daily stochastics. Weekly stochastics for September Eurodollars were particularly oversold.</p>
<p>Like June bonds, September Eurodollars rallied out of their 2-1/2 week range.  </p>
<p>September rose to 93.775, above the March 27 high of 93.77 which had confined the contract for the last 2-1/2 weeks.</p>
<p>Gabriel also noted that September held above 93.63, a trendline measurement from July 1996, when the market sold off sharply last week. The contract set a daily low of 93.64 on last Friday, Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>Resistance for the contract is at 93.89 and 93.92, the 200-day moving average.  </p>
<p>Several analysts are looking for June T-bonds to rise to 108-24/32 to 109-00 in the near term, but said the contract would have to rise above 109-16/32 to turn the medium-term trend positive. ((Derivatives desk 312-408-8750))</p>
