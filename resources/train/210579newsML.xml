<headline>Eurobourses open mixed after Wall St sags.</headline>

<p>European bourses began Friday in two minds after Wall Street made a small loss on Thursday, reviving doubts over its recent record-breaking gains.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar remained anchored just below the 1.50 level against the mark, but weakened against the yen on reports that Japan's discount rate is too low and may rise soon, traders said.</p>
<p>London, Europe's biggest bourse, opened slightly higher then romped ahead around 0.5 percent when buyers emerged for energy utilities following recent bid activity and positive press comments for the sector.</p>
<p>But business remained thin and dealers said the market was just as likely to drift back as investors played safe ahead of next week's budget and fretted about the danger of British rate rises and the strong pound.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to see a lot of significant moves today on no volume at all. There won't be much business behind it though. No one will want to do much before the budget,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Early attention also focused on Berisford, which soared 25p to 146p after it said it had received a preliminary approach.</p>
<p>Dealers said the early flurry of activity was likely to die off as investors returned to worrying about the budget and the risk Chancellor Kenneth Clarke might be tempted into a round of pre-election tax cuts.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Confederation of British Industry's monthly trends survey, which identified rising manufacturing demand, and recent figures showing consumer spending, would reinforce fears of a monetary tightening before Christmas.</p>
<p>All eyes were now on Tuesday's budget, which one dealer tipped would contain around two billion pounds ($3.4 billion) of tax cuts and more curbs on public spending.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares started bourse dealings lower after Wall Street's weaker close on Thursday and were down 0.4 percent at 1000 GMT.</p>
<p>After setting November's 10th record high on Wednesday, Wall Street's Dow Jones index slipped 11.55 points to 6,418.47 as modest profit taking dragged it back from record highs.</p>
<p>German dealers said business was thin and the market was consolidating after recent gains. Deutsche Telekom weakened further after falling in New York overnight.</p>
<p>French shares also showed modest losses at the opening and were down 0.2 percent at 1000 GMT with operators taking profits and allowing the market to consolidate.</p>
<p>Traders said franc softness along with a cautious Wall Street were factors steering the market lower. Eurotunnel fell 1.32 percent, continuing the week's weakness since a fire disrupted services.</p>
<p>The dollar recovered some of its breath after dipping against the yen in early European trade and held steady against the mark, though hovering beneath the psychological barrier of 1.50 marks.</p>
<p>Against the yen the dollar was well bid on dips after it softenedto a session low at 111.10 yen, with traders saying it should remain well supported above the 111.00 level.</p>
<p>Pat Magill, head of Daiwa Europe's corporate desk, said the dollar's dip against the yen had followed reports that a vice minister at Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) had said the discount rate of 0.5 percent was too low and should rise soon.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 111.26 yen and 1.4986 marks against 111.43 yen and 1.4980 marks late on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 20.4 points at 3,974.2.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was down 4.48 points at 2,229.09.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was down 13.06 points at 2,759.28.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>Gold opened firmer at $377.00 against $376.65 at the London close on Thursday. Good physical demand in Europe helped prices.</p>
