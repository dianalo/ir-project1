<title>GERMANY: Firmer Bunds and futures begin Greenspan vigil.</title>
<headline>Firmer Bunds and futures begin Greenspan vigil.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-07-22</dateline>

<p>German debt markets would need an unexpected jolt on Tuesday to push them out of rather subdued trading ranges.</p>
<p>But with no domestic or U.S. data on the horizon, traders say waiting for Alan Greenspan will be the order of the day.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve chairman, who is due to deliver his Humphrey Hawkins testimony on the state of the economy at around 1800 GMT, will ensure that many players remain on the sidelines of debt markets in Europe this session.</p>
<p>By 0620 GMT, the September DTB Bund contract was two basis points higher at 102.72.  </p>
<p>Technical analysts said the September contract would face first resistance at 102.80, the high point reached during Monday's session. Beyond there, 102.98 and 103.00 will emerge as the next major hurdles.</p>
<p>On the support side, losses are expected to be limited to around 102.53 this session.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market would be expecting Greenspan to give a relatively tame view of the U.S. economy, but would be on the lookout for any sign of whether he continues to believe the current economic slowdown -- from the somewhat alarming pace of late last year -- is still temporary.  </p>
<p>&quot;If he does not sound as worried about excessive economic growth and excessive asset price inflation as he did at the last Humphrey-Hawkins presentation in February, it would present a key change,&quot; said Karl Haeling, head of DMG Futures and Options in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>In February, Greenspan famously commented on &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in financial markets, sending the U.S. stock market swiftly south. Since then U.S. shares have climbed again to new peaks, boosted by a positive economic outlook.</p>
<p>For Bunds, any sharp move in either direction will be determined U.S. Treasuries' reaction to Greenspan's words.  </p>
<p>But analysts said the market had a supportive base and was unlikely to take too much of a beating unless Greenspan were to be very hawkish.</p>
<p>Later in the week, Bunds have domestic events to digest, with cost of living numbers from German states due from Wednesday and Thursday's final Bundesbank council meeting before the summer break.</p>
<p>Analysts said that although M3 money supply growth hit the Bundesbank's target corridor for the first time this year in June, the weakness of the mark and the overall economic picture would ensure that official interest rates are kept on hold.</p>
