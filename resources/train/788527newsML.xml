<p>Sterling was hit by further selling in morning trading on Friday and key European stock markets also slipped lower, prompted by an overnight fall on Wall Street from record levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The sterling bubble has well and truly burst,&quot; said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro.</p>
<p>The pound shed more than five pfennigs from an early high against the mark, dropping below 2.93 marks, and hit a 10-month low against the dollar.</p>
<p>Its decline, jolted by indications from the Bank of England that further interest rate rises were off the menu in the near future, in turn unsettled the U.S. currency, which faded after earlier rebounding against the mark.</p>
<p>The British currency had gained around 20 percent overall in the last year but a weakening from recent peaks had recently taken some pressure off British exporters and helped boost London shares to new records.</p>
<p>Sterling has slipped 4.5 percent from this week's highs against the mark and around 3.5 percent against the dollar.</p>
<p>But despite the renewed decline in the pound, the London stock market, Europe's biggest, dropped nearly half a percent from a record close on Thursday. The Frankfurt and Paris bourses both lost more than one percent.</p>
<p>The London market hit new highs on Thursday when the Bank of England indicated that interest rates might not have to rise again for a while after the latest quarter point increase to seven percent.</p>
<p>But on Wall Street, renewed jitters over higher U.S. rates sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 70 points overnight after it had showed a 22 point gain at the time of London's close.</p>
<p>This influenced European markets at the opening but  dealers said London shares should move higher again before long. During the morning market attention shifted to smaller capitalised stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that people are perceiving (interest) rates to be on hold for a while, these stocks are the ones to buy,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Frankfurt shares fell on profit-taking after strong recent gains and as the dollar slipped -- bad news for exporters. But German bank shares tried to resist the trend amid a fresh wave of takeover speculation.</p>
<p>Profit taking and the easing of the dollar also helped send the Paris bourse lower.</p>
<p>The dollar had earlier revived from an early downward blip against the mark. Currency market operators viewed the German economy as too weak to withstand higher interest rates despite comments by a central banker suggesting the Bundesbank did not want the mark to weaken further.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a good time for a rate hike,&quot; said Stefan Schilbe, economist at Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt in Dusseldorf.</p>
<p>Bundesbank Council member Ernst Welteke, speaking on German radio, said the central bank had already signalled it thought the dollar's correction was completed at 1.70 marks. This drove the dollar down as low as 1.8625 marks.</p>
<p>But, after reflection, traders focused more on the fact that he also said slow German economic growth and high unemployment meant it was not appropriate to &quot;turn the interest rate screw&quot;. The dollar rose above 1.87 marks again but slipped back later in the morning.</p>
<p>Speculation that the Bundesbank will act to boost money market rates has grown as the dollar has scored near eight-year highs in recent weeks. There was also nervousness that the central bank could intervene to stem the mark's slide after Welteke said the Bundesbank had no exact date for intervening in currency markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>The dollar also retreated against the yen, affected by market concern that a widening in Japan's trade surplus with the United States could spark renewed trade tensions.</p>
<p>A report showed Japan's current account surplus leapt nearly 56 percent in June from a year earlier and that the trade surplus rose nearly 19 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>Market analysts expect Japanese officials to protest against any dollar gains above 120 yen to ward off a tougher stance on trade by the U.S. administration</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.8653 marks and 117.48 yen, compared with 1.8744 and 118.55 in late trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sterling dipped to 2.9265 marks and $1.5707 from 2.9695 marks and $1.5861 late on Thursday.</p>
