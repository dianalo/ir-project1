<title>AUSTRALIA: Docile Australian dlr tethered in tight range.</title>
<headline>Docile Australian dlr tethered in tight range.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-06-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian dollar sat back and sulked at a quiet midsession after an early tilt at the upside faltered in the face of investor indifference.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was more than content to trade the US$0.7560/7680 range established over the last fortnight and await developments on monetary policy both here and in the U.S.</p>
<p>The day's only data showed ANZ job advertisement series dipped 7.3 percent in May as a statistical correction to April's record 16.7 percent increase. The trend continued to point to jobs growth picking up as the year progressed, but probably not with the alacrity needed to rule out another rate cut.  </p>
<p>By 12.30 pm (0230 GMT) the currency had edged back to US$0.7606/11 from an early US$0.7615/20 having wandered between US$0.7590 and US$0.7624 through Monday's holiday hit session.</p>
<p>It finished here Friday at US$0.7591/96 but did make a brief foray to a US$0.7645 high offshore.</p>
<p>On the crosses it was down at 85.95/05 yen from 87.80/90 late here Friday as a swift retreat in US$/yen spooked Japanese investors out of long dollar-bloc positions. That contributed to a 0.3 point drop in the trade weighted index to 57.6.</p>
<p>US$/yen put in a rally this morning to reach 113.00 yen from a 111.80 low, which in turn lifted AUD/yen from a 85.00 trough.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the A$ continued to suffer from the loss of its interest advantage over the US$ following the Reserve Bank's rate cut on May 23, which brought domestic rates to U.S. levels for the first time since the early 1980's.</p>
<p>The market had already gone further, driving short rates well below those in the U.S. in the fear the RBA might yet ease again while the Federal Reserve was on a tightening trip.</p>
<p>The outlook for local rates might be a little clearer after May labour data are released Thursday, particularly as the bank has oft linked past easings to the stubbornly high rate of unemployment.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately for an impatient market the data will not be decisive for policy if they meet median expectations of a 15,000 rise in employment and a stable jobless rate of 8.7 percent.</p>
<p>Estimates do range from a 5,00 fall to a 25,000 rise, with the former likely to have the greater impact since it would be taken as a green light for an imminent easing.</p>
<p>Today's ANZ job ads for May offered few clues on what to expect as they were biased lower by a statistical quirk in April which delivered a record 16.7 percent rise. Given the notorious volatility of the monthly jobs data the market will not be taking the A$ far before then. -- Wayne Cole 61-2 9373 1800</p>
