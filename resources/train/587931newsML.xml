<p>A group of major airlines, including Deutsche Lufthansa AG and United Airlines, on Wednesday formally branded an existing partnership under the name &quot;Star Alliance&quot; but said they would not merge.</p>
<p>The alliance, which also includes Air Canada, Scandinavian Airlines Systems and Thai Airways International Ltd, aims to create a global image for the alliance but for carriers to keep their identities.</p>
<p>The new alliance rivals that announced last year by British Airways and American Airlines, but airline executives said they did not expect the partnership to violate anti-competition laws.</p>
<p>&quot;The Star Alliance poses no threat to competition and provides distinct customer benefits,&quot; the airlines said in a statement issued at a news conference at Frankfurt airport.</p>
<p>The launch of Star Alliance prompted American Airlines to call again on the British and U.S. governments to approve its alliance with British Airways, which has been dogged by regulators since being announced last June.</p>
<p>Other airlines are expected to join Star Alliance. There was confirmation on Wednesday that Brazil's Varig Airlines will join the group in October.</p>
<p>The partners said other potential partners include South African Airways and regional European carrier British Midland , which both now cooperate with Lufthansa.</p>
<p>Talks were also being held with unnamed Asian airlines to strengthen the alliance's presence in the expanding region but alliance airline executives declined further comment.</p>
<p>&quot;Asia is the fastest growing region in terms of air traffic growth. Looking to the future of the alliance, we are hopeful there will be other airlines in that region who join,&quot; Lufthansa chief executive Juergen Weber told reporters.</p>
<p>Alliance chiefs would not comment on the possibility of Hong Kong-basaed Cathay Pacific joining the alliance, an airline seen as strategically important in the Asian market.</p>
<p>Industry analysts have said Asia was a critical market and there was no doubt partnerships will be formed in Asia.</p>
<p>The airlines, which have worked closely for a few years, said they would not take equity stakes in one another and each airline would keep their individual identities.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not our intention to merge our airlines nor to develop identical product offerings. Our research tells us categorically that our customers enjoy and appreciate our varied cultures,&quot; the airlines said.</p>
<p>The branding deal, a bid to cut costs and offer integrated &quot;same airline&quot; travel for passengers and cargo, creates one of the largest industry alliances.</p>
<p>The five airlines have a combined staff of more than 210,000 employees and flights to 578 cities in 106 countries.</p>
<p>The alliance airlines showed off the power of their size, saying their combined revenues in 1996 totalled $42.3 billion and they carried about 174 million passengers on flights around the world.</p>
<p>The partners projected annual global passenger growth of five to six percent in the coming years and Lufthansa said cargo shipment growth would average six to seven percent.</p>
<p>The partnership calls for common branding in marketing and advertising and to intensify, when possible, coordination of routes and the offering of code-share flights.</p>
<p>Passengers will also be able to accumulate and redeem mileage points on any of the partner airlines and for further integration of some airport operations, purchasing and ticketing operations.</p>
