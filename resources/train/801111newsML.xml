<p>Indonesian central bank governor Sudradjad Djiwandono said on Thursday that the lifting of the bank's intervention band implied a free float of the rupiah although it reserved the right to intervene if needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Theoretically, it's a free float,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television in an interview. &quot;But of course Bank Indonesia would like to intervene to keep developments on course, to smooth the adaptment period.</p>
<p>&quot;Our job as the monetary authority is to provide a good climate for the business sector,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Djiwandono said that the move had led to rapid falls in the rupiah but he hoped the currency would level off.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope it will lead to a new equilibrium,&quot; he said. &quot;The equilibrium may not be a fixed point, it could be an area.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the decision to do away with the intervention band was taken with careful consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not mean we are going haywire,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Djiwandono also said there would be no move to introduce exchange controls on the rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should we control?&quot; he said when asked if there was a possibility of any such move.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the float of the rupiah was in response to similar moves undertaken by the Philippines and Thailand in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a regional market now. We are moving together,&quot; Djiwandono said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last few weeks Indonesia is the only one which had a band, it's the only one defending the rupiah,&quot; he said adding that maintaining that position would be more and more difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;We are adjusting to the new realities,&quot; he said. &quot;The new reality in the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) region is floating (currencies).&quot;</p>
