<title>USA: CBOT traders say USDA data bullish for soy futures.</title>
<headline>CBOT traders say USDA data bullish for soy futures.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade traders said data in the USDA crop report appeared bullish for CBOT soybeans, and expected those futures to open two to four cents per bushel higher Wednesday.</p>
<p>USDA reduced its soybean ending stocks estimate to 140 million bushels from 155 million in the January report.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the bean number, you have to say, is bullish on the ending stocks figure,&quot; said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities. &quot;Some of that was anticipated. I think it will be muted. The government is telling us that we're taking the world (production) number up.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders expected CBOT corn and wheat to open one to two cents higher, larger in reaction to expected gains in soybeans. USDA left corn ending stocks unchanged at 959 million bushels but raised wheat ending stocks to 474 million bushels from 469 million in January.  </p>
<p>&quot;The wheat number, after yesterday's rally, was more of a neutral to negative,&quot; said Roose.</p>
<p>But the greatest price reaction should be in soybeans, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The floor talk was they would take it down (soybean ending stocks) five to 10 million but they took it down 15 so it's a touch friendly for beans,&quot; said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>USDA increased its soybean export estimate to 905 million bushels from 900 million and increased the crush to 1.410 billion from 1.400 billion.</p>
<p>USDA's soybean estimates for Argentina and Brazil were about as expected, traders said. Argentina's crop was raised to 13.50 million tonnes versus 13.00 million in January and Brazil's was raised to 26.50 million from 26.00 million.</p>
