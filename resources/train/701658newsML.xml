<p>Albania's Socialists, virtually assured of victory in general elections, took a key step in establishing control over the country's police force ahead of forming a government to end months of upheaval.</p>
<p>Counting of Sunday's vote was painfully slow, but Socialist leader Fatos Nano told reporters on Tuesday that Interior Minister Belul Celo had left Albania and had been replaced by his second-in-command, a Socialist Party member.</p>
<p>Officials refused to confirm the appointment of Lush Perpali as acting minister, but within minutes of Nano's announcement, police armoured vehicles roared down Tirana's boulevards in a show of force.</p>
<p>The police drove repeatedly through the city centre before a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew went into effect under emergency regulations in place since March. There was no repetition of some unusually frequent volleys of gunfire on Monday evening.</p>
<p>President Sali Berisha conceded earlier that his Democratic Party had been beaten into opposition, but did not say if he would step down.</p>
<p>Nano said the new government would be made up of three or four parties. &quot;There is room for all in this country, even for Berisha,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Control over the Interior Ministry is critical to holding power in a country which emerged from Stalinist rule only seven years ago. The ministry remained in Democrat hands after tough negotiations in March when Berisha was forced to form a multi-party government and agree to the early election.</p>
<p>Final returns from 25 of the 115 districts contested under majority voting on Sunday gave the Socialists a big lead. They won 13 seats, with two more going to their Social Democratic allies.</p>
<p>The Democrats captured three seats and the remaining seven will go to a run-off next Sunday because no candidate won the 50 percent required for victory in the first round.</p>
<p>Partial returns for 40 seats under proportional voting gave the Socialists and two allied parties 53 percent of the vote, compared to the Democrats' 30 percent. The Socialists could improve that score with results still to come from southern regions hostile to the president.</p>
<p>The new government will have to restore order, particularly in the south, after months of disorder in which more than 1,500 people were killed. The violence was sparked by the collapse of pyramid savings schemes with the loss of life savings of countless numbers of families.</p>
<p>&quot;With the support the voters have given us we have managed first to disarm politics and the minds of politicians,&quot; Nano told the U.S. Cable News Network in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen during the election campaign that people will cooperate with authorities to disarm society, collect weapons and put them back in warehouses where they belong. The priority will be to identify, isolate, neutralise and eliminate with tough legal measures criminal gangs that create tensions.&quot;</p>
<p>The social atmosphere has apparently already improved. The south was largely quiet on election day and reports from one major town, Gjirokaster, said residents had resumed nightly strolls for the first time in five months.</p>
<p>Former Austrian chancellor Franz Vranitzky, head of the pan-European mission that pronounced the election &quot;adequate and acceptable&quot;, told Albanian leaders that the gains of the poll had to be underpinned by Western help.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to be made quite clear that once the elections are over...that everyone in the international community is not going to pack their suitcases and go home,&quot; Vranitzky told reporters after his talks.</p>
