<p>Bligh Oil and Minerals NL said on Tuesday it had encountered a major gas zone in the first well drilled in the Morrow gas play in Texas.  </p>
<p>Bligh said it was not possible to accurately estimate gas reserves until production testing and pressure build-up analysis had been completed.</p>
<p>&quot;However, gas reserves in comparable wells in the immediate area range from 20-50 billion cubic feet of gas per well,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The pay section in the Fleetwood well was one of the thickest known in that portion of the Anadarko basin, it said.</p>
<p>The top of the reservoir was encountered at 4,620.5 metres and the base at 4,673.9 metrees for a gross thickness of 53.4 metres. Net pay within the section amounted to 51 metres.  </p>
<p>Bligh said it expected the well to be completed for testing before year-end, with a view to starting continuous production in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Three additional drillsites had been identified on the West Park block and further drilling was expected in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>The Fleetwood No. 1-16 well is the first of a programme of deep tests planned by Bligh on its holdings in the Anadarko Basin.</p>
<p>The second well, the Thomas Meek No. 1, is curently being drilled 20 km to the west.  </p>
<p>Bligh said wells of the apparent quality of Fleetwood Trust No.1-16 &quot;have the potential to make major contributions to Bligh's cash flow&quot; even at lower levels of working interest.</p>
<p>Bligh has a 25 percent interest in the West Park project. Operator Kerr-McGee Corp has 50 percent, Beartooth Exploration Partners LP 13.75 percent, William A Gruy 1.25 percent, Omega Oil NL 5.00 percent, and Robert C and Gwynneth F Weiss 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>Shares in Bligh were 5.5 cents stronger at 29 cents at 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT).</p>
