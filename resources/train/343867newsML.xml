<p>Thailand's first fully-integrated steel plant is optimistic on the outlook for the domestic steel industry despite concerns of a global steel glut, Anurat Kongtoranin, the president of Thai Special Steel Industry (TSSI) told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who say the steel industry in Thailand is a sunset industry have no clue of what they are talking about. In some developed countries, that might be the case...but not here,&quot; said Anurat, the top executive at TSSI.</p>
<p>Anurat said demand for steel in Thailand was projected to rise by 8-10 percent annually from 12 million tonnes a year currently.</p>
<p>Despite a slump in the property sector, the growth in demand for steel would be sustained by government infrastructure projects and other sectors such as the automotive and machinery assembly industries, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall economy might slow down a bit. But the GDP growth of six or seven percent a year we are having is by all means still strong,&quot; Anurat said.</p>
<p>United Nations industrial analysts warned in a 1996 annual report of a looming world glut of crude steel towards the end of the century as new plants were coming on stream without sufficient consumer demand for the extra output.</p>
<p>But they noted that steel consumption in Asia would continue to be strong, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- of which Thailand is a member -- expected to increase steel consumption faster than GDP growth.</p>
<p>TSSI, a unit of TPI Polene, is building a 25 billion baht integrated-steel project in the eastern province of Rayong.</p>
<p>The company plans to start up the 500,000 tonnes-per-year, higher-quality wire-rod mill by the end of July.</p>
<p>It will import billets, a raw material for wire rod, from South Africa, Brazil and some European countries.</p>
<p>TSSI will also build a blast furnace in the first quarter of 1997. The whole project is scheduled to be complete by the second quarter of 1999 with a capacity of 3.4 million tonnes of hot metal which will be used to produce 800,000 tonnes of pig iron -- a substitute for quality scrap -- and 2.2 million tonnes for billets.</p>
<p>&quot;Our product will replace some of the high-quality imports,&quot; Anurat said, adding that the company expected to break even within six years.</p>
<p>Thailand annually imports about three million tonnes of billet, two million tonnes of scrap, and 800,000 tonnes of wire rod.</p>
<p>Anurat said the support from the government was also essential for the survival of the industry.</p>
<p>He said the steel industry was conducting discussions with the government, urging a change in tax structures and seeking zero tariffs on raw material imports and fairer import tax on steel products.</p>
<p>The government's recent efforts to protect the steel industry from market dumping by cheaper producers like Poland, Russia and some former Soviet republics would also help, he said.</p>
