<p>German shares climbed on Monday to new record highs, but traders said they expected dealings to be range-bound in fairly thin volumes.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 blue chip shares opened floor trade above 2,700 points and rose to a new record high at 2,704.74 before slipping to 2,701.36, a gain of 18.08 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said the index was catching up with gains made during Friday afternoon in IBIS electronic trade when the 2,700 level was initially breached on the strength of Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders are a bit sceptical about these levels,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;We're looking a bit sideways at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if the trading range is going to be pretty tight today, around 2,690 to 2,710,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Shares in insurance company Allianz were steady after the company posted results that were generally in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>Utility stocks, including Veba and Viag, firmed as trading interest moved into the sector from chemicals.</p>
<p>&quot;The utilities are in demand. People are switching out of chemicals which had been the high-flyer sector. Chemicals are a little bit more defensive at the higher levels,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
