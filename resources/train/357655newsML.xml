<headline>Indian metals - Demand for local copper seen rising.</headline>
<dateline>BOMBAY 1997-02-05</dateline>

<p>Demand for domestic copper is expected to rise this week in the absence of imports, with the state-owned Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) reaping the benefit, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been no imports of copper wire bars or rods mainly because of their higher costs compared to similar items made locally,&quot; Bombay Metals Exchange president Sharad Parikh said.</p>
<p>He said HCL on Monday raised the price of copper wire bars by nine rupees to 117 rupees per kg and of wire rods by 14 rupees to 126 rupees per kg.</p>
<p>&quot;Small rolling mills are taking wire bars from HCL, converting them into rods and selling them at around 122 rupees per kg,&quot; Parikh said. &quot;The copper market is going to be firm.&quot;</p>
<p>Parikh said whatever imports there had been were quoted at around 138 rupees per kg for wire bars inclusive of excise duty compared to the domestic price of 134 rupees per kg.</p>
<p>Dealers said importers of copper products are waiting for the fiscal budget for 1997/98 (April/March) to be unveiled on February 28 before placing any orders abroad.</p>
<p>They said import tariffs on non-ferrous metals are expected to be brought down further in line with the government's commitment to economic reforms.</p>
<p>Zinc is another non-ferrous metal which is likely to be firm, according to dealers.</p>
<p>Many small zinc processors, who had been producing ingots from imported ash and dross, were forced to close down following a ban on grounds they were environmental hazards.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a general shortage of zinc ingots,&quot; said Parikh.</p>
<p>In the week to Wednesday, copper gained 250 rupees per quintal (100 kgs) to 13,100 rupees while zinc was up 100 rupees at 6,900 rupees per quintal.</p>
<p>Nickel became a speculators' choice as its international prices rose steeply. It gained 500 rupees per quintal to 37,000 rupees on the Bombay metals market.</p>
<p>Lead and tin were steady at 4,550 rupees per quintal and 34,400 rupees per quintal. Aluminium was unchanged at 7,250 rupees per quintal.</p>
