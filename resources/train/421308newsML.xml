<p>The European Commission has taken a ritual annual stab at curbing incentives to store grain, but its latest plans are unlikely to change the way markets operate in the short run, analysts and traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The European Commission, taking up a theme of previous annual farm price packages, proposed on Tuesday to cut a monthly storage premium for grain by nine percent to one Ecu per tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said earlier the move -- if applied mathematically to current grain values -- would lower prices, though in reality market forces would ensure that this was offset by lower export refunds sought by traders from the European Commission.</p>
<p>By taking aim at the so-called monthly increment, however, the Commission mainly hopes to take part of the domestic cushioning effect of storing grain away from stock holders. That would help make up for steady declines in European interest rates and free up the domestic grain market, EU officials said.</p>
<p>Critics of the system, based on a sliding scale of storage relief throughout the year, complain that grain coooperatives can be encouraged to hold on to supplies at a time when relatively low stocks often leave the market tightly balanced.</p>
<p>The issue is particularly important for French markets where premiums derived from an EU monthly storage increment are added to domestic grain prices twice a month from August onwards.</p>
<p>Cutting the storage payment would reduce domestic prices and, for the same world price, lead to lower export subsidies.</p>
<p>But the question for domestic traders is whether the drop in aid would make a difference to storage firms who have, critics say, effectively been able to use grain as an alternative bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Given financing costs, the cut is not going to change the cooperatives' marketing approach to their grain significantly,&quot; said Noel Fryer of Geneva-based grain consultants Agrinews.</p>
<p>The European Commission has focused on evidence that the return from storage premiums can be worth more to a silo than the cost of parting with grain sooner and pocketing the revenue.</p>
<p>Figures are difficult to obtain, but several traders say the low cost of financing grain in storage makes holding stocks an obvious strategy when domestic markets are going up, as now.</p>
<p>Fryer and others said even the new storage payment of one Ecu a month would make little difference to this equation.</p>
<p>Translated into French francs at the EU's agrimoney green rate, the current monthly storage bonus of 1.1 Ecus means a French supplier now gets 7.27 francs a tonne for holding grain.</p>
<p>If wheat is currently worth some 840 francs a tonne at its point of origin, this is equivalent to interest income worth 10.4 percent of the wheat's value on an annualised basis. French borrowing costs are mostly six to seven percent a year, however, making it appear attractive to store, take the premium and wait.</p>
<p>Cutting the EU increment to a single Ecu would reduce the monthly premium to 6.61 francs or an annual return of 9.4 percent -- still above real borrowing rates, traders said. These may in any case be lower under agricultural lending schemes.</p>
<p>EU officials and some traders have criticised the storage aid as generous or out of date as markets gradually free up. They say it can also contribute to short-term squeezes on grain.</p>
<p>But cooperative managers say the system is justified by the fixed cost of storage and the need to maintain proper capacity.</p>
<p>What happens now is a matter for the politicians.</p>
<p>Brussels sources say EU farm ministers, who must decide on Commission plans by end-June, are likely to tread cautiously on any move to reduce support for cereals and have in the past watered down Commission attempts to cut back the storage aid.</p>
