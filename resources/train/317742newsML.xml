<headline>Canada board gives key approvals to Foothills.</headline>

<p>Canada's National Energy Board said on Monday it approved an application by Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd for facilities forming part of its Eastern Leg Expansion Project.</p>
<p>The expansion would provide about 690 million cubic feet per day of new natural gas transport capacity at the Canada-U.S. border near Monchy, Saskatchewan starting in November 1998.</p>
<p>The addition would translate into about 45 percent more capacity to the system, which runs to Monchy from McNeill on the Alberta-Saskatchewan Border.  </p>
<p>Foothills is co-owned by NOVA Corp and Westcoast Energy Inc.</p>
<p>The NEB said the approval covered an C$18-million expansion of the Foothills decompression/recompression facility on the provincial border, which allows the Eastern Leg to operate at higher pressures while  enabling the extraction of heavier hydrocarbons from the gas stream.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada's Northern Pipeline Agency, another government of Canada regulatory arm, approved the design for the rest of the C$167-million project involving the installation of 113 km of 42-inch pipe and other facilities.  </p>
<p>The facilities were previously given certificates under the Northern Pipeline Act, legislation that followed public hearings involving the Canadian and United States governments in 1977 that led to a framework for the proposed Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System.</p>
<p>The ANGTS is a proposed pipeline megaproject intended to move Alaskan and northern Canadian natural gas 7,700 km to southern markets. Foothills' Eastern and Western legs are the phase I prebuilds for the project.</p>
<p>Phase II, the northern portion, remains on hold and the NEB said the consensus was that completion is many years away.  </p>
<p>Gas transported on the Foothills Eastern Leg is delivered to the Northern Border pipeline system, which moves gas to the U.S. Midwest.</p>
<p>Northern Border, jointly owned by TransCanada PipeLines Ltd and Enron Corp affiliate Northern Border Partners LP, is also planning to expand the capacity of its system and extend it to Chicago from the current termination at Harper, Iowa by 1998.</p>
