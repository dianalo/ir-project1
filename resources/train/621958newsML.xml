<p>Shenzhen's B share index ended marginally higher on Wednesday, encouraged by the Hong Kong stock market hitting a record high but depressed by weaker local A shares, analysts said.</p>
<p>The foreign currency B index edged up 0.27 points or 0.18 percent to 151.34 on turnover of HK$126.9 million against Tuesday's HK$144.4 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;The B index was caught between the A shares and the Hong Kong index,&quot; an analyst at China Guotai Securities said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks closed the Wednesday morning session at an all-time high, riding on renewed red-chip fever -- Hong Kong shares with China backing, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index closed the morning one percent higher at a record 14,685.52.</p>
<p>The B share investors were however edgy about aftershocks from China's government policies to cool the markets and held back after the local currency A index dropped, analysts said.  </p>
<p>The A index slid 3.64 points or 0.83 percent to 436.84 on turnover of 6.5 billion yunn, compared with Tuesday's 6.9 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The A share investors are largely focused on Beijing's possible clampdown on the markets,&quot; an analyst at a major western investment bank said.</p>
<p>State media said on Wednesday the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had set up two special phone lines for investors to report irregularities and illegal trading on the stock markets.  </p>
<p>&quot;People see the phone lines as a warning against stock speculation,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Beijing began to implement policies to dampen stock speculation at the start of May, by which time the A and B indices had surged more than 50 percent from the beginning of 1997.</p>
<p>Weifu Fuel Injection Co Ltd was the best performer in the B share market and added HK$0.34 or 6.77 percent to HK$5.36.</p>
