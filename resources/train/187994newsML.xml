<p>British inflation jumped to its highest level for three years in October, official data showed on Thursday, putting the government under increased pressure to raise interest rates again before the next general election.</p>
<p>Retail prices leapt by 2.7 percent in the year to October compared with 2.1 percent in September, the Office for National Statistics said.</p>
<p>The politically important underlying rate, which excludes mortage interest payments, climbed to 3.3 percent in October from 2.9 percent in September, its highest rate for over three years and well above the government's 2.5 percent target.</p>
<p>The government shrugged off the news.</p>
<p>&quot;Policy is set to meet our inflation target. That is why we are sustaining our best inflation record in 50 years,&quot; said Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke in a statement.</p>
<p>He said technical reasons were behind the large yearly jump in prices. The month-on-month change in both underlying and headline inflation was nil.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason the annual inflation rate is higher is because this time last year there was the largest fall in retail prices in any October since the war.&quot;</p>
<p>But the opposition Labour Party pounced on the figures as evidence the government has mismanaged the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Tories cannot be trusted on the economy. We are not best in Europe for inflation, but 11th out of 15,&quot; said Labour finance spokesman Gordon Brown.</p>
<p>&quot;Within two months of declaring an economic miracle, the cracks are already appearing. Today's news makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's claim that he had conquered inflation,&quot;</p>
<p>City analysts said the figures were unremittingly bad news.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures are really quite bad...showing that retailers are now quite confident about putting up prices,&quot; said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>&quot;It puts the inflation target in extreme jeopardy and is very negative for (financial) markets.&quot;</p>
<p>The recovery in house prices, welcomed by homeowners after five years of decline, put some upward pressure on inflation along with higher petrol prices and car insurance premia.</p>
<p>But the figures, coming only a day after other data showed a huge 40,800 drop in unemployment in October, helped fuel fears that the economy is starting to overheat.</p>
<p>Calls for higher interest rates from the Bank of England and some independent analysts are now likely to grow louder.</p>
<p>Clarke surprised City forecasters when he agreed to raise the cost of borrowing last month to help fend off inflationary pressures, but he only moved the base lending rate up by a quarter point to 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>The latest Bank of England inflation report said rates will have to rise again soon.After the inflation data, analysts said another rate rise before the end of the year now looks a strong possibility.</p>
<p>&quot;Speculation will certainly be on a 6.25 percent base rate at the next monetary meeting in December 11,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica.</p>
<p>But the government may try and resist calls for higher rates in the run up to the election, which must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>Around two-thirds of British households are home owners, most with variable-rate mortages, so interest rate rises are unpopular and the last thing the ruling Conservative needs since they still trail Labour by 20 points in the opinion polls.</p>
<p>The government's lack of popularity is despite an almost exemplary economic recovery, so far combining steady growth, a lively consumer sector, falling unemployment and low inflation.</p>
<p>But Britain's track record on inflation is poor. During the previous business cycle underlying inflation peaked at 9.5 percent in October 1990, forcing interest rates briefly up to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Chancellor Clarke has impressed financial markets with his tough talk on inflation and his willingness to raise rates pre-emptively. But economists said with the election fast approaching, now is the time that his commitment to low inflation may be tested.</p>
<p>He is under intense pressure to deliver a strong sense of economic well-being before the election, and may be tempted to delay another interest rate rise until after the poll.</p>
