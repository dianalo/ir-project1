<headline>U.N. leaves north Iraq camp for Turkish Kurds.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-01-21</dateline>

<p>The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR on Tuesday said it had pulled out of a northern Iraq refugee camp containing up to 14,000 Turkish Kurds who had fled southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;The UNHCR disbanded the Atrush camp today but we continue to assist refugees in different ways,&quot; agency spokesman Metin Corabatir told Reuters.</p>
<p>The UNHCR announced last month it would phase out operations in Atrush because rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) were blocking its work. Ankara had long sought the camp's closure because of the PKK presence.</p>
<p>&quot;The activists in the camp didn't allow us to continue our humanitarian aid. We couldn't even talk to some of the refugees,&quot; Corabatir said.</p>
<p>He said the final aid delivery was made last December and since then the guerrillas had prevented agency staff from entering the camp, 60 km (38 miles) from the Turkish border.</p>
<p>Atrush was set up in 1994 for Kurds fleeing from southeast Turkey, where villagers were caught in the middle of fighting between Turkish troops and PKK rebels fighting for self-rule in the region.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year-old conflict between the PKK and Turkish troops.</p>
<p>Corabatir said the UNHCR would set up two temporary camps in north Iraq for Atrush residents who either wanted to stay in Iraq or go back to Turkey.</p>
<p>The majority of Atrush refugees were still believed to be in the camp, he said. &quot;Our office hasn't received any information that people are moving on.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kurdish DEM news agency, which is close to the PKK, said earlier this month that around 1,000 people had left the camp for areas controlled by the PKK.</p>
<p>The Turkish government has invited the refugees to return to Turkey, giving assurances for their security, housing and health care.</p>
<p>British politicians and writers on Tuesday denounced the U.N. decision to leave the camp. Conservative politicians joined with members of the opposition Labour Party to issue a statement saying the closure &quot;betrays a callous contempt for human rights.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement, also signed by playwrights Tom Stoppard and Harold Pinter, said: &quot;15,000 Kurdish refugees are now quietly and expeditiously sacrificed to suit Turkey's barbaric aims with the apparent approval of the UNHCR following Ankara's intervention in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;Atrush is no ordinary camp. It is the only sanctuary for approximately 15,000 Kurds from north Kurdistan (southeast Turkey) who fled the destruction of their villages and torture and brutal persecution carried out by Turkish gendarmes and soldiers in the last few years.&quot;</p>
