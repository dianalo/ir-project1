<headline>Berlin selling BEWAG because it is broke - minister.</headline>
<dateline>BERLIN 1997-05-13</dateline>

<p>Berlin is selling a majority stake in its power utility Berliner Kraft und Licht AG (BEWAG) because the city is nearly bankrupt and needs the money, Berlin's environmental minister Peter Strieder said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Strieder, the Senator for the Environment, said in an interview with InfoRadio in Berlin that the city was broke because the federal government was failing to live up to its obligations.</p>
<p>&quot;BEWAG is being sold primarily because the city is bankrupt or nearly bankrupt because the federal government has left us standing in the rain,&quot; Strieder said. &quot;It is at the point where we don't really know how we are going to finance the future.&quot;</p>
<p>The city is expected to announce later on Tuesday that it has reached an agreement with a German-U.S. consortium to sell its 50.8 percent stake in BEWAG for 2.9 billion marks.</p>
<p>The stake was expected to be sold to German utility groups VIAG AG and Veba AG and U.S. utility Southern Co. Veba and VIAG each currently hold a 10 percent stake in BEWAG.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to give Atlanta-based Southern, one of the largest utilities in the United States, a 23.6 percent stake in the utility, while Veba and VIAG will also both raise their individual stakes to 23.6 percent.</p>
<p>Berlin's city-state parliament was expected to approve the deal on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Germany's federal cartel office has already expressed an opinion that it was against Veba raising its stake in BEWAG, saying its stake would be too extensive.</p>
<p>But German media reports have said Southern was expected to be formally in charge of the commercial management of BEWAG although all decisions would be reached jointly.</p>
