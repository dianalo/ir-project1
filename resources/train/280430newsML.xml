<title>VENEZUELA: Venezuela modifies foreign exchange band system.</title>
<headline>Venezuela modifies foreign exchange band system.</headline>
<dateline>CARACAS 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Venezuela's Central Bank said it would modify its current foreign exchange bands system by re- setting the central parity rate at 472 bolivars per dollar.</p>
<p>As of January 2, that central parity rate will depreciate by 1.32 percent per month within trading bands set 7.5 percent either side of the core rate, the Central Bank said in a paid notice taken out in the national press.  </p>
<p>&quot;The sliding core rate should be taken as an indicator of the average exchange rate expected to prevail through the year. However within the bands the exchange rate will reflect market conditions,&quot; the bank said in Sunday's notice.</p>
<p>When the bands system was first established in July, the Central Bank set the central rate at 470 bolivars per dollar with a monthly depreciation rate of 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>But firmed by large capital inflows the bolivar soon headed for the lower band leading many analysts to expect a change in the system: either a widening of the bands or a change in the core rate.  </p>
<p>The foreign exchange market was unmoved by the news.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a de facto recognition of what was already happening -- appreciation. We had all been expecting this for a while,&quot; said one trader. At midday the bolivar stood at 475.61/476.60/dollar.</p>
<p>The Bank said the new core rate was an average of the April to December exchange rate and that the tweaked system would continue to help bear down on inflationary expectations.</p>
<p>Analysts said the change reflected a continued strong bolivar policy which in turn suggested at most only subdued TEM rates rises at Tuesday's scheduled auction.</p>
