<headline>GOLD OUTLOOK--PROSPECTS LOOK GRIM DESPITE RALLY.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-11</dateline>

<p>Gold prices may have closed near their week's high in London last Friday but that has done little to change the outlook of many commentators and analysts.</p>
<p>They remain convinced that the value of the metal is heading lower despite some positive factors emerging recently.</p>
<p>And the market seems to be feel the same. &quot;I wish it would get down and test the lows (around $314 plumbed last month), then we can see what sort of buying it can pick up,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The market's diffidence apparently takes no regard of the world's largest importer, India, forecasting 500 tonnes of imports this year -- nearly 100 tonnes more than last year -- or several mine closures and producers buying back hedges to provide themselves with some exposure to anticipated higher prices.</p>
<p>The focus is locked on the central banks, and more specifically the reasoning behind the Reserve Bank of Australia's sale of two-thirds of its gold reserves announced early last month.</p>
<p>&quot;If a clear signal was needed then this was surely it. Central banks can no longer be depended upon to hold gold for ever. Gold is viewed as a poor investment, and central banks are likely to remain significant sellers of gold in the foreseeable future,&quot; said Tony Warwick-Ching in the CRU Precious Metals Monitor.</p>
<p>If that means prices remain low, then part of the balancing mechanism in the market will be cuts in production as mines at the tip of the cost curve shut down.</p>
<p>But as the Precious Metal Monitor stresses, the banks and institutions hold over 34,000 tonnes of the metal in their reserves, so even selling 10 percent annually for 10 years would be &quot;almost certainly enough to offset price-related falls in production&quot;.</p>
<p>Even the prospect of the low prices spurring demand -- already in evidence with an 82 percent rise in Dubai imports in the first six months to 308 tonnes -- will not necessarily do much to push up prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The ever-present threat of further producer hedging, fund selling, and central bank liquidation places an almost impenetrable ceiling on any rally into the $340-$360 range,&quot; said Warwick-Ching.</p>
<p>The same spectres haunt the downside, too. &quot;We expect gold to continue its gradual descent towards $300 during the coming weeks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch's London-based metals specialist Ted Arnold forecasts a $300-$330 range will cover most of the traded gold prices in the coming two months.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold prices in our strongly held opinion are moving sideways to lower for many months to come,&quot; said Arnold.</p>
<p>&quot;Rallies will increasingly be seen as forward selling opportunities by producers, funds, dealers and central banks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Arnold put the gold price's immediate downside objective at $300.00, followed by $280.00 and $250.00, which could be reached despite inevitable production cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;It will take a very long period of low prices before we see much if any significant capacity closures,&quot; he said, adding that hedging would keep high-cost operations &quot;chugging along nicely&quot;.</p>
