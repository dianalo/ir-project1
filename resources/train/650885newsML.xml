<headline>UK's Blair to sell family home over security fears.</headline>

<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair is selling his family home in the fashionable London district of Islington because of security considerations, his spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Blair and his lawyer wife Cherie had hoped to keep the four-storey, five-bedroomed house in which they lived with their three children before the Labour Party won a landslide election victory last month.</p>
<p>But security experts said the house would need major work to protect it from possible terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Newspapers reported an asking price for the house of 615,000 pounds ($1 million)</p>
<p>&quot;The family had hoped to stay in the house but it became clear that this was an unrealistic proposition because of the cost to the taxpayer of securing it against terorist attack allied to the inconvenience caused to people living in the area,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Blair and his family have already moved most of their belongings into Downing Street. But they have broken with tradition by living in the larger house at Number 11, rather than the cramped apartment over the prime minister's official residence at Number 10.</p>
