<p>Burmese police arrested 65 prostitutes and five pimps in downtown Rangoon in November and December in a crackdown on prostitution, official media reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Acting on information that pimps and prostitutes were active in the vicinity of Theingyi Market and on either side of Shwedagon Pagoda Road, where there are many night clubs and restaurants, police...have seized them,&quot; state-run newspapers reported.</p>
<p>They said action had been taken against those arrested, but did not give details.</p>
<p>Prostitution has been on the rise in some of Burma's major cities, where the world's oldest profession used to be virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>The rise in prostitution is often attributed to the hotel and tourism business, which has been growing steadily since the military government opened up the economy in 1988.</p>
<p>Some of the women involved in prostitution in downtown Rangoon recently told Reuters they were forced into it because of the high cost of living and scarcity of good-paying jobs.</p>
