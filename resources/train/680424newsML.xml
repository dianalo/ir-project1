<headline>CBOT soybeans end mixed, new crop falls on weather.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>Recent hot weather in the U.S. Midwest has improved the propects for the newly-planted soybean crop, and new crop contracts ended lower Monday as a result, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, we're focusing on supply rather demand, and more specifically on new crop,&quot; said Anne Frick, oilseed analyst with Prudential Securities. &quot;The crop looks like it's off to a very good start.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the weekend, high temperatures in the U.S. Midwest climbed into the 80s and 90s (degrees Fahrenheit), and forecasters were showing high temperatures in the 80s and rain for Tuesday as well.</p>
<p>July soybeans ended sharply higher after late commodity fund buying spooked local traders who covered an estimated two million bushels worth of short positions, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts also considered weekly export shipment data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as bullish for nearby futures.</p>
<p>&quot;To have double-digit exports at this time of year is really quite astounding,&quot; Frick said.</p>
<p>July soybeans ended 10 cents per bushel higher at $8.36 per bushel and other months were 1-1/4 up to 4-1/4 cents lower.  </p>
<p>USDA reported soybean export inspections of 10.022 million bushels. That figure exceeded trade expectations for 3.0 million to 7.0 million bushels.</p>
<p>January, March, May and new crop July soybeans made fresh contract lows on Monday.</p>
<p>On the day, LIT bought two million bushels July and sold two million bushels November. Refco bought 2.5 million November and one million July and Term Commodities bought one million November, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In options trade, Lind-Waldock sold 500 November $6.50 puts and Continental Grain bought 200 August $7.50 puts and sold 200 August $7.75 calls, traders said.</p>
<p>Soybean futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 58,000 contracts, exceeding Friday's actual volume of 50,878 contracts.</p>
