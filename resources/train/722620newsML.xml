<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the agency's forecast of an unexpectedly large winter wheat crop earlier Friday would lead to aggressive export sales, but he refused to say whether the department would reactivate its wheat export subsidy program.</p>
<p>&quot;It increases our desire to move this wheat as aggressively as we can,&quot; Glickman told reporters, referring to the 1.78 billion bushel crop estimate. That projection is up 11 percent from the USDA's previous forecast, and 20 percent higher than last year's crop.  </p>
<p>Glickman, speaking to reporters at a news conference to announce a rural housing program, also said he was &quot;concerned&quot; by a House appropriations committee proposal earlier this week to cut funding for the USDA's Export Enhancement Program to $205 million.</p>
<p>The Clinton Administration had sought $500 million in funding for the program next year, but Glickman acknowledged that the budget-writing committee had to juggle other needs.</p>
<p>&quot;If you're going to have it, you have to have it big enough to use as a reservoir,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In the current fiscal year, which ends in three months, congress budgeted just $10 million for the export subsidy program.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't put over-reliance on the EEP,&quot; he told USDA Radiio in a separate interview on Friday. &quot;It can effectively not be used (this fiscal year) because there are no resources,&quot; Glickman said.</p>
<p>Glickman declined to comment on whether the subsidy might be dusted off in the new fiscal year, saying it would depend on market conditions and subsidies used by competing countries.</p>
<p>He said projections of a big wheat harvest put additional pressure on the United States to export production.</p>
<p>&quot;It still requires us to move this grain on the export market as best we can,&quot; he said at the news conference. &quot;American wheat is the most competitive wheat in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Glickman confirmed the U.S. was considering renewing export subsidies for wheat flour and barley malt.</p>
<p>Glickman also said that slumping commodity prices could eventually prompt a congressional re-evaluation of the landmark Freedom to Farm bill passed last year.</p>
<p>&quot;If we see weak prices for a long time, lawmakers will want to re-evaluate but it's too early to do that now,&quot; he said.</p>
