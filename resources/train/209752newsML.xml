<p>An elite rescue team from Miami is among those with the grisly and dangerous task of trying to find survivors in the ruins of the building where 17 people were confirmed dead in an apparent gas blast.</p>
<p>About 70 were wounded and another 11 were believed to be buried in the mass of twisted metal and rubble in a shoe store on the ground floor of the six-floor Humberto Vidal Building. Hopes were fading on Friday that people might still be alive in the ruins.</p>
<p>Members of the Metro-Dade Fire Rescue FL Task Force One, veterans of the Oklahoma City bombing and disasters in Colombia, Armenia and the Phillipines, rushed to Puerto Rico as soon as the extent of the tragedy was known.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all rescue specialists,&quot; Chris Martindale, 24, of Pembroke Pines, Florida, said. &quot;We'll search for missing or trapped people.&quot; He and his colleagues, Jack Swerdloff, 24, of Kendall,and George Izquierda, 27, of Killian, were sitting on a curbside next to the shattered building, suited up and ready to go to work as engineers braced the building to make it safe for search crews to enter.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the grunts,&quot; Swerdloff said. Asked if they hoped to find anyone alive, he said, &quot;We have every reason to believe we will get something. We are looking for a void where people can be. If not, we'll stay to get the bodies for the families.&quot;</p>
<p>The 62-member task force includes dog sniffer teams, sensitive probing equipment, engineers, doctors and medics. It is one of 13 teams in the United States under the Federal Emergency Management Agency but one of only two with a mandate to help in overseas disasters.</p>
<p>Martindale and Swerdloff are veterans of the April 1995 truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, which resulted in the deaths of 168 people, many of them young children.</p>
<p>&quot;Personally, I think this is more dangerous,&quot; Swerdloff said. &quot;There's more fall hazards, more loose stuff. At Oklahoma, there was more sifting to do.&quot;</p>
<p>He acknowledged the work has a high emotional as well as a physical toll. &quot;It's different for everybody. At Oklahoma, there was a lot of dead kids. That was hard on the older guys...&quot;</p>
