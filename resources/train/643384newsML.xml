<headline>ANR says flows on US Gulf gas lines normal.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-06</dateline>

<p>ANR Pipeline Co, a unit of Coastal Corp, said Friday there was no evidence of a natural gas pipeline leak on its offshore Louisiana system and flows were normal.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no evidence that it's ours but we are continuing to investigate it. We shut the line in last night and experienced no pressure drop, but there are still bubbles visible,&quot; a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the U.S. Coast Guard ordered several lines in Vermilion Bay shut for testing after small bubbles were spotted in the water.</p>
<p>Acadian Gas Pipeline, Louisiana Resources, Sea Robin Pipeline and Texas Gas Transmission Corp each operate major lines in the area but checks early Friday showed no significant interruptions on any of those lines.</p>
<p>Traders said market rumors this morning pegged the source of the problem on an ANR line.</p>
<p>The ANR spokesman said the next step involved isolating the line, which is located in the Vermilion South Marsh Island area, and blowing it down to a low pressure to see if the bubbles disappear.</p>
<p>&quot;If the gas bubbles disappear, then it's ours. If they don't, then it's someone else's,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said about two to four million cubic feet per day of gas was flowing through the shut in line.</p>
<p>ANR's southeast mainline flowed 1.3 billion cubic feet per day yesterday and was still flowing at a similar rate today.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no impact on our operations,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
