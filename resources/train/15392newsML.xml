<p>The oil palm holdings of Tradewinds (M) Bhd will vastly rise now that it is part of the restructured Pernas International Holdings Bhd (PIHP), PIHP chairman Shahriman Tunku Sulaiman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Briefing analysts and reporters after the assets of the government's investment holding company Pernas were injected into PIHP last week, Shahriman said PIHP now holds 194,000 acres (78,500 hectares)</p>
<p>About 80 percent of it is cultivated and half of that is mature trees. The remaining 20 percent is to be planted, he said.</p>
<p>Tradewinds currently has 14,776 hectares of oil palm under cultivation, according to the company's 1996 annual report.</p>
<p>Asked if Tradewinds would be the vehicle for all of PIHP's oil palm holdings, Shahriman said: &quot;The major portion of the plantations will be in Tradewinds. But whether all the holdings will be in the company has not been decided.&quot;</p>
<p>Company officials at the briefing said one acre of mature oil palm trees yields nine tonnes of palm oil and about 1,000 ringgit in profit.  </p>
<p>Shahriman said PIHP had plans as well for refining and marketing palm oil, of which Malaysia is the largest producer and exporter.</p>
<p>He said the company was in the final stages of negotiations with a cosmetics firm to sell palm oil as a base for cosmetics.</p>
<p>Asked if that company was Avon Products Inc, he said: &quot;That's a very good guess&quot;, adding that Avon was moving aggressively into the Asia market, particularly in China.</p>
<p>Tradewinds' Central Sugar Refinery Sdn Bhd -- the main contributor to the company's earnings in 1995 -- will also see expansion under the restructuring.</p>
<p>Company officials said at the briefing they plan to increase capacity to 2,000 tonnes a day from 1,200 tonnes.</p>
