<p>Competition commissioner Karel Van Miert wants to probe a four-year exclusive broadcast rights deal between satellite broadcaster BSkyB and Britain's Football Association (FA), BBC radio said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But in Brussels, Van Miert said a distinction had to be made between formal investigations and the need to monitor all such deals. No formal investigation was underway involving BSkyB, he said.</p>
<p>In an interview broadcast on BBC radio, Van Miert said: &quot;We have to look into the (BSkyB-FA) deal and also the duration of the contract.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked by the programme if he would intervene in the deal he replied, &quot;We certainly will. We certainly will. And what should not happen is that those acquiring the rights will be in such a dominant position that they are going to impose the rules.&quot;</p>
<p>BSkyB sealed a 670 million pound ($1.07 billion) contract in June this year to buy the rights to transmit live all FA Premier League soccer matches for the next four years.</p>
<p>Last month Van Miert signalled his concern over long-term deals involving ever-larger sums of money in submissions to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;There is this trend which seriously worries us that increasingly a few large groups can buy such (sports broadcasting) rights,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In August the Commission launched a probe into a plan by the Dutch soccer association KNVB to give a new TV channel called Sport 7, which it partly owns, exclusive rights for seven years over premier and first division matches.</p>
<p>In a statement issued in Brussels commenting on the BBC report Van Miert drew a distinction between KNVB and BSkyB.</p>
<p>&quot;...a formal investigation is presently underway as to the Dutch sports channel, especially as regards the seven-year duration of the contract, and not as far as the BSkyB-Premiership league is concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;As to the BSkyB-Premiership contract, Mr Van Miert said that this is part of a more general monitoring exercise related to the overall phenonomenon of exclusive rights on sports events,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>No one was immediately available at BSkyB. ($1=.6285 Pound)</p>
