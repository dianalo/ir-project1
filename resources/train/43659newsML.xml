<headline>Santander, Inverlat said in deal.</headline>

<p>Spain's Banco Santander SA has signed a letter of intent with Mexico's Grupo Financiero Inverlat SA de CV to set up a pension fund manager known as Afore, bank sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been having conversations for several weeks and they've borne fruit.  We want a marriage but we haven't decided who puts in what,&quot; an Inverlat source said.</p>
<p>Santander officials confirmed an unspecified deal was being struck with Inverlat.  </p>
<p>&quot;We can confirm there has been a letter of intent signed with Inverlat...I can speak very little about this other than to say it has a 50/50 intention,&quot; a New York spokesman for Santander told Reuters.  He said he was barred from saying anything else until the contract was signed.</p>
<p>The Inverlat source said the letter of intent was signed on Monday.  He said the Mexican bank, in which Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia has a majority stake, has about five percent of the total accounts in the Retirement Savings System (SAR), which is the current government-run pension fund plan.</p>
<p>That makes it the bank with the fourth largest pension accounts in Mexico, he said. It also has about 330 bank branches throughout Mexico, which Santander would find attractive for distribution purposes.</p>
<p>Next year, the government is allowing privately-run Afores for the first time, and Mexican and foreign banks are currently in a scramble to set up partnerships to take advantage of what is expected to be a booming market.</p>
