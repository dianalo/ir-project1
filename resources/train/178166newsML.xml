<p>Confusion reigned in the small foregn community in the Afghan capital of Kabul on Saturday after the Taleban administration seemingly ordered all foreigners to stay in one designated hotel.</p>
<p>A statement read out on Kabul's Taleban-controlled radio station on Friday night said all foreign tourists and journalists were obliged to stay in the Continental Hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;The hotel management requests that foreign guests, such as journalists and other foreign nationals staying in ... rented accommodation, should contact the Continental Hotel,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are not allowed to stay anywhere else.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign journalists have poured into Kabul since it fell to the fundamentalist Taleban militia on September 27.</p>
<p>Officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism said the statement had been issued by the Continental Hotel, and cleared for broadcast by the deputy head of the Taleban's interim ruling council in Kabul, Mullah Mohammed Hssan.</p>
<p>But the acting deputy minister of Civil Aviation and tourism said the situation was still unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;The case has been referred to the foreign ministry for finalisation. It will take some time for us to make a final announcement on the matter,&quot; said Mullah Hamdullah, the acting deputy minister.</p>
<p>Under previous administrations had required all foreign journalists and tourists to stay in accommodation registered by the foreign ministry. But that law was frequently ignored.</p>
<p>Mullah Hamdullah told Reuters on Saturday, &quot;No journalist has the right to stay with irrelevant non-governmental organisations or in private accommodation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first aim of Taleban policy regarding journalists and tourists accommmodation is to establish Taleban control over journalist's security arrangements,&quot; said Hamdullah.</p>
<p>&quot;The second objective is to strengthen the economy of the hotel,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mohammed Arif, who runs the German Club, a rival hostelry that is the accommodation of choice for visiting journalists, said that he believed the statement was unofficial.</p>
<p>Arif said the Club is registered with the foreign ministry. None of the journalists staying there on Saturday said they intended to move until the situation was clarified.</p>
<p>The Continental -- formerly the Intercontinental -- Hotel was once the queen of Afghanistan's hotels, but is now a sorry shadow of its former self. Shells and rockets have extensively damaged one side and only 85 of its 200 rooms are habitable.</p>
