<p>The European Commission is seeking comments on a European digital pay-radio business operated by Sony Digital Radio Europe Ltd, which is ultimately owned by Japan's Sony Corp, and Time Warner MCE Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>The pay-radio business, called Music Choice Europe Company, programmes around 60 channels of top quality, non-stop, music for distribution to homes across Europe, the Commission said in a notice published in the EU's Official Journal of March 6.</p>
<p>The channels are currently transmitted via cable operators. But they are expected to be made available to customers through satellite broadcasting direct to home &quot;in the near future&quot;, the Commission said in the notice.</p>
<p>Music Choice is based on a partnership agreement between Sony and the Time Warner subsidiary as well as the British unit of General Instrument Corp, Digital Cable Radio Europe and AEI Music Network Inc. It was set up in December 1993 and has a duration of 40 years.</p>
<p>The partners are to launch a second service called AEI Music Choice consisting of four channels for business customers.</p>
<p>The partnership deal is concerned with funding of start-up expenses, technology arrangements and for providing technical and administrative services, the Commission said. It called on interested parties to make comments.</p>
<p>The deal was submitted to the Commission's competition watchdog for clearance in June 1996 under EU rules which ban restrictive practices or abuse of dominant positions. There is no deadline to rule on cases falling under such rules. -- Brussels newsroom 322 2876841</p>
