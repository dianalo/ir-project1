<p>Belgian first division club Aalst faces allegations of attempted bribery to fix matches, Belgian soccer union prosecutor Rene Verstringhe said on Friday.</p>
<p>The union's controlling committee, which is considering the allegations, will announce its decision on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Aalst were prominent relegation candidates in late March when they were 17th in the 18-team table, eight points behind 16th-placed Mechelen.</p>
<p>But they staged a remarkable comeback to finish the season two months later in 15th place, five points clear of Mechelen, who were relegated with Cercle Brugge.</p>
<p>Aalst won four of their last six league games and drew the two others. In the previous 28 rounds they had won just four matches and lost 14.</p>
<p>Aalst attributed the turnaround largely to a change of coach earlier this year.</p>
<p>Verstringhe, a leading Belgian lawyer who became prosecutor for the union three years ago, has called for Aalst to be fined up to 1.75 million francs ($49,000) and its manager Patrick Orlans to be suspended for a year.</p>
<p>He also demanded a one-year suspension for a former Aalst youth coach, alleged by players from other clubs who gave evidence to the committee to have acted as an intermediary for Aalst.</p>
<p>&quot;If (the committee) accepts that the club was involved in attempted bribery then it must be relegated, according to the rules,&quot; Verstringhe said.</p>
<p>Aalst manager Orlans told BRTN radio he was convinced that charges against the club would be dropped.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course the union prosecutors are our opponents who are claiming a number of things but I still think it is all hardly convincing...there is no direct trace to Aalst, no evidence,&quot; Orlans said. ($ = 35.7 Belgian francs)</p>
