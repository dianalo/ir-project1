<p>Hong Kong's stock market went into the last week before Chinese rule on a rollercoaster, soaring to new heights on Monday and quickly plunging again.</p>
<p>With five working days to go before Britain hands Hong Kong back to China, the Hang Seng Index gained more than one percent to reach a record new high of 15,322.33 shortly after opening.</p>
<p>The gains were then promptly wiped out by profit-taking. But analysts said the market, which made its biggest-ever one-day gain on Friday, was still strong with money flowing in from mainland China to the world's seventh largest trading economy.</p>
<p>Outgoing governor Chris Patten said Britain was handing back Hong Kong to China in superb economic shape -- and warned his successor Tung Chee-hwa not to be an autocrat.</p>
<p>&quot;In Hong Kong, there is no one who has absolute power,&quot; Britain's 28th and last governor told the Chinese-language paper Ming Pao in an interview marking the end of 156 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>After their summit in Denver, the Group of Seven industrialised nations also called on China to maintain its commitment to respect Hong Kong's freedoms.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole world will be watching very carefully,&quot; said President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Business was bullish as the capitalist enclave of 6.4 million people -- widely hailed as the world's freest marketplace -- prepared to be taken over by the communist giant.</p>
<p>An overwhelming 92 percent of executives polled at a Far Eastern Economic Review conference said they were positive. The survey also revealed that maintaining a democratic system was ranked as the least important factor for Hong Kong's economic well-being.</p>
<p>Larry Yung, the influential &quot;red princeling&quot; who runs CITIC Pacific -- the Hong Kong branch of China's official foreign trading arm -- warned Beijing that Hong Kong's economic miracle would end if China abandoned the separate development formula planned for the next 50 years.</p>
<p>&quot;If Beijing were to try to move the system in China to Hong Kong, then 'one country, two systems' would be gone and that would be the end of Hong Kong,&quot; he told Time magazine.</p>
<p>Former shipping magnate Tung extended an olive branch to democrat activists who have mocked him as a Beijing puppet and promised to stage handover protests.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope those in the democratic camp will move on with us,&quot; Tung told the South China Morning Post.</p>
<p>But he has stressed that new laws restricting demonstrations would take effect from the minute the territory becomes part of China on the stroke of midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>The Royal Yacht Britannia sailed into Hong Kong harbour on a grey and wet Monday morning, marking the beginning of the end of the last major British colony.</p>

<p>Organisers promised &quot;there won't be a dry eye in the house&quot; at next Monday's sunset ceremony that lowers the curtain on British rule east of Suez.</p>
