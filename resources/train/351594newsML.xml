<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss purchasing index shows industrial expansion.</title>
<headline>Swiss purchasing index shows industrial expansion.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-02-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Swiss Purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.2 percent from a revised 44.2 percent in December, the first time since February 1996 the PMI indicated a slight expansion in Swiss industry.</p>
<p>The improvement in the index, which is compiled by Credit Suisse and the Swiss Association for Material Management and Purchasing (SVME), is mainly due to rises in the sub-indicies for production and order levels.</p>
<p>Apart from the employment index, all sub-indicies rose with production, orders-on-hand, purchasing volume and purchasing prices rising above the critical 50 percent level.</p>
<p>The production index, which showed the strongest rise, was partially due to a higher number of working days. An increase in purchasing prices was also affected by the weaker Swiss franc.</p>
<p>The Swiss PMI, published since September 1995, is based on surveys in which companies are asked to rate each sub-index as higher, lower or unchanged from the month before.</p>
