<p>Australian Industry Minister John Moore said on Thursday the government would provide A$520 million in funding over the next four years to help companies with their research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure.</p>
<p>The funding was budgeted for in the government's August 30 budget with A$40 million of the total to be available in the 1996/97 fiscal year regardless of whether parliament approves an offsetting cut in a R&amp;D tax break.</p>
<p>&quot;It overcomes the flaws in the previous system of syndications, in which the focus was more on financial outcomes rather than R&amp;D outcomes,&quot; Moore told reporters.  </p>
<p>However, he said the remaining A$480 million was conditional on the successful passage of the government's R&amp;D tax break legislation through the non-government dominated upper house, the Senate. Companies can currently deduct 150 percent of R&amp;D spending from their taxable income, but the government wants to cut this to 125 percent.</p>
<p>The Labor opposition is opposed to the change, while the Australian Democrats have said they are open to negotiations.</p>
<p>The government needs two non-government votes to pass any legislation in the Senate.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think that the outcome in the Senate is by no means set in cement,&quot; Moore said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're having discussions with various parties and may find different voting patterns on different subjects.&quot;</p>
<p>Moore said the government currently spent about A$3.5 billion a year on R&amp;D.</p>
