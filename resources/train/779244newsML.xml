<p>Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were little changed and confined to narrow trading bands at midday Tuesday, mimicking the Treasury market's tone before the $38 billion refunding got under way.</p>
<p>MBS yield spreads above Treasuries remained stable after widening in recent weeks on escalated prepayment fears, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know if the market sentiment has changed, but people are more comfortable owning&quot; a broader spectrum of MBS after Friday's rate surge quelled some prepayment worries, said a trader of adjustable-rate mortgage securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of people still reeling from Friday's employment report. They are trying to understand the data and the decline in Treasury prices,&quot; said William Gooch, vice president at Legg Mason Wood Walker. He added that investors who were concerned about prepayments prior to the report may now be reconsidering a move out of mortgages or down-in-coupon.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people are in a wait-and-see mode,&quot; said Gooch, noting that investor enthusiasm about the auction of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds will affect MBS spreads.</p>
