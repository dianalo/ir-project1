<p>British doctors praised a new drug offering the first hope of helping Alzheimer's patients on Friday, but stressed it was not a cure and sufferers should not have unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>The drug, Aricept, has been licensed by Britain's Medicines Control Agency for use in those with mild to moderate forms of the disease, about 200,000 of the estimated 400,000 Alzheimer's sufferers in Britain. It becomes available next week.</p>
<p>The manufacturers, Japan's Eisai Co Ltd, hope to launch the drug in Germany later this year and France in 1998. They hope for $300 million in sales over five years.</p>
<p>Aricept (donepezil) has been found to help improve symptoms of dementia in some cases of Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Approved last November by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is the first drug to be licensed in Europe for treating the incurable dementia since it was identified 90 years ago.</p>
<p>Another drug, approved in the United States in 1993 but not in Europe, is Warner-Lambert's Tacrine (cognex). It slows the progress of Alzheimer's in some patients, but has some side-effects in the liver that Aricept doesn't.</p>
<p>&quot;It is representing a sea change ... for carers and clinicians throughout the country,&quot; Dr Roy Jones of the Research Institute for the Care of the Elderly in Bath, told reporters.</p>
<p>Tests on a variety of scales show the drug can, in some cases, help Alzheimer's patients think and understand more clearly, and can help them move about better.</p>
<p>Jones, who has worked with the drug in trials, described the case of one Alzheimer's victim whose wife had a flat tyre on her car.</p>
<p>&quot;Her husband noticed the flat tyre, which surprised her,&quot; he said. Even more surprising - he was able to change it, a task his wife did not think he would have been able to do before he started taking the drug.</p>
<p>&quot;These things are anecdotal but life is anecdotal,&quot; Jones said. &quot;It's an exciting moment when hope is starting to turn into reality.&quot;</p>
<p>But Jones and other experts warned the drug was no cure, and said it would have to be discontinued in patients once their disease progressed - as it always does - into the severe stages.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not something that's going to affect disease progression or be a cure,&quot; warned Dr Paul Hooper, medical director for Eisai in Europe. It could, however, improve quality of life for some patients and those who care for them, and keep others out of nursing homes.</p>
<p>Eisai, which has an agreement with Pfizer Inc to market the drug, estimates it will cost 1,000 pounds ($1,600) per patient per year.</p>
<p>The drug is a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Neurotransmitters carry signals between brain cells and acetylcholine is associated with cognitive functions such as memory, learning and judgement.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the worse someone is suffering from Alzheimer's, the lower their levels of acetylcholine. The idea behind Aricept is to make more acetylcholine available.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's affects two to three percent of people over 65, or more than four million Americans. It is the fourth most common cause of death in late life.</p>
