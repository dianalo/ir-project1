<p>Visiting Cambodian co-Defence Minister Tea Chamras, aligned to First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, said on Sunday there was still a chance of a political settlement to the fighting between the rival prime ministers' forces in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Forces loyal to Ranariddh were exchanging shell and rifle fire with those of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen for the second day on Sunday in the Cambodian capital. Thousands were fleeing the city, witnesses said.</p>
<p>At least four people have been killed and 20 wounded.</p>
<p>Tea Chamras said he had talked to co-Defence Minister Tea Bann, from Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;He told me that we can still negotiate to settle the problem by political means,&quot; Tea Chamras said.</p>
<p>The minister came to Bangkok on Friday. He has been unable to return to Phnom Penh because the airport is closed. He insisted that he would return by Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I will definitely go back to Phnom Penh. I have no reason to stay in Thailand,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation in my country is like flooding. When the water recedes everything will be back to normal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ranariddh, who is in France, has accused Hun Sen of launching a coup in his absence.</p>
<p>A radio station loyal to Hun Sen on Sunday denied the charge and said that if it were a coup, Ranariddh's party ministers and officials would have been arrested.</p>
