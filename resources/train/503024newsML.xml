<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen said on Friday that tension over a hunger crisis in North Korea could spark a new Korean war &quot;virtually without notice.&quot;</p>
<p>On his return from visits to Japan and South Korea, he told reporters that recent North Korean tank and troop movements did not appear to be threatening, but they might be aimed at quashing unrest among civilians, reported to be suffering near-famine conditions.  </p>
<p>Cohen said the United States and South Korea hoped that high-level North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop, who is temporarily in the Philippines, would soon move to South Korea and provide insight into the state of mind of Pyongyang's military and government.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a variety of reasons why they (North Korean forces) may have done this,&quot; including routine training, he said. &quot;It may be to send a signal to any rebellious citizens. We just simply don't have any access into their mindset. Maybe the defector will give us an insight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very dangerous area that could erupt virtually without notice. They have a lot of chemical weapons. They have lots of Scuds,&quot; Cohen told reporters flying home with him from South Korea at the end of a week-long Pacific-Asian trip.</p>
<p>&quot;They (North Korea) could do some horrific damage in a short time. They would be devastated in return, but you're dealing with a regime that doesn't always act in a rational fashion, so you have to be very cautious in your dealings with them.&quot;</p>
