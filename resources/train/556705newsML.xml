<headline>BELGIAN CAPITAL-GUARANTEED FUNDS' VOLUME MUSHROOMS.</headline>

<p>Belgian capital-guaranteed index funds continued their meteoric rise in the first quarter of 1997, seeing total volume swell to 207.6 billion francs at the end of March 1997, from 161.9 billion at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>At the end of March 1996, there was 76.7 billion francs outstanding in capital guaranteed funds, the Belgian Association of Investment Funds (BIAF) said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>The enormous succes of these no-risk funds is one of the most notable features of the Belgian fund industry -- they were first launched in 1993, when their total volume outstanding was just 13.7 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Capital guaranteed index funds are very popular in Belgium, people are always looking for security,&quot; Annemie Roppe, secretary-general of the BIAF told Reuters.</p>
<p>Capital-guaranteed index funds guarantee investors that they will pay back at least the amount invested plus part of the rise of the stock market index they are linked to.</p>
<p>Fed up with the current low interest rates, risk-averse Belgian investors flocked to these new instruments in droves in the past year.</p>
<p>Of the 207.6 billion outstanding, 92 billion was invested in funds linked to the Belgian share index, 107.8 billion in funds linked to a foreign share index and 7.8 billion in currency-index funds.</p>
<p>Capital-guaranteed funds now represent 8.66 percent of the industry's total volume outstanding, which was 2,397.5 billion francs at the end of March 1997, from 2,253.4 billion at the end of 19996 and 2009.6 billion at the end of March 1996.</p>
<p>The association said that volume growth was mainly due to the succes of capital guaranteed funds and equity funds.</p>
<p>Funds which do not invest in fixed-income instruments (such as share funds, index funds, pension funds and real estate funds) now represent 41.1 percent of the market, compared to 32.4 percent a year ago.</p>
