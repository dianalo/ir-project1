<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</title>
<headline>S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-01-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>South African bonds ended mostly steady on Wednesday after a healthy consolidation following big moves on the downside at the start of the week, bond dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expected a reasonable retracement, possibly back up to the 15.95 percent level but the market was well supported at the 15.93 percent level,&quot; a senior trader said.</p>
<p>He said most technical indicators had turned positive, referring to slightly easier money market rates and a healthier rand.</p>
<p>The market was awaiting the release of December reserves data, due out at 1600 GMT on Wednesday after the official close, for direction.</p>
<p>A Reuters consensus poll of seven economists forecast reserves would decline to 10.85 billion rand after rising to 10.93 billion rand in November from October's rise to 10.28 billion rand.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the positive undertone, the market could ignore a slightly negative figure,&quot; the trader commented.</p>
<p>A cause for concern was the weaker U.S. bond market. The local market was seen dented by U.S. rates if the 30-year bond lost substantial ground the next few days.</p>
<p>The U.S. market has been weighed down by fears of stronger economic growth which could trigger an interest rate hike.</p>
<p>The benchmark R150 bond was last at 15.90 percent from 15.93 percent late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bond Exchange figures which showed foreigners were net sellers of South African bonds on Tuesday to the tune of 52.38 million rand after buying 62.25 million rands worth of bonds on Monday.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative turnover was 6.01 billion rand on Tuesday from 2.80 billion rand on Monday, the exchange said.</p>
<p>The rand ended an uneventful day near its previous closing levels and was seen taking its cue from the bond market early on Thursday.</p>
<p>The unit ended the day at 4.6685/6735 on the dollar from 4.6630/6680 late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been very quiet. Importer demand pushed the rand to around the 4.68 level during the course of the day but nothing of note happened,&quot; a forex trtader said.</p>
<p>He expected a 4.66 to 4.68 range on Thursday.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the rand was last trading firmer at 7.8685/8816 on sterling from 7.9072/9203 late on Tuesday and at 0.3365/3370 on the mark from 0.3340/3345 previously.</p>
<p>On the money market, the daily market shortage held below the ten billion rand mark at 9.686 billion rand on Tuesday from 9.499 billion rand on Monday, the Reserve Bank said.</p>
<p>Three-month NCD rates extended their downward trend, moving lower to between 17.35 and 17.65 percent from 17.35 and 17.75 percent on Tuesday while the 90-day BA rate was steady at between 16.65 and 16.95 percent.</p>
