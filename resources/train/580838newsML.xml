<title>PHILIPPINES: Manila shares inch up at close in light trade.</title>

<p>Manila shares ended a shade up on Tuesday after see-saw trading as losses of most B shares were slightly offset by gains of index heavyweight Metrobank, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is consolidating and we are welcoming back Mr. Volatility,&quot; said Kenneth Nerecina, research head at Vickers Ballas Securities Phils Inc.</p>
<p>Turnover was a thin 1.95 billion pesos.  </p>
<p>In the broader market, bears overpowered bulls with 69 decliners against 57 gainers.</p>
<p>Joey Roxas, president at Eagle Equities Inc said reports of foreign investors being allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to own A shares reserved for Filipinos caused the selloff in Manila Electric Co (Meralco) B shares.</p>
<p>Foreigners are limited to buying Class B shares.</p>
<p>Meralco opened at an intra-day low of 100 pesos from the previous 120 but recovered by the close at 112 pesos. It was the most heavily traded issue.</p>
<p>During trading, the SEC made no official comment on foreigners being allowed to own A shares.</p>
<p>But after the session, SEC executive director Eugenio Reyes told Reuters that foreigners in theory have have been able to purchase A shares since the late 1980s by using a Philippine-owned fund.</p>
<p>&quot;But it's not simple. An arrangement has to be made with a trustee bank with Filipino owners and voting rights, as well as ownership of the B shares, will be maintained by the trustee bank,&quot; said Reyes.</p>
