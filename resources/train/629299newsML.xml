<p>Arab land dealers out to make a fast buck have become the latest casualties of a long-running turf war between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>Three of them have been killed and dumped on roadsides in less than a month since Palestinian leaders banned land sales to Jews on penalty of death.</p>
<p>Israel said on Sunday that the Palesinian Authority was behind at least two of the killings. &quot;There is solid evidence that one of the Palestinian intelligence branches is responsible for the two cases,&quot; police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin told Reuters.</p>
<p>She said Israeli police arrested six Palestinians who were trying to abduct an Arab land dealer in the Jerusalem area on Saturday. Four of the six work for a branch of Palestinian security, she said.</p>
<p>The scramble by both Israelis and Palestinians to &quot;establish facts on the ground&quot; in the form of property has gained urgency as the time to draw borders in a final peace agreement approaches.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we are waging a war in Jerusalem over who buys more land and who can better fortify his position,&quot; said Evyatar Cohen of El-Ad, an Israeli group dedicated to buying land from Palestinians in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>El-Ad and other groups largely funded by Jews abroad work clandestinely with Arab brokers to seek out Palestinians willing to part with their homes or their land in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, areas Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>The final status of East Jerusalem is to be settled by 1999 according to a framework 1993 peace accord but final negotiations have yet to start in earnest.</p>
<p>The brokers help to negotiate secret multi-million dollar deals which in some cases include arrangements to fly Palestinian sellers out of the area to escape any retribution.</p>
<p>&quot;We at the Palestinian Authority see this death penalty against land dealers as legal,&quot; said an Information Ministry statement issued after face of criticism by the United States and human rights groups of the policy.</p>
<p>&quot;It meets our national goals which are aimed at protecting our land which Israel is trying to steal from us with help from these land dealers,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The ban on Palestinian land sales was announced weeks after Israel began building a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, plunging peace negotiations into crisis.</p>
<p>Israel has described the ban as racist and linked it to the land dealer killings, a charge the Palestinian Authority denies. It says it will try offenders in its courts, not subject them to summary execution.</p>
<p>&quot;This is nonsense, the Authority is not involved in the killing of those dealers, brokers, traitors,&quot; Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medeen told reporters in self-ruled Gaza. &quot;I accuse the Israelis and I'm sure there is a finger of an Israeli in the killing.&quot;</p>
