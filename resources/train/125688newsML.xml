<p>Marcus Allen scored two touchdowns and Pete Stoyanovich had a pair of field goals as the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Seattle Seahawks, 34-16 in an AFC Western Division matchup Thursday.</p>
<p>Allen scored the 108th and 109th rushing touchdowns of his career. He has six this season, tying Miami's Karim Abdul-Jabbar for the AFC lead. Allen missed most of the second half with a bruised right hip.</p>
<p>Kansas City's Steve Bono completed 17-of-26 passes for 194 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>Third-year wide receiver Chris Penn had one of his best games as a pro with five receptions for 69 yards. Penn, who had just four catches in his career entering 1996, leads the team with 25 receptions.</p>
<p>The Chiefs (5-2) took a 3-0 lead on their first possession when Bono moved them 51 yards in nine plays, culminating with a 45-yard field goal by Stoyanovich. Bono found Penn for a 16-yard completion just before the kick.</p>
<p>Kimble Anders' 15-yard scoring run with 3:41 left in the quarter pushed the advantage to 10-0.</p>
<p>Allen's first score of the game came with 3:47 left in the half and extended the Chiefs lead to 17-0. The 13-play, 81-yard drive chewed up more than eight minutes and featured a pair of offsides penalties by the Seahawks, each in 3rd-and-short situations.</p>
<p>The Seahawks (2-5) finally got on the board with 26 seconds left in the half when John Friesz directed a 14-play drive that was capped by Todd Peterson's 24-yard field goal.</p>
<p>Friesz was 20-for-34 for 238 yards with an interception and a touchdown.</p>
<p>But the Chiefs answered before the half ended. Kansas City took over on its 32 and used the two-minute offence to perfection to move the ball into field-goal range and Stoyanovich converted a 43-yard attempt as time expired for a 20-3 halftime advantage.</p>
<p>The Seahawks capitalised on a Greg Hill fumble early in the third quarter to halve the deficit.</p>
<p>Allen cashed in another touchdown, again from one yard out. Bono directed an 11-play drive that saw Allen convert a key 3rd-and-1. That run and the touchdown burst were Allen's only carries of the second half. But the score, with 21 seconds left in the third quarter, pushed the Chiefs' lead to 27-10.</p>
<p>LaChapelle added a four-yard touchown reception midway through the fourth quarter for the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Friesz capped the scoring with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway with 61 seconds left in the game.</p>
