<p>Britain's water industry regulator fired a warning shot at sector &quot;fatcats&quot; on Thursday, slamming excessive dividends and threatening price cuts.</p>
<p>But OFWAT's broadside fell far short of what the market had feared and relieved investors pumped funds into the sector's shares, pushing some leading companies up over four percent.</p>
<p>OFWAT's head Ian Byatt told a news conference he was considering a one-off price cut at his next industry review due in 1999 and that companies must rethink what he called their &quot;unsustainable&quot; dividend payouts.</p>
<p>&quot;The water companies are paying dividends which are growing faster than profits...This is unwise. It will have to stop,&quot; Byatt said.</p>
<p>Byatt suggested annual dividends should rise by between nought and two percent plus inflation and said companies should &quot;examine their consciences&quot;.</p>
<p>Britain's newly-privatised water companies have been savaged for pumping funds into hefty dividend payouts, sometimes rising by around 20 percent, while complaints about water stoppages and leaks have soared.</p>
<p>The newly-elected Labour government has seized on that public outrage and has threatened a windfall tax on privatised companies' profits and tougher regulation.</p>
<p>But details have been sketchy and the spectre of the tax -- once speculated to be as high as 10 billion pounds ($16.6 billion) but now closer to half that -- has dwindled in investors' minds.</p>
<p>Market players were given a further fillip by Byatt sidestepping the critical issue of the levy, saying only it was a matter for Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and his budget on July 2.</p>
<p>&quot;People were looking at whether Byatt would do anything on dividends. The answer is, long on words, short on action. And the windfall tax has been kicked into touch,&quot; Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Yamaichi in London, said.</p>
<p>&quot;The key thing is there are various suggestions in the press that the windfall tax may be only three billion pounds. And if British Telecommunications Plc have to pay a central chunk of that, then it is good news for water and electricity,&quot; Hawkins said.</p>
<p>Among leading shares, Anglian Water Plc gained 28-1/2p to 677p and Thames Water Plc, lambasted for one of the country's worst records on leaks, was up 22p at 675p.</p>
<p>Byatt has been a staunch critic of water firms' dividend increases, arguing that hefty payouts could undermine urgently-needed investment programmes. He said water quality would form a major pillar of the next review.</p>
<p>Byatt said he was considering a new approach to funding to ensure companies could only raise revenue from customers to meet obligations on quality after they had delivered them.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, customers are paying for such improvements while the work is underway, contrary to normal commercial practice,&quot; Byatt said.</p>
<p>He said OFWAT was examining ways to ensure consumers were more conscious about saving water, possibly through companies' tariff structures.</p>
