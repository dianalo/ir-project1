<p>Zairean rebel representatives on Thursday extended a demand for a freeze on assets of embattled ruler Mobutu Sese Seko to the United States, France and Belgium a day after Switzerland agreed to consider a similar request.</p>
<p>Three exiled opponents of Mobutu representing the rebels, flanked by a Swiss lawyer, also told a news conference that they regretted Switzerland's &quot;hypocrisy&quot; over Mobutu's wealth.</p>
<p>&quot;We want justice to be done. We urge the United States to set an example to the world and take measures to freeze Mobutu's funds,&quot; said rebel legal representative Ghislain Demofike.</p>
<p>&quot;This demand will also be extended to France and Belgium, and to other countries including Portugal and Austria.&quot;</p>
<p>The cancer-stricken Mobutu is reputedly one of the world's richest men, also with a string of luxury homes in a range of countries including France and Switzerland where he owns a villa in Lausanne valued at more than $2.5 million.</p>
<p>His wealth in secret Swiss bank accounts is estimated by the Swiss media at some $4 billion, although some bankers say his aides may be trying to get out fast any money he may have here.</p>
<p>The rebel representatives said they delivered the request to Switzerland to freeze Mobutu's funds, signed by the prosecutor of the city of the rebel-held city of Lumumbashi, in person to Swiss prosecutor general Carla del Ponte on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said they had evidence of alleged corruption and embezzlement by Mobutu and witnesses including the director of a Zairean mining company to prove their case but gave no details.</p>
<p>Swiss government, under pressure from a public losing patience with its banks' dealings with potentially dirty money, took the unusual step of annoucing the request on Wednesday and said it would study it.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila asked Switzerland in March to freeze Mobutu's wealth, but the government said at the time that any such request must come from official Zairean authorities.</p>
<p>This time, rebel representatives said they were taking no chances and claimed they were doing everything by the book.</p>
<p>They produced a government decree signed by a Mobutu minister appointing the prosecutor of Lumumbashi in 1995. They said he was legitimate, although he now supported the rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;The Swiss government, with a certain hypocrisy, had declared that it will not proceed with a blockage of Mobutu's assets until it received an official request,&quot; said one of the rebel representatives, Jose Mutombo-Kady.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, it is official. We demand an urgent provisional blockage of funds to stop the money leaving Swiss banks. We believe all conditions for this demand are in place,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu is still president, but the prosecutor of Lumumbashi is also a legitimate prosecutor.&quot;</p>
<p>Official Swiss sources said the government may consider a freeze on Mobutu's assets if it establishes that the Lumumbashi prosecutor's demand was legitimate.</p>
<p>One source said the Lumumbashi prosecutor appeared to be a legitimate official because he had been appointed by Mobutu, but added the decision would ultimately be a political one.</p>
<p>It may be some time before a decision comes from the Swiss government, ever cautious and anxious of the potential impact of a blockage of Mobutu's wealth while delicate talks are being brokered by South Africa between the president and Kabila.</p>
