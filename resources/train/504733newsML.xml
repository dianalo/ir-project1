<title>TAJIKISTAN: Fighting around Tajik aluminium town kills six.</title>
<headline>Fighting around Tajik aluminium town kills six.</headline>

<p>At least six people were killed on Friday in a gun battle around Tajikistan's aluminium producing town of Tursunzade, officials in the former Soviet republic said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Two militia officers and four civilians were killed,&quot; Amirkul Azimov, secretary of Tajikistan's policy-making Security Council, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said government forces had fended off an attack by warlord Kabir Abdullayev, who was trying to retake Tursunzade after losing control of the town last year.</p>
<p>A Tajik government officer connected to the fighting, who requested anonymity, said the death toll could be much higher, maybe up to 25 people.</p>
<p>A local official in the town reached by telephone said Tursunzade was quiet on Saturday.</p>
<p>In recent months, armed gangs have regularly attacked Tursunzade, 70 km (50 miles) west of Dushanbe, in bids by the country's myriad armed bands to control a large aluminium smelter there.</p>
<p>There was no word on whether production was affected although the smelter has usually continued to operate at about half of its 500,000-tonne per year capacity during similar clashes.</p>
<p>Tajikistan, which borders Afghanistan and China, is trying to emerge from a bloody four-year civil war.</p>
