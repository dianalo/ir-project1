<p>The delisting of Hungarian Global TH Rt from the Budapest Stock Exchange will not affect the expansion plans for the retailer, majority-owned by UK-based Tesco Plc, company officials said.</p>
<p>Tesco, which holds more than 96 percent of food retailer Global via its Netherlands-based subsidiary Cheshunt Overseas Finance BV, on Monday made a buyout offer for Global shareholders at 2,100 forints or 7.48 pounds per share.</p>
<p>The company and Creditanstalt Securities, which helps Tesco in the transaction, told a news conference that the move was aimed at reducing administrative costs.</p>
<p>&quot;One reason to delist was that Global shares have had a very low turnover since their listing,&quot; said Zsolt Furedi, corporate finance official at Creditanstalt Securities.</p>
<p>In February Global shares had an average daily turnover of 1.85 million forints, according to figures released in the monthly report of the BSE.</p>
<p>On Monday, following the publication of the buyout offer which runs from March 24 to May 12, 1997, and from January 5 to February 27, 1998, Global shares rose 200 forints to 2,000.</p>
<p>Beyond the delisting, Tesco's investment plans in Hungary remain intact and it will go ahead with plans to open new stores in addition to the 43 it has now.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got very ambitious investment plans,&quot; said Global's board member Robin Caley. The construction of five new stores would start this year. Tesco has so far invested some 60 million pounds in Global, Caley said.</p>
<p>In 1996 Global posted an unudited loss of 1.8 billion forints on sales of 11.3 billion, against an after-tax profit of 303 million on sales of 6.84 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>But Caley said Global's finances were in line with Tesco's budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The financial performance of Global, it's in line with our plans,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We achieved a very strong sales increase during 1996,&quot; he said, adding that turnover was expected to quadruple from current levels by around the end of 1998 or early 1999.</p>
