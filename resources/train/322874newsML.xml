<p>Nestle SA chief financial officer Mario Corti said the company would post better results from the United States this year and remedy problems in its beverage business there that weighed on 1996 group sales.</p>
<p>Asked by Reuters Financial Television if Nestle would improve U.S. results this year, he said: &quot;Yes, we will. It is hard to say just how much we will be able to pick up, but we will definitely have put the problems we encounted last year behind us.&quot;</p>
<p>He said U.S. beverage sales were the prime reason 1996 group sales by volume rose no more than 2.7 percent.  </p>
<p>A spokesman said Corti was referring to problems with trade loading in the U.S. that distorted sales, especially for instant coffee.</p>
<p>Corti gave an upbeat assessment for 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I think generally we take a very constructive outlook for 1997. We feel that Europe has a lot of momentum, especially eastern Europe where we did very well last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have solid positions in virtually all the emerging markets in the world and we believe the problems in North America will be corrected as well. All in all we are constructive for 1997,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>He said Nestle stood to gain if the dollar remains strong against the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>&quot;At the current rate this will have quite an impact on sales converted into Swiss francs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to bear in mind the dollar is trading at around 1.41 (francs) right now, whereas the weighted rate in the published sales figure for 1996 is 1.24. That is quite a difference, but we will have to say how things develop over the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Corti played down concern expressed by some analysts that the currency component of Nestle's overall 7.1 percent 1996 sales gain to a record 60.5 billion francs was only 1.4 percentage points.</p>
<p>The main movement against the dollar came in the second half of the year, he noted, adding the Swiss franc appreciated against the yen, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso.</p>
<p>&quot;Since our business in these countires is relatively important, the...weighted rate is obviously affected,&quot; he said.</p>
