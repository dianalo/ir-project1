<p>Italian bond futures drifted lower in late afternoon following the trend in Treasuries while worries over the 1998 budget and the government's three-year economy plan undermined investor confidence, dealers said.</p>
<p>U.S. April retail sales showed a 0.3 percent decline on the month and initially pushed T-bonds higher, but then they eased back which soon led to a weakening in BTPs and bunds.</p>
<p>Dealers said there is some caution over the prospects for the 1998 budget and what measures it will contain, which coupled with fading hopes of a interest rate cut by the Bank of Italy caused the market to look and consolidate at these levels.  </p>
<p>Dealers are expecting to see a deficit-cutting budget of around 25 trillion lire but are waiting to see what measures are contained in the package, while the market also awaits details of the government's three year economic plan (DPEF) containing targets for 1998-2000 which is expected around the end of May.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are seeing is a little bit a caution creeping in and we can expect some consolidation around these levels,&quot; said one LIFFE trader.</p>
<p>Economic data released earlier showing that Italian March PPI posted a year-on-year rise of 0.9 percent against a previous 0.8 percent increase had little market impact.  </p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi met trade union leaders on Tuesday for the first round of talks over controversial welfare reforms, but the heads of Italy's big three trades union federations told Prodi they would not start full negotiations until the government released its DPEF plan.</p>
