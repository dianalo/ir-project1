<title>FRANCE: France's Pasqua backs new referendum on Europe.</title>
<headline>France's Pasqua backs new referendum on Europe.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-03-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Conservative former interior minister Charles Pasqua appealed on Sunday for a new referendum on European unity as a way to promote traditional French values like patriotism and counter the far-right National Front.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not seem possible to me that we can move to a new phase of (European) construction without consulting the French people,&quot; said Pasqua, who opposed the Maastricht treaty on European union when French voters narrowly approved it in a 1992 referendum.</p>
<p>Pasqua, a member of French President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR, said in an interview on RTL radio that French politics was divided over whether to abandon or retain traditional French republican values.</p>
<p>He said mainstream parties like his RPR had given up on such values as patriotism and nationalism, leaving the field to Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front, which has enjoyed a recent surge in popularity a year ahead of 1998 general elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is not the National Front. It is the inability of our political parties -- those which are governing and those which have governed -- to solve the French people's problems,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want to block extremist movements, you must not provide them with exclusive access to the ideas that used to belong to the major parties,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pasqua has been organising a campaign to convince the RPR to return to what he sees as its traditional values.</p>
<p>His &quot;France of Tomorrow&quot; association sponsored a colloquium on the topic on Sunday. But he denied he was trying to split the party in two.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no Gaullist party today,&quot; he said. If there was one, the National Front would have only five to seven percent of the vote.&quot;</p>
<p>Le Pen won 15 percent of the vote in the 1995 presidential election.</p>
<p>Pasqua was a longtime backer of Chirac, but turned his back on his old friend during the 1995 campaign and endorsed the unsuccessful candidacy of rival Gaullist and then-prime minister Edouard Balladur.</p>
