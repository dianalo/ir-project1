<p>Singapore gas oil swaps firmed in active volatile trading late afternoon Thursday peaking at $26.65 per barrel on profit-taking but gave up half its gains on expectations of aggressive physical offers, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was volatile as the Wall Street players bought the market up but it quickly disapeared after these buyers withdrew,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the buying from the Wall Street players were mostly to capture earlier profits.  </p>
<p>Traders said the swaps market may fall again to below $26.00 per barrel as was the case on Wednesday when the physical players come out to offer later in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Physical offers are likely to be at an aggressive level similar to yesterday,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Offers for physical cargoes were seen down to $24.80 per barrel loading in mid-February on Wednesday.</p>
<p>February fuel oil swaps extended its strengthen on expectations of renewed physical buying interest.  </p>
<p>The market was last quoted at $101.50/$102.50 with March quoted at $102.50/$103.50 per tonne, up about $5.00 from Wednesday.</p>
<p>February swaps traded at $100.00, $102.75 and $103.00 per tonne earlier today.</p>
<p>The market rebounded after several physical buyers emerged late Wednesday when offers fell to a low of $93.00 per tonne free-on-board Singapore.</p>
<p>One 20,000-tonne cargo traded at this level between a European major and a Dutch trader but other buyers at this level failed to secure any cargoes.  </p>
<p>But others said the rebound might be short-lived as supplies remain healthy.</p>
