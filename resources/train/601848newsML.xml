<p>South Korean pork importers have been unable to return shipments of Taiwanese pork, banned following an outbreak of disease, because of a dispute with Taiwanese exporters, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;One of our suppliers, Cargill Taiwan Corp, has been rejecting our request to accept returns of previously imported pork following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease,&quot; said a trader with Jinju Ham Co.</p>
<p>The dispute is over which side will assume losses from the returns. Taiwanese suppliers have asked South Korean buyers to share the losses, but South Korean buyers so far have refused.</p>
<p>The Jinju trader said the company had been trying to return about 72 tonnes of pork to Cargill Taiwan.</p>
<p>The trader said it had returned 60 tonnes of previously imported pork on April 10 to another Taiwanese supplier, Tai Shin Food and Frozen Industrial Co Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot understand why Cargill Taiwan is rejecting our request to return the pork unlike the other exporter,&quot; the Jinju trader said.</p>
<p>Taiwan, a major world pork supplier, halted exports on March 20 because of an outbreak of the highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease. It resumed exports on April 17 on the condition that exporters obtained permits in advance from importing countries.</p>
<p>South Korea banned imports of Taiwanese pork on March 21, and that ban is still in effect.</p>
<p>The disputed shipments arrived after the outbreak.</p>
<p>Cargill Taiwan would accept the returned shipments if buyers shared equally the losses, said Lee Jin-hong, a lawyer with the Seoul firm hired by Cargill Taiwan to negotiate with South Korean buyers.</p>
<p>Lee said negotiations broke down at the end of April and Cargill Taiwan had given no further instruction.</p>
<p>Cheiljedang Corp also has been trying to return pork to Cargill Taiwan, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are negotiating with Cargill Taiwan but we cannot say when it will be concluded,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Kim Jeong-hoon, an animal health official at South Korea's Agriculture Ministry, said the amount of pork to be returned from South Korea totalled 952 tonnes, with 619 tonnes already returned.</p>
<p>The remaining 333 tonnes were stored in a refrigerated warehouse at the port of Pusan, Kim said.</p>
<p>The stored amount included 182 tonnes from Cheiljedang, 72 tonnes from Jinju, 19 tonnes from Kukje Corp and 60 tonnes from Lotte Ham and Milk Co Ltd, he said.</p>
<p>A senior official with Lotte Ham said his company had been unable so far to return its 60 tonnes to Tai Shin.</p>
<p>&quot;I have tried to reach Tai Shin but they have not responded,&quot; the Lotte Ham official said.</p>
<p>He said payment terms on some of the shipments already returned to Taiwan remained unsettled.</p>
<p>South Korea imported 1,497 tonnes of pork from Taiwan in 1996. It had imported 2,068 tonnes before this year's foot-and-mouth outbreak.</p>
