<headline>Dhaka stocks close down amid panic selling.</headline>

<p>Panicked investors mounted a selling pressure after the news that Bangladeshi banks were in crisis due to huge bad debt plunging the Dhaka stocks for a second day, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) benchmark index lost 31.87 points or 3.02 percent at 1,022.2 on a turnover of 49 million taka on Thursday. Losers led gainers by 86 to 24. Amam Sea Food Industries shed 162 taka to 2876, Bangladesh Tobacco Co fell 9.23 to 129.87 and Beximco Pharma was down 4.21 to 106.76.</p>
<p>Market analysts said on Thursday that investors felt the banking crisis would hurt the country's economy.</p>
<p>The DSE index dropped 5.21 percent on Wednesday as the market reacted to central bank governor Lutfar Rahman Sarkar's comments on Tuesday that the country's banking system was on the verge of collapse due to huge overdue loans.</p>
<p>Broker Shakil Rizvi said: &quot;The share prices dipped because the investors were wary about the prospect of the economy under present circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>Broker Moshtaque Ahmed said: &quot;The market is in crisis of cash liquidity. No bank is offering loans to investors despite government instruction.&quot;</p>
<p>Bank officials, however, said the commercial banks were reluctant to take risk in a falling market. The market remained depressed for quite some time due to price manipulation by big market players, many of whom were later implicated for their alleged role in the share market scam.</p>
<p>One bank official said: &quot;We cannot finance in a falling market. The price of the scrips has reached the bottomline and it is very risky to provide fund to such a weak market.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, the banks used to offer 50 percent loan on the average price of the scrips.</p>
