<headline>GM shuts down second assembly plant due to strike.</headline>

<p>Less than two days into a transmission plant strike, General Motors Corp.  Thursday moved to idle four assembly plants and braced for broader shutdowns of its vast North American car and truck operations.</p>
<p>GM halted production Thursday at large-car plants in Flint and Orion Township, Mich., and told workers at a small-car plant in Lansing, Mich., not to report to work Friday.</p>
<p>Workers at a mid-size car plant with two assembly lines in Oshawa, Ontario, also were told to stay home Friday, bringing to more than 17,000 the number of workers idled by the strike at GM's Warren, Mich., Powertrain Division plant, including strikers.</p>
<p>About 2,800 people walked off the job at the transmission, wheel and suspension parts plant in suburban Detroit late Tuesday night over demands for more jobs.</p>
<p>If the strike continues into next week, nearly every GM assembly plant in North America could run out of Warren-made parts and shut down.</p>
<p>GM has been down this road before. A 17-day strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants forced the automaker to shut down 26 of 29 North American assembly plants, idling more than 175,000 workers. The walkout cost GM and its stockholders about $900 million.</p>
<p>But analysts say investors will continue to be extremely patient with the automaker as it stands up to resistance from the UAW over its long-term plans to shrink its work force through attrition.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the settlement is not viewed as impeding their long-term competitiveness, the strikes are non-events,&quot; said Furman-Selz Inc. auto analyst Maryann Keller.</p>
<p>GM stock closed off 62.5 cents at $58.375 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The automaker, which consistently ranks below rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. in manufacturing efficiency, wants to shed about 30,000 workers over the next three years through normal attrition in an effort to become competitive.</p>
<p>Jim Marcum, financial secretary for UAW Local 909, said strikers are not happy about forcing other union members off the job but are standing firm against GM.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an unfortunate byproduct,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't want other people to be out of work because of us. That's never the union's intention.&quot;</p>
<p>Bargainers for GM and Local 909 continued talks aimed at ending the strike late into the day Thursday after talks continued past midnight Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The nearby Flint and Orion plants were the first to shut down because they receive transmissions on a &quot;just-in-time&quot; delivery basis that keeps their inventories low.</p>
<p>The Flint plant builds the Buick LaSabre and Pontiac Bonneville sedans, while the Orion plant also builds the Bonneville, as well as the Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile Aurora and Eighty Eight cars.</p>
<p>Lansing builds the Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Achieva and Chevrolet Cavalier cars, while the Oshawa assembly lines produce the Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo and the Buick Century and Regal models.</p>
