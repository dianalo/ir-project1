<p>A U.S.-based human rights group protested on Friday against a secret trial at Sudan's army headquarters of 31 people accused of crimes punishable by the death penalty.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the defendants were alleged to have been tortured to make confessions and called for exclusion of such statements from evidence at the trial which started last month.</p>
<p>It said the 31 defendants were accused of waging war on the state and mutiny although two were civilians. The trial is being held at the military intelligence school at army headquarters in Khartoum.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said the 31 including a retired major general were detained in February 1996 and were alleged to have had roles in a coup attempt. All were reported to have been tortured and coerced into signing confessions.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight military officers accused of a coup attempt in 1990 were executed after a secret and hasty military hearing conducted without proper judicial safeguards, the group said.</p>
