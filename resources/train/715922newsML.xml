<p>A group of U.S. Congressmen sent a letter to President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday urging him to veto a bill they believe will curtail religious freedom in Russia and possibly damage its ties with the United States.</p>
<p>In a press statement faxed to Reuters, one of the lawmakers, Gary Ackerman, said they were protesting against a bill entitled &quot;On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association&quot; already approved by Russia's two houses of parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;This law would create a chilling atmosphere and perhaps even reverse the tremendous steps towards democracy and freedom that Russia has taken over the past several years,&quot; Ackerman said.</p>
<p>&quot;This legislation conveys an attitude of intolerance towards religious organisations unmatched since the peak of the anti-religious policies of the Soviet Union.&quot;</p>
<p>The bill has also been condemned by human rights activists and many religious groups as discriminatory. It will become law if Yeltsin signs it.</p>
<p>&quot;If he signs the bill into law, it could certainly set a very bad precedent in U.S.-Russian relations,&quot; Ackerman said.</p>
<p>The bill, which has been welcomed by the Russian Orthodox Church, says only denominations that have operated in Russia for at least 15 years can set up new religious organisations. It also imposes new curbs on religious activity by foreign groups.</p>
<p>Ackerman said thousands of churches, schools and religious institutions amounting to more than two thirds of those registered today would lose their current legal status and would have to cease normal operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Faiths that would be stripped of their legal status include Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Adventists, the Salvation Army and newer denominations of Judaism,&quot; Ackerman said.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill, who include Russia's most senior Orthodox clergyman Patriarch Alexiy, say it will help halt the division of Russians along religious lines.</p>
<p>They also say it will protect people against destructive cults like Japan's doomsday sect Aum Shinri Kyo, which had many followers in Russia.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Church has been alarmed by the post-Soviet explosion of religious sects, which have fed on Russians' poverty, spiritual hunger or desire for the new and exotic.</p>
<p>Critics say the bill goes much further than that and contravenes Russia's constitution. They point out that 15 years ago religious groups were still tightly controlled by the officially atheist Communist state.</p>
