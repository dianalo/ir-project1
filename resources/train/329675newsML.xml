<title>FRANCE: Fear grips Algiers after wave of Ramadan bombings.</title>
<headline>Fear grips Algiers after wave of Ramadan bombings.</headline>

<p>Car bombings have claimed at least 50 lives in a week in and around Algiers and plunged the city into fear as Islamist guerrillas step up their insurgency.</p>
<p>When Salim Aouadi rushed into a pharmacy to buy medicine for his child on Wednesday, shopkeepers sprang to pull down their shutters and customers scrambled for safety, fearing Aouadi's hastily parked car was rigged with explosives.</p>
<p>&quot;You gave us such a fright,&quot; a shop owner screamed when Aouadi emerged from the pharmacy a few minutes later.</p>
<p>Residents said the scene summed up the mood of the city after eight car bombings in seven days.</p>
<p>Two car bombs killed at least three people and wounded scores in the garrison city of Blida 50 km (30 miles) south of Algiers on Wednesday, residents said by telephone.</p>
<p>The day before, two car bomb explosions killed at least 12 and wounded scores in Algiers. Newspapers said those bombs raised the toll since the start of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan on January 10 to at least 150 dead and 170 wounded.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility but analysts believe the bombs are a message to President Liamine Zeroual that the Islamic fundamentalists remain a formidable force despite repeated claims that the government has crushed them.</p>
<p>Algeria's radical Armed Islamic Group (GIA) had promised to intensify its &quot;holy war&quot; during Ramadan, threatening a 50-bomb campaign. Besides bombs that killed, at least 17 have been defused in the past three weeks.</p>
<p>Some Algiers residents said their crowded city of nearly four million was experiencing the worst wave of bombings since the Ramadan 1962, when hardline French colonialists unleashed a campaign of violence to oppose Algeria's independence. Algeria won independence in July 1962.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's violence since 1992 when authorities cancelled a general election that radical Islamists were poised to win.</p>
<p>&quot;Many residents believed the bombers aim to bomb every sector of Algiers after they started by the city center in late December, then Belouizdad street on Sunday and then Madania district on Tuesday,&quot; said a resident reached by telephone.</p>
<p>The authorities, conceding they cannot stop the car bomb onslaught, appealed for public help to halt the guerrillas.</p>
<p>&quot;The state is carrying out its duty to end terrorism. The population has an active role to play also and the people shall increase vigilance,&quot; Interior Minister Mustpaha Ben Mansour said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to ward off bomb attacks but with the population's collaboration and vigilance, terrorism will be defeated,&quot; he said.</p>
