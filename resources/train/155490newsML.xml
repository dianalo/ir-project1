<p>Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said on Tuesday the United Nations should have a presence in Croatia's Eastern Slavonia area until the end of 1997 with troops leaving in mid-July.</p>
<p>The Serb-held enclave, on the Yugoslav border, is the last remaining Croatian area not under Zagreb's control. It is expected to revert to Croatia 30 days after local elections are held, anticipated for March at the earliest but more likely in April, U.N. sources said.</p>
<p>In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali said the U.N. Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, or UNTAES, of more than 5,000 troops, could not do its job properly if disputes about its mandate continued. The mission is headed by American Jacques Klein.</p>
<p>&quot;A decision by the council to extend the mandate will discourage those who hold the false belief that political pressure will cause the mission to compromise on the performance of its tasks,&quot; he said. The current mandate expires on Jan. 15.</p>
<p>He recommended that troops stay until July 15, an extension of six months, and that the United Nations keep observers in the region until December 1997. Diplomats said a civilian and military mission was forseen.</p>
<p>Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who is running for re-election in mid-1997, had wanted the troops out as soon as possible or at the latest in the spring. Diplomats said Zagreb has agreed to the July extension but talks are still going to keep U.N. observers there until the end of 1997.</p>
<p>The Security Council is expected to vote on extending the mandate sometime in November. Key members of the expanded Contact Group. which determines policy on the ex-Yugoslavia, have already approved Boutros-Ghali's recommendations. They include the United States, Germany, Russia, Britain, France and Italy.</p>
<p>Eastern Slavonia is a particularly sensitive issue for Zabreb, the scene of major Serb-Croat battles at the beginning of Croatia's 1991 war of independence from federal Yugoslavia that resulted in carnage of the Danube town of Vukovar.</p>
<p>Minority Serbs went on to seize almost a third of Croatia with backing from the Yugoslav army. A year ago the Croatian army retook two of three Serb enclaves in a blitz offensive.</p>
<p>U.S. envoys then brokered a solution for Eastern Slavonia to avert another Croatian offensive that would have jeopardised the peace process in neighbouring Bosnia.</p>
<p>In his report, Boutros-Ghali faulted both Serb and Croatian hardliners and singled out the Croatian government for not meeting all its commitments and obligations towards the region.</p>
<p>&quot;An atmosphere of confrontation and obstruction has developed which appears to be related more to domestic political concerns that to the work of UNTAES,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This has increased the anxiety and fears of current residents of the region, playing into the hands of Serb hardliners whose obstructionism in turn fuels extremists on the Croatian side.&quot;</p>
<p>UNTAES is to prepare Eastern Slavonia for reconciliation with Croatia, including economic rehabilitation, law and order, the return of refugees, construction of housing and the organisation of local elections before its mandate expires.</p>
<p>An unknown factor, however, is how many Serbs will flee to the rump Yugoslavia -- comprising Serbia and Montenegro -- across the border after Croatia takes over.</p>
