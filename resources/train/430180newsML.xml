<p>The Colombian-based subsidiary of U.S. company  Drummond is looking to boost output from its coal mine in northern Cesar province by more than 18 percent this year, a senior company official said Monday.</p>
<p>Production totalled 4.4 million tonnes of coal last year and D.L. Lobb, Drummond's operations manager in Colombia, said output would increase to 5.2 million tonnes in 1997.</p>
<p>The company currently exports much of the coal from its La Loma mine to Europe via its shipping terminal in the Caribbean coast port of Santa Marta.</p>
<p>Lobb said, however, that Drummond hoped to supply more coal to Japan, which takes about 300,000 tonnes per year, and open new markets in Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;The company expanded rapidly through 1996 and we're very satisfied with that. I can't speak for other (U.S.) companies here but things have gone very well for us,&quot; Lobb told reporters.</p>
<p>He said Drummond would invest as much as $100 million in its mining operations in Colombia over the next five years.</p>
<p>The company took over the management of La Loma in 1995 on a 30-year lease and Lobb said Drummond may look to take on further concessions in neighboring La Guajira province. Together the two provinces account for about 84 percent of Colombia's coal production with estimated reserves of 6.6 billion tonnes.</p>
<p>There is a heavy leftist guerrilla presence in both regions but Lobb said the latent insecurity had not affected production or exports.</p>
