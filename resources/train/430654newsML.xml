<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss shares close at record high.</title>
<headline>Swiss shares close at record high.</headline>
<text>
<p>1530 GMT - Swiss shares closed at a record high, rising for the fifth day in a row, but the blue-chip Swiss Market Index slipped from the day's high of almost 4,700 points on late profit-taking.</p>
<p>Dealers said firming stocks on Wall Street, soaring futures on government bonds and technicals were behind the rise. Foreign investors showed lively interest in Novartis, insurer Winterthur and bank shares in high turnover, they said.</p>
<p>* The SMI closed up 45.8 points, or 0.99 percent, to 4,684.7 points, after touching an all-time high at 4,696.5.  </p>
<p>* The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) also reached a record high of 2,959.03 points, up 20.59 points or 0.7 percent from Friday's close.</p>
<p>The market was watching Wall Street. One trader said he was confident the rise could continue if players kept covering short positions. &quot;But the air is getting increasingly thin at these high levels and there's a danger of a bigger correction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>* UBS bearers added 10 francs to 1,348 francs after meeting strong resistance at 1,350.  </p>
<p>* SBC powered ahead six francs, or nearly two percent, to 307 francs ahead of the bank's annual press conference on Wednesday. Dealers said market expectations were high for SBC's results since it has been the first among major Swiss banks to announce sweeping changes in provisions policy.</p>
<p>* Novartis registered was up 21 francs at 1,800. Roche certificates soared 155 francs to 12,695.</p>
<p>* Insurer Winterthur climbed nine francs to 957.</p>
<p>* ABB, Alusuisse and Sulzer lost ground. Adecco slid 15.5 francs to 460 after a downgrade by NatWest.  </p>
<p>* On the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex), demand was high for SMI options.</p>
<p>Dealers said this was mostly due to hedging transactions. In total, 229,403 options were traded, of which 60,744 were SMI calls and 56,932 were SMI puts.</p>
<p>Volatilities were slightly higher, particularly in Zurich and CS Group, a dealer said.</p>
<p>7,355 contracts were traded in SMI futures. March SMI added 49.0 points to 4,699.</p>
