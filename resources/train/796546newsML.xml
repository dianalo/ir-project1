<p>One hiker was found dead on Wednesday and 10 others were feared to have perished in a flash flood that sent a wall of water 11 feet (3.3 metres) high crashing through a narrow canyon in northern Arizona, officials said.</p>
<p>As searchers continued the grim task of looking for the 10 hikers, most of whom are Europeans, officials said the likelihood of finding anyone alive was remote.</p>
<p>The hikers were trapped when the 11-foot wall of water roared through the normally dry Antelope Canyon, about 50 miles (80 kms) north-east of the Grand Canyon, on Tuesday, according to officials.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always a possibility that someone could have found high ground and is safe, but that's not likely,&quot; said Detective Mike Rice of the Coconino County Sheriff's Office. &quot;Right now we believe that there were no survivors.&quot;</p>
<p>The 11 hikers consisted of seven people from France, two from the United States and one each from Britain and Sweden. The name of the hiker found dead was not immediately released.</p>
<p>Rice said that so far there was only one known survivor, tour guide Poncho Quintana, who worked for Los Angeles-based TrekAmerica. Five of the hikers were on a tour organized by TrekAmerica.</p>
<p>Jack Aakhus, TrekAmerica personnel director, said he spoke briefly to Quintana just hours after he was rescued on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;He said, 'Jack, I don't know what happened,'&quot; Aakhus said. &quot;The water hit me and it just kept coming.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-second conversation ended when the cellular telephone went dead. Aakhus said Quintana was battered and bruised but not seriously injured from the ordeal. He was taken to hospital for observation and released.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point we don't have any real concrete information about what happened to the others,&quot; Aakhus added. &quot;That's what we're all waiting to hear right now.&quot;</p>
<p>John Peluso, an assistant manager for TrekAmerica, told Reuters the hikers had gone into the canyon to take photographs when the flood hit.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very popular place for photographs. It is run by the Navajo Indians who charge an entrance fee. It is known as a slot canyon, the walls are very high and only about five feet (1.5 m) apart. It really is quite spectacular but because it is so narrow it is not the place to be when a flash flood hits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Northern Arizona has been hit by a number of flash floods in recent days, with tourists and residents being forced to evacuate the Havasupai Indian Reservation earlier this week.</p>
