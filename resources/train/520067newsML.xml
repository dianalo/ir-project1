<p>The Canadian government has formally requested the broadcast regulatory agency CRTC to study the possibility of the establishment of new national television networks.</p>
<p>A statement from Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, received late on Thursday, noted that she had first announced the government's intention to do so on January 28.</p>
<p>On that day, the cabinet denied an appeal by CanWest Global Communications Corp of a decision by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) denying it a television license in Alberta, which would have helped it establish a presence across Canada.</p>
<p>The CRTC chose the small company Craig Broadcast Systems Inc and Copps said at the time it was a valid individual licensing decision, but that the question of adding national television networks needed to be examined.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal of the Broadcasting Act, and the goal of this government, is to increase the quantity and quality of Canadian programming in both official languages,&quot; Copps said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to ensure that over-the-air broadcasters, whether as parts of networks or as parts of station ownership groups, continue to provide a clear reflection of our country both on a regional and a national basis.&quot;</p>
<p>She added: &quot;In a world of expanding viewer choices, it is vital that quality Canadian programming remain available and attractive to Canadian audiences.&quot;</p>
<p>The CRTC will have to hold hearings, seek public comment and report back to the government on issues and options related to the possible establishment of new networks.</p>
