<title>DENMARK: Danisco damps Danish shares but support seen.</title>
<headline>Danisco damps Danish shares but support seen.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-06-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>For the second day running falls in Danisco weighed down the Danish KFX index but dealers believed the slide had reached bottom.</p>
<p>The food and beverage maker fell 14 crowns, to 400.00 after annual results on Wednesday in which it scored strong 1996/97 profit growth but said the rate of increase was likely to be less over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>It did not say by how much.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically it looks as if there is support at 400.00 so I don't see why the KFX can't end the week at this level,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index fell 0.77 point -- 0.45 percent -- to 171.23 in overall bourse turnover of 1.5 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The KFX August future fell 0.10 point to 172.50 with 10 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Other than Danisco top 20 share movements were relatively minor.</p>
<p>Ten shares fell and six rose, among them the top two banks. Den Danske moved a crown up to 640.00 and BG Bank rose three crowns to 351.00. Third-placed Unidanmark fell three crowns, to 372.00.</p>
