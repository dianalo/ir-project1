<text>
<p>President Mobutu Sese Seko, one of Africa's longest-serving strongmen, has clung to power in Zaire for over three decades with a blend military ruthlessness and political acumen.</p>
<p>A master of the power game, he exploited the West's strategic fears during the Cold War and gave his sprawling and chaotic country at the heart of Africa a badly needed focus in the turbulent aftermath of independence from Belgium in 1960.</p>
<p>A reluctant convert to democracy, he started pushing, in public at least, for much-delayed multi-party presidential elections -- confident that his support in rural areas would enable him to legitimise his rule through the ballot box.</p>
<p>&quot;The democratic process must inevitably be crowned by free and fair elections,&quot; he said in a 1996 New Year address.</p>
<p>&quot;I am perhaps the only dictator in the world who is calling for such elections,&quot; he once told a television interviewer.</p>
<p>But prostate cancer and a Tutsi-dominated revolt intervened, weakening his grip on the mineral-rich nation of 40 million people. As Laurent Kabila's rebels have advanced from the east, capturing towns and territory, Mobutu's popularity faded.</p>
<p>Ordinary Zaireans, weary of the ravages of his notoriously ill-disciplined army, poverty and widespread official corruption, have welcomed the rebels as liberators.</p>
<p>Kabila insisted he must quit. &quot;There can be no ceasefire or indeed elections in this country until Mobutu and all he represents is removed and thrown away,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The son of a cook and a hotel maid, Mobutu, who stands six feet (1.8 metres) tall, was born in Lisala in Equateur province on October 14, 1930.</p>
<p>Denounced as everything from a dictator to a thief, critics accuse him of ruining what is potentially Africa's richest nation with a wealth of minerals and rich farmland.</p>
<p>A journalist turned soldier, he seized power in 1965 after the old Belgian Congo descended into chaos after independence.</p>
<p>Adopting a leopard-skin cap and bird-handled ebony cane as his trademarks, he has held onto power by keeping rivals in disarray or buying off enemies.</p>
<p>He amassed a personal fortune and solidified his grip on the country with a system of economic and political patronage that made millionaires of his close associates.</p>
<p>Most Zaireans remained mired in poverty.</p>
<p>The word &quot;kleptocracy&quot; -- meaning a bureaucracy in which corruption is endemic -- was coined with Zaire in mind.</p>
<p>Despite human rights abuses and using his position to enrich himself, Mobutu became the darling of the United States and others in the West as a buffer against the communist bloc.</p>
<p>Washington relied on Zaire as a supply route for the U.S.-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebel movement fighting a 17-year guerrilla war against the Marxist government of neighbouring Angola.</p>
<p>Mobutu's usefulness to Washington faded as Soviet influence declined in Africa and Soviet communism finally collapsed.</p>
<p>His erstwhile friends began to look more closely at his human rights record.</p>
<p>Under pressure to make reforms, the Zairean leader opened a Pandora's box when he permitted multi-party politics in April 1990 after more than two decades of single-party rule.</p>
<p>At the same time, the mineral-based economy collapsed as production from vital copper mines in the south plummeted.</p>
<p>Mobutu angered his Western backers, particularly Belgium, when soldiers attacked a student hostel in 1990, killing dozens of students. Belgium cut aid in response.</p>
<p>Mass opposition to Mobutu grew through 1991.</p>
<p>Surrounded by his Israeli-trained presidential guard, he retreated to his opulent northern palace in Gbadolite, dubbed &quot;Versailles in the Jungle&quot;, hurling defiance at his opponents.</p>
<p>Soldiers angry at not receiving a pay rise ran amok in Kinshasa in late 1991. France and Belgium sent in troops to protect foreign nationals. Looters killed at least 250 people.</p>
<p>Mobutu's sacking in December 1992 of reformist Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, a onetime ally turned enemy, and the intimidation of the pro-democracy interim parliament by his presidential guard brought further rebukes from abroad.</p>
<p>France barred him from visiting his villa in the Riviera. Other countries denied him and his entourage visas.</p>
<p>Shrewd political manoeuvring enabled Mobutu to neutralise a groundswell of public sympathy for Tshisekedi. An impeachment threat by a transitional parliament came to nothing.</p>
<p>Mobutu, a pragmatist, began a process of rehabilitation with key donors -- France, Belgium and the United States.</p>
<p>The 1994 exodus from Rwanda of over a million Hutus fearing reprisals for the genocide of minority Tutsis there, worked in his favour. His cooperation helped ease a humanitarian nightmare, bringing about a partial thaw in ties with the West.</p>
<p>France softened its stance after he cooperated with a French military expedition to halt the Rwanda killings. In April 1996, it announced a resumption of aid after a five-year freeze.</p>
<p>In August 1996, Mobutu had prostate cancer surgery in Switzerland. In October, rebels took up arms in the east.</p>
<p>As the Tutsi-led revolt spread and the rebels seized towns and territory. They now control over three-quarters of Zaire.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who spent much of the war convalescing in Europe, time, last returned home on March 22 in what many Zaire watchers saw as a final attempt to negotiate a dignified withdrawal.</p>
