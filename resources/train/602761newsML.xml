<p>The hatches between the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis and Russia's space station Mir swung shut on Wednesday as the two space crews prepared to go their separate ways.</p>
<p>The tunnel connecting the two spacecraft was closed at 8:43 a.m. EDT (1243 GMT), five days after Atlantis arrived at Mir to collect Jerry Linenger, who spent 122 days aboard the station, and drop off his replacement Michael Foale.</p>
<p>The shuttle crew said their farewells to Foale and his Russian crewmates, Vasily Tsibliev and Alexander Lazutkin, and one by one floated back aboard Atlantis.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll see you,&quot; shuttle skipper Charles Precourt told the waving Mir crew before the first hatch swung shut.</p>
<p>&quot;We've wished them well,&quot; Precourt radioed mission control. &quot;Just kind of sorry to see them close the hatch.&quot;</p>
<p>The hatches closed about an hour later than planned to accommodate an astronaut's last-minute consultation with a mission control doctor and to allow some final cargo exchanges.</p>
<p>Atlantis was due to uncouple from Mir at 9:04 p.m. EDT (0104 GMT Thursday) and return to Earth on Saturday.</p>
<p>Before the hatches closed, Linenger gave mission control a televised tour of Mir and recalled the events of Feb. 23 when a serious fire broke out.</p>
<p>Fighting the fire was difficult because of the cramped conditions aboard the station and visibility was near zero, he explained.</p>
<p>&quot;You could sort of see your fingers if you looked hard,&quot; he said. &quot;It was very, very dense smoke. An interesting experience, something you don't want to repeat, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>The blaze also blocked the route to one of the Soyuz spacecraft which would have been needed to evacuate the station.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have been very difficult to get through the flame itself to get to one of the rescue vehicles,&quot; he said. At the time of the blaze there were six crew members aboard the station.</p>
<p>During the tour, Linenger pointed out the space station's emergency breathing masks. They &quot;saved our lives&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The fire was the first in a string of mechanical breakdowns that marred Linenger's stay aboard Mir. Problems with the life support systems and leaks in the cooling systems followed.</p>
<p>NASA approved Foale's stay on Mir after most of the malfunctions were corrected. The British-born astronaut said he had no qualms living aboard the troubled, 11-year-old space station.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as my worries, I don't really have any right now,&quot; Foale told a news conference on Wednesday. &quot;As long as we keep working hard with the ground and keep the supplies coming, we can maintain these things.&quot;</p>
<p>As for Linenger, he only had one concrete plan after returning to Earth: &quot;I'm going fishing,&quot; he said.</p>
