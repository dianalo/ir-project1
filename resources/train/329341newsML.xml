<p>Tokyo naphtha prices were firmer on Thursday, buoyed by gains in crude prices on the ACCESS after-hours system, traders said.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha second-half March was assessed at $231.00/233.00 and first-half April at $230.50/232.00, compared to $228.50/230.50 and $227.00/229.00 respectively on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Spreads narrowed with the one-month spread from second-half March assessed at $1.50/3.00, against $3.00/4.00 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, second-half March switched hands at $231.00, first-half April at $230.00 and second-half March/second-half April at $3.00, traders said.  </p>
<p>Prompt naphtha supplies remain more than sufficient, traders said, adding that output cuts at Singapore refineries had yet to have an impact on the market.</p>
<p>In the low sulphur waxy residue market, February cargo prices are expected to be weighed down by slumping fuel oil prices, traders said.</p>
<p>They said buyers had kept to the sidelines, waiting for prices to come down and for the results of Korea Electric Power Corp's March delivery LSWR buying tender.</p>
<p>Gas oil traders said they were still wary about market direction, after recent sharp losses.</p>
