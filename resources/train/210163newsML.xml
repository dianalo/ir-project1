<p>Italian debt markets ended firm as the market held its breath in the expectation the lira would return to Europe's exchange rate mechanism at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like it'll be re-entry this weekend,&quot; one broker at a London investment bank said.</p>
<p>The EU's monetary committee will meet on Saturday to discuss the lira's re-entry and Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio said the Italian government had requested to return after four years floating free.</p>
<p>The lira itself was trading chirpily up at 998.45/8.95 per mark, the area it has held for the last coupld of days.  </p>
<p>The December Btp futures contract on LIFFE was 65 basis points higher at 127.92 and the July 2006 Btp was 23 basis points firmer at 108.77.</p>
<p>Economists and traders speculated whether the Bank of Italy might move to trim interest rates as early as this evening with inflation data and ERM re-entry as the possible spurs.</p>
<p>Others said however the central bank might wait until after an ERM return in order not to hit the currency with too many extraordinary influences at one go.</p>
<p>Preliminary inflation data from 10 sample cities showed Italy's year on year November CPI at 2.6 percent.  </p>
<p>October's final CPI was 3.0 percent. The final November data is due on December 5.</p>
<p>Analysts said BTP futures had limited scope for gain with lira re-entry as any rally might be met by profit-taking as investors kept an eye on their books ahead of the year end.</p>
