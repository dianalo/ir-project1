<p>President Jacques Chirac appealed to French voters on Tuesday not to put the nation's economic recovery at risk by voting for a return to socialism in next Sunday's crucial parliamentary election runoff.</p>
<p>But he did not say who he would choose to succeed fellow Gaullist Prime Minister Alain Juppe if the ruling centre-right coalition managed to overtake the left-wing opposition, which outpolled government candidates in last Sunday's first round.</p>
<p>In a dramatic seven-minute television broadcast, Chirac said he had understood the voters' first-round message but cautioned: &quot;Let us take care not to compromise everything at the moment when we are reaping the first fruits of our efforts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you really want to put the socialist ideas of yesteryear back in the saddle?,&quot; he asked. &quot;Given what is at risk, my dear compatriots, can you take the risk of abstaining?&quot;</p>
<p>Socialist party leader Lionel Jospin called Chirac's speech &quot;a formidable admission of failure&quot; and said the president had largely stuck to platitudes, borrowing some of the opposition's ideas to offer the illusion of change under the same coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;A new right-wing majority would not do that. Change can only come from a change of majority,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jospin said the left would campaign calmly, sticking to policy issues, and not let itself be distracted by the mood of panic created by Juppe's announcement on Monday that he would resign whoever won the cliffhanger second round.</p>
<p>Chirac, whose raised the tax burden to a record level after taking office in 1995, said tax cuts were vital to overcome France's record 12.8 percent unemployment.</p>
<p>He called for a more modern, decentralised state reconciling economic freedom with social solidarity.</p>
<p>But he left voters no wiser as to whether he favoured socially-minded Gaullist Philippe Seguin or free-marketeering ex-prime minister Edouard Balladur to succeed Juppe.</p>
<p>Chirac implied a left-wing victory could endanger European integration, but he made no mention of the planned single European currency. Many voters associated the Juppe government's unpopular austerity measures with deficit cuts required to meet the conditions for European monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the majority which you will choose does not take the risk of weakening European integration,&quot; Chirac said, adding that Europe must take on a stronger social dimension.</p>
<p>He paid tribute to Juppe, who said on Monday he would resign whatever the outcome of next Sunday's decisive runoff ballot after the combined left outpolled the centre-right by more than four points in Sunday's first round.</p>
<p>Extreme-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, whose supporters may hold the key to the outcome of the runoff, said Chirac appeared to be already resigned to sharing power with a left-wing government from next Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The president wanted to be as neutral and as flat as possible, and he succeeded. He wanted to sit on the fence. In his mind he is already in the cohabitation which he sees as inevitable,&quot; Le Pen said.</p>
<p>Greens party leader Dominique Voynet called Chirac's intervention &quot;a non-event&quot; and accused him of treating voters as simpletons.</p>
<p>&quot;He wanted to whip up the French people, but we will whip him by showing we want to change majority,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>French investors recovered their nerve on Tuesday after Monday's 3.9 percent plunge in share prices -- the biggest one-day dive in four years. Traders said even a left-wing win would bring no radical change in economic policy.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC 40 index closed up nearly one percent.</p>
