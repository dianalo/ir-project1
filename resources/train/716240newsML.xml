<p>The 20th anniversary of two additions to the Geneva Conventions was celebrated at a conference in Australia on humanitarian law hosted by the conventions' guardian, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
<p>The two protocols were added to the Geneva Conventions in June 1977 to strengthen the body of law protecting victims of war, especially civilians.</p>
<p>&quot;The protocols represented a milestone in giving world humanitarian law a modern picture with rules directly applicable to the protection of victims of conflicts,&quot; said Paul Bernard, ICRC's Phillipines-based delegate, who represents the Pacific region. Bernard said he believed the world was moving more and more towards the ratification of these two protocols which he said would eventually become as strong as the Geneva Conventions.</p>
<p>Signatory nations to the Geneva Conventions number 188.</p>
<p>Only 146 countries have signed Protocol I, which covers international armed conflicts, and just 138 have signed Protocol II, which deals with internal conflicts such as civil wars. Bernard said most countries that had not signed Protocol I had reservations about rules in the protocol concerning the use of certain weapons while Protocol II had fewer signatories because countries believed it restr icted their control of internal conflicts. &quot;We are really at a time where ratification is necessary because the world in terms of human rights has moved a long way very quickly,&quot; Bernard said.</p>
<p>Bernard said one of the ICRC's main priorities was get more countries to ratify Protocol II.</p>
<p>&quot;Most conflicts are internal conflicts. It is useless to speak at length about Protocol I because it is not applicable in so many cases -- there must be regulation of civil wars because they are the most devasting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A second priority was the introduction of an implementation system which gave countries the responsibility to apply the protocols. &quot;The ICRC is very much in favour of a permanent criminal court,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The possibility of introducing an international criminal court received a strong impetus late last year when six Red Cross staff were murdered at a hospital in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Bernard said the proposal would be discussed by the United Nations in New York next year.</p>
<p>The ICRC has given its own definition of war crimes but the proposal has been taken over by New Zealand and Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get a permanent criminal court that's good but we will only really have made some progress if a lot of countries ratify the agreement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bernard said he thought getting an agreement on the new court would take about three years but the ratification process could take up to twenty years.</p>
