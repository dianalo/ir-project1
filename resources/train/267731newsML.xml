<p>Mother Teresa, recovering from heart surgery, will be released from hospital on Thursday and return to her religious order, an official at an Indian heart clinic said.</p>
<p>&quot;She is leaving today. We are discharging her. She is all right,&quot; S.K. Tiwari, administrator of Calcutta's B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre, told Reuters. Last month the 86-year-old nun had her third heart operation in five years.  </p>
<p>The revered Roman Catholic missionary was fitted with a heart pacemaker in 1989. She had surgery last month to unblock two coronary arteries.</p>
<p>But a faltering heartbeat and long-standing lung and kidney problems delayed her recovery. Twice in the past week doctors have given her a mild electric shock to correct her heartbeat.</p>
<p>On Wednesday doctors said nagging bronchitis, which has periodically dogged Mother Teresa from her youth, had finally cleared up.</p>
<p>The 1979 Nobel peace prize winner had been pressing doctors to let her return to her Missionaries of Charity religious order, playfully asking nuns to order an ambulance to take her home.</p>
