<headline>NYC gets another $94 mln of retail bond orders.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>New York City on Monday said it had gotten another $94 million of retail orders during the second day of its pre-sale period, which brings the total to about $234 million.</p>
<p>&quot;New York City just seems to have a lot of staying power. It's the name recognition, level, (and) yields. We just continue to have this demand that other retail order periods can't get,&quot; said a city official, who declined to be named.  </p>
<p>The city typically expects to get $150 million to $200 million of orders, so the latest trend appears unsually strong.</p>
<p>The city official said that on Monday, the underwriters determined that around $140 million of orders were placed, about $6 million more than the estimate released late Friday.</p>
<p>As a result of the strong retail interest, New York City anticipated that it would have closed out five maturities -- 1999 to 2003 -- on Tuesday morning, three more than expected after Friday's initial results. The retail presale period ends on Tuesday.</p>
<p>New York City on Wednesday is selling $900 million of tax-exempt bonds and about $122 million of taxable debt, which includes $50 million of floating rate issues targeted for European buyers.</p>
