<p>Indian and Pakistani foreign ministry officials began a new round of talks on Friday, resuming a dialogue which the archrivals launched in March.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going in with a positive spirit and a positive approach,&quot; Indian foreign secretary Salman Haider told reporters as he arrived at Punjab House where he was greeted warmly by his Pakistani counterpart Shamshad Ahmad.  </p>
<p>Ahmad put his arm around Haider as the delegations walked inside to start the talks, which are scheduled to continue until Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our immediate task is to ... focus on the modalities, methodology and structure of dialogue,&quot; Haider told reporters at Islamabad airport on Thursday night. &quot;The agenda is to continue our discussions of which we already had one round in Delhi.&quot;</p>
<p>Ahmad made clear that Pakistan wanted to place the Kashmir dispute, which has caused two of the three wars fought with India since independence in 1947, high on the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our earnest desire, and it will be our endeavour, to focus on this issue as part of our overall attempt to find a peaceful solution of all problems that face us, he said.</p>
