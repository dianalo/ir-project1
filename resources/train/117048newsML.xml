<headline>Moroccan fisherman jailed for death of immigrants.</headline>
<dateline>TANGIER, Morocco 1996-10-15</dateline>

<p>A Moroccan fisherman whose boat sank carrying 26 would-be illegal immigrants to Spain was sentenced on Tuesday to four years in jail by a court in the northern city of Tangier, a court spokesman said.</p>
<p>Abdelaziz Fellah Boughaba, 27, was charged by the court of being responsible for the immigrants' deaths. He was also fined 500 dirhams ($57).</p>
<p>Boughaba earlier pleaded guilty and told the court it was the first time he had done &quot;something like this&quot;.</p>
<p>Boughaba was arrested last week after he told police his boat sank in the Strait of Gibraltar while trying to reach the southern Spanish coast.</p>
<p>His vessel, the six metre (20-ft) Moujahid, had a legal carrying capacity of six. The 26 Moroccans, from Nador province on the Mediterranean coast, had paid Boughaba 4,000 dirhams each to take them to Spain, the court heard.</p>
<p>Boughaba told the court he left the northern town of Larache with the group on October 5, at around midnight towards the Spanish southern coast.</p>
<p>&quot;When they saw the lights of coastal guard boats, the immigrants panicked...As they tried to hide, the vessel was destabilised, lost balance and immediately sank,&quot; Boughaba told the court.</p>
<p>The fisherman said he was the only one with a life jacket and had managed to swim ashore.</p>
<p>According to police, two bodies have so far been recovered near the Moroccan coast and eight others near the southern Spanish city of Algesiras.</p>
<p>His lawyer asked the court to free him, saying the Moroccan government was to blame for a policy of &quot;marginalising&quot; the country's young people so they sought to emigrate.</p>
