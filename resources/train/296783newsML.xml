<p>Poisonous gas which leaked from a tanker trunk in the Pakistani city of Lahore killed 30 people and more than 900 others were taken to hospital suffering from the effects of fumes, doctors said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The accident happened on Wednesday night when the gas, which doctors said was ammonia, leaked from cylinders being carried on the truck through Lahore's populous Mughalpura district.</p>
<p>Most of those taken to hospital were given first aid and allowed home, but more than 150 were kept in for treatment, some in critical condition, the doctors said.</p>
<p>Doctors had earlier put the death toll at 26 but later said four more victims had died in hospital, raising the toll to 30.</p>
<p>There was confusion about the type of gas, which also killed many animals, including buffalo, which was being carried to a factory making jeans.</p>
<p>Doctors said it was ammonia, while a local administration chief, deputy commissioner Kamran Lashari, said he thought it was chlorine.</p>
<p>The official APP news agency quoted sources in the chemical department of the Punjab University as saying the gas might have been choloroquine, which can cause hypoxia -- deficiency of oxygen delivered to body tissues -- and spasms.</p>
<p>&quot;People started rushing out of their houses choking,&quot; one witness said, describing scenes of panic. &quot;Some fell unconscious and nobody was in a position to help the other.&quot;</p>
<p>Reporters who toured the area said the gas had largely dispersed, although an acrid smell remained.</p>
<p>Police and troops patrolled the streets in gas masks and the bodies of many animals and chickens lay where they had choked to death, they said.</p>
<p>Cries of mourning could be heard from many houses in the area, while many people searched for their children and other relatives who had been removed from their homes by rescuers.</p>
<p>&quot;There is mourning in the whole area,&quot; Mohammad Anwar, a local resident, said.</p>
<p>After the incident, the army took control and launched a relief operation. The fire brigade and civil rescue workers also rushed to the scene to help hundreds of affected residents, APP said.</p>
<p>The provincial government announced compensation of 50,000 rupees ($1,243) for each dead person.</p>
