<p>On paper German-owned maxi Morning Glory is a clear favourite to win the 52nd Sydney to Hobart yacht race starting December 26.</p>
<p>But paper means very little in ocean racing.</p>
<p>On Saturday, in her first outing since arriving in Australia, the 24.5 metre (80 foot) Morning Glory snapped her mast and is now facing a race against time to either repair it or replace it. This is the third time Morning Glory has broken her mast this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be disappointing for the owner, the club and the other yachts in the race if Morning Glory was unable to take its place in the fleet,&quot; said race director Phil Thompson.</p>
<p>In contrast, Australian maxi Brindabella, rated by bookmakers as second favourite, has had smooth sailing in the lead-up to her fourth crack at the race.</p>
<p>Unlike last year, when Brindabella replaced a broken mast only 12 days before the race, the 23.7 metre (78 foot) maxi has been finely tuned and is setting a cracking pace on the water.</p>
<p>In a steady 15 knot breeze on Sydney Harbour on Friday, Brindabella sliced through the water at around 12-15 knots leaving the rest of the fleet in in her wake.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year we had quite a bit of trouble with the new mast,&quot; said owner George Snow. &quot;This year we are in good shape. We have worked hard to get our boat speed up.&quot;</p>
<p>But Brindabella has always been the bridesmaid in the Sydney to Hobart. In 1993 she was forced to retire with damage, while in a commanding lead and in 1994 and 1995 she ended up second behind two overseas maxis, Tasmania and Sayonara, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think in terms of bridesmaids,&quot; said Snow. &quot;Morning Glory is the fastest boat in this fleet on paper. But in terms of a Hobart everything depends on the weather. It's a hard slog south and I think we will all have to take our chances.&quot;</p>
<p>In third place on the betting is another Australian maxi, Amazon, which is showing good speed after having a new keel fitted last week. &quot;We have not sailed the boat much, but it feels a bit stiffer, less drag and faster all round,&quot; said owner Peter Walker.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect we will make some further adjustments before the race. But the boat has reached its peak in development, so to get it going faster will probably be up to the crew. I am fairly confident of a reasonable result in the Hobart.&quot;</p>
<p>But the race to Hobart is one of the toughest blue water events in the world and the 94-boat fleet can expect to encounter a fickle variety of weather conditions from running northeasters to gale force southerly headwinds to dead calm.</p>
<p>As a result the hi-tech, downwind flyers, such as Hong Kong's pocket maxi Exile, could snatch victory in the right conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not beat Brindabella or Morning Glory over the line unless something dramatic happens,&quot; said owner Warwick Miller. &quot;But it's a race that does not go by the cards.&quot;</p>
<p>But for the big boats the &quot;holy grail&quot; of the Sydney to Hobart is its 21-year race record.</p>
<p>In 1975 U.S. maxi ketch Kialoa set a race record of two days 14 hours 36 minutes and 56 seconds after flying down the east coast of Australia powered by strong northeasters.</p>
<p>But those ideal conditions have eluded the fleet since and only six line honours winners have even completed the race in under three days. Most have been robbed of the record after being becalmed in the final stages of the race.</p>
<p>Morning Glory and Brindabella can both achieve far greater boat speed than Kialoa, but it will once again be the fickle summer breezes off Australia's southern island Tasmania, not the hi-tech boats, which determine whether one of yachting's most prized records stands or falls.</p>
