<title>BOSNIA: War crimes sentence angers Bosnian Serbs.</title>
<headline>War crimes sentence angers Bosnian Serbs.</headline>
<dateline>SARAJEVO 1997-07-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>The first Serb found guilty of war crimes in Bosnia, including murder, torture and ethnic cleansing, was jailed for 20 years by a U.N. tribunal in the Netherlands on Monday.</p>
<p>The sentence on detention camp guard Dusan Tadic angered Bosnian Serb leaders who fear tougher action by the international community to hold more of them accountable for their deeds during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic and Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of the collective Bosnian presidency, both criticised the verdict as unjust.</p>
<p>In the hours between Tadic's court appearance and the funeral on Sunday of another war crimes suspect killed by NATO troops, an explosion rocked a Bosnian Serb hotel used by U.N. officials and international police monitors.</p>
<p>The blast in the hardline stronghold of Zvornik caused no injuries but prompted fears of a nationalist backlash against foreign personnel.</p>
<p>Tadic, who had faced a maximum of life imprisonment, looked shaken when handed 11 jail terms, the longest of them 20 years. They will run concurrently, with a recommendation that he serve at least 10.</p>
<p>U.S. presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald accused Tadic of sadistic brutality against Moslem neighbours driven from their homes during Serb ethnic cleansing in north Bosnia in 1992.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Moslem men were beaten and tortured, some to death, in camps set up by forces under the sway of nationalist leaders like former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who has also been indicted by the court.</p>
<p>&quot;You committed these crimes with intention and with sadistic brutality using knives, iron bars, the butt of a pistol, sticks and...in one case tightening a noose around the victim's neck until he lost consciousness,&quot; McDonald told Tadic.</p>
<p>The sentence was described as severe by defence lawyer Nikola Kostich, who argued Tadic was small fry. &quot;What the court does is place (him) at the top of the ladder...The fact is he was a very small player,&quot; Kostich said.</p>
<p>Krajisnik, who usually speaks for Karadzic, denounced the jailing of Tadic as a political act.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a political sentence,&quot; he told reporters in the north Bosnian town of Banja Luka where he met Plavsic. &quot;We are very bitter that care was not taken to put this trial on a better political foundation.&quot;</p>
<p>Hardline leaders are concerned that Western countries led by the United States will become more aggressive in enforcing the U.N. court's indictments and may try to arrest Karadzic and his wartime army commander General Ratko Mladic.</p>
<p>They were caught unawares last week when British troops swooped on war crimes suspect Simo Drljaca.</p>
<p>Drljaca, a former police chief who led Serb paramilitary gangs in ethnic cleansing operations, was killed when he fired on the soldiers while resisting arrest. He was buried on Sunday.</p>
<p>Another Bosnian Serb suspect, Milan Kovacevic, was arrested on the same day that Drljaca was shot and taken to the court's detention unit in The Hague, accused of complicity in genocide.</p>
<p>Russia, a Bosnian Serb ally which called the NATO action a &quot;cowboy raid&quot;, told British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook during a visit to Moscow on Monday that it was counter-productive.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't want operations of this kind to be repeated because this will not improve the situation on the ground,&quot; Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said.</p>
<p>Cook refused to guarantee there would be no more raids on suspects.</p>
