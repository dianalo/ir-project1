<title>RUSSIA: Western oil firms eye strategic deals with Russia.</title>

<p>Russian oil producers are seeking strategic alliances with the world's leading energy companies, a Western banking executive said on Wednesday, in possible partnerships which could boost Russian oil output significantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Every major oil company has talked to every major vertically-integrated company in Russia about being a strategic investor,&quot; said John Works, J.P. Morgan's vice president for natural resources in the former Soviet Union, during a break in an energy projects conference.</p>
<p>He said Western companies were interested both in equity ownership and in oil development projects.</p>
<p>The example Russian oil companies are seeking to replicate is that of LUKoil.</p>
<p>Atlantic Richfield Co (ARCO) of the United States acquired around eight percent of LUKoil's total equity in 1995 and 1996 and has a $5.2 billion, 18-year joint venture agreement with the company, which is Russia's largest oil producer.</p>
<p>&quot;There appears to be a desire to repeat what LUKoil did with its strategic investor,&quot; Works said. &quot;There may be a number of offers this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian oil output is nearly half its 1987 peak of 11.39 million barrels per day, or bpd, but at 6.03 million bpd in 1996, it seems to have turned the tide against the double-digit percentage drops seen earlier.</p>
<p>But untapped reserves are in remote, costly areas and will require major investment dollars, including foreign capital.</p>
<p>&quot;Hard-to-recover reserves are the core of our oil industry,&quot; Valery Kurashov, head of scientific and technical progress issues at the Fuel and Energy Ministry, told the same conference. &quot;If they are not tapped, it remains to expect a big fall in output.&quot;</p>
