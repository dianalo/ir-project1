<p>A state in Brazil's Amazon region will restrict the access of foreign scientists and researchers to the rainforest in a bid to curb the illegal trade in species and genetics, a lawmaker said on Friday.</p>
<p>A law approved this week by the legislative assembly of Acre will require non-Brazilian research groups to take out special licenses to work in the state. They will also have to work in association with Brazilian scientists.</p>
<p>Another provision in the bill seeks to guarantee payment of royalties to native Indian communities in return for their knowledge of the rainforest's plantlife.</p>
<p>&quot;This law will stop the modern form of colonalism which has been growing in the Amazon region for some years,&quot; Edvaldo Magalhaes, a Brazilian Communist Party lawmaker who wrote the bill, said.</p>
<p>Government officials have long suspected that foreign researchers often do not register genetic discoveries made in the Amazon and other parts of the country to avoid paying royalties and other taxes.</p>
<p>Magalhaes mentioned the case of a non-governmental organization that was recently found to have been trading painkillers with six Indian tribes in Acre for species of plants with medicinal properties. The plants were then sold to international pharmaceutical companies, Magalhaes said.</p>
