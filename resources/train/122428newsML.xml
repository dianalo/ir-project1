<headline>Reebok sees shoe, margin pressures in '97.</headline>

<p>Reebok International Ltd said on Thursday it expects continued pressure in its footwear sales and gross margins in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;As I've stated before, we do expect continued pressures on the sales performance of our footwear category into early 1997,&quot; chief executive Paul Fireman said in a statement with the company's third quarter results.</p>
<p>He indicated improvement would come when the company is able to offer a substantial number of products with its visible Hexalite, advanced DMX and 3DMF technologies at &quot;various price points.&quot;  </p>
<p>Worldwide sales for the Reebok brand in the 1996 third quarter were $834.8 million, a drop of 2.9 percent from 1995's third quarter. In the U.S., Reebok footwear sales were $300.8 million compared to sales of $363.1 million in the 1995 quarter, a 17.2 percent fall.</p>
<p>The company reported net income for the third quarter of $50.6 million, or $0.75 per share, compared to net income of $76.2 million, or $0.96 per share, a year ago.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts had expected the company to report $0.80 a share, according to First Call consensus.</p>
<p>Reebok said its gross margin in the third quarter was 39.2 percent, up from 38.9 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>But Fireman said, &quot;Looking ahead to 1997, we expect to see some pressure on gross margins as we bring our new technology products to market.&quot;</p>
<p>The gross margin will be pressured by start-up tooling costs, initially small production runs and increased freight charges, the company said.</p>
<p>Reebok said its total backlog of open customer orders to be delivered between October 1996 and March 1997 for the Reebok brand was up 6.9 percent at September 30.</p>
