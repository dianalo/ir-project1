<title>UK: Oil prices firm as driving season to kick in.</title>
<headline>Oil prices firm as driving season to kick in.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>World oil prices firmed on Thursday but trading was quiet ahead of a three-day holiday in the U.S. marking the traditional start to the summer driving season.</p>
<p>July Brent futures on London's International Petroleum Exchange closed five cents a barrel higher at $20.18, having slipped on profit taking from a new high for the day at $20.35 shortly before the 1915 GMT close. &quot;The market looks firm but undynamic,&quot; one trader said in the late afternoon, adding that London's volume at about 15,000 lots at the time was quite low. The volume at the close was about 17,400 lots. &quot;People are waiting to take new positions before the long holiday (in the U.S. and U.K.). Everyone who is short will try to cover their position tomorrow before the holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We should see higher price action pre-weekend,&quot; Prudential-Bache brokers said in their daily energy report.</p>
<p>Dealers also said they were watching NYMEX gasoline, with some in New York hoping that some sort of summer driving season rally in that contract could materialise by the end of May.</p>
<p>News that Turkish troops have moved deeper into Iraq was having little impact on Brent trading, although this sparked last minute short covering on NYMEX at the close on Wednesday, New York traders said.</p>
<p>Iraqi Kurdish officials said Turkish troops pushed 200 km (125 miles) into northern Iraq, much further than in past incursions. The Turkish operation is now in its ninth day, and there were also reports that Iraq, Syria and Iran have built up their forces in the region.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected that the United Nations would renew the Iraqi &quot;oil for food&quot; deal when it comes up for review by the Security Council on June 7, although the U.S. has not so far confirmed that it will give its approval.</p>
<p>&quot;It is pretty well accepted that the U.S. will agree,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London. A senior U.N. official, who said on Thursday that a rollover of the Iraqi deal was a foregone conclusion, however cautioned later that Washington had not made up its mind yet. &quot;The United States and several others have said they had not made up their minds,&quot; Undersecretary-General Yasushi Akashi told reporters after briefing the Security Council. The current accord allows Iraq to sell up to $2 billion of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other goods for its people suffering under U.N. sanctions imposed when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. A U.N. official who has said that a rollover seemed likely, added on Wednesday that U.S. suggestions for changes were not supported by other Council members and were believed to have been dropped by Washington.</p>
<p>But the U.N. will not include a recommendation to raise oil sales above the current $2 billion ceiling, the official added. &quot;Iraq wants an expansion in sales, but an expansion would be extremely difficult,&quot; he said. May 22 May 21</p>
