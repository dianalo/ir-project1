<headline>Thai stocks rally at close on foreign buying.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-01-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spurred by Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's pledge to solve national economic problems, foreign investors returned to market on Wednesday, pushing the stock index up 2.63 percent at the close.</p>
<p>The SET index, which declined in the three past consecutive trading days, rose 21.24 points to 828.91 on 4.7 billion baht turnover. The SET-50 index gained 1.91 points to 61.89.</p>
<p>&quot;The message given by the prime minister on his government's seriousness to solve the country's economic problems was clear and good. It's built confidence among foreign investors today,&quot; said Sanpong Limthamrongkul of Jardine Fleming Thanakom.  </p>
<p>Brokers said foreigners, who were net sellers of shares worth about 410 million baht on Tuesday, were most active.</p>
<p>&quot;It's expected that investors also bought today for short-term speculative reasons after the index fell in the past few days. The only news which pushed the index up was the prime minister's speech,&quot; said Sanpong.</p>
<p>In his speech at the Foreign Correspondents Club late on Tuesday, Chavalit urged Thais to tighten their belts and vowed that his six-week old government would speed up the slowing economy and narrow the current account deficit.  </p>
<p>All major sectors gained today. The finance sector advanced most, rising 7.66 percent followed by the electronic components sector, which gained 4.04 percent. The banking sector was up 3.87 percent.</p>
<p>Krung Thai Bank, Thailand's second largest commercial bank, topped the active list, rising 4.50 baht to 55. National Finance and Securities advanced 4.25 to 48.75 while Advanced Info Services slipped six to 244 and large capitalised Finance One rose 4.25 to 49.</p>
<p>Support is seen by some brokers at 812 and resistance at 830 on Thursday. -- Suthep Chawla (662) 652-0642</p>
