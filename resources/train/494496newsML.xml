<p>Chrysler Corp., moving to protect its dominance of the U.S. minivan market, said Tuesday it is offering a new $595 cash incentive on minivans equipped with a left-side sliding door.</p>
<p>The consumer incentive programme runs from Tuesday, April 8, through July 7. It replaces an &quot;owner loyalty&quot; incentive programme that offered rebates fo $500 to $750 only to owners of Chrysler's 1984-96 model minivans, which expired on Monday.</p>
<p>The new programme, available to anyone, offers $595 cash allowances to buyers of 1996 and 1997 Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager, and Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan models equipped with driver-side sliding doors.</p>
<p>The rebate, the first national incentive on Chrysler's minivans since they were redesigned for the 1996 model year, completely offsets the price of the left-side door on vehicles that offer it as an option. The incentive also is available on vehicles that offer the door as standard equipment.</p>
<p>About 90 percent of Chrysler minivans sold today are ordered with the fourth door, which was first introduced on redesigned 1996 models.</p>
<p>Chrysler's combined U.S. minivan sales totalled an all-time high of 538,807 vehicles in 1996, and sales this year are near the record pace of a year ago.</p>
<p>In March, minivan sales were 46,955, compared with 46,881 a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;We're determined to maintain our position as the automotive industry's minivan leader by continuing to offer the best vehicles and the best values, said James Holden, Chrylser's executive vice president of sales and marketing. &quot;This programme helps us do that.&quot;</p>
