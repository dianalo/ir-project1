<p>King Hussein of Jordan flew to self-ruled Gaza on Sunday for talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the &quot;critical danger&quot; facing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, officials said.</p>
<p>They said the king, on his first visit to Gaza, would express support for Palestinians over a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in the volatile West Bank town of Hebron and further army withdrawals from the West Bank.</p>
<p>U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Dennis Ross was due to leave the Middle East on Sunday after failing to seal an agreement launching Palestinian self-rule in most of Hebron.</p>
<p>Ross said in Cairo on Saturday the two sides had resolved their disputes over Hebron itself. But Palestinians insist Israel fulfil a 1995 commitment on the next stage of military pull-backs from the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;We support the Palestinian National Authority's position and we feel that they have offered all they can to save the process,&quot; a Jordanian official said. &quot;We do not accept the concept of the Israeli government renegotiating accords which have already been signed.&quot;</p>
<p>Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel, which ended a 46-year state of war, led to warm ties between the two countries. But King Hussein, Israel's closest Arab ally in the months following the accord, has distanced himself from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his tough line in peace moves.</p>
<p>Jordan fears Netanyahu's pledge to support Jewish settlers in the West Bank and the 10-month delay in withdrawing from Hebron -- a flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian violence -- could spark conflict which would spill across the border into Jordan.</p>
<p>&quot;The peace process is in critical danger and we want to see how we can help,&quot; the official said. &quot;This does not only affect the Palestinians.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinians, who fled to Jordan after Israel's creation in 1948 and the following Arab-Israeli wars, are widely thought to form a majority of Jordan's population.</p>
<p>&quot;If you drop a stone in the West Bank, we feel the ripples in Jordan,&quot; a senior government official said recently.</p>
<p>King Hussein and Arafat have a history of uneasy relations, but Arab frustration with Netanyahu appears to have brought them closer together.</p>
<p>The king became the first Arab head of state to visit the Palestinian self-ruled areas when he visited Arafat in Jericho last October. It was his first visit to the West Bank since Israel seized it from Jordanian rule in the Six Day War of 1967.</p>
<p>The two leaders are expected to have Iftar together, the meal at dusk which Moslems take after fasting during daylight hours in the holy month of Ramadan.</p>
