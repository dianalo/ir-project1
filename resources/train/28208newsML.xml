<p>Kankaku Research Institute Inc said on Monday in a revision of its forecast of major Japanese companies' earnings that it expected their current profits this business year to next March 31 to rise 6.8 percent from the year before.</p>
<p>It said the companies' current profits were expected to rise a further 7.9 percent in the 1997/98 business year.</p>
<p>The survey by the institute, an affiliate of Kankaku Securities Co Ltd, covered 304 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>The institute had said in June that major companies' current profits would rise 5.2 percent year-on-year in 1996/97 and by 8.4 percent in 1997/98.</p>
<p>The upward revision in its profit forecast for 1996/97 is due to the weaker trend in the yen and robust demand for office automation equipment, it said.</p>
<p>The lowered profit forecast for 1997/98 is because of the upward revision in its 1996/97 profit forecast, it said.</p>
<p>Kankaku Research issues its corporate earnings forecasts four times a year.</p>
<p>Current profit is pre-tax but includes gains and losses made on securities investments and other non-operating activities.</p>
