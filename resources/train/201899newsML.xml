<p>Houston Rockets centre Hakeem Olajuwon was hospitalized on Tuesday at halftime of a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves because of what doctors said was an irregular heartbeat.</p>
<p>Rockets' spokesman Tim Frank said Olajuwon's condition was not thought to be serious, but he had been sent to Methodist Hospital for tests and would likely stay there overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;At halftime, he came in and got a drink of water and felt a little jumpiness in his chest. The doctors looked at him and told him there was a little bit of a bad rhythm to his heart. We took him to the hospital at that point,&quot; Frank told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;They're going to do a couple of more tests on him tonight. It's not believed to be anything serious,&quot; he said. Olajuwon had the same problem in 1991, Frank said.</p>
<p>Television reports showed Olajuwon emerging from an ambulance at the hospital and walking in under his own power.</p>
<p>Methodist Hospital spokeswoman Angela McPike said that Olajuwon was &quot;doing okay,&quot; but that his heartbeat had not yet returned to normal.</p>
<p>Rockets' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said he was hoping for a quick recovery for his superstar, but, &quot;We don't know if it's going to be a couple of days or a couple of weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Olajuwon, who led the Rockets to National Basketball Association championships in 1993-94 and 1994-95 and was a member of the U.S. Dream Team in the Summer Olympics, scored 10 points in 18 minutes in the first half of Tuesday's game and appeared to be in good condition. The Rockets improved their record to 9-1 with a 122-93 win over Minnesota.</p>
