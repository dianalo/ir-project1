<title>JAPAN: Ministry raps Japan airline for late hijack report.</title>
<headline>Ministry raps Japan airline for late hijack report.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-01-21</dateline>

<p>Japanese aviation authorities rapped All Nippon Airways on Tuesday for a major safety breach, saying it took the company nearly 30 minutes to report the brief hijacking of one of its planes on Monday.</p>
<p>A drunken passenger wielding a kitchen knife hijacked an ANA aircraft on an internal flight.</p>
<p>The man, who entered the cockpit during the flight, was quickly overpowered by the crew as he tried to leave the landed aircraft. No one was injured.</p>
<p>Aviation authorities first announced that the plane was hijacked 10 minutes before its scheduled landing time of 6.50 p.m. (0930 GMT) in Fukuoka, but the ministry later learned that the first hijack signal reached the ground 26 minutes earlier through a digital transmission by the pilot.</p>
<p>&quot;We strongly reprimanded the company (ANA) for failing to swiftly report the hijack incident, and urged them to review their security measures and look into why the man was able to carry in a fruit knife onto the plane,&quot; Transport Minister Makoto Koga told a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Normally, the pilot would try to contact the control tower rather than the company office, but with the hijacker in the cockpit, the pilot may have been trying to use the most inconspicuous way to contact ground controllers, an ANA spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought of waiting to confirm it (the hijack) before reporting (to the authorities) because the emergency signal could easily be released by mistake,&quot; Masanori Kurihara of ANA Fukuoka Branch told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company promised to look further into the case and report its findings to the Transport Ministry.</p>
<p>Japan's last hijacking also involved a plane operated by ANA, the country's second-largest airline.</p>
<p>In the June 1995 incident, a Japanese ex-banker used an ice pick to commandeer an ANA plane about 30 minutes after it took off from Tokyo.</p>
<p>It only took two minutes for the control tower to learn of the hijacking after the pilot sent an emergency signal and a verbal radio message to the company's control centre.</p>
