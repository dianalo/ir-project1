<text>
<p>Dutch natural gas distributor Gasunie said on Friday it had struck two long-term deals with Italy's SNAM worth a total of around 19 billion guilders ($9.6 billion).</p>
<p>Gasunie said it had agreed to deliver more than 80 billion cubic metres of natural gas to SNAM, the gas subsidiary of state energy group ENI, from the year 2000.</p>
<p>It had also prolonged a present contract with SNAM, which was due to expire in 2009, by six years, adding another 40 billion cubic metres to the contract.</p>
<p>&quot;Together, these two contracts total 120 billion cubic metres and based on present energy prices they represent a value of about 19 billion guilders,&quot; Gasunie said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gasunie is 50 percent owned by the Dutch state, with 25 percent stakes held by Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Exxon.</p>
<p>The new 80 billion cubic metre contract starts in the year 2000 and is expected to expire in 2020.</p>
<p>At present the Netherlands supplies about six billion cubic metres of natural gas a year to Italy and within a few years this will increase to an annual figure of 10 billion, it said.</p>
<p>The gas will be delivered via Germany and Switzerland to Italy and involve an expansion of Gasunie's present distribution network, which does not have the capacity to take the new deal.</p>
