<p>The Scottish Investment Trust Plc said on Tuesday it had raised net asset value per share by 8.3 percent in the six months to end-April, with total assets up 45 million sterling at 1.07 billion.</p>
<p>The independently managed trust said the NAV increase compared to a 9.9 percent rise in the UK index and a 6.2 percent increase in the world index.</p>
<p>It also said it had repaid a 30.3 million sterling five year dollar loan and increased its interim dividend by 5.1 percent to 2.06 pence.</p>
<p>Chairman Angus Grossart said the general upward trend in world equity markets had continued, with the best performing areas being emerging markets, the U.S. and Europe. Over the last twelve months it added 33.3 million sterling to quoted investments in these areas.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the last five years our NAV has grown by 76 percent compared to a 65 percent rise in our benchmark UK index,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the half-year income figure was lower for the first half due to large special dividend income in 1996 but expected to report a &quot;satisfactory&quot; earnings result for the full year.</p>
<p>With further strength in the UK, U.S. and continental Europe and additional weakness in Japan in the period, SIT added a net 13.9 million sterling to quoted equities.</p>
<p>The main movements were additions of 10 million in Europe and 9.9 million in the U.S. and reductions of 9.6 million in the Far East.</p>
<p>&quot;Our UK portfolio has continued to do well and benefited from additional investments of 10.9 million which we made in banks and life assurance companies, further increasing our overweight position in the financial sector.&quot;</p>
<p>He said a sound fundamental outlook for the U.S. economy was encouraging for world markets in general, and it planned to use available cash resources of 35.9 million sterling to take advantage of market corrections.</p>
