<p>He added he is currently interviewing candidates for director of high-yield research and hopes to fill that position in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>The firm also plans to add an additional one or two salespersons to its high-yield sales force, which currently consists of six, Shenfeld said.</p>
<p>Brostowski worked at Salomon for the past 10 years, where he served in various positions in the firm's trading, research at sales departments.</p>
<p>Calls to Salomon Brothers Inc were not immediately returned.</p>
<p>BankBoston's new high-yield group recently opened for business after the bank received Section 20 underwriting powers several weeks ago, said Shenfeld.</p>
