<p>Prospects that China may buy copper for its strategic stockpile helped drive the price to its highest since the Sumitomo Corp scandal last June on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders also cited technical factors in the brisk rally by the London Metal Exchange (LME) flagship copper contract.</p>
<p>It rose sharply in early trading as speculative buy-stops and waves of short covering were triggered after it broke above the earlier 1997 high of $2,313 a tonne.</p>
<p>Three months delivery copper raced to an 8-1/2 month peak of $2,360 for a gain of almost $75 from Tuesday afternoon. It eased on profit-taking but closed the afternoon London session firm at $2,340.</p>
<p>Traders said the move up was made against a backdrop of renewed nearby tightness and expectations that China might buy copper to replenish strategic stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some concern that there will be a rush of Chinese demand...&quot; said brokerage GNI Ltd.</p>
<p>Values are the strongest since the throes of a price collapse that accompanied the dismissal by Japan's Sumitomo Corp of its star copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka.</p>
<p>Hamanaka, on trial in Tokyo for forgery and fraud, was alleged by the Japanese firm to have lost it $2.6 billion in maverick trades.</p>
<p>He had been the mastermind of the world trade in copper. A hoard of stocks that he controlled kept prices high and his exit triggered a collapse from around $2,700 per tonne. &quot;It's very tight moving into the peak demand period of March-June,&quot; said analyst Robin Bahr of brokers Brandeis in a comment on the present rebound.</p>
<p>&quot;A rising market creates fear. People will buy because they don't want to miss the boat. You tend to get restocking...&quot; he added. Copper's surge fuelled parallel rallies in nearly all of the other base metals. Aluminium matched the gains in copper and moved to end the day above resistance at $1,600 a tonne.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in commodity markets, coffee prices were again under pressure as selling continued to hit a rally that had taken them up by around 50 percent in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Speculative liquidation was renewed on the London market for Robusta grades of coffee beans after further weakness in the Arabica futures that are traded in New York on Tuesday.</p>
<p>London May futures for the lower quality Robustas had hit $1,705 per tonne on Friday. On Wednesday they dropped as low at $1,460 before edging up slightly towards the close.</p>
<p>Gold continued to firm to a London afternoon fixing of $346.25 per ounce, recovering in subdued activity from recent 3-3/4 year lows. Most other commodities were little changed with crude oil just firmer.</p>
