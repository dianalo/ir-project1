<p>The United States will try to keep alive a proposal banning military flights over Cyprus despite opposition by the government in Nicosia, a senior official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We were very disappointed that the parties were not able to conclude the measure, which has been on the table in different forms since July 1996,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;Nonetheless, we'll continue to work with all the parties ... on this proposal,&quot; he said, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;We're not going to stop our efforts to suggest that this is the best way forward -- a moratorium that would increase the level of confidence on the part of all the actors in the region, and give some diplomatic space, some quiet space, for the negotiators to work on these problems without resort to threats.&quot;</p>
<p>The administration was encouraged on the proposal by &quot;some positive statements&quot; heard when U.S. envoy Carey Cavanaugh was in Nicosia, Ankara and Athens last week, Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not have ironclad assurances that this agreement would be reached last week. But we had positive signals that they could accept it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Washington revived the proposed moratorium on military flights over Cyprus by Greek and Turkish aircraft after Cyprus decided to buy anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.</p>
<p>The deal raised new tensions with Ankara, which threatened military action to prevent deployment of the new systems.</p>
<p>Burns said the adminstration believes the moratorium &quot;offers a diplomatic alternative to the deployment of an anti-aircraft system ... and that the agreement of a moratorium perhaps makes it unnecessary to deploy the anti-aircraft system in 1998, about a year-and-a-half from now.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Cypriot Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides told reporters in Nicosia that his government could not enter an agreement with Turkey which implied that Ankara, which has occupied a third of the island since 1974, had rights over the island's airspace.</p>
<p>Turkey invaded northern Cyprus in 1974 after a coup in the capital Nicosia engineered by the military government ruling Athens at the time. Tension has risen in Cyprus since last summer when four Greek Cypriots and a Turkish Cypriot were killed in separate incidents along the U.N.-controlled buffer zone on the island.</p>
