<headline>French stocks open higher on unchanged Fed rates.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-21</dateline>

<p>French shares pushed ahead after opening with narrow gains on Wednesday, spurred on by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates unchanged, traders said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 20.36 points or 0.76 percent at 2,771.47 at 0815 GMT while the CAC-40 May futures contract was up 29 at 2,772 from Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was 700 million francs.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no volume,&quot;  a broker lamented.</p>
<p>Positive sentiment from Wall Street's gains buoyed the market but investors were staying on the sidelines as long as political risk remained a factor, ahead of France's two-round parliamentary election on May 25 and June 1.</p>
<p>CLF-Dexia France adds 2.8 percent to 551, cheered by comments on a bullish start to 1997 and a forecast of 100 billion francs of new lending by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Thomson-CSF rises 1.03 percent to 195.5 francs, helped by news of a new frigate sale to Saudi Arabia, estimated at around eight billion francs.</p>
<p>More than half the frigate's contract value would be in naval electronics, a source familiar with the deal said.</p>
<p>Seita drops 2.2 percent to 208.5 francs. The company warned of an all-out price war among cigarette makers but said Seita was ready to meet the threat. It expects to post &quot;satisfactory&quot; operating profits this year.</p>
<p>Banque Nationale de Paris rises 3.26 percent to 266. A trader said a French broker held a breakfast meeting with the bank and fund managers.</p>
<p>The share price has recently been driven up by speculation over mergers and aquisitions.</p>
<p>BNP's buyout offer of BNP-Incontinentale is being challenged by minority shareholders, assisted by corporate governance specialist Sophie L'Helias, over the terms and lack of financial information on the deal.</p>
