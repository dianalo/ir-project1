<p>An IMF decision to halt a key aid package  because of corruption and a lack of reform shook Kenya on Friday,  sending the Kenyan shilling into a slump and scaring foreign investors.</p>
<p>In the first official reaction, Central Bank Governor Micah Cheserem  called for urgent damage limitation and said the IMF had dealt a serious  blow to Kenya's international credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an unfortunate development but we must face it. We must not  condemn (the IMF). What is important is damage limitation that will  ensure the economy is not severely hurt,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The IMF said on Thursday a $205 million three-year loan, offered under  its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), was allowed to  lapse because the response of President Daniel arap Moi's government  to a July 24 deadline for change had been inadequate.</p>
<p>The Kenyan shilling opened at 59/59.50 to the dollar but weakened  to 60/62.50 in 20 minutes. By noon (0900 GMT), the shilling was trading  at an average of 62 to the dollar and 100 to sterling from 58.92 and  96.6 respectively on Thursday.</p>
<p>Cheserem said the central bank was weighing intervening to back the  shilling but it was not prudent to attempt to stop a stampede because  it might only add to the shilling's weakness.</p>
<p>He said he was concerned at the domino effect of the IMF decision  with worries over reaction from the World Bank, foreign bilateral  donors, inflation and possible tax increases.</p>
<p>Analysts estimated the IMF move would cost Kenya hundreds of millions  of dollars in lost investment and foreign bilateral donors would also  have a reason to cut aid to the country.</p>
<p>The IMF turned down a request from Moi's government for more time  to try to take measures to meet IMF concerns about corruption and  its demands for reform of the energy sector.</p>
<p>At the Nairobi Stock Exchange, brokers watched an empty board for  deals by foreigners. &quot;Foreign investors don't want to put their money  into a sea of uncertainty,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the pressure was on from the IMF. If the government had called  their bluff, no one in Kenya would believe the IMF had teeth,&quot; said  a top market analyst who declined to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;Short term foreign investors will leave mainly because they are people  who do not necessary know the country too well and are coming in on  the basis of an IMF programme,&quot; he added. &quot;The lack of an IMF programme  in Kenya is fundamental for them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We had made strong gains in the field of economic reform in the last  few years and that IMF decision will take us back two to three steps,&quot;  said John Munge, managing director at leading brokerage house Shah,  Munge &amp; Partners.</p>
<p>Kenya's opposition hailed the IMF decision, saying it would hit projects  and foreign investment but damage was necessary to pressure the government  into reforms before a general election this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very pleased the IMF has finally recognised the enormous problem  of governance in this country,&quot; said Richard Leakey, secretary-general  of the unregistered Safina party which campaigned for political reforms  and against corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been asking the IMF for a very long time to take this measure  and obviously it will hit a lot of projects,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;Corruption  was absolutely central to the IMF decision.&quot;</p>
<p>An opposition-backed alliance campaigning for political reforms has  called for a nationwide general strike on August 8 to put more pressure  on Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years.</p>
<p>In an editorial written before news of the IMF decision, the independent  Daily Nation newspaper said on Friday the IMF clearly believed the  government was loathe to punish corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;The perception in the donor community is that the government has  played hide and seek with the IMF over the Goldenberg scam,&quot; said  the Nation, referring to a multi-million dollar financial scandal  involving Goldenberg International.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the reason why there is reluctance to punish corruption  in government is that it is highly placed people who are involved...Such  highly placed people are involved in corruption because they know  they will go scott-free,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The IMF has focused on the Goldenberg scandal to illustrate how authorities  were wary about cracking down on corruption.</p>
<p>Goldenberg International was paid about $100 million by the government  in 1992 under a compensation scheme for gold and diamond exports.  Kenya produces little gold and no diamonds.</p>
<p>The opposition had cited alleged links to powerful Kenyan politicians  as the main reason why the case dragged on.</p>
