<p>Packaging materials maker Cofinec S.A. reported a 1996 pre-tax loss of 60.3 million French francs on lower sales and higher operating costs, the company said.</p>
<p>Operating expenses for the French-registered company were 114.7 million FF in 1996, up from 98.9 million in 1995, according to preliminary results prepared under IAS standards.</p>
<p>Operating profit was 8.6 million FF, a drop of 88.2 percent from 72.5 million in 1995, due largely to deterioriation in gross margins and start-up costs for a Polish unit, the company said. The group's 1995 pre-tax profit was 35.4 million FF.</p>
<p>The company said 1996 results reflect 34 million FF in provisions plus an 18 million FF previously announced profit warning.</p>
<p>Consolidated sales totalled 664.8 million FF in 1996, a 1.3 percent decrease from 673.4 million FF in 1995. Increased competition from packaging companies based outside Cofinec's east Europe base area were largely to blame, the company said.</p>
<p>The company, which launched an initial public offering last year with listings on the Budapest and Luxembourg stock exchanges, said 1996 had been &quot;a significant transition year&quot;.</p>
<p>It said proceeds of the IPO had been used for debt repayment, buying the outstanding 50 percent stake in its Czech subsidiary Krpaco, a capital increase for COFINEC Polska and for working capital.</p>
<p>The company also went through a management upheaval with the resignation of its chief executive officer Stephen Frater after its share price plummeted following the IPO.</p>
<p>&quot;Management changes at the board and headquarter levels following the IPO have increased the industrial focus of the company,&quot; the Cofinec statement said. It said a restructuring plan would create a &quot;leaner, more efficient organisation&quot;.</p>
<p>The statement added that &quot;1996 was also marked by less than expected earnings...a challenging start-up period for COFINEC Polska and increased competition from the West&quot;.</p>
<p>It said there had been some signs of improvement with &quot;stronger sales in Q4 of 1996 and January 1997&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Following the extraordinary events of 1996, the company is well positioned in 1997 to benefit from its market position, competitive advantages and the synergies of its operating subsidiaries...(to) maintain its leading position in the central European packaging industry and provide for further growth in the future,&quot; ther statement said.</p>
