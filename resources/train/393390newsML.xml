<p>The Baltic Freight Index (BFI) slipped three points to stand at 1,465 on Friday.</p>

<p>Brokers reported Tomen recently fixed 54,000 tonnes heavy grain USGulf/Japan April at $25.50. On February 18 a similar fixing was noted at $25.85.</p>
<p>Biffex futures closed five to 25 points lower. The most active month April traded 25 lots and ended at 1,550. Total volume ammounted to 65 lots.</p>
<p>Freight futures look likely to attempt to move in to new high ground soon, and stop losses on April delivery can be brought up to 1,520, Investment Research of Cambridge said.</p>
