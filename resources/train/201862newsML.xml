<headline>SOCCER-EVERTON DENY LIVERPOOL TOP SPOT WITH LATE EQUALISER.</headline>
<dateline>LIVERPOOL, England 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Liverpool squandered a chance to go to the top of the English premier league on Wednesday when they allowed Everton to snatch a 1-1 draw with a late equaliser.</p>
<p>Gary Speed struck for Everton with eight minutes remaining after England striker Robbie Fowler had scored a first-half goal against the team he supported as a boy.</p>
<p>The result meant Liverpool stayed in second place on 27 points, a point behind Newcastle. Everton leapfrog over Tottenham into seventh, seven points behind their neighbours.</p>
<p>Rbbie Fowler put Liverpool ahead on the half-hour, heading home a fine cross from Jamie Rednapp for his ninth goal in seven goals since his return from injury.</p>
<p>But Everton, who put seven goals past Southampton at the weekend, fought back after the interval to stop Liverpool in their tracks with a goal from a set-piece.</p>
<p>Andy Hinchcliffe swung in a freekick and Speed, who signed for the club from Leeds for 3.5 million pounds ($5.9 million) in the close season, powered a header beyond Liverpool 'keeper David James.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a good first half where we matched them pace for pace, then set the tempo,&quot; Liverpool manager Roy Evans said. &quot;But in the second half we lost the plot. We are just forgetting to pass the ball at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>To compound Liverpool's frustration, England forward Steve McManaman limped off with a hamstring strain after just 17 minutes.</p>
<p>He was replaced by Stan Collymore, the subject of speculation over a possible move to Aston Villa earlier this week.</p>
