<p>France insisted on Tuesday that its crackdown on separatist violence in Corsica was showing results and flatly ruled out independence for the Mediterranean island following a nationalist bomb attack on the Bordeaux city hall.</p>
<p>&quot;Sooner or later those responsible for these attacks will be identified, questioned and arrested, and for many of these attacks we are not far from concluding our investigations,&quot; Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said in a broadcast interview.</p>
<p>Asked if the government ruled out offering Corsica its independence from mainland France one day, Debre responded: &quot;Totally&quot;.</p>
<p>The interview on Europe 1 radio took place a day after separatists claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on Prime Minister Alain Juppe's mayoral office in Bordeaux and an angry government vowed to put the guerrillas out of action.</p>
<p>The government vow has been greeted with some skepticism as bombings have continued at a steady pace despite earlier pledges to end violence on the sunny resort island.</p>
<p>But Debre insisted that the government policy was already working. Since January, 22 individuals implicated in separatist attacks had been imprisoned and were still in jail, he said.</p>
<p>He also ruled out a resumption of negotiations with nationalist representatives until calm was restored.</p>
<p>The &quot;historic wing&quot; of the outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) asserted responsibility on Monday for Saturday night's bombing of the Bordeaux city hall.</p>
<p>The attack, a clear escalation of the group's long-running low-intensity struggle for greater autonomy from Paris, raised the spectre of a guerrilla offensive in mainland France.</p>
<p>The FLNC has accused Juppe of going back on pledges made in secret peace talks earlier this year when he ordered a crackdown on separatist gunmen in July.</p>
