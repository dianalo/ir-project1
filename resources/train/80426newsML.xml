<p>Italian financial markets on Friday soared on a wave of euphoria that tougher than expected 1997 budget measures will thrust the nation into the front line for membership of the single European currency.</p>
<p>Analysts said bonds, the lira and shares were lifted by the centre-left government's determination to apply strict financial discipline.</p>
<p>But they hoped the Bank of Italy would act soon to cut interest rates to offset any dampening effect the harsh 1997 financial package would have on economic growth.</p>
<p>Italian domestic bonds surged early to forge historic highs, the lira held up after touching its strongest level against the German mark since early August 1994 in late trading on Thursday and shares were swept higher.</p>
<p>The government was poised on Friday to approve the 1997 budget bill, which would be one of the toughest in recent years, slashing a massive 62.5 trillion lire ($41 billion) off next year's public sector deficit - well in excess of the 32.4 trillion originally planned.</p>
<p>The budget is to include a special &quot;Euro-tax&quot; which is seen as raising 12.5 trillion lire. After cabinet approval the whole financial package must be passed by parliament by year's end.</p>
<p>&quot;The optimism is justified, the budget cuts are bigger than expected, while the big surprise is that it appears to have the support of the Communists,&quot; said Francesco Giordano senior economist at San Paolo Bank in London.</p>
<p>Italy's centre-left government led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi relies on support of the hard-left Communist Refoundation party for its majority in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>The Communists are opposed to cuts in health and pension spending, but their leader Fausto Bertinotti said on Thursday that budget talks with the government had made progress.</p>
<p>In the bond market, government bond (Btp) futures on London's LIFFE market swept away resistance levels and quickly moved into uncharted territory, as the December contract hit a record high of 122.50. The euphoria subsided by the end of the day, leaving the future up 139 basis points at 121.82.</p>
<p>Dealers and analysts said the market was consolidating after dramatic gains but there was still room for increases and a narrowing of the interest rate spread against German Bunds.</p>
<p>The lira held firm at 997.00 per mark after hitting a new high of 994.40 late Thursday, the highest level seen since August 1994.</p>
<p>Shares on the Milan bourse were also driven up with the all-share Mibtel index three percent firmer at 10,154 and the Mib30 index of Italy's 30 biggest companies up 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>The financial package aims to cut Italy's deficit to gross domestic product ratio to three percent in 1997, a key target set out in the Maastricht Treaty which must be met by European countries wanting to join a single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>The government was now talking about meeting the three percent target by 1997 for the first time after originally gunning for 1998 instead, analysts said. They said this aim was tough but not impossible to reach.</p>
<p>But analysts pointed out that interest rates would need to be cut to offset a fall in economic growth likely to result from the tough deficit-cutting budget.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey of 12 economists showed the Bank of Italy is expected to cut the official discount rate by the end of October from its current level of 8.25 percent.</p>
