<headline>Fujimori taking political advantage of raid - poll.</headline>

<p>More Peruvians believe President Alberto Fujimori ordered the military storming of the Japanese ambassador's residence out of concern for his political future than for the good of the country, a new poll showed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some 64.5 percent also said the government has exploited the attack to score political points, while only 29.3 percent disagreed, according to a survey of 400 Lima residents by local pollster Imasen.</p>
<p>The poll said 46.8 percent believed Fujimori ordered the deadly April 22 storming of Marxist hostage-takers due to &quot;concern about his political future,&quot; while 27.5 percent said the motive was &quot;what was necessary for the country.&quot;</p>
<p>The government said it was forced to strike against the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) after four months of negotiations had failed to solve the crisis peacefully.</p>
<p>Authorities have moved swiftly to deny reports that two rebels were executed during the operation and some of the guerrillas' bodies withheld from families and buried secretly.</p>
<p>While politicians and pro-government media have routinely referred to just &quot;three victims&quot; of the operation -- referring to the one captive and two soldiers who died -- 82 percent of those surveyed expressed sympathy for &quot;all the deaths,&quot; including the 14 slain guerrillas.</p>
<p>The government has also tried to use the raid to distract attention from allegations of torture, murder and intimidation by intelligence services, according to 63 percent of those polled.</p>
<p>The survey, carried out on April 26 and 27, had a 5 percent margin of error.</p>
<p>Fujimori, whose personal popularity has soared with the end of the hostage crisis, is mulling a third election bid in 2000.</p>
