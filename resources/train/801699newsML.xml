<p>South Africa's first black-owned mining house JCI Ltd confirmed on Friday that it was considering restructuring into three entities.</p>
<p>The newspaper Business Report said on Friday that JCI would be split into three separate companies -- a corporate parent unit, a gold company and a multicommodity firm.</p>
<p>JCI spokesman Marc Gonsalves said the company had made it clear in the past that it wanted to restructure and this could now go ahead after the new owners took over.</p>
<p>&quot;At the time we said that would have to await the arrival of the new owners. Clearly their arrival has now allowed that process to go forward&quot;.</p>
<p>A black empowerment group, headed by Mzi Khumalo, bought JCI from Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd earlier this year.</p>
<p>JCI announced on July 2 it would buy a 26.8 percent stake in British conglomerate Lonrho Plc previously held by Anglo for around 2.5 billion rand. The deal was yet to be approved by the European Commission.</p>
<p>Business Report quoted a letter from Khumalo to JCI staff which said the company would be split into three to create structures to ensure that management concentrates on the company's core business.</p>
<p>&quot;It has become even more clear, especially in this period of weak commodity prices, that we must cut costs in order to ensure the profitability and future growth of our operations,&quot; Khumalo said in the letter.</p>
<p>Gonsalves said the process of involving staff in the restructuring process was now well underway.</p>
<p>Khumalo said in the letter quoted by Business Report (corrects from Business Day) that it was too early to say how the company's unlisted Tavistock coal unit would fit into the restructured JCI.</p>
<p>JCI said earlier this month that it was in talks with an unnamed party in respect of the sale of Tavistock after declining to pursue an offer submitted by Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd .</p>
<p>Asked when an annoucement could be expected on Tavistock, Gonsalves said:</p>
<p>&quot;In the nature of these things, you hang yourself if you try and commit yourself to dates. We are obviously keen that this moves along as smoothly and as quickly as possible&quot;.</p>
