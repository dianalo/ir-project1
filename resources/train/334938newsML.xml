<p>The United States is considering participating in a commando-type international police force to capture accused Bosnia war criminals and bring them to trial, the White House said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an option that's under consideration,&quot; White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said when asked if the United States was considering creating a unit to arrest those indicted on charges of war crimes.</p>
<p>He stressed that President Bill Clinton had made no final decision on such a force but said the concept under study would involve a unit separate from NATO peacekeeping forces now in Bosnia.</p>
<p>While declining to identify any individual who would be the target of such a force, McCurry noted in response to a question that Bosnian Serb military leader Gen. Ratko Mladic &quot;is on the list of those who have been indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal.&quot;</p>
<p>Administration officials said the suspects would be brought before the tribunal in the Hague for prosecution.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been deeply concerned about war crimes in Bosnia and took the lead in helping the War Crimes Tribunal that is attempting to prosecute those cases,&quot; McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We've said for some time we're looking at ways of making that tribunal more effective. One possible option is to set up some type of special police force,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't made a decision on whether that's the best way to help the tribunal but it does suggest itself as an option.&quot;</p>
<p>NATO defence ministers have discussed the possibility of creating an international police force to track down those indicted for war crimes but have failed to agree on how it might be constituted.</p>
<p>Pentagon and NATO officials have repeatedly balked at the idea of expanding the duties of the current peacekeeping force -- mindful of the disastrous consequences when U.N. relief forces were ordered to take on police duties in Somalia.</p>
<p>McCurry said the United States was &quot;specifically ruling out&quot; the idea of expanding the role of the NATO stabilisation forces already in Bosnia to help maintain the peace.</p>
<p>NATO troops now in Bosnia have a mandate to arrest anyone indicted for war crimes if soldiers encounter them during the course of duty. Commanders, however, have avoided going out of their way to hunt them down.</p>
<p>Administration officials said the United States did not want to see the tribunal wither away because of its inability to bring accused criminals to trial. In a challenge to the new U.N. secretary-general, the Bosnian Serbs this month vowed not to hand over their leaders to the tribunal for trial.</p>
<p>Biljana Plavsic, president of the Bosnian Serb republic, in a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said Bosnian Serbs would not turn over Mladic or Radovan Karadzic, their former president.</p>
