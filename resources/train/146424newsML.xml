<headline>Taleban brace for assaults as warplanes hit Kabul.</headline>

<p>Anti-Taleban warplanes bombed Kabul for a second successive night as the purist Islamic militia prepared for further violent attempts to dislodge them from the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>Barrages of anti-aircraft fire lit the night sky as the warplanes struck. Three bombs apparently landed on the city, two hours after curfew, but it was not immediately clear what they hit.</p>
<p>Warplanes, identified by the Taleban as belonging to northern Uzbek leader Abdul Rashid Dostum, had already raided the capital twice on Saturday night and again on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The latest aerial assault came after a day of heavy fighting to the north of Kabul as the combined forces of Dostum and the former government army of ousted military chief Ahmad Shah Masood tried to advance on the city.</p>
<p>Their immediate objective was the De Sabz pass, about 30 km (20 miles) north of Kabul, but Taleban forces appeared to hold their ground, beating off assaults by rockets, artillery and warplanes.</p>
<p>Repeated attacks last week in the same area failed to shift the Islamic warriors.</p>
<p>&quot;We captured the high points which were planned,&quot; Dr Abdullah, spokesman for Masood, told reporters in the town of Jabal Os-Siraj, 90 km (60 miles) north of Kabul. &quot;But the whole pass has not been secured.&quot;</p>
<p>Control of the De Sabz pass would give Masood and Dostum a relatively clear run over gently undulating land to the edge of the Kabul valley.</p>
<p>Masood and Dostum, formerly bitter foes, have allied to try to oust the Taleban from Kabul, which the radical Islamic militiamen seized a month ago.</p>
<p>Dostum had delayed committing his forces until recently but once it became clear he had sided with Masood the Taleban attacked his northern stronghold, opening up another front in a bid to divert the Uzbek leader's forces from advancing on Kabul.</p>
<p>Taleban-controlled Afghan Radio has made unconfirmed claims that the militia has captured the remote northwestern province of Badghis.</p>
<p>The heavy fighting and night raids -- the first on Kabul in 17 years of civil war -- also signalled ceasefire talks brokered by Pakistan and the United Nations had failed.</p>
<p>Hopes of concerted regional action to bring about peace were further dimmed when Pakistan said it would not attend a conference on the Afghan crisis to be hosted by Iran this week.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been accused of backing the Taleban, whose strict Sunni Moslem ideology antagonises Shi'ite Moslem Iran, and the two countries vie for influence in Afghanistan.</p>
