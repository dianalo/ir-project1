<headline>N. Carolina seeks advice on intangibles tax rule.</headline>

<p>A complicated North Carolina Supreme Court ruling has prompted the state revenue department to seek legal advice on whether to refund intangibles tax payments made before the tax was repealed.</p>
<p>The state supreme court ruled Monday that the state does not have to refund the money. The ruling said that instead, the state could seek back taxes from taxpayers who got the exemptions that made the tax illegal.</p>
<p>The ruling caused so much confusion that &quot;we're kind of in a stationary mode,&quot; revenue department spokesman Don Reuter said Tuesday.</p>
<p>State Revenue Secretary Muriel Offerman, said she had asked the state attorney general's office to &quot;analyze the ruling thoroughly and provide this department with an explanation of the ruling and legal advice on how to proceed.&quot;</p>
<p>The intangibles tax was levied on stocks, bonds and other securities at the rate of 25 cents for every $100 worth of stock. The rate was reduced in proportion to the amount of business that the company issuing the stock conducted in North Carolina. Stocks in companies operating solely within the state were exempt.</p>
<p>A Greensboro company, the Fulton Corp, sued in 1990, claiming the tax unconstitutionally impeded interstate commerce because the stock of in-state and out-of-state companies were taxed at different rates.</p>
<p>While the lawsuit was still winding through the courts, the state legislature repealed the tax as of Jan 1, 1995.</p>
<p>In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court said the tax was unconstitutional because it discriminated against companies according to where they did business.</p>
<p>The state Revenue Department had proposed issuing $123 million of refunds to those who paid the tax under protest between the time the lawsuit was filed and the time of the repeal.</p>
<p>But the refunds were put on hold because the U.S. Supreme Court sent the case back to the state supreme court to recommend a remedy.</p>
<p>In a 4-3 decision Monday, the state supreme court said that the intangibles tax itself was legal, but that the exemptions given to investors in North Carolina companies were illegal.</p>
<p>The court refused to order refunds. But it said the General Assembly could remedy the inequality by retroactively seeking payment at the full rate from those who got the exemptions.</p>
<p>Or, the court said, the General Assembly could forgive the tax, something the court lacked authority to do.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Leo Daughtry told the News &amp; Observer that a retroactive tax was unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;Politically, it is not something we are going to do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The General Assembly could still order refunds, if it finds a way to pay for them. But the ruling did not address whether any potential refunds should cover only those who paid under protest after the lawsuit was filed, or everyone who paid after the suit was filed.</p>
<p>The latter would bring the amount due to be refunded to $353 million, plus interest.</p>
<p>State Attorney General Mike Easely was unavailable for comment.</p>
