<p>Japan's leading public utilities have decided to increase electricity and gas rates this spring, citing climbing fuel costs and the scheduled rise in consumption tax, industry officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 10 major power utility companies will increase electricity rates by between 35 yen and 95 yen per month for the average household from April to reflect higher fuel costs, a spokesman for the Federation of Electric Power Companies said.</p>
<p>Electricity rates will rise by another 130 to 140 yen from May because of the rise in consumption tax, he said. The tax is being raised to five percent from three percent on April 1.  </p>
<p>The step comes despite growing calls by the government for the industry to try to cut electricity rates to bring them in line with international levels.</p>
<p>Japan's four major gas companies will also raise gas rates by 100 to 120 yen per month for the average household from April, a Japan Gas Association spokesman said.</p>
<p>Gas rates will increase by another 130 to 160 yen from May due to the consumption tax increase, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Japan has about 244 gas companies nationwide, but the four big companies -- Tokyo Gas Co Ltd, Osaka Gas Co Ltd, Toho Gas Co Ltd and Saibu Gas Co Ltd -- together supply about 70 percent of the nation's households.</p>
