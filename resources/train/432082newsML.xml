<p>France's Pathe on Monday declined comment on a British newspaper report that it might sell its 17 percent stake in British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSkyB).</p>
<p>However, a Pathe spokesman said the company was satisfied with the performance of BSkyB and with its cooperation with the British satellite television company.</p>
<p>The Sunday Telegraph said Pathe might sell the stake, valued at 1.8 billion pounds. The stake represented too much money tied up in one asset for Pathe, the paper said.</p>
<p>&quot;These are rumours of purely journalistic origin. Pathe does not wish to comment on rumours published by a British newspaper,&quot; the Pathe spokesman said.</p>
<p>Pathe was &quot;very satisfied with the performance and its cooperation with BSkyB,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pathe shares surged on the Paris bourse on the newspaper report. They were 106 francs higher at 1,524 francs at 1102 GMT.</p>
<p>Pathe, created from the break up of Chargeurs last year, is due to publish its 1996 results on Tuesday after the Paris bourse close at 1600 GMT.</p>
