<headline>German wheat up on EU export restraint, weather.</headline>
<dateline>HAMBURG 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>German wheat from the new and old crops has been marked up as other European countries react to drought damage and after the European Union rejected all bids to export grain last week, brokers said.</p>
<p>Firm Chicago wheat prices, buoyed by U.S. weather concerns, were also cited as supportive amid good global demand.</p>
<p>Brokers said prices in Spain, Italy, southern France and the south of England had risen because of drought problems.</p>
<p>Northern German export regions reported dwindling old crop supplies which should keep prices firm over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Some milling and feed industry demand was in the pipeline from all European centres and sizeable volumes of 12 percent protein wheat had recently been sold to southern Europe.</p>
<p>The Hamburg grain exchange this week raised its spot bread wheat price (12.5 percent, 220 Hagberg) by 2.50 marks to 285 marks a tonne free Hamburg.</p>
<p>It also raised the feed wheat price by 2.50 marks to 280. Traders cited spillover from firm British and Danish markets.</p>
<p>Fob Baltic sellers raised April delivery wheat by between 1.50 and 7.50 marks per tonne on the week.</p>
<p>They quoted 12 percent protein wheat at 286.50-303.50 marks and material with 13/14 percent protein in a 291.50-320 marks range.</p>
<p>Limited fob Baltic barley offers were at 273.50 marks spot while rye sellers were at 265-275.</p>
<p>New crop wheat fob Baltic was offered in a 285-307.50 marks range and fob Rostock at 292.50-315, depending on dates, quality and shipment sizes.</p>
