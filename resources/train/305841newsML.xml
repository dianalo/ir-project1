<p>One of six inmates who tunneled out of a maximum-security prison and escaped last week was arrested in Texas, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Thomas Berkelbaugh, 48, a convicted armed robber, was arrested in a bus terminal in Houston after he was spotted there talking to himself, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;He blurted out that he was an escapee from prison&quot; when he was confronted by police, said Lt. Don McWilliams of the Houston Police Department.</p>
<p>A manhunt has been underway for Berkelbaugh and five other men after they escaped last week from the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, a facility with more than 1,800 inmates. The men escaped by tunneling their way out.</p>
<p>The five other inmates were still at large. Two of them were convicted murderers.</p>
<p>Berkelbaugh was being held in jail in Houston.</p>
