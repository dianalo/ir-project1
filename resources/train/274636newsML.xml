<p>Ethiopian troops advancing in southwestern Somalia seized three border villages, beating back Somali Moslem fundamentalist fighters, a security source in the region said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The source, reached by radio from the capital Mogadishu, said Ethiopian troops were six km (four miles) from the village of Beled Hawo on the road to the fundamentalist stronghold of Luq, more than 100 km (60 miles) from the Ethiopian border.</p>
<p>Ahmed Bile Hassan, a spokesman in Mogadishu for al-Ittihad al-Islami (Islamic Union), said its fighters made a &quot;tactical retreat&quot; on Monday night after inflicting heavy losses on the Ethiopians.</p>
<p>He declined to give casualty figures but the security source said al-Ittihad's fighters were pushed back in bitter fighting.</p>
<p>Al-Ittihad accused Ethiopian troops and tanks of seizing the border town of Dolow last Tuesday and pushing 20 km (12 miles) into Somalia. There has been no comment from Ethiopia on the reports.</p>
<p>An aid worker said on Tuesday Ethiopian troops were in Dolow but he had not heard of fighting there for the past two days. He said the soldiers were repairing a bridge wrecked last August.</p>
<p>Al-Ittihad said on Monday its militiamen killed more than 70 Ethiopian troops on Saturday at a cost of 19 dead.</p>
<p>Dolow, 500 km (300 miles) northwest of Mogadishu, and Beled Hawo were two of the three settlements seized by Ethiopian troops in a two-day incursion last August to hit al-Ittihad's bases.</p>
<p>Ethiopia said then it might have to hit what it called the &quot;multinational terrorist group&quot; in Somalia again in the future.</p>
