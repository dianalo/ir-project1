<p>Nafis Sadik, Pakistani head of the United Nations Population Fund and a former hospital doctor, announced on Monday she would be bidding to take charge of the World Health Organisation (WHO) when the job falls vacant next year.</p>
<p>Sadik, who played a key role in reconciling supporters and opponents of contraception at the U.N. population conference in Cairo in 1995, joins former Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland in the race for the post.</p>
<p>&quot;I hate to think that this might become a political contest....I hope governments will judge us not on where we come from but on our competence and skills,&quot; she told reporters after her announcement, issued through Pakistan's mission in Geneva.</p>
<p>The move came at the start of the WHO's two-week annual assembly and a week after the agency's controversial current Director-General, Hiroshi Nakajima of Japan, said he would step down in July 1998 at the end of two five-year terms.</p>
<p>A statement from the Pakistani mission said it was time that the post -- for 25 years held by richer powers -- went to &quot;an eminent person from the developing countries which constitute a majority of its (the WHO's) membership&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, since no U.N. agency which chooses its own chief had ever been run by a woman, &quot;it is now time that the WHO should be headed by a woman from a developing country&quot;, the statement added.</p>
<p>Brundtland, like Sadik a medical doctor by training, said early last month she would like the job if Nakajima -- long under fire from Western countries for his management style and personnel policies -- stepped down.</p>
<p>The United States, one of his fiercest critics, has publicly greeted Nakajima's decision diplomatically, hailing in a formal statement the &quot;important contribution&quot; he has made to the agency since his appointment in 1988.</p>
<p>But U.S. Secretary of Health Donna Shalala told the WHO assembly on Monday that Washington wanted &quot;a director-general who can find new ways of meeting new health challenges&quot;, including educating the world public in the danger from smoking.</p>
<p>&quot;We need someone who will be a passionate advocate for health, including environmental and women's health,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;He or she must send a clear message to every political and financial leader. There can be no effective social or economic development without good health.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident I meet all these requirements,&quot; said the partly U.S.-trained Sadik, who has headed the Population Fund since 1987 after five years as its deputy chief. &quot;I think my record speaks for me on that.&quot;</p>
<p>In its annual world health report issued on Monday, the 191-member WHO said cancer cases were expected to double globally over the next 25 years. The most worrying trend was the number of women developing lung and breast cancer.</p>
<p>Circulatory ailments, including heart attacks and strokes, will also continue to rise -- especially as people in developing countries adopt unhealthy habits like smoking and sedentary lifestyles, the report declared.</p>
<p>The WHO has frequently warned that as smoking declines in many richer states, it is increasing in emerging economies partly due to high-power advertising by big tobacco companies seeking new markets to compensate.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said Washington had as yet no preferred candidate. In her speech, Shalala said the job should go to a leader &quot;with a commitment to the most vulnerable citizens and the countries in greatest need&quot;.</p>
<p>The choice will effectively be made in January next year at a session of the WHO's 32-member Executive Board, although the recommended candidate will then have to be endorsed by the full membership at the 1998 assembly in May.</p>
