<headline>SOCCER-BELGIAN STRIKER FACES TRIAL FOR HEAD-BUTTING NURSE.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-12-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Belgian court ruled on Monday that soccer international Gilles De Bilde must stand trial for assault after head-butting one male nurse and punching another last year.</p>
<p>&quot;He has been referred to the correctional court,&quot; Brussels public prosecutor's office spokesman Jos Colpin told Reuters. He said any appeal was likely to be rejected.</p>
<p>Anderlecht striker De Bilde, who won the 1994 award for best Belgian league player, attacked the nurses when he was denied access to a hospital room where his father was being treated for a heart attack in August 1995.</p>
<p>He also kicked the ambulance on its arrival at his father's home because he thought it took too long to get there.</p>
<p>One of the nurses was temporarily unable to work after the attack, Colpin said</p>
