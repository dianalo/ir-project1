<title>FRANCE: Chirac to wish gloomy France a happy New Year.</title>

<p>President Jacques Chirac will be struggling to give gloomy French citizens reasons to believe in a brighter future when he broadcasts his traditional New Year message to the nation on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It will be Chirac's second television appearance in less than a month.</p>
<p>In a lengthy interview on December 12, he appealed for understanding for the centre-right government's austerity policies but failed to boost his low popularity significantly. Recent opinion polls have shown only a slight rise in his approval rating and that of his embattled prime minister, Alain Juppe.</p>
<p>French presidents usually say little of substance in their New Year messages, which last just a few minutes and are broadcast just before the evening news programmes.</p>
<p>Chirac will be eager to boost national morale at the end of a year which, according to the conservative, pro-government daily Le Figaro, has been a dark one for France.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment has not dropped, poverty has not been defeated, the weight of public services and taxes has not been lightened,&quot; wrote Figaro columnist Jean d'Ormesson. &quot;And French people are not happy.&quot;</p>
<p>While attempting to convince viewers that better times lie ahead, Chirac should also use Tuesday's address to try to correct a personal image which, according to former presidential adviser Bernard Rideau, is a poor one.</p>
<p>&quot;Chirac seems transfixed (by the media)&quot;, Rideau, former media adviser to ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, told the daily Liberation in an interview on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;He says himself that he does not like television. He appears likeable and close to the people's problems...but he fails to appear as a man with an experience of power and competence,&quot; Rideau added.</p>
