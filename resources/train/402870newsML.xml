<p>The global depositary receipt offering of Egypt's only brewery, al-Ahram Beverages, was 7.5 times oversubscribed and the GDRs were sold at $15.50 each, the local agent for the sale said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hamdy el-Rashad, chairman of El-Rashad Securities Brokerage, told Reuters the GDRs have been trading on London's SEAQ index for at least a week and sources close to the deal said they jumped $5 on the first day of trading.</p>
<p>Two GDRs are equivalent to one al-Ahram share.</p>
<p>On Monday the U.S.-based Luxor Group transferred over 3.1 million al-Ahram shares to Bankers Trust in London for the GDR.</p>
<p>Data from the Capital Market Authority showed that the transfer formality took place at about 68.50 pounds a share -- the price at which the Luxor Group bought the shares from the Egyptian government on privatisation last year.</p>
<p>The shares have since risen in market value to close on Monday at 149.00 pounds a share.</p>
<p>Rashad said the Luxor Group now owns five percent of al-Ahram's equity in Egyptian shares and another 7.5 percent in GDRs. It is not allowed to sell the Egyptian shares for at least five years, he added.</p>
<p>International securities house HSBC James Capel is the lead manager for the issue and Nomura Securities are also involved in the deal, the local agents said this month.</p>
<p>Al-Ahram Beverages, also known as Pyramids Breweries, is now the only operating brewer in Egypt but two other companies have plans to set up in competition.</p>
<p>The GDR offering will be the third by an Egyptian firm within a year. Commercial International Bank (CIB) was the first to issue GDRs, currently listed in London, and then the state decided to sell part of its stake in Suez Cement via another London-listed GDR. Misr International Bank/MIBANK is also planning a GDR offering soon.</p>
<p>Brokers said that the GDRs were all trading at a discount of about 14 to 20 percent to the price of the stock in Egypt.</p>
