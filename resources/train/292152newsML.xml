<p>Belgian airline Sabena and its partners Swissair, Austrian Airlines and Delta Air Lines will step up cooperation for transatlantic flights from next month, Sabena said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This means a closer cooperation,&quot; Sabena spokesman Erik Sclep told Reuters. He said the plan was also part of Sabena's cost-cutting drive which included an increase of synergies with partners.</p>
<p>Sabena chief executive Paul Reutlinger told an informal briefing on Monday the four partners would have a common management of transatlantic flights, coordinate fares and seating, and share profit and cost from February 1.</p>
<p>&quot;We try to operate our flights between Belgium, Austria, Switzerland and the U.S. as one enterprise,&quot; said Reutlinger, who also announced that the four carriers would impose a global smoking ban on all transatlantic routes from March 30.</p>
<p>Reutlinger also said that Sabena was planning to raise the total number of routes to 70 from 60.</p>
<p>Sabena will open a new route to Cincinatti, Ohio, from May 15. It is planning five flights a week. Cincinatti, Delta's second hub, will allow Sabena to serve more than 50 U.S. cities.</p>
<p>Reutlinger said Sabena also wanted to add Moscow, Glasgow, Beirut and Larnaca in Cyprus, to the list.</p>
<p>&quot;Moscow is one of the places we would like to go to. Market research will be finalised in January and, if we decide to go ahead, the route should be open in the course of 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Loss-making Sabena, owned 49.5 percent by Swissair, has said the first six months of 1997 will be crucial for its future.</p>
<p>The carrier, which had a first-half 1996 loss of two billion francs ($62.2 million), is under pressure to restore confidence of Swissair, which has threatened to write off its 6.5 billion francs ($202.2 million) investment in the Belgian airline.</p>
<p>Swissair wants a return on capital employed of four percent by 1998.</p>
<p>Sabena, badly hit by a series of strikes early last year which undermined passengers' confidence in the airline, has been regaining market share in recent months but the seat occupancy rate in Europe has remained below par.</p>
<p>Its 1996 passenger traffic rose 3.2 percent to 5.16 million but the rise -- below market average -- was entirely due to the second half after a disappointing first half.</p>
<p>Reutlinger said Sabena is further studying plans to relocate its pilots to a foreign country to avoid having to pay heavy Belgian social security levies. The measure should help save Sabena 1.5 billion francs ($46.7 million) per year.</p>
<p>Sabena pilots could be relocated to Switzerland, which has an average income tax of 15 to 20 percent against 40 to 55 percent in Belgium. Britain is also an option.</p>
<p>&quot;We face liberalisation of air transport, but we're not fighting with the same weapons, other carriers have a fiscal advantage,&quot; Sclep said.</p>
<p>Sabena is also considering extending its cooperation with Richard Branson's low-cost Virgin Express regional airline to save costs.</p>
<p>The two airlines already have a deal for flights between Brussels and London Heathrow and are considering similar agreements for the routes to Rome and Barcelona although Sabena pilots are sceptical of any further approach between the two airlines.</p>
<p>Reutlinger also announced that Sabena and Swissair would merge their frequent flyer programmes from April.</p>
<p>Sabena says it and Swissair would see a net gain of 750 million francs ($23.3 million) in 1997 from their synergies.</p>
