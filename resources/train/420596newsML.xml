<p>Damon Hill will go into the new Formula One world championship season knowing he has no chance of defending his hard-won crown as drivers' champion.</p>
<p>He expects no more than a few forays into the points with Arrows this season and admits it is unrealistic to envisage a podium finish among the 'big four' teams favoured to dominate the front of the grid and title race this year.</p>
<p>But the 36-year-old Briton, who lost his seat with constructors' champions Williams long before he clinched his title in Japan last year, is adamant he can help develop his new team into a future force.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, it was mainly me and Jacques in competition, with the two Williams cars, but this year you could say I will have a lot more competition,&quot; acknowledged Hill. &quot;At the moment, all that matters to me is finding out where we are starting from -- you could definitely say we have a much greater potential for improvement at Arrows than any other team in Formula One at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Talking on the eve of the new season, during final testing at Silverstone, Hill was able to laugh at his predicament, talk about a year of rebuilding and suggest he will recover a winning position in the future.</p>
<p>But behind the bold and controlled words it was easy to discern the truth -- that he still feels exasperated by his departure from Williams and that it provides the motivation which is driving him on so fiercely now.</p>
<p>&quot;My resolve to win another title is still there, but this season is going to be one of development and preparation for another challenge in the future. I am now fully committed to a new direction in my career with Arrows and it is a project I find exciting.</p>
<p>&quot;I enjoyed driving for Williams and I could be bitter and resentful about not having the opportunity to defend my championship and having to sit back and watch it taken from me, when I believe it would have been possible for me to win again.</p>
<p>&quot;But it doesn't do any good to fret about what might have been. It is a waste of energy. You have to concentrate on your present circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>When Hill joined Arrows, a perennial mid-grid team which struggled for a competitive budget before being bought by the forceful and ambitious Briton Tom Walkinshaw a year ago, he said he felt he could win races this year.</p>
<p>The combination of Walkinshaw's drive, a newly-designed car, with improved Yamaha engines and potentially-good Bridgestone tyres, appeared to back up his initial optimism. But pre-season testing has been a disappointment with engine and gearbox problems and a lack of speed.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to establish a level of competitiveness and there is the potential to improve more than any other car, as I have said. So, to qualify in the top 10 in Australia will be a tremendous achievement, if it is possible. But I am not going there to settle for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>&quot;I am driving now for a man, in Tom Walkinshaw, who has made all the right steps to build a top team for the future and my desire to succeed is stronger than ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Hill said he will go into 1997 feeling less pressure than ever before, despite all the problems at Arrows as he and the team fight to develop their performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't confuse pressure with a desire to succeed,&quot; he said. &quot;Winning a championship changes the pressure that you put yourself under. It is satisfying. But it fuels my desire to do it again.&quot;</p>
<p>With one title under his belt, after claiming 21 wins in only 67 Grands Prix, it is no suprise to hear Hill talk about aiming to return to the front end of the grid as quickly as possible. His problem, however, is that will require Arrows to progress faster this year in development and competitive performance than seems likely, or reasonably possible.</p>
