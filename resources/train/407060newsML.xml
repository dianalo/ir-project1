<title>ALBANIA: Albania students fear crackdown on protest.</title>
<headline>Albania students fear crackdown on protest.</headline>
<dateline>GJIROKASTER, Albania 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Special police units surrounded a university building occupied by students in the southern Albanian town of Gjirokaster on Thursday and threatened to intervene to halt a hunger strike, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Police ordered the students to leave the building on the grounds that the hunger strike was illegal, said one witness contacted by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;Police forces, plain-clothes policemen and maybe Democratic Party supporters are outside and are threatening to enter if students go on with the protest,&quot; he told Reuters from the town near the Greek border, 230 km (145 miles) south of Tirana.</p>
<p>Students had piled tables and chairs against doors and entrances to protect against a forced entry, he added.</p>
<p>President Sali Berisha's right-wing government has tried repeatedly to prevent peaceful protests by describing their actions as illegal. Many demonstrations have been crushed by force.</p>
<p>The Gjirokaster students, who were addressed by Berisha in the town on Wednesday, said they were unimpressed with his refusal to sack the government over its handling of a collapse of pyramid savings schemes.</p>
<p>Some 46 students started an anti-government hunger strike and a further 600 students occupied a nearby lecture hall.</p>
<p>They were acting in support of 45 students in the southern town of Vlore who entered the second week of their hunger strike in protest at the pyramid investment scheme scam.</p>
<p>Tirana students also attempted to start a hunger strike but reporters saw police preventing them from entering their university building.</p>
