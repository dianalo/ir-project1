<p>An Italian military helicopter involved in an evacuation mission from Albania was hit by small arms fire in the capital Tirana on Friday but there were no injuries, the defence ministry said.</p>
<p>A ministry statement said the AB-212, one of four helicopters acting as armed escort for two giant Chinooks, had been pierced by bullets.</p>
<p>&quot;It was hit by small arms fire which entered the cockpit without any consequences for the crew,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It was the first report of damage from small arms to helicopters involved in efforts by Italy and the United States to evacuate foreigners from the armed chaos spreading through Albania.</p>
<p>The statement did not make clear whether gunmen had aimed at the helicopter or it had been hit by random fire. Shooting in the air has become a trademark of the seemingly uncontrolled uprising in Albania.</p>
<p>The helicopter was involved in an early morning mission that brought in fresh military guards for the Italian and British embassies and brought out 93 people from Tirana in an airlift from the city's main soccer stadium.</p>
<p>The statement said the 93 included 52 Italians and 13 Russians.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday Italy's armed forces evacuated some 500 people, including some 120 British nationals, on helicopters from the port of Durres.</p>
<p>They were flown to the Italian warship San Giusto and were to be taken to the southern port of Brindisi later on Friday.</p>
<p>Another 400 people were evacuated to Italian navy ships in the Adriatic on Thursday.</p>
