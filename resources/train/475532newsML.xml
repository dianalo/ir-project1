<p>Two-time champion Betsy King shot a five-under par 67 on Saturday to move into a tie with Kelly Robbins entering the final round of the Nabisco Dinah Shore golf tournament.</p>
<p>Robbins, seeking her first win in the Dinah Shore, shot a 68.</p>
<p>Through 54 holes, both King and Robbins are at 11-under par 205. Amy Fruhwirth, a non-winner on the LPGA, shot a 68 and is two shots back.</p>
<p>King, who won here in 1987 and 1990, has not won since the ShopRite LPGA Classic in 1995 and is coming off one of her worst seasons.</p>
<p>&quot;It is so good to see Betsy playing well,&quot; Robbins said. &quot;She struggled for awhile. She's such a great player. I haven't seen her hit the ball that well in a long time. It's neat for Betsy and good for the game to see her back.&quot;</p>
<p>King has not had a bogey since the last hole of her first round, a string that reached 36 holes on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very happy with the way I played,&quot; she said. &quot;I drove it very well. I didn't miss a fairway and that's a key out here.&quot;</p>
<p>Robbins' round was more erratic. She mixed two bogeys in with four birdies and an eagle. The latter came at the par-5 11th hole, where she reached the green with a 5-wood second shot, then holed a 12-foot putt.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just trying to hang in there,&quot; she said. &quot;It seems like every day I walk off the golf course with a headache. There are no holes you can relax on.&quot;</p>
<p>Fruhwirth is seeking her first professional victory.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very proud of myself,&quot; she said. &quot;I kept my composure. I felt pretty good. I was calm. I couldn't ask for anything more, except maybe winning.&quot;</p>
