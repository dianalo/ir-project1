<headline>Argentine bolsa seen stable and calm due holiday.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-06-06</dateline>

<p>Argentine stocks were expected to open stable Friday in a very dull market due to a national holiday Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will be very calm today ahead of the holiday,&quot; said Augusto Milou, of Galicia Valores brokers. &quot;Major dealers will remain at the sidelines until Tuesday.&quot;  </p>
<p>Dealers said the market was in the middle of a downward correction after reaching recently its highest levels in five years. But the correction will be shortlived as the economy's fundamentals are strong.</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying trend is bullish,&quot; a local bank dealer said. &quot;After this correction the market may be testing new highs in the near future.&quot;</p>
<p>Expectations of a growing GDP add to positive corporate announcements like good Q4 earnings reported Thursday by steelmaker Siderca. Also, a consortium led by a controlled firm of holding Comercial del Plata Friday won a contract to operate an oil field in Venezuela.</p>
