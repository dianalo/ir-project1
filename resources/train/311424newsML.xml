<p>Some of the 300,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees still in eastern Zaire are returning home, malnourished and exhausted after a three-month odyssey, at the rate of 2,000 a day, relief agencies say.</p>
<p>&quot;Today 2,030 crossed the border compared with 2,006 on Tuesday,&quot; Judith Melby of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said a total of 11,000 of the refugees had returned since January 6 when a large group seeking repatriation first assembled near Bukavu in Zaire to cross into southwest Rwanda at Cyangugu.</p>
<p>The refugees are a fraction of an estimated 300,000 Rwandan Hutus still dotted around eastern Zaire, some in rebel-held areas and others in territory still controlled by President Mobutu Sese Seko's ragged army, the FAZ.</p>
<p>They have lived a long nightmare since Laurent Kabila's rebellion in the east was launched in mid-October.</p>
<p>Fleeing their U.N. camps because of the fighting, they moved westwards deeper into Zaire during the period when the UNHCR reckons about 700,000 other Rwandan Hutu refugees marched back into Rwanda in November.</p>
<p>All the Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire, who numbered 1.1 million before the rebellion according to UNHCR figures, fled their homeland in 1994 after the victory of mainly minority Tutsi rebels in the civil war.</p>
<p>Their military and civilian leaders, and many of the ordinary refugees, had committed the genocide earlier in 1994 in which about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered.</p>
<p>For more than two years the refugees refused to go home, fearing reprisals for the genocide by the new government.</p>
<p>Rwandan and foreign human rights workers agree that less than one percent of the returnees -- who number more than one million Hutus in total after Tanzania forced out 400,000 in December -- have been arrested on suspicion of genocide crimes.</p>
<p>The remaining refugees in eastern Zaire became an international political football in November and December. France led the pressure for an international military intervention to help them but the plan came to nothing, partly because countries including the United States and Rwanda denied that as many as 300,000 were still in Zaire.</p>
<p>Thousands of the refugees will persist in choosing misery in Zaire instead of a return to Rwanda because they expect to be arrested for genocide crimes.</p>
<p>Rwanda's prisons are already crammed with 90,000 Hutu suspects and the first trials, with the death penalty for the most guilty, have begun.</p>
<p>The UNHCR and other relief agencies estimate thousands more refugees are ready to follow the 10,000 who have crossed voluntarily at Cyangugu since January 6.</p>
<p>Melby said 10,000 were gathered at Bunyakiri and Kingulube, west of Bukavu, and cited reports that about 27,000 at government-held Shabunda, further west, were also willing to come home.</p>
<p>The harsh conditions they have endured in the past three months and the moderate treatment prior returnees have received in Rwanda, have apparently caused the change of heart.</p>
<p>But after weeks of marching and camping in eastern Zaire they have to run the gauntlet to reach Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;They have to cross the FAZ front-line, then the rebel front line and finally the forest before they get to Bukavu,&quot; Melby said.</p>
