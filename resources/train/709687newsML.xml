<p>CSCE world sugar futures closed weaker and under support amid local selling and a lack of buying interest, market sources said.</p>
<p>The bulk of the day's activity, estimated at a thin 8,762 lots, took place early in the day and then late in the session, when the locals pressured the benchmark October contract to the day's low of 11.06 cents.</p>
<p>Dealers expect follow-through selling on Tuesday to pressure the October contract towards its next downside target at 11.00-10.96 cents. But trade buying could hold the contract over that key area, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;If it breaks 11.00 cents we'll snap back like we did on Thursday (when the contract fell to a low of 10.90 cents),&quot; Tony Passimenti, a sugar broker with Merrill Lynch said. &quot;There seems to be trade interest underneath.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark October contract ended 0.12 cent lower at 11.06 cents per lb, having ranged from 11.20 cents to 11.06 cents. The rest of the board finished 0.02 to 0.10 cent weaker.</p>
<p>Technical resistance was pegged at Thursday's high of 11.22 cents basis the October contract followed by 11.40 cents, the high reached 11.40 cents.</p>
<p>Open interest in October fell by 1,158 lots to 94,278 lots as of Thursday. March fell 354 lots to 42,029 lots.</p>
<p>The market is not expected to break out of its broader trading range between 10.80 cents and 11.50 cents without any inspiration from the fundamental side.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is searching for a new level but without any physical offtake, not much may happen,&quot; Passimenti said.</p>
