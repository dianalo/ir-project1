<headline>FORECAST - U.S. Oct personal income seen steady.</headline>

<p>A shorter workweek and leveling off in wage and salary growth suggests personal income remained relatively steady in October, experts said.</p>
<p>Slightly weaker automobile purchases offset by gains in spending for other consumer goods and services point to a modest pick-up in personal consumption in October, they said.</p>
<p>Personal income and consumption data are due out at 0830 EST/1330 GMT on Friday, November 29. Economists polled by Reuters, on average, expected income to be unchanged in October, while consumption is seen rising 0.3 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The best way to look at personal income is to look at the hours data for the month,&quot; said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc.</p>
<p>Kretzmer referred to the index of aggregate weekly hours from October's employment report. &quot;The hours data were quite weak in October, down close to a percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>That is why most economists expect personal income to be either unchanged or to decline in October, Kretzmer added.</p>
<p>The total index of aggregate weekly hours fell to 136.8 in October from 138.1 in September. Experts also looked at hourly earnings and non-farm payrolls to help gauge personal income.  </p>
<p> HSBC Markets senior economist Christopher Low predicted October personal income rose 0.2 percent, higher than the average forecast but below the 0.6 percent gain in September.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason we're seeing slower income growth this month than (in) the last couple of months is that we have seen a slowdown in wages and salary growth,&quot; Low said.</p>
<p>Hourly earnings climbed from $11.87 in August to $11.91 in September but remained at that level in October.</p>
<p>Another reason why income growth slowed in October was because non-farm payrolls did not rebound strongly that month, according to Low.  </p>
<p>October non-farm payrolls increased 210,000 after tumbling 35,000 in September.</p>
<p>&quot;We did have an increase but it wasn't that big considering the decline the month before,&quot; Low said.</p>
<p>As for personal consumption, analysts looked partly to October retail sales for clues about consumer spending. Sales rose a modest 0.2 percent in October.</p>
<p>Low said October retail sales suggested a very moderate rise in consumer spending.  </p>
<p>NationsBanc Capital Markets' Kretzmer contended the October personal consumption gain will consist of a small decline in unit vehicle sales offset by a moderate bounceback both in retail sales excluding autos and in spending for services.</p>
<p>The consensus forecasts calling for October personal income to be unchanged and consumption to rise 0.3 percent contrasts with September's 0.6 percent gain in income and 0.1 percent increase in consumption.</p>
<p>Yet Tokai Bank Ltd chief economist Tim McGee played down the difference in the two months.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're...really looking at some monthly flip-flops in the data,&quot; McGee said. &quot;So, I wouldn't make too much of the one month pattern because I think it's just averaging out what happened in the previous month and keeping things pretty much on trend.&quot;</p>
