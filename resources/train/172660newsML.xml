<p>Wine, packaging and appliance manufacturing group Southcorp Holdings Ltd said on Friday it expected to meet analysts' forecasts for a net profit of over A$130 million for the 1996/97 (July-June) financial year.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the analysts' forecasts, they have all got us in the mid-130s (million) or thereabouts, somewhere in the 130s,&quot; chief executive Graham Kraehe told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are comfortable with that sort of forecast and we expect to be meeting that sort of forecast,&quot; he said. Southcorp reported a net profit of A$124.22 million in 1995/96.  </p>
<p>Asked whether Southcorp currently was ahead of last year, Kraehe said: &quot;Our plan is to be pretty well ahead of last year and we are comfortable with where we are at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Kraehe said the company's United States water heater business was continuing to improve.</p>
<p>&quot;We are obviously not happy with its absolute position but we are very happy with where it is compared to where it was 12 and 18 months ago,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Kraehe said a decision to invest A$35 million over three years at Southcorp Wines wineries in the Barossa Valley and Victoria would progressively increase capacity by 86 percent and give flexibility for alternative packaging configuration.</p>
<p>Investment in storage and bottling followed Southcorp's significant investment in vineyards over recent years, driven by 15-20 percent growth in volume for several years which was expected to continue through the turn of the century, he said.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Southcorp's objective was an international wine acquisition, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We really have got all the organic growth in place we think, and we are looking for something international which will further boost our global position in premium wine,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it needs to be right,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The geographical target in terms of the market we are really aiming at is predominantly but not exclusively north America, (but) that does not mean to say the operations need to be in north America necessarily,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Europe and Australia were not priorities, any of the so-called New World wine countries were possible, he said.  </p>
<p>The New World wine producers include California, South Africa, Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>Kraehe said Southcorp's wine exports continued to be very strong, and allocation of premium red wines, given the international shortage, was a big issue in all markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news there is off the 1996 vintage we effectively doubled the red wine availability of what we have had in the last four or five years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Southcorp shares were three cents firmer at A$3.80 at 11.20 a.m. (0020 GMT).  -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
