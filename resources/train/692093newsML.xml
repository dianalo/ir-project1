<p>Repairs to the Mir space station may mean the two Russian cosmonauts entering its damaged module in space suits and leaving American Michael Foale in the station's escape capsule for safety, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Deputy mission chief Sergei Krikalyov told the crew from Mission Control near Moscow: &quot;Guys, it seems you will have to make a sortie to the Spektr module...And you, Mike, if this happens, will have to sit in the escape capsule.&quot; Reporters heard one of the Russians reply: &quot;It's very problematic&quot;  </p>
<p>Krikalyov said it was very important to have commander Vasily Tsibliyev and flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin's assessment of the possibility of repairing Mir's crippled electric power system. Foale's bosses at NASA have offered supplies but the Russians have said they can manage alone.</p>
<p>In about 10 days' time, an unmanned cargo craft will deliver a &quot;hermoplate&quot; -- a device enabling the cosmonauts to pass through an airlock into the Spektr -- as well as special equipment to adapt their space suits to the existence of tiny quantities of air still in the holed module.</p>
<p>Yuri Semyonov, president of Russia's Energiya space manufacturing company, told reporters at mission control: &quot;The cosmonauts are experiencing emotional and physical stress and so we plan for them to take a rest on Saturday and Sunday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are facing two tasks -- to secure safety of the cosmonauts and to carry out repair works to bring the flight system back to life,&quot; Semyonov said. &quot;We are not going to abort Mir's mission.&quot;</p>
