<p>Yugoslavia's ruling coalition declared that voters had renewed its mandate to &quot;follow the road of progress and development&quot; by their emphatic support in federal elections, state news agency Tanjug reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier, the federal election commission announced that the coalition of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had won a clear victory in Sunday's poll, winning 64 seats in the 138-seat parliament.</p>
<p>Ivica Dacic, spokesman for the ruling coalition comprising Milosevic's Socialist Party (SPS), the Yugoslav United Left (JUL) led by his wife Mirjana, and New Democracy, called the victory &quot;great and convincing&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;(Voters) supported those who proved to be fighting for the interests of their country and its citizens, and who work to create a modern, democratic and economically free, spiritually wealthy and socially just society,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dacic added that the coalition increased its majority by 17 extra seats, from 47 in the old parliament elected in 1992.</p>
<p>A commission spokesman told reporters the opposition Zajedno coalition took 22 seats, the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro had 20 and the Radical Party won 16 seats.</p>
<p>The remaining seats were shared among the Montenegrin National Party (8), the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (3), the Vojvodina coalition (2), while the (Moslem) list for Sandzak, the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro and the Moslem Party of Democratic Action each gained one seat.</p>
<p>Voters across Yugoslavia, now made up of Serbia and Montenegro, voted for a new federal parliament, a republican assembly for Montenegro and local councils across the federation.</p>
<p>In a vigorous campaign supported by the state-owned media, Milosevic succeeded in wiping out the bitter memories of the death and deprivation from a four-year Balkan war he is widely blamed for helping set in motion.</p>
<p>Vojislav Kostunica, who leads Zajedno's main Democratic Party, blamed its poor performance on &quot;media violence&quot; towards his coalition, and electoral rigging.</p>
<p>&quot;Many young people were taken off the electoral lists and non-existing dead souls were added,&quot; he told the independent news agency Fonet.</p>
<p>Fonet also said he accused state-controlled television of granting Zajedno only three minutes of programme time in the last week of the campaign, compared to 100 given to the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>The national television network, tightly controlled by the rulling parties, is the most important medium in a country where most people are too poor to buy newspapers.</p>
<p>The clear-cut victory will enable Milosevic to consolidate his power ahead of elections in Serbia next spring, analysts say.</p>
<p>His coalition was 26 seats short of the two-thirds majority he needs to alter the Yugoslav constitution to enable him to retain power when his second and final term as Serbian president expires next year.</p>
<p>But the coalition can expect enough support in parliament from the DPS and ethnic Hungarian parties to push through the changes, analysts added.</p>
<p>Diplomats expect Milosevic to move next year into the post of Yugoslav president, which would be vested with sweeping executive powers.</p>
