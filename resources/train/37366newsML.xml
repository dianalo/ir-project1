<p>Two Marine Corps CH-46E helicopters supporting the entourage of U.S. President Bill Clinton were involved in separate incidents on Friday, one rolling over and burning at a local airport and the other landing in a nearby field after a warning light went on.</p>
<p>There were no injuries and Clinton, on a two-day campaign trip to Florida, was not involved in either incident, defence officials said in Washington.</p>
<p>Marine Corps officials at the Pentagon said the incidents, which followed the crash of a presidential travel support plane last month, occurred only a short time apart but were not connected.</p>
<p>A C-130 Air Force cargo plane that accompanied Clinton on his vacation trip to Jackson, Wyoming, crashed on a Wyoming mountain on Aug. 17, killing all nine people aboard. Eight were crew members and one was a Secret Service agent.</p>
<p>One of the big twin-bladed CH-46E &quot;Sea Knight&quot; cargo helicopters was taxiing on a runway at Orlando Executive Airport when it rolled over and burned for unknown reasons. All the four or five crew members escaped safely, White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>That helicopter had been used on Thursday to transport members of the presidential party but not Clinton, who was elsewhere in Orlando when the incident occurred.</p>
<p>Marine Corps officials said a second CH-64E helicopter also landed safely in a field about 12 miles (20 km) south of Orlando after a warning light indicated an engine problem. None of the crew members was injured, officials said.</p>
<p>The helicopters are attached to Squadron HMX-1 based in Quantico, Virginia, near Washington. The squadron provides helicopters for White House use and support.</p>
<p>The CH-46 was first used in the Vietnam War and is designed to carry troops or up to 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) of cargo.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps officials said the incidents were under investigation.</p>
