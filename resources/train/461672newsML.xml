<p>Moslem guerrillas hacked to death 32 villagers, including 16 women and a 14-year-old boy, in a massacre in northeastern Algeria, an Algerian newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>About 30 Moslem rebels, armed with knives, hatchets and shotguns, stormed Ouled Antar village in the province of Medea, 70 km (45 miles) southwest of Algiers, on Wednesday, said El Watan newspaper.</p>
<p>Those killed were members of four families, it said, adding that the attackers ignored pleas for mercy and slaughtered the 32 before burying them.</p>
<p>El Watan said the assailants'leader ordered which of the villagers should be killed.</p>
<p>The reported killings were the latest in a series of massacres of villagers the authorities blame on Moslem guerrillas.</p>
<p>The guerrillas slaughtered 33 people in Kerrach village, in Blida province, 50 km (30 miles) south of Algiers, on February 16.</p>
<p>More than 300 people have been killed in massacres and bomb attacks between  January and February this year, according to Algerian reports.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people had died in Algeria since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
