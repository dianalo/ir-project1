<p>A U.S. mediator planned to hold more talks on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>&quot;Dennis Ross will see the prime minister in his office tomorrow (Monday) morning and will travel to Arafat afterwards,&quot; Netanyahu's spokesman said in a statement late on Sunday.</p>
<p>Netanyahu and Arafat met secretly under the cover of darkness early on Sunday but failed to break the deadlock on a self-rule deal for Hebron.</p>
<p>After the four-hour meeting on the Israeli-Gaza border, Ross and U.S. officials held talks in Jerusalem with the Israeli negotiating team, but there was no sign an agreement was near.</p>
<p>An accord would give Palestinians self-rule in most of Hebron, a volatile town of 100,000 Arabs and 400 Jews. Security issues and other concerns over the last 10 months have delayed the Israeli handover to Arafat's PLO.</p>
<p>&quot;The teams have concluded their work for this (Sunday) evening and let us hope that that is all, with God's help,&quot; Netanyahu spokesman Shai Bazak said in the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;No meeting is expected this evening between the prime minister and Ross or with Arafat,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Netanyahu confirmed in a speech to business executives in Tel Aviv that he had met Arafat secretly in a bid to hammer out a deal away from the media spotlight.</p>
<p>&quot;I met with Yasser Arafat at the Erez junction,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;We are making progress but we still haven't reached full agreement on all the issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinians say the central issue blocking an accord is Israel's refusal to commit to a timetable for three further West Bank pullbacks in mostly rural areas after Hebron, as stipulated in previous peace deals.</p>
<p>Chief PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat said that, despite the snags, a deal would be signed on Monday in the West Bank town of Jericho to station 210 international observers in Hebron once Israeli troops redeploy.</p>
<p>He said the observers would come from Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.</p>
<p>Under a 1995 interim agreement, international observers are to be deployed in the town to maintain order, protect residents and monitor violations of the agreement.</p>
<p>Some 400 Palestinian policemen are due to deploy in the Palestinian-ruled part of Hebron.</p>
<p>Officials for the two sides, who last week predicted an imminent deal, accused each other of causing a delay.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Arafat isn't ready to close the deal on the basis of the agreements that have already been made,&quot; Netanyahu's adviser Dore Gold told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There won't be an agreement unless there will be a commitment on the three phases,&quot; Arafat's adviser Ahmed Tibi told Israeli army radio. Erekat said other issues also had to be resolved.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the West Bank, Jewish settlers on Sunday removed mobile homes they had planted on a West Bank hilltop in defiance of the Israeli government.</p>
<p>In return for their decision to dismantle the makeshift outpost set up on Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai met with settler leaders in the nearby settlement of Beit El to discuss their demands to expand the community.</p>
<p>Yoel Tsur, a Beit El resident whose wife and son were killed by Palestinian gunmen last month, said Mordechai had promised an answer &quot;tomorrow or in two days&quot; on the question of expanding the settlement.</p>
