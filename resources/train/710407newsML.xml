<p>Hong Kong's economy still looks bright after the territory's handover to China, but its political future is less reassuring, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Economically, Hong Kong looks pretty good but socially, I have a lot of questions,&quot; John Frankenstein of Copenhagen Business School said at a panel discussion at Hong Kong Baptist University.</p>
<p>Britain returned Hong Kong to China on July 1, ending more than 150 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>Frankenstein said Hong Kong people will need to work out uncertainties pertaining to the operation of a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; framework.</p>
<p>&quot;People must think about how the Bill of Rights mingles with other laws. In other countries, the Bill of Rights is supreme, but in Chinese law, the Bill of Rights is just another set of laws,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ken Davies of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said he was optimistic about Hong Kong's growth prospects in the next five years.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong will grow slightly faster or at least as fast as it has been growing,&quot; he said. The territory grew at a 5.5 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>But Davies predicted Hong Kong would lose ground in the EIU's business environment ranking, partly because other countries are doing better and partly because of growing political uncertainty in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;We see Hong Kong at 8.15 in the 1997-2001 period, down from 8.69 now,&quot; said Davies.</p>
<p>That would put Hong Kong in 13th place among the 58 countries, a big drop from its top position now.</p>
<p>Hong Kong will keep high marks for its foreign trade and macroeconomic environments, but its political environment ranking is seen dropping to 37 from 18.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong is likely to be involved in China's trade disputes and disputes over contested islands,&quot; said Davies.</p>
<p>&quot;The rule of law may well be challenged in a way that will not make life easier for foreign investors, and there also is a fear that corruption may rise,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Baptist University's Michael DeGolyer said Hong Kong's future will be tied more to mainland developments.</p>
<p>&quot;The sovereignty and economic shift to China means stronger reliance on China's stability or instability and its fundamental economic, international and political directions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Conflict between the political and social cultures of Hong Kong and China also will drive the relationship.</p>
<p>Jamie Allen, who published a book analysing the buying up of key Hong Kong companies by mainland entities, said Hong Kong also will influence China.</p>
<p>But predictions that China would become more democratic because of its ties with Hong Kong are exaggerated, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact of the idea of democracy in China over the next five years will be muted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rather than clamoring for more democracy, China's people are more likely to covet other Hong Kong characteristics, such as low tax rates, he said.</p>
<p>The panelists were mixed on possibility of a more widespread infiltration by China's communist party into Hong Kong, but none believed the party could make significant strides in open votes.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to accept that the communist party is here, but how will it exert itself?&quot; asked Frankenstein. &quot;If it comes out into the open, it will have to compete with other parties and lose in elections. And that would not be a very attractive proposition.&quot;</p>
