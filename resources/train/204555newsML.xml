<p>Southeast Asian nations are determined to bring Vietnam into APEC as soon as possible, possibly as early as this week, a senior Philippines official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Severino, under-secretary at the Philippines Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said officials of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum would discuss expanding membership at a meeting on Thursday, ahead of the 18-nation grouping's summit in Manila next week.</p>
<p>He said the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had agreed to argue for Vietnamese membership at that meeting and at a subsequent meeting of ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;With regards to Vietnam, ASEAN is committed to the early entry of Vietnam into APEC,&quot; Severino said.</p>
<p>&quot;We want it as soon as possible -- no date would be soon enough,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;This week would be fine.&quot;</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Severino was echoing comments of the Philippines' former trade minister Rizalino Navarro, who said last week that Vietnam could join APEC during the Manila summit.</p>
<p>Asked if he thought this were possible, Severino said that decision could only be made by senior officials and their ministers.</p>
<p>Vietnam is the only member of ASEAN not currently part of APEC, which aims to create a giant free trade area stretching from Washington to Jakarta and from Sydney to Beijing by 2020.</p>
<p>Severino said APEC officials had agreed that new members would have to meet three criteria: geographic proximity, an ability to integrate economically into APEC and a commitment to the goals of the grouping.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said this month that a number of countries had applied to join APEC, now that a three-year moratorium on new members was expiring.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say a majority (of APEC members) are not in favour of extending the moratorium,&quot; Severino said. &quot;The door is open.&quot;</p>
<p>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.</p>
<p>The Philippines is the current APEC chair holder.</p>
