<p>* The National Statistics Office said Philippine October inflation was at 4.7 pct vs September level of 4.4 pct  </p>
<p>* The BusinessWorld says business groups were mildly surprosed by the lower-than-expected October inflation rate. The paper said the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) and the Federation of Philippine Industires said the 4.7 percent rate only proved there is no reason for a mandated wage hike.</p>
<p>* The Business Daily quoting Central Bank Treasury Director Sergio Edeza said that overnight lending rates were raised on Tuesday from 13 percent to 15 percent to quell speculative attacks against the peso.</p>
<p>* Petron and the National Power Corp signed a 16 billion peso fuel supply contract with Petron providing the power firm 2.2 billion liters of fuel oil and diesel in the next two years.</p>
