<p>Sunbeam Corp, the struggling appliance maker that recently underwent a massive restructuring, said Tuesday it has signed six new international distributor agreements and rolled out 42 new 220 volt appliances in 10 international regions.</p>
<p>The company also said it had opened four new outlet stores in the past two months. It expects to open 20 outlet stores during 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;New product development and expansion into new markets are key to the rescue plan of the corporation and for igniting Sunbeam's growth,&quot; Chairman and Chief Executive Al Dunlap said.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, only about 15 percent of our total sales are generated outside the United States,&quot; Dunlap added. &quot;Our goal is to more than triple our international sales in the next three years through the continued rapid implementation of all our various growth initiatives.&quot;</p>
<p>The distributor agreements cover the Philippines, South Africa, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Chile. The value of the agreements was not disclosed.</p>
<p>The moves come several months after Sunbeam announced it would cut 6,000 jobs, or about half of its work force, and eliminate 87 percent of its product lines.</p>
<p>The measures were taken in November, about four months after Dunlap became chairman -- and shortly after it reported a third quarter loss of $28.7 million, or $0.22 per share, as sales fell about 2 percent to $244.9 million.</p>
