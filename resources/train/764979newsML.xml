<p>Cigarette companies cannot argue in an upcoming trial that Florida contributed to tobacco-related illness by failing to vigorously enforce laws against the sale of cigarettes to minors, a judge ruled Wednesday.</p>
<p>The tobacco companies had hoped to show evidence that Florida was partly to blame for such illnesses because it enforced laws barring gambling and alcohol consumption by minors but did little or nothing to halt the sale of cigarettes to children.</p>
<p>Circuit Judge Harold Cohen said the evidence could not be introduced in Florida's lawsuit seeking to recover $1 billion of Medicaid money spent treating smoking-related illness. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Friday in the trial.</p>
<p>Also Wednesday, Cohen again rejected the tobacco companies' attempt to introduce evidence that the state shared blame because it formerly made and distributed cigarettes in its prisons.</p>
<p>The judge said the information could not be used during the trial but could be considered in assessing damages if the tobacco companies are found guilty of misleading the public about the health risks of smoking.</p>
<p>Cohen said it was not necessary for the jury to hear the information in determining guilt because the state has already agreed to reduce any damage award by the amount of revenue received from its cigarette operations. The reduction would be based on the top revenue year between 1972 and 1978, when Florida got out of the cigarette manufacturing business.</p>
<p>W.C. Gentry, one of the attorneys for the state, said he was extremely pleased by the rulings.</p>
<p>&quot;This will cut at least one week out of the trial. It will keep the jury's attention focused on the real issues of the case,&quot; Gentry said.</p>
<p>Gentry argued during the hearing that the tobaco industry had known since 1959 that the additive benzo-a-pyrene caused lung cancer but never informed the public of that risk.</p>
<p>&quot;Up to this very day that additive is still being used in cigarettes and the companies still have not notified the public of the risk,&quot; he said outside the courtroom.</p>
<p>Justice Reid, an attorney for the Lorillard Tobacco Co., a unit of Loews Corp. , said, &quot;I am not shocked by the court's acceptance of the state's weak arguments on these two issues.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the tobacco company attorneys would need time to assess how the rulings will affect their case. ((--Miami Bureau, 305-374-5013))</p>
