<p>The bodies of an American couple, missing since October 24, were dug out from under eight feet of snow in the western part of the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal on Sunday, rescuers said.</p>
<p>The rescuers, mainly Nepali sherpas and porters, found the bodies of Philip Jack Fialkow, 62, dean of a medical school in Washington State and his wife Helen Costas Fialkow, 61, as well as three Nepali staff.</p>
<p>Rescuers believe they died while trekking in the Upper Dolopo area, more than 250 km (156 miles) west of Nepal's capital Kathmandu.</p>
<p>The couple and their staff were on their way to Tse Gomba, a popular Buddhist monastery in west Nepal, said Kishendra Shahi, pilot of the helicopter which retrieved the couple's remains.</p>
<p>They were trapped in heavy snow near the Langmosin pass, about 4,267 metres (14,000 feet) high on their way to the monastery.</p>
<p>Some parts of Nepal witness heavy blizzards in November and December which often bury trekkers.</p>
<p>In November last year, a blizzard in Nepal killed 63 people including two dozen foreign trekkers.</p>
