<p>Prime Minister Jean Chretien said on Monday an Asian trade visit had boosted the Canadian economy with the signing of over C$2.1 billion ($1.57 billion) in deals, and also helped foster national unity.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concluding a very successful trip,&quot; Chretien told a news conference on the last day of a 12-day tour of South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand.</p>
<p>Chretien was joined by nine of Canada's 10 provincial premiers and about 400 businessmen on the third &quot;Team Canada&quot; trade mission to Asia.</p>
<p>He said business deals amounting to about C$2.13 billion were signed by the government and businessmen on the trip -- C$874 million of which was in firm contracts and the rest in memoranda of understanding.</p>
<p>Chretien said an important aspect of the mission was that it helped small and medium-sized businesses get better international exposure.</p>
<p>&quot;Only eight percent of our small and medium-sized businesses do international trade,&quot; he said, comparing Canada with Germany where he said 48 percent of small and medium-sized companies were involved in foreign trade.</p>
<p>Chretien said the trip helped forge closer ties between federal politicians and provincial premiers.</p>
<p>Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard was on the trade mission with the other premiers, marking the first time the separatist Parti Quebecois government joined other Canadian provincial premiers on such a trip.</p>
<p>Bouchard's predecessor as premier, Jacques Parizeau, refused to participate in similar federal government-led trade missions to Asia in 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;For us it was a good visit with the premiers. Mr Bouchard was extremely civilised. Of course the programme of his party is still the programme of his party. And the programme of my party is very clear...and I am a federalist,&quot; Chretien said.</p>
<p>Chretien, a native Quebecker, fiercely opposes the idea of a sovereign Quebec.</p>
<p>&quot;This was good for the Canadian people to realise that all the premiers could travel together, and pull in the same direction for the good of Canadians and creation of jobs in Canada.&quot;</p>
<p>Bouchard became Quebec premier last January and has vowed to make the mainly French-speaking province independent.</p>
<p>The separatists lost an October 1995 referendum on Quebec sovereignty by a narrow margin. Under Quebec law the Parti Quebecois must win another provincial election before it can hold another referendum on sovereignty.</p>
