<p>The chairman of Lithuania's parliament and presidential candidate Vytautas Landsbergis said on Monday that his country wants to be invited to join NATO together with Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no arguments why a dividing line should be drawn for a few years between Lithuania and Poland,&quot; Landsbergis told a news conference.</p>
<p>Poland is expected to be invited to join NATO along with Hungary and the Czech Republic during a summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>Diplomats have all but written Lithuania and Baltic cousins Latvia and Estonia out of the first round of NATO expansion on the grounds that their inclusion would be regarded as a provocation by Moscow.</p>
<p>Landsbergis said that Lithuania was as qualified to join NATO as Poland and said that the West was having a difficult time explaining why Lithuania should be left out of the alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;Evaluating the two countries according to the same criteria makes it difficult for Western politicians to answer why both countries will not be accepted together,&quot; Landsbergis said.</p>
<p>Landsbergis also said that the main aim of Lithuania is to be invited to join NATO with or without a particular date.</p>
<p>&quot;We want it to be voiced that Lithuania will become a member of NATO,&quot; he said.</p>
