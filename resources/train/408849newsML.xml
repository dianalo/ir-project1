<title>UK: Fergie moves into Andy's servants' quarters.</title>
<headline>Fergie moves into Andy's servants' quarters.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Duchess of York has moved back to the home of her ex-husband Prince Andrew, less than a year after the couple divorced, British tabloid newspapers reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the Duchess, popularly known as Fergie, will not be living with Andrew. Instead she and her two young daughters will occupy servants' quarters at the huge Sunninghill estate she and Andrew had built as their marital home after they wed in 1986.</p>
<p>Despite their divorce, she and Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, have remained close friends.</p>
<p>They recently went on a skiing together with their daughters and they appear very happy in one another's company, laughing and embracing when they meet.</p>
<p>Fergie has described Andrew as her &quot;bestest friend.&quot;</p>
<p>The tabloids quoted friends of Fergie's as saying she was moving back to Sunninghill to save money.</p>
<p>The Duchess is reported to have paid back bank debts, said to amount to millions of pounds (dollars) by taking part in advertisements and promotions in the United States and selling an autobiography of her life inside the royal family.</p>
<p>But she still owes large sums in tax, according to media reports. Her return to the marital home will save her the 6,000 pounds ($9,821) a month she was paying to rent a six-bedroom mansion in Surrey, southern England, the tabloids said.</p>
