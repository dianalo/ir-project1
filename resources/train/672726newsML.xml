<p>Forest sector stocks kicked the New Zealand share market off to a strong start on thin turnover while the broader market was flat, brokers said.</p>
<p>By 10.15 a.m. (2215 GMT) the NZSE-40 Capital Index was up 9.39 points at 2,416.89 on turnover worth NZ$12 million.</p>
<p>Forestry sector stocks Carter Holt Harvey, up five at NZ$3.60, Fletcher Paper, up five at $3.49 and Fletcher Forests, up 10 at $2.20, were leading the charge.</p>
<p>Telecom, having driven the market over the last few days, fell quiet and lost one cent to NZ$7.37.  </p>
<p>Murray Rutherford at brokers SBC Warburg said the forest sector was simply reflecting a general re-rating as inventory levels declined and pulp prices rose.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the gains have been in those forestry-related leaders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Outside the first tier issues, Newmarket Property Trust took a five cent dive to NZ$0.72 after an announcement on Thursday that its June year profit would be materially below its original forecast.  </p>
<p>The company forecast net profit after tax for the year to June 30 of NZ$1.857 million and $5.078 million for the June 1998 year.</p>
