<headline>Fourth person charged in Cosby extortion scheme.</headline>

<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>A man was arrested Friday in Los Angeles on charges he helped a woman try to extort $40 million from entertainer Bill Cosby by claiming she is his illegitimate daughter.</p>
<p>Boris Sabas, also known as Boris Shmulevich, 42, is the fourth person charged in the scheme. Sabas was indicted by a Manhattan federal grand jury Thursday, federal prosecutors said. He was arrested by FBI agents early Friday morning.</p>
<p>Autumn Jackson, 22, and her alleged accomplice Jose Medina, 51, were previously charged in a three-count indictment alleging they tried to obtain money from Cosby by threatening to reveal to a tabloid newpaper Jackson's claim that Cosby is her out-of-wedlock father.</p>
<p>They are charged with conspiracy, extortion and violating the federal law that prohibits people from engaging in interstate commerce to commit certain offences.</p>
<p>If convicted of all counts, they face a possible total prison term of 12 years and fines of $750,000. Jackson and Medina both pleaded not guilty Feb. 20 in Manhattan federal court.</p>
<p>In January, Jackson's boyfriend, Antonay Williams, 26, of Perry, Fla., pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count each of conspiracy and aiding and abetting an extortion.</p>
<p>Williams told the court he helped Jackson and Medina in their scheme by threatening to disclose to the media that Cosby was her father.</p>
<p>Cosby has admitted to having an affair with Jackson's mother but denied being her father. According to court papers, Jackson was one of many young people for whom Cosby paid educational expenses for several years.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors have said there was no evidence the scheme was connected to the murder of Cosby's son Ennis, killed Jan 16 by a gunman in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The indictment charges that Jackson and Medina tried to pressure Cosby into paying her by contacting Cosby's corporate sponsors and the CBS television network, which broadcasts his comedy series &quot;Cosby.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Jackson also had sent a letter to Cosby's lawyer Jan. 16 stating &quot;I need monies and I need monies now&quot; and that &quot;I don't want to do anything to harm my father in any way, if at all possible to avoid.&quot;</p>
<p>The indictment alleges she spoke to the lawyer Jan. 17 and demanded $40 million. She eventually agreed to refrain from publicising her claim in exchange for $24 million.</p>
<p>The two defendants flew to New York on the night of Jan. 17 and met with the lawyer the next morning. They were arrested after they signed an agreement stating they would not sell Jackson's story in exchange for $24 million.</p>
<p>Sabas is charged with assisting in the scheme by driving Jackson and Medina to the airport and made flight arrangements for them to return to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Jackson was released on bail, but Medina remains in custody.</p>
