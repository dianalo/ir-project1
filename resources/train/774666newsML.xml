<title>IRAN: Tehran Mayor defends arrested employees.</title>
<headline>Tehran Mayor defends arrested employees.</headline>

<p>The mayor of Tehran has attacked the arrest of four senior officials at his municipality for alleged financial corruption as politically motivated, a newspaper reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Gholamhossein Karbaschi said the arrest last month of his security chief and other officials was &quot;unjustified, politically motivated and unacceptable. I am ready to stand up and defend my employees.&quot;</p>
<p>His comments were carried by the English-language Iran News.</p>
<p>Iranian police seized four officials at Tehran municipality late in July, including the financial and administrative director, the security chief and the mayor of a Tehran suburb.</p>
<p>Iran News said 100 parliament deputies in Tehran had written to Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi denouncing the arrests.</p>
<p>Newspapers said the arrests followed calls by senior clerics and supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declaring &quot;war on financial corruption and illegally acquired fortunes&quot;.</p>
<p>Iranian leaders have called for tough action against corruption following a series of trials for embezzlement and fraud at state agencies and banks in recent years.</p>
<p>Iran News said the mayor was a supporter of new President Mohammad Khatami and has been accused by hardline conservatives defeated in May's elections of mismanagement of municipal authority.</p>
