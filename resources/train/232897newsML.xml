<p>South Korea on Tuesday proposed a revision of restrictive labour laws aimed at ending a decade of often violent industrial conflict and improving competitiveness of local companies.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung said in a statement broadcast on television that providing new labour laws designed to establish new labour-management relations was the &quot;task directly affecting the nation's destiny&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We stand at a crossroads leading to becoming a wealthier, prosperous nation or a nation without any hope falling behind others,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The proposal lifts the ban on trade unions' political activity and allows outside intervention in labour disputes, while removing restrictions barring workers from forming more than one union in each workplace from the year 2002.</p>
<p>Teachers will be permitted to organise a solidarity group for limited collective bargaining from 1999 but they would still be barred from going on strike. Public servants would not be allowed to form unions.</p>
<p>Economists said ending fierce confrontations between unions and management was crucial for improving South Korea's economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>The proposal also follows South Korea's recent invitation to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). South Korea's parliament has ratified the country's membership in the Paris-based club of industrialised nations.</p>
<p>The revision would allow companies to lay off employees to introduce new technology, improve productivity and end management difficulties.</p>
<p>Companies, however, must attempt to avoid layoffs and inform workers at least 60 days beforehand if a reduction in the number of employees becomes inevitable.</p>
<p>The revision also clarifies that workers can no longer claim wages during the period they are on strike. Many South Korean companies have so far paid wages to striking workers to help improve union-management relations.</p>
<p>A Labour Ministry spokesman said the government planned to send a labour reform bill to parliament later this month for approval.</p>
