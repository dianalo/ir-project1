<p>The Japanese government has decided to sack its ambassador to Peru following a four-month hostage drama at his residence in Lima, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda announced on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have heard yet again Ambassador Morihisa Aoki's desire to step down and after considering many things, we have decided to ask him to leave the post,&quot; Ikeda told a special parliamentary session on the Peru hostage crisis.</p>
<p>Aoki was the host of a reception at his residence on December 17 which was stormed by Peruvian Marxist rebels.</p>
<p>The crisis came to an end last month after a daring operation by Peruvian commandos. Two commandos and one hostage, as well as all 14 rebels, were killed in the raid which freed 71 hostages.</p>
<p>Aoki was at the centre of a controversy in Japan over lax security measures for the reception and for his behaviour during and after the crisis. In testimony to parliament on Tuesday, Aoki repeatedly apologised for his role in the affair and asked that he be relieved of his post.</p>
