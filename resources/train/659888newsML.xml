<title>FRANCE: French stocks end at new record closing high.</title>
<headline>French stocks end at new record closing high.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-06-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Friday the 13th proved lucky for the Paris bourse, which surged 1.75 percent to close at a all-time closing high of 2,808.52.</p>
<p>Traders said comments from the German-French summit which marked progress on an agreement on a European Union budget stability pact helped push up the market, which had earlier hit a session high of 2,811.86 before retracing. The market was also buoyed by weak U.S. producer prices data and the bull run on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 48.25 points, or 1.75 percent, at 2,808.52. The CAC-40 futures contract was up 47 points at 2,793 from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was a hefty 11.3 billion francs.</p>
<p>One broker said although the meeting between President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Helmut Kohl yielded no dramatic fresh factors, the comments showed &quot;there was progress on the way to an agreement on the stability pact&quot;.</p>
<p>The low U.S. PPI figures were helping buoy the Paris market, he added.</p>
<p>The producer prices index for May showed a 0.3 percent decline when the market had been expecting a 0.1 percent rise.</p>
<p>The bourse has potential to rise further, given the waning of uncertainties over the euro, the run-up on Wall Street and strength in bond markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg's European equity strategist, Nicholas Stevenson, said he thought there would be little difference in macro-econmic management between the Jospin and Juppe governments, but there could be a danger from micro-economic measures such as a freeze on restructurings, a strong increase in the statutory minimum wage and higher corporate taxes.</p>
<p>But &quot;if the policy is solid, particularly on the micro-economic level and favourable on the European level, then the market will get to the same level as other European bourses and wipe out the current 10 percent discount, which is due to uncertainty,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Beyond the fundamentals, technical factors could support the market at the start of summer, said Martine Leonard, research director at CIC Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;The CAC could reach 2,900 in July. There are technical support factors, such as repayment of the Balladur bond (which matures July 16) and re-investment of dividends,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fewer companies are offering dividend payouts in shares this year as they are emphasing shareholder value,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>An SGE Delahaye note on the implications of a &quot;soft&quot; euro recommended European companies with strong dollar exposure, cyclical stocks but to be wary of the bank sector, which still needs restructuring.</p>
<p>It was positive on industrial stocks, with short-term attractions in paper, steel and cement and capital goods. Oils were also considered a buy due to their international exposure, but to go underweight on utilities.</p>
<p>But there could be a short-term fall, warned fund manager Jerome Poirel at Credit du Nord, who said the marekt was ripe for correction after a &quot;straight-line rise of 250-300 points.</p>
<p>&quot;But each drop will be an opportunity for those who missed the train in the run up to get into the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Elf rose 3.5 percent to 651 on 1.3 million shares, while Total gained 2.17 percent.</p>
<p>Renault jumped 6.02 percent to 147.99, Peugeot rose 3.97 percent to 603.</p>
<p>Publicis firmed 4.09 percent to 585 on a 1997 profit forecast of double-digit growth.</p>
