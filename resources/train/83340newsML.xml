<p>The Group of Seven leading industrial nations are expected to express some satisfaction on Saturday with the improving global economy and work on ways to ease the debt burden of the world's poorest countries.</p>
<p>The G7 discussions, held in conjunction with the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as the IMF is forcasting that the global economy will grow by 3.8 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>But Europe and Japan are not doing as well as the United States had hoped and U.S. officials, troubled that the pace of recovery will undermine American exports, will likely suggest that policymakers keep their foot on the pedal.</p>
<p>For its part, the United States is likely to be faced with questions about its willingness to take tough action to balance its government budget and hold inflation in check as its economy continues a 5-1/2 year expansion.</p>
<p>The IMF this week said the United States needed to raise interest rates to prevent its economy overheating and head off inflation that so far has been surprisingly absent -- although some think it may be waiting just around the next corner.</p>
<p>But overall, Saturday's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- is shaping up to be a low-key gathering free of the divisiveness evident at some past meetings.</p>
<p>Many countries are more preoccupied with events at home. The United States and Japan face elections and Europeans are attempting to complete work on launching a single currency. Even the pesky markets seem quiet.</p>
<p>Officials will examine a debt relief plan for the very poorest countries although its most controversial aspect -- the sale of some gold by the IMF -- has been temporarily sidestepped until it is more certain it can't be financed without it.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain had backed gold sales to finance such relief for poor nations. Germany and Italy were opposed, saying the money should come from bilateral contributions. For now, they have agreed to disagree.</p>
<p>The IMF has enough money on hand now to participate in the joint debt initiative with the World Bank and the Paris Club of creditor nations but if the plan gets as big as some want, it would likely need additional funding.</p>
<p>The G7, which forms the backbone of the Paris Club, is expected to sketch out on Saturday what creditor nations are prepared to do to help.</p>
<p>Deputy finance ministers from the G7 were trying to settle their differences on Friday over the contribution to be made by the Paris Club to the debt initiative, officials said.</p>
<p>The IMF-World Bank plan calls for 90 percent debt forgiveness by the Paris Club, up from 67 percent now, but World Bank president James Wolfensohn, a champion of the initiative, conceeded on Friday that it will be less than that.</p>
<p>He appeared confident, however, that it would go forward quickly despite these problems.</p>
<p>&quot;My guess is that between now and the end of the year we will have our first cases,&quot; Wolfensohn told reporters.</p>
