<p>Colombian cocaine king Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela was charged on Friday with offering a $1 million bribe to a judge who could substantially increase the lenient prison term he got last week, judicial officials said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the chief prosecutor's office said the attempted bribe was offered through go-betweens, including at least one court official, to a judge weighing evidence against Rodriguez in a case involving the shipment of 330 pounds (150 kg) of cocaine to Tampa, Florida in 1989.</p>
<p>The &quot;faceless&quot; judge was offered $1 million to rule that damaging testimony from a U.S. drug agent was inadmissible as evidence in the case, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Colombia has special tribunals of anonymous or faceless judges as a security measure to protect them against assassination attempts or intimidation by criminal drug gangs.</p>
<p>Rodriguez got to the judge for the first time last year through a court official, identified as Diego Fernando Gomez Zuluaga, who has since been detained, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Prison sentences are served concurrently in Colombia, so the three to six years that Rodriguez could get for bribery is unlikely to increase the light sentence handed down by a judge in Cali on Jan. 17. That sentence, which prompted a sharp rebuke from Washington, could set the billionaire leader of the Cali drug cartel free in as little as five years.</p>
<p>But the Bogota judge targeted by the bribe could sentence Rodriguez to up to 18 years if he convicts him for the drug shipment to Tampa, according to the spokeswoman for Prosecutor-general Alfonso Valdivieso.</p>
<p>A ruling in the case is expected by next week.</p>
