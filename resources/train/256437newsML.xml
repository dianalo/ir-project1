<p>Hong Kong stocks slid to a weak close on Friday afternoon, dragged down chiefly by nervousness in the outlook for international equity markets, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;If New York falls further, Hong Kong will fall further,&quot; said Carlton Poon, director of Hong Kong research at Worldsec International.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed down 269.21 points, or 2.06 percent, at 12,784.07, but off the day's low of 12,736.40. Turnover was very heavy at HK$10.10 billion, well up on Thursday's HK$8.24 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;We may have been overdone (on the upside), but Hong Kong's fundamentals are reasonably promising. I'm still bullish,&quot; Poon added.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index set a record high of 13,744.30 on November 28, a 36.4 percent rise from the start of the year, Poon said.</p>
<p>On Thursday,the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 98.81 points to 6,303.71. The fall come in the last hour of trading and was blamed on end-session program trading.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 11.43 points or 1.54 percent to 720.30.</p>
<p>But investors remained positive on the outlook for Hong Kong and other Asian markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow has been going through the roof for two years while Asia has lagged,&quot; said Christopher Day, joint managing director at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd.&quot; Don't tell me the trend in Asia is set by the Dow.&quot;</p>
<p>Hang Seng Index futures were also weaker. The December contract fell 370 points to close at 12,760 and the January contract was down 370 points to 12,820.</p>
<p>&quot;The December contract has fallen to the 50-day moving average. I think that downside is limited,&quot; said Amos Tse, head of Hong Kong sales at Mansion House Securities.</p>
<p>Properties led the correction, followed by property-related conglomerates in the commercial and industrial sector.</p>
<p>Market leaders showed the biggest net losses.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Properties fell HK$3.00 to HK$90.75 and Henderson Land fell HK$2.50 to HK$72.00. Hutchison dropped HK$2.50 to HK$55.75.</p>
<p>Swire Pacific shed HK$1.50 to HK$70.75.</p>
<p>International banking HSBC Holdings, the most actively traded issue, slumped HK$2.00 to HK$154.50 on trade of very heavy turnover of HK$1.09 billion.</p>
