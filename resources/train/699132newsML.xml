<title>USA: Fundamentals drive up U.S. foreign crude prices.</title>
<headline>Fundamentals drive up U.S. foreign crude prices.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fundamentals were seen driving up foreign crude prices in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, keeping most buyers on the sidelines, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic grades are getting expensive, the North Sea is tight....things seem to have bottomed out for the time being,&quot; said one crude seller. &quot;The market looks pretty constructive for the next couple of weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>The supply-demand balance was tightening for both ends of the crude spectrum, traders said.</p>
<p>The tight North Sea market and a narrow spread between West Texas Intermediate/Cushing and Brent were boosting regional and domestic sweet grades.</p>
<p>The August WTI/Brent spread was around $1.25-30 a barrel on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sour grades were moving up in response to the delay in the resumption of Iraqi crude exports under the U.N. oil-for-food deal. Iraqi Kirkuk and Basrah grades were not expected to re-enter the market until late July or early August at the earliest.</p>
<p>From the North Sea, a Norwegian company was showing Brent for around 20-25 cents a barrel under WTI for first-half August delivery. The same seller was also offering Oseberg at around the same price for end-July arrival.</p>
<p>West African availabilities were more plentiful. A U.S. company was close to selling 450,000 barrels of Nigerian Qua Iboe for $1.93 a barrel over Dated Brent for first-half August delivery.</p>
<p>A U.S. company was still looking for a home for 950,000 barrels of Qua Iboe for end-July, asking the cif equivalent of around 40 cents a barrel over Dated Brent fob.</p>
<p>A trading house was showing Forcados for August 10-20 at Dated Brent plus $1.75 a barrel, a price buyers deemed very aggressive.</p>
<p>A European company was also heard offering a waterborne cargo of Odudu, although this could not be immediately confirmed.</p>
<p>In Latin America, a top Argentine producer was showing one million barrels of Canadon Seco crude for loading in the second half of August.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Southern Cone, Chile and Uruguay were seeking to buy around one million barrels of crude apiece for August delivery in separate crude tenders, traders said.</p>
<p>Chile's state oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo (ENAP) was seeking to buy 960,000 barrels of crude oil for August 14-18 delivery.</p>
<p>Bids will be received and the tender awarded on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Uruguay's state oil refiner ANCAP was seeking to buy one million barrels of crude for August 18-28 delivery.</p>
<p>The Uruguayan tender will be awarded late on July 3.</p>
<p>Among regional sour crudes, Ecuadoran Oriente was on offer at $3.05-10 a barrel under WTI for August, while the Venezuelans were heard asking a discount &quot;tighter than $3.00&quot; for Mesa-30.</p>
