<headline>GM CEO wants &quot;top dollar&quot; for Hughes.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1997-01-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>General Motors Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said Sunday that the automaker wants to get &quot;top dollar&quot; for the defense operations of its Hughes Electronics Corp subsidiary.</p>
<p>Smith, speaking to reporters at an automotive conference here, declined to elaborate on the bidding process for the defense assets.</p>
<p>Asked if GM was holding out for a higher price, he said, &quot;No, we're just trying to get top dollar, that's all. We're not holding out.&quot;</p>
<p>Sources said on Friday that the bidding war for Hughes between defense giants Northrop Grumman Corp. and Raytheon Co. had intensified, with ofers now ranging from $9.8 billion to $10.4 billion.</p>
<p>Smith declined to say whether bids had been increased or when GM's board would decide on the future disposition of Hughes. GM has previously disclosed that it is looking at divestitures, alliances and acquisitions for its Hughes unit.</p>
<p>Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon initially bid $9 billion, while Northrop Grumman, based in Los Angeles, had offered $9.2 billion, sources said.</p>
<p>Analysts expect GM to take as much as $6 billion worth of stock from the winning bidder. To avoid a hefty tax bill, it has to hold those shares for a few years, so the future share price of the winner is crucial to the deal.</p>
<p>Later, following a speech to the Automotive News World Congress, Smith said the automaker's board was not planning to hold any special meetings in the next two days. GM's next regular board meeting is scheduled for held January 27.</p>
<p>However, Hughes' Chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, is scheduled to speak to the Economic Club of Detroit on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In his speech, Smith said the automaker planned to reduce its North American car platforms to seven from 16 currently. Future compact models, such as the next Chevrolet Cavalier, Saturn SL series and Opel Astra, will use a common platform that will result in &quot;enormous&quot; savings.</p>
<p>He also said Hughes' DirecTV satellite broadcasting service expected to grow its business by 20 percent over the next five years. It now has 2.3 million subscribersand will be available in argentina and Japan.</p>
<p>GM on Monday will announce a new system to distribute vehicles more rapidly that will reduce cost and improve customer satisfaction, Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith also said GM's Saturn car subsidiary planned to remain independent, despite the move of GM's other car divisions into its new headquarters in Detroit's Renaissance Center office complex.</p>
<p>&quot;We like to keep them as independent as we can,&quot; Smith said of Saturn.</p>
