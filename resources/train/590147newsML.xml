<p>Leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus are willing to attend direct talks for a settlement to the conflict dividing the island, a senior United Nations official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally it's a bad practice for spokesmen to give the position of other people, but they (the leaders) each of them said they were willing to accept the secretary-general's invitation if one was issued,&quot; Sir Kieran Prendergast, U.N. Under secretary-general for political affairs, told a news conference in the capital Nicosia.</p>
<p>Kofi Annan is expected to invite President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for talks in June. If the talks go ahead it will be the first known encounter between the two leaders in nearly three years.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to and I can't anticipate his (Annan's) decision but the secretary-general himself has made no secret of the fact that he would like to see direct talks resume by the middle of this year,&quot; Prendergast said.</p>
<p>The talks may start in New York, while the United Nations is looking at the idea of them continuing on a rotating basis with a European venue, he said.</p>
<p>Prendergast, who met the two leaders during his three-day stay on the island, will submit a progress report to Annan next week. He said his meetings with both leaders were &quot;valuable and informative&quot;.</p>
<p>The U.N. and a small army of mediators have been trying to reunite Cyprus under a federal umbrella since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the north in response to a brief Greek Cypriot coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>It intensified its bid to get stalled peace talks going following the killings of four Greek Cypriots along the U.N. patrolled buffer zone separating the two communities and the fatal shooting of a Turkish Cypriot sentry last summer.</p>
<p>Prendergast said the U.N. would do its best to promote a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately sucess depends on the willingness of the two sides to show flexibility and willingness to compromise,&quot; he said.</p>
