<p>President Saddam Hussein's eldest son Uday, who was shot six months ago, left hospital on Monday after a complete recovery, the official Iraqi News Agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;President Saddam Hussein's Uday left Ibn Sanaa hospital at two o'clock today after recovering from the aggressive incident on December 12, 1996,&quot; INA said.</p>
<p>Uday was reported to have been shot by unidentified gunmen as he was driving on December 12 in Baghdad's wealthy district of al-Mansour.</p>
<p>Uday underwent several operations, the last on April 12 on his left leg. Foreign doctors were said to have helped treat Uday, who is chairman of Iraq's National Olympic Committee, owns Babel newspaper and runs Shabab television.</p>
<p>Uday, who said he was hit in both legs, said after the last operation he expected to be on his feet in a few days or weeks. Last month Iraqi television showed what it said was pictures of Uday driving his car along the street where he was shot.</p>
<p>His television channel Shabab cut into its programme on Monday to declare his &quot;full recovery&quot; and started airing songs in praise of Uday.</p>
