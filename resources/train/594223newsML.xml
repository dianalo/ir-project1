<title>UK: North Sea crudes quiet, physical Brent firmer.</title>

<p>North Sea crude oil markets had an extremely quiet Monday with trade stiffled partly by the absence of European traders away on holiday, traders said.</p>
<p>A cargo of June 3-5 loading Brent crude oil was taken early from the paper chains and sold at a firmer July Brent -20 cents to a U.S. trader.</p>
<p>On Friday a May 28-30 cargo sold at July Brent -29 cents. Monday's buyer kept another of today's dates while Shell took the third cargo out before the five o'clock deadline.</p>
<p>The trader was heard to have a VLCC on subjects and most saw him needing to buy a further two cargoes to fill the ship.</p>
<p>Sellers were thus reluctant to give firm offers and played a &quot;wait and see&quot; strategy instead.</p>
<p>One of the Brent cargoes which was subject to five o' clocking on Friday was expected to have its loading dates defered and to be passed through the paper chains again on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The current high freight rates in Northwest Europe led to Monday's firm Dated Brent +33 cent deals for two early June loading Statfjord cargoes.</p>
<p>Traders took a mixed view on freight rates with some seeing further upside.</p>
<p>Others expected &quot;the bubble to burst&quot; and differentials on fixed freight crudes to come off as a result.</p>
<p>Outright July Brent on the IPE futures market lost some of Friday's gains to trade at 1710 GMT down 17 cents at $20.18 a barrel.</p>
<p>CFD and paper markets were very quiet with only one intermonth deal heard - a Brent Jul/Aug at +3 cents. The Jun/Jul spread talked +1/+3 cents while in late talk brokers pegged the Jul/Aug at +2/+3 cents. CFD's over the next four weeks were flat to around 1-2 cents in backwardation.</p>
