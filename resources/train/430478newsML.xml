<p>U.S. Gulf (USG) low sulphur diesel differentials surged higher by late Monday as traders moved to secure supplies ahead of the scheduling deadline.</p>
<p>However, outright prices for both distillates and gasoline fell as the NYMEX basis prices slipped sharply. April gasoline fell 1.31 cents by the close, while April heating oil shed 1.00 cent.</p>
<p>USG low sulphur barrels for front 8th cycle delivery on the Colonial Pipeline changed hands as high as 0.85 cent over the screen, up almost 0.50 cent on the day, as those needing barrels were forced to chase offers higher.</p>
<p>Gasoline differentials at both the USG and New York Harbor showed little movement despite some calls for a seasonal rally and the notoriously low gasoline inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;There's more potential for a pop than a fall back (in differentials), but I expect it to stay about flat for the next couple of weeks,&quot; one gasoline broker said.</p>
<p>The latest American Petroleum Institute data showed U.S. stocks were more than 10 million barrels below the year-ago levels.</p>
<p>NYH prompt conventional unleaded barrels were talked between about 2.50 and 2.75 cents below the screen, about even with Friday.</p>
<p>USG front 8th cycle conventional unleaded M2 barrels were offered at about 3.60 cents under the print, up about 0.10 cent.</p>
