<p>Key players in Colombia's economy shrugged off Washington's decision Friday to blacklist the country for a second year for its failure to crack down hard enough on the narcotics trade.</p>
<p>&quot;With oil income and the coffee bonanza, the effect of this (decertification) will not be very great,&quot; said Salomon Kalmanovitz, co-director of Colombia's central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Colombia's entry into the global marketplace is irreversible. The country is being more or less well-managed and that gives confidence to investors regardless of what the U.S. State Department says,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Kalmanovitz said the decision -- which effectively maintains the status quo for Colombia -- would not spark a run on the peso, as it might have in Mexico. The Colombian peso actually gained slightly in Friday's trade, closing up 0.7 to 1,074.3.</p>
<p>He also said the so-called &quot;decertification&quot; ruling would not dent the economy in a year that gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow between 4 percent and 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>A top Finance Ministry official also said that existing targets for foreign borrowing and the issuance of foreign debt remained in place.  </p>
<p>But some in Colombia even detected a ray of hope in comments by Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard, who said Colombia could win back partial certification if it toughened its anti-drug legislation further in the coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision was relatively positive because it opens the way for possible recertification if Colombia fulfills a number of conditions,&quot; said Clemente del Valle, head of public credit at the Finance Ministry.  </p>
<p>In the announcement, made by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, there was no reference to previous U.S. threats that renewed decertification would trigger economic sanctions.</p>
<p>The head of independent economic think-tank Fedesarollo, however, believed such threats had not been fully dispelled and would affect the business environment as it did last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The threat of U.S. sanctions is still hanging over the country...our relation with the United States is still in the balance,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Colombia plans to issue $1.4 billion in debt on foreign markets this year and has said it is looking for up to $800 million in foreign credits. Del Valle said those aims were not affected by the U.S. announcement.</p>
<p>Luis Carlos Villega, chairman of Colombia's influential National Industrialists Association (ANDI), also saw some hope in the report. He was one of several top Colombian industrialists who traveled to Washington in the last few weeks in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to lobby for recertification.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think today's decision will affect the economy in the slightest...on the contrary, because I think we have averted the threat of economic sanctions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Luis Fernando Uribe, head of the Medelln stock exchange, one of Colombia's three exchanges, said the decision was &quot;no surprise&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;For several weeks, the markets and economic players have been preparing themselves for this news,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there will be any negative reaction on the exchanges, and despite the speculation of recent days that Colombia would be decertified again, the market has remained firm,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>He said the death of Colombia's most notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar in December 1993 had a far greater impact on market sentiment, spurring a rally. Markets gained between 15 percent and 20 percent in a matter of days on the Medelln drug lord's death, Uribe said.</p>
<p>On Friday, Colombian stocks edged up slightly in sluggish trade, with gains attributed to a spate of positive earnings reports. Traders said the looming decertification had been safely factored in.</p>
