<headline>Boots makes 400 mln stg payout.</headline>

<p>British retailer and pharmacist Boots Co Plc said on Thursday it would hand 400.5 million pounds ($653.7 million) back to shareholders via a special dividend of 44.2 pence a share.</p>
<p>The payout was announced along with an 8.7 percent increase in annual profits before tax and exceptional items to 536.2 million pounds. Cash-rich Boots said the special dividend was in line with the group's stated policy of delivering shareholder value.</p>
<p>The retailer, also owner of car accessory chain Halfords and home DIY chain Do It All, has handed money back to shareholders on two other occasions via share buybacks; 511 million pounds in 1994 and 300 million in June last year.</p>
<p>The company said it had given shareholders a total of 1.7 billion pounds over the last three years in dividends, buybacks and tax credits.</p>
<p>The special payout, which has clearance from the UK tax authorities, carries a tax credit of 11.05 pence, or 100.1 million pounds in total.</p>
<p>Paying surplus cash to shareholders has become fashionable over the past few years. Last week, music giant EMI Plc and Thorn Plc between them promised investors nearly 600 million pounds.</p>
<p>But special dividends have become a more attractive route than share buybacks after changes to tax rules on such schemes last autumn.</p>
<p>Retail analysts had speculated Boots might propose a special dividend this month ahead of the Labour government's first budget in July, which could change the rules again.</p>
<p>The special dividend will be payable on June 13. After the payout Boots' will have pro forma gearing as of March 31 1997 of 10.5 percent.</p>
<p>Boots The Chemist, the group's main business, increased sales on a comparable store basis by 4.7 percent last year. Operating profits before exceptional items rose to 426.5 million pounds from 384.8 million.</p>
<p>Boots also announced plans to go ahead with its Advantage &quot;smart&quot; loyalty card, after regional trials, but gave no details on the timing or scope of the launch.</p>
