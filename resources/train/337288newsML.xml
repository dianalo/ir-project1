<headline>Czech official says fund fine news was withheld.</headline>

<p>A senior Czech finance ministry official acknowledged on Tuesday that regulators withheld disclosure that a major investment fund had been fined last year for irregularities.</p>
<p>Marie Jezkova, head of the ministry's investment fund supervision department, said a superior directed her not to publicise the case and the fine levied last June against fund manager, Harvard Capital &amp; Consulting.</p>
<p>The story, which broke anyway in December, has been at the centre of debate over Czech market transparency.  </p>
<p>Jezkova said there had been disagreement within the ministry about how Harvard might react to publicity.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't say that we all were afraid of being sued, but there was a certain directive on this issue that we were not to publish anything,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
<p>Despite the non-disclosure decision, the story broke in U.S. magazine Fortune, compelling the ministry to confirm in December that Harvard had been fined one million crowns and was forced to pay 200 million crowns plus interest in restitutions to its funds.  </p>
<p>But the finance ministry has not explained why it had not publicised the case against Harvard, one of the largest fund managers in the Czech market.</p>
<p>The ministry did not respond on Tuesday to requests for comments on Jezkova's remarks.</p>
<p>Harvard has no connection to the university where the investment group's founder Viktor Kozeny once studied. It manages an array of publicly-traded funds and companies built from post-Communist privatisation.</p>
<p>In January, Harvard acknowledged paying the fine, which it said was for violations of trading rules mainly related to its Guarantee &amp; Multiple Fund. It said it would continue to pay restitution, but denied shareholders suffered damage.</p>
<p>But the full decision against Harvard has yet to be released and the ministry has not detailed the charges, although Jezkova previously said Harvard had made trades of questionable value to the assets of the fund.</p>
<p>Jezkova's explanation of the Harvard case comes ahead of the official launch next week of a new Bureau for the Control of Securities (UPCP) in response to investor criticism of opaque and ineffective market regulation.</p>
