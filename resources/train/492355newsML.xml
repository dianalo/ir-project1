<p>Aquarius Exploration NL sees no big hurdles for the development of its Kroondal platinum project in South Africa and expects the project will start in the last quarter of 1997, director Michael Tuite told Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>Asked if the project had any major hurdles to overcome before development, Tuite said, &quot;The short answer is no.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The study is in place and we are looking at various options within it as to how we best capitalise on mining the thing,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>Last week Aquarius said results from additional drilling at its Kroondal tenement in South Africa's Bushveld Complex had lifted its platinum estimates by 25 percent to 2.6 million ounces.</p>
<p>South Africa accounts for 68 percent of the world's platinum group minerals production of 4.98 million ounces.</p>
<p>The company said the total resource of the Kroondal and Waterval portions of the reef had risen to 25.5 million tonnes at 5.4 grams per tonne (g/t) PGE (Platinum Group Elements) from 24.5 million tonnes at 5.1 g/t PGE.  </p>
<p>Aquarius said the PGE contained in the reef was now estimated at 4.5 million ounces, including 2.6 million ounces of platinum which was increased from an earlier estimate of two million ounces.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expecting we will know all the answers from the feasibility study in July - and on the basis that that is all positive I think we could get into it in the last quarter of this year,&quot; Tuite said.</p>
<p>The mine could start up as an open pit and then progressively go underground or there could be a variation of this approach, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The difference between underground and open pit is in the recoveries. The open pit will give us a 65 to 70 percent recovery compared to underground which is expected to give us a plus 90 percent recovery. The trade off being the mining cost.&quot;</p>
<p>Three mineral rights cover the areas containing the project and with Aquarius wholly owning two of these and 90 percent of the third tenement, the remaining 10 percent held by South African miner Randex Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made them (Randex) an offer to acquire the outstanding 10 percent which is being negotiated now,&quot; Tuite said.  </p>
<p>In December last year, Aquarius secured US$35 million of finance for the project from investment bank Rothschild Australia Ltd, to be finalised following the completion of the bankable feasibility study.</p>
<p>The financing consists of a project loan facility up to US$20 million with a hedging facility of up to US$15 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the project) will cost about US$30 million and possibly less depending on how we run the open pit and underground,&quot; Tuite said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The process plant will cost around US$20 million and then there is a provision ther for full scale underground development. If underground was deferred for a few years we could get the open pit up and running for relatively little capital and fund the underground development basically out of cash flow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuite said if more funds were needed for the project, these would likely come in the form of more equity from shareholders.</p>
