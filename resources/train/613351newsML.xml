<p>President Boris Yeltsin will be feted by Russia's former Cold War foes in NATO on Tuesday when they sign a deal in Paris opening a new era in relations, but few champagne corks will be popping back home in Moscow.</p>
<p>The agreement addresses some of Russia's concerns over the Western defence alliance's eastward expansion but does not prevent the enlargement which Yeltsin once said could ignite the &quot;flame of war&quot; across Europe.</p>
<p>Communists, nationalists and even some liberals say the accord implies Russian acceptance of NATO expansion and amounts to a capitulation. Yeltsin's efforts to convince them he has won major concessions against the odds have so far failed.</p>
<p>&quot;What does all this mean? It means the betrayal of all our ancestors' efforts for the last 400 to 500 years,&quot; said Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the opposition Communist Party.</p>
<p>The agreement, or Founding Act, does not require parliamentary ratification.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin wants widespread approval to lend credence to his claims that it is a diplomatic triumph and to reinforce his image as the father of the nation who is trying to lay the foundations of a secure and prosperous state.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 66, says the agreement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation achieved much more than could have been expected at the start of talks when NATO made clear expansion into eastern Europe would go ahead whatever Russia said or did.</p>
<p>The gains, he says, are binding guarantees that NATO will not post nuclear weapons or build up its forces on the territory of the new members it takes in from the former Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>The creation of a joint Russia-NATO council also gives Moscow a say in some matters which directly affect its security.</p>
<p>The Kremlin acknowledges the deal is not perfect, but says completing an agreement to make the best of a bad situation was a better option than refusing to negotiate.</p>
<p>The latter option could have left Russia isolated, without a say in European security and put its entire relationship with the West in doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;The supreme aim, the aim of preserving trust between Russia and the West, between Russia and the NATO states, was like a lodestar for the participants in the talks,&quot; said Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.</p>
<p>&quot;It was possible, by keeping to this aim, to reach a reasonable and balanced agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Critics disagree. They say NATO disarmed Russia's opposition to its expansion, due to start when the alliance issues the first membership invitations in July, and in return received only vague promises which are not legally binding.</p>
<p>&quot;What did Russia get as a result of concluding this agreement? In my view, Russia got only the illusion that it is being reckoned with,&quot; said Andranik Migranyan, a member of Yeltsin's loose advisory Presidential Council.</p>
<p>&quot;What did the West get? In my opinion, the West and NATO got the main thing that they wanted. They got Russia's consent to NATO expansion.&quot;</p>
<p>Critics and supporters of the agreement alike say both sides face hard work ensuring relations between Russia and the West remain on track, even after the agreement is signed.</p>
<p>Moscow regards NATO membership for former Soviet republics as unacceptable. Tough negotiations lie ahead if the West tries to draw in these newly independent states, a process which could yet unravel all that has been achieved.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that sensible leaders in the West will not want to play Russian roulette,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said, referring to the daredevil game in which gamblers put one bullet in a six-shot revolver, spin the chamber, put the gun to their heads and fire.</p>
