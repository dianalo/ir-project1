<p>The Singapore dollar sank to a 32-month low of 1.4738 against the U.S. dollar on Thursday morning after stop losses were triggered at the 1.4700 level, said forex dealers.  </p>
<p>The Sing dollar was last traded near these levels since mid-November 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop losses were triggered after it broke 1.4700 this morning,&quot; said the regional currency chief at a European bank.</p>
<p>He said the selling of the local currency had started on Wednesday following Finance Minister Richard Hu's comments in parliament on the Singapore dollar.</p>
<p>Hu had said that Singapore had a flexible exchange rate based on market demand.</p>
<p>He also said Singapore's export competitiveness has not been hurt by the recent weakness of some regional currencies against the Singapore dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The market read his remarks as that the Monetary Authority of Singapore was not concerned with the recent weakness in the Sing. The slide would be steady and gradual,&quot; said the dealer.</p>
<p>Selling this morning was by hedge funds and corporates after the stop losses were triggered above 1.4700, said dealers.</p>
