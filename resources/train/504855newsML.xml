<p>A huge fire destroyed part of this northern Italian city's 15th century cathedral early on Saturday but church officials said the famous Turin shroud, which was kept in one of its chapels, had been saved by a &quot;miracle&quot;.</p>
<p>The blaze also swept through part of an adjacent royal palace, now a museum, where hours earlier United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan had attended a gala dinner in his honour, accompanied by numerous dignitaries.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the flames, which lit up the night sky in the prosperous industrial city. Firefighters said they managed to contain the blaze almost seven hours after it took hold.</p>
<p>&quot;The fire is under control but we're still working very hard to minimise the risks,&quot; Michele Ferraro, head of the fire rescue service, told Reuters. He added it was too soon to say how the blaze started.</p>
<p>Senior police officers also were unsure how the fire broke out, but the Italian news agency Ansa quoted one official as saying an electrical short-circuit was a possiblity.</p>
<p>Security guards reported seeing flames shortly before midnight from the back of the cathedral, in the Guarini chapel, which was built specifically to house the mysterious shroud and was undergoing restoration work.</p>
<p>The shroud, a piece of cloth imprinted with the image of a man's body that many Roman Catholic believers take to be the figure of Christ after his crucifixion, was stored behind bullet-proof glass in the ornate chapel in a silver box.</p>
<p>Firemen, undeterred by the suffocating heat and collapsing roof timbers, rushed to save the religious relic -- one of the most important in the Catholic world.</p>
<p>They smashed through the sturdy protective covering with sledge hammers and yanked the box to safety, carrying it out into the square in front of the cathedral where thousands of people had gathered to watch the drama unfold.</p>
<p>A cheer went up when word spread that the shroud had been saved, many people weeping openly, and the firemen embraced each other in relief.</p>
<p>&quot;It's intact, it's a miracle,&quot; Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini said after he had opened the box and examined the cloth. The relic was then taken to his Turin residence for safe-keeping.</p>
<p>Fireman Mario Trematore said he did not believe they had the time to break the glass and rescue the shroud. &quot;It seemed as though everything was about to collapse on top of us,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;God gave me the strength to break that glass.&quot;</p>
<p>Fire officials said that besides gutting the Guarini chapel, the blaze had seriously damaged part of the main altar and apse along with the top two floors of the royal palace's western tower, which backs on to the cathedral.</p>
<p>It was not clear what art work had been destroyed in the palace-turned-museum, but officials said the most valuable part of the collection had been saved.</p>
<p>Shortly before the alarm was raised, the U.N. secretary general had left the palace after the dinner which was also attended by former prime minister Giulio Andreotti and industrialist Giovanni Agnelli.</p>
<p>Annan is in Turin to inaugurate a staff college of the International Labour Organisation later on Saturday.</p>
<p>It was the second time in just over a year that a historic Italian building has been damaged by fire.</p>
<p>Venice's famous Fenice opera house was gutted in January 1996 in a blaze which magistrates are still investigating. Some newspapers have suggested the Mafia might have started that fire.</p>
