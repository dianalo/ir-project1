<p>Malaysian rubber prices were little changed at noon session as buyers continued to sideline due to uncertainty in the Tokyo market and lack of leads at the start of the week, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is Monday. As usual we don't expect much happening,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;We are waiting for more inquiries from Far East later. The market is expecting some further covering from Europe this week ahead of the summer holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>Business could be slow as many European consumers have already committed their buying programmes before the summer vacation, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Some local dealers were also covering for forward positions but producers were not willing to commit at current prices.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect higher levels in the long-term when expected monsoon rains could limit tapping and push up prices,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>At midday, July RSS1 ended steady at Friday's 282.50 cents ($1.12) a kg but July SMR 20 slipped half a cent to 258 cents.</p>
<p>A Malaysia-based shipping agent quoted freight rates for rubber from Malaysia to Rotterdam at $800 per TEU (or 20-ft container), and $1,700 per two-TEU containers (or 40-ft container). --Tan Lee Lee 275-6834 ($1-2.5160 ringgit)</p>
