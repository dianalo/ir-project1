<title>AUSTRALIA: CSR sells some units in U.S. and Britain.</title>
<headline>CSR sells some units in U.S. and Britain.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-04-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSR Ltd said on Wednesday that it sold three building and construction materials businesses in the United States and United Kingdom for a total of about A$70 million.  </p>
<p>The diversified industrial group, which also has timber and aluminium interests, said it sold its Synkoloid and Beadex businesses in the northwest United States and its Humes business in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The U.S. assets were acquired in 1987 and make and distribute gypsum-based jointing compounds, plasterboard corner trims and other accessories for the gypsum wallboard market.</p>
<p>The Humes business makes concrete pipes and was acquired by CSR in 1988. CSR said the sales were part of a continuing divestments programme and the funds raised would significantly exceed aggregate book value.  </p>
<p>&quot;The profit on the sale will be absorbed largely by significant restructuring costs incurred over the last six months in the Australian building and construction materials business,&quot; CSR said.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest sales bring total divestments during the year ended March 1997 to more than A$200 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The sale of the major part of the American Aggregates business for about A$290 million is still expected to be completed during the next six weeks,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>CSR did not identify the buyer of each of the three businesses.  </p>
<p>CSR shares closed five cents lower at A$4.65 on Wednesday.</p>
