<text>
<p>Singapore shares ended weaker on Friday spurred by profit-taking, with newly-issued stocks taking centre-stage, fuelled by speculative interest.</p>
<p>New and small capitalisation issues were most active, with debut stock Second Chance garnering highest volume at 42 million shares. The stock went on an early ascent to Singapore $0.60, up from its S$0.30 issue price, and then fell back to S$0.515.</p>
<p>Lung Kee Metal also drew interest, hitting a high of US$0.81, up from its issue price of $0.55 and ended at $0.78.</p>
<p>The 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed at 2,242.71, down 5.63 points.  </p>
<p>Volume was a robust 250 million shares with a total of 142 stocks rising and 232 stocks falling.</p>
<p>&quot;Funds got active in some of the new shares, like Lung Kee, because analysts called buying at these levels,&quot; a dealer with a local securities firm said.</p>
<p>Among the gainers was Malaysian stockbroking firm Rashid Hussain, which put on S$0.60 to S$11.50 as investors bet on its recent stake in an Indonesian bank.</p>
<p>Banks were broadly weaker with UOB Foreign down S$0.70 to $16.50, and OCBC Foreign down S$0.60 to $18.80.</p>
