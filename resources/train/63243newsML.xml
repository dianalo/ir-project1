<p>New York's Public Service Commission will seek an expedited review of the lawsuit challenging its electric industry deregulation order, spokesman Dave Flanagan told Reuters Thursday.</p>
<p>The suit was filed in state court in Albany Wednesday by the Energy Association of New York State and its eight member companies, which said they had to act no later than this week to preserve their right to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>In a statement, Chairman John O'Marra said the &quot;commission is dissappointed that the utilities have filed this lawsuit.&quot;  </p>
<p>He went on to say &quot;they rejected a commission proposal that would have preserved their legal rights and allowed collaboration to proceed without this distraction.&quot;</p>
<p>Flanagan said the commission proposed an agreement to preserve the utilities' right to appeal.</p>
<p>Energy Association President Howard Shapiro said &quot;there was some discussion in that area,&quot; but the proposal was &quot;viewed as inadequate...(and) minimal&quot; by utility lawyers.</p>
<p>He said it was &quot;great&quot; that the commission would seek an expedited review of the suit.</p>
<p>O'Mara's statement concluded &quot;We are confident that the court will uphold our order. Meanwhile, we will continue implementation of (the decision) according to the schedule in the order.&quot;</p>
<p>The association's member utilities are Brooklyn Union Gas Co, Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp, Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc, Long Island Lighting Co, New York State Electric &amp; Gas Corp, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp, Orange and Rockland Utilities Inc and Rochester Gas and Electric Corp. </p>
