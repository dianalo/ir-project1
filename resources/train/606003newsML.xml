<p>Profits of India's largest private steelmaker Tata Iron and Steel Company Ltd (TISCO) are seen flat-to-lower in 1996/97 (April-March) because of a sluggish market and tight margins, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see profits rising,&quot; said Hozefa Topiwalla, steel analyst at brokerage firm First Global Finance. &quot;Profits will be flat... there might be a minor downside.&quot;</p>
<p>He had forecast a net profit of 5.89 billion rupees against 5.67 billion in 1995/96, but said the profit was likely to be lower.</p>
<p>TISCO's full-year results are due on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts said the firm was unable to raise prices to cover higher costs because of poor conditions, and sales volume growth was lower than expected.</p>
<p>The company said in April that it sold 2.44 million tonnes of steel in the year ended March 31, 1997, up three percent from 2.36 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;At the start of the year we had expected volume growth of six to seven percent,&quot; said Aniruddha Dange, analyst at ICICI Securities and Finance Company (I-Sec).</p>
<p>&quot;Margins were squeezed as it was not able to pass on higher costs to consumers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dange forecast net profit at 5.05 billion rupees.</p>
<p>The cement division made a small operating profit in the first half but weak market conditions would have hit operations in the second half, resulting in losses, Topiwalla said.</p>
<p>Lower ferro chromium prices would also slice profits in 1996/97, he said, adding that earnings the previous year were boosted by higher ferro chromium prices.</p>
<p>TISCO's continuing capital expenditure programme was mainly to modernise or upgrade facilities without additions to capacity, Topiwalla said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are having a sell on the stock,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dange said he expected the share to be a market performer.</p>
<p>Analysts saw little prospect of an upturn in 1997/98 with steel demand seen growing at four percent in the first half, and rising to six percent in the second half and to 7.5 percent in 1998/99.</p>
<p>&quot;The modestly improving demand outlook may not translate into pricing flexibility for domestic manufacturers, especially of hot rolled coils (HRC) because of rising supply in 1998/99,&quot; Kotak Securities and its affiliate Goldman Sachs said in a recent report.</p>
<p>It said domestic HRC output would rise by 2.1 million tonnes over the next 24 months.</p>
<p>HRC is TISCO's major product category, which accounted for 1.04 million tonnes out of total saleable steel production of 2.81 million tonnes in 1996/97. ($1 = 35.7 rupees)</p>
