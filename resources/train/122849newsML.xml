<p>On the south end of Guatemala City's Mateo Flores Stadium early on Thursday hundreds of shoes, pieces of clothing and bloodstains littered the seats, silent reminders of the tragedy that occurred there on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At least 79 people were killed before a World Cup qualifying match between Guatemala and Costa Rica when one section of the stands became so overcrowded it caused an avalanche of humanity, with fans tumbling over one another down toward the playing field.</p>
<p>Later the dead were lined up at one end of the field. They either suffocated or were crushed to death.</p>
<p>At the nearby San Juan de Dios Hospital in downtown Guatemala City, hundreds of hysterical relatives gathered at the emergency entrance clamouring for news of their loved ones.</p>
<p>A loudspeaker at the hospital door boomed out names of the wounded and dead, periodically provoking howls of anguish from friends and relatives.</p>
<p>The hospital admitted more than 80 injured, suffering broken limbs and other injuries, Salvador Lopez, the deputy health minister health, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A similar number of injured were admitted to the Roosevelt Hospital, also in Guatemala City, he said.</p>
<p>Outside the hospital, dazed soccer fans fresh from the stadium, their faces still painted in patriotic blue and white, also sought news of friends injured in the tragedy.</p>
<p>Alberto Chamale, a 46-year-old construction worker, limping and disoriented, told Reuters he lost four brothers and a niece who all died near him in the crush at the south end of the stadium.</p>
<p>Choking back tears, he said emergency workers told him his dead relatives were among the bodies laid out on the field.</p>
<p>Chamale said the bleachers at that end of the stadium were clearly filled to capacity more than an hour before the game, but ticket-takers began letting more people in until people lost their balance and began falling on top of each other.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Guatemalan soccer) federation is at fault for letting in too many people,&quot; Chamale said.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the tragedy at the stadium, a cacophony of sirens and screams of pain contributed to the sense of pandemonium as firefighters and security guards were overwhelmed by the mass of crushed bodies.</p>
<p>Outside the stadium desperate cries sounded out as hundreds of people sought to enter to learn the fate of friends and relatives. Outnumbered police did all they could to maintain control.</p>
<p>&quot;I was seated in the bleachers, but they were full,&quot; one of the injured, Carlos Garcia, told Reuters, clenching his teeth to fight back the pain of a broken leg and bruised head. &quot;Then more people were let it. I only fled when they began to fall on top of us. I don't know anything more.&quot;</p>
