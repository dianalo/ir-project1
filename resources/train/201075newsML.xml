<p>The UK housing market enjoyed a better performance in October than in September for the first time since 1982, according to the latest survey of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said.</p>
<p>October showed the 14th consecutive month-on-month increase in the proportion of chartered surveyors reporting price increases, prompted by the shortage of properties for sale.</p>
<p>&quot;Many potential vendors are waiting for higher prices in 1997, while would-be purchasers become increasingly frustrated by the lack of choice. There are reports of panic buying in some areas,&quot; said RICS housing market spokesman Ian Perry.</p>
<p>A net balance of 44 percent of chartered surveyors reported rising prices across England and Wales for the three months to the end of October.</p>
<p>The survey said the market imbalance was fuelled by a general rise in demand, a rush to beat the deadline on attractive fixed-rate mortgage offers and more people wanting to buy houses rather than rent.</p>
<p>Perry said a more properties were expected on the market in the New Year, which would tend to temper price rises. &quot;The &quot;wait and see' attitude of potential vendors has caused a bottleneck of demand. We expect this to ease next year,&quot; he added.</p>
