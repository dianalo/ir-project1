<p>An Israeli soldier who shot and wounded seven Palestinians in Hebron on New Year's Day has been charged with attempted murder, the army said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It said a military court decided Noam Friedman, a 22-year-old conscript, was now fit to stand trial, after ruling last February that he must be confined to a psychiatric hospital and would not be charged.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the clear public interest in this case and because in contrast to the past Friedman is now fit to stand trial, an indictment was issued,&quot; the army said in a statement.</p>
<p>The indictment includes charges of attempted murder, insubordination and trying to persuade others to become accessories to murder, the statement said.</p>
<p>Friedman shot into a crowd of Palestinians in a Hebron marketplace on January 1 as Israel was negotiating the handover of most of the town to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>He told the court later he was trying to prevent Israel and the PLO from reaching a deal.</p>
<p>A team of psychiatrists found Friedman was schizophrenic and he was confined to a mental facility. Last month he was moved to an open ward in the clinic and allowed to spend time at home, a decision that was bitterly condemned by Palestinians.</p>
<p>The statement said the army was asking the court to transfer Friedman, a religious Jew who lives in a West Bank settlement, back to the the closed ward.</p>
<p>An Israeli officer overpowered Friedman shortly after he opened fire from his M-16 automatic rifle.</p>
<p>Two weeks later Israel handed over 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian self-rule under the terms of their peace deal. It retains control over 20 percent of the town where around 400 Jewish settlers live.</p>
