<title>NEW ZEALAND: New Zealand shares end strong before CPI.</title>
<headline>New Zealand shares end strong before CPI.</headline>
<text>
<p>* Shares inch higher on second day of high turnover</p>
<p>* Market close to historic highs</p>
<p>* Low CPI, fall in rates could provide fresh impetus  </p>
<p>The top-40 index is testing key chart points close to its life high of 2,444.80, set in February 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of people selling into this strength, thinking that maybe it won't carry through that level, but it may well get through it yet, we don't know,&quot; said Richard Burton at Cavill White.</p>
<p>With the Reserve Bank forecasting quarterly underlying inflation of 0.5 percent for an annual 2.3 percent, brokers said a lower number could push interest rates lower and give equities a fresh shot in the arm. Burton said the other key factor would be the direction of the U.S. market.  </p>
<p>Among the leaders, all the Fletcher Challenge stocks were strong on good volume and Carter Holt Harvey made up ground from Wednesday, adding four to $3.33.</p>
<p>&quot;Pulp and paper sectors around the world have been looking much better in recent weeks. That continued in Fletcher Paper,&quot; Davenport said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere brewer DB firmed two to $0.99 on volume of 3.76 million shares and Tourism Holdings jumped 13 to $2.65.</p>
