<p>Poland's Solidarity-led alliance of right-wing parties will unveil its programme and present its parliamentary candidates at a convention to be held in May or June, a spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;At our national convention, the Solidarity Election Action (AWS) will present its programme and its Sejm (lower house) and Senate candidates,&quot; PAP news agency quoted Piotr Zak as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be preceded by regional conventions in which the members of all organisations comprising the AWS may participate,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The AWS was set up last June by the Solidarity trade union as a broad coalition of some two dozen centre-right and rightist parties to defeat the ex-communist-led coalition that has ruled Poland since 1993.</p>
<p>A recent public opinion poll showed that the AWS had a good chance of winning the elections, due to be held in September.</p>
<p>The AWS enjoyed the support of 29 percent of those surveyed, compared with 25 percent for the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance.</p>
