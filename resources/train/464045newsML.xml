<p>It will be five years before sheep-cloners PPL Therapeutics Plc have a product on the market, and investors can expect to see more losses in the near future, Managing Director Ron James said on Monday.</p>
<p>But the company said it held patents on its controversial cloning techniques and on potential new products that should keep investors interested.</p>
<p>James said PPL, which stunned the world by cloning an adult sheep named Dolly, would continue to concentrate on creating transgenic animals. These would include sheep, cattle, rabbits and pigs genetically engineered to produce human proteins.</p>
<p>But he warned the technology was still clumsy and unreliable, although he was confident this would improve.</p>
<p>Asked how long before PPL had a product on the market, James answered: &quot;It's at least five years away.&quot;</p>
<p>Announcing its first annual results since the company was listed last year, PPL reported a pre-tax loss of 6.2 million stg ($9.9 million). Turnover was 2.5 million stg.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we might see this level of turnover continue,&quot; said Richard Cruse, PPL's finance director. &quot;We will also expect to see the 8.25 million stg (in development costs) increase again.&quot;</p>
<p>Turnover fell from 4 million stg when Bayer pulled out its support from PPL's lead product, alpha anti-trypsin, a human protein produced in milk from genetically engineered sheep. AAT is about to begin Phase II clinical trials for use in treating cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>James said PPL hoped to find a partner for AAT by the middle of next year. &quot;Our plan here is to get a partner on board at the end of the phase II trial,&quot; he said. &quot;We obviously need to start *talking to them before then and we are talking to potential partners now.&quot;</p>
<p>Commercial arrangements were underway for marketing AAT, fibrinogen, activated protein C with Novo Nordisk, Factor VIIA with Novo Nordisk, Factor IX and two unidentified milk products, one nutritional supplement with Euro Pharma Co and another with Wyeth.</p>
<p>&quot;We're progressing the whole of the pipeline on time and to schedule,&quot; James said.</p>
<p>Four new potential products showed hope, James added. One was a calcitonin peptide, produced in transgenic rabbit milk, which might be of use in treating osteoporosis and Paget's Disease.</p>
<p>Another product PPL had negotiated the rights to was EC SOD (extracellular super oxide dismutase), which James saw potential in treating Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and in preserving human organs for transplant.</p>
<p>There was also a novel anti-protease, a chemical that works against elastase, an enzyme implicated in inflammation and of possible use in ARDS, wound healing and cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>The fourth was a range of novel collagen compounds. Collagen holds the body together and can be used in tissue modelling. James said PPL could use its genetic engineering techniques to tailor collagens for researchers. ($ = 0.623 British Pounds)</p>
