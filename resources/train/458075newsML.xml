<p>As the clock of history ticks ever louder toward Hong Kong's handover to communist China, the anti-communist Chinese outpost of Taiwan is fretting: Can Beijing use the transition to squeeze us?</p>
<p>&quot;We know they will try to exact some concessions from us, but how far will they go? We just don't know,&quot; said former Taiwan government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming, a respected expert on China-Taiwan relations.</p>
<p>Time is running out -- March 23 marks the start of the 100-day countdown to Hong Kong's handover to China at midnight, June 30 -- and Taiwan officials are urging Beijing to end a 21-month-old freeze on talks and jointly tackle a long list of murky issues relating to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>What documents will Taiwan people need to visit Hong Kong? What flag should Taiwan ships fly when entering Hong Kong? Will Hong Kong recognise official papers issued by Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government? And how safe are Taiwan's billions of dollars of Hong Kong investments?</p>
<p>&quot;There are many matters...between Taiwan and Hong Kong that we need to discuss with communist China,&quot; said an official of the Taiwan cabinet's policy-making Mainland Affairs Council.</p>
<p>&quot;It's better for both sides to talk things over.&quot;</p>
<p>NEW CHAPTER IN CHINA'S DORMANT CIVIL WAR</p>
<p>The end of Hong Kong's British colonial era is a major chapter in China's long-dormant civil war pitting the communists, who took over the mainland in 1949, against the Nationalists, who fled with their Republic of China government into exile on Taiwan.</p>
<p>The intervening 48 years have seen Taiwan flower into an advanced economy and, since 1987, swap iron-fisted Nationalist rule and martial law for a gentle, thriving democracy where support for &quot;retaking the mainland&quot; has all but dried up.</p>
<p>Though the government still espouses eventual reunification with China, democracy has stirred long-suppressed yearnings for a Republic of Taiwan independent of the mainland.</p>
<p>In the same period the mainland has endured chaos, but since 1979 has found stability, a nascent prosperity and the means to build a prodigious military. This has emboldened Beijing's communists in their dream of finishing the civil war by absorbing Taiwan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's imminent absorption by China, hailed by Beijing as a model for Taiwan's eventual &quot;return to the motherland&quot;, has fuelled worries over Taiwan's intimate ties to the colony.</p>
<p>The Nationalists, one of the world's richest political parties, have already acted to protect millions of U.S. dollars in Hong Kong assets by shunting them to Singapore.</p>
<p>Taiwan investors, still barred from dealing officially with China, have long used Hong Kong as a conduit for indirect trade and, since 1989, some US$30 billion in China-bound investment.</p>
<p>Investors hope Beijing, keeping economic self-interest in mind, will not use Hong Kong to hold their China investments hostage in a bid to extract political concessions from Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;If the People's Republic is smart, they will leave things as they are,&quot; said analyst Shaw.</p>
<p>&quot;If they squeeze us it will damage our relations with Hong Kong. Any damage to Hong Kong will hurt the mainland itself. We aren't defenceless. They need us just as much as we need them.&quot;</p>
<p>TAIWAN SAYS NOT POWERLESS TO PRESSURE CHINA</p>
<p>Taipei now limits the size of indirect China investments and warns local firms to invest cautiously to avoid a politically risky overdependence on Taiwan's main adversary -- but has not issued a similar caution on Hong Kong investments.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we have counter-measures if things turn nasty or become different from expectations,&quot; said the mainland affairs official, adding it was &quot;not convenient&quot; to disclose them.</p>
<p>&quot;Our stance is very clear,&quot; he added. &quot;We hope both sides can treat each other equally and with dignity. But again, there are many things needed to be discussed. ...It's in everyone's best interest to maintain close Taiwan-Hong Kong relations.&quot;</p>
<p>Only in civil aviation have the sides set new ground rules. They signed a June 1996 accord that will maintain and even deepen air links between Taiwan, Hong Kong and the mainland.</p>
<p>Yet despite hopes that the deal would provide a framework for a range of other talks, virtually nothing has gelled.</p>
<p>In shipping, Taiwan and China allowed their main shippers in January to work out a modest accord allowing quasi-direct routes across the Taiwan strait, and appeared in recent weeks to be on the verge of a direct-shipping breakthrough.</p>
<p>But talks on Taiwan-Hong Kong shipping logistics may not open before May, leaving little time to hammer out a deal.</p>
<p>Taiwan says it has no problem accepting shipping documents bearing official Beijing markings but does not know if China will reciprocate, as this could be seen to confer legitimacy on Taiwan's Republic of China government.</p>
<p>TAIWAN SAYS PROBLEM ON MAINLAND'S SIDE</p>
<p>&quot;We will treat it as one country, two areas. We are two political entities,&quot; the Taiwan official said. &quot;The problem lies not on our side but on the side of communist China.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan hopes China will not expel the government-financed Chung Hwa Travel Agency office that now distributes Taiwan visas to international travellers in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As for Taiwan travellers, experts say Hong Kong has shown no sign of changing a requirement that they obtain a special entry permit before arriving in the territory.</p>
<p>Some speculate, however, that Beijing may require them to obtain from the Public Security Ministry a &quot;Taiwan Compatriot Certificate&quot;, in effect obliging Taiwan people to register with China's central government to qualify for Hong Kong visits.</p>
<p>Under such restrictions, Hong Kong would be off-limits to senior Taiwan officials.</p>
<p>The imminent handover has sown division on Taiwan itself.</p>
<p>It was only on Tuesday, after months of bickering and delay, that Taiwan's parliament enacted a law to govern Taiwan's ties with Hong Kong and, in 1999, with Portuguese-run Macau after it comes under Beijing's rule.</p>
<p>Lawmakers opposed to unification had pressed for a law that would not undermine the island's chances for independence, while pro-unification deputies pushed to keep mainland options open.</p>
