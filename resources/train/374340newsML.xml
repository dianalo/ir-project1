<title>BELGIUM: EU strengthens food safety services.</title>
<headline>EU strengthens food safety services.</headline>

<p>The European Commission announced a major reorginisation of its human food safety services on Wednesday following strong criticism of the way it handled the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission, in order to provide the necessary political impulse and to coordinate its actions, has created a group of commissioners to oversee food health,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The group, which will be headed by consumer affairs commissioner Emma Bonino, will control the activities of seven scientific committees.</p>
<p>The EU executive's powerful agriculture directorate, which previously drafted and implemented measures to control the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and checked how well they were being enforced, has been criticised for giving priority to aiding beef farmers.</p>
<p>In another move, the Commission also gave control of a new veterinary inspection office -- which will be based in Ireland -- to Bonino.</p>
<p>A special unit to evaluate public health risks will also be put under her control. But member states are reluctant to give up control of such a sensitive area and provide the necessary funds.</p>
<p>The commission said it will present within two months proposals to improve its public and animal health services.</p>
<p>A report by a special European Parliament committee of inquiry has strongly attacked the Commission and Britain, where the disease is most prevalent, for serious errors after London admitted in March 1996 that BSE could be passed to humans.</p>
