<p>A sharp slump in new-car sales dragged retail stores' business down in November, the Commerce Department said Thursday, though weakness was widespread in many other sectors as well.</p>
<p>Total retail sales fell 0.4 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted $206.1 billion after a revised 0.3 percent rise in October. Wall Street economists had forecast November sales would rise 0.3 percent in the approach to the Christmas shopping season instead of decline.</p>
<p>Auto-dealer sales plummeted 2.6 percent to $49.5 billion -- the biggest drop since a 3.5 percent fall in April, when they were down 3.5 percent. Auto sales had risen a slight 0.1 percent in October.</p>
<p>New cars account for about one-fifth of total retail sales, so swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures. Excluding cars, retail sales were up 0.3 percent last month after gaining 0.4 percent in October.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers are telling you that the economy has moderate forward momentum and that inflation remains under control,&quot; said Samual Kahan, president of A.S.K. Financial Research.</p>
<p>&quot;The weakness in automobile sales was a little bit of a surprise but given the volatility of that series, people will focus more on the total, excluding automobiles, which was up 0.3 percent. That tells you that consumer spending through November continues to be soft.&quot;</p>
<p>Commerce said its November figures were adjusted to reflect the fact that the Thanksgiving Day holiday -- which traditionally marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping season -- occurred late this year. It said the effect of the adjustment factor is to increase November sales when Thanksgiving is late.</p>
<p>Sales of all types of durable goods, from cars to hardware and building materials, fell 1.1 percent in November to $83.5 billion after rising 0.3 percent in October. Sales of non-durable goods like food and clothing edged up 0.1 percent to $122.5 billion following a 0.4 percent October increase.</p>
<p>The report implied a soft start to the holiday sales season, a critical few weeks when many retailers make up to half their annual sales and profits.</p>
<p>Sales by general merchandise stores fell 0.6 percent to $25.8 billion after a 0.4 percent gain in October. At apparel stores, sales of clothing dropped 0.9 percent to $9.4 billion after falling 0.6 percent in October.</p>
<p>Lackluster consumer spending was a key reason that the rate of national economic growth, measured by gross domestic product, slowed to 2 percent in the third quarter from 4.7 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Most analysts anticipate at least a modest pickup in growth in the closing quarter, partly because of stronger Christmas sales prompted by steady job growth and higher incomes.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that most people by the end of the day are going to say Christmas sales aren't over until Christmas is over. We have to wait and look at what the December figures look like,&quot; said James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc.</p>
<p>October retail sales previously were reported rising 0.2 percent, but that was revised upward slightly.</p>
<p>Sales by food stores fell 0.2 percent last month following a 0.1 percent October rise.</p>
<p>Sales at restaurants declined 0.4 percent to $19.6 billion in November after falling 0.2 percent in October.</p>
<p>Gasoline service station sales were up 1.2 percent to $13.4 billion after a 1.6 percent jump in October. The sales total reflects higher prices for gasoline in November as well as bigger volumes of business.</p>
