<p>The index of U.S. air cargo trade activity rose 2.4 percent to 507.1 in June after an even two percent May advance, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said.</p>
<p>In its latest Foreign Trade survey of air freight carriers, seaports and trucking firms, the bank said imports made the greatest contribution to the overall change, as has been the case all of this year to date.</p>
<p>The air cargo current-conditions import index rose 4.8 percent to 523.8 in June over May, while the bank said its export index showed no change for the second consecutive month, holding at 490.4.</p>
<p>&quot;Air cargo imports this June were particularly strong relative to past years, probably reflecting some high-tech shipments&quot; Michael Niemira, a Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi economist,told Reuters.</p>
<p>On the import side, the 4.8 percent gain in the current conditions index compared with a 4.1 percent May increase, a 3.0 percent advance in June 1996 and a 0.8 percent decline in the same 1995 month.</p>
<p>&quot;The market continues to be very strong,&quot; one North American based air cargo executive told the bank in its survey, summarizing the import business.</p>
<p>Commenting on the flat export trend, Niemira said &quot;it's a seasonally slow time.&quot;</p>
<p>The index (1989=100) is an equally-weighted composite index of current U.S. export and import air cargo activity that is not seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p>Among other categories of the bank's June trade survey, the index of future U.S. air cargo business fell 0.1 percent to 552.8.</p>
<p>The index for air cargo export business fell 0.7 percent to 599.8 in June from 604.0 in the prior month. On the same basis, the index for export expectations fell 0.9 percent to 654.5.</p>
<p>The air cargo import business index rose 2.2 percent to 456.3 in June from 446.6 in the prior month. The index for air cargo import expectations rose 1.3 percent to 451.1.</p>
<p>The relative export weakness in the basic monthly air cargo survey also was reflected in the bank's alternate presentation using not seasonally adjusted diffusion indexes.</p>
<p>The air cargo current conditions export diffusion index for June stood at an even 50 percent, which was weaker than the 1989-1996 period when the average June reading was 54 percent.</p>
<p>On the other hand the air cargo import diffusion index for June stood at 66.7 percent, its strongest June level since that survey component was first reported in 1989.</p>
