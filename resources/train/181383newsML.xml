<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan stocks end down as OTC market rallies.</title>
<headline>Taiwan stocks end down as OTC market rallies.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1996-11-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Taiwan share prices closed slightly lower on Monday as investors switched their trading to the rallying over-the-counter securities market, which has performed strongly in recent days, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index ended down 11.96 points or 0.18 percent at 6,571.12. Turnover was a modest T$36.03 billion.</p>
<p>The OTC market index and turnover have been hitting new record highs in the past week. &quot;The young OTC market, with many potential new shares, has attracted many investors, making them switch part of their money to the OTC market,&quot; said Michael Hung, head of research at Nikko Securities.  </p>
<p>Brokers also attributed the continued consolidation to foreign funds' stepping to the sidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign institutions have neared their period of closing books,&quot; Hung said. &quot;As the upside potential in the fourth quarter is seen limited, they prefer step to the sidelines.&quot;</p>
<p>Many brokers had predicted the index to reach up to 7,000 pionts in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Textiles fell most, followed by machinery, financial and plastic shares. Glass and transport shares rose. Constructions and asset-backed shares rose slightly, with BES Engineering up 40 cents to T$26.6.  </p>
<p>Electronic shares, which encountered profit-taking in early trade, closed slightly higher, with Mitac International up 50 cents to T$24.1.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected a consolidation phase to continue later this week, seeing a 6,520-6,600 range on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The market will be closed on Tuesday for a domestic holiday. It will reopen on Wednesday.</p>
