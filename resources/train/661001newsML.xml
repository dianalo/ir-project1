<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah steady in slow late trading.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah steady in slow late trading.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-06-13</dateline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was steady against the dollar in slow late trading on Friday.</p>
<p>One Japanese bank dealer said rupiah liquidity remained steady in the afternoon, with overnight money hovering at nine percent despite weekly tax payments.</p>
<p>Dealers said initial concerns of possible tightening did not materialise, causing the rupiah to soften slighly. Spot rupiah was at 2,428.4/28.7 at 0915 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,426.75/27.75.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said there was some short-covering in dollars due to the weekend factor.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,428.1/28.4 and 2,426.0/26.5, respectively.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was at 1.0/1.1 and tom/next at 0.26/0.30.</p>
<p>Dealers said longer-term swaps were stable after easing in the morning on ample rupiah supply.</p>
<p>Another U.S. bank dealer said offshore operators continued to hold long rupiah in the forward market, but reduced some positions when they took profit in the relatively ample market.</p>
<p>&quot;But I think they still tend to remain long in forwards,&quot; the dealer said, adding the market was still vulnerable to spillover from rumours of swap restrictions in other centres.  </p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 12.20/12.50, two at 25.50/26.25, three at 38.5/39.5 and six at 79.0/80.0 points.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its intervention band at 2,421/2,613 and its conversion band at 2,421/2,469 on Friday.</p>
<p>-- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364  </p>
<p>Dealers said, however, there was no spillover on Friday after the Jakarta swap market was jolted briefly late on Thursday following rumours of swap restrictions in Malaysia.</p>
<p>There were rumours in Malaysia that Bank Negara would adopt the same sort of foreign exchange controls as in Thailand. The talk started when the central bank called for a meeting on Friday with chief executive officers of some banks.</p>
<p>Banking sources, however, said Bank Negara was meeting the bankers to discuss routine foreign exchange activities.</p>
