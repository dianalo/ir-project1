<title>VATICAN: Armenian Church leader visits Pope.</title>
<headline>Armenian Church leader visits Pope.</headline>

<text>
<p>Pope John Paul on Wednesday welcomed to the Vatican His Holiness Karekin I, spiritual leader of the world's some six million Armenian Christians, who is on a five-day official visit.</p>
<p>Karekin's official title is His Holiness Karekin I Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians. He resides in Etchmiadzin, near the Armenian capital Yerevan.</p>
<p>The two -- the Pope wearing his traditional white cassock and the bearded Karekin wearing a hooded black robe -- sat side by side on identical thrones during the Pontiff's general audience.</p>
<p>The Armenian Church is one of the so-called Ancient Churches of the East which split away from Byzantine Christianity before the Great Schism of 1054, which divided the Eastern and Western Churches.</p>
<p>The Pope told the crowd in the Vatican's audience hall that he hoped the two Churches could eventually reach full unity.</p>
<p>Karekin said he was praying for the 76-year-old Pope's good health, &quot;not only for the good of the Roman Catholic Church but for that of all humanity&quot;.</p>
<p>The Armenian Church is an independent Christian Church introduced to Armenia by the apostles Jude and Bartholomew. In 301 A.D. Armenia became the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion.</p>
<p>The Armenian Church has various patriarchates around the world and members in the countries of the former Soviet Union, North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and Asia.</p>
