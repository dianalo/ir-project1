<p>Sepracor Inc said Wednesday that a study it conducted for norastemizole indicated that at all dose levels, the allergy drug had &quot;excellent&quot; potency, was well tolerated and showed no cardiac side-effects.</p>
<p>Norastemizole is an active metabolite of astemizole, marketed as Hismanal by Johnson &amp; Johnson.  </p>
<p>&quot;These findings strengthen our belief that norastemizole has the potential to be 'best of class' among third-generation nonsedating antihistamines and to become an over-the-counter drug,&quot; said Timothy Barberich, Sepracor's president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Sepracor said its dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study involved 48 subjects who were orally administered placebo or 25, 50 or 100 milligrams of norastemizole.</p>
<p>It said wheal and flair, an induced allergic reaction, was measured in all subjects after periodic injections of histamine.  </p>
<p>In participants receiving norastemizole, a positive antihistaminic response was seen within 30 minutes of dosing, it said.  The response lasted up to 24 hours and reached 100 percent in most subjects, it said.</p>
<p>It intends to initiate a Phase II efficacy study during this spring allergy season, it said.</p>
<p>Norastemizole is a complement to Sepracor's asthma product line, which includes levalbuterol and (R,R)-formoterol.</p>
<p>It said it plans to submit its first levalbuterol New Drug Application in June 1997.  It then plans to market the levalbuterol product line, followed by norastemizole, through its own sales force, it said.</p>
<p>In addition to levalbuterol and norastemizole, Sepracor is developing its rapid-onset, long-acting bronchodilator, (R,R)- formoterol, for asthma.</p>
