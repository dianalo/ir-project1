<p>Human rights activists on Tuesday accused the West of not doing enough to protect human rights in ex-Soviet states, saying Western countries should not support governments responsible for abuses.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1996 human rights principles were subordinated to current political and economic interests,&quot; said Alexander Petrov, Moscow representative of the U.S.-based rights monitor Human Rights Watch/Helsinki.</p>
<p>&quot;This particularly concerned the United States and the countries of the European Union,&quot; he told a news conference to mark International Human Rights Day.</p>
<p>&quot;An example of this kind of policy was provided by Russia's accession to the Council of Europe despite the renewal and continuation of intense military activity in Chechnya involving colossal violations of humanitarian law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Council of Europe, which sees itself as an arbiter of human rights, accepted Russia in February after months of delay due to concerns over Moscow's campaign in the breakaway region.</p>
<p>Council members said at the time that having Russia on board would help it to push forward human rights, but critics charged that it did nothing to stop the Chechnya fighting, which killed tens of thousands before a peace deal was signed in August.</p>
<p>&quot;Things were no better in other republics,&quot; Petrov said, citing aid given to Armenia and Georgia despite government crackdowns on opposition groups.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan had also conducted a campaign to crush dissent, he said, but nevertheless won observer status in the Council of Europe. Kazakhstan and Kirgizia also got Western support.</p>
<p>As far as the rights situation itself was concerned, Petrov said autocratic and arbitrary rule in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan made them the biggest causes for alarm.</p>
<p>In Russia, Petrov said the only significant improvement was the end to the conflict against separatist rebels in Chechnya, begun when President Boris Yeltsin sent in troops two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;If you set this aside human rights stayed on the same level and in some cases worsened,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the situation in Russia's regions was worse than in Moscow and other big towns, citing direct threats and financial sanctions which he said were used to gag the media. &quot;There is no progress, but a regression here.&quot;</p>
<p>Petrov also pinpointed a growth in xenophobia in Russia, particularly against people of Caucasian origin beaten up and deported from big towns by the authorities.</p>
<p>Lyudmila Alekseyeva, president of the Moscow Helsinki Group, which fought for human rights under communism, said the group had previously been concerned mainly with political rights, but was now turning its attention to the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;After the end of the war in Chechnya the biggest violations of human rights are delays in wage payments and pensions.&quot;</p>
<p>She said that despite repeated promises, the government had shown itself unable to guarantee wage payments and so should give people the power to claim their pay from the directors of their enterprises via the courts.</p>
<p>&quot;We will fight until it is resolved,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm afraid it will take a long time.&quot;</p>
