<title>JAPAN: INSTANT VIEW - Japan March current account surplus.</title>

<p>The surplus in Japan's current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, fell 17.0 percent to 1.03 trillion yen in March from a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The following are analysts' comments on the data.</p>
<p>ROBERT FELDMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SALOMON BROTHERS ASIA:</p>
<p>&quot;These numbers are very much in line with what we already know. On the capital account side, these are fiscal year-end numbers and so their meaning is limited. I don't believe they will accelerate moves in the currency market. I think people will be much more focused on the trade data to come out on Monday. We could have a doubling of the seasonally adjusted trade surplus in April. Today's data is of limited significance.&quot;  </p>
<p>JANE BERRYMAN, TECHNICAL DATA</p>
<p>&quot;It's come in fully in line with what has been forecast. I expect that the JGBs (Japanese government bonds) would be fairly relaxed about these figures but keep in mind that we are still waiting for the sexiest part of the report which is where the foreign bond holdings went.&quot;  </p>
<p>KAZUHIKO OGATA, JARDINE FLEMING SECURITIES</p>
<p>&quot;The March surplus recorded such a large drop because of a large rise in imports. However from April, the consumer spending rush effect will have gone and instead we can expect both exports of cars and semiconductors to increase in terms of volume. Combined with the fact that the surplus will not be helped by the weaker yen in April, it can be expected to rise considerably. The March fall can be seen as arising from special factors really.&quot;  </p>
<p>SUSUMU KATO, BZW SECURITIES</p>
<p>&quot;After April, the rise in the sales tax will mean domestic demand will fall and exports will jump as manufacturers shift their attention overseas. Also, weaker domestic demand will mean less imports and energy imports will also fall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thus the trade surplus is going to increase in the April-June quarter and the export drive that the U.S. has foreseen will happen and as such (trade) problems will emerge. The government seems to be saying that a rate of 115 to 120 yen to the dollar is desirable but it will depend if the U.S agrees.&quot;</p>
