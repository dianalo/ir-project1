<p>Juventus defender Moreno Torricelli will probably be out of competitive soccer for the rest of the season after suffering a severe knee ligament injury in Sunday's 0-0 draw against Inter Milan, Italian newspapers reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He is due to have his right knee operated on next week.</p>
<p>Newspapers said he would probably be out for six or seven months and was unlikely to play a competitive match before the start of the new season next September -- a hard blow for Juventus as they seek to retain their European Cup crown and win the Italian league.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very serious handicap for us,&quot; Juventus coach Marcello Lippi said. &quot;But one of our secrets is the ability of our reserves to step in ready and willing just when we need them.&quot;</p>
<p>Torricelli said he hoped to learn from the example of team mates Atillio Lombardo and Antonio Conte, both of whom have recently recovered from serious injuries.</p>
<p>&quot;Conte told me that I've just got to be patient and keep believing and defeat the boredom of physiotherapy...by saying to myself that every day passed is one day closer to my comeback,&quot; he said.</p>
