<p>Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said on Wednesday that the Spanish economy grew at around three percent in spring 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;With all certainty we can say that Spain grew at around three percent (in terms of) economic activity in the spring of 1997,&quot; Montoro told a seminar in Madrid.</p>
<p>He added that this was fuelling substantial jobs growth.  </p>
<p>In the last quarter of 1996 Spanish gross domestic product grew 2.6 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Montoro added this sustained rate of growth is based on a very solid basis, with inflation and the public deficit declining.</p>
<p>The public administration budget deficit is expected to be at 3.0 percent of GDP in 1997, he said.</p>
<p>Montoro reiterated that the consumer price index will fall below two percent year-on-year to historic lows soon.</p>
<p>&quot;This is key to the convergence plan of the government which will allow a reduction in the deficit and cuts in taxes&quot;.</p>
<p>He also reiterated that Spain is one of the strongest candidates for European Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
