<p>Palestinians in Arab East Jerusalem opened a shopping festival on Saturday to encourage commercial and cultural nightlife in an area suffering under Israeli security measures.</p>
<p>Palestinian merchants hoped the event would spark commercial activity in East Jerusalem, which has been cut off from the Gaza Strip and other parts of the West Bank by a protracted Israeli closures.</p>
<p>&quot;This festival is to confront the Israeli plan of isolating Arab Jerusalem, its economic resources from the rest of the West Bank,&quot; Hassib Nashashibi, a festival committee member, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It's important to break the Israeli siege and reactivate commercial movement which has been handicapped by this siege,&quot; Hassib said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people gathered for the opening ceremony at one of the Old City's gates where a Palestinian official spoke and a popular Arab singer, Reem Banna, broke the usual silence of the city's muted evenings.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Shopping Festival is offering discounts in local shops and on hotel rooms to encourage participation. The festival has also introduced daily walking tours of the Old City and has scheduled concerts.</p>
<p>Festival organisers said they want to fill what have become empty streets by sunset and hope to do so by keeping shops open and bringing in entertainment.</p>
<p>Israel imposed a closure on Gaza and most of the West Bank about three years ago for security reasons, making it difficult for most Palestinians to frequent shops in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israel occupied East Jerusalem after the 1967 Middle East war and claimed the whole city as its capital. The claim is not recognised internationally. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.</p>
<p>&quot;We've asked Palestinians in Israel to come to the festival and they have come, so if Israel aims to empty Jerusalem of its Arab residents and destroy its economy by the closure in order to Judaise it, it won't happen,&quot; said another organiser, who did not want to be identified.</p>
<p>On the opening night popular Arab singer from Tunis, Lutfi Bushnaq, performed a concert in one of the city's archaeological sites. Other groups from Algeria and Morocco are scheduled to perform during the two-week festival.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first step in a long-term programme to support the steadfastness of the (Palestinian) people of Jerusalem,&quot; said Palestinian official Faisal Husseini.</p>
