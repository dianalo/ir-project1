<headline>Pakistan says reporter held for &quot;anti-state&quot; acts.</headline>

<p>The Pakistani government on Tuesday acknowledged the detention of a local journalist held incommunicado for four days and said the man had been accused of &quot;anti-state activities&quot;.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Shujaat Hussain told parliament that Humayun Far, Islamabad bureau chief of the Urdu-language daily Mashriq, had not appeared before a magistrate to be remanded in custody because he had been arrested under the Army Act.</p>
<p>Reporters briefly boycotted parliamentary proceedings on Monday in protest against government silence over Far's seizure by unidentified men near his Islamabad home on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The official APP news agency quoted Hussain as telling the National Assembly (lower house) on Tuesday he needed two more days to make a comprehensive statement, but he said Far had been &quot;apprehended on charges of anti-state activities&quot;.</p>
<p>He said Far had been detained after a person already under investigation for anti-state activities told authorities that he had been receiving secret documents from the journalist &quot;for onward delivery to other people&quot;.</p>
<p>The Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists said on Sunday a state agency had picked up Far in what it called an attack on press freedom.</p>
