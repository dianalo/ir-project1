<text>
<p>London's white sugar futures market got off to a flying start on Monday with solid early volume posted in the August/October spread.</p>
<p>Price movements were tight but traders said they were encouraged by the level of activity, although they added that the focus of attention would be on New York after its aggressive fund-led rally on Friday.</p>
<p>In London, August/October accounted for nearly all the morning's volume although some flat-price buying was also noted.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been a few crosses but it's pretty much genuine volume,&quot; said one trader, citing a mixed bag of players. Most of these were French, he said.</p>
<p>At 1125 GMT August was up 80 cents at $310.00, down from its Friday's peak of $312.50 which will now act as nearby resistance. October was down 20 cents at $304.50.</p>
<p>Volume was dominated by the two front months and totalled 639 lots.</p>
<p>Market sources said the New York market was expected to firm further in a continuation of Friday's strength but sellers who were absent during the rally might then emerge and cap the gains.</p>
<p>Trading was very quiet in Paris with just 25 lots of spot August posted on the board. The position was unchanged at $310.00, the same as its London equivalent.</p>
