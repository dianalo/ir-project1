<p>The independent prosecutor investigating allegations of misconduct by former Clinton Administration Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy on Thursday defended the nearly three-year-long probe and said he would complete it &quot;fairly, vigorously and expeditiously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This investigation is in fact about big business and powerful individuals illegally buying and attempting to buy access to a member of the president's cabinet who regulates their industry,&quot; said Donald Smaltz, who was appointed independent counsel in August 1994 to investigate Espy.</p>
<p>Smaltz issued a statement responding to a story in the June 16 issue of Time magazine, which said the probe has cost taxpayers more than $9 million with little to show for it.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a federal judge granted a new trial to convicted Tyson Foods lobbyist Jack Williams after Smaltz's prosecutors failed to tell Williams' lawyers that a key FBI witness had admitted lying under oath in an unrelated matter.</p>
<p>In March, another federal judge dismissed Smaltz's case against Espy's brother because of lack of evidence to show Henry Espy had defrauded election officials when running for Mike Espy's former congressional seat.</p>
<p>But Smaltz said the magazine did not mention his team's criminal convictions of three corporations, five individuals and one law firm, plus the collection of more than $3.5 million in fines. The convictions are related to gifts given to Espy or his brother to win access and influence decisions, he said.</p>
<p>The Time magazine story said Smaltz was expected to complete his investigation this summer with possible indictments against Espy and Tyson Foods.</p>
<p>&quot;Notwithstanding Time's unfounded criticism and efforts to trivialize this investigation even before its conclusion, I will continue to perform the duties for which I was appointed fairly, vigorously and expeditiously,&quot; Smaltz said.</p>
