<headline>Calif hearing held on Chrysler suspension proposal.</headline>
<dateline>SACRAMENTO, Calif. 1996-08-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>An administrative law judge in California heard testimony on Tuesday on a proposal to suspend deliveries of Chrysler Corp vehicles for two months in the state, a California Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman said.</p>
<p>The judge heard testimony in Sacramento on the potential economic impact of the proposed suspension to dealers, consumers and local governments. Three dealers were to testify in hearings expected to last through Wednesday, state Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman William Gengler said.  </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the administrative law judge found that Chrysler violated the state Lemon Law 116 times by re-selling repaired cars and trucks without proper documentation.</p>
<p>Violations included failing to notify used car buyers of the status of the vehicles sold and failing to provide warranties. The vehicles in question were sold in 1992.</p>
<p>In late May, the state Department of Motor Vehicles asked the judge to review the impact of the proposed 60-day suspension. Under the proposal, Chrysler would be prohibited from delivering vehicles to dealers for 60 days and the company would be on probation for three years.  </p>
<p>In response, Chrysler vowed to continue selling vehicles in California, saying it would either settle alleged violations of the Lemon Law or prevail in the appeal process.</p>
<p>California authorities said they have been investigating the Chrysler matter for more than two years and stand by the allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;Action should definitely be taken against Chrysler because of the extent of the violations in California,&quot; Gengler said. &quot;However, we sent the proposed decision back to the judge because we were concerned about the economic impacts it would have on innocent third parties.&quot;  </p>
<p>During the review period, no action was to be taken against Chrysler, Gengler said.</p>
<p>When the hearings are completed, the judge is expected to reaffirm or modify his earlier decision. Afterwards, the Department of Motor Vehicles could accept, modify or reject the proposal.</p>
<p>If accepted, Chrysler would be able to take the case to the New Motor Vehicle Board or appeal to a higher state court, Gengler said.</p>
