<headline>LVMH, GrandMet, Guinness meeting useful - analysts.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-07-02</dateline>

<p>The chairmen of LVMH, Guinness and Grand Metropolitan appear to have left the door open for a three-way deal after meeting in Paris on Wednesday, analysts said.</p>
<p>But they said LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault needs to prove that his proposal to create an independent, listed company combining the three groups' drinks businesses would create more shareholder value than the planned Guinness-Grand Met merger in order to arrive at a peaceable agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;They've left the door open for a three-way deal,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;The British ... have gone so far as to say publicly that they are open to Bernard Arnault's proposals,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>But analysts said they did not see an imminent breakthrough and uncertainty would weigh on the share prices. &quot;LVMH stock is going to continue in this yo-yo pattern,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Guinness chairman Tony Greener and Grand Met chairman George Bull said in a joint statement that the meeting provided a &quot;useful opportunity&quot; to hear Arnault's views first-hand.</p>
<p>They said they were &quot;open to any proposals provided that they create additional value for our shareholders ... and that this is fairly shared between them.&quot; They asked Arnault to detail his proposals in writing and said he had agreed.</p>
<p>Arnault, the largest single shareholder in Guinness and Grand Met, said his plan would &quot;create significantly greater value for the shareholders of the three companies than the merger proposed by Guinness and Grand Met, both in terms of potential synergies and market valuation of a coherent company with a portfolio of prestige brands.&quot;</p>
<p>One analyst said such a deal would be beneficial for LVMH's results. &quot;Not by a lot in the short term, but it would be interesting in the longer term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But another analyst said, &quot;My very rough estimates suggest it would not be enhancing for Guinness and Grand Met shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>The one-hour meeting of the three chairmen in Paris followed an assault by Arnault on the British companies to drive home his opposition to their planned 24 billion pound merger announced in May.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks LVMH has spent more than eight billion francs to buy 6.4 percent of Grand Met in an apparent bid to line up votes to block the merger.</p>
<p>LVMH had previously taken legal action against Guinness, in which it holds 14.2 percent, to force the company to shed its stakes in their valuable joint distribution ventures. Those ventures hold the rights for 10 years to market Guinness brands in France, the United States and much of the Far East.</p>
