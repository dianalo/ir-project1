<p>The OECD, offering Moscow a closer partnership but no firm date for joining the international free-market organisation, forged a new co-operation pact with Russia on Tuesday and vowed to help it liberalise its economy.</p>
<p>Ministers from the 29 member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development signed a deal with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov calling for new liaison ties to monitor the transition from Soviet-era planning to a durable free-market system.</p>
<p>An OECD statement released after a brief signing ceremony pledged to &quot;assist the Russian Federation in its progress to establishing a fully fledged market economy within a framework of democratic institutions&quot;.</p>
<p>It also promised to &quot;help the Russian Federation to meet and sustain all the conditions for membership of the OECD,&quot; without putting down a target date for membership.</p>
<p>The deal, signed under the shadow of a NATO-Russia summit a few miles way, takes Moscow a step closer to joining the body set up 50 years ago to help western Europe onto its feet after World War II. The OECD has already embraced former Soviet bloc states such as Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland.</p>
<p>Russia surprised the OECD with a formal membership bid at the group's last ministerial meeting exactly a year ago.</p>
<p>But while the OECD has accepted the principle of welcoming Russia in, membership looks some way off as Moscow slowly adapts to the group's free-market ideology, diplomats said.</p>
<p>&quot;For the moment there's a clear shortfall in Russia's economic performance. No one has put a date on membership yet,&quot; said a European diplomat close to the new liaison talks.</p>
<p>Donald Johnston, the Canadian Secretary General of the OECD, said in advance of the two-day annual OECD summit here on Monday and Tuesday that Russian membership was the &quot;shared goal&quot; in the long term but that Moscow had a very long way to go on economic liberalisation before formal entry talks could even start.</p>
<p>The OECD has already had some form of co-operation with Russia since 1990, as part of its mandate to help economies in transition. The two sides also signed a declaration on co-operation on June 8, 1994, opening up a policy dialogue.</p>
<p>The new framework calls for two high-level meetings yearly, one of these at ministerial level, Johnston said in advance of Tuesday's signing.</p>
<p>Primakov was in Paris with President Boris Yeltsin who met U.S. President Bill Clinton to sign a landmark security pact between Russia and NATO.</p>
<p>The OECD's membership profile has changed dramatically in the past few years as it has opened its doors to less wealthy countries like Mexico, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland and also spread its wings in Asia beyond Japan to include most recently South Korea.</p>
