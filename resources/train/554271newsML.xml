<p>ING Barings the investment banking arm of Dutch financial giant ING, would do well to buy the remaining 75 percent of U.S. investment bank Dillon Read &amp; Co it does not already own, banking analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a very logical and attractive acquisition for them,&quot; Matthew Czepliewicz, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Earlier, ING spokesman Ruud Polet confirmed ING Barings, formed when ING rescued British bank Barings in 1995, was talking to Dillon Read about buying it.</p>
<p>&quot;If the conditions are right for both parties, it would be nice to have it all,&quot; Ruud Polet said. ING Barings already owns 25 percent of the privately-owned group, but Dillon Read partners have an option to buy back the stake before the end of June.</p>
<p>Banking sources said the partners had an option on the stake at book value but had been in talks with ING group's chairman of corporate and investment banking about selling the business to ING Barings.</p>
<p>ING chief executive Aad Jacobs, who earlier this year said the group had the capacity to buy both an insurance company and a bank, is also believed to have been involved in the talks.</p>
<p>These have been going on for some time and have been held in both London and New York.</p>
<p>Jacobs' strategy meant that ING was &quot;not in the mood to splash out on a 'bulge bracket' firm&quot;, Salomon Brothers' Czepliewicz said. But Dillon Read would fit nicely with ING Barings' existing U.S. operations and have little downside.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a low-risk, low-cost acquisition in the U.S., which has a compelling industrial argument for them,&quot; Czepliewicz said. &quot;But it is not going to make them a bulge bracket player,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>ING acknowledged that talks with Dillon Read were mainly about price but also dealt with other issues although Polet declined to comment on a newspaper report which said ING Barings would buy the rest of the Wall Street firm for $425-$450 million.</p>
<p>One banking source described the negotiations as a poker game, with Dillon Read partners in an apparently strong position given their option to become fully independent and the current interest among foreign and U.S. banks.</p>
<p>While ING -- along with most European investment banks -- wants to build up its presence on Wall Street, Jacobs is expected to be wary of building up too large a dependence on investment banking.</p>
<p>Analysts said he would opt for a consistent balance of earnings based on life assurance and traditional banking, without too great an exposure to the more volatile world of investment banking.</p>
<p>But the group's desire for both a U.S. life assurance firm and a European bank or investment banking operation could ultimately prove difficult.</p>
<p>A lack of potential targets in Europe, and the problems surrounding some of them, could hurt ING's share price if it did not step carefully.</p>
<p>If ING did succeed in gaining control of Dillon Read, banking sources said the relationship -- which Polet said is currently good -- would be made easier because of the six year history shared by the two.</p>
<p>&quot;It is like a long engagement before a marriage,&quot; said one source, adding that the relationship between the two had been close enough to know that the cultures would mix.</p>
<p>ING Barings currently employs around 1,200 people in its New York operation and concentrates on global high- yield business, emerging markets and banking.</p>
