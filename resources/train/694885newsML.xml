<p>A middle-aged man murdered his four children and then killed himself in an apparent murder-suicide in the Australian island state of Tasmania, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Inspector John Warren said police were called to a house in Cambridge about 15 km (10 miles) east of the capital Hobart on Sunday morning and found the bodies of four children inside a sandstone cottage.</p>
<p>Police said they found the body of a middle-aged man outside an adjacent carpentry workshop. The man appeared to have killed himself after the murders, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand a gun was involved and also another weapon,&quot; Inspector Warren told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.</p>
<p>Further details were not immediately available.</p>
<p>The murder scene was about 50 km north of Port Arthur, where gunman Martin Bryant used now-banned semi-automatic rifles to murder 35 people in April last year in what was Australia's worst modern-day massacre.</p>
