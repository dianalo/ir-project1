<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-BUCKS BEAT CELTICS.</headline>
<dateline>BOSTON 1996-12-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Vin Baker had 28 points and 11 rebounds and triggered a key third-quarter burst as the Milwaukee Bucks pounded the Boston Celtics, 107-91 for the third time this season on Monday.</p>
<p>Glenn Robinson added 19 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for the Bucks, who held a 58-36 rebounding advantage and gave coach Chris Ford a win in his return to Boston. Ford coached the Celtics for five years before Milwaukee.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got a good team that is playing well,&quot; Ford said. &quot;Vin and Glenn Robinson were able to post up and get easy scoring opportunities.  We have a good, unselfish team that makes the extra pass.&quot;</p>
<p>Allen scored 16 points and Andrew Lang added 12.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Grant Hill had 27 points and 12 rebounds and Joe Dumars added 21 points as the Detroit Pistons handed the Toronto Raptors their fourth straight loss, 98-92.</p>
<p>Otis Thorpe had 14 points and 11 rebounds for Detroit, which held Toronto, osers of six of thier last eight games, scoreless for the final four minutes. The Pistons have won seven of their last eight games.</p>
<p>&quot;That team is tough to play against,&quot; said Detroit coach Doug Collins. &quot;They scramble the floor, they're very athletic. They do a good job of trapping and they basically don't let you run your offence.</p>
<p>In Sacramento, Chris Webber continued his strong play with 24 points and 14 rebounds, leading the Washington Bullets to a 97-89 victory over the shorthanded Sacramento Kings.</p>
<p>Webber is averaging 23.1 points and 11.5 rebounds over his last six games for Washington.</p>
<p>Juwan Howard added 21 points and grabbed eight rebounds while Rod Strickland had 17 points and eight assists for the Bullets.</p>
<p>Mitch Richmond led Sacramento with 28 points.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Brent Barry sank a tying three-pointer with one second left in regulation and Terry Dehere scored four straight points in overtime to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 122-121 victory over the Phoenix Suns at the Pond in Anaheim.</p>
<p>Kevin Johnson made two free throws with three seconds left in the fourth quarter to give the Suns a 113-110 lead. After a timeout, Barry took the inbounds pass, dribbled behind the three-point line in the right corner and sent the game into overtime.</p>
<p>Malik Sealy scored 28 points before fouling out in overtime for the Clippers.</p>
<p>Manning scored 24 points and John Williams and Michael Finly contributed 17 apiece for the Suns.</p>
