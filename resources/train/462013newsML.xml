<p>African peacekeepers exchanged fire with army mutineers and their supporters for a second successive day in Central African Republic's capital on Sunday, residents said. They put the Saturday death toll at up to five.</p>
<p>The clashes were the most serious since President Ange-Felix Patasse and his rivals agreed an African-mediated peace plan in January to end the country's third army mutiny in under a year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the mutineers, meanwhile, rejected a plan by the president and peacekeepers to disarm the mutineers, saying that this was not part of the accords and that they wanted to return to barracks in honour and dignity.</p>
<p>&quot;Any operation to disarm the former mutineers will be an act of war,&quot; Lieutenant Parfait Mbaye told Reuters by telephone. He said the peace accords were not being respected.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the multinational peacekeeping force MISAB confirmed that three mutineers were killed in a clash at a petrol station on Saturday and several were wounded.</p>
<p>Residents said two civilians were reported killed in crossfire but that their deaths remained to be confirmed.</p>
<p>They said there were fresh exchanges of fire on Sunday.</p>
<p>The first mutinies last April and May began over pay and conditions but turned into a campaign to oust Patasse, a northern civilian who won 1993 presidential elections.</p>
<p>The latest mutiny, which began in November, degenerated into ethnic bloodshed. French troops, in the country under a defence pact, restored order.</p>
<p>Witnesses said mutineers and their supporters had set up barricades over the weekend in their strongholds in the southern suburbs by the broad River Oubangui, which borders Zaire.</p>
<p>In the western suburb of Ouango, another stronghold of the mutineers near the main Kassai barracks, protesters on Saturday blocked a team led by Malian mediator Amadou Toumani Toure.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they let Toumani Toure and two members of his team through for talks with former military ruler Andre Kolingba, who lives in the area and belongs to the same minority Yakoma tribe as the mutineers.</p>
<p>The peacekeepers, who include soldiers from Mali, Gabon, Chad, Burkina Faso, Togo and Senegal, took over from French troops last month to act as a buffer between the rival forces.</p>
<p>MISAB's commander General Nkili Edjo said in a statement on Saturday that the peacekeepers had acted in self-defence and stressed the neutrality of the force.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Chadian peacekeepers were involved in Saturday's clash.</p>
<p>Critics of Patasse have accused him of hiring Chadian mercenaries in the past. Mbaye said the Chadians were trying to lay down the law. &quot;There's no question of that,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Patasse formed a government of national unity under the peace deal but his supporters hold the main portfolios. Friction has continued between Patasse and the mutineers.</p>
<p>On March 15, Patasse decreed an amnesty for all involved in the revolts but it gave mutineers until March 30 to hand over their weapons or fail to qualify.</p>
