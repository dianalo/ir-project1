<title>USA: U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS - prices slip with Treasuries.</title>
<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS - prices slip with Treasuries.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-04</dateline>

<p>U.S. municipal bond prices turned down from 3/8 to 3/4 of a point in late trade on Wednesday, tracking softer Treasury bonds, though traders said bid-wanted lists also exerted a bit of pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of customers selling today, and a lot more bonds showed up in the marketplace,&quot; a trader said.  </p>
<p>Bid-wanted lists were estimated at from $300 million to $400 million, and traders said there was sizable two-way flow, as institutions, who mostly appeared to be trying to sell long bonds, were willing to do business on a cash instead of a swap basis.</p>
<p>In contrast to municipal debt sold on Tuesday, several of the offerings brought to the market on Wednesday were repriced with higher yields.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess people were scared deals wouldn't get done, so why not price them a little cheap?&quot; a trader said, explaining the shift in the market's psychology.  </p>
<p>For example, First Albany said it repriced and restrucutred New Hampshire's $64.1 million general obligation bond issue, raising yields in several maturities but leaving the top yield in 2016 unchanged at 5.35 percent.</p>
<p>And PaineWebber said it repriced Saint Luke's/Shawnee Mission Health System, Kan's $77.2 million bond issue, raising yields in several maturities but leaving the top yield in 2026 unchanged at 5.582 percent.</p>
<p>While the New York State Dormitory Authority restructured a $252 million sale of revenue bonds, the top yield was unchanged at 5.53 percent in 2015.  </p>
<p>U.S. March Treasury bond futures, disappointed that the Federal Reserve did not buy coupons as many players had expected, slipped 21 ticks to 115-11/32. But the March municipal bond futures outperformed, only falling 11 ticks to 117-10/32.</p>
<p>As a result, the MOB spread between the two futures contracts fattened 10 ticks from levels seen on Tuesday to plus 63 ticks.</p>
<p>Actively traded issues included Metropolitan Pier &amp; Exposition Authority Illinois Dedicated State Tax Revenue Refundings of June 2027, which pay a 5-1/4 percent coupon, and were bid at 5.58 percent NET, up three basis points.</p>
<p>And Alabama Water Pollution Control Authority Revolving Fund Loan of August 2020, which have a 5-1/2 percent coupon, were offered at 5.60 percent NET, down three basis points.</p>
