<p>Northern Portugal, the country's economic base, is feeling the unaccustomed chill of unemployment as traditional businesses battle to survive in an increasingly competitive trading world.</p>
<p>While national economic debate focuses on whether Portugal will make the starting grid for Europe's single currency, businessmen and economists say that it is rapid moves to global free trade that are posing the greatest challenge.</p>
<p>Small textile, clothing and shoe manufacturers, which earlier this decade employed more than half the region's work force, face a mounting threat from cheaper goods from Asia and parts of Africa flooding into Europe under international accords freeing up the flow of world commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;The great challenge to Portugal is not the single currency but trade. We have still not totally adapted to liberalisation,&quot; said economist Manuel Martins of the Oporto Industrial Association (AIP).</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot continue to produce the same sort of products that the Far East produces more cheaply than we do,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>PORTUGAL LOST ITS PRICE ADVANTAGE</p>
<p>Portugal, still one of the European Union's poorest members despite making economic strides since joining the bloc a decade ago, could once rely on the relative cheapness of its labour force and import barriers to nurture industries ranging from textiles to tinned foods.</p>
<p>Now with barriers disappearing and price gradually ceasing to be an advantage, industries will survive only if they can compete with Europe's best in terms of quality, speed of delivery and flexibility, businessmen say.</p>
<p>But while confident that the transformation will be achieved, the cost in the short-run in terms of unemployment could be high, they warn.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no tradition of this (high unemployment). Above all in Oporto, where the level of unemployment is one of the highest in Portugal -- 11.4 percent,&quot; said the mayor Fernando Gomes.</p>
<p>The rate compares with around seven percent nationwide and could even underestimate the problem because many of those who lose their jobs in industry return to the land to subsistence farms and disappear from the statistics, economists say.</p>
<p>&quot;There are companies which already know how to deal with the global market. But there are others which are still inward looking, too preoccupied with the internal market,&quot; said Henry Tillo, president of the Portuguese Textile and Clothing Association.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is our conviction that within two or three years -- by the millennium -- the worst will be over,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>PORTUGAL TO FIGHT ANY SPEEDING OF LIBERALISTION</p>
<p>This assumes, however, that European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is thwarted in his desire to speed up the dismantling of remaining barriers to trade in textiles which are not due to come down fully until 2004.</p>
<p>Portugal will certainly fight any such attempt, industrialists said.</p>
<p>&quot;If it (the existing framework) is respected then we are not afraid...(but) I think that Brittan is trying to liberalise too much,&quot; said Trillo.</p>
<p>While Portugal's clothing industry may not yet be causing Italy's doyens of design any sleepless nights, there are no doubts that the business is on the right track, economists say.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen years ago, most of our clothing production was designed abroad, made at the orders of international clients. But now we are increasingly doing the designing ourselves,&quot; said the AIP's Martins.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, for example, Oporto has been the setting for fashion shows, drawing top models such as Claudia Schiffer.</p>
<p>Rising living standards are slowly narrowing the wages gap with the rest of Europe, so lifting production costs, but Portugal still enjoys an important geographic advantage over Far Eastern competitors.</p>
<p>In a business world increasingly demanding flexibility and fast delivery, Portugal's closeness to its main customers in northern Europe remains an important weapon in the battle for markets, industrialists say.</p>
<p>SHOES -- A SUCCESS STORY</p>
<p>In one area of the clothing business, the Portuguese can already point to notable success, with its shoe industry mounting a challenge to Italy's European dominance in quality if not in quantity, industry leaders say.</p>
<p>Portugal's footwear industry is worth more than $2 billion a year with over 80 percent of its output going to export.</p>
<p>But when it comes to competing with the Italians, the country still has a serious obstacle to overcome -- its image, industrialists say.</p>
<p>&quot;Portugal's image is one of a peripheral, poor country, while a consumer only has to see an Italian type name to think of quality. That is our biggest problem,&quot; said Manuel Carlos, president of the Portuguese Shoe Association.</p>
<p>Another could be currency.</p>
<p>When European Union leaders meet early next year to decide which countries have passed the economic entry tests for economic and monetary union -- the single currency -- Portugal's shoe manufacturers will be praying Italy ranks amongst them.</p>
<p>Their businesses were nearly ruined in the early 1990s when a massive devaluation of the lira left Portugal unable to match the Italians even in price.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our feeling that Italy cannot remain outside...and if it did, there would have to be an accord on devaluations,&quot; said Carlos.</p>
