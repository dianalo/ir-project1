<p>Poor Italian car sales data for November and specially a fall in the Fiat group's market share show the domestic market needs more than just stop-gap measures to boost flagging sales, a regional leader of the Italian FIOM metalworkers' union said.</p>
<p>The data showed the Turin-based carmaker had problems with competitiveness &quot;which can't be tackled just with stop-gap measures to boost demand or, worse still, with recessive wage policies which ignore the efforts and professionality of workers,&quot; said Giorgio Cremaschi, FIOM secretary in the northwest Piedmont region where Fiat is based.</p>
<p>Italian metalworkers' unions are currently in deadlock with employers, including Fiat, in a dispute over wage contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;Extraordinary measures involving industrial policies are necessary when it comes down to it,&quot; Cremaschi said in a statement.</p>
<p>Unions and auto sector research groups have called for government incentives to revive flagging Italian car sales.</p>
<p>Transport ministry data on Tuesday showed Italian new car registrations in November fell 11.44 percent year-on-year with Fiat car group marques posting a 17.1 percent decline.</p>
<p>Fiat group's market share fell to 45.63 percent from 48.75 percent in November 1995.</p>
<p>Cremaschi said Fiat was losing out in terms of market share &quot;especially to products of companies whose employees are paid higher wages and have better working conditions.&quot;</p>
