<p>Blackburn Rovers, bottom of the English premier league without a win this season, have parted company with manager Ray Harford.</p>
<p>Harford, who resigned, had been under increasing pressure since taking over from Kenny Dalglish last season. He decided he could take no more following Tuesday's 1-0 home defeat by second division Stockport in the League Cup third round.</p>
<p>There was a demonstration against him by Blackburn fans, who in 1995 celebrated the club's winning of the championship under Dalglish.</p>
<p>Harford, who took over the managership after being coach under Dalglish, said: &quot;It was a big decision that's taken a lot of thought, but the performance and result against Stockport the other night was the final straw.&quot;</p>
<p>Blackburn chairman Robert Coar said: &quot;Ray has offered his resignation and that has been accepted by the board of Blackburn Rovers. We have negotiated a settlement with Ray in view of his five years stout, sterling and loyal service.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish him and his wife Maureen all the best for the future.&quot;</p>
