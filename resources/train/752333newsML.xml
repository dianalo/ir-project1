<p>South African stocks finished weaker on Thursday, unable to sustain Wednesday's bull run on the back of Wall Street without fresh local news from either government or the Reserve Bank, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers added that some profit-taking was seen as short-term players cashed in after the industrial index finished Wednesday at a new high of 9,032.3.</p>
<p>Some good buying was seen at these lower levels and dealers said institutions were accumulating stock.</p>
<p>Stock moved back into the local market in the form of basket selling from London professionals and this provided liquidity.</p>
<p>The local market was awaiting any news from either government or Reserve Bank to give it direction, dealers said.</p>
<p>Stocks were seen building support at these levels before testing upside again.</p>
<p>Industrials finished more or less flat while golds slipped to close weaker after the struggling bullion price eroded the ground from underneath them.</p>
<p>Overall volumes were hefty with more than a billion rands worth of shares traded on the day.</p>
<p>The Industrial index finished 6.0 points down at 9,026.3, golds fell 29.8 to 952.6 and all-shares were dragged 19.9 points down to 7,427 points.</p>
