<p>Japan and Australia pledged on Tuesday to strengthen their already-tight ties, promising fresh cooperation across a wide spectrum from security and the economy to culture and education.</p>
<p>But Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his Australian counterpart John Howard also agreed in talks that efforts in the potentially touchy area of defence should proceed &quot;step-by-step.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For my part, I see merit in allowing the relationship to evolve. I don't think that we should dramatically accelerate it, not should we have a kind of blind spot about it,&quot; Howard told a joint news conference after talks with Hashimoto.</p>
<p>Hashimoto echoed the sentiment: &quot;Rather than try to run ahead with new enterprises, I should like to make efforts to build a firm relationship of trust by proceeding step by step.&quot;</p>
<p>Hashimoto, who met U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday, said both Japan and Australia shared the view that the U.S. military presence in Asia was the &quot;most important factor&quot; for the stability of the region.</p>
<p>The two leaders -- who have agreed to meet at annual summits in future -- rejected any suggestion that a possible expansion in Australian training facilities for U.S. marines would be directly linked to a reduction of America's military presence on Japan's southern island of Okinawa, whose residents bitterly resent the concentration of U.S. forces there.</p>
<p>&quot;My understanding is that the offer (in a joint Australia- U.S. declaration last year) will not lead to any reduced U.S. presence in other areas of Asia,&quot; Hashimoto said.</p>
<p>The two leaders also agreed on the outline of an 18-point Japan-Australia Partnership Plan mandating expanded cooperation in bilateral, regional and global arenas. Details of the plan will be fleshed out at a bilateral ministerial meeting to be held in Tokyo on August 1.</p>
<p>Hashimoto reiterated Japan's support for Canberra's entry into the fledgling Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). Australia, embarrassed by its exclusion from ASEM -- which links 10 Asian nations with the 15 members of the European Union -- has been conducting a campaign to be accepted as a member in the face of opposition from Malaysia.</p>
<p>Hashimoto has been keen to extend bilateral cooperation to non-economic matters as well as to raise Tokyo's own political profile in the Asia-Pacific region -- although many Japanese remain ambivalent about the latter aim.</p>
<p>Hashimoto also brought Canberra a welcome gift in the form of Tokyo's agreement to buy some of the foreign rice it imports at at time more suitable for Australian rice growers, easing what Canberra had complained was a non-tarriff barrier to its rice exports to Japan.</p>
<p>Howard said he stressed his concern over U.S. and European efforts to set binding targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions at a global warming conference to be hosted by Japan in Kyoto in December.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a situation where atypically, Australia, as a developed exporter of energy, is particularly vulnerable if a consensus emerges around targets, which would be quite unacceptable to Australia,&quot; Howard said, adding tuch targets would also have a damaging impact on Japan.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said Japan understood Australia's position and had no desire to turn the Kyoto conference into a &quot;forum for confrontation,&quot; adding that Tokyo believed objectives imposed on states should be &quot;fair and feasible.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan is under particular pressure on the issue from the United States and Hashimoto heard some tough words on the topic from Vice President Al Gore in Washington, Japanese diplomatic sources said.</p>
<p>Hashimoto also said he conveyed to Howard his concern that Japanese car makers who produce in Australia might suffer from the further reduction of Canberra's car tariffs.</p>
<p>&quot;What I told the prime minister was, 'John, I trust you...&quot; Hashimoto said of the tariff cuts.</p>
<p>Hashimoto was to leave later on Tuesday afternoon for Wellington, where he was to meet Prime Minister Jim Bolger and other members of New Zealand's coalition cabinet installed last December.</p>
