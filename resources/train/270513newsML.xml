<p>The Belgian government approved a new economic plan on Friday aimed at slashing the country's budget deficit and whittling away its mountainous debts with the goal of joining the European Union's single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Under what Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt said was the most realistic of three scenarios set out in the convergence plan, the government aims to cut the deficit to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year from 3.4 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The deficit will fall further to 2.0 percent in 1998, 1.6 percent in 1999 and 1.6 percent of GDP again in the year 2000. The Maastricht Treaty target is a maximum of 3.0 percent.  </p>
<p>The convergence plan also sets its sights on reducing government debt to 127.0 percent of GDP in 1997 from 130.4 percent this year.</p>
<p>In 1998 the debt is predicted to fall to 124.1 percent, followed by a further decline to 122.0 percent the following year and 120.5 percent in the year 2000.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty sets the goal for debt at 60 percent of GDP, but includes an escape clause allowing amounts above that figure to be accepted as long at the percentage is declining at a &quot;satisfactory pace&quot;.  </p>
<p>Maystadt told news conference on the plan the main way the government was aiming to achieve the debt and deficit reductions was by raising the primary budget surplus and holding it at a high level.</p>
<p>To this end, he said, the convergence plan forecast the primary surplus would rise to 5.8 percent of GDP in 1997 from 5.4 percent this year.</p>
<p>It would rise again to 6.2 percent in 1998 and 6.3 percent in 1999 before ticking down to 6.1 percent in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Maystadt said the plan was based on prudent assumptions for economic growth and the impact of budget measures.  </p>
<p>Under the most optimistic of the three scenarios set out in the plan, which must be approved by European Union ministers, the deficit falls to 1.1 percent in the year 2000 and the debts are reduced to 117.8 percent.</p>
<p>The middle of the road scenario has the deficit down at 1.4 percent of GDP in the year 2000 and the debts at 120.4 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Belgium already fulfills most of the Maastricht convergence criteria; price stability, exchange rate stability, convergence of long-term interest rates...therefore the thrust of this document is on budgetary convergence,&quot; Maystadt said.  </p>
<p>He said that keeping the deficit down below two percent and, under the most ambitious scenario near one percent, would give the government ample leeway to ride out economic shocks into the next century without having to resort to emergency measures to keep below the three percent ceiling.</p>
<p>In that respect, he said, the convergence plan already resembled the budget stability plans that all countries joining the single currency in 1999 will have to produce.</p>
<p>Once in the single currency, countries breaching the three percent limit may face heavy fines.</p>
