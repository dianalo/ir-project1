<p>CME lumber futures showed little price movement before and after the January contract expired and prices ended light mixed in generally quiet dealings, traders said.</p>
<p>Futures closed $1.40 per thousand board feet lower to $0.50 higher with March off most at $410.30 and only May up at $382.50 per tbf. January expired earlier at $403.10, off $1.90 per tbf.</p>
<p>Carryover demand from Tuesday's sharp gains lacked follow-through demand and futures retreated following the weak undertone to cash lumber and the break in January ahead of its expiration, traders said.</p>
<p>Random Lengths quoted cash spruce at $400 per tbf, off $10 from Friday and week-ago levels. Cash sources also noted that wholesalers were selling wood under the quoted price.</p>
<p>But underlying support was evident in futures and prices drifted back from lows late. Expectations are that demand for wood will increase once the weather improves and dealers start to restock for the spring home building season, traders added.</p>
<p>January OSB expired up $2.00 at $134.00 per thousand square feet after setting a new contract low earlier of $131.50. Other months finished 1.50 to $1.90 higher.</p>
