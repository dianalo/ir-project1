<headline>JC Penney sees Eckerd deal modestly dilutive in 97.</headline>

<p>J.C. Penney Co Inc executives said they expect their $3.3 billion acquisition of Eckerd Corp to be modestly dilutive to earnings in 1997, but predicted significant synergies and said the deal would boost earnings per share from 1998 onwards.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to have some one-time costs,&quot; J.C. Penney Chief Financial Officer Don McKay told Reuters. &quot;It is likely the deal will close in the first quarter of 1997 and it (the dilution) will begin to occur over the rest of the year.&quot;  </p>
<p>But McKay said the effect on 1997 earnings per share would be &quot;modest,&quot; and that the acquisition opens up &quot;significant opportunities for savings of various costs and fits between the two companies.&quot;</p>
<p>J.C. Penney chief executive James Oesterreicher and Eckerd president and chief executive Frank Newman said they expect the acquisition to bring $100 million in synergies early on with additional cost savings to possibly kick in later.  </p>
<p>The synergies include savings on information systems, making use of greater purchasing power, and reducing administrative, transportation and advertising costs.</p>
<p>J.C. Penney earlier announced it had agreed to acquire Eckerd in a cash, stock and debt deal worth $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Penney will launch a $35 per share cash tender offer for 37.1 million shares and, in a second stage, will complete the purchase with a stock swap, in which Eckerd shareholders will receive 0.6604 of a Penney share for each Eckerd share.</p>
<p>Penney will also assume $760 million in Eckerd debt.  </p>
<p>Oesterreicher said J.C. Penney had been in the drug store business for 27 years and was taking advantage of a period of consolidation to establish itself as an industry leader.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a new venture, or an experiment, for us,&quot; Oesterreicher said. &quot;The drug industry is rapidly consolidating and we had a chance to be a player.&quot;</p>
<p>J.C. Penney currently has almost 1,100 Thrift drug stores. It bought Kerr Drug Stores in North Carolina in 1995, Fay's in the Northeast in October 1996, and expects to complete its previously-announced purchase of 200 Rite Aid stores in early 1997.  </p>
<p>Eckerd operates 1,724 drug stores in 13 states and 542 Eckerd Express Photo labs in 11 states. It had sales of over $5 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Newman, who is to be named chief executive of the combined drug stores operations, said Eckerd's Express Photo Labs were a key part of the deal and that on-site photo processing would be introduced into more stores of the combined company.</p>
<p>After the combination, J.C. Penney will have approximately 2,800 drug stores stretching across the Northeast, Midwest and the Sunbelt, with combined projected fiscal 1997 sales approaching $10 billion.</p>
