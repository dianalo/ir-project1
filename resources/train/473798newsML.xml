<p>Nippon Credit Bank Ltd's 1.1 percent two-year debenture due November 1997 was traded at a yield of 8.0 percent on Thursday, traders said.</p>
<p>About 100 million yen worth of the 1.1 percent debenture was traded, they said.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday, NCB's 4.8 percent five-year debenture due September 1997 was traded at a yield of 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>The market yields of NCB debentures have been under upward pressure due to comments by a ruling party official which said debentures bought by institutional investors should not be protected by public funds, a trader for a brokerage house said.  </p>
<p>Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the policy-making committee of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said in a television programme on Sunday that bank debentures sold to institutional investors should not be protected by the use of public funds.</p>
<p>Comments by Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita on Wednesday that the central bank would provide liquidity support if needed to ensure the stability of Japan's financial system, were having little effect on the market yields of NCB debentures, a trader for a brokerage house said.</p>
<p>Asked about a recent case in which a Japanese bank's debt rating was cut, seen as a reference to NCB, Matsushita said on Wednesday: &quot;It is premature to discuss steps to support such banks which issue debentures.&quot;</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service cut its rating for NCB's debentures to Ba1 from Baa3 on March 21.</p>
<p>NCB said on Thursday that restructuring steps it is considering include the possible sale of its main office in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;No formal decision has been made yet on whether to sell our main office, but such a sale is being considered as one of our possible restructuring measures,&quot; an NCB spokesman told Reuters.</p>
