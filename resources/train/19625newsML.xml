<headline>French air force flies 15 expelled immigrants out.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-08-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French air force plane carrying about 15 expelled African immigrants took off from an airbase northwest of Paris on Wednesday, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>They saw the Africans being taken aboard the Airbus which took off from Evreux airbase shortly after 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).  </p>
<p>There was no official indication of how many Africans were on board and where the plane was heading. Officials at the airbase declined to comment.</p>
<p>It was not clear how many, if any, of 300 African protesters evicted from a Paris church in a controversial police raid last week were on board.</p>
<p>Sources in the west African state of Mali said a French plane was expected after a stopover in Rabat and would fly on to Kinshasa.</p>
<p>As the plane left, several thousand demonstrators marched through Paris to demand that expulsion orders be repealed and France's tough immigration laws reviewed.</p>
