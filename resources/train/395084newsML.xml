<p>Puma AG, the German sportswear manufacturer, said on Friday it achieved a third consecutive record pre-tax profit in 1996 of 64.9 million marks and was aiming to reach even higher levels in 1997.</p>
<p>Puma, which has staged a dramatic recovery under new management after facing bankruptcy in the early 1990s, said group pre-tax profit rose about 25 percent last year from the 1995 level of 51.9 million marks.</p>
<p>Worldwide sales of the Puma brand, which includes licensing deals, rose to 1.16 billion marks from 1.13 billion marks in 1995. Group sales rose 18.4 percent to 413.6 million marks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident that we will once again improve our profitability and grow our business in 1997,&quot; Puma chief executive Joachim Zeitz told Reuters Financial Television in an interview after the company's annual news conference.</p>
<p>The higher group sales were due to &quot;clear improvement&quot; in textile sales and the consolidation for the first time of Puma's recently-acquired North American unit, Puma said.</p>
<p>Without sales from the region, which now accounts for 14 percent of Puma's revenues, the group said total group sales would have risen only 7.7 percent.</p>
<p>Investors initially approved of the results and Puma shares surged eight percent in IBIS pre-bourse dealings to 67 marks.</p>
<p>But the interest quickly soured, in part because a 74 percent surge in group net profit was padded with 24 million marks in extraordinary gains, and Puma shares quickly fell as low as 59.75 marks before paring some losses in bourse trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures in the end were below expectations and everyone's expectations were very high,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Despite the adverse market reaction, Zeitz said higher orders-in-hand would underpin Puma's growth in 1997 as it seeks to expand in North America through a new advertising campaign aimed at trend-setting youths.</p>
<p>Sales orders at the end of 1996 stood at 218 million marks, up 23 percent from 178 million marks at the end of 1995. But most of the orders were for America since the orders excluding the region rose only about 10 percent over 1995 levels.</p>
<p>Puma in January 1996 bought back the rights to its brand name in the United States and Canada from Proventus AB of Sweden, which also cut its stake in Puma to 25 percent from 82 percent last year.</p>
<p>Puma has been banking on boosting its weak U.S. presence -- less than one percent of the $28 billion U.S. sportswear market -- through its &quot;cell technology&quot; running shoe launched last summer that uses polyurethane instead of foam.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now building the platform in the U.S. and are putting together a new team and bring out new products particularly geared for the market,&quot; Zeitz said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a tough market but we are looking to make some leaps forward,&quot; Zeitz said.</p>
<p>Puma's sales in America more than doubled to 48.5 million from 20.1 million in 1995, accounting for 14 percent of Puma sales compared with only five percent in 1995. But the group noted that the expansion was cutting into its operating profit.</p>
<p>But Puma's foundation was still in Europe, where 1996 sales rose seven percent to 348.7 million marks. Strong sales were reported in eastern Europe, Britain, France, Switzerland, Germany and the Nordic regions.</p>
