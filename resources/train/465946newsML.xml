<p>Brazil is mulling the idea of substituting annualized interest rates for its monthly interest rates to prompt markets to widen their short-term focus, said Francisco Lopes, the Central Bank's director of monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the market to think in annual terms,&quot; Lopes said, noting that Brazilian rates have fallen low enough to stop the country's monthly focus on interest rates.  </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the National Monetary Council, Lopes said the bank would initially consider making the monthly based Selic overnight rate an annualized based rate.  That change could come as early as next month, he said.</p>
<p>The same might later apply to the Central Bank's basic interest rate known as the TBC, which is now set in monthly terms.</p>
<p>The current, monthly effective overnight Selic rate is 1.65 percent.  March's TBC rate is 1.62 percent and will fall to 1.58 percent in April.</p>
<p>Monthly interest rates were set at a high of about 4.0 percent in April 1995 in a bid to slow the economy and maintain foreign dollar reserves following the Mexican peso crisis.  The Central Bank began slashing rates at the end of 1995 and they have since fallen to about 1.60 percent today.</p>
<p>Real interest rates fell from an annualized 30 percent in 1995 to about 17 percent in 1996.  They are expected to fall to about 10 percent this year.</p>
