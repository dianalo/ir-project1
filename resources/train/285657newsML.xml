<headline>Technology shares and Dow lead stock rally.</headline>

<p>Stocks stormed higher Friday as technology issues staged a powerful rally and blue-chips posted one of the biggest gains ever.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 101.60 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 6,544.09.</p>
<p>Unlike Thursday, when a late rally was largely contained to blue-chip issues, Friday's advance showed much more broad support as advancing issues beat losers 1,850 to 717 on active volume of 451.9 million shares.</p>
<p>The rally wiped out a 101.10 point loss registered on the Dow on New Year's Eve and narrowed blue-chip losses to 16.82 points for the week.</p>
<p>Even with the rally, the Dow's rise was no match in percentage terms to that of the technology-rich Nasdaq Composite index. The index climbed 29.98 to 1,310.68, up 19.3 on the week, amid new optimism about the economy and an improving outlook for semiconductor companies. The gain was second only to a 33.18 point rise posted on July 17, 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock market's sharp turnaround, which reversed most of the Dow's losses for the week, showed equity investors had shaken off the jitters that a series of strong economic indicators had injected into the bond market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's renewed confidence the economy is still going to grow moderately and you're seeing that clearest in the techs,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that a flood of cash from sources like annual retirement account contributions was now finding its way into the market and likely helped fuel the rally.</p>
<p>&quot;Fund managers have got to put that money to work,&quot; said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. &quot;Today, that decision was easy. Companies like Cisco and Intel and Microsoft got the money.&quot;</p>
<p>Intel Corp. was by far Nasdaq's most active issue, leaping eight points to 138-3/8 on volume of 11.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Intel was on the receiving end of a wave of good feeling on Wall Street. Salomon Brothers upgraded the shares to strong buy from hold, citing expectations the company would beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates.</p>
<p>The shares also got a boost when Merrill Lynch cited Intel as one of the chip companies likely to perform best during a broad industry recovery in 1997.</p>
<p>Intel's rally quickly spread across the tech sector. International Business Machines Corp. jumped 5-7/8 to 159-1/8 and Microsoft Corp. rose three to 84-5/8.</p>
<p>Analysts saw signs of pent-up demand in the buying binge.</p>
<p>&quot;There had been a lot of buyers just waiting, especially on the big name techs,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot;They just needed something to get them off the fence.&quot;</p>
<p>Among individual issues, State Street Boston Corp. jumped 8-1/8 to 71 on takeover speculation set off by news Bank of New York Corp. was seeking approval to increase its stake in the company. Bank of New York rose 7/8 to 34-1/8.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 11.02 to 748.03. It was down 8.76 for the week.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange index rose 3.29 to 572.45, capping a gain of 9.48 for the week.</p>
<p>The NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks rose 4.53 to 394.06, but was down 4.04 from last Friday. The average price per share rose 47 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- stood at 7,243.282, up 95.48, or 1.34 percent. The index was up 45.575 on the week.</p>
