<p>A Turkish court has charged 68 members of the security forces with manslaughter in the beating deaths of 10 Kurdish rebel prisoners during a jail riot last year, Justice Minister Sevket Kazan said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The files have reached the Diyarbakir chief prosecutor's office and they have pressed charges. (The 68 defendants) will be tried for manslaughter,&quot; Kazan was quoted by the state-run Anatolian news agency as saying.</p>
<p>Kazan did not say why the lesser charge of manslaughter, which carries a jail sentence of between eight and 15 years, was brought. Capital punishment or jail terms of up to 30 years can be passed for first-degree murder.</p>
<p>Turkey's parliamentary human rights commission last month called for the trial of 30 soldiers and 38 policeman for their part in the bloody quelling of September's riot in a high-security jail in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir.</p>
<p>The commission said security forces, armed with shields and batons, used force to break up a protest about food supplies by jailed members of the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).</p>
<p>An autopsy report released last month gave the cause of death of most of the 10 prisoners as &quot;brain damage&quot; but did not explain how the injuries could have occurred. The bodies had bruising and wounds, the report said.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year fight between the Turkish army and the PKK, which is seeking autonomy or independence in southeast Turkey.</p>
