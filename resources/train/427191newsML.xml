<p>Nepal's King Birendra on Friday set a deadline of March 10 for the country's political parties to stake a claim to power after the centrist government lost a confidence vote.</p>
<p>&quot;His Majesty the King has called upon members of the House of Representatives to make a submission to His Majesty by 6 p.m. (1215 GMT) on March 10, clearly establishing one's ability to command support and confidence from a majority of members of the House of Representatives,&quot; the Royal Palace said in a communique.  </p>
<p>The king issued the communique, which was broadcast on state-owned Radio Nepal, after prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba resigned on Thursday following the defeat of his 17-month-old coalition in a confidence vote.</p>
<p>King Birendra asked the three-party coalition headed by Deuba's centrist Nepali Congress party to continue in power until the formation of a new council of ministers.</p>
<p>No single party controls a majority in Nepal's hung parliament which emerged from general elections in November 1994.</p>
<p>The communist United Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, which ruled for 10 months until Deuba's coalition took office in September 1995, was expected to try to stake a claim to reassume power.</p>
