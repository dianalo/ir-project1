<p>Sheldahl Inc, which earlier reported a loss for its fiscal third quarter of $0.19 a share compared with a year-ago profit of $0.16, said its results were hurt by automotive industry strikes.</p>
<p>&quot;Our third quarter results came in as we had anticipated in our public statement a month ago,&quot; company president James Donaghy said in a statement. &quot;Strikes at Chrysler and General Motors, which affected our shipping schedules, and automotive model mix changes that came about as a result of lower-than- projected auto build rates, reduced our revenue by nearly $2 million.&quot;  </p>
<p>It reported revenues for the third quarter ended May 30 of $27.6 million, down from $29.7 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the capacity in place to make up the shortfall; the determining factor will be our customers' capacities,&quot; Donaghy said. &quot;We anticipate that automotive work stoppages will continue into our fourth quarter, but will not have as pronounced an effect on results as they did in the third quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Sheldahl makes high-density substrates, high-quality flexible printed circuitry and flexible laminates, primarily for sale to the automotive electronics and data communications markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot help but be disappointed in our results,&quot; Donaghy said. &quot;However, we continue to believe that we are on course to maintain an average 25 percent annualized growth in the automotive sector, and are currently production-ready and certified to begin volume manufacturing at our Micro Products plant.&quot;</p>
