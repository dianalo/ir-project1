<p>Italian industry is calling for it and the government is counting on it, but Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio is likely to resist pressure for an interest rate cut for quite a while yet, analysts said in Monday.</p>
<p>This was the feeling of most analysts polled by Reuters following first data from five Italian cities pointing to June consumer price inflation falling further to 1.5 percent from 1.6 percent in May.</p>
<p>A further six cities were due to release their CPI data at 1530 GMT on Monday.</p>
<p>But the analysts were divided over when the central bank would move and by how much it would shave off its 6.75 percent discount rate.</p>
<p>And many said they did not fully understand the policy being followed by the Bank which last touched the discount rate on January 22, reducing it from 7.50 percent.</p>
<p>For some, the Bank seems to be now focusing more on European single currency convergence and the implied overhaul of state finances with welfare state reform than on CPI data.</p>
<p>Others, however, are taking as gospel Fazio's recent warning about seeing the last glowing embers of inflation extinguished before moving on rates. These analysts cited worries linked to an upward adjustment of value added tax, the cost of labour and expectations of future price rises.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that Fazio might have information about a possible upturn in inflation which we don't have. But he is also looking elsewhere, perhaps at the exchange rate -- which however is doing well at the moment -- or at the dynamics of the whole EMU process,&quot; said Marcello Esposito of Banca Commerciale Italiana.</p>
<p>&quot;The present situation does not allow a rate cut. The jury is still out on the basic question of fiscal policy, and an out of control deficit like Italy's could lead, together with rising labour costs, to an upturn in inflation,&quot; said Giovanni Polastri of 4cast.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation will certainly be clearer in September, both on the domestic front as well as the EMU front,&quot; he said, adding that he was not so certain that a cut would be possible even then.</p>
<p>More optimistic was Renzo Avesani of Cariplo, seeing a fairly near-term cut. &quot;Fazio is well late. We need at least a cut of 125 basis points by the end of this year, perhaps in two stages. Even if he cut by 75 bps and then by 50 bps, it would not have an impact on the lira or long-term rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Giuseppe Abbotto of Banque Indosuez said, &quot;If the Bank doesn't cut tonight then I don't know when it could.&quot;</p>
<p>But Francesco Giordano di CSFB said a cut now would be difficult. &quot;After all, the major drop in inflation happened two months ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Andrea Conti of Deutsche Bank agreed. &quot;A cut tonight or this week would be very surprising because it would contradict Fazio's latest comments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gianluca Sanna of Stone &amp; McCarthy saw a possible cut in July: &quot;The market will force Fazio's hand. The market is more and more convinced of the EMU starting on time with a broad group of countries.&quot;</p>

<p>   By year-end	   1/10</p>
<p>3) By how much?</p>
<p>   50 bps		  2/10</p>
<p>   50/75 bps	     1/10</p>
<p>   75 bps		  3/10</p>
<p>   75/100 bps	    2/10</p>
