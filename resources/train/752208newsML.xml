<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Thursday.</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 index ended modestly lower in meagre volume as investors decided to take a breather from the market's recent turbulence and British stocks shadowed a weaker performance in the U.S. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,862.9, down 11.6 points, or 0.24 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Stocks took the chance to consolidate, dropping sharply as investors took profits on banking stocks after days of an apparently inexorable rally. The DAX-30 index closed at 4,335.74, down 70.35 points, or 1.60 percent. In later screen-based trade, the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,320.52, down 64.30 points, or 1.47 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - Stocks closed 1 percent lower on profit-taking from recent record highs, dealers said. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,973.53, down 30.00 points, or 1.00 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Stocks ended a volatile session slightly lower in a correction of Wednesday's three percent jump. The Swiss market index closed at 5,849.2, down 20.7 points, or 0.35 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks closed modestly higher, partly heartened by another bullish run on Wall Street overnight, brokers said. The 225-stock Nikkei average closed at 20,286.23, up 155.72 points, or 0.77 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stock prices ended lower after a strong morning rally into record ground was followed by profit-taking during the afternoon. The Hang Seng index closed at 15,709.23, down 29.58 points, or 0.19 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - A choppy stock market wobbled to a weaker close with rate cut expectations, a soft result from bank heavyweight National Australia Bank Ltd and July series options expiry all making up a less than clear picture. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,676.4, down 7.0 points, or 0.26 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Stocks finished weaker, unable to sustain Wednesday's bull run on the back of Wall Street without fresh local news from either government or the Reserve Bank, dealers said. The All-Stock index closed at 7,427.0, down 19.9 points, or 0.27 percent. The All-Gold index closed at 952.6, down 29.8 points, or 3.03 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 9,026.3, down 6.0 points, or 0.07 percent.</p>
