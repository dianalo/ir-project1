<p>Indian newspapers have forecast several measures likely to be announced in the country's 1997/98 (April-March) federal budget, due to be unveiled by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Friday.</p>
<p>The following are some highlights:</p>
<p>ON TAXES</p>
<p>**  The Business Standard says Finance Minister P. Chidambaram is expected to unveil a big-bang budget which could include direct tax changes like the withdrawal of double taxation of dividends, introduction of an expenditure-based assessment in the case of professionals like doctors and engineers and a possible tax on expenditure.</p>
<p>A 7.5 percent corporate surcharge is likely to be withdrawn, the newspaper says.</p>
<p>It adds that policy changes relating to indirect taxes could include a reduction in average level of tariff to around 30 percent from the current 40. The peak tariff rate is likely to remain unchanged.</p>
<p>**  The Financial Express says luxury tax levies are likely in the federal budget including a $5,000 fee on non-resident Indians, levies on telephone ownership, large electricity consumers, domestic air travel, cars and property ownership.</p>
<p>ON THE FISCAL DEFICIT</p>
<p>**  Business Standard sees renewed effort to curb burgeoning fiscal deficit and further fillip to tax reforms in forthcoming budget.</p>
<p>An ambitious divestment target is expected to make up for enhanced social spending. Chidambaram is likely to propose a fiscal deficit target of 4.5 percent of GDP for 1997/98.</p>
<p>ON CAPITAL MARKETS</p>
<p>**  State Bank of India Chairman P.G. Kakodkar says in the Observer newspaper that Chidambaram's first target should be improving capital market conditions.</p>
<p>This includes eliminating double taxation on dividends, restructuring MAT and exempting some shares relating to infrastructure from capital gains tax.</p>
<p>**  Economic Times says recent Economic Survey statement that &quot;tax deductions and exemptions cannot be a substitute for reforms of policy and procedures,&quot; is significant in view of the persistent demands from capital markets for tax reliefs to revive markets.</p>
<p>INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
<p>**  The Economic Times says a fresh round of policy statements on infrastructure is likely.</p>
<p>Announcements could include allowing insurance companies, pension and provident funds to invest a sizeable percent of their corpus either in infrastructure funds or directly in projects and an exemption or reduction of tariffs on imports of technology required for infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>EXPORTS</p>
<p>**  The Economic Times says commerce ministry has put forward list seeking tax concessions to help exports.</p>
<p>The government could identify thrust export industries like leather, gems and jewellery, and textiles where fiscal incentives could be increased. Could dilute MAT for exporters.</p>
