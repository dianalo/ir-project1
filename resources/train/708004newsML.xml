<p>Cyprus must raise productivity and keep pay demands under control to improve the country's competitiveness and promote high growth, Bank of Cyprus governor Afxentis Afxentiou said on Friday.</p>
<p>The island's economy recorded a slowdown last year, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growing by 1.9 percent after 6.0 percent in 1995 and 5.2 percent in 1994. This year growth is expected to improve to 2.5 percent, helped by a recovery in tourism which accounts for a fifth of GDP.</p>
<p>Afxentiou, presenting his bank's annual report for 1996, denied the economy was in trouble. He said inflation was low and the balance of payments was in &quot;tolerable&quot; deficit. But he added the economy was in danger of losing competitiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in income beyond the levels of productivity has consequences on the economy,&quot; he said. Earnings grew by 2.6 percent in real terms in 1996 after 3.4 percent in 1995, while productivity rose by 0.9 percent after 1.9 percent.</p>
<p>Afxentiou commented: &quot;We must all understand we have to adjust our mentality. Incomes are earned with hard work and not trade union struggles and we must learn that if we want to progress economically more than we have until now we must increase our productivity.&quot;</p>
<p>Tourism arrivals contracted by seven percent last year because of mid-summer turmoil on the militarily divided island.</p>
<p>In the first four months of 1997 arrival rates were down by an additional 4.4 percent, but in May the situation improved and tourist arrivals increased by five percent, Afxentiou said.</p>
