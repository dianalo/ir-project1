<title>JAPAN: Japan nuclear reactor shut down after leak.</title>

<p>Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) halted operations at a nuclear reactor on Tuesday after a brief rise in radioactivity in exhaust gas at the plant, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said there was no alert declared or evacuation of the plant or of residents around it at Fukushima, about 200 km (125 miles) north of Tokyo.</p>
<p>But the shutdown was a new blow to Japan's nuclear power programme, which was hit last month by the country's worst nuclear accident when fire broke out at a nuclear fuel processing plant.</p>
<p>&quot;The incident was never a serious threat but we took early precautions by shutting the plant down,&quot; a TEPCO spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the alarm on a monitor checking the level of radioactivity of exhaust gas at Fukushima No. 2 Nuclear Power Plant's No. 2 reactor sounded at 6.55 p.m. (0955 GMT) on Monday.</p>
<p>The company lowered generating power and then shut down the 1.1 million kilowatt reactor completely about 12 hours later, he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said a gauge that measured gas produced when steam condensed in the reactor indicated the level of radioactivity was 20 times higher than normal after the alarm sounded.</p>
<p>But checks on Tuesday showed there was no radioactivity leakage anywhere in the plant, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>He said the brief rise in radiation was caused by a pinhole leak in part of a cover over a nuclear fuel rod in the reactor.</p>
<p>The plant would be shut for about three weeks while the cover was repaired and other checks were carried out, he said.</p>
<p>A scandal involving a possible cover-up has broken out over last month's more serious fire at the Tokaimura nuclear processing plant, where 37 workers were exposed to low-level radiation.</p>
<p>In the incident at Tokaimura, about 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Tokyo, nuclear authorities and residents were not advised of a radiation threat, setting off a storm of criticism about safety standards in the nuclear industry, which supplies nearly one-third of Japan's power.</p>
<p>There was also outrage that Tokaimura officials failed to realise they had not completely extinguished the fire, leading to an explosion 12 hours later.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto apologised to the nation for the accident and ordered a police investigation.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the scandal widened when the state-run Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen), operator of the plant, said that an unidentified official had destroyed several photographs taken of the fire on March 11.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of an in-house investigation, we found that allegations (about the disposal of the photos) were true,&quot; Donen spokesman Masaharu Watarase told reporters.</p>
<p>The investigation has also shown that Donen employees falsified their report of the timing of the fire, saying they confirmed the fire was out when an inspection had not been carried out.</p>
