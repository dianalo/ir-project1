<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-06-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brent crude futures were untraded by midday on Tuesday but were under pressure to break below key support at $17.54, brokers said.</p>
<p>July Brent was quoted on SIMEX at $17.45/$17.60 per barrel after London settled at $17.56 per barrel for a loss of 14 cents on the day.</p>
<p>However, July traded in London time as low as $17.54 -- the lowest since April 10. A break below $17.54 would take prices to their lowest level since June 14, 1996.</p>
<p>Brokers said Brent was likely to fall below $17.54 later in the day or during London trading.  </p>
<p>NYMEX July futures were down on ACCESS after New York dropped 11 cents to $18.68 after hitting a fresh 16 month low of $18.60.</p>
<p>July NYMEX was last traded on ACCESS at $18.62 per barrel after falling in New York ACCESS trade to $18.55.</p>
<p>Rising crude stocks and refinery runs in the U.S., ample Atlantic Basin supply and a renewal of the Iraq oil-for-food deal were undermining prices.</p>
