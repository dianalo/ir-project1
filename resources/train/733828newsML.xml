<headline>OPINION - Debt yields' convergence by M. Trischler.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-07-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>By Michael Trischler, Chief economist at Societe Generale in Frankfurt</p>
<p>The likelihood that European monetary union will begin on time has increased in the eyes of the financial markets following the Amsterdam summit. Under the mottoes &quot;wide euro = weak euro = punctual euro&quot;, the prevailing opinion is that political will will win through ... at least as long as the divergence from the treaty is not too great.</p>
<p>However, how this will take place is far from being settled. Sustainable convergence as set out in the Maastricht treaty, and as already put into operation in the EMI convergence reports, presents a stricter entrance examination than the numerical cutoff values in the protocol (3 percent and 60 percent).</p>
<p>It will not be possible to ignore the Article 7 reports, the EMI report and the scheduled statement from the Bundesbank (with a view to the German constitutional court) in Spring 1998.</p>
<p>However, we are not that far yet: the 1997 books are not yet closed, and the budgets for 1998 and the following years are still in preparation. The three-point-zero requirement, originally a pharisaical argument linked to eurosceptical reservations, was cleverly turned into an appeal to France and has already had an effect.</p>
<p>The French government will present its policy mix with regard to the additional conditions presented by the Maastricht treaty in the autumn, after the return from the summer holidays. The solution will tend towards more redistribution (Finanzpolitik means more debt management) and a convergence programme similar to that in Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the German-French debate on issues of principle (government intervention versus the free market principle) and romanesque theatrical thunder are scheduled for the autumn.</p>
<p>Attempts by the Commission (de Silguy) and Luxembourg EU-presidency to announce the internal European exchange rate fixing method before the decision as to the members is made, preferably before the end of this year is even more important.</p>
<p>In the face of the expected nervousness about this, the technical method must take away the basis for speculative or deliberate market attacks, which could create an irreversible fait accompli (which could be dangerous with regard to the exchange rate criterium).</p>
<p>The issue then is only the fixing of the exchange rates of the membership countries in relation to each other. As the conversion has to be carried out using the market quotations in the historical second of &quot;E-day&quot; on 31.12.1998, the actual daily rates will have to reach the desired internal relationship by that time, if frictions are to be avoided.</p>
<p>(Irrespective of that, the absolute value of the converters will not be determined until the last second using the Korb-ECU vehicle).</p>
<p>Clarity as to the method (average rate or central rate method) would have immediate effect due to the need to balance out futures arbitrages.</p>
<p>The decision is likely to fall in favour of the central rate method: the central rates have already been &quot;negotiated&quot; and in addition are seen to have been &quot;tested&quot; by the market.  </p>
<p>An early announcement of the conversion method - possibly before the participants have been determined in May 1998 - would have the following consequences:</p>
<p>1. Depending on the method, an expected value for the internal fixed rate would develop, towards which the exchange rates would converge (irrespective of the remaining risk that a country will not be included in the first wave of participants).</p>
<p>2. A more precise expected value would be tradeable with the central rate method - almost a guaranteed forward rate up until 4.1.1999.</p>
<p>3. In order to balance the forwards market, money market interest rates (or rates close to the money market rates) with a maturity of 4.1.99 will converge to a marginal remaining risk premium. The arbitrage along the currency yield curve would then &quot;pull down&quot; the yields for medium-term maturities.</p>
<p>4. In this way not only would the interest rate spreads disappear at the long end of the market, (though with the exception of credit/liquidity spreads), but also in the medium-term, and finally in the money market maturities. This assumes that the central banks will also use the scope offered by the market to lower their key rates. (With the exception of Ireland, which is experiencing a boom, the economic climate Europe-wide continues to require a relaxed monetary policy).</p>
<p>5. The European yield curves are currently flatter than the German benchmark - a late consequence of the rule of thumb from the EMS-days, according to which a currency &quot;is defended at the short end of the market&quot;. The risk premiums on the money market would be redundant to a large extent, the yield curves would have to take on the German form within a short time.</p>
<p>This would give institutional investors the chance to back convergence one last time. Convergence gains would no longer be interesting in the long-term maturities, which would also be threatened by rate losses caused by the general interest rate development, but in the short- and medium-term region of the yield curve.</p>
<p>6. Following completion of this arbitrage round, the exchange rates of the expected participating countries would would be finally fixed - even if only in the internal European relationship (block-floating).</p>
<p>Every fluctuation would be a deal for arbitrageurs due to the futures market balance and the almost guaranteed futures rates. Soros &amp; Co. would have no hope, especially if the central banks could also agree on intervention in the futures markets.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: The idea of announcing early the internal European exchange rate framework, that is the relationship to each other in which the currencies pass over into the euro, can also stabilise exchange rates in the critical euro-countdown phase.</p>
<p>This would not influence the decision as to the participants in any way, on the contrary, damage to the exchange rate criterion due to pure market speculations would be impossible.</p>
<p>Irrespective of whether this suggestion will win through this year, or not until May 1998, we are just before the last stage on the way to uniform interest rates.... It's time to make plans.</p>
