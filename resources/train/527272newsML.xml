<p>South African money market rates edged lower again on Tuesday as the shortage fell to its lowest level in six months.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank said the shortage fell to 6.743 billion rand on Monday -- its lowest level since September 25 last year when it was pegged at 6.989 billion rand.</p>
<p>The &quot;big four&quot; banks all quoted their three-month NCD rates lower at between 16.40 to 16.45 percent offered from 16.45 to 16.50 percent on Monday. The 90-day BA rate also eased to between 15.80 to 16.00 percent from 15.85 and 16.05 previously.</p>
<p>A Reserve Bank official said the latest fall in the shortage stemmed from a mismatch in government flows and that the shortage would &quot;correct&quot; itself within the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Dealers said that despite the expected rise in the shortage again on Wednesday, liquidity was looking in better shape and that sentiment had improved along with it.</p>
<p>&quot;There is scope for call rates to drop a little bit and scope for NCDs to move down 30 to 40 points quite easily,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Call has fallen to between 15.50 to 15.75 percent after hovering consistently around the 16.00 percent mark in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Another senior trader felt that while liquidity had improved, the market would have to see a sustained lower shortage before rates moved lower.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to see this follow through,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe that a shortage of seven billion rand is rather a large shortage. It is just one that we have become used to in terms of the higher one.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are seeing at the moment is a slight change in sentiment but I don't expect rates to go any further,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Bond yields took heart from the improved sentiment in the short-end. The key R150 was last trading at a 14.87 percent yield -- its lowest level since March 17 this year.</p>
<p>On the forward market, rates moved to a nine-month low before retracing slightly.</p>
<p>One year forward rates briefly touched 40.20 -- their lowest level since July 23 last year -- before retracing to last trade at 40.75 points.</p>
<p>Braam Verhage, senior forward trader at First National Bank, said that forward rates had moved lower on very thin volumes and were expected to pull back further in the afternoon session.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a lot of movement happened without trading ...some of the guys just started marking it down and I think they will come back this afternoon,&quot; Verhage said. &quot;I don't think one should read too much into it.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders have said recently that forward rates have moved lower in anticipation of another U.S. interest rate hike in the near future, which would narrow interest rate differentials.</p>
<p>But Verhage said: &quot;If you look at where we are trading in comparison with the interest rate differential, we are trading up to 300 points below that in the longer end.</p>
<p>&quot;The general consensus in the market is that another quarter percent hike in the U.S. is just about discounted at the moment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>U.S. interest rates were last hiked by 25 basis points on March 25 and traders believe that another 25 basis point hike could be on the cards when the Federal Reserve holds its Federal Open Market Committee meeting later next month.</p>
