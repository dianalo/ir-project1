<p>Japan&quot;s money supply growth of 3.1 percent in January was largely a reflection of continuing sluggishness in Japan&quot;s economy that suppressed both bank lending and private spending, economists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some added that money supply growth could well diminish even further, edging down below three percent after the start of the 1997 fiscal year in April.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) said earlier on Tuesday that Japan&quot;s broadly defined money supply average of M2 plus certificates of deposit (CDs) grew a preliminary 3.1 percent year on year in January.  </p>
<p>This was unchanged from the revised figure of 3.1 percent growth in December 1996.</p>
<p>Economists agreed that a key factor behind slow money growth appeared to be weak bank lending, citing last week&quot;s BOJ figures indicating that the average balance of lending by 149 Japanese banks dipped 0.2 percent in January from a year earlier, the fourth month in a row of year-on-year declines.</p>
<p>&quot;Without growth in bank lending, it&quot;s impossible to expect overall growth in money supply. The low bank lending figures definitely reflect the weakness of the economy,&quot; said Yasuhiko Ushikubo, an economist with the Industrial Bank of Japan.  </p>
<p>Ryo Sawai, an economist with Yamaichi Research Institute, agreed. Noting that the 3.1 percent figure had been slightly lower than expected, he added that it seemed to indicate a subtle negative shift in expectations for the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we had been seeing a slight pickup of investment in plant and equipment, this has been offset by a general decline in private spending,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A BOJ official told reporters that the figures were in line with the central bank&quot;s prediction that money supply growth would remain above three percent from January through March this year.  </p>
<p>Although some economists said this was possible, most agreed that money supply growth is likely to follow a downward course once the new fiscal year begins.</p>
<p>&quot;A break below three percent would not be at all strange, given the state of the economy, with bank lending likely to decrease even more,&quot; said Kyohei Morita, an economist at Nomura Research Institute.</p>
