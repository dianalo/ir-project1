<headline>Talks on to free Shell staff held by Nigerians.</headline>

<p>Negotiations were going on on Wednesday to free 88 staff of oil giant Shell still held hostage by Nigerian tribesmen protesting against the relocation of their local council headquarters, officials said.</p>
<p>Three people died on Tuesday when the protests escalated into riots in the midwestern oil town of Warri, local newspapers reported.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking to all parties we feel can resolve the situation,&quot; said a Shell spokesman in Lagos.</p>
<p>&quot;The matter is being addressed by the Delta state government and community leaders,&quot; said a federal government official from the capital Abuja.</p>
<p>Originally 127 Shell staff, all Nigerians, were detained by Ijaw tribesmen who have occupied Shell's flow stations since Saturday in protest against the action of the military government in moving the headquarters.</p>
<p>Negotiations secured the release of 18 on Monday and 12 on Tuesday, six of them injured although not seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from those we told you about earlier it has come to our knowledge that nine of the people detained left on Saturday and Monday by their own methods so 88 are now being held,&quot; the Shell spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The three-million-strong Ijaws, who straddle Nigeria's riverine oil-producing states, are unhappy over the relocation of the headquarters of the newly created Warri South-West local government area to the rival Ogidigben town from Ogbe-Ijoh.</p>
<p>Similar relocations in other parts of the vast West African nation have also caused isolated protests.</p>
<p>The current crisis does not directly involve Shell but the multinational is caught up in it because of its high profile in Nigeria and huge operations in the Warri area.</p>
<p>The Shell spokesman said community leaders had met state officials and the company was hopeful this could lead to the release of its staff.</p>
<p>&quot;At least dialogue has been established,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shell said it was concerned about one seriously injured person who was not allowed to go free on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After the attack Shell shut down operations in the six stations and cut back crude production by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd), about five percent of Nigeria's total output of almost two million bpd.</p>
<p>World oil prices have, however, not been affected and Shell says Nigerian export volumes remain the same.</p>
<p>Nigeria is Africa's largest producer of crude oil, and Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) with an output of about 2.15 million bpd.</p>
<p>Shell, which pumps about half the country's oil output, has often been the target of environmental protests and sabotage such as the one that forced its withdrawal from the volatile Ogoniland in 1993.</p>
<p>Shell's Nigerian operations came into worldwide focus in 1995 after Nigeria executed nine Ogoni tribe minority rights activists including author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</p>
<p>Saro-Wiwa was leader of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples (MOSOP), which had been campaigning against the company's environmental policies there.</p>
