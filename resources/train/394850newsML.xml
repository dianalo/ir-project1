<title>UK: Energy to debut as rarity, with growth.</title>
<headline>Energy to debut as rarity, with growth.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Energy Group, set to debut officially on the London stock exchange on Monday, has good growth prospects but remains difficult to value because of its diversity, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I genuinely think if there is a chance of growth this is it, but valuing Energy is difficult because it is a very different animal from other utility stocks,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Energy is the last part of Anglo-U.S. conglomerate Hanson Plc to be demerged as a separate company following last October's spin-off of Imperial Tobacco and U.S.-quoted Millennium Chemicals.</p>
<p>It will join a sector which has been whittled down by take-overs over the last two years as regional electricity companies (Recs) have been snapped up to leave just two out of an original 12 set up at privatisation in 1990.</p>
<p>Energy's demerger, which offers shareholders one Energy share for every 10 existing Hanson shares held, was approved by shareholders on Friday, leaving Hanson with building services businesses.</p>
<p>Energy shares on the so-called &quot;grey market&quot; were trading around 520 pence by 1146 GMT on Friday and analysts felt official trading would kick off at similar levels.</p>
<p>&quot;We think 530 pence is about right, maybe a little lower,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Energy owns Eastern, Britain's fourth largest electricity generator and distribution business, along with U.S.-Australian Peabody Coal.</p>
<p>It will be large enough to rank inside Britain's top 100 blue chips and the Fortune 500 in the U.S., where it will also be quoted.</p>
<p>Analysts said the diversity of its interests made it difficult to value or find comparisons.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a hybrid, but it probably sits most comfortably in the UK market with an integrated power company such as Scottish Power,&quot; David Campbell of Greig Middleton said.</p>
<p>He added that Energy's integrated UK power business was one of its potential strengths.</p>
<p>In addition, analysts said the potential for using electricity expertise to help Peabody Coal expand in this area in the U.S. could also help Energy's growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Peabody could be the most interesting. It's a clear chance to expand into electricity in the U.S.,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>There has been some speculation that Peabody Coal could be spun off from the UK electricity interests but on Friday, Energy Group's chairman Derek Bonham ruled this out.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I have had enough of demergers and I think (the two) fit very well together,&quot; he replied to a shareholder question.</p>
<p>Energy has already said it is mulling a string of acquisitions in Britain and North America and has started talks with a U.S. power marketing company.</p>
<p>&quot;Energy will be substantially cash generative until it starts making acquisitions,&quot; Campbell said.</p>
<p>Energy said in its official listing prospectus that it aimed to become &quot;an integrated energy supplier in the U.S., UK and Australia,&quot; with longer-term plans to develop the energy business in other countries.</p>
<p>It also said it wanted to consider &quot;potential investments in U.S. electricity generation.&quot;</p>
<p>Campbell said he expected earnings growth of around 12 percent annually in the next two years and dividend growth of around seven percent a year &quot;for the foreseeable future.&quot;</p>
<p>Energy's annual turnover in the year to September 30, 1996 was 3.6 billion pounds, with pre-exceptional profits of 446 million pounds and total assets are 5.7 billion pounds.</p>
<p>It comes to the market with 1.4 billion pounds of debt. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
