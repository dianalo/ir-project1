<p>Central bank dollar purchases helped the Indian rupee close steady at 35.7000/7050 on Wednesday, a day when the U.S. currency firmed across the board, setting a 47-month high against the Swiss franc, dealers said.</p>
<p>Most of the day's deals were at 35.700/7025 rupees to a dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>The central Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hit the market in late afternoon, buying dollars at 35.7000 and 35.7050, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the spot dollar-rupee market had become dull in the absence of fresh market-moving factors.</p>
<p>Most dealers said they did not expect any major movement in the exchange rate until the end of September.</p>
<p>&quot;I see a lot of inflows over the next three months,&quot; Arun Dobe, director (forex) at Bank of America, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand would pick up by October/November if IOC (Indian Oil Corporation) enters the market (to buy dollars to pay for its oil imports),&quot; he said. IOC has been funding oil imports through offshore loans as the government owes its over 100 billion rupees in unpaid dues for subsidising sales of oil products.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't see the rupee going below the 35.60-mark,&quot; Dobe said. He said the rupee should move in the 35.60/80 band over the next few months.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the forward premiums ended a shade down as overnight call rates showed signs of easing, dealers said.</p>
<p>But the movement was on thin volumes, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;There won't be volumes until fresh factors emerge to move the market,&quot; a dealer at a foreign bank said.</p>
<p>The six month annualised forward premium closed the day at 3.64 percent compared to the previous close of 3.70 percent.</p>
