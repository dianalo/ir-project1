<headline>Prosecutor completes probe into tycoon Schneider.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Frankfurt state prosecutors' office said on Friday it had completed an investigation into property tycoon Juergen Schneider and would announce details at a news conference on Monday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Schneider committed fraud relating to the spectacular collapse of his property empire under debts of more than five billion marks ($3.25 billion) in 1994.</p>
<p>The prosecutors' office said in December it would file formal fraud charges against Schneider in early January. A spokesman for the office declined to say on Friday whether Schneider had already been charged.</p>
<p>One of the tycoon's lawyers, Christoph Rueckel, said last month Schneider would be formally charged with fraud and credit fraud as well as falsifying documents and fraudulent bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Schneider, who is being held in jail, bought some of Germany's most prestigious real estate in the post-unification property boom.</p>
<p>But he slid toward bankruptcy because the rental income was too small to finance huge debts he took on to buy the properties.</p>
<p>Schneider fled the country in April 1994 with his wife Claudia, abandoning his troubled property group. Prosecutors allege he obtained credit on the basis of falsified documents.</p>
<p>The Schneiders were detained in Miami in 1995 after a year-long international manhunt. They returned voluntarily to Germany last February to face questioning.</p>
<p>Claudia Schneider, who has been freed from prison on conditional release amid concerns about her health, is expected to be charged with being an accessory to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Two former associates, Mehdi Djawadi, alleged to have helped the Schneiders plan their getaway, and Karl-Heinrich Kuepferle are also expected to be charged.</p>
<p>Frankfurt prosecutors have said the trial is unlikely to begin before mid-1997. (1=1.5462 Mark)</p>
