<p>Russia's Gazprom monopolist gas exporter said on Wednesday that natural gas supplies to Ukraine would be cut back because of huge debts but promised to help the former Soviet republic build up strategic gas resources.</p>
<p>&quot;It was agreed that the Ukrainian side would take all necessary steps to pay its debt to Gazprom, &quot; Gazprom's press office said in a statement issued after its head, Rem Vyakhirev, held talks with top Ukrainian officials in Kiev.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas supplies to Intergaz and United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU) will be limited because of the debts,&quot; said the statement, a copy of which was faxed to Reuters.</p>
<p>Gazprom, frustrated over countries not paying their bills, cut flows to Ukraine on Tuesday by about one third and to Belarus by 50 percent. Supplies to Ukraine were down to around 37 million cubic metres per day. Deliveries to Belarus resumed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gazprom's statement said that despite cuts in supplies to two main privately-owned Ukrainian importers, the company would continue to supply gas for Ukraine's strategic resources under an existing contract.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Vyakhirev agreed that Gazprom would meet its obligations and supply an extra five billion cubic metres to fill Ukraine's underground gas depots, the statement said.</p>
<p>It was not clear how much gas had originally been agreed under this agreement signed last August.</p>
<p>Kuchma said after talks with Vyakhirev that Kiev would stick to a scheme of distributing Russian gas by private traders instead of state-owned companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The current scheme has proved itself. But some corrections should be made in terms of equal conditions for all traders. In general the current scheme will not change in 1998,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no contradictions with Gazprom about that,&quot; he told a joint news conference with visiting Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan.</p>
<p>A top aide to Kuchma called for &quot;demonopolisation&quot; of Ukraine's inefficient energy market.</p>
<p>Ukraine, the world's single largest consumer and conveyor of Russian gas, is due this year to import 53 billion cubic metres of Russian gas. It will transport about 125 billion cubic metres via its territory to Europe.</p>
<p>Ukraine owes Gazprom $3.5 billion for 1992-94 supplies, including $1.4 billion already restructured for 12 years with the first $221.5 million tranche to be paid by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Ukraine has allowed private traders to import and distribute Russian gas since 1995. But the system has not improved the bad payments record of previous years. United Energy Systems of Ukraine and Intergaz owe Gazprom $150 million.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, who resigned earlier this month, was the architect and main defender of the private traders' scheme.</p>
<p>Critics said the scheme was monopolistic and linked Lazarenko to UESU, to which the government gave the lion's share of gas distribution contracts to supply Ukraine's two most powerful industrial regions, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk.</p>
<p>&quot;The state of the gas market needs serious involvement in terms of demonopolisation and artificial transfer of foreign debts into domestic ones,&quot; Anatoly Halchynsky, Kuchma's top economic advisor, told a news briefing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This state of affairs should be corrected. We are losing a lot transferring all debts to our population and enterprises,&quot; he added, referring to a 6.7 billion hryvnias ($3.6 billion) backlog in unpaid wages, pensions and student grants.</p>
<p>Some analysts suggested quotas might be redistributed to traders who would also be asked to provide more cash payments.</p>
