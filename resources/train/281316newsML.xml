<headline>Israeli workers in fourth day of strike. [CORRECTED 08:15 GMT]</headline>

<p>(Corrects headline and text to make clear Monday is the fourth rather than the third day of strikes.)</p>
<p>Striking workers hit large sectors of Israel's economy on Monday in protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's austerity budget and privatisation plans.</p>
<p>The fourth day of strikes involved tens of thousands of workers and covered most of the public sector, costing the economy millions of dollars, officials said.</p>
<p>Banks, government offices and the Tel Aviv stock exchange were closed as a result of the strike, public hospitals were giving only emergency treatment and phone, transportation and postal services were being affected.</p>
<p>Seaports were closed for a fourth day running and radio and television bradcasts were being disrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;We view this strike as a political strike. We think political disagreements should be settled in political ways and not on the backs of the business sector which is suffering severely,&quot; said the president of the manufacturers' association Danny Gillerman.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate the damage from the strikes in the ports alone at around $10 million a day,&quot; he told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Last Thursday the powerful Histadrut labour federation launched a series of gradually widening strikes that were due to culminate in a general strike on Tuesday, the last day of the year when parliament was due to vote on next year's budget.</p>
<p>The govenrment 1997 government proposal calls for seven billion shekels ($2.15) in spending cuts, new taxes and other revenue-raising measures that Netanyahu said were needed to rein in soaring deficits. The prime minister has also promised to privatise dozens of government-owned companies.</p>
<p>Union leaders say the measures will lead to a huge erosion in workers' salaries.</p>
<p>&quot;The workers alone will be forced to pay the price...for the government's big exercise in fraud. Next year the salary of every worker will be eroded by 2,500 to 3,000 shekels,&quot; said Histadrut leader Amir Peretz.</p>
<p>The government ordered about 500 workers of the Bezeq phone company and 50 employees at the government's Armament Development Authority to return to work, Israel Radio said.</p>
<p>Thousands of workers walked off their jobs on Sunday and others ignored court orders to show up for work after police arrested trade union leader Shlomo Shani for failing to appear before a labour court in connection with the strike.</p>
<p>&quot;Strikes are legitimate...but the law must be respected,&quot; Finance Minister Dan Meridor told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Monday's strike would last at least until 4 p.m. (1400 GMT), union leaders said.</p>
