<headline>U.S. court rules against insurance co. in AIDS case.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO 1997-02-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>The California state Supreme Court ruled Monday that a life insurance company must pay out $180,000 on a policy obtained by an HIV-positive man who sent an impostor to take his medical examination.</p>
<p>The state high court in San Francisco called the deception by the now-deceased policyholder, Jose Morales, &quot;abhorrent,&quot; but concluded that the company, Amex Life Assurance Co., may no longer challenge coverage on the basis that an impostor took the exam.</p>
<p>In 1995, General Electric Co.'s GE Capital acquired Amex Life Assurance from American Express Co.'s travel unit.</p>
<p>Morales died of AIDS-related causes in 1993. His benefits will be paid to Slome Capital Corp., a company that purchased his policy just before he died, an attorney for Amex Life said.</p>
<p>Margaret Levy, the Amex attorney, said the insurance company was unlikely to seek a rehearing, but warned that the decision could set a dangerous precedent in the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very concerned that (the ruling) will encourage this type of fraud,&quot; Levy said.</p>
<p>Morales applied for a life insurance policy with Amex in January of 1991. At the time, he knew he was HIV-positive, the state Supreme Court said in its 20-page decision.</p>
<p>To obtain the insurance, Morales lied on the application form and sent an impostor to take the mandatory medical examination, according to the court decision.</p>
<p>Amex issued Morales a life insurance policy effective May of 1991.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death in June of 1993, he sold his policy to Slome, a company in the business of buying life insurance policies at a discount before the insured's death.</p>
<p>After Morales died, Amex discovered than an impostor had taken the medical examination and denied Slome's claim to the benefits.</p>
<p>In response, Slome sued Amex for breach of contract.</p>
<p>In court, Amex argued the so-called &quot;impostor defense,&quot; which some states recognize.</p>
<p>Under this type of defense, when a person applies for a life insurance policy and takes the medical examination but names another person as the insured, the policy does not insure the named person but, if anyone, the person who completed the application and took the exam.</p>
<p>First, the state Superior Court ruled that California does not recognize the impostor defense. Then the Court of Appeal found that the impostor defense did not apply to this case.</p>
<p>In Monday's decision, the state Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, the named insured, Morales, himself applied for the policy and did everything except take the medical examination,&quot; the state Supreme Court said. &quot;The policy insured him, not someone else.&quot;</p>
