<p>Dealers in Belgian government bonds (OLOs) and futures said the market was heading into next week's Amsterdam summit confident that the meeting would succeed and EMU and the stability pact would progress as planned.</p>
<p>&quot;We are optimistic about 'Amsterdam', but there will be swings as the politicians make statements; volatility will go up,&quot; a trader said. Meanwhile, players would hold on to their positions. &quot;Nobody is going short in this market.&quot;</p>
<p>Friday's market had seen &quot;reasonable&quot; volume, focusing on swaps of five-year paper for 10-year, both in Bunds and OLOs, in other words, flattening trades, he added.  </p>
<p>Prices recovered from early weakness due to profit-taking and position-squaring, helped by news from the U.S. that factory gate inflation in May was lower than forecast  US-ECI.</p>
<p>The U.S. producer price data confirmed that price rises in the U.S. are under control and gave the view that U.S. interest rates are to remain stable for now a firmer base.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was now set up for endorsement by EU leaders of the post-euro stability pact. &quot;The market set a course for itself...a lot has been discounted already,&quot; a trader said. Only an upset would spark a significant reaction.  </p>
<p>In contrast to earlier this week players now saw fewer and fewer reasons for pessimism that the single currency project would fail. They said that with both France and Germany keen on reaching a deal and finding a solution for France's objections to the stability pact no bad news was expected from Amsterdam.</p>
<p>&quot;Only a failure will impact the market,&quot; a trader said, &quot;that would make Bunds more attractive versus Club Med bonds.&quot;</p>
<p>An EMU collapse would spark a selloff of Italian and Spanish bonds and spread widening over Bunds. It was unclear how OLOs would fare then since Belgium's large state debt might outweigh the franc-mark link and be used as an excuse to sell OLOs too.  </p>
<p>&quot;OLOs remain driven by Bunds,&quot; an analyst said, &quot;the only attraction is the steepness of the yield curve. With the short end suggesting no rate hikes, performance will have to come from curve flattening i.e. steady, low-inflation economic data.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With the prospect of a broad EMU (with Italy and Spain) the chances of this will be limited, so we will see range-trading,&quot; he added, forecasting the 10-year OLO/Bund spread would stay in its recent 5-15 basis point range.</p>
<p>The spread was at eight basis points, unchanged from Thursday  MEUR, while the yield on the benchmark OLO  BE286= eased to 5.76 percent from 5.78, in line with Bunds.</p>
