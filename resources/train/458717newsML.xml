<p>Azerbaijani President Haydar Aliyev on Friday called off a planned trip to Pakistan, a day after the leader of Azerbaijan's breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh was named premier of neighbouring Armenia.</p>
<p>The president's press service said parliamentary speaker Murtuz Aleskerov would replace Aliyev at the summit meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Islamabad due to be held on Sunday.</p>
<p>No official reason was given for Aliyev's change of plans.</p>
<p>Political analysts suggested, however, that the cancellation was linked to Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan's surprise decision on Thursday to make Karabakh leader Robert Kocharyan the new prime minister of Armenia.</p>
<p>Karabakh, populated mostly by ethnic Armenians but within Azerbaijan's borders, broke away from Baku's rule in the late 1980s but has not been recognised by a single country.</p>
<p>The territorial dispute set off years of open war between Moslem Azeris and Christian Armenians in and around the enclave which claimed thousands of lives.</p>
<p>Armenian forces took not only all of Karabakh but eventually occupied a large stretch of Azerbaijan proper which they still hold.</p>
<p>Violence ended with the signing of a 1994 ceasefire but no peace deal has been achieved, despite international mediation.</p>
<p>There has been no official reaction from Baku on Kocharyan's appointment but some Azeri politicians and government officials have expressed dismay.</p>
<p>Western diplomats predicted it would set back regional peace efforts.</p>
