<p>An unexpected gain in U.S. new home sales in August coupled with an upward revision in July suggests strength remains in the economy supported primarily by a healthy labor market, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;This housing (sector) has nine lives; it refuses to plateau,&quot; said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp.</p>
<p>He noted that job gains have been &quot;extraordinarily strong&quot; this year. &quot;This is one of the main reasons why people are buying homes because they have jobs and income,&quot; Sohn said.  </p>
<p>Sales of new single-family homes jumped 4.7 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted, annual pace of 832,000 units, the highest since April 1986, when sales hit 857,000 units.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters, on average, expected August home sales at a 744,000 unit annual pace. July sales were revised higher to 795,000 from a previously reported 783,000.</p>
<p>Experts pointed out the strong sales persisted despite higher mortgage rates. &quot;Current mortgage rate levels even above 8.0 percent...is not enough to curtail the housing sector which the (Federal Reserve) had anticipated it would,&quot; said Evelina Tainer, chief economist at Indosuez Carr Futures.  </p>
<p>The U.S. central bank had decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged when Fed policy makers convened last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tainer noted that recent economic data has been mixed.</p>
<p>&quot;So, it's not like (the new home sales gain) says the Fed was wrong in what they did last week,&quot; she said. &quot;But, it certainly does suggest that for anybody who thinks that the Fed is going to be out for the duration, that's a wrong thought.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fed's next policy-setting meeting is scheduled for November 13.  </p>
<p>Taking a closer look at the home sales data, strength was not uniform throughout the nation as sales in the Midwest soared 28.9 percent in August, while sales dipped 13.9 percent in the Northeast.</p>
<p>William Griggs, managing director at Griggs &amp; Santow Inc, said this uneven pattern presents a &quot;dilemma&quot; for monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;That is, this economy is different depending on where you look,&quot; Griggs said. &quot;So that it's very hard to formulate a monetary policy that is appropriate for every place.&quot;</p>
