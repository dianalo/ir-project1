<p>A former South Vietnam soldier, who made history during the past week by being elected to Vietnam's National Assembly, has urged an end to animosity against Hanoi by former supporters of the U.S.-backed Saigon regime.</p>
<p>&quot;My message to them, is be patient,&quot; he said in an interview with Reuters. &quot;Now it's really far since reunification. It's been more than 20 years. It's time to look to the future.&quot;</p>
<p>Tran Thanh Trai, a surgeon who held the rank of major in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, was appointed to Vietnam's parliament following polls in mid-July in which he received the second highest vote of any candidate in Ho Chi Minh City, formally Saigon.</p>
<p>By all accounts, he had genuine popular support in a city still viewed as potentially rebellious and where 22 years after the Vietnam War ended, the bitter taste of defeat is, for many, still strong.</p>
<p>But the soft-spoken doctor -- now a prominent surgeon known for his work in separating Siamese twins -- was both cautious about referring to that past and optimistic about what his election meant for the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese who bear scars of association with the Saigon regime.</p>
<p>&quot;I think my success in the election shows the Communist Party and government have a programme for people like me, who served in the south and who accept law in the communist country, to participate,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe that.&quot;</p>
<p>Trai's appointment to Vietnam's parliament was arguably the most significant factor in last month's election for a legislature that remains still a domain of mostly anonymous party loyalists and other hand-picked deputies.</p>
<p>All but 66 people in the new 450-seat legislature are members of the ruling Communist Party. Trai was one of those 66. More significantly, he was one of only three successful candidates to have stood for election without the formal backing of the state.</p>
<p>&quot;I think in the future, the National Assembly will work very closely with what the people want,&quot; he said. &quot;And mostly the people want new laws against corruption.&quot;</p>
<p>Trai graduated from medical school in 1966 and was serving as a military surgeon at the time the war ended in 1975. He spent three years undergoing &quot;re-education&quot; at the hands of the northern victors.</p>
<p>But his success now in being elected could bring both support from his southern compatriots, and possible criticism in some quarters for having sold out to Hanoi.</p>
<p>While Vietnam has been unified for more than two decades, regionalism continues to play a strong role. Inside Vietnam, north-south dislike is often openly expressed. Communist Party officials say overseas Vietnamese groups are actively working to subvert Hanoi.</p>
<p>Trai indicated little concern about such problems and said his role as a National Assembly member would be to help bring about improved social conditions, by lobbying for a better system of health care.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people should be patient. I think improvements) in Vietnam may be slow,&quot; he said. &quot;But there will be changes.&quot;</p>
