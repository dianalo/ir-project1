<title>USA: COMEX copper ends weaker, all thoughts on stocks.</title>
<headline>COMEX copper ends weaker, all thoughts on stocks.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-14</dateline>

<p>COMEX copper settled weaker as the market became unnerved by continued attention to a report issued Wednesday that almost 600,000 tonnes of off-exchange stocks may be stored in Rotterdam, traders said.</p>
<p>Dealers were also waiting for Friday's LME stock report, with a further drawdown expected by many.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Long Beach stocks may continue lower, and a lot of that is being consumed, going directly to fill rod and cathode requirements in the U.S.,&quot; said Rich Hirsch of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Another broker expected the LME three-months price to remain volatile, along with the cash to three-months premium or backwardation, because of the shorts in the market.</p>
<p>December COMEX settled 2.05 cents weaker at 95.85 cents per pound, traded 97.15 to 95.50 cents. Spot October went out 2.15 cents lower at 96.65 cents. Volume was estimated at 9,500 lots compared to Wednesday's official 11,084 lots.</p>
<p>COMEX stocks on Thursday rose 376 short tons to 32,750 short tons. Metal entered Baltimore on Tuesday and Wednesday, but there was no increase Thursday.</p>
<p>There was talk that several thousand tons of metal had arrived in Baltimore from  Europe following arbitrage deals.</p>
