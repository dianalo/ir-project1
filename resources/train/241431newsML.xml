<headline>F.O. LICHT - Daily coffee report.</headline>

<p>The following is a direct contribution from statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920.</p>
<p>COFFEE: World market for December 5, 1996</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London closed easier across the board on prospects of larger robusta supplies in 1996/97. January lost $11 to close at $1,311, while March gave up $25 to close $1,248. In New York arabica futures remained on the defensive with modest losses posted across the board. December gave up 35 points to close at 112.45 cents/lb, while March closed 75 points easier at 103.45 cents/lb. December has another six trading days before it expires and thus far deliveries remain at zero.</p>
<p>There continues to be much uncertainty about the size of the 1997/98 Brazilian crop with estimates about as wide spread as they can get. While some believe that the crop could be as low as 17.8 million bags, others said it could exceed 30 million bags up from around 27 million bags in 1996/97 and 12.5 million bags in 1995/96. In other news, Brazilian coffee exporter UNICAFE said the country's carry over stocks in private hands could be as low as 39,000 bags at the end of 1996/97 (July/June), down sharply from the 876,000 bags carried over from 1995/96. The market's direction will largely depend on news of Brazil's 1997/98 crop and traders face a period of uncertainty.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>MEXICO - Mexico coffee production in 1996/97 (Oct/Sept) could reach 4.5 to 5.0 million 60-kg bags, down from 5.4 million bags produced in 1995/96, industry sources said. The fall this season is ascribed to the natural crop cycle in which a good year is traditionally followed by a bad year. This report is in contrast to the USDA's expectation which is for a moderate rise in Mexican coffee production and would suggest an increase in export availability rather than a decline.</p>
<p>COLOMBIA - Colombia cut its internal coffee price by 14,000 pesos per 125 kg load on December 5 in order to rescue the coffee fund from a financial disaster. With the price cut, effective December 6, growers who have been paid 235,500 pesos per 125 kg load since August 25 will now receive 221,500 pesos.</p>
<p>PORTUGAL - Portugal imported 56,162 bags of coffee in August 1996 nearly 20 percent more than was imported the same month the previous year. That brought total imports since the beginning of 1996 up to 503,100 bags, 26 percent more than was imported the same period in 1995. Total imports in calendar year 1995 dropped by 5 percent to 629,600 bags. Major suppliers of green coffee in January/August 1996 were Ivory Coast (74,400 vs 51,400 bags) and Brazil (63,600 vs 55,700 bags). The country exported 62,900 bags of coffee in January/August 1996, 36 percent more than was exported the same period in 1995. Total exports in calendar year 1995 rose to 74,000 bags from 52,100 bags in 1994.</p>
<p>ROMANIA - Romania imported 254,800 bags of coffee in January/August 1996 sharply up on last year's figure of 121,800 bags. Total imports in calendar year 1995, however, fell sharply to 243,200 bags from 399,700 bags in 1994. The main supplier of green coffee in January/August 1996 was Indonesia with 116,100 bags up from 3,900 bags the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>TANZANIA - Tanzania exported 91,500 bags of coffee in July/September 1996 sharply down on last year's figure of 132,500 bags. Total exports in crop year 1995/96 reached 934,800 bags up from 611,900 bags exported the previous year. The main export markets in July/September 1996 were Germany (13,000 vs 21,900 bags), the Netherlands (12,800 vs 18,300 bags) and Japan (18,300 vs 20,600 bags).</p>
