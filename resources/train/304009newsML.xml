<p>A member of a Swedish motorcycle gang was wounded by gunshots early on Monday, two days after a Hells Angels biker was shot dead in Denmark, police said.</p>
<p>Police were called after gunshots were heard from a house in Odakra, near the southern Swedish town of Helsingborg, and a man was taken to hospital with shoulder wounds.</p>
<p>It was the second incident involving biker gangs this weekend, raising fears that a Nordic biker war could flare up again.</p>
<p>&quot;But we don't know yet if the two events have any connection,&quot; police spokesman Leif Nilsson told national news agency TT.</p>
<p>Over the past three years eight people have been killed in Sweden, Denmark and Norway in fights between the rival Hells Angels and Bandidos biker gangs, both offshoots of U.S. bike clans.</p>
<p>Overnight on Friday 26-year-old Hells Angels member, Kim Svendsen, was shot dead in the Danish town of Aalborg in the north of the Jutland peninsula.</p>
<p>After police raids on homes of known members of the rival Bandidos gang in and around Aalborg, 14 people were detained for questioning.</p>
