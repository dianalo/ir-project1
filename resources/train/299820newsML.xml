<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>The at times delicate relations between Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and the Fed's regional banks were highlighted Thursday in transcripts of the central bank's deliberations in 1991.</p>
<p>The transcripts, released on Thursday with the usual five-year lag, show Greenspan being accused early in 1991 of sidestepping the regional banks by sanctioning a cut in interest rates.  </p>
<p>But as the year wore on, the two sides grew closer together as the central bank struggled to revive the economy from the 1990/91 Gulf War recession by repeatedly cutting short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>Fed watchers say that the regional Fed Bank chiefs often, but not always, take a tougher line against inflation than the central bank's chairman, making them more reluctant to cut rates and more eager to raise them.  </p>
<p>That seemed to be the case late last year, when eight of the 12 reserve banks asked the Washington-based central bank board to approve an increase in the discount rate, which the Fed charges commercial banks for loans.</p>
<p>Greenspan, though, resisted such a move, arguing that the economy would cool off on its own without the need for tighter credit. He turned out to be correct.</p>
<p>Greenspan looks to have run into some problems with the regional bank presidents back in 1991 when the board cut the discount rate by a half percentage point on Feb. 1 and then allowed the federal funds to fall by a like amount.  </p>
<p>Although the board determines the discount rate, the fed funds rate -- the rate which commercial banks charge each other for money -- is set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which includes the presidents of the regional banks.</p>
<p>By allowing the half point cut in the discount rate by the board to &quot;show through&quot; to the fed funds rate, Greenspan opened himself up to accusations that he was sidestepping the regional bank presidents.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think you've been unusually good in calling us together, but there have been one or two instances where I wished we had gotten together and we didn't,&quot; former Richmond Fed President Robert Black told Greenspan at an FOMC meeting on March 26, 1991.</p>
<p>Black reported that one of his colleaques -- he did not say who -- called him after the Feb. 1 rate cut and said, &quot;You've just been disenfranchised on your vote.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;He felt very strongly that that (rate cut) had precluded the FOMC from determining the federal funds rate, which he thought was the province of the FOMC,&quot; Black said. &quot;And I can understand that argument,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Perhaps in deference to such feelings, Greenspan held off from cutting interest rates in mid-April of 1991 as many of the reserve bank presidents voiced caution about such a move despite growing market expectations of a Fed ease.</p>
<p>By the end of that month, however, Greenspan and the Fed went ahead with a rate cut.</p>
<p>Later in the year, the regional presidents began to become more concerned about the economy's failure to rebound from the recession, leading former Fed Governor Wayne Angell to joke at one point about their increasing doveishness.</p>
<p>The central bank ended 1991 with a swingeing cut in interest rates, chopping the fed funds rate by a half point and the discount rate by a full percentage point in an attempt to revive confidence in the economy.</p>
