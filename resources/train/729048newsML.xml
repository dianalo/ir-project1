<p>Kuwaiti MPs on Tuesday questioned the country's finance minister over alleged corruption in state financial institutions.</p>
<p>MP Ahmad al-Mulaifi and two other opposition MPs had submitted a parliamentary request to ask minister Nasser al-Rodhan about alleged violations by institutions that fall under his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Sami al-Munayes, a member of the liberal Kuwait Democratic Forum (KDF) opposition grouping and one of the MPs who signed the request, lisited a number of financial transactions which allegedly cost the state tens of millions of dollars since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Some political sources doubted a vote of no-confidence would follow Tuesday's debates due to lack of wide support for such a move which requires the vote of 24 of 46 elected MPs.</p>
<p>The questioning of the minister, the 12th since Kuwait's first parliament in 1963, is the first of a cabinet minister by the parliament which was elected in October. The last questioning was held in 1995.</p>
<p>Rodhan was made finance minister in the oil-rich, welfare state shortly after the war, which followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He chairs the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), which manages the state's foreign investments of more than $40 billion, the Central Bank and Kuwait Airways.</p>
<p>Munayes claimed that corruption was rampant in financial institutions due to lack of measures to montior public funds and failure to conduct adequate checks when appointing officials in charge of state funds.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no desire to implement laws,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The minister will respond to the charges during Tuesday's session in which three other MPs will address parliament in his support.</p>
<p>The government has backed Rodhan, who also enjoys the support of some pro-government MPs while liberal and Moslem Shi'ite groupings appear ready to push for a no-confidence vote.</p>
<p>Other groupings have said they would decide their final position after listening to Rodhan's response to the charges.</p>
<p>Kuwait, the only Gulf Arab state with an elected parliament, has no political parties</p>
