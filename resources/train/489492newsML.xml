<p>finance minister Theo Waigel said that all outstanding points on the stability pact aimed at ensuring budget discipoline within monetary union had been resolved after talks with other EU finance ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;We succeeded in coming to a good solution,&quot; Waigel told a news briefing at the meeting of the bloc's 15 ministers and central bank heads in the Dutch coastal resort of Noordwijk.  </p>
<p>Waigel said the ministers had agreed that any country which sustained a deficit of more than three percent of Gross Domestic Product for more than one year could be eligible to paying a fine of more than 0.5 percent of its GDP.</p>
<p>Talks on the stability pact in Dublin late last year had set a maximum limit of 0.5 percent for any fine paid, but had not specified exactly what period this would cover.</p>
<p>Waigel also said that any fine which a member country would be required to pay if it did not take action to correct its deficit position would be used &quot;to the benefit of good EMU members&quot;.</p>
<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, commenting on the finance ministers' conclusion, said he was pleased that the decision had been reached with very little controversy.</p>
<p>He added that the most important issue was to define the &quot;norm&quot; -- that a country should run a balanced budget or, in the case of those with a high level of debt, a surplus.</p>
