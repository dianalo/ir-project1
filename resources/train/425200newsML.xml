<p>Amcol Holdings bondholders may not receive payments for at least a year after the listing of a new company taking over the troubled property and trading group, a source close to the bondholders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Price Waterhouse, the judicial managers of Amcol, last year selected Indonesia's Sinar Mas group to rescue Amcol through an injection of at least US$2.0 billion of assets.</p>
<p>A new company named Golden Amcol, also referred to as Newco, would be formed under a share exchange. Golden Amcol would also seek a listing on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.</p>
<p>The source, close to the holders of Singapore $285 million of Amcol bonds, told Reuters Sinar Mas has proposed &quot;an extension of time of not less than 12 months from the date on which Newco shares are listed&quot; for the repayment on the principle amount of bonds.</p>
<p>According to the source, Sinar Mas has the option to repay bondholders earlier than the stipulated time.</p>
<p>Bondholders would have to waive penalty interest rates for late payment, he said.  </p>
<p>Holders of two bonds worth S$170 million, secured against Amcol's property Orchard Towers, would be paid earlier if the property was sold, the source said.</p>
<p>Amcol's bondholders had been fighting for a guarantee from Sinar Mas. Their petition to block appointment of the judicial managers was rejected by the High Court in August.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the custodian of the bonds, HSBC Trustees, informed holders of Amcol's three sets of bonds -- expiring in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively -- through newspaper advertisements that they could obtain a paper explaining the Sinar Mas proposal.</p>
<p>A meeting will be held on March 10 to seek preliminary views of bondholders, the advertisements said.</p>
<p>Another meeting, to seek approval from the bondholders, would be held on April 1, the source said.</p>
<p>According to the daily Straits Times (ST) newspaper on Thursday, trade creditors of an Amcol subsidiary have been given interim payments.</p>
<p>The creditor banks of Amcol unit Sankei have been receiving 35 cents for every dollar of the S$140 million they are owed, subject to certain conditions, banking sources told ST.</p>
<p>Sankei's creditors have been paid out of surplus cash from sale of stocks belonging to the trading subsidiary, the ST said.</p>
<p>Amcol's judicial managers and lawyers were not immediately available for comment.</p>
