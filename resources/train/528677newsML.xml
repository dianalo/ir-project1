<p>The Indian rupee ended Tuesday at 35.75/76 per dollar, up from opening quotes of 35.76/77 despite Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervention, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the rupee shrugged off central bank intervention and moved up after dipping briefly to 35.78.</p>
<p>&quot;The RBI intervention was not enough to hold the rupee back,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;It (RBI) was briefly in the market in early interbank trade, buying dollars between 35.76 and 35.77.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the RBI intervened as the rupee was looking to move up through the 35.75 mark.</p>
<p>They said the rupee traded at a high of 35.75 and a low of 35.78 on Tuesday and that 35.76-35.7650 was the most actively traded range.</p>
<p>Dealers said poor dollar demand was the prime reason behind the rupee's strength and said the rupee was unlikely to weaken unless import demand picked up.</p>
<p>&quot;That (import demand) will be the key factor,&quot; said a dealer at a satte-run bank. &quot;Unless that picks up, even small inflows will push the rupee up.&quot;</p>
<p>In the forward market, premiums continued to fall on a combination of poor demand, good domestic liquidity and expectations of low interest rates.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rupee ended up against the forward dollar after dropping in morning trade.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some buying of forward dollars when the RBI hit the spot market,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;October dollars went up 90 paise but selling at higher levels soon brough the rupee back.&quot;</p>
<p>October-delivery dollars were quoted at a premium of 84/86 paise against opening quotes of 88/91.</p>
