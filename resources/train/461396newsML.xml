<p>Gauteng Lions secured a fourth successive Super 12 rugby union victory on Saturday when they beat New South Wales 36-27 in a thrilling battle.</p>
<p>The Lions, until a week ago known as Transvaal, had seen a 24-6 lead turn into a two point deficit 15 minutes into the second half.</p>
<p>Lions full-back Gavin Johnson hauled the hosts back into the lead with his fifth penalty to make it 29-27 with 18 minutes remaining.</p>
<p>It stayed that way until the 80th minute as both sides went close to scoring before Lions scrum half Johan Roux crowned a fine game by diving over from close range to make it 36-27.</p>
<p>Johnson converted to crown another fine evening for the number 15. He was successful with seven out of eight kicks at goal to add to his first-half try in a personal haul of 26 points and he has now scored 87 points in four Super 12 games.</p>
<p>The win kept Gauteng Lions on top of the standings but they had to weather a ferocious comeback from the Waratahs after they appeared to have run the Australians out of the match in the first half.</p>
<p>Full-back Matthew Burke had kept NSW in touch by kicking two penalties to Johnson's four to make it 12-6 after 28 minutes.</p>
<p>But converted tries from Lions skipper and lock Kobus Wiese -- driving on to Roux's pass -- and from Johnson -- after a break from his own half by Springbok centre Japie Mulder -- left the visitors reeling at 26-6.</p>
<p>They showed great character to respond before the interval with a try from winger Alistair Murdoch after a superb break by powerful centre Graeme Bond. Burke converted to it make it 26-13 at half time.</p>
<p>Further tries from number eight Fili Finau after a break by the impressive Matt Burke and from flanker Stuart Pinkerton after sustained pressure took NSW into the lead after 55 minutes.</p>
<p>At that point they looked capable of ending the Lions' unbeaten start to the season but they were unable to extend the lead.</p>
<p>Johnson kicked his side back into the lead with a 62nd minute penalty and it was the home side who finished the stronger before a crowd of 22,000.</p>
<p>The Lions' will expect to maintain their 100 per cent start with a home match against Wellington on Saturday.</p>
