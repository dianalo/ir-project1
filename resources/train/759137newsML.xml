<p>Zimbabwe's short-term money rates were quoted mixed in quiet trade in Monday's market, local dealers said.</p>
<p>The market opened with an unsettled surplus of Z$110 million but dealers said the central Reserve Bank opted not to auction any treasury bills on Monday since there were no maturities to boost liquidity to substantial levels.</p>
<p>However the central bank bills were being sold on the secondary market at an average rate of 24.75 percent, slightly lower than Friday's 24.80 percent while call money edged up to 24 percent from a 22 to 23 percentage range.</p>
<p>NCDs with maturity of 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought unchanged at 26.5 percent but sold firmer at 26 percent from between 25 and 25.5 percent previously. Bankers acceptances eased to 25.5 percent from 25.75 (buying) but were quoted firmer on the selling side at 25 percent compared to Friday's 24.75 percent.</p>
