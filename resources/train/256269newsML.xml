<p>Swedish bonds were the best performers in a week in which most government bonds crumbled under a catalogue of woes, according to data from Salomon Brothers on Friday.</p>
<p>Comments from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about the speculative nature of market rallies sent bonds tumbling last Friday. The sell-off continued this week amid talk the Japanese would begin to stop buying U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Benign U.S. inflation data on Wednesday and Thursday helped stem losses but the overall Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index ended up 0.50 percent in the red in local terms.</p>
<p>In U.S. dollar terms, the index was off 0.33 percent.</p>
<p>The only bond markets to end in the black in local terms were Sweden with a 0.21 percent gain and Canada ending 0.01 percent ahead. In U.S. dollar terms Sweden was 0.23 percent ahead and Canada 0.12 percent.</p>
<p>Spain and Switzerland ended flat in the week in local terms and ahead 0.53 percent and 0.29 percent respectively in dollars.</p>
<p>Finland was next in line registering a 0.21 percent loss in local terms, followed by Denmark with a 0.22 percent decline, Germany with a 0.24 percent drop and Belgium off 0.32 percent.</p>
<p>Other European countries dipped further, with the Netherlands down half a point in the week, Italy contracting 0.56 percent, France off 0.58 percent and British gilts, also pounded by political concerns, slumped 0.61 percent.</p>
<p>Treasuries were down 0.59 percent in the week, and Australian bonds off 0.36 percent. Japanese government bonds lost 0.67 percent in yen and a chunky 1.39 percent in dollar terms.</p>
<p>In dollar terms, the big winner was gilts, ahead 1.27 percent.</p>
<p>Salomon's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity, weighted for market capitalisation. Only bonds freely available to institutional investors and with a certain minimum amount outstanding are included. Returns take account of price moves and accrued interest.</p>
