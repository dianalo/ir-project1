<p>A Singapore opposition politician on Friday won the right to be represented by a top British lawyer in a case brought against him by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like a million dollars right now. Now the champagne can flow,&quot; Joshua Jeyaretnam told reporters after the ruling.</p>
<p>Justice Chao Hick Tin ruled after lengthy submissions and two adjournments that top libel lawyer George Carman could represent Workers' Party leader Jeyaretnam.</p>
<p>Chao said he was satisfied the case involved issues of &quot;sufficient complexity and difficulty&quot; to require the admission of a Queen's Counsel, a senior barrister, to act for Jeyaretnam.</p>
<p>Davinder Singh, counsel for Lee, opposed the request, saying the case could be handled by local lawyers, that the extra costs were not expected to be recovered by Lee if he won his suit, and that the veteran opposition leader was seeking special treatment.</p>
<p>Jeyaretnam is being sued by Lee over comments he is alleged to have made at a political rally on January 1, the day before Singapore's general election, which returned the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to power with 81 of 83 parlimentary seats.</p>
<p>Jeyaretnam is alleged to have suggested that Lee, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and other senior PAP members were guilty of criminal defamation and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Eight law suits stemmed from the comments, but the application to have Carman admitted was made only in relation to the case brought by Lee.</p>
<p>Lee was Singapore's prime minister from 1959 to 1990.</p>
<p>Jeyaretnam lost in this year's election but still entered parliament under a provision allowing the &quot;best loser&quot; into the legislative body.</p>
