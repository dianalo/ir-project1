<p>A fierce debate in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government over the proposed single European currency could cause irreparable harm to the centre-right coalition, Germany's Free Democrats (FDP) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt and other FDP leaders decried the persistent hardline warnings against any relaxation of the criteria for the euro from Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber, a leading figure in the Christian Social Union (CSU).</p>
<p>German editorial writers also took aim at Stoiber, whose indefatigable warnings about meeting strict fiscal criteria for Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU) have drawn strong rebukes from Kohl and leaders in his Christian Democrats (CDU).</p>
<p>Stoiber has opposed CDU leaders, insisting on strict interpretation of the Maastricht Treaty outlining economic criteria for EMU. The CSU is the sister party to Kohl's CDU.</p>
<p>&quot;This could cause damage to the coalition in the long run,&quot; said Guido Westerwelle, general secretary of the FDP. &quot;Stoiber is not interested in the stability of the euro. He is more interested in his chances for the next Bavarian elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Though the FDP and CSU share power in Bonn with Kohl's CDU, the centrist FDP and Stoiber's arch-conservative CSU have clashed over numerous issues in the past.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Gerhardt, the FDP chairman, said Stoiber was only stirring uncertainty with his remarks rather than creating the stability he says he wants.</p>
<p>Gerhardt said the FDP wanted to ensure Germany's deficit did not exceed the Maastricht Treaty's aim of three percent of gross domestic product but added, &quot;no one could say the euro would be less stable if the deficit is slightly above this level.&quot;</p>
<p>Rexrodt warned the debate could damage business.</p>
<p>&quot;From the view of the German economy, a renewed delay debate is dangerous,&quot; said Rexrodt. &quot;The German business sector must be able to rely on the start date to be able to make the necessary preparations for the currency change-over on time.&quot;</p>
<p>Pressure on Stoiber also grew from Kohl's CDU, which rarely criticises its Bavarian sister party in public.</p>
<p>CDU general secretary Peter Hintze said stability criteria should not be pit against the timetable for introducing the euro. He said that debate was counterproductive.</p>
<p>&quot;The stability criteria as the anchor of the EMU will remain firmly in place and are irrevocable,&quot; Hintze said before a meeting of CDU leaders in Berlin. &quot;The euro will start on time.&quot;</p>
<p>Oskar Lafontaine, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), said the hardline insistence of holding the budget deficit to three percent of GDP was &quot;economic nonsense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This fetish for 3.0 is economic nonsense,&quot; he said. &quot;If the project failed, it would be a setback for European unity.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ifo economic research institute said it expects EMU to start on time, but most countries will not fulfil all criteria. Ifo said nearly all European states, including Germany, France and Italy, will miss at least one of the criteria.</p>
<p>Many German newspaper editorial writers said Stoiber's anti-euro campaign had little to do with the single currency.</p>
<p>The populist premier's stance had more to do with raising his own personal political profile and showing his CSU party standing up to Kohl in Bonn ahead of state elections next year.</p>
<p>The Frankfurter Rundschau said Stoiber was likely to stick to his stance. &quot;He won't simply knuckle under just because Helmut Kohl wrinkles his brow in annoyance,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>The liberal daily warned of danger for Kohl if he decided not to rigidly apply deficit criteria rules.</p>
<p>&quot;Stoiber would mobilise the CSU against this and presumably, find a clear majority in favour of his stance,&quot; it predicted. &quot;That would mean the end of the coalition in Bonn.&quot;</p>
