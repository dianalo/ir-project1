<dateline>GREENWICH, Conn.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tenneco Inc. on Tuesday reported higher earnings for the second quarter, buoyed by strong results from its automotive and speciality packaging units.</p>
<p>It posted net income from continuing operations of $104 million, or 61 cents a share, vs. year-earlier earnings of $88 million, or 52 cents a share.</p>
<p>Total revenues increased 12 percent to $1.9 billion from $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;In the second quarter, two of our businesses, automotive and speciality packaging, already industry leaders, set records for both earnings and revenue, exceeding even our high expectations,&quot; Chairman Dana G. Mead said.</p>
<p>&quot;In our other business, recent improvements in containerboard industry conditions, notably pricing, combined with our stringent cost-control measures, give us good reason to believe we have turned the corner in that business,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The automotive unit's operating income rose 26 percent to $131 million from $104 million a year ago. Revenues increased 12 percent to $873 million from $780 million, setting a quarter-over-quarter record for the 15th straight time, it said.</p>
<p>The packaging division had operating income of $82 million vs. a year-ago income of $100 million, which excluded a $50 million gain from the sale of a paperboard mill joint venture with Caraustar Industries.</p>
<p>Tenneco's stock was up $1.81 at $47.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
