<p>Argentine soccer club River Plate on Friday struck off its list of &quot;honorary members&quot; the leaders of Argentina's 1976-83 military regime, including former Gen. Jorge Videla and Adm. Emilio Massera.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the best homage River can make to the victims of the military dictatorship,&quot; said Alfredo Bravo, a member of Congress and an ardent River fan who detected the &quot;Dirty War&quot; leaders' names on club lists and demanded their removal.</p>
<p>Videla and Massera were members of the first military junta after the 1976 coup against the elected government of Isabel Peron. They waged a &quot;Dirty War&quot; against suspected leftists in which tens of thousands of people &quot;disappeared&quot; -- abducted, tortured and killed by the military.</p>
<p>Bravo, who came across a 1979 club edict giving the heads of the regime honorary membership of Argentina's second most popular club, said River Plate members voted unanimously to kick out the former junta leaders, who were tried and jailed in the 1980s but granted a pardon in 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe we have to give words back their meaning. These characters cannot be honorary members if they have been condemned by the courts,&quot; Bravo told Reuters.</p>
<p>Videla led the March 1976 coup that overthrew Isabel Peron and was president for the bloodiest years of repression, while Massera was behind the most infamous clandestine torture centre of the Dirty War, the Navy School of Mechanics (ESMA).</p>
