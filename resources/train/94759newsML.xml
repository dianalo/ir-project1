<title>USA: Parretti found guilty of perjury.</title>

<p>A Delaware jury Wednesday found Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, the former chief of Hollywood movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, guilty of evidence tampering and perjury.</p>
<p>The charges, brought by the state of Delaware, stemmed from a 1991 trial here in which the Italian financier's ouster as head of the movie studio was confirmed. Parretti showed no obvious reaction to the decision on Wednesday by the jury.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old Parretti faces a maximum sentence of 10 years. Delaware Superior Court Judge Richard Cooch set sentencing for Nov. 18, after a presentencing investigation report has been completed. Parretti remains free on $100,000 bail.</p>
<p>Since he returned voluntarily last October from his home in Italy to face charges in Delaware, Parretti has been living in California where he has sued the bank for $3.9 billion for allegedly conspiring to defraud him of MGM.</p>
<p>Parretti is also subject to extradition to France to face eight counts of fraud, theft and embezzlement related to his ownership of MGM and his dealings with French state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais and Europe Image Distribution, a French associate of MGM.</p>
<p>In Delaware, state Deputy Attorney General Paul Wallace told reporters &quot;this is an incredibly dangerous crime and it could have meant financial disaster for what is an institution (MGM).&quot;</p>
<p>Parretti, accompanied by his daughter, Valentina and two former employees who testified earlier this week, declined to comment.</p>
<p>However, his attorney, Jay Coggan, said, &quot;I don't think there was enough evidence to reach this verdict. It always surprises me when juries convict on circumstances and not real, direct evidence.&quot;</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for about seven hours on Tuesday and Wednesday before reaching a verdict.</p>
<p>Another Parretti attorney, Eugene Maurer, said attorneys will look into a possibility of requesting a new trial and that there will be an appeal of the decision after the Nov. 18 sentencing.</p>
<p>The verdict represented another chapter in the financial saga centred on MGM, a 72-year-old studio with a golden past and a distinctive roaring lion trademark.</p>
<p>In 1990, Parretti's Pathe Communications acquired the studio for $1.3 billion from billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian -- who bought the studio in 1981 and sold it to Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. five years later, only to buy back all of the assets except the film library several months later.</p>
<p>Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, the Dutch affiliate of the French bank, financed the Parretti deal but ousted him in 1991 as part of a rescue package to save the studio.</p>
<p>In the December 1991 trial, a Delaware judge upheld Parretti's ouster by the bank. Parretti was indicted by a grand jury in Delaware in 1992 after attorneys for the bank alleged to the Delaware attorney general that Parretti had testified falsely in the trial about a document he had altered to appear to have been faxed to him.</p>
<p>The bank took ownership of the studio in 1992 after Parretti defaulted on loans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kerkorian came back a third time for the studio in July, taking part in a $1.3 billion management-led buyout of the studio from a French state-owned holding company formed to dispose of some of the assets of troubled Credit Lyonnais.</p>
