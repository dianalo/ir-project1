<p>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) and Phillips Petroleum Co are close to deciding on details of a A$1.0 billion-plus liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant proposed for Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory.</p>
<p>BHP and Phillips were discussing the options for development of the proposed plant and it was expected an understanding would be produced by the end of the first quarter of 1997, Malcolm Garratt, senior external affairs adviser for BHP Petroleum, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>In recent interviews with Reuters in Darwin, Northern Territory ministers also expressed optimism that the proposed plant would go ahead.</p>
<p>The two main options for the project involve either an onshore LNG plant, with a 470 km pipeline to bring the gas from the Timor Sea, and an offshore plant.</p>
<p>Plant capacity would be about three million tonnes of LNG a year, but it was preliminary to talk of cost, Garratt said.</p>
<p>LNG plants generally cost more than A$1.0 billion, he said. Previous reports have put the cost of the plant at A$1.9 billion.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will be meeting with Phillips toward the end of the first quarter, hopefully to make a decision,&quot; Garratt said.</p>
<p>Phillips has favoured an onshore plant while BHP has favoured an offshore plant.</p>
<p>The proposals, one of several big infrastructure plans in Darwin, Australia's northernmost capital, are for the development of the Bayu-Undan gas and liquids discovery in the Timor Sea.</p>
<p>It straddles two permits in the Zone of Co-operation (ZOCA) between Indonesia and Australia.  </p>
<p>BHP Petroleum holds 42.42 percent of ZOCA 91-12 permit, with the remainder held by Santos Ltd, 21.43 percent, Indonesia's Inpex Sahul Ltd, 21.21 percent and Petroz NL, 14.94 percent.</p>
<p>The adjacent ZOCA 91-13 permit is operated by Phillips, which holds 60 percent. Oryx Energy Co of the U.S. has 25 percent and Britain's Hardy Oil &amp; Gas Plc 15 percent. The proposed LNG plant is one of several big infrastructure projects currently proposed for the Northern Territory, including a A$1 billion railway from Darwin to Alice Springs.</p>
