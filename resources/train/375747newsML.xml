<p>With stampeding bulls continuing to push the dollar towards the key 125 yen barrier, currency experts noted mounting concern that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may intervene to curb the rally, particularly when Tokyo trading gets underway.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody fears about BOJ intervention around 125 the figure,&quot; said Takayuki Ishikawa, assistant vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd. &quot;But especially in New York time, I don't think they can do intervention.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ishikawa added that he could see the dollar hitting 125 yen in the Tokyo market on Friday.</p>
<p>The greenback surged briefly to 124.66 yen in U.S. trade on Thursday, its highest level since the Group of Seven (G7) major powers last Saturday issued a statement declaring that &quot;major misalignments&quot; in exchange markets cited in its April 1995 communique have been corrected.</p>
<p>The dollar had tumbled to a post-World War II low of 79.75 yen on April 19, 1995.</p>
<p>Both the G7 and later Japan's Ministry of Finance vowed to monitor currency markets and take appropriate actions.  </p>
<p>&quot;The central banks and governments seem to have set themselves up in a situation where, to save face, they are going to have to make some kind of material effort to cap the dollar,&quot; said Ron Leven, currency strategist at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>Leven said the BOJ is more likely to intervene during Tokyo trading than in New York time.</p>
<p>If the dollar went above 125 yen in New York and the BOJ did not intervene, the market would not perceive a lack of concern at the BOJ, Leven said.</p>
<p>However, he said, &quot;If we trade in Tokyo above 125 and we don't see them, then that's a more significant signal.&quot;</p>
