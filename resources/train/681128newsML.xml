<p>Turkish prime minister-designate Mesut Yilmaz said on Monday he saw no chance of failure in his bid to form a secularist coalition to keep the Islamists out of power.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible for a compromise government that excludes the (Islamist) Welfare Party not to win a vote of confidence,&quot; Yilmaz told a news conference.  </p>
<p>He was speaking after a meeting of his conservative Motherland Party to map out strategy for his bid to forge an anti-Islamist coalition. He is to meet leaders of four political parties on Tuesday for talks on setting up a new government.</p>
<p>Istanbul shares jumped eight percent on hopes free-marketeer Yilmaz would overcome the obstacles in the way of forming a coalition, brokers said.</p>
<p>Yilmaz is around a dozen votes short of the simple majority he would need to win a confidence vote. He is opposed by a pro-Islamic alliance that has 282 votes in the 550-seat chamber.</p>
<p>President Suleyman Demirel last week nominated Yilmaz to put together a government after the resignation of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, who resigned after months of open criticism from the secularist army.</p>
