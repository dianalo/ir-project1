<p>South Korean prosecutors and management of giant industrial conglomerates launched a legal assault on militant labour union leaders to try to crush strikes that flared anew on Monday.</p>
<p>As many as 190,000 workers joined the latest wave of industrial action following a respite over New Year holidays, idling car plants and shipbuilding yards.</p>
<p>Hospital and broadcast unions were poised to join them.</p>
<p>Riot police fired teargas as more than 10,000 workers marched through Seoul to show their anger at a new labour bill and the latest attempts to quash union resistance to the legislation.</p>
<p>After trying conciliation to end stoppages that have crippled export industries, leading employers' groups squared off for a bruising battle with leaders of the outlawed Korean Confederation of Trade Unions.</p>
<p>Employers vowed to sue individual leaders over production losses they put at 340 billion won ($403 million) from strikes so far.</p>
<p>Media reports said the employers were contemplating lockouts and bringing in replacement workers.</p>
<p>State prosecutors summoned about 20 confederation leaders for questioning over the strikes, which began the day the labour bill was railroaded through parliament and have since been declared illegal.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said unionists risked arrest if they did not turn up.</p>
<p>Kwon Young-kil, president of the umbrella union body that claims membership of 500,000 workers, rejected the summons and threatened to escalate strikes unless President Kim Young-sam announced the repeal of the new bill at a news conference scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
<p>There was no sign the government would back down over legislation it says is vital to ensure South Korean industry maintains its international competitive edge.</p>
<p>The law shatters decades of near total job security by allowing employers to lay off workers, hire temporary staff and replace strikers.</p>
<p>Kwon, a fiery orator who shaved his head in an act of defiance, was camped out with fellow union bosses in a makeshift tent pitched on the snow-covered grounds of Seoul's Roman Catholic Myongdong Cathedral.</p>
<p>Huddled around a gas stove for warmth, they directed the strikes with portable telephones.</p>
<p>The confederation claimed 190,000 workers at 150 unions joined Monday's stoppages.</p>
<p>Hyundai Motor Co and 12 other units of South Korea's most powerful industrial conglomerate, including its shipyard, were shut after unions ordered almost 75,000 workers to join an indefinite walkout.</p>
<p>Production lines were also halted at Daewoo Motor Co Ltd, Kia Motors and Ssangyong Motor Co</p>
<p>Hospital workers who had earlier given up strike action said they would return to the fray on Tuesday along with unions from the country's three big television broadcasters.</p>
<p>Unions representing securities industry workers called members out from Wednesday.</p>
<p>The confederation's larger counterpart, the Korean Federation of Trade Unions with 1.2 million members, said its leaders would meet on Thursday to plot their next move. Earlier, the federation said it would resume industrial action on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kwon accused the government of trying to divert public attention from the industrial unrest by provoking a showdown with the unions.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the government's strong response we will push on with our strikes and we won't back down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Workers marching in Seoul chanted &quot;Overthrow Kim Young-sam&quot; in the third straight day of protest rallies in the capital.</p>
<p>Stocks tumbled on fears that action against unions could further inflame some of the worst industrial unrest since the late 1980s and lead to serious clashes. The leading index closed down 2.5 percent.</p>
