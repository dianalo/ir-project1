<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan February foreign currency deposits rise.</title>
<headline>Taiwan February foreign currency deposits rise.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-03-27</dateline>

<p>Taiwan's outstanding foreign currency deposits rose to T$335.882 billion at end-February from T$326.8 billion a month earlier, the central bank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The central bank said in a statement the rise was mainly due to a continued trade surplus, which stood at US$205.8 million in February.  </p>
<p>Deposits have reached high levels recently because exporters, seeking to limit risk in exchanging foreign currency, have gradually shifted to paying for raw material imports directly with foreign currency rather than Taiwan dollars, central bank officials said.</p>
<p>Foreign currency deposits began rising in mid-1995 as political frictions between Taiwan and China intensified.</p>
<p>China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, mounted war games and missile tests in waters near the island in the second half of 1995 and early 1996 in a warning against moves to pursue the island's independence.  </p>
<p>Tensions in the months before Taiwan's historic direct presidential election in March 1996 also sparked a run on the U.S. currency, big cash outflows and sharp rises in foreign exchange holdings.</p>
<p>Central bank officials had said that the capital outflows were not as serious as feared because much of the capital that was exchanged into foreign currency during the crisis stayed in Taiwan deposits.</p>
