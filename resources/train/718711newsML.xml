<p>Canadian oil and gas stocks took a drubbing on Thursday after Renaissance Energy Ltd., one of the country's top energy firms, shocked investors with a reduced forecast of its 1997 oil production.</p>
<p>The lower forecast, which Renaissance's chief executive admitted should have been revealed last month, called into question other companies' ability to meet production targets this year and sent a chill through the sector, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The leader of the Canadian oil and gas scene has drafted back its numbers and it's causing everybody to question the volume estimates of all the companies,&quot; said FirstEnergy Capital Corp. analyst Martin Molyneaux.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody's kind of shaken up by it. Most North American resource investors have exposure to Renaissance.&quot;</p>
<p>Calgary-based Renaissance said poor weather, maintenance at its Alberta and Saskatchewan oil facilities and delayed drilling in the second quarter cut production estimates to 85,000 barrels a day from a previously projected 92,500 barrels a day.</p>
<p>The senior exploration and production company, which has a market value approaching C$4.5 billion ($3.3 billion), produced 71,920 barrels a day last year.</p>
<p>Natural gas output was still forecast to average 450 million cubic feet a day, up from 380 million in 1996.</p>
<p>In a conference call with analysts in which he took full blame for the foul-up, Renaissance's Chief Executive Clayton Woitas admitted he should have released the weaker forecast a month ago when disappointing operating data began to surface.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did we choose yesterday, July the 9th, to make the announcement? This is where I screwed up big-time,&quot; an emotional Woitas said.</p>
<p>The news triggered a major selloff in Renaissance stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange, with investors lopping C$3.20, or more than eight percent, off its share price, which closed at C$36.10 in busy trade of over 1.8 million shares on Thursday.</p>
<p>The TSE's oil and gas subindex shed 94.87 points, or 1.36 percent, after the news. Renaissance stock makes up 9.51 percent of the group.</p>
<p>The multi-sector TSE 300 Composite Index, meanwhile, was up 18.29 points.</p>
<p>Renaissance had been on track to meet its targets at its annual meeting in late April, but lagging second-quarter performance was evident by the time of the mid-June Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers investment conference, the industry's premier meeting of company executives, analysts and portfolio managers, Woitas explained.</p>
<p>&quot;We were close to making that decision (to revise the projection) at that time. Only arrogance and stupidity and some not-yet-available data precluded me from making that decision,&quot; he acknowledged.</p>
<p>Instead of initially living with reduced expectations, Woitas put pressure on employees to meet the previous target.</p>
<p>&quot;As my tension level increased, their tension level increased,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not how we've built our company. We've built it based upon cutting out external influences and being in control. By racing to meet the ultimate number, that was put in jeopardy.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the lower projection, Woitas said Renaissance did not change its 1997 earnings estimate of C$130 million ($95 million). At the company's annual meeting, it projected earnings of C$140 million ($102 million).</p>
<p>The company raised its average natural gas price forecast to C$1.90 ($1.39) per thousand cubic feet from C$1.75 ($1.28), which was expected to make up for the difference.</p>
