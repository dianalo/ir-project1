<headline>Norway's Statoil sees Hungary/Poland gas deals.</headline>
<text>
<p>COPENHAGEN, June 13, Reuter - Norwegian oil and gas company Statoil is optimistic that it will be able to conclude deals to supply natural gas to Hungary and Poland, Statoil President Harald Norvik said on Friday.</p>
<p>Pointing out that the recent sale of 3 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year to the Czech Republic showed that it was possible to arrive at commercially sound agreements in central Europe, Norvik said:</p>
<p>&quot;We have also started negotiations with Polish Oil and Gas Company (POGC) and Hungarian MOL, and we trust that solutions can be found also for these countries.&quot; Norvik was addressing the 20th World Gas Conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I can confirm those negotiations,&quot; Janos Szito, director of gas trading at MOL, told Reuters. &quot;They officially started on January 30, although there were some preliminary talks earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that Hungary was negotiating to buy up to 2 bcm a year, starting in 2002 or 2003 and reaching a plateau in 2005. No decision has yet been taken on how it should be imported.</p>
<p>Hungary currently consumes 12.5 bcm a year, he said, and this is expected to grow to 16 or 17 bcm by 2010.</p>
<p>Most of MOL's gas comes from Russia, he said, although Hungary has domestic production of 4.5 bcm and also imports 0.5 bcm from Germany's Ruhrgas and 0.4 bcm from Gaz de France.</p>
<p>Boleslaw Rey, Director of Foreign Relations at POGC, said that discussions between POGC and Statoil (Den norske stats oljeselskap) den had originally started in the early 1990's but broke down and were not restarted until the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>He gave few details, saying nothing had yet been resolved, but added that the volume under discussion was &quot;some few bcm a year,&quot; probably around 3 bcm or 4 bcm. --Sebastian Alison, Copenhagen Newsroom, +45 33 96 96 50</p>
