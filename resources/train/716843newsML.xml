<p>Shares powered to another all-time high close in brisk trade on Wednesday, led by sharp gains in Nokia and forestries and with further upside seen, brokers said.</p>
<p>The FOX index rose 1.63 percent to a life-high 1,167.01 percent, while the all-share HEX rose 1.79 percent to a record 3,407.35 points. Volume was a hefty 792 million markka.</p>
<p>&quot;In the near term, there's no reason this trend shouldn't continue,&quot; one broker said, adding: &quot;These price levels look high, but so far there are hardly any signs of a sell-off.&quot;</p>
<p>Nokia rose 17.50 markka to a life-high 430.00 close.</p>
<p>With Nokia opening higher on Wall Street, brokers said the share looked set to keep its gains which were sparked by above-forecast second-quarter earnings from Motorola on Tuesday.</p>
<p>An overnight surge in U.S. paper-makers helped forestries outperform, the subindex gaining 2.58 percent. UPM-Kymmene led the way, closing up 4.20 markka at 132.00 after touching an all-time high 132.20 in heavy 222 million markka trade.</p>
<p>Enso added 0.50 markka to close at 49.90 in sturdy volume, and Metsa-Serla gained 1.00 to end at 46.00.</p>
<p>Even after an upswing of 35 percent in the FOX index since the start of the year, brokers said Finnish stocks still have potential to rise as long as the U.S. bull run continues.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the same problem as in the U.S. -- if you sell your shares, you don't know what to do with the money because you can easily fall behind your benchmark index in just a week,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Mining and metals group Outokumpu was the third most traded share after Nokia and UPM, and brokers said it continued to attract overseas interest. It closed off 0.50 markka at 104.00 after trading flat for most of the session.</p>
<p>Banking group Merita tested 20.00 markka again in fair trade, but failed to find a foothold, ending up 0.30 at 19.90.</p>
<p>Engineering group Metra closed up 2.00 markka at 171.00 after touching 174.00 in solid 14 million markka volume. Brokers said it was helped by a 580 million markka engine order from Africa for its Wartsila NSD unit.</p>
<p>But some said Metra's gains may have been curbed by news that Swedish lock maker Assa Abloy -- in which Metra owns a big stake -- had applied to remove its shares from the main Stockholm bourse list to put them on the smaller O list.</p>
