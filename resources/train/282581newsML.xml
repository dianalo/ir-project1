<title>SINGAPORE: Asian crudes steady, Tapis boost amid shut-ins.</title>
<headline>Asian crudes steady, Tapis boost amid shut-ins.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Crude prices in Asia held steady on Tuesday but light sweet grades firmed as Australian production was hit by Cyclone Phil.</p>
<p>Operators of the 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) Cossack and 70,000 bpd Griffin fields shut down Monday and at least one major could face a scheduling disruption because of the shut down, traders said.</p>
<p>Barrow Island was producing but not berthing and the Wandoo field, which produces a heavy crude, was shut in.</p>
<p>Operators and traders said the fields could look to restart by the end of the week.  </p>
<p>Traders said the shut downs played into the hands of the Tapis market, where a producer sold 300,000 barrels of first half February crude to a European major at a premium of $1.60.</p>
<p>The European major is making up a full cargo of 600,000 to 650,000 barrels of Tapis, which is destined for a joint-venture refinery in China.</p>
<p>The producer is now offering its February barrels at $1.70 premium -- supported by the Australian stoppages.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, futures prices languished on SIMEX with nothing traded and only an offer shown on the most active February contract.  </p>
<p>NYMEX February crude, trading on ACCESS, was steady at $25.36, down just one cent from the New York close.</p>
<p>Brent/Dubai spreads were wide, with February offered at $2.00 and a notional bid put at $1.80.</p>
<p>February/March Dubai was firmer but wide at 50/65 cents from 50/55 in New York.</p>
