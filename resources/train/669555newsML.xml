<p>Activity in Czech equities rose sharply on Wednesday as SPT Telecom, the most heavily weighted Czech share, returned to the market after being suspended ahead of its annual general meeting.</p>
<p>SPT, with a 19.7 percent weighting on the index and a market capitalisation of 80.5 billion crowns, rose 75 crowns to 3,370.</p>
<p>&quot;SPT was back in the market and people were just attracted back a bit to Czech shares. It's a good company which is quite cheap so I could see it going further up,&quot; said one local dealer.  </p>
<p>SPT has fallen 2.69 percent since the beginning of the year but has outperformed the PX50 by 3.71 percent.</p>
<p>Power utility CEZ rose 20 crowns to 915. CEZ has been one of the hardest hit of the blue chip issues by the general downturn in Czech equities which has seen the PX50 fall 6.17 percent since January 1.</p>
<p>CEZ has declined by 8.6 percent since the beginning of the year underperforming the PX50 index by 2.26 percent.</p>
