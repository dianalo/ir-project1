<headline>FORECAST - BA profits head for new heights.</headline>

<p>British Airways Plc is expected to report another record year for profits on Monday, fuelled by continued strong growth in passenger traffic and higher fare yields.</p>
<p>Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 to come in at 600-630 million stg, comfortably ahead of last year's all-time high of 585 million stg. The total dividend payout is expected to rise to 15 pence from 13.65p, on earnings up around seven pecent at 47-48 pence a share.</p>
<p>BA's share price has already outperformed the London market by 25 percent in the last year, hitting the dizzy new heights on Friday of 752, against forecast earnings for the current year of 54 pence a share, according to Reuters 3000 data supplied by Edinburgh Financial.</p>
<p>Worldwide demand for air travel is forecast to go on growing at five to six percent a year into the next century, so the outlook should remain bright for as long as airlines control their appetites for new aircraft.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very difficult company to bet against,&quot; said Mike Powell of NatWest Markets. &quot;It depends a lot on the supply/demand balance, and we see the supply side as pretty tight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;New aircraft deliveries are picking up but as a proportion of the world fleet it's not that much of a problem and retirals are picking up as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;With load factors where they are the pressure on fares, particularly on long-haul, remains gently upwards.&quot;</p>
<p>BA has already reported that its paying passenger  traffic was up 6.4 percent in the 12 months to end-March, taking up most of the 7.3 percent of extra capacity put on last year. As a result average loadings were down just 0.6 points at 73.2 percent.</p>
<p>But there could be more good news to come on Monday, if BA can keep the extra costs of dealing with more customers under control.</p>
<p>Last year airlines were hit by a sharp jump in fuel prices, which kept a lid on BA's profits, but oil prices have fallen back since the end of March.</p>
<p>NatWest's Powell estimates that BA's fuel bill jumped by 200 million stg to 844 million stg last year but says the outlook for crude oil prices suggests BA could add back in about 90 million stg in profits this year.</p>
<p>Attention on Monday will also be directed to what BA has to say about prospects for getting its alliance with American Airlines off the ground after a year of regulatory battles.</p>
<p>And BA has also promised to say something in the results about the progress of its ambitious &quot;Business Efficiency&quot; programme, aimed at finding a billion stg in annual cost savings by the year 2000 from outsourcing and rationalisation of all parts of the business.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going great guns,&quot; said Powell. &quot;But the quicker they do it the more of the savings will reach the bottom line, because ultimately they will all get competed away,&quot; he said.</p>
