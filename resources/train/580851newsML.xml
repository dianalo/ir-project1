<p>An Indonesian man was sentenced to death on Tuesday for the murder of three people in the United States, one of them his brother.</p>
<p>The central Jakarta district court found Harnoko Dewantono guilty of killing two Indonesians and an Indian citizen in Los Angeles in 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;We sentenced the defendant to death because we cannot find reasons to acquit him. The defendant has sadistically and cruelly murdered his own brother and his close friends,&quot; presiding judge I.G.K. Sukarata said in the verdict.</p>
<p>Dewantono, wearing a black suit and tie, showed no emotion when the sentence was handed down. He said he would appeal against the verdict.</p>
<p>If his appeal is rejected, he can ask for a presidential pardon.</p>
<p>Government prosecutors said Dewantono killed Indian business partner Suresh Mirchandani in August 1991 and murdered his brother Erry Prihartono and his Indonesian school friend Gina Sutan Anwar in 1992.</p>
<p>Government prosecutors said Mirchandani died of a bullet wound in his chest and that his body was wrapped in a plastic bag with the hands chopped off. Anwar and Prihartono died after being hit on the head with blunt objects.</p>
<p>Los Angeles police unsuccessfully sought the extradition of Dewantono, a former U.S. resident, after the three bodies were found in a leased storage locker in August 1994. Dewantono had by then returned to Indonesia, where he was arrested and tried.</p>
