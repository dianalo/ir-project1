<p>Pressure is mounting on India's centre-left government to raise oil prices to curb its runaway subsidy bill, but the coalition might wait before taking the unpopular decision, officials and analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a little too early for the government to start applying its mind to it,&quot; a petroleum ministry official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A United Front government, headed by Inder Kumar Gujral, assumed office last Monday after former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda lost a confidence vote in parliament on April 11.</p>
<p>The 15-party coalition agreed to make Gujral prime minister to win back support from the Congress party and stay in power.</p>
<p>The petroleum ministry official said Gujral's cabinet had yet to discuss formally measures to contain the growing oil pool deficit.</p>
<p>The oil pool account is a balancing mechanism whereby refineries are compensated for subsidised prices of several petroleum products in India.</p>
<p>The account for 1996/97 (April-March) is estimated to be running a deficit of 155 billion rupees ($4.3 billion).</p>
<p>Petroleum ministry officials said the total subsidy on petroleum products in 1996/97 (April-March) was estimated at 184 billion rupees ($5.1 billion), including 83 billion rupees on kerosene and 64 billion on diesel.</p>
<p>Farmers and low-income groups are supplied with diesel and kerosene at subsidised rates.</p>
<p>R.K. Pachouri, head of the independent Tata Energy Research Institute, said the time was ripe for the new government to increase prices of diesel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas.</p>
<p>&quot;Gujral is fresh as prime minister and should seize the advantage,&quot; said Pachouri.&quot;He should do it this week. That is the first thing the government should address.&quot;</p>
<p>Pachouri said the longer this government took to make a decision, the greater the problems.</p>
<p>The country's demand for petroleum products is forecast to rise to about 81 million tonnes in the year ending March 31, 1997, from 74.7 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>India imported 47.68 million tonnes of crude oil and petroleum products in 1995/96.</p>
<p>A. Bhattacharyya, economic adviser in the petroleum ministry, said the ministry was discussing either abolishing the subsidy scheme or raising prices to tackle the oil pool deficit. He said he expected higher petroleum product prices in June.</p>
<p>India raised its petroleum product prices, mainly motor spirit, in July 1996. The decision, criticised by the Congress and left-wing parties, sparked country-wide protests.</p>
<p>Bhattacharyya said by June 30, the state-run Indian Oil Corporation would exhaust its external commercial borrowing limit of $2.9 billion and come under tremendous pressure on the pricing of its oil imports.</p>
<p>Oil analysts said the government would need to act quickly and show the political will to take decisions in the country's interest. ($1 = 35.7 rupees)</p>
