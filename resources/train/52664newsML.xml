<p>The Brazilian economy, which has been in the doldrums for nearly a year, is expected to be given a boost by the approval of a bill exempting exports and capital goods from a heavy tax.</p>
<p>The measure should increase gross domestic product by 1.5 percent annually, adding $110 billion to the expected total GDP of the next four years, Planning Minister Antonio Kandir told reporters after the bill was approved in the Senate on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The impact is going to be very strong,&quot; beamed Kandir who drew up the legislation years ago while a federal deputy and saw it signed by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Friday.</p>
<p>Primary and semi-manufactured exports and electricity used in manufacturing will be exempt from an ICMS sales as will circulation tax on goods and services once the law is published in Brazil's Official Gazette, probably on Monday.</p>
<p>Primary and semi-manufactured goods account for about 45 percent of Brazil exports and carry an ICMS charge of up to 13 percent. Manufactured exports are already exempt from ICMS.  </p>
<p>From November 1, imported capital goods will also be exempt and the law will be expanded to other items used in the manufacturing process from January 1, 1998.</p>
<p>The ICMS, which is levied at the state level, is Brazil's single most important tax, accounting for 47 billion reais of 180 billion reais raised by the three levels of government in 1995.</p>
<p>There was more good news for exports on Thursday when the Senate followed up the ICMS legislation by approving a bill to cut a 20 percent surcharge on port tariffs at public ports.  </p>
<p>Kandir said the overall effect of his bill would make it 15-30 percent cheaper for companies to invest, produce and hire. &quot;The cost of doing business in Brazil is starting to recede very swiftly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some private economists said Kandir's predictions may prove a little high in the short term. &quot;We're looking at an intial boost of 0.5 pct of GDP,&quot; said Elenora Santos, an analyst at Rio de Janeiro investment bank Fonte Cindam.</p>
<p>Santos added, however, that the ICMS exemptions would further help GDP in the long-term as the beneficial effects of more capital goods imports began to be felt.  </p>
<p>The bill effectively puts in place one of the main aims of a constitutional reform of Brazil's taxation system that the government had been expected to launch in Congress this year -- reducing the tax burden on exporters.</p>
<p>But it only satisfied the powerful state governors after compensation was promised in the form of debt paper, to be used to trim their debt to the Treasury, and clauses to end a &quot;tax-break war&quot; were scrapped.  </p>
<p>Several small states insisted that a proposed ban on fiscal incentives, principally through ICMS breaks, left them helpless to compete with more developed regions like Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>Some Brasilia-watchers remarked that the proximity to the first round of municipal elections on October 3 may have contributed to the timing of the bill's approval.</p>
<p>Sen. Jose Serra, Kandir's predecessor as planning minister and a struggling candidate in the Sao Paulo mayoral race, told the upper house session that approved the bill that he had fought long and hard for its approval.</p>
<p>&quot;All he forgot to tell us was his number on voting forms,&quot; joked a seasoned Congress journalist.</p>
