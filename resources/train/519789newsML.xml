<p>With their title hopes all but gone, Barcelona must regroup ahead of Sunday's clash with Athletic Bilbao which could prove vital in deciding who takes Spain's second Champions' League place.</p>
<p>With just eight games left, the clash will be one of four in which Bobby Robson's side take on teams from the top seven slots in the league.</p>
<p>Wednesday's fixture with sixth-placed Valladolid went badly wrong when Robson's men threw away an early lead to crash 3-1.</p>
<p>The result, combined with Real Madrid's dramatic comeback from 2-0 down to beat Sevilla 4-2, left Barcelona 10 points adrift of their arch-rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;The league is lost,&quot; said Hristo Stoickhov, the fiery Bulgarian not generally known for defeatism.</p>
<p>Inevitably the result renewed criticism of Robson, who was labelled &quot;the worst coach in the world&quot; by one Spanish newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;Being the worst in the world, we're not doing badly,&quot; said the former England coach, who reminded reporters his side were still in with a chance of taking both the Spanish Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup.</p>
<p>Amid widespread reports of the imminent arrival of former Ajax coach Louis van Gaal, Robson responded to questions about his future by saying he had heard nothing from the Catalan club.</p>
<p>Barcelona fans will not easily forgive Robson for allowing Real Madrid to steal this season's honours and will be livid if their side misses out on a place in the Champions' League for the third consecutive year.</p>
<p>Real Betis and Deportivo Coruna both have easier schedules in the race for second place in the Spanish championship -- and with it a shot at the continent's top club competition.</p>
<p>Barcelona will face up both sides plus leaders Real Madrid in the run-in.</p>
<p>But first Robson's side must taken on the Athletic Bilbao side that ended Barca's unbeaten record in dramatic fashion earlier this season by overturning a first half lead to win.</p>
<p>That match ended with an angry confrontation between Barcelona's Josep Guardiola and vociferous Bilbao boss Luis Fernandez, who had run on to the field to celebrate.</p>
<p>Fernandez, a former French World Cup player, has pulled his side out of a rut and now looks on course to clinch a UEFA Cup place for next season.</p>
