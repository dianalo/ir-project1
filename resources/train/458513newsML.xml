<p>Following are extracts from a document published by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin following their summit meeting:</p>
<p>&quot;FACT SHEET -- JOINT STATEMENT ON U.S.-RUSSIA ECONOMIC INITIATIVE&quot;</p>
<p>...The Presidents undertook to strengthen Russia's historic transformation to  market economy, foster new opportunities for trade and investment, and stimulate jobs in both countries.</p>
<p>U.S. and international economic cooperation with Russia has contributed to an ongoing and unprecedented transformation toward the development of a free market, including:</p>
<p>* an emerging private sector which now produces 70 percent of Russia's national income and employs 55 percent of its labour force;</p>
<p>* macroeconomic stabilisation, including a steady rouble and sharply reduced inflation, from 131 percent in 1995 to 22 percent in 1996;</p>
<p>* appreciation of Russia's stock market by 400 percent from March 1996 to March 1997 -- with Russians and foreigners able for the first time to trade Russian stocks and bonds:</p>
<p>* privatisation of more property, over 120,000 enterprises, in a shorter time than any such venture in history.</p>
<p>President Yeltsin has undertaken a bold agenda to stimulate investment and launch Russia on its next phase of economic reform, including:</p>
<p>* comprehensive tax reform to simplify and streamline value-added, excise, and corporate and individual income taxes;</p>
<p>* laws to strengthen Production Sharing Agreements needed to realize $50-60 billion in energy sector investments;</p>
<p>* tough anti-crime laws, including a criminal procedure code and laws against money laundering and organized crime: and</p>
<p>* ratification of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Investment Treaty.</p>
<p>To encourage business development, President Clinton underscored that OPIC and EXIM will intensify efforts to support investment in Russia....</p>
<p>Both Presidents will work together to promote Russia's integration with the international economic community. The presidents will undertake every effort for Russia to join the Paris Club in 1997 and the World Trade Organisation in 1998, subject to Russia meeting commercial terms commonly applied to new members, and to progress steadily to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development...</p>
<p>For Americans and Russians alike, this will mean new opportunities for trade and investment and contribute to a more prosperous and stable international economic order...</p>
