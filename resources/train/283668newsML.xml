<p>The Polish zloty strengthened against the currency basket as weak currency selling on client orders moved the shallow market despite a rising dollar/mark, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market could liven up no sooner than on Monday as many players would return from holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar/zloty rate did not follow dollar/mark as only a few players were active and covered clients needs, which were to sell currency,&quot; said Piotr Czyzewski from ING Bank in Warsaw.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed at 2.96/2.92 percent from the trading band centre, stronger than 1996's close at 2.86/2.78 percent. It closed at 2.8632/42 to the dollar, up from 2.8740/70 on Tuesday and at 1.8516/25 to the mark, down from 1.8485/05.</p>
<p>One-day deposit rates were flat and the market remained balanced despite the central bank's open market operations. Overnight deposit rates were quoted at 21.00/22.00 percent against the opening's 21.30/21.65 percent.</p>
<p>The NBP sold 100 million zlotys of 91-day bills at an average yield 0.06 point up to 21.91 percent against the last 13-week primary T-bill yield of 18.81 percent. </p>
<p>It sold also 300 million zlotys of 182-day bills at an average yield 0.02 point up at 21.97 percent against the last primary 26-week T-bill yield of 19.30 percent.</p>
<p>Tomorrow/next rates were at 21.45/21.75 percent against the opening's 21.35/21.75 percent despite the NBP drained 217 million zlotys at flat maximum rate of 21.64 percent.</p>
