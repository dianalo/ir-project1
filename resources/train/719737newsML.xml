<headline>Eurotunnel says has votes for debt plan.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-07-10</dateline>

<p>A source at Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel said on Thursday that the group had sufficient votes in favour of a 70 billion franc debt restructuring plan.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel needs the approval of holders of two-thirds of the French shares and three-quarters of the British shares to pursue the deal struck in April with its leading bank lenders.</p>
<p>The source said the company had a &quot;crushing majority&quot; of votes, sufficient to clear both hurdles, at the extraordinary general meeting.  </p>
<p>The company said in a statement earlier that votes for 272.3 million shares were present or represented at the meeting, or 29.62 percent of the total.</p>
<p>It said executive chairman Patrick Ponsolle held proxies for 177.7 million votes representing 19.32 percent.</p>
<p>Christian Cambier of the Eurotunnel Shareholders' Association, who said before the meeting that his group would vote for the deal, holds proxies for 2.05 percent.</p>
<p>Shareholder rights activist Sophie l'Helias and FGIS, who will also vote in favour, have 0.80 percent.</p>
<p>Albert Jauffret of shareholder group Adacte, who said he would vote the 12 million shares for which he had proxies against the deal, had not signed the acceptances for the mandates given to him, Eurotunnel said.</p>
<p>Belgium's Tractebel and its Belga Manche unit will vote their 10 million shares in favour of the deal, Tractebel said.</p>
<p>The deal would slash interest charges to 3.2 billion francs this year from 5.7 billion paid in 1996, giving the company breathing room, but also reduce shareholders' equity to 54.5 percent with Eurotunnel's creditor banks taking 45.5 percent.</p>
