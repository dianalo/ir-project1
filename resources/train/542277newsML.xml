<p>Ferdinand Piech, the head of German carmaker Volkswagen AG (VW), said on Sunday that he plans to more than quadruple the group's pre-tax profit by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Piech said in Focus news magazine that he plans to enhance earnings further by reducing the number of model bases, or the foundation structures on which the different types of car are built.  </p>
<p>&quot;By 2002 we plan to reduce the number of models from 19 now to around four -- which means one model base for small cars like the Polo, one for the Golf class and one each for the medium and top class models,&quot; Piech said.</p>
<p>This would allow the carmaker to maximise the use of those parts not seen by the customer in producing vehicles at its different units -- VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda -- and save money in production and in the supply of spare parts.</p>
<p>Europe's biggest carmaker reported pre-tax profits of nearly two billion marks in 1996.  </p>
<p>The group also plans to move into the upper end of the luxury car market and Piech said the group was &quot;very interested&quot; in the 100,000 mark upwards category under the Volkswagen marque.</p>
<p>VW would produce a car to compete with the upmarket Mercedes S-class model by the time the Expo 2000 fair in Hanover takes place, Piech said.</p>
<p>&quot;Audi will compete with BMW, VW will compete with Daimler-Benz,&quot; Piech said.  </p>
<p>Piech said he saw production at its Mexican plant at Puebla doubling to over 300,000 units, with similar growth rates in the group's Asian business, especially in the areas which are currently relatively weak.</p>
<p>While the forecasts on the production side for Volkswagen looked healthy, the group said on Saturday that it missed out on pre-tax profits of around 1.3 billion marks in 1996 by hedging itself against falls in the dollar, sterling and mark which did not materialise.  </p>
<p>&quot;The number is about right,&quot; spokesman Klaus Kocks said in response to a report in the news weekly Der Spiegel, which also said VW had set aside reserves of one billion marks in its end-1996 balance sheet for currency transactions.</p>
<p>But Kocks insisted that VW's failure to make money on the higher mark-value of its dollar, sterling and lira income was the result of its deliberately low-risk hedging policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We can live with the accusation of being too conservative,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Der Spiegel quoted VW currency expert Rutbert Reisch as saying the company had not suffered a loss, but had missed out on a chance to make a higher profit.</p>
<p>Spiegel said that VW was seeking to rule out a repeat of the situation in 1986 when the group lost nearly half-a-million marks in currency speculation losses.</p>
